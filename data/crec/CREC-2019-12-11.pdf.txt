IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR ALL
STUDENTS AT ALL LEVELS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI) for 5 minutes.
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate the passage of
the Every Student Succeeds Act, which
President Obama signed into law 4
years ago yesterday.
When I came to Congress, updating
the Elementary and Secondary Edu-
cation Act was one of my top prior-
ities, and I was proud to stand with
President Obama on the day that we fi-
nally left behind No Child Left Behind.
More than 50 years ago, President
Lyndon Johnson signed the Elemen-
tary and Secondary Education Act into
law, and he said ESEA represents a
major new commitment of the Federal
Government to quality and equality in
the schooling that we offer our young
people.
I agree with President Johnson.
When we promote and realize equity in
education, when we expand and invest
in educational opportunities, we can
improve outcomes for all students at
all levels.
Reauthorizing ESEA in 2015 was
meant to put us closer to achieving
that equality envisioned in the original
law, but there is still much work to be
done.
ESSA created new opportunities to
make sure that all students, regardless
of their race, color, national origin,
ZIP Code, or family wealth, could have
an equal opportunity to obtain a high-
quality public education.
It returned flexibility and autonomy
to States and districts to set high
standards for all students, to evaluate
schools using multiple measures of stu-
dent learning, and to design systems
for identifying schools in need of addi-
tional support.
With provisions I championed, States
were also given the ability to eliminate
unnecessary or duplicative testing and
access to resources for fewer, better
quality assessments. Importantly, the
Every Student Succeeds Act put more
emphasis on well-rounded education
that prepares students to be creative,
critical thinkers.
Since ESSA’s passage, I have worked
hard with appropriators to make sure
Congress fulfills the commitments
made in this law with robust funding of
Student Support and Academic Enrich-
ment Grants.
As we continue to implement this
law, strong Federal accountability and
support are necessary to make sure
that the flexibility and autonomy that
States and districts now have is used
to identify and close achievement gaps,
rather than to shirk responsibility to
students. We know there is more work
to be done in that area, as well.
Unfortunately, the current Depart-
ment of Education is more focused on
privatizing education than on making
sure that the States fully implement
the law. They are not holding States
accountable for improving outcomes of
disadvantaged students. This is most
noticeable in the Department’s ap-
proval of State plans that ignore the
performance of subgroups altogether
and the lack of guidance and regula-
tion available to help States imple-
ment the Every Student Succeeds Act.
As we reflect on passage of the Every
Student Succeeds Act and the opportu-
nities it provides, I urge the Depart-
ment of Education and Secretary
DeVos to support States and hold them
accountable for implementing this law
with fidelity. My colleagues on the
Education and Labor Committee will
continue our robust oversight of the
Department’s implementation to make
sure that the Every Student Succeeds
Act fulfills a promise we made to all
students when President Obama signed
it into law.

RECOGNIZING MISSISSIPPI
FOOTBALL STATE CHAMPIONS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Mississippi (Mr. KELLY) for 5 minutes.
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, today, I rise to recognize five
2019 Mississippi football State cham-
pionship teams that hail from my dis-
trict.
In 1A, the Nanih Waiya Warriors de-
feated the Lumberton Panthers 28-to-
14.

H10020 December 11, 2019
In 6A, the Oxford Chargers defeated
the Oak Grove Warriors 31-to-21.
Finally, in MAIS 5A, the Heritage
Academy Patriots defeated the
Starkville Academy Volunteers 55-to-
10.
There is nothing that brings Mis-
sissippi together more than Friday
night lights, and to have this many
championship teams in the First Dis-
trict is quite an honor.
I am proud of the young men who
gave their all in the heat of August
two-a-days, the regular season and the
playoffs, and, finally, at The Rock in
Hattiesburg to win a State champion-
ship.
I recognize the hard work and dedica-
tion of the bands, cheerleaders, dance
teams, and all the other participants
who make football games such an ex-
citing Friday night community event
in Mississippi.
I thank the parents who drove their
children to and from practice and spent
every Friday night in the fall driving
across the State of Mississippi to
watch their kids compete on the field.
Finally, I express my heartfelt grati-
tude to the teachers, school adminis-
trators, and coaches who work every
day to make sure that our kids have a
bright future on the field and in the
classroom.
f
SUPPORT LOWER DRUG COSTS
NOW
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH) for 5 minutes.
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, today, I
rise in support of H.R. 3, the Lower
Drug Costs Now Act.
I thank the Speaker and my col-
leagues for working so hard to bring
this important piece of legislation to
the floor. I believe there are few issues
more significant and few issues more
impactful to the lives of everyday
Americans than the ever-increasing
costs of healthcare and the lack of ac-
cess to vital treatment.
As a two-time breast cancer survivor,
I know all too well the stress and the
heartache of a life-changing diagnosis.
Treatment was exhausting, both phys-
ically and emotionally, but I was truly
blessed to be able to afford my medica-
tion.
Even today, I continue to pay exces-
sive out-of-pocket costs for my medica-
tion. However, I am lucky to be in a
position where I do not have to make
serious sacrifices to pay for the care
that I need.
Unfortunately, this is not reality for
all Americans. We live in the richest
Nation in the history of nations. This
is the greatest country on Earth. I
refuse to believe that we cannot find a
solution that allows every American to
afford the medications that they need.
I have been shocked by the stories
from my constituents about how phar-
maceutical companies continue to
gouge their pocketbooks and affect
their quality of life.
I heard a story recently of a mother
in my district who wrote in about her
son, who is 27 and has type 1 diabetes.
He pays $400 a month for his insulin
while also trying to repay his college
loans from pursuing his master’s de-
gree. She wrote in to speak for her son
because she is scared. Her son experi-
ences the same hardship that so many
Americans do because of a diagnosis
they did not choose.
Too often, stories like this end with
a patient resorting to rationing of es-
sential treatments, often with cata-
strophic results.
These are lifesaving medications.
They are not optional, and people
should never have to make the un-
thinkable decision about whether to
purchase their medications or put food
on their tables or gas in their cars.
On average, Americans pay three to
four times as much for the same pre-
scription drugs as people in other coun-
tries. Over the last two decades alone,
the price of insulin has increased by
1,000 percent. There is no reasonable
explanation for these costs, and the
American people have had enough.
The constantly rising prices have far-
reaching consequences, increasing the
price of health insurance premiums and
eating into workers’ wages.
Let us be clear, it is taxpayer dollars
and wages that go toward paying for
these outrageous prescription drug
prices, and it is time for Congress to
say that enough is enough.
This is the most comprehensive solu-
tion to our country’s drug pricing prob-
lem ever to be seriously considered by
the House of Representatives. This leg-
islation would give Medicare the power
to negotiate directly with the drug
companies and create a powerful mech-
anism that forces drug companies to
the table to compromise on real price
reductions.
It also stops pharmaceutical compa-
nies from overcharging Americans
while charging other countries less for
the same drugs, and it creates a $2,000
out-of-pocket limit on prescription
drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries.
Finally, it will reverse years of un-
fair price hikes above inflation across
thousands of drugs in Medicare, mak-
ing lower drug prices negotiated by
Medicare available to Americans with
private insurance, not just Medicare
beneficiaries.
The Lower Drug Costs Now Act is a
good deal for the American people. It
saves the taxpayers over $450 billion
during the next decade and allows us to
make long-sought-after investments
into Medicare and the National Insti-
tutes of Health.
In fact, this bill includes legislation
that I wrote to include coverage of
hearing aids in Medicare, making them
affordable for our seniors. It will also
deliver vision and dental benefits while
investing huge sums into the search for
new cures.
All the mothers and fathers who lay
awake at night worried about enrolling
their kids in after-school activities or
making their mortgage or car pay-
ments will benefit from this bill. We
are fighting for them, and it is a fight
that we intend to win.
f
HONORING THE LIFE AND
SACRIFICE OF STEPHEN CARR
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Arkansas (Mr. WOMACK) for 5 minutes.
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, it is
with a heavy heart that I rise today to
honor the life, service, and sacrifice of
a hero from the Third District of the
great State of Arkansas, Fayetteville
Police Officer Stephen Carr.
On Saturday, December 7, Officer
Carr was preparing to begin another
shift of keeping his community safe
when he was cowardly ambushed and
executed, most likely because of the
uniform he wore.
We have lost one of our finest law en-
forcement officers, someone who dedi-
cated his life to serving Arkansas and
defending others. Officer Carr made it
his mission to make our State a safer
place for everyone.
Officer Carr served as a protector,
promoted peace and justice, and dem-
onstrated the valor and integrity that
the uniform embodies.
Our hearts are broken as we grieve
this unthinkable loss. Today, we vow
never to forget his memory and pledge
to honor his life of service forever. I
join all of Arkansas this morning in
the mourning of the loss of Officer Ste-
phen Carr. Our prayers are with his
family, his loved ones, and the Fay-
etteville Police Department.
I also recognize Corporal Seay Floyd
and Officer Natalie Eucce, who imme-
diately engaged and eliminated the
suspect.
Our police deserve our deepest re-
spect and gratitude. While they know
the risks they face are greater than
ever, they refuse to shy away from
their mission to protect and serve.
Stephen Carr was a native of The
Woodlands, Texas. Mr. Speaker, my
friend and colleague Representative
KEVIN BRADY would have been on this
floor this morning to offer his condo-
lences to the family, a family that he
knew personally, but because of a
markup in the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, he is unable to be on the floor
with me this morning.
Mr. Speaker, if it please the House, I
would like to ask for a moment of si-
lence for Officer Carr, who will be laid
to rest tomorrow, and, in fact, for all of
our heroes who have faced the end of
watch.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10021
December 11, 2019
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with the
preeminent privilege and singular
honor of paying tribute to a great
American institution. I do so with H.
Res. 760, commemorating Houston
Methodist Hospital for 100 years of
service, 100 years of world-class
healthcare, 100 years of saving lives,
100 years of groundbreaking research.
Houston Methodist Hospital, the
world’s first multiorgan transplant
hospital; first coronary bypass, graft-
ing with the patient’s leg vein; ranked
the number one hospital in Texas for 8
consecutive years and a national honor
roll hospital by U.S. News and World
Report.
Houston Methodist has eight hos-
pitals, employing more than 23,000 per-
sons, 1.3 million patient encounters
last year alone, acknowledged for their
outstanding specialties in neurology,
neurosurgery, pulmonology, ortho-
pedics, cancer, cardiology, heart sur-
gery, and urology.
Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to say
that all of my colleagues in the Hous-
ton area are cosponsors of this resolu-
tion—original cosponsors, I might add.
This would include the Honorable SHEI-
LA JACKSON LEE, the Honorable LIZZIE
FLETCHER, the Honorable PETE OLSON,
the Honorable SYLVIA GARCIA, the Hon-
orable MICHAEL MCCAUL, the Honorable
RANDY WEBER, the Honorable BRIAN
BABIN, the Honorable DAN CRENSHAW,
and the Honorable KEVIN BRADY.
Houston Methodist has a great presi-
dent who not only responds to congres-
sional inquiries, but also to the pa-
tients themselves. I know. I have
known of patients who have actually
had the opportunity to see the presi-
dent of the hospital. Dr. Mark Boom is
the president. He is a medical doctor
himself, and he is the chief executive
officer.
This great institution is one that I
am proud to have in my congressional
district, I am proud to represent, and I
am also proud to say is a part of the
great institutions in the United States
of America.
Houston Methodist Hospital is cele-
brating its centennial, 100 years of
faithful service and saving lives, not
only in Houston, Harris County, in the
State of Texas, but across the world.
f
RECOGNIZING BUCKS COUNTY
ELITE GIRLS BASKETBALL PRO-
GRAM
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5
minutes.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the Bucks
County Elite Girls basketball program
and those who were recently recognized
by the Monroe Foundation for Youth
and presented awards for their service
to our community as well as for their
athletic and their academic achieve-
ments.
Over the last year and a half, the
team has won 11 tournaments. This is
an incredible achievement that speaks
to their teamwork, their coaching, and
their dedication. Moreover, many of
the team members are also honor stu-
dents, and many more are active com-
munity volunteers throughout our re-
gion.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to con-
gratulate the Bucks County Elite Girls
basketball program for this amazing
accomplishment, and we look forward
to their future success.
KEYSTONE FOOD DRIVE
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the incredible
work of the students, the staff, and the
families of Bristol Township’s Key-
stone Elementary School.
This holiday season, the Keystone
community came together to help 27
local families in need. The students
and staff at the school donated non-
perishable items throughout Novem-
ber, and Oldcastle Infrastructure of
Croydon, Pennsylvania, provided tur-
keys and pies to accompany the meal
baskets.
Mr. Speaker, this is the third con-
secutive year that Oldcastle Infrastruc-
ture has partnered with the Keystone
families. It is great to see our commu-
nities come together to help those fam-
ilies who have fallen on hard times,
and that is what makes neighbors so
great. They are always there to help
others in times of need.
Mr. Speaker, we hope to see this pro-
gram continue in the future, and we
hope other communities will follow
their lead.
SALUTE 2 SERVICE
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize Salute 2 Serv-
ice, a veteran outreach program based
in Bristol, Bucks County, Pennsyl-
vania.
Founded by Langhorne’s Rodney
Wyatt, Salute 2 Service prides itself on
its ability to provide a multitude of
services and resources for our veterans
in distress. In addition to extensive
work towards career growth and home-
less outreach, they help veterans
through local, State, and national ad-
vocacy, community activism, and
emergency assistance.
Mr. Speaker, the motto of Salute 2
Service is ‘‘Leave No Veteran Behind.’’
With nearly a half million unemployed
veterans across our great Nation, Sa-
lute 2 Service has vowed to help find
jobs for the servicemen and service-
women in our community.
I am proud to represent Salute 2
Service and Rodney, and I am glad to
see like-minded groups working to-
gether to help our veterans each and
every day.
f
SOCIAL SECURITY IS THE NORTH
STAR OF HUMANE PUBLIC POLICY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE) for 5 minutes.
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I am just
so thrilled and excited to be reintro-
ducing my Social Security reform bill,
the Social Security Enhancement and
Protection Act of 2019.
Today, our prized Social Security
program is at risk. Currently, Social
Security is fully funded until 2035 but
faces a financial shortfall after that.
And while there is broad agreement
that we need to take steps to improve
the fiscal outlook for Social Security,
there is not enough attention given to
the need to improve the system so that
it works better for vulnerable popu-
lations, including women, people of
color, and low-income people. My bill
would both improve benefits and ex-
tend the program’s solvency.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to draw
your attention to three critical compo-
nents of my bill:
My bill would modify the special
minimum benefit to credit workers for
up to 5 additional years of work to re-
flect the years workers provide care for
a child under 6 years old. This, of
course, is especially important for
women. We need to value caregiving
and acknowledge that this uncompen-
sated labor is not free. Mother work is
work.
My bill also extends the benefit eligi-
bility for children of retired, disabled,
or deceased workers who are full-time
students enrolled in college or voca-
tional schools up to the age of 26 years
old.
In this knowledge-based worldwide
economy, this benefit needs to be rein-
stated. It was particularly helpful to
students of color, low-income families
with parents working who were at
higher risk, those with parents who
were blue-collar workers, and women.
My bill also provides additional bene-
fits for all beneficiaries of any income
age 20 years after their retirement.
People who live beyond the age of 85—
God bless them—tend to be more likely
to be financially vulnerable, even with
their Social Security benefit. They
may have exhausted their savings by
this point or have more serious health
problems that may have been a drain
on their finances or have faced any
number of financial strains.
Mr. Speaker, Social Security has be-
come one of the hallmarks of our safe-
ty net, and I urge my colleagues to im-
prove this system, which has been an
integral part of our Nation.
Mr. Speaker, Social Security is the
North Star of humane public policy in
the United States, and I would invite
all of my colleagues the opportunity to
cosponsor this legislation and vote for
the Social Security Enhancement and
Protection Act of 2019.

After being named the District 10

Clifford was then nominated by his
peers at Greensburg Junior High
School and across the State to become
the State Principal of the Year.
Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate
Matthew for this tremendous honor

FIRST CHRISTIAN CHURCH GRANT
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
in support of the grant application sub-
mitted by the First Christian Church
of Columbus. This grant will save one
of America’s treasures in my district.
The First Christian Church has been
a staple in the Columbus community
for years and is a jewel of architecture
and history.
Since 2001, the First Christian
Church has been designated by the Na-
tional Park Service as a U.S. National
Historic Landmark, but now it needs
essential renovations. I pledge my sup-
port for this program so that this
church may be restored to its original
beauty.
IU HEALTH COMMUNITY INVESTMENT
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to express my support for IU Health’s
investment of $1 million into the Mun-
cie community.
Over the next 3 years, IU Health will
give $1 million toward revitalization of
the Thomas Park-Avondale and South
Central neighborhoods in southeast
Muncie. The investment plans include
bike lanes, walking trails, access to
better food, a new health center, and
much more.
I applaud IU Health for investing in
our local community and promoting
healthier Hoosiers.
INDIANA BROADBAND EXPANSION
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to show my support for $1.3 million in
rural broadband expansion in the Sixth
District.
In my time in Congress, I have
worked with local groups to address
broadband in schools and hospitals and
supported Distance Learning and Tele-
medicine grants. I have introduced a
bill to make sure Federal agencies ef-
fectively work together in this arena.
I am glad to see the Governor an-
nounce a boost for grants to counties
like Jennings, Scott, and my home
county of Bartholomew.
I look forward to seeing the State’s
continued work on this as I fight for
rural high-speed internet on behalf of
the Sixth District.

Nearly 600 veterans, including World
War II vets, gathered in Richmond to
enjoy an evening of celebration and
holiday cheer. A career fair was held
before dinner to help those in need to
access work opportunities, resources,
and support.
It was a privilege to speak at this ap-
preciation dinner, and I stand today to
wish every veteran across this country
and Indiana’s Sixth District a very
merry Christmas.
CONGRESS NEEDS TO ADDRESS RISING COST OF
HEALTHCARE
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to ask, for the American people, Con-
gress to do its job and address the ris-
ing cost of healthcare, but Speaker
PELOSI’s H.R. 3, is not the answer.
H.R. 3 will limit choice and innova-
tion. It is a partisan messaging bill
that will not be considered in the Sen-
ate or signed into law. We are letting
the American people down by not vot-
ing on bipartisan legislation that will
actually address skyrocketing drug
prices.
H.R. 3 would increase premiums
while punishing American innovation
and enabling foreign competitors to
flourish.
H.R. 19, the Republican’s alternative
drug pricing bill, is filled with more
than 40 bipartisan, commonsense re-
forms that reduce prescription drug
costs and increase access to affordable,
high-quality and lifesaving care for
Americans.
H.R. 19 expands low-cost options for
patients by bringing more generic com-
petition to the market.
It lowers out-of-pocket spending, pro-
tects patients’ access to new medicine
and cures, increases transparency, and
boosts innovation. The American peo-
ple should be empowered by bipartisan
proposals not restricted by partisan
politics to make the best healthcare
choices for themselves and their fami-
lies.
f
INABILITY TO AFFORD PRESCRIP-
TION DRUGS SHOULD NOT BE A
DEATH SENTENCE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Virginia (Ms. WEXTON) for 5 minutes.
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, a con-
stituent of mine named Josh aged out
of his parent’s health insurance when
he turned 26. Josh was a Type 1 dia-
betic and by then, his insulin cost was
nearly $1,200 per month.
So he switched to over-the-counter
insulin because, like so many others,
he couldn’t afford the prescription
brand recommended by his doctors. Al-
ready on a tight budget, Josh was en-
gaged and wanted to save up some
money for his wedding and building a
new life with his fiancee.
His mother knew that he had
changed his medication and when she
would check on him, his blood sugar
would be high, but he assured her that
he was all right and the insulin was
working.
He was alone at work in June of this
year when he suffered a series of
strokes that would prove fatal, and it
was his fiancee who found him.
We have miracle drugs that can save
lives, but they don’t do any good when
the American people can’t afford them.
In April, I hosted a roundtable with
constituents and healthcare providers
about the skyrocketing price of diabe-
tes medication. Nurses and phar-
macists shared stories about patients
who had no option but to ration their
insulin, putting their lives and their
health in serious jeopardy.
One, who ran a free clinic, spoke
about how refugees were absolutely
stunned at how much more Americans
were paying for their prescription
drugs than they had in the countries
that they were fleeing from.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support
H.R. 3, the Elijah Cummings Lower
Drug Costs Now Act because the inabil-
ity to afford necessary drugs should
not be a death sentence in the United
States of America.
We are going to give HHS the power
to negotiate lower drug prices for the
American people. And those lower
prices will be available not only to
Medicare beneficiaries, but also to
Americans with private health insur-
ance.
With the projected savings from this
bill, nearly half a trillion dollars, we
will provide vision, dental, and hearing
benefits for all Medicare beneficiaries
and invest in new medical research.
American families and seniors should
not pay more for their medications
than what the drug companies charge
people in other countries.
This bill is a win for the American
people. It represents a historic invest-
ment in Medicare and historic savings
on the cost of prescription drugs. With-
out this legislation, the rising price of
prescription drugs will continue to
take a toll on the finances of American
families, and in worst cases, cost lives.
What happened to Josh should never
happen to anyone in this country. I
urge my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle to support this lifesaving legisla-
tion.

SOCIALISM IS A PHILOSOPHY OF

Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, Winston
Churchill once said: ‘‘Socialism is the
philosophy of failure, the creed of igno-
rance, and the gospel of envy. Its inher-
ent virtue is the equal sharing of mis-
ery.’’
Despite the truth of these words, un-
fortunately, more and more young
Americans hold positive views of so-
cialism and negative views of cap-
italism. A recent Gallup Poll found
that 51 percent of young Americans
view socialism favorably, while only 45
percent view capitalism positively.
That marks a 12-point decline in the
popularity of capitalism just this dec-
ade.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10023
December 11, 2019
So the question is, Why are increas-
ing numbers of our young people sup-
porting socialism?
The answer is, because they have
been told that it is somehow ‘‘moral’’
and ‘‘compassionate’’ and ‘‘fair’’ by
leading socialist voices in media and
government, mostly concentrated in
and around Washington, D.C.
On the surface, one might think that
taking from the prosperous for the bet-
terment of the poor is a decent and fair
policy. But just under the surface lies a
fundamental ignorance of one of the
most foundational principles of human
behavior, and that is, incentives.
Socialism doesn’t reward people for
hard work, creativity, and entrepre-
neurial spirit. In reality, the over-
whelming taxation necessary to sup-
port socialist policies penalizes people
who work hard by forcing them to send
their earnings, perhaps thousands of
miles away, to Washington, D.C.
The incentive that is created is one
of mediocrity; that it would be just
easier to settle for economic scraps in-
stead of shooting for the Moon and pur-
suing the American Dream.
And what about the supposed bene-
ficiaries of socialism, the middle and
the lower-class workers? Under that
system, not only do massive amounts
of other people’s money flow here to
Washington, but so does the decision-
making capacity, over large swaths of
people’s lives, from your healthcare de-
cisions to how you power your home, or
your car, or what school your child can
attend.
Liberal Democrats often mock Re-
publican economic policies as trickle-
down economics. But the socialist view
essentially constitutes trickle-down
bureaucracy. The theory is that if we
give more money and power to Federal
bureaucrats in Washington, that the
benefits will somehow trickle down to
those who need it the most.
Furthermore, it is fundamentally im-
moral for decisions over your life to be
fundamentally outsourced to a far dis-
tant Capital hundreds or thousands of
miles away with the dim promise of
support after the Washington swamp
has had its say.
The best way to combat the rise of
socialism is to educate Americans on
the devastation that it has caused in
other countries around the world.
In Greece, socialist policies have
crippled investment, innovation, entre-
preneurship, and led to a shortage of
food, money, and medicine.
In Venezuela, the socialist policies of
Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro have
led to mass shortages of critical medi-
cine, widespread starvation, sky-
rocketing crime, and a terrible refugee
crisis.
In contrast, countries that have
adopted the capitalist principles of eco-
nomic freedom have fared much better.
After trying Socialist policies in the
20th century, Israel, India, and the
United Kingdom realized that their
economies were hopelessly stagnated,
and as a result, all three countries
stopped allowing the government to
dictate economic decisions and made
the switch to free-market policies as a
way to jump-start their economies.
After embracing economic freedom,
India now has the largest middle class
in the free world. Israel is rated as the
third most innovative economy in the
world, and the United Kingdom’s econ-
omy grew faster than nearly every
other economy in Europe.
As a strong supporter of economic
freedom, I stand firm in my commit-
ment to combat the rise of socialism.
This dangerous ideology has failed in
nearly every country where it has been
tried, and we must do everything in
our power to educate the next genera-
tion of Americans about the true na-
ture of socialism.
Socialism is not what made America
great. Socialism is not who we are.
America will never become a Socialist
Nation.

WE HEAR AMERICANS REGARDING
SKYROCKETING DRUG COSTS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. TRONE) for 5 minutes.
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in support of H.R. 3, the Elijah
Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.
This bill fulfills a promise that we
made to the American people.
We heard America when you told us
drug costs were so high you sometimes
had to choose between buying your
medicine and paying your heating bill.
We heard America when you spoke to
us about skyrocketing drug costs com-
promising your quality of life.
We heard America when you said you
had to ration drugs because you
couldn’t afford your next prescription.
No one should have to make those
tradeoffs for themselves or their chil-
dren.
In the United States, we pay more for
drugs than any other country. For in-
sulin alone, Americans pay four times
the average of other countries. In my
district in Maryland, people with Medi-
care are paying 4.9 times what they
would pay in Australia; 3.5 times what
they would pay in the United Kingdom;
and 2.6 times what they would pay in
Canada for prescription drugs.
Marylanders and Americans have
been getting a bad deal, and it is time
to change that. I come from the busi-
ness world and in business you are suc-
cessful when you negotiate a better
price. Government should be able to do
the same thing with pharmaceutical
companies.
H.R. 3 will allow us to do this. It will
allow the U.S. Government to nego-
tiate lower prices for Medicare and pri-
vate insurance and put a $2,000 out-of-
pocket limit on prescription drugs. It
will also expand Medicare benefits to
add coverage for dental, vision, and
hearing for the first time ever.
In total, this bill will save the Fed-
eral Government over $500 billion over
the next 10 years. Not only will this
save money in the pockets of the aver-
age American, but it will reinvest that
money to help our children and our
children’s children.
It will do this by investing $10 billion
for biomedical research at NIH. NIH is
the best investment in our future that
we could ever make. Every dollar spurs
$8 in return. Investing money in NIH
just makes sense.
It will also do this by investing $10
billion to fight our Nation’s biggest
problem: the opioid epidemic. Unscru-
pulous pharma companies fueled this
opioid epidemic with irresponsible and
illegal schemes to flood the market
with prescription pain pills. We have
paid dearly for those pills in lives lost.
It is only right that the savings we
create through lowering drug prices for
Americans should go to fighting this
epidemic.
I am proud that the bipartisan bill I
introduced with the Freshmen Working
Group on Addiction, the State Opioid
Response Grant Authorization Act, is
included in H.R. 3 and will provide $7.5
billion over the next 5 years for con-
sistent and predictable funding for the
communities that are fighting the
opioid epidemic on the front lines.
Opioids have killed more than 400,000
Americans. It is time to act.
Last month, I held a roundtable in
Gaithersburg, Maryland, about the
high cost of prescription drugs. At the
roundtable, we had medical profes-
sionals and regular folks who wrote
into my office about the incredibly
high cost of prescription drugs.
One of those people was Suzette Cum-
berland. Suzette has Type 1 diabetes,
and over the summer the price for her
medication shot up 300 percent without
warning or explanation. This is not
fair, and it is not right.
I am standing on the floor of the
House of Representatives today and
say to Suzette: We all hear you. I hear
you and the millions of people across
the country who have to make deci-
sions about whether to pay for food or
the medication they need to survive.
I urge my colleagues to vote for the
Elijah Cummings Lower Drug Costs
Now Act. It is time to stand up to the
pharmaceutical companies and fight
for those without a PAC or a lobbyist
to represent them—the American peo-
ple.
Let’s fight for them.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.

yards wide. Coach Trimble was the
most successful high school coach in
Oklahoma history with 13 State cham-
pionships, and in 2017, Jenks High
School affectionately renamed their
stadium the ‘‘Allan Trimble Stadium’’
in his honor.
He was inducted into the Oklahoma
Sports Hall of Fame in 2018. Trimble
believed that when you make better
people, you make better players. For
Coach Trimble, winning on the field
was a by-product of winning off the
field, keeping your priorities of faith,
family, and football, in that order.
Coach Trimble was a master mentor
who spent his entire adult life pouring
his wisdom into high school students
and young adults. Countless people
were blessed by his mentorship.
Despite his battle with ALS, Coach
Trimble continued to believe that he
was blessed and needed to bless others.
Coach Trimble spent his last year de-
veloping the Trimble Strong Founda-
tion, a continuation of his efforts to
serve others and mentor the next gen-
eration.
Last week, Coach Trimble left this
earthly pain to join our Father in
Heaven.
He is remembered a hero by thou-
sands of lives he touched both on and
off the football field. Oklahoma will
never forget his legacy of service and of
selflessness, faith, and football.

CONGRATULATING STATE FOOTBALL CHAMPIONS
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today in honor of three
high school football teams in my dis-
trict who won statewide football State
championships this weekend.
In 6A Division I, Owasso High School,
coached by Bill Blankenship, had an
impeccable and undefeated season,
earning their second State champion-
ship in 3 years.
In 6A Division II, Bixby High School,
coached by Loren Montgomery, cruised
to an undefeated season as well, win-
ning State for the fifth time in 6 years.
In 3A, Lincoln Christian School,
coached by Jerry Ricke, also went
undefeated this year. They sailed
through the playoffs to a victory in the
State finals on Saturday.
Congratulations to the Rams, the
Spartans, and the Bulldogs. These
players and coaches worked hard all
year to earn these championships.
In addition to these championship
teams, Oklahoma’s First District had
several teams make it to the finals.
Jenks High School took runner-up in
6A Division I. Metro Christian School
is playing in this weekend’s 2A cham-
pionship game. And Regent Prep is
playing for the Class B championship.
With so many exceptional teams, Fri-

f
HONORING LIFE AND LEGACY OF
JAKE BURTON CARPENTER
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Vermont (Mr. WELCH) for 5 minutes.
Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, on Novem-
ber 20, 2019, only 3 weeks ago, Vermont
lost a great Vermonter and an inspir-
ing American, Jake Burton Carpenter,
the person who started Burton
Snowboards, the person who actually
created the whole sport of boarding.
Jake was a great Vermonter and pio-
neer of snowboarding. He was a great
husband to his wife, best friend, and
business partner for decades, Donna
Carpenter, and the proud father of
George, Taylor, and Timi,
snowboarders or riders all.
Jake’s life was one of great effort, in-
spiring originality, perpetual decency,
and deep love of the snowboarding
sport Jake created, deep love of the
people who came to the sport, and deep
love of his community and all the peo-
ple who worked in his company.
Snowboarding in 2019 is a wildly pop-
ular sport that Jake started. It has a
prominent place in our Winter Olympic
Games, and it has extraordinary cham-
pions. It was once shunned and prohib-
ited in all our ski areas.
Mr. Speaker, you couldn’t bring a
board to a mountain, and it was be-
cause the kids who wanted to do this
were rambunctious, energetic, and
Jake would sometimes say disrespect-
ful of their elders. But they loved to
ride, loved to be outdoors, and loved to
be with each other. It was this culture
of community that Jake created as
much as this extraordinary sport that
allowed people to demonstrate amazing
physical skills.
He started this company in Stratton,
Vermont. He worked as a bartender at
night. During the day, he worked not
in his garage but in a barn at a house
where he was housesitting. By himself,
he was making these snowboards.
This is one of his early Burton
Snowboards.
With Donna, whom he met in 1982 and
married in 1983, he then started pro-
moting to ski areas to let these ram-
bunctious kids ride. Ski area after ski
area relented and ultimately came to
see riding as the economic future of
their mountains because as ski trips
have gone down, boarding has gone up.
The company that Jake left behind
that he started out of nothing now has
about 32 percent of the sales in this
huge market, about $400 million. It is
over a $1 billion industry. It has over
1,000 employees in six different coun-
tries.
Riding today is something you do if
you dare. It wasn’t always so. When
Jake started in 1977, he started from
nothing, but he loved it.
After he graduated from NYU in 1977
and a short stint on Wall Street, the
last time I think Jake ever wore a suit,
he went to pursue his dream in
Vermont. He marketed this board ini-
tially to 22-year-olds. Then he realized
that when he was a kid, the first time
that he got on something that was the
predecessor to these beautiful Burton
Snowboards, it was two skis bound to-
gether with a rope at the top called a
Snurfer, and he was 15 or 16. He started
marketing to even younger kids. They
went outside, got on the mountain, and
then a sport was born.
Mr. Speaker, so many champions
have been folks who rode these boards
in their glory. One of them, of course,
was Shaun ‘‘The Flying Tomato’’
White. The Flying Tomato got so many
awards that he has become one of our
greatest Olympic champions.
Now, Jake’s life was not without real
suffering. He lost his beloved brother,
George, in the Vietnam war. His mom,
Kitty, died when he was 17.
I want to end with Jake’s words:
‘‘The riders, the product, the process,
this is my heart and soul. I just love
the freedom snowboarding gives you to
do whatever you want.’’

USMCA WILL CREATE JOBS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Kentucky (Mr. COMER) for 5 minutes.
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to commend President Trump for
the recent bipartisan deal with Con-
gress to replace NAFTA with a new and
significantly improved free trade
agreement, the USMCA.
This deal will create jobs, boost our
agriculture exports, and grow the econ-
omy in Kentucky. It is good for our
farmers and manufacturers, and it will
benefit all Americans.
The USMCA also encourages innova-
tion, opens new markets for our farm-
ers, and strengthens enforcement and
accountability with our trading part-
ners in the global economy.
Unfortunately, it took far too long
for Speaker PELOSI and the House
Democrats to come to the table and
move toward action on an important
priority to the American people. Their
excessive, unfounded focus on impeach-
ing the President has created months
of needless delay on a vote on the
USMCA, a vote we continue to await.
However, it is good news that a deal
has finally been reached. It is one that
will provide our economy with in-
creased stability and confidence. But
now that we finally have an agreement
on a deal negotiated by the President
over a year ago, Democratic leadership
must act quickly and bring the USMCA
to the floor for a vote. My constituents
and all Americans deserve no less than
a government that works for them
rather than one that plays political
games with our economy.
The need for a modern agreement
with our major trading partners has
been neglected for long enough. We
must now do our duty and take a vote
on the USMCA, which will help us re-
main competitive in the 21st century
economy.

SUPPORT IMMIGRATION REFORM
FOR FARMWORKERS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes.
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to support the Farm Workforce Mod-
ernization Act.
Let me first thank Chairperson ZOE
LOFGREN and Ranking Member DAN
NEWHOUSE for their hard work in form-
ing this bipartisan compromise.
Farmworkers are some of the hardest
working individuals you will ever
meet. I know. As a farmer’s son, I have
done that work. It is hard, but it is
skilled work. It is simply wrong that
they are subject to living and working
in the shadow of uncertainty and fear
of deportation.
Just last month in the city of Madera
in my district, I met with members of
the United Farm Workers organization
to tell them of the promise of this bill.
I spoke with these hardworking men
and women and their young children
who work to put food on America’s din-
ner table every night.
I could see the hope in their eyes,
hope for a normal life free from the
dread of possible family separation and
deportation that hangs over them
every day when they leave to go work
and hope for a chance to change their
reality and reshape their story.
We owe it to these individuals who do
so much for us. This monumental, bi-
partisan compromise is a unique oppor-
tunity to provide us with the first
meaningful reform in the immigration
system in over four decades.
Many of us would like comprehensive
immigration reform for our Dreamers
and to fix our broken immigration sys-
tem. For now, that is not possible, but
this legislation that would provide
legal status for seasonal and year-
round farmworkers is.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
stand with me and support the Farm
Workforce Modernization Act that we
will vote on later today.
LOWER DRUG COSTS NOW
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I also rise
to support the Elijah E. Cummings
Lower Drug Costs Now Act.
Americans want Congress to tackle
issues that they care most about, and
spiraling drug costs is one of the most
important issues.
Passing H.R. 3, the Elijah E.
Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act,
will help lower prescription drug prices
and hold drug companies accountable
for unfair price hikes.
Prescription drugs in the United
States we all know are four times high-
er than what they charge for the same
drugs in many other countries. The
soaring cost of insulin is one example
of the way we see gouging, quadrupling
over the last decade.
b 1100
Diabetes is an epidemic in our coun-
try, affecting over 30 million people in
the United States and costing Ameri-
cans more than $100 billion a year to
manage.
In Fresno County, one of the counties
I represent in my district in the San
Joaquin Valley, it is estimated 68 per-
cent of the adults between the ages of
55 and 69 have diabetes.
These Americans need insulin to
manage their condition, but these high
prices are causing them impossible
choices. The question is: Do they pay
for medication or do they put food on
their dinner table, making sacrifices
that are simply unacceptable?
Democrats are committed to putting
the healthcare of American people first
and stopping this unfair practice. So
far this year, we have sent multiple
bills to the Senate to reduce healthcare
and prescription drug costs. Silence.
Silence is the only answer we get from
the Senate.
Tomorrow, we will pass another bill,
H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act,
and this aims to stop drug companies
from gaming the system unfairly and
raising prices on American families.
That is what we are trying to do.
This bill also builds on the Affordable
Healthcare Act by adding $10 billion a
year for expanding community health
centers, which have been instrumental
in my area and throughout the country
in increasing healthcare and access to
healthcare in rural America.
In my district, 400,000 people would
benefit if we passed H.R. 3 and it is
signed into law. My constituents who
rely on prescription drugs are depend-
ing on us to act to ensure that medica-
tions are affordable, and I intend to do
that by voting to support this legisla-
tion.
It will also save Americans over $500
billion over the next 10 years.
So now is the time to act, and it is
the time for the Senate to do their job.
IN HONOR OF CORPORAL,
RETIRED, MATTHEW BRADFORD
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
RUSH). The Chair recognizes the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) for 5
minutes.
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to honor the life of a unique and spe-
cial man and my good friend, U.S. Ma-
rine Corporal, Retired, Matthew Brad-
ford. Matthew is stepping down as vet-
erans outreach coordinator in my dis-
trict office.
Matthew, who grew up in our district
in Winchester, Kentucky, enlisted in
the United States Marine Corps when
he graduated from high school, and he
was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd
Marines, Echo Company, 2nd Platoon.
He was deployed to Iraq in 2006, and
on January 18, 2007, he suffered cata-
strophic injuries as a result of the det-
onation of an improvised explosive de-
vice. His severe injuries left him to-
tally blind, and he lost both of his legs.
Matthew persevered, and he learned
to overcome and adapt from his inju-
ries. In 2010, Matthew became the first
blind double amputee in history to re-
enlist in the Marine Corps.
On behalf of a grateful nation, I
thank him for his service, his sacrifice,
and his patriotism.
Matthew Bradford is a very deter-
mined individual. After his service
with the Marine Corps ended, he mar-
ried his ‘‘Warrior Princess,’’ Amanda.
Together, they have three children.
Through hard work and determina-
tion, Matthew graduated from the Uni-
versity of Kentucky.
Matthew found his purpose in moti-
vating and encouraging others to over-
come difficult obstacles. He spends a
great deal of his time speaking to
groups and individuals and partici-
pating in challenging athletic events,
including marathons, skydiving, surf-
ing, hunting, and climbing 7,000 feet up
Mount Rainier.
Matthew came to work in the Sixth
Congressional District office in the
spring of 2017, serving first as a college
intern, then as my national security
fellow, and, lastly, as our veterans out-
reach coordinator.
In his work in our district office,
Matthew has been a strong advocate
for veterans. He worked with our vet-
erans coalition, and it has grown tre-
mendously under his leadership.
Matthew has worked on many out-
reach initiatives, including our
Facebook page, and has worked dili-
gently to improve the lives of Amer-
ica’s veterans. His work with veterans
has made quite a difference.
His passion, his humor, and his deter-
mination will be greatly missed in our
office, but his life’s work in service to
his community and the Nation will
surely continue.
Matthew has earned many honors, in-
cluding the Purple Heart medal, the
George Van Cleve Military Leadership
Award, the Gary Sinise Hope for the
Warriors Award, and induction into the
Kentucky Veterans Hall of Fame. He

Mr. Speaker, I thank Corporal Brad-
ford for his friendship, for his tireless

Sixth District, and his outstanding
service to the country.
TWO-STATE SOLUTION
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to acknowledge the United States most
important strategic ally in the Middle
East, the nation of Israel.
Last week, the House voted on and
nearly passed, along mostly partisan
lines, a nonbinding resolution rein-
forcing the failed two-state policy that
has been pushed on both the Israeli and
Palestinian people since the signing of
the failed Oslo Accords. I opposed that
resolution.
The truth is we need a new way of
thinking about the path toward a last-
ing peace between Arabs and Jews in
the Middle East. The idea that politi-
cians from outside of Israel can impose
a top-down forced division of Arabs and
Israelis is nonsense.
Rhetoric about a negotiated two-
state resolution is not credible when it
is promoted by those who criticize
Israel’s settlements within the Biblical
homeland of the Jewish people. Current
Israeli settlements established through
peaceful means extend the reach of
freedom and democracy, while the pro-
posed ejection of Jews from settle-
ments has a record incongruent with
peace.
The 2005 Israeli withdrawal from
Gaza has been a disaster for Palestin-
ians, allowing terrorist groups like
Hamas and PIJ to take over and ter-
rorize that strip of land and its citi-
zens.
I have personally been to Judea and
Samaria, and I have witnessed Jews
and Arabs working together, side by
side, in private enterprise, seeing that
peace is possible.
When stability exists under the rule
of law, under the freedom and security
offered by the State of Israel, busi-
nesses thrive, families earn a living,
and freedom and democracy expand—
all things that I encourage my col-
leagues to consider.

Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise

A San Diego native, Lieutenant
Wilkie worked diligently as both a stu-
dent and as a member of his commu-
nity, and his accomplishments earned
him a spot at the prestigious Air Force
Academy in Colorado Springs.
On November 21 of this year, Lieu-
tenant Wilkie was training with a fel-
low pilot, Lieutenant Colonel John
Kinkade, when Travis’ plane crashed
during a landing formation. Both Lieu-
tenant Wilkie and Colonel Kinkade
tragically lost their lives that day.
Lieutenant Wilkie’s loss is felt in our
community in San Diego, by his col-
leagues at the Air Force Academy, by
his fellow servicemembers at Vance Air
Force Base, and by his family. In a text
to me yesterday, his mom, Carlene,
said: ‘‘ ‘Devastated’ is not a strong
enough word. Travis was a brilliant,
hardworking 23-year-old who just mar-
ried the love of his life on October 14.
I don’t believe any young pilot should
die in a training mission. Unbearable.’’
Please join me in remembering and
honoring Second Lieutenant Wilkie
and Lieutenant Colonel Kinkade, their
families, and the communities they
touched during their lives and their
service.
IN HONOR OF ALBERT J. HICKMAN
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the San Diego hero,
the late Ensign Albert J. Hickman, a
decorated veteran who gave his life to
save many others.
Ensign Hickman was 21 years old
when the F3H Demon, the jet he was
piloting, malfunctioned. He was on a
routine training mission over San
Diego, California, when he lost control
of the aircraft and began plummeting
toward the ground.
At the time of the engine malfunc-
tion, Hickman’s jet was directly over a
neighborhood and an elementary
school playground crowded with chil-
dren on their noontime recess. Instead
of simply ejecting from the jet, he
stayed with the aircraft and steered it
into a remote canyon in order to avoid
the playground.
Ensign Hickman sacrificed his life to
save the lives of 750 children. He was
posthumously awarded the Navy and
Marine Corps Medal, the highest non-
combat medal awarded for heroism.
Hickman Elementary School in Mira
Mesa was also named in his honor, as
was Hickman Field in Kearny Mesa.
At a ceremony at the school, 11-year-
old Hawthorne student body president
Kay Schade gave a speech that was
quoted in the San Diego Union Trib-
une: ‘‘Ensign Hickman not only saved
our lives but left us an ideal by which
to live. Let us strive to be as brave and
courageous ourselves as he was.’’
December 4 marked the 60th anniver-
sary of his death. In September, his
heroism was remembered at Mount
Soledad Veterans Memorial.
Please join me in honoring Ensign
Albert Hickman for his dedication and
sacrifice as we seek to continue his leg-
acy of heroism.
IN HONOR OF SENIOR CHIEF PETTY OFFICER
KENTON STACY
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Senior Chief Petty
Officer Kenton Stacy, a decorated vet-
eran who sustained injuries in the line
of duty while on tour in Syria.
Senior Chief Stacy was on his final
tour in Syria after having already com-
pleted one tour in Iraq and two in Af-
ghanistan. He specialized in explosive
ordnance disposal, meaning that every
assignment he undertook was a matter
of life and death for himself and mem-
bers of his team.
In 2017, Senior Chief Stacy and his
unit were clearing a hospital in an area
that had been recently occupied by
ISIS. During their mission, an explo-
sive device detonated, leaving Senior
Chief Stacy badly wounded. While Sen-
ior Chief Stacy survived, the explosion
ultimately left him paralyzed and un-
able to speak.
Senior Chief Stacy was honored this
past Veterans Day with a plaque at the
Mount Soledad Veterans Memorial in
San Diego, the only memorial in the
United States that honors veterans,
both living and deceased, from the Rev-
olutionary War until now. This will
help ensure that his sacrifice is never
forgotten.
Please join me in honoring Senior
Chief Petty Officer Kent Stacy and his
family and thanking them for all their
courage and service to our country.

SOCIALIZED MEDICINE IS DEADLY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Alabama (Mr. BROOKS) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, 106—nearly half—of House Demo-
crats have cosponsored the socialists’
Lower Drug Costs Now Act.
I will not mince words: Socialized
medicine causes worse healthcare at
higher costs with longer waits and
more dead Americans.
America must learn from countries
that have experimented with socialized
medicine. Per Britain’s Royal College
of Surgeons, almost a quarter of a mil-
lion people must wait more than 6
months—6 months—to receive planned
medical treatment from the National
Health Service. Worse yet, more than
3,600 Britons wait more than 9 months
for medical care.
The photo next to me was taken by a
British mother outraged by the
healthcare her ill son received. As this
photo shows, her son was treated on a
hospital floor.
Do we want newborn babies kept in
cardboard boxes like they are in social-
ist Venezuela? Is that really what we
want in America?
I say no. But that is exactly what
America will get if socialists have
their way in this healthcare debate.
Canada’s socialized medicine is no
better. A 2016 survey by Canada’s Fra-
ser Institute found a median wait of 20

weeks, almost 5 months, for ‘‘medically
necessary’’ treatments and procedures.
Britain’s National Health Service
data reveals that almost 25 percent of
cancer patients don’t start treatment
on time, despite urgent referrals from
their primary care doctors. Britain’s
politicians whitewash this deadly sta-
tistic by claiming treatment is ‘‘on
time,’’ if it is given within 62 days of
referral—2 months of referral.
Such long wait periods for cancer
treatment can be, and are, deadly. For
example, 81 percent of British breast
cancer patients live 5 years after diag-
nosis compared to 89 percent for Amer-
ican breast cancer patients. Stated dif-
ferently, 8 of every 100 breast cancer
patients who live in America would die
in Britain’s socialized medicine sys-
tem.
Americans with prostate cancer have
a 97 percent 5-year survival rate. In
Britain, it drops to 83 percent. Stated
differently, 14 of every 100 prostate
cancer patients who live in America
would die in Britain’s socialized medi-
cine system.
It is irresponsible and dangerous for
America to copy socialized medicine,
yet that is exactly what socialist
Democrats wants us to do.
The House soon votes on a socialist
drug cost plan that gives the govern-
ment control over drug pricing while
suppressing the invention of lifesaving
drugs. For example, the Congressional
Budget Office warns this legislation re-
sults in 15 fewer drugs in the next 10
years. That is 15 drugs that help Amer-
icans live longer or more comfortably,
gone, because of socialist Democrat
wishful thinking.
b 1115
Mr. Speaker, socialized medicine is
not the answer. Government price con-
trols are not the answer.
The answer is more free enterprise
competition that forces healthcare pro-
viders and drug companies to provide
their best products at their lowest
prices or go out of business.
I urge the American people to not
fall prey to socialists who promise tax-
payer-funded government healthcare.
I urge my colleagues to vote against
this socialist drug pricing scheme.
Most importantly, I urge America to
be wary of propaganda that claims so-
cialized medicine lowers healthcare
costs or saves lives. Socialized medi-
cine does neither.
Remember that promise that
ObamaCare will cut your health insur-
ance premiums by $2,500 per year? That
was false propaganda.
Remember the promise that, under
ObamaCare you can keep your doctor
and health insurance plans if you want
them? That was more false propaganda.
America, do your homework. Don’t
fall for the lies again. Demand solu-
tions that both lower costs and save
lives.
Why? Because your very life is at
risk.
THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Florida (Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL) for 5
minutes.
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Mr.
Speaker, the number one concern that
I continue to hear from my constitu-
ents is the high cost of healthcare, es-
pecially the skyrocketing prices of pre-
scription drugs.
From Kendall to Key West, I have
heard stories of patients that are
forced to choose between putting food
on the table or paying for lifesaving
drugs. Meanwhile, Big Pharma con-
tinues to collect hundreds of billions of
dollars in profits each year.
This cannot continue. We must pass
H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower
Drug Costs Now Act of 2019, which will
save Floridians thousands in drug costs
each year.
This bill would cut Medicare spend-
ing by over $400 billion, and reinvest
these savings to combat the opioid epi-
demic, fund research for new
groundbreaking cures; it would expand
Medicare benefits, and it would also be
used to strengthen community health
centers.
As the past Dean of the Medical
School at Florida International Uni-
versity, I have worked directly with
these centers and I have seen firsthand
the impact that they have had on our
community.
In my district, Community Health of
South Florida, or CHI, plays a crucial
role in providing care to the uninsured
and underinsured.
In 2018 alone, CHI provided care for
over 82,000 patients, including primary
care services, behavioral health, OB/
GYN procedures, and free HIV
screenings.
These health centers serve everyone
in the community, regardless of their
ability to pay. They expand quality, af-
fordable healthcare for everyone.
The time to act is now. We have to
pass H.R. 3 to lower prescription drug
prices and strengthen the healthcare
centers that thousands in my district
depend on for care.
f
LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG
PRICES NOW
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, every
day I hear from my constituents in
Pennsylvania’s Ninth Congressional
District about the skyrocketing costs
of prescription drugs. Families should
not have to dedicate such a high per-
centage of their disposable income on
prescription drugs, and families should
certainly not be forced to choose be-
tween buying medication or putting
food on their table.
Over 70 percent of Americans think
that lowering prescription drugs prices
should be a top priority for Congress.
Delivering for the American people will
require a bipartisan approach with pro-
posals that can actually pass the House
and the Senate and be signed into law.
Unfortunately, Speaker PELOSI’s pre-
scription drug pricing proposal, H.R. 3,
was crafted without any Republican
input and will be dead on arrival in the
Senate.
A key component of H.R. 3 involves
the Federal Government mandating
pricing for prescription drugs. While
supporters of H.R. 3 describe this as
‘‘voluntary negotiation,’’ manufactur-
ers who decline to participate in the
process are taxed up to 95 percent of
the medicine’s gross sales. That is 95
percent of the gross sales price.
This is not a negotiation. This is a
heavyhanded government at its worst.
It is ridiculous. It is take this price or
else. It is, figuratively and literally, a
poison pill provision to this bill.
Government, command central price
setting is not only un-American, it is
ineffective. When we look at countries
with heavyhanded approaches to price
controls, we find they have signifi-
cantly less access to lifesaving medica-
tions and treatments.
Of the 270 new medicines available in
the United States, only 41 percent are
available in Australia; 52 percent in
Canada; 53 percent in France; 67 per-
cent in Germany; 48 percent in Japan;
64 percent in the United Kingdom.
Imagine, in our country, a lifesaving
drug being available in another coun-
try but not available here. We can’t
imagine that.
Fortunately, House Republicans have
found a solution to lowering prescrip-
tion drug prices without sacrificing
American innovation or harming ac-
cess to lifesaving medications.
H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures
Act, is a package of over 40 bipartisan
provisions to lower out-of-pocket
spending, strengthen transparency, and
spur competition.
H.R. 19 protects seniors by placing an
annual cap on out-of-pocket drug costs
and establishing a ‘‘smoothing’’ mecha-
nism to allow them to distribute their
prescription drug spending throughout
the year. Rather than heavyhanded
government overreach, H.R. 19 stimu-
lates free market forces to spur innova-
tion and lower costs by streamlining
FDA approval pipelines, increasing
availability of over-the-counter prod-
ucts, and prohibiting anticompetitive
practices that prevent access to
generics.
H.R. 19 makes insulin more afford-
able—so important—by capping the
costs at $50 a month after a Medicare
beneficiary has met their deductible.
Under H.R. 19, doctors would know
what a patient will have to pay for a
drug, allowing them to prescribe medi-
cation that addresses the patient’s
needs and fits their budget.
Again, every single provision in H.R.
19 is bipartisan and could actually be-
come law. President Trump has made
it abundantly clear that lowering pre-
scription drug prices is a top priority,

f
MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT DO YOU
HAVE TO HIDE?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR) for 5 minutes.
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, yester-
day, Russian dictator Vladimir Putin
must have been consumed with delight.
President Trump chose to invite to the
White House Russian Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov, the right arm of Vladi-
mir Putin.
The American people should be on
red alert, asking themselves what the
President has to discuss with a senior
leader of an adversary, in a meeting
closed to the press and closed to the
American people.
Mr. President, what do you have to
hide?
Importantly, Mr. Lavrov is the indi-
vidual that first concocted the Ukraine
false narrative on December 1, 2016,
that hid Russia’s involvement in our
elections, blaming it on Ukraine.
It seems that this meeting is a part
of a pattern of President Trump’s dis-
turbing behavior to cozy up to dictator
Putin and his oligarch cronies, many of
whom have invested heavily in Trump
properties.
Astoundingly, President Trump wel-
comed Russia’s intervention in our 2016
elections, and then he invited Russia
back to the Group of Seven.
He shamelessly kowtowed to Putin at
the Helsinki Summit.
And additionally, President Trump
withheld critical military assistance
and a White House meeting from the
President of Ukraine, Volodymyr
Zelensky, urging him to investigate
false conspiracy theories about Presi-
dent Trump’s political opponents here
at home.
Meanwhile, the President publicly
and continuously derides our closest
allies, and questions the value of
NATO, for heaven’s sake, the North At-
lantic Treaty Organization, the bul-
wark of our security as free people.
And he embraces dictators from around
the world.
Yet, again, need I remind the Presi-
dent that Russia seeks to destroy lib-
erty. Putin seeks to destroy critical
democratic alliances, forged at great
sacrifice, such as NATO, that have
brought unprecedented peace, security,
and prosperity to the free world, which
includes us.
In 2019, Russia illegally invaded the
independent nation of Ukraine, leading
to already over 14,000 deaths and the
displacement of millions. Ukraine is
the scrimmage line for liberty in the
Transatlantic Alliance. Russia has
been working hard to destroy that alli-
ance, which is freedom’s bulwark.
Russia has sided with the barbarous
Assad regime in Syria, and Russia con-
ducts constant cyberattacks and misin-
formation campaigns to meddle in
democratic processes, including here in
our 2016 presidential election; and she
is intent to do it again next year.
Simply put, the enemy of liberty will
stop at nothing to weaken the United
States and our allies.
When the American people elect
their President, they expect a leader to
champion liberty on the world stage.
The world is watching, and so are our
children. How should they interpret
the United States rolling out the White
House red carpet for corrupt Russian
leaders, while freedom-seeking Ukrain-
ian President Zelensky is still waiting
for his invitation to the White House?
Indeed, this Lavrov meeting is rather
sinister. It comes at a very sensitive
time, domestically and internation-
ally. On the eve of the meeting with
Mr. Lavrov, Mr. Trump continues to
deride our own national security insti-
tutions, such as the FBI, whose inves-
tigation clearly proved Russia inter-
fered with our 2016 election, and she is
on task to do it again.
Mr. Lavrov, himself, invented and di-
rected the totally false narrative that
Ukraine interfered in our election, a
conspiracy theory spun up by the
enemy of democracy himself. By siding
with Russia, our President’s behavior
encourages Russia’s malign behavior,
while hurting our allies.
Interestingly, this secretive meeting
in the Oval Office comes right after the
Normandy Format talks in France be-
tween Ukraine, Germany, France, and
Russia, when President Zelensky suc-
cessfully withstood Russian pressure.
He did not cross any red lines that
could suggest capitulation of Ukraine
in front of Russian aggression.
And during the Normandy meetings,
thousands of freedom-loving Ukrain-
ians showed up on the streets of Kyiv
to show their support for President
Zelensky and their readiness to defend
their beloved motherland.
So, our conclusion is what Russia
couldn’t achieve through the open
channel of diplomacy, it tries to do
through the channels behind closed
doors here in our own backyard.
Congress must demand full access to
the transcript of the meeting between
the President of our country and the
Foreign Minister of Russia Lavrov.
Free people deserve it.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.

INCENTIVIZE BUSINESS TO HIRE
VETERANS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. WRIGHT) for 5 minutes.
Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I am
proud to introduce the Veterans Back
to Work Act of 2019.
It is not hard to see that our econ-
omy is booming. We have the lowest
unemployment rate in 50 years, and
hourly wages continue to rise.
Despite the record-breaking eco-
nomic numbers we continue to see
every month, 326,000 veterans remain
unemployed around the country. We
should be doing everything we can to
facilitate veterans’ transitions back
into the civilian workforce to help fill
the over 7 million open jobs we have
here in the United States.
The Veterans Back to Work Act
would make the work opportunity tax
credit, which is set to expire at the end
of the year, permanent. This tax credit
is issued to businesses and nonprofits
that hire individuals who consistently
face significant barriers that prevent
them from obtaining employment.
Making the work opportunity tax
credit permanent is a great way to en-
sure our veterans are set up for suc-
cess. There is no reason not to
incentivize businesses to fill jobs with
the men and women who have served
and sacrificed so much for our Nation.
I urge my colleagues from both sides
of the aisle to come together and sup-
port this critical legislation.
RECOGNIZING BILL ZEDLER
Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, a lion of
the Legislature in Texas is serving his
last term in office.
Since 2003, State Representative Bill
Zedler has been a champion of liberty,
a champion of free enterprise, a cham-
pion of religious freedom, a champion
for life. He has been a champion like
few others in the Texas Legislature.
Whether the issue was taxes, edu-
cation, healthcare, veterans benefits,
whatever it was, his was a voice to
which others listened because that
voice has always been a voice of truth
and wisdom. That voice will be greatly
missed.
All of us in public office at the end of
our time of service have to answer the
question, did we leave things better
than we found them? For my friend
Bill Zedler, that answer is a resounding
yes because Texas today is better be-
cause State Representative Bill Zedler
served in the Texas Legislature.
At the end of the movie ‘‘Troy,’’
Odysseus is commenting about how
history will be written. He says that he
lived among giants, that he wanted it
to be said that he lived in the time of
Hector, that he lived in the time of
Achilles. Well, members of the Texas
Legislature can be proud that they
served in the time of Bill Zedler.
I thank Bill for all of his magnificent
service to the Texas Legislature.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10029
December 11, 2019
Reverend Evans was the inspirational
icon and tireless servant to his church,
to his community, and to the people of
Chicago and borders beyond. His un-
timely passing has left us all with yet
another stunning and unimaginable
loss.
Born in Brownsville, Tennessee, Rev-
erend Evans founded the Fellowship
Missionary Baptist Church in 1950. For
the next 70 years, he would nourish and
strengthen the souls of his flock with
his unwavering wisdom, his incorrupt-
ible courage, and his unyielding devo-
tion to the Word of the Lord, the Good
News, the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The
Bible, Madam Speaker, says at Psalms
119:105: ‘‘Your word is a lamp to my
feet and a light to my path.’’
Reverend Evans lived his faith hum-
bly. He was a prophet to both parish-
ioners and pastors alike. When the
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King
brought his movement to Chicago, Rev-
erend Evans had the courage to wel-
come Dr. King into his church against
the objections and the retribution of
then-Mayor Richard J. Daley and many
others.
Reverend Evans was instrumental in
founding the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition
alongside the Reverend Jesse Louis
Jackson, Sr. As chairman of the board
of PUSH from 1970 to 1976, Reverend
Evans worked diligently to establish
Rainbow/PUSH as a national power-
house in the fight for civil rights.
Madam Speaker, Reverend Evans
leaves behind a long legacy of pastors
who greatly benefited from his teach-
ings, including Reverend Jesse Jack-
son, Sr. and Mother Consuella York,
the first Chicago woman to be ordained
in the Baptist denomination. In total,
Reverend Evans ordained 93 preachers
and pastors, inspiring them to go for-
ward and spread the good news of the
Gospel of Jesus Christ.
No celebration of Reverend Evans’
life would be complete without men-
tioning the innovative role music
played in his ministry. His radio broad-
cast reached far and wide into our Na-
tion, into the homes of millions of
Americans. Reverend Evans recorded 11
gospel albums and creatively infused
gospel music into his sermons, evoking
even more truth and life into the Scrip-
tures from which he was preaching.
In October 2007, Reverend Evans
graced this very Chamber with his pow-
erful presence, serving as a guest chap-
lain. It was my deep honor to sponsor
Reverend Evans. Even today, I can still
feel his presence in the same way that
I felt it all those years ago when he
took us to church here in this very
Chamber.
Madam Speaker, although we all feel
deep pain with the passing of Reverend
Evans, I am comforted in knowing that
he is now with our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ and with our Father in
Heaven.
Reverend Evans’ wife, Lutha Mae; his
daughters, Gail Claudette Pye and
Faith Evans; his sons, Michael and
Ralph; and all who loved him are in my
deepest prayers and have my greatest
sympathies as they mourn the loss of
this truly great religious giant, Rev-
erend Clay Evans.

RECOGNIZING COMPUTER SCIENCE
EDUCATION WEEK
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize Computer Science Education
Week.
Ten years ago, this awareness week
was established to highlight the impor-
tant skill set and the role it plays in
all industries.
Every year, Computer Science Edu-
cation Week serves as an opportunity
for students in kindergarten through
their senior year of high school to
learn about the importance of com-
puter science and the opportunities
that abound with a skills-based edu-
cation.
As the co-chair of the bipartisan
House Career and Technical Education
Caucus, or CTE Caucus, I am proud to
support Computer Science Education
Week.
Our Nation is facing a skilled worker
shortage. With more than 7 million
open jobs in the United States, CTE op-
portunities can offer rewarding profes-
sional futures for learners of all ages
while simultaneously closing the Na-
tion’s skills gap.
One field in particular that needs
workers trained in computer science is
cybersecurity. I was pleased to cospon-
sor H.R. 1592, the Cybersecurity Skills
Integration Act, alongside my fellow
CTE Caucus co-chair, Congressman JIM
LANGEVIN from Rhode Island. H.R. 1592
will aid in the development of a crit-
ical infrastructure workforce that is
well trained to handle cyber threats
from bad actors.
The bill authorizes $10 million to cre-
ate a competitive grant program with-
in the Department of Education to in-
corporate cybersecurity education into
new and existing CTE programs. Addi-
tionally, the bill requires the Depart-
ment of Education to coordinate with
the Department of Homeland Security
to better support cybersecurity edu-
cation programs.
A successful career in any field starts
with effective counseling. Far too
many students begin their educational
careers without fully understanding
their options, but empowering students
with counseling resources can better
prepare learners of all ages for the
workforce.
That is why Congressman LANGEVIN
and I introduced H.R. 5092, the Coun-
seling for Career Choice Act. H.R. 5092
would authorize $40 million for grants
to be used by States and local edu-
cation agencies to assess counseling
services and create new counseling
frameworks.
The bill also provides professional de-
velopment opportunities to counselors
so that they can better improve their
skills to assist their students. We need
a workforce that can meet modern
technical demands, and students who
choose a career in technical education
are best suited for that challenge.
Through career and technical edu-
cation programs like computer science,
we can begin to close our Nation’s
skills gap with helping learners of all
ages take control of their professional
futures.

RECOGNIZING KWAME ONWUACHI
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, New
York City is recognized for both its te-
nacity and its profile as an incubator
of elite talents. Perhaps no one em-
bodies these Big Apple virtues more
than chef Kwame Onwuachi, a Bronx
native.
Chef Kwame’s early life was branded
by adversity, his early career marked
by missteps. However, as a true New
Yorker and as a true son of the Bronx,
he bounced back.
A fusion of Bronx grit and culinary
acuity has catapulted this young man,
chef Kwame, from a subway candy
salesman to winning a James Beard
Award, perhaps the most prestigious
award in the culinary world.
Now, as executive chef of the re-
nowned Kith and Kin restaurant right
here in Washington, D.C., at The Wharf
here in our Nation’s Capital, chef
Kwame is a shining example of perse-
verance, prestige, and promise bred in
the Bronx.
Go try his curry goat. Go try his
oxtails. You will go back again.
Chef Kwame is an exceptional indi-
vidual, and he continues to make us all
proud. He is an inspiration to many.
He is right here with us, Mr. Speaker,
in the gallery, and I welcome him to
the House of Representatives. He is a
Bronx native and now resides here in
Washington, D.C. We are proud to have
him. He is a young talent. You will be
hearing a lot about him in the future,
not only in written media, but you will
be tasting his fine cuisine in many
places around the world.
I congratulate him for having won

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H10030 December 11, 2019
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today with sadness in my heart to
honor Officer Bill Clardy III of the
Huntsville Police Department.
Officer Clardy, a decorated 14-year
veteran of the department who also
served with distinction in the Iraq war,
was tragically shot and killed recently
during a drug investigation. Officer
Clardy was assigned to a strategic
counterdrug team called the STAC
Team, leading a task force of Federal
and local law enforcement agencies to
make drug busts across north Ala-
bama.
Sadly, the Clardy family knows well
the sacrifices of service. Officer
Clardy’s father, Billy Clardy, Jr., was
killed in a car crash while on duty in
1978.
We owe it to Officer Clardy not to
forget him or his sacrifice. Officer
Clardy’s reputation for service and for
caring for his community is un-
matched.
Officer Clardy was a Huntsville hero,
and he is an American hero. He will be
greatly missed.
Our thoughts, our prayers, and our
support now are with the Clardy fam-
ily. We embrace you with our love. We
offer you our support. In the days to
come, we pledge to you, we will not for-
get his sacrifice.

Almighty God of the universe, we
give You thanks for giving us another
day.
Lord, You are powerful and strong,
yet You bend to Your people and show
them mercy and sustaining grace.
Help the leaders of our Nation make
wise decision in our day. May they
look to You for guidance every step of
the way until we stand in Your light
forever. Set us all on a path that will
lead to peace and security.
Bless us this day and every day, and
inspire us to be grateful for the bless-
ings we enjoy and the good work that
does take place in our Nation’s Capitol.
May all that is done within the peo-
ple’s House be for Your greater honor
and glory.
Amen.

RECOGNIZING MARK COVALL
(Mr. TONKO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I rise
to recognize Mr. Mark Covall, who,
after 34 years with the National Asso-
ciation for Behavioral Healthcare, is
retiring.
For the past 24 years, as the presi-
dent and CEO of the association, Mark
has been a steadfast partner to me and
others in Congress in the fight to im-
prove our Nation’s behavioral health
system.
Under Marks’s leadership, NABH was
the leader in the fight to secure mental
health parity, paving the way for the
Paul Wellstone and Domenici Mental
Health Parity and Addiction Equity
Act.
More recently, Mark’s advocacy was
critical in the passage of CARA, the
21st Century Cures Act, and the SUP-
PORT for Patients and Communities
Act.
Mark’s leadership in coalition build-
ing as well as his work to develop
strong relationships, both in the field
and in Congress, explain why he has
been so effective during his time at
NABH.
Today, I join others in the mental
health community in thanking Mark
Covall for his decades of leadership,
dedication, and passion for ensuring
that millions of Americans have access
to quality mental health and addiction
treatment services.
We will certainly miss Mark’s con-
tributions and wish him well in his
next phase of life.
f
HONORING CHRIS BOYD AND BILL
WANDLING
(Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, today I rise to honor two Summit
County deputies who went above and
beyond their job description to rescue
an elderly couple from a house fire in
Green, Ohio.
On November 19, 2019, just before 10
p.m., Deputies Chris Boyd and Bill
Wandling were first to arrive at the
scene when they heard neighbors
yelling to alert them that 85-year-old
Caroline Knotts and her 86-year-old
husband, James, were still inside the
home engulfed in flames.
While neither Chris nor Bill are fire-
fighters, they felt compelled to help.
Without hesitation, the two deputies
rushed through the thick smoke for
nearly 10 minutes before eventually
discovering the couple and taking them
and their family dog to safety.
According to Chris and Bill, they
were just fulfilling their duty to the
citizens of Summit County; but, to me
and to everyone present that night,
these deputies demonstrated the kind-
ness, generosity, and love of neighbor
that reflects the very best of our north-
east Ohio community.
Thank you to Chris and Bill for your
dedicated service to our community.
f
HONORING DR. JIM WURGLER
(Mr. O’HALLERAN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to pay my respects to Jim
Wurgler of Williams, Arizona. Sadly,
Jim passed away last month of a
stroke.
Known to many as ‘‘Doc,’’ Jim de-
voted his life to the health and better-
ment of others. He served as an Army
physician in Vietnam and later as a
doctor in several locations throughout
the Southwest, including Grand Can-
yon Clinic and Williams Health Care
Center in my district.
A lifelong mentor to others, Jim re-
vitalized Yosemite National Park’s
EMT training program in 1978, teach-
ing advanced emergency medicine to
park rangers. One of his proudest mo-
ments was receiving an honorary park
ranger award and a new title: The
Ranger’s Doctor.
Well into retirement, Jim worked to
improve his community, going to great
lengths to recruit and retain doctors in
rural areas.
Always an optimist, Jim’s family
will be honoring his wishes and holding
a ceremony of his life in lieu of a fu-
neral.
Jim left an indelible mark on his
loved ones and on the State of Arizona.
He will not soon be forgotten. Pat and
I are keeping Jim’s family in our pray-
ers this holiday season, and I hope all
of my colleagues will do the same.

FOOD PANTRIES THIS HOLIDAY
SEASON
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, food banks and food pan-
tries play a valuable role in our com-
munities all year long, but around the
holiday season their impact on families
in need is magnified.
In 2018, more than 37 million Ameri-
cans were considered food insecure, in-
cluding 11 million children. The De-
partment of Agriculture defines food
insecurity as ‘‘a lack of consistent ac-
cess to enough food for an active,
healthy life.’’
Access to quality food and nutrition
is necessary for healthy families, and
as the former chairman of the Agri-
culture Subcommittee on Nutrition,
this is an issue that I feel very passion-
ately about.
We can all help our neighbors in need
by contributing to our local food banks
and food pantries by making a dona-
tion or volunteering our time. Just a
small contribution or a few hours out
of our day can make a big difference in
our communities.
During this holiday season, it is espe-
cially important that we support fami-
lies who have fallen on hard times.
f
WE NEED BOLD ACTION TO LOWER
THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION
DRUGS
(Mr. KIM asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. KIM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to
call for bold action to lower the cost of
prescription drugs.
Over the last year, I have held 15
townhalls across Burlington and Ocean
Counties, and the number one issue I
continue to hear about is the high cost
of drugs and healthcare.
We have a real chance right now to
pass critical legislation that will have
a tangible and real impact on the lives
of the people we serve:
By passing H.R. 3, we can help lower
the cost of critical drugs like insulin
for the tens of thousands of New
Jersyans struggling with diabetes.
By passing H.R. 3, we can save lives
by making cancer medication more af-
fordable.
By passing H.R. 3, we can finally de-
liver comprehensive dental, vision, and
hearing benefits for seniors under
Medicare, including over 130,000 people
in our district.
And by passing H.R. 3, we can expand
access to the Medicare Savings Pro-
gram, a provision I was proud to intro-
duce and champion to help 3.5 million
seniors afford quality healthcare.
Mr. Speaker, we must take big, bold
action because the challenges that our
neighbors face in affording their
healthcare is critical. I hope my col-
leagues will join me in passing this bill
and making an impact we can all be
proud of.
f
HONORING ALLAN BOGARD ON HIS
RETIREMENT
(Mr. OLSON asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, a Texas
legend, Houston Oilers Coach Bum
Phillips, said this about Hall of Famer
Earl Campbell:
Earl may not be in a class by himself, but
whatever class he is in, it don’t take long to
call the roll.
Those exact words apply to our re-
tired city manager, Allan Bogard.
Allan is retiring after 19 years running
our city.
Sugar Land is Sugar Land because of
Allan. He created Sugar Land Town
Center, brought Constellation Field,
brought Minute Maid’s headquarters to
Sugar Land, made our airport number
one in its class in America, all this
while keeping a AAA bond rating.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 130,000
Texans who live in Sugar Land, Allan
has given us a motto for all time: In
Sugar Land, our sugar is so sweet, we
have no Equal.
f
STAND FOR THE PEOPLE AND
LOWER DRUG COSTS NOW
(Mr. CRIST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. CRIST. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong support of the Elijah E.
Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.
Pinellas County residents, my bosses,
are fed up with the high cost of pre-
scription drugs. One young con-
stituent, Taylor McKenny, said it best:
‘‘You shouldn’t have to choose between
paying rent or paying for life.’’
You see, Taylor has type 1 diabetes,
and when the insurance ran out, Tay-
lor’s family had to pay $120 just for a 3-
day supply of insulin, medicine she has
to take every day simply to stay alive.
A lifesaving drug shouldn’t have a
poisonous list price.
I cosponsored H.R. 3 so that Taylor
can afford her insulin and nearly
600,000 of my constituents can get
cheaper drugs.
I also cosponsored the Doggett
amendment because everyone, those
with or without insurance, should be
protected.
Today’s choice is quite simple: Do
you stand for the people or do you
stand for big pharmaceutical compa-
nies?
I stand for the people.
Lower drug costs now.

HONORING THE LIFE OF SCOTT
BROOKS
(Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute and to revise
and extend his remarks.)
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life
of Charlottean Scott Brooks.
Scott’s life of work and service ended
tragically and senselessly early Mon-
day morning of this week when he was
murdered outside his place of business
in the NoDa area of Charlotte.
Brooks’ Sandwich House is a Char-
lotte institution since 1973, run by
Scott and his twin brother, David. It is
a modest place where you buy a burger
all the way and eat standing outside at
a table. Really good.
Somehow, I had missed that home-
town treasure until just 3 weeks ago
when a friend invited me there for
lunch. Scott spotted me as we came in
and told the cashier our burgers were
on the house—not because Scott was a
fan, but because he was a nice guy.
Scott was holding down the fort
while David convalesced from an in-
jury. That is what brothers like Scott
do.
I could not know then that Scott
would be taken from us all just 17 days
later.
I am grateful for that brief meeting
and for the opportunity to commemo-
rate him to the history of our Nation.
Scott’s brother and his wife and child
should not be mourning him this day,
yet we all are.
Scott Allen Brooks, rest in peace.

SKYROCKETING PRESCRIPTION
DRUG PRICES
(Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Penn-
sylvania asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute
and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, millions of Ameri-
cans are suffering from skyrocketing
prescription drug prices. They have to
choose between medicine and food, or
rent, or utility bills. People are actu-
ally dying because they have been
forced to skip or reduce doses.
Prices aren’t soaring because of the
cost of developing prescription drugs.
Some of these drugs are decades old.
No. Prices are soaring because
drugmakers are jacking up prices wher-
ever and whenever they can to maxi-
mize their profits. And they can do this
because the United States is the only
country in the world that subsidizes re-
search on new drugs and then refuses
to negotiate with drugmakers for lower
prices.
This is insane. Americans shouldn’t
be dying because drug companies want
bigger profits.
I am supporting H.R. 3 because it will
allow Medicare to negotiate drug
prices, cap annual price increases, and
set out-of-pocket maximums for sen-
iors.
It is way past time Congress allowed
Medicare to negotiate for lower drug
prices. I urge my colleagues to vote in
favor of H.R. 3 to lower drug costs now.

SUPPORT SENIORS AND THOSE ON
MEDICARE BY LOWERING THE
COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
(Mrs. AXNE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mrs. AXNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
and call on Congress to support our
seniors and those on Medicare by low-
ering the cost of prescription drugs.
Seniors will get a 1.6 percent cost-of-
living increase this year, yet the cost
of prescription drugs is expected to go
up 3.8 percent.
How can older Americans on a fixed
income afford this? The answer is they
can’t, and they need to act on this.
I have spoken with Iowans who are
rationing their medications or skip-
ping meals just to cover the cost of the
drugs they take.
I heard from Joan in west Des
Moines, who has an autoimmune dis-
ease, and her medication suddenly sky-
rocketed. If she doesn’t take it, she
will need a liver transplant, and she
doesn’t know how she is going to afford
the medication.
John in Madrid discovered his stand-
ard refill of insulin costs more than,
literally, the price of gold.
So something must change. Older
Americans need Congress to act.
That is why I am supporting H.R. 3 to
protect our seniors. It means our older
Americans won’t be robbed of their re-
tirement savings and they will live
healthier lives.
If you want to give seniors a
healthier, happier, safer retirement,
then I call on you to support this bill.

HONORING SERGEANT KORT
PLANTENBERG; CHIEF WARRANT
OFFICER 2 JAMES ROGERS, JR.;
AND CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER 2
CHARLES NORD
(Mr. PHILLIPS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, last
week, my State and our country lost
three young and remarkable service-
members in a tragic helicopter crash
outside of St. Cloud, Minnesota.
Sergeant Kort Plantenberg; Chief
Warrant Officer 2 James Rogers, Jr.;
and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Charles
Nord each served our country with
valor and leave behind grieving fami-
lies and friends and heartbroken com-
munities.
I recently flew with a crew from St.
Cloud, and I lost my own father in a
helicopter crash in the Vietnam war
back in 1969, so my heart is particu-
larly heavy today for Kaley Nord, 2-
year-old Lydia, and her soon-to-be-born
sibling, who will grow up without a fa-
ther.
But we will never forget, and we will
carry their legacies forward in the spir-
it of service, duty, and above all else,
sacrifice.
May their memories be for a blessing.
PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES ARE
OUT OF CONTROL
(Mr. CASTEN of Illinois asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Mr. Speaker,
prescription drug prices are out of con-
trol. Year after year, we see prices rise.
Old drugs become unaffordable, and
new drugs may cost more than a house.
That is why I support H.R. 3, the Eli-
jah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs
Now Act. This bill would change the
lives of the 89,000 seniors on part D in
my district and over 600,000 people on
private health insurance plans in my
district.
One of those, in particular, is Liz
Phelan. Liz lives in Algonquin, Illinois,
and retired after 38 years of public
service. In 2007, she had a double trans-
plant: a kidney and a pancreas. She is
alive today for two reasons: One is the
generosity of a donor, and, the second,
the antirejection drugs that she has to
take to keep her alive.
Those drugs alone cost $662 every 3
months, out of pocket, but because she
needs additional medication, she hits
the Medicare coverage gap, where she
is on the hook for the balance of her
costs.
H.R. 3 would be a game changer for
Liz. It would lower her prescription
drug costs to $2,000 because H.R. 3
would create, for the first time, a cap
on how much seniors need to pay out of
pocket in Medicare. It would make
sure that the drugs she needs to sur-
vive do not increase above the rate of
inflation.
For Liz and for the millions of other
Americans who face high-priced medi-
cines, we must pass H.R. 3.
f
REDUCE OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS
FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker,
today is a historic day for patients in
this country because today we will be
voting for a piece of legislation that
my community in northern Illinois
wants urgently. It cannot wait.
I hear about unfortunate and
unaffordably high drug prices every
time I am home. Recently, a 15-year-
old boy in my district who relies on in-
sulin wrote to me: ‘‘I am concerned
with what my future holds. I need this
medicine to live, and if the costs con-
tinue to rise . . . I am afraid that, one
day, I won’t be able to get the medicine
and I will die.’’
No one should be thinking about the
possibility of death because they can’t
afford a common, live-saving medica-
tion, and the Lower Drug Costs Now
Act delivers the reforms we critically
need because the bill reduces out-of-
pocket costs for prescription drugs; it
creates a new, $2,000 out-of-pocket
limit for seniors; and it allows the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services
to negotiate a fair price for the highest
cost drugs, which will reduce private
insurances premiums and out-of-pocket
costs.
This legislation also incorporates my
bill to prevent drug companies from
making outrageous, unfair price hikes.
And with the savings from lower drug
costs, we reinvest in Medicare, expand-
ing much needed hearing, dental, and
vision services to seniors.
I am proud of this bill. It is a product
of countless hours of research and ne-
gotiation. I would like to thank the
committee chairs, leadership members,
and staff who made it possible.
f
PUT THE NEEDS OF AMERICANS
ABOVE THE GREED OF THE
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, Ameri-
cans are skipping their medications be-
cause the cost of prescription drugs is
too expensive. This is immoral.
Americans are going into debt be-
cause the cost of prescription drugs is
too high. This is immoral.
Americans often pay four times more
for the same drugs as those in foreign
countries. This is immoral.
This is why I rise today in strong
support of H.R. 3, the Elijah E.
Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act,
legislation that will lower the cost of
prescription drugs for millions of
Americans and benefit nearly 500,000
people in my district.
No one in America should have to ra-
tion their medicine. No one in America
should have to travel to another coun-
try because the medication they need
is too unaffordable here.
We have a moral obligation to put
the needs of American people above the
greed of the pharmaceutical industry.
I urge all of my colleagues to vote in
support of this critical piece of legisla-
tion.

tion drug prices by Medicare.
I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 3, the
Lower Drug Costs Now Act, and I am
pleased to see it includes my legisla-
tion, the Respond Now Act, as the basis

H.R. 3 provides $10 billion in direct
funding, including investments di-
rectly into our communities who are

f
PFAS REPRESENTS CLEAR AND
PRESENT DANGER
(Mr. PAPPAS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today on behalf of communities across
the Nation that have been contami-
nated with PFAS.
PFAS represents a clear and present
danger to families in my district, and I
am disappointed that certain provi-
sions to protect public health and our
environment were abandoned by nego-
tiators of the National Defense Author-
ization Act.
I am encouraged that several PFAS-
related provisions were included, like
the one I introduced which creates a
clearinghouse of information for af-
fected servicemembers and their fami-
lies and one that phases out the use of
PFAS in firefighting foam by 2024.
But Congress should have seized the
opportunity to go much further in pro-
tecting people from these toxic-forever
chemicals. Losing provisions for drink-
ing water standards, environmental
protections, and cleanup was a shame-
ful missed opportunity.
People are getting sick from PFAS
contamination, families are scared,
and they are looking to us for answers.
They need action now, and we must
continue to fight for health informa-
tion, stricter regulations, and mitiga-
tion so we can protect families, com-
munities, and the environment from
PFAS.
This fight is just beginning, and I
look forward to working with my col-
leagues in both parties to pass addi-
tional legislation.

PREVENT BIG PHARMA FROM
RAISING THE COST OF PRE-

(Mr. CROW asked and was given per-

minute and to revise and extend his re-

Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
in support of H.R. 3, the Elijah E.
Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.
For too long, we have seen the influ-
ence of Big Pharma on this Chamber.
For every Member of Congress, there
are three industry lobbyists looking to
buy their vote.
Meanwhile, back home in Colorado,
one in three of my constituents can’t
afford to pay for their medication. It
needs to stop.
I am proud to have helped introduce
a provision to H.R. 3 that would pre-
vent Big Pharma from raising the cost
of prescription drugs past the rate of
inflation.
I stand here today for the 300,000
Coloradans with diabetes who will save
75 percent on their insulin. I stand here
today for the 400,000 Coloradans with
asthma, who will save 80 percent on
their prescriptions.
And tomorrow I will cast my vote for
my constituents, people like Sue Way
of Aurora, who, after seeing her insulin
increase by 500 percent, was forced to
ration her medicine, resulting in an
ulcer.
Her story is the story of so many
Coloradans. The time is now to deliver
on our promise to reduce the cost of
prescription drugs.

In a unanimous, bipartisan resolu-

Whereas, many New Jersey families relied
upon the Federal SALT deduction to ensure
tax fairness, and capping the SALT deduc-
tion has placed an unfair burden on New Jer-
sey homeowners; and
Whereas, the SALT deduction cap presents
a barrier to affordable homeownership in
New Jersey, impacting the ability of new,
young families to prosper in the future,
Now, therefore, be it resolved that the New
Jersey State League of Municipalities, in
conference assembled, urges Congress to re-
store the full SALT deduction and provide
more equitable taxation once again to resi-
dents of New Jersey.
Mr. Speaker, it is time to listen to
our local elected officials, and I thank
Committeewoman Amalia Duarte of
Mendham Township for leading this
resolution.

GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida?
There was no objection.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, on Mon-
day, the Rules Committee met and re-
ported a rule, House Resolution 758,
providing for the consideration of H.R.
3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug
Costs Now Act; H.R. 5038, the Farm
Workforce Modernization Act; and the
conference report to accompany S.
1790, the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2020.
The rule provides for consideration of
H.R. 3 under a structured rule and
makes in order 12 amendments, includ-
ing the Republican substitute.
The rule provides 4 hours of general
debate, with 3 hours equally divided
among and controlled by the chairs and
the ranking minority members of the
Committees on Education and Labor,
Energy and Commerce, and Ways and
Means, and 1 hour equally divided and
controlled by the majority leader and
minority leader. The rule also provides
a motion to recommit.
The rule provides for consideration of
H.R. 5038 under a closed rule, with 1
hour of debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and the ranking
member of the Judiciary Committee. It
also provides for a motion to recom-
mit.
The rule further provides for consid-
eration of the conference report to ac-
company S. 1790 with 1 hour of debate
and a motion to recommit, if applica-
ble.
The rule also authorizes the chair of
the Intelligence Committee to insert in
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD explana-
tory statements as he deems necessary.
Finally, the rule provides house-
keeping items to close out the first ses-
sion of this Congress, such as same-day
authority, suspension authority, dis-
trict work period instructions, and lan-
guage to convene the Second Session of
the 116th Congress on January 7.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong
support of the bills in this rule.
Mr. Speaker, only a few times in our
history has Congress come together to
pass legislation to dramatically im-
prove the life of every American—So-
cial Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the
Children’s Health Insurance Program,
the Americans with Disabilities Act,
Medicare’s drug benefit, and, of course,
the Affordable Care Act. We change
lives. We save lives.
Now, we continue that work with
H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower
Drug Costs Now Act. The passage of
this bill will take this legislation for-
ward to join those momentous commit-
ments to the health and security of all
Americans.
Mr. Speaker, we pay more for our
prescription drugs than any other
country on Earth. We have made in-
credible advances in medical science
and developed cures not only for our
own people but also for the rest of the
world. Yet, even when our own re-
searchers and scientists have dedicated
their lives to creating lifesaving drugs,
too many of our fellow Americans can’t
afford to benefit from their brilliance.
In the United States today, a disease
or a chronic condition can force you
into bankruptcy or require you to
choose between paying for medicine or
paying for food or rent.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10035
December 11, 2019
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3 makes funda-
mental reforms to reduce drug prices
to keep the cost hikes to no more than
inflation and to limit out-of-pocket
costs for those on Medicare, employer
plans, and private health insurance.
To help secure these patient protec-
tions, we will require our government
to negotiate prices directly with drug
companies.
Mr. Speaker, I served as Secretary of
Health and Human Services for 8 years
in the Clinton administration. I repeat-
edly asked for the ability to negotiate
with drug companies.
Only drug companies get to come to
Medicare and set their own prices.
b 1245
Hospitals don’t get to do that; doc-
tors don’t get to do that; home
healthcare agencies don’t get to do
that; and medical equipment providers
don’t get to do that.
Negotiation is the hallmark of good
governance and a standard feature of
government policy.
Mr. Speaker, we negotiate for every-
thing, including military equipment
and work with contractors. If we can
negotiate for big ships, then we can ne-
gotiate for little pills. It is only drug
companies that are able to write them-
selves a blank check from our tax-
payers. Our legislation ends that prac-
tice.
Now is the time to join every other
country on Earth in allowing our gov-
ernment to bargain for better prices
and to put a cap on our out-of-pocket
costs.
As citizens, we have always been
willing to subsidize poorer countries.
But subsidizing England, France, Can-
ada, Germany, Australia, Japan, Swe-
den, Norway, and Denmark is not our
responsibility. We are not their deep
pockets.
Mr. Speaker, we should not pay sub-
stantially more for the same medicines
than people in those countries. The
current broken system is costing our
families and businesses hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars. We must not accept
this waste or this unfairness any
longer.
Our bill is a solid plan to reduce out-
of-pocket healthcare costs for every
American, and it will create a huge
savings for taxpayers.
These savings will allow us to make
significant investments in the extraor-
dinary biomedical science institutions
that foster innovation, such as the Na-
tional Institutes of Health and our
great research universities.
These savings will allow us to mod-
ernize Medicare hearing and vision
benefits and dental coverage.
This bill will expand our capacity for
innovation and make drug companies
more efficient. H.R. 3 is a historic step
forward, and it will make all of our
lives better.
Mr. Speaker, this rule also contains
the Farm Workforce Modernization Act
of 2019. This bill empowers families to
build lives in the United States with-
out the constant fear of being up-
rooted. It prioritizes the well-being of
immigrant families, many of whom
provide essential support for our Na-
tion’s agricultural sector. This bill is
an important step forward in improv-
ing our immigration system, in helping
to make sure that we treat everyone
with compassion and dignity.
Finally, this rule also allows for con-
sideration of the National Defense Au-
thorization Act conference report. The
first NDAA under our new Democratic
majority fulfills one of Congress’ cru-
cial constitutional duties: providing for
the common defense of our Nation.
The final conference report delivers a
wide-ranging list of priorities the
American people strongly support,
such as paid parental leave, the end of
the widow’s tax, better services for our
men and women in uniform, and pro-
tections for Dreamers.
This report is the product of months
of hard work by Chairman SMITH and
members of the committee and will un-
doubtedly keep our country safe.
Mr. Speaker, I proudly support these
historic steps forward. Let’s pass this
rule and these bills.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume,
and I thank Ms. SHALALA for yielding
me the customary 30 minutes.
Mr. Speaker, today we are consid-
ering a bill that does a lot of things,
and, if nothing else, this should be an
object lesson on why you don’t leave
everything to the last minute because,
indeed, that is what we have done in
this year, this session of Congress. So
we have got a rule that has three fairly
different bills contained.
We are considering a bill to reform
the H–2A guest worker programs, the
National Defense Authorization Act
conference report, and H.R. 3, a bill
that will limit American patients from
treatments and cures of tomorrow.
H.R. 5038, the Farm Workforce Mod-
ernization Act, allows aliens who have
worked in the United States for 180
days, are deportable, and have been
continually present to be granted cer-
tified agricultural work status. The
status may also be extended to a re-
cipient’s spouse and children. Certified
workers can then apply for a green
card path to citizenship, and they are
not counted toward the statutory cap.
In addition, the bill would subject H–
2A users to a private right of action
and will not provide long-term wage re-
lief. While the H–2A guest worker visa
program arguably needs reform, this
bill expands the ability to obtain legal
status without adequate requirements,
documentation, or protections for the
H–2A program users.
Second, the National Defense Au-
thorization Act is a bipartisan agree-
ment to provide for a 3.1 percent pay
raise for our troops, reform privatized
military housing, continue rebuilding
readiness, provide security assistance
to our allies, and hold the Pentagon ac-
countable through reports on
auditability.
The bill also protects the homeland
by including my language requiring an
effort to identify hostile International
Mobile Subscriber Identity catchers,
known as stingrays, which are used to
locate and spy on Americans.
Last, the NDAA repeals the widow’s
tax and prohibits the use of a chemical
compound known as PFAS in fire-
fighting foam after October 2024.
I am pleased that we were able to
reach an agreement to maintain the
strongest military in the world.
Now, let’s turn to H.R. 3, the third
bill that is being contained in this
rather wide-ranging rule. This bill at-
tempts to address the high cost of
drugs, a goal of which I am supportive,
but this bill severely limits patient ac-
cess to potentially new lifesaving
drugs.
Republicans have offered a substitute
bill, H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More
Cures Act of 2019, that includes bipar-
tisan policies to lower drug costs for
Americans.
There are a lot of reasons that Mem-
bers should support H.R. 19, which will
now be our amendment in the nature of
a substitute. Since it is H.R. 19, let me
limit myself to 19 reasons.
One, H.R. 19 will lower drug costs for
American patients, while protecting
access to new treatments and cures.
Two, H.R. 19 is bipartisan, including
more than 40 drug pricing policies that
have passed through House and Senate
committees this year.
Three, H.R. 19 would pass—could
pass—both Chambers of Congress and
be signed into law in calendar year
2019.
Four, H.R. 19 will cap out-of-pocket
costs in Medicare part D for seniors at
$3,100 per year, ensuring protection
from the high cost encountered with
prescription drugs.
Five, H.R. 19 saves money for pa-
tients and their families rather than
saving money just for the government.
Six, H.R. 19 includes policies such as
the CREATES Act and pay-for-delay to
prevent pharmaceutical companies
from gaming the system.
Seven, H.R. 19 promotes healthy
competition for lower cost generics.
Eight, H.R. 19 corrects for the in-
creased threshold it takes to reach cat-
astrophic coverage in part D, which is
not yet fixed for plan year 2020. This
bill will provide seniors with a refund
in 2020 for costs they should never have
had to incur in the first place.
Nine, H.R. 19 strengthens trans-
parency and accountability in the ex-
isting drug pricing system.
Ten, H.R. 19 lowers the cost of insulin
by capping the costs for seniors in
Medicare part D at $50 per month and
adds additional incentives for insur-
ance to cover their fair share of insulin
costs.
Eleven, H.R. 19 lowers the cost of
drug administration by not paying
drastically more for the same service,
whether it is provided in a hospital or

H10036 December 11, 2019
other more traditionally expensive en-
vironments, the so-called site-neutral
provision.
Twelve, H.R. 19 establishes a new ne-
gotiator at the United States Trade
Representative to ensure that America
is not subsidizing the world’s drug
costs.
Thirteen, H.R. 19 makes permanent a
threshold of 7.5 percent of the adjusted
gross income for purposes of the med-
ical expense tax deduction in the Inter-
nal Revenue Code. Recall that, under
the Affordable Care Act, this threshold
was increased to 10 percent, which
many seniors found onerous. It was re-
duced in the passage of the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act of 2017 to the threshold of
7.5 percent, but that threshold then ex-
pires, and it goes and reverts back to
the 10 percent threshold at the end of
this year. This would make that per-
manent.
Fourteen, H.R. 19 requires pricing in-
formation in direct-to-consumer adver-
tisements.
Fifteen, H.R. 19 cracks down on phar-
macy benefit managers by requiring
more transparency in the reporting of
aggregate rebates, discounts, and other
price concessions.
Sixteen, H.R. 19 helps access to pre-
scription drugs in rural areas by re-
forming direct and indirect remunera-
tion fees, the so-called dreaded DIR fee
clawback that every community phar-
macist dislikes so intensely.
Seventeen, H.R. 19 increases trans-
parency into patient listings so that
manufacturers of generics and
biosimilars will have adequate infor-
mation to enter the market.
Eighteen, H.R. 19 removes uncer-
tainty at the pharmacy counter by re-
quiring insurance companies to provide
pricing information to doctors so that
patients and their doctors can have dis-
cussions about what medicine is best
for them and what the cost will be.
Finally, number 19, H.R. 19 allows
biomedical innovation to continue to
thrive. It does not abandon the success
of the 21st Century Cures bill. It lowers
drug costs for Americans, while main-
taining access to drugs that exist now
and ensuring that that access is sus-
tained in the future.
Mr. Speaker, there are many more
than three reasons to oppose H.R. 3,
but let’s limit ourselves to three rea-
sons so compelling that, really, you
shouldn’t need to go into any more.
Number one, the Congressional Budg-
et Office, the Council of Economic Ad-
visers, and the California Life Sciences
Association have found that H.R. 3 will
result in fewer drugs for Americans.
There is no way to predict what could
be included in this fewer drugs. It could
be the cure for Alzheimer’s; it could be
the cure for ALS; or it could be the
cure for pancreatic cancer.
There is some disparity in the num-
ber of cures that would be lost with the
passage of this bill, but here is the cen-
tral thesis: Every organization that
has looked at this has said that there
will be fewer drugs introduced after the
passage of this bill.
b 1300
In addition, access to drugs that help
or cure or maintain a healthy life will
be at risk. The six-referenced countries
in H.R. 3 have 30 to 60 percent fewer
new medications than the United
States of America. This is what is at
stake today.
Number 2, H.R. 3 claims to negotiate
drug prices, but with a 95 percent ex-
cise tax for manufacturers who fail to
reach a price agreement with the gov-
ernment, it is more akin to a hostage-
taking and then shooting the hostage.
There are concerns that this is un-
constitutional under the Takings
Clause of the Constitution. This take-
over of the entire drug industry in the
United States is not only bad policy
but may be constitutionally perilous.
Interestingly enough, when this bill
was marked up in our committee, one
of our Members on the Republican side
spoke to this issue, tried to offer an
amendment that would have provided
severability, so that if the law was
found to be unconstitutional, that the
part that was unconstitutional could
be struck down and the rest could
stand. But for whatever reason, the
majority rejected that amendment and
it was defeated on a party line vote.
Number three, and this is critically
important, H.R. 3 will never become
law. The majority leader of the other
body has said that H.R. 3 is dead-on-ar-
rival in the Senate. And President
Trump has related how H.R. 3 is not
good for Americans.
I think it is important that we fight
for a world where research into life-
threatening illnesses never ceases, no
matter how many failures occur before
a cure is found.
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the
rule, opposition to the underlying bill,
H.R. 3, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BUR-
GESS).
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from California (Ms.
LOFGREN), the distinguished chair of
the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immi-
gration and Citizenship.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I am
here to speak in support of the Farm
Workforce Modernization Act, an event
that should be a cause of joy for Mem-
bers on both sides of the aisle and for
America.
We have tried and failed for dozens of
years to deal with the issue of the farm
workforce. We have never been able to
get a majority vote on the floor of this
House. So this year, we tried a dif-
ferent approach.
Starting last March, we had stake-
holders, the United Farm Workers
Union, the growers and the farmers sit
down together, listen to each other,
understand each other and what their
needs were. They were joined by a bi-
partisan group of members who cared
about this issue, and we came up with
this bill, a compromise that does this:
It secures the status of the million or
so farm workers who don’t have their
proper documentation by allowing
them to get a certified agriculture
worker visa that is renewable, and ulti-
mately, if they wish, after a significant
period of time, to apply for legal per-
manent residence. It streamlines the
H–2A program, so it works better for
employers and actually works better
for workers.
We stabilized the wages. We allowed
the dairy industry to get access to the
H–2A program. We increased the avail-
ability of farmworker housing while
lowering the cost to employers.
And, finally, once this whole thing is
implemented, we have always believed
that if you have a workable immigra-
tion system, you ought to enforce it.
And so we will implement E-Verify
after full implementation, but only for
the Ag sector.
I would note that the Farm Labor Or-
ganizing Committee of the AFL–CIO,
UFW, Farmworker Justice, the Catho-
lic Bishops—over 300 agricultural orga-
nizations have asked that we pass this
bill.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD
a letter in support of the Farm Work-
force Modernization Act.
NOVEMBER 18, 2019.
Hon. NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY,
Minority Leader, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: The undersigned groups, rep-
resenting a broad cross-section of agri-
culture and its allies, urge you to advance
the Farm Workforce Modernization Act
(H.R. 5038) through the House to address the
labor crisis facing American agriculture. A
stable, legal workforce is needed to ensure
farmers and ranchers have the ability to con-
tinue producing an abundant, safe, and af-
fordable food supply.
The effects of agriculture’s critical short-
age of labor reach far beyond the farm gate,
negatively impacting our economic competi-
tiveness, local economies, and jobs. Econo-
mists have found that every farm worker en-
gaged in high-value, labor-intensive crop and
livestock production sustains two to three
off-farm jobs. As foreign producers take ad-
vantage of our labor shortage and gain mar-
ket share, America will export not only our
food production but also thousands of these
farm-dependent jobs. Securing a reliable and
skilled workforce is essential, not only for
the agricultural industry but for the U.S.
economy as a whole.
The House must pass legislation that pre-
serves agriculture’s experienced workforce
by allowing current farm workers to earn
legal status. For future needs, legislation
must include an agricultural worker visa
program that provides access to a legal and
reliable workforce moving forward. This visa
program needs to be more accessible, pre-
dictable, and flexible to meet the needs of
producers, including those with year-round
labor needs, such as dairy and livestock
which currently do not have meaningful ac-
cess to any program.
While the bill does include a few provisions
that raise significant concerns for the agri-
cultural community, we are committed to
working together throughout the legislative
process to fully address these issues. It is
vital to move the Farm Workforce Mod-
ernization Act (H.R. 5038) through the House
as a significant step in working to meet the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H10038 December 11, 2019
It should be a model on how we can leg-
islate and get something done for the
American people.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Florida
(Mr. DIAZ-BALART), a valuable member
of the Committee on Appropriations.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today in support of the underlying
bill, the Agriculture Workforce Mod-
ernization Act.
Now, when you read the title, maybe
folks will think that this is only an ag-
riculture bill. But in reality, this bill
also helps to deal with a vital national
security issue: A stable supply of agri-
cultural goods produced here in the
United States of America. Not by a for-
eign power who does not have our in-
terests in mind, and could use our food
security as a weapon, but, no, agricul-
tural products grown here by patriotic
American farmers.
And this issue will not happen by
itself. The H–2A system that our farm-
ers now use to get their workforce—
frankly, when they are not able to find
American workers—is absolutely bro-
ken. It is antiquated, and it is just not
responsive to the changing needs of the
patriotic American farmer.
That is why Members from both sides
of the aisle have come together with
over 300 farming organizations to draft
a bill that ensures that in the United
States of America those who grow our
food will be able to continue to grow
our food and have the adequate work-
force that they need.
No bill is perfect, and this one isn’t
perfect either. But, again, this bill, if it
moves forward and gets to the Presi-
dent’s desk—and this bill, if it moves
forward, can be changed and tweaked
to make sure that it gets to the Presi-
dent’s desk—and if we don’t do that, we
will be, frankly, letting down our farm-
ers, letting them down one more time,
and, again, opening up the door to a
national security threat that we do not
need to allow to happen.
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’
on the underlying bill.
But before I yield back, Mr. Speaker,
I would like to thank a few people.
Some have already been thanked: Mike
Carlton from Florida Fruit & Vege-
table Association, for his work to en-
sure that Florida’s agricultural inter-
ests were represented in the negotia-
tions.
I also would like to thank a few staff-
ers: I thank David Shahoulian from the
Committee on the Judiciary who has
been amazing over these years; Carrie
Meadows from Representative
NEWHOUSE’s staff; and also Cesar Gon-
zalez, my chief of staff, who has been
invaluable, by the way, in years of
working to try to have solutions to an
issue that we all know needs to take
place.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DIAZ-
BALART), my colleague for representing
Florida in the negotiations so well.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr.
PAPPAS).
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, when I
travel around New Hampshire asking
constituents what is on their minds,
there is no topic more urgent or more
personal than combatting the sky-
rocketing cost of prescription drugs.
I have heard from a senior who is un-
able to retire because his life is depend-
ent on drugs that cost $3,000 out-of-
pocket.
I have heard from a mother who
shares a painful chronic condition with
her daughter and has to decide every
month whose prescription to fill be-
cause she can’t fill both on her fixed in-
come.
Americans can no longer afford Big
Pharma’s runaway costs. That is why I
am proud to support H.R. 3, which
makes historic reforms to drive down
the cost of prescription drugs while ex-
panding and strengthening Medicare.
This package also includes my Advanc-
ing Enrollment and Reducing Drug
Costs Act, which makes prescription
drugs more accessible for seniors.
My provision assists low-income sen-
iors by automatically enrolling them
in Medicare Part D’s subsidy program,
ensuring they receive this benefit with-
out jumping through bureaucratic
hoops.
It is time to deliver transformational
change and pass H.R. 3 to ensure the
health and well-being of the American
people.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself 30 seconds.
Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 3, runs
the risk of quickly stifling innovation
in the new drug space. A preliminary
Congressional Budget Office analysis of
this bill has stated that it would result
in 15 fewer new drugs coming on the
market over the next 10 years, and we
all know drugs are in the pipeline for
much longer than that. The actual
pipeline to deliver new product is 14
years, so it is that second 10 years
where the real risk of this bill becomes
apparent.
The cure for Alzheimer’s may be one
of those ones that is included in that
list of drugs that are never developed
in the first place. That is why we need
to defeat H.R. 3.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from
Vermont (Mr. WELCH).
Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, today, the
House is going to have an opportunity
to do something that has long-needed
to be done and will benefit every single
American in every single business that
is providing health insurance for their
valued employees. We have a chance to
pass the Elijah E. Cummings Lower
Drug Costs Now Act.
Here is what is significant about it,
but first a word about Elijah:
In April of 2017, Elijah and I went to
the White House and met with Presi-
dent Trump, who said all the right
things:
‘‘Why are we getting ripped off by
Pharma?’’
‘‘Why can’t we import safe medica-
tions?’’
‘‘Why can’t we lower costs?’’
Today, President Trump, we are
going to do it.
Two things are finally being done:
First, the House of Representatives,
on behalf of all consumers, is going to
allow the Health and Human Services
secretary to negotiate prices, not just
pay the rip-off prices demanded.
Second, we are adopting an idea that
President Trump had: ‘‘Put a cap, 120
percent.’’ We will not pay more than
that, what other countries pay for the
same medication.
President Trump put it in his blunt
way: ‘‘We are being suckers.’’
We are putting a cap on that price.
This will lower the cost of prescription
drugs over 10 years by a half a trillion
dollars.
Finally, our government is standing
up on behalf of consumers in not pro-
tecting Pharma against unlimited
price gouging.
And second, what is inspiring to me
about this is the benefits go to every-
one. Employers in Vermont, they want
their employees to have healthcare,
but those premiums keep going up and
up and they have to trade healthcare
benefits for wages and salary increases.
So that means our employers are
going to get the benefit of lower pre-
miums; our individuals are going to get
the benefit of lower premiums; and sen-
iors, who have been hammered with co-
pays and deductibles, are going to get
lower costs as well.
Individual drugs, too, you won’t be
getting killed on those, folks with in-
sulin and others. So let’s pass this for
Elijah.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Wash-
ington State (Mr. NEWHOUSE), previous
member of the Rules Committee and a
valuable member of the Committee on
Appropriations.
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank my good friend from Texas for
yielding. I rise today in strong support
of the underlying legislation, H.R. 5083,
the Farm Workforce Modernization
Act.
This is a critical piece of legislation
for my constituents, certainly in Cen-
tral Washington, but for farmers and
ranchers across the country in need of
a stable and legal workforce.
I am grateful for my friend, Rep-
resentative LOFGREN, for including Re-
publicans in these negotiations and
bringing together a diverse bipartisan
group of Members of Congress, agricul-
tural stakeholders, farmers and pro-
ducers, labor unions and farmworker
associations to write a piece of legisla-
tion that will go a long way toward

providing certainty for our Ag indus-
try.
The House has failed to address Ag
labor reform since 1986. For the last 30
years, the crisis facing farmers has
only been exacerbated, and the need for
fixes has become even more clear.
Today, we have an opportunity to
continue this process and bring relief
to farmers and ranchers, not just those
I represent, but dairy farmers in the
Midwest, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio,
Michigan and Northeast, New York and
Maine; the famous peach orchards of
Georgia and South Carolina; and cer-
tainly the orange groves in Texas and
the salad bowl of California and Ari-
zona—all across the country.
Like past efforts, this bill may not be
the perfect solution, but it is a signifi-
cant improvement over the status quo.
This legislation stabilizes our current
workforce by implementing the first of
its kind, merit-based immigration pro-
gram for agricultural workers who
have spent decades in our fields.
The bill streamlines our current H–
2A program and reduces the bureau-
cratic red tape for farmers. It addresses
rising costs of guest worker wages and
implements E-Verify for the Ag indus-
try, something Republicans have been
asking for since the rollout of the pro-
gram.
Despite the progress this legislation
makes, there is still work to do. It does
not address every sector of our Na-
tion’s Ag industry. We still have to
find a solution for our processors. We
need to improve the equitable housing
options. There are many other aspects
of our broken immigration system we
must work together to fix.
b 1315
A ‘‘yes’’ vote today on this bill is a
vote to continue the process and get
this bill to the Senate.
I want to thank the staff, certainly
Travis Martinez and Carrie Meadows,
but also David Shahoulian and Betsy
Lawrence on Ms. LOFGREN’s staff.
Many people have put a lot of time into
this effort.
Our farmers and ranchers desperately
need relief. Men and women who con-
tribute to our ag industry need cer-
tainty. This bill is the first step.
I urge my colleagues to vote for the
underlying legislation and encourage
their input as we continue to perfect
the bill and send it to the President’s
desk.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. DOGGETT).
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, for
those insured who rely on insulin or
who are fortunate enough to win the
lottery to have their drugs selected to
be negotiated, this is a valuable piece
of legislation. But for 30 million Amer-
icans who are uninsured, they are de-
nied any guarantee of lower prices.
Inexplicably, this rule rejects a pro-
posal by me and 28 of our colleagues to
provide relief for the uninsured. It bars
all of my amendments to improve H.R.
3, including those that addressed out-
rageous new drug launch prices; price
spike protection, which price spikes
are occurring at an alarming rate, by
the thousands; and ensuring negotia-
tion for those drugs where the tax-
payers are actually picking up the tab
to finance the research that produces
the drug.
Of all of these, the most troubling
concerns the uninsured. USA Today
just published a powerful op-ed by Ni-
cole Smith-Holt. It is entitled: ‘‘My
Son Died From Rationing Insulin.
Democrats’ Drug Pricing Plan Still
Wouldn’t Help Him.’’ She writes of her
son, age 26, who aged out of his par-
ents’ insurance and had a job with no
benefits.
She expresses the same concern that
a group of Michigan high schoolers re-
cently wrote me in a compelling letter
that they are raising money to help
those who lack insurance buy their
drugs, saying: ‘‘Drug manufacturers
should not be able to determine who
does and who does not get better. Ev-
eryone deserves to be healthy . . . .‘’
And everyone deserves to be helped
by our legislation, but some are left
out. My goal has never been to turn
this bill to the right or to the left, but
to deal with those and provide assur-
ances to those who have been left out
by it.
Under this legislation, it will still re-
main illegal, a violation of Federal
law, to negotiate lower drug prices on
two-thirds of the drugs——
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Texas.
Mr. DOGGETT. It remains illegal to
negotiate on two-thirds of the drugs
that are covered by Medicare. Prescrip-
tion drug price gouging, enabled by
government-approved monopolies with-
out any restraint, is not limited to one
disease or one class of drugs.
The perfect should certainly not get
in the way of the good in drafting such
legislation, but we should be doing
more to deliver the good we promised.
I reluctantly oppose this rule.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself 30 seconds.
Mr. Speaker, I want to share a letter
that I received. This is from a woman
who had lost her daughter to suicide
following an episode of severe
postpartum depression. She writes:
After many long years of research and de-
velopment, on 3/19, calendar year 2019, the
Food and Drug Administration approved
Zulresso, the first medicine to successfully
treat moderate to severe postpartum depres-
sion worldwide. It is a 60-hour IV treatment,
administered in a certified hospital setting.
It is effective in as little as 20 hours. Had
this medicine been available, I feel that my
daughter would be alive today.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Florida (Ms. CASTOR).
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker,
I want to thank my colleague from
Florida (Ms. SHALALA) for yielding
time and, also, for her leadership
throughout the years in fighting to
keep drug costs low. It really matters
to families all across this country.
I feel like shouting this from the top
of the Capitol dome: We are going to
pass a bill that will allow Medicare to
negotiate drug prices in America.
This is kind of an all-American con-
cept, isn’t it, negotiate fair prices?
But for too long, Big Pharma, these
drug companies, have gouged American
families and consumers, and they have
taken advantage of it, haven’t they? I
mean, these prices are astronomical.
Families across America are often
paying 4, 5, 10 times more the amount
for their prescriptions than families in
other countries. That is not right, and
it is especially not right in this coun-
try where it is the U.S. taxpayer who is
often providing the funding for the
basic research to develop these drugs.
So let’s all shout it from the Capitol
dome, the very top: We are going to
allow—we are going to direct Medicare
to negotiate prices to bring the cost of
prescription drugs down.
We are going to not just contain that
in Medicare, but make sure that it is
spread, and those cost savings are real-
ized for all of the families who rely on
private insurance.
And then, with the billions of dollars
in savings, we are going to improve
Medicare. For a long time, Medicare
has not provided comprehensive bene-
fits for vision, for hearing, for dental
care. These are fundamental health

So what a winning proposition for
American families. And I am so proud
that it is the Democrats and our new
majority that can deliver on this prom-
ise for the people.
Lower drug costs now.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as may consume.
If we defeat the previous question,
Republicans will amend the rule imme-
diately to consider H.R. 2207, the Pro-
tect Medical Innovation Act of 2019.
This bill, which now has 256 bipartisan
cosponsors, will repeal the excise tax
on medical devices that is set to go
into effect January 1, 2020.
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of this amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous material, immediately prior to
the vote on the previous question.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas?
There was no objection.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from Indi-
ana (Mrs. BROOKS), my good friend, a
valuable member of the Energy and
Commerce Committee.
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, if we defeat the previous question,
we can move to pass H.R. 2207.
Why is it so important that we repeal
this disastrous medical device tax?
Since 2013, when I came to Congress,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H10040 December 11, 2019
have worked in a bipartisan way to
delay and, ultimately, defeat this dis-
astrous tax.
And why is that so important? It is
not just about the economics of a tax;
it is about patients. This is about inno-
vation for patients, and higher taxes
mean fewer innovations will be devel-
oped for patients. Fewer lives will be
saved because, when we tax this crit-
ical industry, it will make it harder for
them to come up with and fund the
next lifesaving technology.
Tell that to the over a million people
a year, worldwide, who receive im-
plants like pacemakers. These folks
rely on these lifesaving devices. So
many of the innovations will not come
to market.
Medical devices allow patients to un-
dergo fewer intensive procedures, with
shorter hospitalizations and rehabilita-
tion time, which ultimately lowers the
overall cost of patient care.
Beyond patient care, this is an amaz-
ing industry; and if we tax these busi-
nesses, jobs will be lost. We already
know that, when the tax was in place,
29,000 jobs were lost in this industry.
These are high-paying jobs in States
across the country.
Indiana is one of the top States in
the country to have these types of
medical device jobs. These pay 30 per-
cent higher. The degree of expertise
and the skill of these workers, particu-
larly in the area of research and devel-
opment and manufacturing, is unbe-
lievable. And these people work day in
and day out to provide better medical
devices to consumers, not just here in
this country, but around the globe.
So reinstating this medical device
tax, which will take place on January
1 of 2020, will hurt the success not just
of these businesses, but it will roll
back innovations and stifle R&D of
these lifesaving and life-altering med-
ical advances.
We have a chance, with 256 cospon-
sors, to stand together and repeal this
tax. I urge this body to pass the repeal
of the medical device tax.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from Mas-
sachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN).
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I want
to thank my colleague from Florida for
yielding.
Today, the House considers historic
legislation to lower prescription drug
prices and deliver a transformational
expansion to Medicare under H.R. 3,
the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug
Costs Now Act of 2019.
The namesake of this bill inspired
many Members of this body, myself in-
cluded, to act boldly on behalf of work-
ing families like the one I grew up in.
It is time to flip the status quo on a
system that has pocketed billions off
the backs of patients like my dad who
suffer from chronic diseases like MS.
I am proud to have championed a
provision which added a critical lever
of transparency and accountability by
requiring a GAO study on the negotia-
tion program, essentially ensuring that
there is no unfair manipulation or
gaming at play. While I regret that my
amendment to support baseline knowl-
edge of addiction among prescribers
was not made in order, I look forward
to supporting this important bill.
I am grateful to leadership, my col-
leagues, and the committees of juris-
diction for bringing us all here to this
point today.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from In-
diana (Mr. BAIRD) to speak on the
amendment as part of the defeat of the
previous question.
Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
ranking member for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of the 60,000 direct and indirect jobs
that the medical device industry brings
to my home State.
The last 4 years, Congress has worked
together to continually suspend the
medical device tax because they know
that it doesn’t make sense. This tax is
a bane to innovation; it damages our
manufacturing sector; it raises
healthcare prices; and it hurts high-
paying jobs.
What our medical device industry
needs more than anything is certainty.
There has been enough upheaval in our
healthcare system over the last decade
to last us a lifetime.
Let’s show our support for the hard-
working Americans, the good jobs, the
patients, and the employers and perma-
nently repeal this tax.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CORREA).
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong support of the Farm Workforce
Modernization Act of 2019.
I want to thank Representative
LOFGREN for her leadership, as well as
colleagues on both sides of the aisle,
for making this vote today happen. It
will be a historical vote.
California, my home State, is our Na-
tion’s bread basket; yet, over 40 per-
cent of California’s farms don’t have
the workforce they need to feed our
population. The same is true for many
farms across the country that depend
on skilled immigrant farmworkers.
These men and women work in our
fields to plant, care, and harvest our
produce that feeds our families, both in
the U.S. and internationally. They do
good work, good honest work, but live
in an uncertain situation.
Farm owners and farmworkers agree
that this reform is desperately needed.
This bill offers a stable workforce for
our farmers, who need to compete in
the global food markets, and provides
an earned legal status for farmworkers.
I urge passage of H.R. 5038.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Indiana
(Mr. BUCSHON) to continue our speakers
on the defeat of the previous question
and in support of their amendment.
Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, there
are over 150 medical device companies
in the State of Indiana representing
more than 20,000 jobs. These are high-
paying, stable jobs, with more than $1
billion in Indiana payrolls. But, more
importantly, they provide lifesaving
products for the American consumer.
As a physician, I know the impor-
tance of the innovation and the techno-
logical advances these companies pro-
vide, and the medical device tax is an
onerous tax that is helping to stymie
this innovation and technology.
b 1330
By defeating the previous question,
we can bring up H.R. 2207, the Protect
Medical Innovation Act of 2019, and fi-
nally repeal permanently the onerous
excise tax on the sale of medical de-
vices in our country. This will allow
for more treatments, and this will
allow for more cures.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LOFGREN).
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I want
to make a few additional comments on
the Farm Workforce Modernization Act
since the gentlewoman from Florida
had a little bit of time to provide.
There have been some who have criti-
cized, I think incorrectly, the bill, that
it does not actually stabilize wages in
the H–2A program. That is incorrect.
The bargain that was made by the
United Farm Workers union and the
various employer groups was to: first,
freeze wages for 1 year; second, to limit
how fast wages could rise to 3.25 per-
cent or how low to 1.5 percent; and
also, to preclude changes in the middle
of a contract, so there would be sta-
bility.
I just wanted to get that issue on the
table. People who misunderstand it
will be relieved to know that that is
not correct.
I want to address another issue,
which has to do with the legalization
provision. We have several million
farmworkers in the United States
today. Half of them don’t have their
proper papers. They are living in a
state of fear.
I was out in the Central Valley re-
cently. These are hardworking people
who have been here for decades in some
cases. There is no line for them to get
into to get legal. They are so afraid
that they are afraid to go to mass.
This bill allows them to apply for a
temporary visa, an agricultural worker
visa that is renewable. It allows them
to go back and forth if they need to go
to a funeral in their country of birth.
It allows them to work legally.
After an extended period of time, if
they want, they can apply to become
legal permanent residents of the
United States, or they can just stay on
their temporary visas. Their families
are included because we should not be
in the position of breaking up hard-
working families.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
an additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from California.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I would
like to note that this bill is the prod-
uct of a lot of time. It was introduced

in October. It was marked up in the Ju-
diciary Committee before Thanks-
giving, and here we are today, not that
far from Christmas, finally, hopefully,
passing it.
We have been in discussions with var-
ious Senators. There is nothing ever
for sure with the United States Senate,
but I will say there is a recognition and
an interest that doing nothing is not
acceptable for farmers or for farm-
workers.
I hope we can pass this bill today.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Indiana
(Mr. PENCE) to continue to speak on
the amendment that we will offer if we
defeat the previous question,
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentleman for yielding. As ranking
member of the House Energy and Com-
merce Subcommittee on Health, I
thank my colleague, Dr. BURGESS, for
his steadfast leadership on this issue.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join 255 of
my colleagues as a cosponsor of H.R.
2207, the Protect Medical Innovation
Act. I rise today to remind my fellow
Members that time is running out. We
must repeal the medical device tax be-
fore it goes into effect on January 1,
2020.
This bill has broad bipartisan support
from Members in both Chambers who
recognize the detrimental impact this
tax has on constituents who rely on
lifesaving medical devices or are em-
ployed by the industry.
If Congress fails to act this year, the
seemingly small 2.3 percent excise tax
would have a significant impact on pa-
tients and the healthcare industry.
The medical device industry employs
400,000 hardworking Americans, includ-
ing 20,000 Hoosiers. When the medical
device tax was in effect, nearly 20,000
industry jobs were lost nationwide.
Eighty percent of these medical man-
ufacturing companies are small busi-
nesses that need certainty. They need
certainty in order to continue their re-
search and investment in critical life-
saving medical innovations.
This is a tax on innovation and com-
petitiveness, a tax on patients, and a
tax on working families. It is time to
end this job-killing tax once and for
all.
I urge my fellow Members to vote
‘‘no’’ on the previous question so we
can support H.R. 2207.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, may I
inquire as to how much time I have re-
maining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 51⁄2 minutes.
The gentlewoman from Florida has 63⁄4
minutes.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, we have been hearing
from our colleagues from Indiana about
the excise tax on medical devices and
how important it is to repeal that ex-
cise tax on medical devices.
That tax has been delayed several
times but does go into effect January 1.
It is a 2.8 percent excise tax on gross
receipts. We are talking in H.R. 3 about
a 95 percent excise tax. They are talk-
ing about the number of jobs that have
been killed with a 2.8 percent Federal
excise tax. How many jobs are going to
be lost with a 95 percent excise tax?
Again, as I said earlier, this is not a
good faith negotiation with the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services.
This is akin to a hostage situation be-
cause the threat of a 95 percent excise
tax hangs over that discussion.
We have heard a lot about innova-
tion. Let me share with you an excerpt
from a letter that I received from a
constituent after the introduction of
H.R. 3. The letter says: ‘‘I started tak-
ing antidepressants when I was 15.
Since then, I have been hospitalized
three different times for attempts at
suicide. Now I am at a place where I
have found the medication that works
for me; it is literally lifesaving. This
medication is only possible through
years of careful research and invest-
ment and in good supply because of a
free market.
‘‘If we had allowed a bill like H.R. 3
to pass into law previously, then the
medications that have helped me
might not exist. I cannot imagine a
world where people just like me might
go without the proper medication due
to government overreach.’’
The story is repeated over and over
again. Mr. Speaker, Congress passed at
the end of the session in calendar year
2016 the last bill signed into law by
President Obama, the 21st Century
Cures Act.
Mr. Speaker, since the time that bill
was signed into law, it really has been
impressive the number of new things
that are coming onto the market and
those new things that are just over the
horizon.
This bill, H.R. 3, strips the ability for
the 21st Century Cures Act to deliver
on the promise. But here is the good
news. The Rules Committee, in its wis-
dom, made available an amendment in
the nature of a substitute.
I have discussed H.R. 19 in some de-
tail. The amendment in the nature of a
substitute will be the text of H.R. 19 so
Members will have an opportunity to
vote for bipartisan consensus agree-
ments that will lower drug prices now,
that will protect innovation in the fu-
ture, and that, most importantly,
could be signed into law before the end
of the year.
Think about it. This is a deliverable
that we have within our power to bring
to the American people. We should not
give up on that chance.
I have been speaking against H.R. 3.
The NDAA, which is also included in
this legislation, I do support. I cannot
support the guest worker bill.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on
the previous question. Let’s take up
the amendment about the excise tax on
medical devices, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, we have heard dooms-
day predictions from my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle that our Na-
tion’s drug innovation will be deci-
mated by this bill. Mr. Speaker, if I
thought this bill would slow down or
eliminate our brilliant biomedical re-
search and development enterprise, I
would not support it.
Nothing could be further from the
truth. The truth is that much of our
drug innovation starts with our own
government-funded research paid for
by the taxpayers either at the National
Institutes of Health or at our great re-
search universities, two of which I have
led.
This bill provides critical additional
investments in NIH. $10 billion will ex-
tend research investments in projects
like Cancer Moonshot to accelerate
cancer research and make more thera-
pies available to more patients. It will
also help fund innovation and research
for rare diseases and fighting anti-
microbial resistance, which currently
kills 35,000 Americans per year.
This bill also makes explicit that
pharmaceutical companies should be
able to recoup the costs of research and
development and still make a profit.
Nine out of 10 Big Pharma companies
spend more on marketing, sales, and
overhead than research. Maybe they
won’t be making as big of a profit as
they currently do because they will no
longer be able to take the American
people to the cleaners, but they will
make a substantial profit.
Medicare will continue to cover all
the drugs they cover today so that pa-
tients’ choices will not be limited.
Rather, patients’ choices will be ex-
panded. Patients will no longer be leav-
ing drugs behind at the pharmacy
counter because they can’t afford
them.
It is time to end sky-high drug
prices. It is also time to reform Medi-
care benefits for the 21st century. This
bill does exactly that by finally adding
vision, dental, and hearing benefits to
the Medicare program.
Seniors have been asking for this for
a long time, and the quality of life of
millions of Medicare beneficiaries will
improve with access to these benefits.
I also look forward to the passage of
the Farm Workforce Modernization Act
and the conference report for the
NDAA. These are bipartisan pieces of
legislation that will improve our na-
tional security and the lives of families
and workers across this Nation.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on
the rule and the previous question.
The material previously referred to
by Mr. BURGESS is as follows:

So the previous question was ordered.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
PERSONAL EXPLANATION
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I was present
but my vote did not register on rollcall No. 668
on December 11, 2019 due to a machine mal-
function. I voted by inserting my machine card
into the machine with several minutes remain-
ing. The system apparently did not record my
‘‘yea’’ vote. I was present on the House floor
for the duration of the vote. Had my vote been
recorded, it would have been recorded as
‘‘yea.’’

NETTA). The question is on the resolu-
tion.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, on that
I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.

vice, and there were—yeas 222, nays

tering the United States after the date of intro-
duction of this Act; and

occurring on the same date, and not arising out
of the same act, omission, or scheme of mis-
conduct.

212(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act
(8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)), unless inadmissibility is
based on a conviction that would otherwise

Secretary shall establish special procedures to
properly credit work in cases in which an alien
was employed under an assumed name.

of proof under subsection (a) by producing suf-
ficient evidence to show the extent of such em-
ployment as a matter of just and reasonable in-
ference. Such evidence may include—

sive, binding, or admissible in a separate or sub-
sequent judicial or administrative action or pro-
ceeding between the alien and a current or prior
employer of the alien or any other party.
SEC. 127. EMPLOYER PROTECTIONS.

tural worker status under subtitle A shall not
violate section 274A(a)(2) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1324a(a)(2)) by

ment in support of an application for certified
agricultural worker status or adjustment of sta-
tus under this title shall not be subject to civil

such labor or services will not adversely affect
the wages and working conditions of workers in
the United States who are similarly employed.
‘‘(b) H–2A PETITION REQUIREMENTS.—An em-
ployer filing a petition for an H–2A worker to

test to and demonstrate compliance, as and
when appropriate, with all applicable require-
ments under this section, including the fol-
lowing:
‘‘(1) NEED FOR LABOR OR SERVICES.—The em-
ployer has described the need for agricultural
labor or services in a job order that includes a
description of the nature and location of the
work to be performed, the anticipated period or
periods (expected start and end dates) for which
the workers will be needed, and the number of
job opportunities in which the employer seeks to
employ the workers.
‘‘(2) NONDISPLACEMENT OF UNITED STATES
WORKERS.—The employer has not and will not
displace United States workers employed by the
employer during the period of employment of the
H–2A worker and during the 60-day period im-

in the job for which the employer seeks approval
to employ the H–2A worker.
‘‘(3) STRIKE OR LOCKOUT.—Each place of em-
ployment described in the petition is not, at the
time of filing the petition and until the petition

United States worker only for lawful, job-re-
lated reasons.
‘‘(5) WAGES, BENEFITS, AND WORKING CONDI-
TIONS.—The employer shall offer and provide, at
a minimum, the wages, benefits, and working
conditions required by this section to the H–2A
worker and all workers who are similarly em-
ployed. The employer—
‘‘(A) shall offer such similarly employed work-
ers not less than the same benefits, wages, and

‘‘(B) may not impose on such similarly em-
ployed workers any restrictions or obligations
that will not be imposed on the H–2A worker.

which will provide benefits at least equal to
those provided under the State workers’ com-
pensation law.

MENT LAWS.—The employer shall comply with
all applicable Federal, State and local employ-
ment-related laws and regulations.

‘‘(A) JOB ORDER.—As provided in subsection
(h)(1), the employer shall complete a job order
for posting on the electronic job registry main-
tained by the Secretary of Labor and for dis-
tribution by the appropriate State workforce
agency. Such posting shall remain on the job
registry as an active job order through the pe-
riod described in paragraph (2)(B).
‘‘(B) FORMER WORKERS.—At least 45 days be-
fore each start date identified in the petition,
the employer shall—
‘‘(i) make reasonable efforts to contact any
United States worker the employer employed in
the previous year in the same occupation and
area of intended employment for which an H–2A
worker is sought (excluding workers who were
terminated for cause or abandoned the work-
site); and
‘‘(ii) post such job opportunity in a con-
spicuous location or locations at the place of
employment.
‘‘(C) POSITIVE RECRUITMENT.—During the pe-
riod of recruitment, the employer shall complete
any other positive recruitment steps within a
multi-State region of traditional or expected
labor supply where the Secretary of Labor finds
that there are a significant number of qualified
United States workers who, if recruited, would
be willing to make themselves available for work
at the time and place needed.
‘‘(2) PERIOD OF RECRUITMENT.—
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this sub-
section, the period of recruitment begins on the
date on which the job order is posted on the on-
line job registry and ends on the date that H–2A
workers depart for the employer’s place of em-
ployment. For a petition involving more than 1
start date under subsection (h)(1)(C), the end of
the period of recruitment shall be determined by
the date of departure of the H–2A workers for
the final start date identified in the petition.
‘‘(B) REQUIREMENT TO HIRE US WORKERS.—
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding the limita-
tions of subparagraph (A), the employer will

job opportunity has elapsed; or
‘‘(bb) if the employer is a labor contractor, 50
percent of the work contract for the job oppor-
tunity has elapsed.
‘‘(ii) STAGGERED ENTRY.—For a petition in-
volving more than 1 start date under subsection
(h)(1)(C), each start date designated in the peti-
tion shall establish a separate job opportunity.
An employer may not reject a United States
worker because the worker is unable or unwill-
ing to fill more than 1 job opportunity included
in the petition.
‘‘(iii) EXCEPTION.—Notwithstanding clause (i),
the employer may offer a job opportunity to an
H-2A worker instead of an alien granted cer-
tified agricultural worker status under title I of

ployer in each of 3 years during the most recent
4-year period.

‘‘(B) BURDEN OF PROOF.—If the employer as-
serts that any eligible individual who has ap-
plied or been referred is not able, willing or

proof to establish that the individual is not able,
willing or qualified because of a lawful, employ-
ment-related reason.
‘‘(d) WAGE REQUIREMENTS.—

section will offer the worker, during the period
of authorized employment, wages that are at

cessor wage established under paragraph (7));
‘‘(C) the prevailing wage (hourly wage or
piece rate); or
‘‘(D) the Federal or State minimum wage.
‘‘(2) ADVERSE EFFECT WAGE RATE DETERMINA-
TIONS.—
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided under
subparagraph (B), the applicable adverse effect
wage rate for each State and occupational clas-
sification for a calendar year shall be as fol-

occupational classification in the State or region
as reported by the Secretary of Agriculture
based on a wage survey conducted by such Sec-
retary.

is not reported, the Statewide annual average
hourly wage for the standard occupational clas-
sification as reported by the Secretary of Labor

‘‘(B) LIMITATIONS ON WAGE FLUCTUATIONS.—
‘‘(i) WAGE FREEZE FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2020.—
For calendar year 2020, the adverse effect wage
rate for each State and occupational classifica-
tion under this subsection shall be the adverse
effect wage rate that was in effect for H–2A
workers in the applicable State in calendar year
2019.
‘‘(ii) CALENDAR YEARS 2021 THROUGH 2029.—For
each of calendar years 2021 through 2029, the
adverse effect wage rate for each State and oc-
cupational classification under this subsection
shall be the wage calculated under subpara-
graph (A), except that such wage may not—
‘‘(I) be more than 1.5 percent lower than the
wage in effect for H–2A workers in the applica-
ble State and occupational classification in the
immediately preceding calendar year;
‘‘(II) except as provided in clause (III), be
more than 3.25 percent higher than the wage in
effect for H–2A workers in the applicable State
and occupational classification in the imme-
diately preceding calendar year; and
‘‘(III) if the application of clause (II) results
in a wage that is lower than 110 percent of the
applicable Federal or State minimum wage, be
more than 4.25 percent higher than the wage in
effect for H–2A workers in the applicable State
and occupational classification in the imme-
diately preceding calendar year.
‘‘(iii) CALENDAR YEARS AFTER 2029.—For any
calendar year after 2029, the applicable wage
rate described in paragraph (1)(B) shall be the
wage rate established pursuant to paragraph
(7)(D). Until such wage rate is effective, the ad-
verse effect wage rate for each State and occu-
pational classification under this subsection
shall be the wage calculated under subpara-
graph (A), except that such wage may not be
more than 1.5 percent lower or 3.25 percent
higher than the wage in effect for H–2A workers
in the applicable State and occupational classi-
fication in the immediately preceding calendar
year.
‘‘(3) MULTIPLE OCCUPATIONS.—If the primary
job duties for the job opportunity described in
the petition do not fall within a single occupa-
tional classification, the applicable wage rates
under subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph
(1) for the job opportunity shall be based on the
highest such wage rates for all applicable occu-
pational classifications.
‘‘(4) PUBLICATION; WAGES IN EFFECT.—
‘‘(A) PUBLICATION.—Prior to the start of each
calendar year, the Secretary of Labor shall pub-
lish the applicable adverse effect wage rate (or
successor wage rate, if any), and prevailing
wage if available, for each State and occupa-
tional classification through notice in the Fed-
eral Register.
‘‘(B) JOB ORDERS IN EFFECT.—Except as pro-
vided in subparagraph (C), publication by the
Secretary of Labor of an updated adverse effect
wage rate or prevailing wage for a State and oc-
cupational classification shall not affect the
wage rate guaranteed in any approved job order
for which recruitment efforts have commenced
at the time of publication.
‘‘(C) EXCEPTION FOR YEAR-ROUND JOBS.—If
the Secretary of Labor publishes an updated ad-
verse effect wage rate or prevailing wage for a
State and occupational classification concerning
a petition described in subsection (i), and the
updated wage is higher than the wage rate
guaranteed in the work contract, the employer
shall pay the updated wage not later than 14
days after publication of the updated wage in
the Federal Register.
‘‘(5) WORKERS PAID ON A PIECE RATE OR OTHER
INCENTIVE BASIS.—If an employer pays by the
piece rate or other incentive method and re-
quires 1 or more minimum productivity stand-
ards as a condition of job retention, such stand-
ards shall be specified in the job order and shall
be no more than those normally required (at the
time of the first petition for H–2A workers) by
other employers for the activity in the area of
intended employment, unless the Secretary of
Labor approves a higher minimum standard re-
sulting from material changes in production
methods.
‘‘(6) GUARANTEE OF EMPLOYMENT.—
‘‘(A) OFFER TO WORKER.—The employer shall
guarantee the worker employment for the hour-
ly equivalent of at least three-fourths of the
work days of the total period of employment, be-
ginning with the first work day after the arrival
of the worker at the place of employment and
ending on the date specified in the job offer. For
purposes of this subparagraph, the hourly
equivalent means the number of hours in the
work days as stated in the job offer and shall
exclude the worker’s Sabbath and Federal holi-
days. If the employer affords the worker less em-
ployment than that required under this para-
graph, the employer shall pay the worker the
amount which the worker would have earned
had the worker, in fact, worked for the guaran-
teed number of hours.
‘‘(B) FAILURE TO WORK.—Any hours which
the worker fails to work, up to a maximum of
the number of hours specified in the job offer for
a work day, when the worker has been offered
an opportunity to do so, and all hours of work
actually performed (including voluntary work
in excess of the number of hours specified in the
job offer in a work day, on the worker’s Sab-
bath, or on Federal holidays) may be counted by
the employer in calculating whether the period
of guaranteed employment has been met.
‘‘(C) ABANDONMENT OF EMPLOYMENT; TERMI-
NATION FOR CAUSE.—If the worker voluntarily
abandons employment without good cause be-
fore the end of the contract period, or is termi-
nated for cause, the worker is not entitled to the
guarantee of employment described in subpara-
graph (A).
‘‘(D) CONTRACT IMPOSSIBILITY.—If, before the
expiration of the period of employment specified
in the job offer, the services of the worker are no
longer required for reasons beyond the control
of the employer due to any form of natural dis-
aster before the guarantee in subparagraph (A)
is fulfilled, the employer may terminate the
worker’s employment. In the event of such ter-
mination, the employer shall fulfill the employ-
ment guarantee in subparagraph (A) for the
work days that have elapsed from the first work
day after the arrival of the worker to the termi-
nation of employment. The employer shall make
efforts to transfer a worker to other comparable
employment acceptable to the worker. If such
transfer is not effected, the employer shall pro-
vide the return transportation required in sub-
section (f)(2).
‘‘(7) WAGE STANDARDS AFTER 2029.—
‘‘(A) STUDY OF ADVERSE EFFECT WAGE RATE.—
Beginning in fiscal year 2026, the Secretary of
Agriculture and Secretary of Labor shall jointly
conduct a study that addresses—
‘‘(i) whether the employment of H–2A workers
has depressed the wages of United States farm
workers;
‘‘(ii) whether an adverse effect wage rate is
necessary to protect the wages of United States
farm workers in occupations in which H–2A
workers are employed;
‘‘(iii) whether alternative wage standards
would be sufficient to prevent wages in occupa-
tions in which H–2A workers are employed from
falling below the wage level that would have
prevailed in the absence of H–2A employment;
‘‘(iv) whether any changes are warranted in
the current methodologies for calculating the
adverse effect wage rate and the prevailing
wage rate; and
‘‘(v) recommendations for future wage protec-
tion under this section.
‘‘(B) FINAL REPORT.—Not later than October
1, 2027, the Secretary of Agriculture and Sec-
retary of Labor shall jointly prepare and submit
a report to the Congress setting forth the find-
ings of the study conducted under subpara-
graph (A) and recommendations for future wage
protections under this section.
‘‘(C) CONSULTATION.—In conducting the study
under subparagraph (A) and preparing the re-
port under subparagraph (B), the Secretary of
Agriculture and Secretary of Labor shall consult
with representatives of agricultural employers
and an equal number of representatives of agri-
cultural workers, at the national, State and
local level.
‘‘(D) WAGE DETERMINATION AFTER 2029.—Upon
publication of the report described in subpara-
graph (B), the Secretary of Labor, in consulta-
tion with and the approval of the Secretary of
Agriculture, shall make a rule to establish a
process for annually determining the wage rate
for purposes of paragraph (1)(B) for fiscal years
after 2029. Such process shall be designed to en-
sure that the employment of H-2A workers does
not undermine the wages and working condi-
tions of similarly employed United States work-
ers.
‘‘(e) HOUSING REQUIREMENTS.—Employers
shall furnish housing in accordance with regu-
lations established by the Secretary of Labor.
Such regulations shall be consistent with the
following:

the absence of applicable local standards, State
standards for rental and/or public accommoda-
tions or other substantially similar class of habi-
tation shall be met: Provided further, That in
the absence of applicable local or State stand-
ards, Federal temporary labor camp standards
shall apply.

sion of such worker.
‘‘(B) TIMELY INSPECTION.—The Secretary of
Labor shall provide a process for—

the worker traveled from such place) to the
place of employment.
‘‘(2) TRAVEL FROM PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT.—
For a worker who completes the period of em-
ployment specified in the job order or who is ter-
minated without cause, the employer shall pro-
vide or pay for the worker’s transportation and
subsistence from the place of employment to the
place from which the worker, disregarding inter-
vening employment, came to work for the em-
ployer, or to the place of next employment, if
the worker has contracted with a subsequent
employer who has not agreed to provide or pay
for the worker’s transportation and subsistence
to such subsequent employer’s place of employ-
ment.
‘‘(3) LIMITATION.—
‘‘(A) AMOUNT OF REIMBURSEMENT.—Except as
provided in subparagraph (B), the amount of re-
imbursement provided under paragraph (1) or
(2) to a worker need not exceed the lesser of—
‘‘(i) the actual cost to the worker of the trans-
portation and subsistence involved; or
‘‘(ii) the most economical and reasonable com-
mon carrier transportation charges and subsist-
ence costs for the distance involved.
‘‘(B) DISTANCE TRAVELED.—For travel to or

distance between the worker’s home and the rel-
evant consulate is 50 miles or less, reimburse-
ment for transportation and subsistence may be
based on transportation to or from the con-
sulate.
‘‘(g) HEAT ILLNESS PREVENTION PLAN.—
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The employer shall main-

end date;
‘‘(III) no more than 120 days separate the first

the job opportunity identified in the petition.
‘‘(ii) LABOR CONTRACTORS.—A labor con-
tractor may not file a petition described in
clause (i) unless the labor contractor—

section, or the revocation of such a certification.
Such procedure shall require the Secretary to
expeditiously, but no later than 72 hours after
expedited review is requested, issue a de novo
determination on a labor certification that was
denied in whole or in part because of the avail-
ability of able, willing and qualified workers if

amending a request for labor certification in
conjunction with an H–2A petition, subsequent
to certification by the Secretary of Labor, in
cases in which the requested amendment does
not materially change the petition (including
the job order).
‘‘(4) ROLES OF AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATIONS.—
‘‘(A) MEMBER’S VIOLATION DOES NOT NEC-
ESSARILY DISQUALIFY ASSOCIATION OR OTHER
MEMBERS.—If an individual producer member of
a joint employer association is determined to
have committed an act that results in the denial
of a petition with respect to the member, the de-
nial shall apply only to that member of the asso-
ciation unless the Secretary of Labor determines
that the association or other member partici-
pated in, had knowledge of, or reason to know
of, the violation.
‘‘(B) ASSOCIATION’S VIOLATION DOES NOT NEC-
ESSARILY DISQUALIFY MEMBERS.—
‘‘(i) If an association representing agricul-
tural producers as a joint employer is deter-
mined to have committed an act that results in

between an employer and any labor contractor
or any foreign labor recruiter (or any agent of

retary of Labor finds, after notice and oppor-
tunity for a hearing, that the employer failed to
comply with the requirements of this section or

tions, or job opportunities of United States farm
workers;
(2) whether, and the manner in which, the ad-
verse effect wage rate increases or decreases
wages on United States farms, broken down by
geographic region and farm size;

verse effect wage rate varies based on the per-
centage of workers in a geographic region that
are H–2A workers;

wage rate is affected by the inclusion in wage
surveys of piece rate compensation, bonus pay-
ments, and other pay incentives, and whether

Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Agri-
culture, shall maintain an online electronic
platform to connect portable H–2A workers with
registered agricultural employers seeking work-
ers to perform temporary or seasonal agricul-
tural labor or services. Employers shall post on
the platform available job opportunities, includ-
ing a description of the nature and location of
the work to be performed, the anticipated period
or periods of need, and the terms and conditions
of employment. Such platform shall allow port-
able H–2A workers to search for available job
opportunities using relevant criteria, including
the types of jobs needed to be filled and the
dates and locations of need.
(3) LIMITATION.—Notwithstanding the
issuance of the regulation described in para-
graph (1), the Secretary of State may not issue
a portable H–2A visa and the Secretary of
Homeland Security may not confer portable H–
2A status on any alien until the Secretary of
Homeland Security, in consultation with the
Secretary of Labor and Secretary of Agriculture,
has determined that a sufficient number of em-
ployers have been designated as registered agri-
cultural employers under subsection (b)(1) and

tunity is not covered by or is exempt from the
State workers’ compensation law, a registered
agricultural employer shall provide, at no cost
to the worker, insurance covering injury and
disease arising out of, and in the course of, the
worker’s employment, which will provide bene-
fits at least equal to those provided under the
State workers’ compensation law.
(2) DESIGNATED WORKERS.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Individuals who have been
previously admitted to the United States in H–
2A status, and maintained such status during
the period of admission, shall be provided the

tus if the Secretary determines that there are an
insufficient number of registered agricultural
employers or job opportunities to support the
employment of all such portable H–2A workers.

cessation of employment with a registered agri-
cultural employer, a portable H–2A worker shall
have 60 days to secure new employment with a
registered agricultural employer.
(E) MAINTENANCE OF STATUS.—A portable H–
2A worker who does not secure new employment
with a registered agricultural employer within
60 days shall be considered to have failed to
maintain such status and shall depart the
United States or be subject to removal under sec-
tion 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Na-
tionality Act (8 U.S.C. 1188(a)(1)(C)(i)).

tions and random audits of employers to ensure
compliance with the employment-related re-
quirements of this section, consistent with sec-
tion 218(m) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act (8 U.S.C. 1188(m)). The Secretary of Labor

‘‘SEC. 274E. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ELEC-
TRONIC VERIFICATION OF EMPLOY-
MENT ELIGIBILITY.
‘‘(a) EMPLOYMENT ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION
SYSTEM.—
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Homeland
Security (referred to in this section as the ‘Sec-
retary’) shall establish and administer an elec-
tronic verification system (referred to in this sec-
tion as the ‘System’), patterned on the E–Verify
Program described in section 403(a) of the Illegal
Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsi-
bility Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1324a note) (as in ef-
fect on the day before the effective date de-
scribed in section 303(a)(4) of the Farm Work-
force Modernization Act of 2019), and using the
employment eligibility confirmation system es-
tablished under section 404 of such Act (8 U.S.C.
1324a note) (as so in effect) as a foundation,
through which the Secretary shall—
‘‘(A) respond to inquiries made by persons or
entities seeking to verify the identity and em-
ployment authorization of individuals that such
persons or entities seek to hire, or to recruit or
refer for a fee, for employment in the United
States; and
‘‘(B) maintain records of the inquiries that
were made, and of verifications provided (or not
provided) to such persons or entities as evidence
of compliance with the requirements of this sec-
tion.
‘‘(2) INITIAL RESPONSE DEADLINE.—The System
shall provide confirmation or a tentative non-
confirmation of an individual’s identity and em-
ployment authorization as soon as practicable,
but not later than 3 calendar days after the ini-
tial inquiry.
‘‘(3) GENERAL DESIGN AND OPERATION OF SYS-
TEM.—The Secretary shall design and operate
the System—
‘‘(A) using responsive web design and other
technologies to maximize its ease of use and ac-
cessibility for users on a variety of electronic de-
vices and screen sizes, and in remote locations;
‘‘(B) to maximize the accuracy of responses to
inquiries submitted by persons or entities;
‘‘(C) to maximize the reliability of the System
and to register each instance when the System is
unable to receive inquiries;
‘‘(D) to protect the privacy and security of the
personally identifiable information maintained
by or submitted to the System;
‘‘(E) to provide direct notification of an in-
quiry to an individual with respect to whom the
inquiry is made, including the results of such
inquiry, and information related to the process
for challenging the results, in cases in which the
individual has established a user account as de-
scribed in paragraph (4)(B) or an electronic mail
address for the individual is submitted by the
person or entity at the time the inquiry is made;
and
‘‘(F) to maintain appropriate administrative,
technical, and physical safeguards to prevent
misuse of the System and unfair immigration-re-
lated employment practices.
‘‘(4) MEASURES TO PREVENT IDENTITY THEFT
AND OTHER FORMS OF FRAUD.—To prevent iden-
tity theft and other forms of fraud, the Sec-
retary shall design and operate the System with
the following attributes:
‘‘(A) PHOTO MATCHING TOOL.—The System
shall display the digital photograph of the indi-
vidual, if any, that corresponds to the document
presented by an individual to establish identity
and employment authorization so that the per-
son or entity that makes an inquiry can com-
pare the photograph displayed by the System to
the photograph on the document presented by
the individual.
‘‘(B) INDIVIDUAL MONITORING AND SUSPENSION
OF IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.—The System
shall enable individuals to establish user ac-
counts, after authentication of an individual’s
identity, that would allow an individual to—
‘‘(i) confirm the individual’s own employment
authorization;
‘‘(ii) receive electronic notification when the
individual’s social security account number or
other personally identifying information has
been submitted to the System;
‘‘(iii) monitor the use history of the individ-
ual’s personally identifying information in the
System, including the identities of all persons or
entities that have submitted such identifying in-
formation to the System, the date of each query
run, and the System response for each query
run;
‘‘(iv) suspend or limit the use of the individ-
ual’s social security account number or other
personally identifying information for purposes
of the System; and
‘‘(v) provide notice to the Department of
Homeland Security of any suspected identity
fraud or other improper use of personally identi-
fying information.
‘‘(C) BLOCKING MISUSED SOCIAL SECURITY AC-
COUNT NUMBERS.—

tion with the Commissioner of Social Security
(referred to in this section as the ‘Commis-
sioner’), shall develop, after publication in the

comment, a process in which social security ac-
count numbers that have been identified to be
subject to unusual multiple use in the System or
that are otherwise suspected or determined to
have been compromised by identity fraud or
other misuse, shall be blocked from use in the
System unless the individual using such number
is able to establish, through secure and fair pro-
cedures, that the individual is the legitimate
holder of the number.
‘‘(ii) NOTICE.—If the Secretary blocks or sus-
pends a social security account number under
this subparagraph, the Secretary shall provide
notice to the persons or entities that have made
inquiries to the System using such account num-
ber that the identity and employment authoriza-
tion of the individual who provided such ac-
count number must be re-verified.

TOOL.—The Secretary shall develop, after publi-
cation in the Federal Register and an oppor-
tunity for public comment, additional security
measures to adequately verify the identity of an
individual whose identity may not be verified
using the photo tool described in subparagraph
(A). Such additional security measures—
‘‘(i) shall be kept up-to-date with techno-
logical advances; and
‘‘(ii) shall be designed to provide a high level
of certainty with respect to identity authentica-
tion.

retary, in consultation with the Commissioner,
shall establish a reliable, secure program
through which parents or legal guardians may
suspend or limit the use of the social security

‘‘(II) PROHIBITION ON TERMINATION.—In no
case shall a person or entity terminate employ-
ment or take any adverse employment action
against an individual for failure to obtain con-
firmation of the individual’s identity and em-
ployment authorization until the person or enti-
ty receives a notice of final nonconfirmation
from the System. Nothing in this subclause shall
prohibit an employer from terminating the em-
ployment of the individual for any other lawful
reason.
‘‘(III) CONFIRMATION OR FINAL NONCONFIRMA-
TION.—The Secretary, in consultation with the
Commissioner, shall issue notice of a confirma-
tion or final nonconfirmation of the individual’s
identity and employment authorization not later
than 30 calendar days after the date the Sec-
retary receives notice from the individual con-
testing the tentative nonconfirmation.
‘‘(E) FINAL NONCONFIRMATION.—
‘‘(i) NOTICE.—If a person or entity receives a
final nonconfirmation of an individual’s iden-
tity or employment authorization, the person or
entity shall, not later than 3 business days after
receipt, notify such individual of the final non-
confirmation in writing, on a form designated
by the Secretary, which shall include informa-
tion regarding the individual’s right to appeal
the final nonconfirmation as provided under
subparagraph (F). The person or entity shall at-
test, under penalty of perjury, that the person
or entity provided (or attempted to provide) the
notice to the individual, and the individual
shall acknowledge receipt of such notice in a
manner designated by the Secretary.
‘‘(ii) TERMINATION OR NOTIFICATION OF CON-
TINUED EMPLOYMENT.—If a person or entity re-
ceives a final nonconfirmation regarding an in-
dividual, the person or entity may terminate em-
ployment of the individual. If the person or en-
tity does not terminate such employment pend-
ing appeal of the final nonconfirmation, the
person or entity shall notify the Secretary of
such fact through the System. Failure to notify
the Secretary in accordance with this clause
shall be deemed a violation of section
274A(a)(1)(A).
‘‘(iii) PRESUMPTION OF VIOLATION FOR CONTIN-
UED EMPLOYMENT.—If a person or entity con-
tinues to employ an individual after receipt of a
final nonconfirmation, there shall be a rebut-
table presumption that the person or entity has
violated paragraphs (1)(A) and (a)(2) of section
274A(a).
‘‘(F) APPEAL OF FINAL NONCONFIRMATION.—
‘‘(i) ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL.—The Secretary,
in consultation with the Commissioner, shall de-
velop a process by which an individual may seek
administrative review of a final nonconfirma-
tion. Such process shall—
‘‘(I) permit the individual to submit additional
evidence establishing identity or employment
authorization;
‘‘(II) ensure prompt resolution of an appeal
(but in no event shall there be a failure to re-
spond to an appeal within 30 days); and
‘‘(III) permit the Secretary to impose a civil
money penalty (not to exceed $500) on an indi-
vidual upon finding that an appeal was frivo-
lous or filed for purposes of delay.
‘‘(ii) COMPENSATION FOR LOST WAGES RESULT-
ING FROM GOVERNMENT ERROR OR OMISSION.—
‘‘(I) IN GENERAL.—If, upon consideration of
an appeal of a final nonconfirmation, the Sec-
retary determines that the final nonconfirma-
tion was issued in error, the Secretary shall fur-
ther determine whether the final nonconfirma-
tion was the result of government error or omis-
sion. If the Secretary determines that the final
nonconfirmation was solely the result of govern-
ment error or omission and the individual was
terminated from employment, the Secretary shall
compensate the individual for lost wages.
‘‘(II) CALCULATION OF LOST WAGES.—Lost
wages shall be calculated based on the wage
rate and work schedule that were in effect prior
to the individual’s termination. The individual
shall be compensated for lost wages beginning
on the first scheduled work day after employ-
ment was terminated and ending 90 days after
completion of the administrative review process
described in this subparagraph or the day the
individual is reinstated or obtains other employ-
ment, whichever occurs first.
‘‘(III) LIMITATION ON COMPENSATION.—No
compensation for lost wages shall be awarded
for any period during which the individual was
not authorized for employment in the United
States.
‘‘(IV) SOURCE OF FUNDS.—There is established
in the general fund of the Treasury, a separate
account which shall be known as the ‘Electronic
Verification Compensation Account’. Fees col-
lected under subsections (f) and (g) shall be de-
posited in the Electronic Verification Compensa-
tion Account and shall remain available for
purposes of providing compensation for lost
wages under this subclause.
‘‘(iii) JUDICIAL REVIEW.—Not later than 30
days after the dismissal of an appeal under this
subparagraph, an individual may seek judicial
review of such dismissal in the United States
District Court in the jurisdiction in which the
employer resides or conducts business.
‘‘(5) RETENTION OF VERIFICATION RECORDS.—
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—After completing the form
designated by the Secretary in accordance with
paragraphs (1) and (2), the person or entity
shall retain the form in paper, microfiche,
microfilm, electronic, or other format deemed ac-
ceptable by the Secretary, and make it available

mences and ending on the later of—

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 5038.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself 3 minutes.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5038, the Farm
Workforce Modernization Act, is vital
legislation that will address an issue of
critical national importance: the grow-
ing labor challenges damaging the
American agricultural sector.
Solving this issue is crucial not only
from an economic standpoint, but,
also, it is a matter of national secu-
rity. The less we grow our own food,
the more dependent we become on food
imports and the more vulnerable we be-
come to food contamination,
epidemics, fluctuating market prices,
and increased national debt.
Today, food imports account for ap-
proximately 32 percent of the fresh
vegetables and 55 percent of the fresh
fruit that we consume.
b 1445
Systemic labor challenges are one of
the main reasons for this increase in
agricultural imports.
The United States has seen a con-
tinuing decline in the number of family
farmworkers and fewer U.S. workers

are turning to farm work as their cho-
sen pursuit. As a result, most of to-
day’s hired farm laborers are foreign-
born.
Unfortunately, our immigration laws
have not been updated to reflect the
needs of our 21st century economy. Due
in large part to these outdated laws,
undocumented workers now comprise
about half of the farm workforce, but
they are living and working in a state
of uncertainty and fear, which contrib-
utes to the destabilization of farms
across the Nation.
H.R. 5038 addresses these challenges
head-on. The bill provides temporary
status to current farmworkers with an
optional path to a green card for those
who continue to work in agriculture.
The bill also addresses the Nation’s fu-
ture labor needs by modernizing the H–
2A temporary visa program while en-
suring fair wages and workplace condi-
tions for all farmworkers.
We have seen many attempts to solve
this issue through legislation while I
have been in Congress. I am pleased
that today, we finally have a bipar-
tisan, balanced solution, one that we
should all be able to support.
This bill is a victory for farmers who
have struggled with persistent labor
challenges for decades. It is also a vic-
tory for farmworkers, who have worked
tirelessly to grow and harvest food for
our Nation without proper labor pro-
tections or any guarantee that they
can remain in this country. No accept-
able solution can fail to deal with this
reality.
That is why H.R. 5038 is the right so-
lution. I hope my colleagues will find
the courage to vote today in favor of
providing a seat at America’s table for
those who are responsible for providing
the food that we serve on all our ta-
bles.
I thank the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LOFGREN), my friend and
colleague, and the chair of the Immi-
gration Subcommittee, for her leader-
ship and steadfast commitment to the
bipartisan process that led to today’s
vote on the Farm Workforce Mod-
ernization Act, and I urge all of my
colleagues to do what is right and to
support this bill.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.

Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask for
unanimous consent that the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. LOFGREN)

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.

quest of the gentleman from New
York?
There was no objection.
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
I rise to discuss the Farm Workforce
Modernization Act this afternoon.
As I said during last month’s Com-
mittee on the Judiciary markup, this
is an issue that is of great importance
to me and to my district in eastern
Colorado. Colorado is home to one of
the largest agricultural economies in
the country. I like to remind my col-
leagues, we have some of the best mel-
ons in the world in southeast Colorado,
and no one bypasses a good Colorado
steak, but to get this food to the table,
our farmers and ranchers need help.
I have heard countless times how our
farmers struggle to find reliable work-
ers to plant and harvest crops. As we
said during our committee markup, my
Republican colleagues and I are com-
mitted to crafting a solution that en-
sures our Nation’s agricultural employ-
ers have a stable labor supply.
I appreciate my friends’ work to
solve a clear problem, especially Chair-
person LOFGREN, Representative
NEWHOUSE, Representative PANETTA,
Representative LAMALFA, and many
other Members. I appreciate their ef-
forts to craft a solution that gives our
agricultural employers the labor, sup-
ply, and resources they need to keep
America the world’s breadbasket. But
this bill before us today is not the an-
swer.
My colleagues will tell you how they
have taken our concerns to heart and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H10068 December 11, 2019
have worked to make the bill better,
but this bill is still the same fun-
damentally flawed bill that came be-
fore us in the Committee on the Judici-
ary a few weeks ago. What is worse is
that House leadership put this bill on
the floor under a closed rule without
an amendment process. There are a
number of problems with the bill that
a rigorous debate and thoughtful
amendments could address, but that
will not be happening today.
Most notably, we don’t have the
slightest idea of how many individuals
this bill will put on a pathway to citi-
zenship. And while I would like to
think that all of our agricultural work-
ers are trustworthy, good people, we
don’t have any way to verify that be-
fore granting certified agricultural
work status.
The chairperson will assert that
aliens seeking status under the bill will
need to have a clean record in order to
be put on a pathway to citizenship, but
this simply is not true. H.R. 5038 allows
an illegal alien to receive certified ag-
ricultural worker status and get on a
pathway to citizenship even if they
have been convicted of two crimes in-
volving moral turpitude, controlled
substance violations, or if they were
involved in prostitution or trafficking.
The bill also permits an individual to
receive status after being convicted of
two misdemeanors with a third convic-
tion pending.
We saw the Democrats vote down an
amendment from Representative
CHABOT that would have made an alien
ineligible for amnesty if they are
charged with two DUI’s or one DUI
with an injury. You can’t tell me that
you are serious about ensuring only
people with clean records take advan-
tage of this system if you reject
amendments that bar criminals from
taking advantage of our system.
Additionally, H.R. 5038 allows indi-
viduals to apply for legal status and a
work permit, which is not limited to
agricultural industries, with little
more than an affidavit claiming that
the individual worked unlawfully in
this country for 1,035 hours or 180
workdays over the past 2 years. This
means applicants will have worked less
than 6 hours per day for less than 4
months over a 2-year period.
I appreciate that my colleagues
heard my concerns and changed the
overall standard for petitioning to a
higher standard preponderance of evi-
dence; however, the underlying provi-
sions haven’t changed. The bill still al-
lows an individual petitioning for sta-
tus to meet that preponderance burden
by providing documents, including
their own affidavit of work history as
long as those documents meet a just
and reasonable inference standard.
Let me remind everyone here that
existing case law finds that just and
reasonable inference standard essen-
tially requires adjudicators to accept a
petition based on nothing more than an
individual’s word. This is the same evi-
dentiary standard unsuccessfully used
in the 1986 special agricultural worker
legalization bill, which led to wide-
spread fraud, and even amnesty, for
one of the World Trade Center bomb-
ers. He wasn’t an agricultural worker
at all, but a taxi driver in New York
City.
Unfortunately, while I appreciate the
chairperson’s effort to work with me
here, this change won’t solve these
problems. My friends on the other side
of the aisle also rejected Representa-
tive ARMSTRONG’s amendment that
would specify that certified agricul-
tural workers would only be eligible to
work in agriculture. While the indi-
vidual may receive status as an agri-
cultural worker, there is no guarantee
that they won’t immediately find a job
in another industry as soon as possible.
Additionally, the bill does nothing to
stop potential Social Security fraud.
Individuals who have been fraudulently
using a valid Social Security number,
sometimes for many years, to obtain a
work status and benefits, will get off
without even so much as a slap on the
wrist.
Furthermore, this bill fails our adju-
dicators at USCIS by preventing them
from accessing the most comprehen-
sive background check databases when
determining whether an applicant for
certified agricultural worker status
poses a public safety risk. We need to
ensure our investigators have all the
information they need to ensure that
we are not allowing felons and violent
individuals to remain in the country.
The bill also provides a handout to
the trial attorneys and presents an in-
creased risk of litigation for agricul-
tural employers by giving H–2A work-
ers a Federal private right of action.
This provision ignores the current H–
2A program’s existing administrative
process to address employment claims
and fails to provide employers the op-
portunity to cure violations before a
suit may go forward. This is fundamen-
tally unfair to the hardworking farm-
ers, growers, and ranchers who care
about their employees.
I ask my colleagues: Would you pre-
fer having the problem fixed or you
just want to give trial attorneys an-
other opportunity to sue?
Finally, the bill fails to achieve the
desired results on a number of provi-
sions that have the potential to truly
help our agricultural employers. The
authors promised to streamline the ap-
plication process, address wage prob-
lems, and provide year-round indus-
tries a lasting labor solution. The bill
streamlines data entry for H–2A appli-
cations but does nothing to encourage
concurrent agency review of H–2A ap-
plications. This essentially speeds up
data entry but keeps the adjudication
process exactly the same.
I appreciate that my colleagues codi-
fied H–2A procedures and included a
pool of 20,000 visas for year-round in-
dustries, including dairy farmers and
sheep and goat herders, but this falls
far short of industry’s needs and fails
to fix the problematic version of exist-
ing law.
Once again, I am glad that my col-
leagues are trying to solve this prob-
lem. I truly want to support the farm-
ers, growers, dairymen, and ranchers in
my district and throughout the coun-
try. We need to find a solution that en-
sures our agricultural employers have
a reliable labor pool. My colleagues
and I want to strike an Ag labor agree-
ment; unfortunately, this bill is fatally
flawed, and I must oppose it in its cur-
rent form.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself 3 minutes.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
of this bill today. I am proud of the bi-
partisan work that was done to get us
to this point. Representatives
NEWHOUSE, SIMPSON, LAMALFA, DIAZ-
BALART, UPTON—so many others on the
Republican side—here: PANETTA, PE-
TERSON, CARBAJAL, COX, HARDER,
CORREA, COSTA, ESCOBAR—I better stop
because there are more people who
toiled on this legislation for almost a
year.
Now, it is not always easy to find
common ground even when you have a
common goal, but if you listen to each
other, if you work hard, you can get it
done. We have been several decades in
failing to accomplish anything in this
arena. This is a chance to solve a prob-
lem for America that needs a solution.
It is the product of bipartisan nego-
tiation, and I will say, also amongst
stakeholders. We have the United Farm
Workers Union meeting and discussing
points of concern with growers and
farmers all across the United States.
You know, I grew up in a union
household, and I was taught to respect
collective bargaining. And when it
comes to wages, hours, and working
conditions, the union and all those em-
ployers had a robust discussion, and
our bipartisan group decided to respect
the work that they put into it.
This bill is a compromise. It is not
exactly what I would have written, but
it does stabilize the workforce. We
have farmworkers who have been here
for a very long time without their pa-
pers, living in fear, and in some cases,
being arrested and deported. We need
to allow them to get an agricultural
worker visa that is temporary and re-
newable so they can do the work we
need them to do and that their employ-
ers need them to do.
We also need to stabilize the H–2A
program, which this bill does. It sim-
plifies and it also stabilizes wages. It is
a good solution and one of the things
we have always said—those of us who
think the immigration laws ought to
be reformed—is when you have a work-
able system, you ought to be willing to
enforce that system.
And so what we have in this bill is
when these agricultural reforms are
implemented, we will institute the E-
Verify program on the agricultural sec-
tor. And I think that is the right thing
to do.

committee has raised a couple of

issues, and I want to deal with them
just briefly. You know, we have robust
protections against criminality in this
bill. And I would like to note, that the
bars that we have put into this bill are
substantially more than was in the bill
proposed by Representative Goodlatte
that most Republicans voted for in the
last Congress. He didn’t have anything
additional. We do. We have security
bars; we have criminal bars that are
additional.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself an additional 15 seconds.
Mr. Speaker, any felony conviction,
any aggravated felony conviction,
more than two misdemeanors of any
kind, we have the ability in the De-
partment of Homeland Security to sim-
ply deny the visa if there is any con-
cern about the conduct of the appli-
cant.
Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. We
should support it, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCLINTOCK), my friend.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, history warns us that
nations which either cannot or will not
secure their borders simply aren’t
around very long. And if we will not
enforce our immigration laws, our bor-
ders mean nothing. America ceases to
become a unique nation and simply be-
comes a vast international territory
between Canada and Mexico.
Now, I understand agriculture’s need
for labor, especially in so tight a labor
market as our blossoming Trump econ-
omy has created. Years ago, the Bra-
cero program provided a means for sea-
sonal laborers to come to America, be
protected under our laws, and provided
with a powerful incentive to return in
the form of a significant financial de-
posit when the season ended, but that
program can only work when our im-
migration laws are being uniformly en-
forced.
Instead, this bill ignores enforcement
and rewards anyone who has illegally
crossed our borders, both with amnesty
and a special path to citizenship, as
long as they claim to have worked
part-time in the agriculture sector for
the last 2 years.
b 1500
It then rewards them with a pathway
to citizenship, allowing them to cut in
line in front of every legal immigrant
who has obeyed our laws, waited pa-
tiently in line, and done everything our
country has asked.
As a practical matter, we can expect
claimants will have very little or even
no scrutiny to the veracity of their
claims. We can expect that, once
achieving amnesty, they will then
leave the fields for higher-paid employ-
ment in direct competition with Amer-
ican workers. And we can expect a new
wave of illegal immigrants coming
here to take their places with the full
expectation that they too will ulti-
mately be rewarded with amnesty and
citizenship.
There is a much better way to re-
solve this issue. Secure our borders,
uniformly enforce our immigration
laws, and provide foreign seasonal
labor with the opportunity to work and
the incentive to return to their coun-
tries when that work is done. And if
they wish to become American citi-
zens, we ask that they follow the law,
as millions of legal immigrants have
done throughout our history.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I would
just note that we write the laws, and
we get to decide who can come and who
can’t come, and that is what this bill
does.
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), a mem-
ber of the Judiciary Committee.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for her leader-
ship. And having been the ranking
member of the Immigration and Citi-
zenship Subcommittee over the years, I
understand the momentous task and
the excellent work that has been done.
This bill does what Republicans have
always asked: For immigrants to work,
for people to seek status; it provides
status to hardworking agricultural
workers. It provides them a certified
agricultural worker status.
They undergo background checks and
pass strict criminal and national secu-
rity bars. They have the opportunity to
access the line to citizenship. They
don’t get in front of others. They are
protected from reckless deportation.
The industry is protected, the farm
industry, the production of food is pro-
tected.
I am delighted that my amendment
regarding temporary protected status
that impacts Hondurans, Haitians, and
others—and also, as I attempt to work
on TPS for our Guatemalan friends,
this bill ensures the fair way to deal
with farmworkers.
It stops the outrage of deportation. It
stops the outrage of threat, and it does
what Cesar Chavez says, that we can-
not have achievement and forget our
progress and prosperity for our commu-
nity. It honors their work.
I ask my colleagues to support H.R.
5038.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.
5038, the Agricultural Worker Program Act.
This legislation will stabilize the agricultural
sector and preserve our rural heritage by en-
suring that farmers can meet their labor needs
well into the future.
First, the bill establishes a program for agri-
cultural workers in the United States (and their
spouses and minor children) to earn legal sta-
tus through continued agricultural employment.
Specifically, the bill creates a process for
farm workers to seek Certified Agricultural
Worker status—a temporary status for those
who have worked at least 180 days in agri-
culture over the prior 2-year period.
Certified Agricultural Worker status can be
renewed indefinitely with continued farm work
(at least 100 days per year).
Applicants must undergo background
checks and pass strict criminal and national
security bars.
Dependent status is available for spouses
and minor children.
The bill does not require workers to do or
apply for anything else in order to stay and
work in the United States.
But long-term workers who want to stay
have the option of earning a path to lawful
permanent residence by paying a $1,000 fine
and engaging additional agricultural work, as
follows:
Workers with 10 years of agricultural work
prior to the date of enactment must complete
4 additional years of such work.
Workers with less than 10 years of agricul-
tural work prior to the date of enactment must
complete 8 additional years of such work.
The Farmworkers movement in this country
was started and led by a great leader, Cesar
Chavez who said, ‘‘We cannot seek achieve-
ment for ourselves and forget about progress
and prosperity for our community. Our ambi-
tions must be broad enough to include the as-
pirations and needs of others, for their sakes
and for our own.’’
The Texas Farm Workers Union (‘‘TFWU’’)
was established by Antonio Orendain and
farmworker leaders of the Rio Grande Valley
active with the United Farm Workers after a
disagreement with UFW leadership over direc-
tion of a melon strike in south McAllen, TX in
1975.
In August 1975, nearly ten years after he
began organizing farm workers for the United
Farm Workers in the Rio Grande Valley of
South Texas.
Orendain worked for Cesar Chavez in the
Chicago UFW national grape and lettuce boy-
cott office.
Farmworkers undertake some of the tough-
est jobs in America.
They have earned the opportunity to build
their lives without the fear of being uprooted
from their families and their communities.
The bipartisan Farm Workforce Moderniza-
tion Act empowers the economic and physical
well-being of immigrant families while pro-
viding much-needed labor security for our na-
tion’s farms.
The agricultural industry relies on the labor
of 2.4 million farmworkers—about half of
whom are undocumented.
This bill would protect thousands of families
from deportation.
With over 60 Democratic and Republican
cosponsors, the bill has garnered significant
bipartisan support.
This is a big step in making our immigration
system more humane and more efficient.
I know the farming and agricultural commu-
nities in the state of Texas farm and my dis-
trict borders communities that farm.
What we are doing here is the right thing
and attempting to reinforce the breadbasket
that the United States happens to be to the
world.
I have heard the clamoring of farm workers
for a very long time but I have also heard the
need for fairness and the improvement of con-
ditions that they are working in with adequate
compensation.
This bill regularizes people who want to be
regularized and who want to contribute to
helping the agricultural industry in this great
nation.
My amendment which I believe is a positive
addition to this legislation, to ensure that indi-
viduals with Temporary Protected Status

AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT IN THE NA-
TURE OF A SUBSTITUTE TO H.R. 5038 OFFERED
BY MS. JACKSON LEE OF TEXAS
Page 3, strike lines 19 through 21 and insert
the following:
(B) on the date of the introduction of this
Act—
(i) is inadmissible or deportable from the
United States; or
(ii) is under a grant of deferred enforced de-
parture or has temporary protected status
under section 244 of the Immigration and Na-
tionality Act.
I would like to thank Congresswoman
LOFGREN and her team for working with our of-
fice to insure that this would be a positive way
of making the point that individuals who are
around farming areas can continue to do great
work.
I would like to thank the organizations in-
volved in the assisting in crafting this amend-
ment, the United Farm Workers, UFW Foun-
dation and Farmworker Justice.
My amendment, and this bill, are about
doing the right thing. One important goal of
this legislation is to recognize the contributions
of farmworkers to our nation’s agricultural suc-
cess.
Individuals with TPS, from Haitian workers
in Florida to Honduran workers in California,
and those with DED, including UFW members
in Washington, are a key part of our nation’s
farmworkers.
We must afford those individuals with TPS
and DED the same opportunity to earn a more
secure temporary status and lawful permanent
residency as will be given to many of our na-
tion’s other farmworkers.
Many of these individuals have been living
in the U.S. for years and have U.S. citizen
children.
All they wanted to do was to get a pathway
to citizenship in a myriad of directions but in
particular, to do it legally.
Ensuring that farmworkers who have TPS
and DED are eligible to participate in the Farm
Workforce Modernization Act’s legalization
program is important to provide needed sta-
bility to this workforce.
Moreover, it necessary to further the legisla-
tion’s intent to stabilize the current agricultural
labor supply and to ensure that farmworkers
are able to join more fully the society that they
are helping to feed.
I would like to thank the Judiciary Com-
mittee, my colleagues, both Republican and
Democrat, and in particular, Chairman NADLER
and Ms. LOFGREN, who emphasized a very im-
portant point that this has been a year of
working together.
I am reminded of our tenure here on the Ju-
diciary Committee and I think we have at-
tempted to be fair and bipartisan on immigra-
tion reform for at least 2 decades.
I am also reminded of the legislation that
came from the Senate, led by the late Senator
John McCain that was a bipartisan bill that at-
tempted to respond to the issues of undocu-
mented persons.
UNITED FARM WORKERS SUPPORT FOR THE
FARM WORKFORCE MODERNIZATION ACT
(H.R. 5038—LOFGREN)
The United Farm Workers of America sup-
ports the bipartisan Farm Workforce Mod-
ernization Act (H.R. 5038). We were proud to
join the bipartisan group of members of Con-
gress and the major grower associations to
develop and support H.R. 5038. It is cruelly
ironic that the people who feed the United
States live in a deep, all-encompassing fear
that they themselves cannot provide food for
their families. The human cost and stress for
farm workers and their families as they live
in fear of deportation and harassment due to
our broken immigration system threatens
our nation’s food supply and is a source of
great shame for our nation. The compromise
legislation authored by Representatives
LOFGREN, cosponsored by a bipartisan, di-
verse group of over 50 members of the House,
and endorsed by the Congressional Hispanic
Caucus will go a long way towards improving
the lives of farm workers today and in the
future, and our broken immigration system.
We support H.R. 5038 for a simple reason—
it will make the lives of all farm workers
better. H.R. 5038 meets the following basic
principles:
1. Equality of Treatment—the new agricul-
tural visa program will allow farm workers
and their families to have the same rights
and protections as current U.S. farm work-
ers.
2. No Discrimination—the program does
not create major incentives to discriminate
against U.S. workers (including newly legal-
ized workers).
3. Fairness in pay—the pay rates protect
U.S. workers and supports predictable pay
increases.
4. Eligibility to earn permanent resi-
dence—no one that works to feed our coun-
try should be condemned to permanent sec-
ond class status. H.R. 5038 changes our cur-
rent immoral system.
You have the ability to pass H.R. 5038. If
H.R. 5038 becomes law, agricultural workers
will have stability for themselves, and their
families and the agricultural industry.
Please vote YES on H.R. 5038.
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. NEWHOUSE).
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I want
to thank my good friend from Colorado
for yielding me time.
Mr. Speaker, if you talk to any farm-
er in this country, one of the biggest
issues that they will raise and some-
thing they are concerned with, is their
labor force, a secure and legal labor
force. And that is what brought to-
gether a bipartisan group of Members
of Congress, representatives from agri-
cultural groups around the country, as
well as agricultural labor groups
around the country, to come up with a
bill to deal with the labor situation
that we have in this country, to pro-
vide a certain legal labor force; some-
thing that is simple in saying that, but
very, very complex in order to get to
the solution.
So this has three titles. Number one
deals with the current workforce. We
have come up with something that the
President has asked for, a merit-based
system to provide legality to our cur-
rent workforce that requires a history
of ag labor; it requires fines because
people broke the law to get here; and it
requires people to stay engaged in the
agricultural industry.
Title two simply is to reform the H–
2A program, something that we des-
perately need. It makes it more respon-
sive, more efficient. It will cap the
ever-skyrocketing wage growth in this
country of the AEWR to 3.25 percent
per year. Some States next year are
facing a 91⁄2 percent increase.
On top of that, it will allow full-time
employers, like dairies, to be able to
take advantage and utilize the H–2A
program.
And third, it will require a phase-in
of the E-Verify system, something that
Republicans have wanted for a long
time, and something that I think will
remove an incentive for people to ille-
gally cross the border and will do a lot
to improve the security of our country.
This bill provides certainty for farm-
ers and farmworkers.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD
some letters of support from the Na-
tional Association of Counties, the
Chamber of Commerce of the United
States of America, the Americans for
Prosperity, the National Association of
State Departments of Agriculture, the
Committee on Migration, and included
in a letter to leadership, a list of over
300 agricultural organizations across
this great country in support of this
legislation.

Hon. NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY,
Minority Leader, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: The undersigned groups, rep-
resenting a broad cross-section of agri-
culture and its allies, urge you to advance
the Farm Workforce Modernization Act
(H.R. 5038) through the House to address the
labor crisis facing American agriculture. A
stable, legal workforce is needed to ensure
farmers and ranchers have the ability to con-
tinue producing an abundant, safe, and af-
fordable food supply.
The effects of agriculture’s critical short-
age of labor reach far beyond the farm gate,
negatively impacting our economic competi-
tiveness, local economies, and jobs. Econo-
mists have found that every farm worker en-
gaged in high-value, labor-intensive crop and
livestock production sustains two to three
off-farm jobs. As foreign producers take ad-
vantage of our labor shortage and gain mar-
ket share, America will export not only our
food production but also thousands of these
farm-dependent jobs. Securing a reliable and
skilled workforce is essential, not only for
the agricultural industry but for the U.S.
economy as a whole.
The House must pass legislation that pre-
serves agriculture’s experienced workforce
by allowing current farm workers to earn
legal status. For future needs, legislation
must include an agricultural worker visa
program that provides access to a legal and
reliable workforce moving forward. This visa
program needs to be more accessible, pre-
dictable, and flexible to meet the needs of
producers, including those with year-round
labor needs, such as dairy and livestock
which currently do not have meaningful ac-
cess to any program.
While the bill does include a few provisions
that raise significant concerns for the agri-
cultural community, we are committed to
working together throughout the legislative
process to fully address these issues. It is
vital to move the Farm Workforce Mod-
ernization Act (H.R. 5038) through the House
as a significant step in working to meet the

and affordable housing options for rural fam-
ilies and farm laborers. Unfortunately, fed-
eral regulations often are inflexible and too
restrictive to address the unique needs of our
rural communities. Much of our nation’s ex-
isting farm labor housing has also aged past
its useful life with severe physical problems,
including inadequate heating, plumbing and
space.
Additionally, we are encouraged by efforts
in this bill to modernize and simplify the H–
2A process and ensure that a reliable and ca-
pable workforce is available for the nation’s
farmers and ranchers. This bill would pro-
vide stability and consistency in our farm
labor force and create a realistic path for mi-
grant and seasonal farm workers to con-
tribute to the national economy.
We ask that you join us in support of the
Farm Work Modernization Act and help
strengthen our nation’s local agricultural
economies. Thank you for your time and
consideration on this important matter.

CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
October 30, 2019.
Washington, DC,
TO THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REP-
RESENTATIVES: The U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce supports the Farm Workforce Mod-
ernization Act, which would take important
steps to address the growing struggle of agri-
cultural employers to meet their workforce
needs.
The inability of American farmers to effec-
tively meet their workforce needs does not
affect the agricultural industry in a vacuum.
When crops rot in a field because farmers do
not have enough workers for the harvest,
this does not only harm the interests of that
farmer. These situations also negatively af-
fect the shipping company that would have
transported those products, and the retailers
that would have sold them.
Furthermore, the uncertainty caused by
the insufficient quantity of agricultural
workers in the U.S. has enabled foreign agri-
cultural producers to take advantage of this
situation and gain market share. American
agricultural producers will only become less
competitive in the global marketplace if
these workforce problems persist.
The Farm Workforce Modernization Act
seeks to provide workforce stability for agri-
cultural workers by allowing unauthorized
farm workers to earn legal status in the U.S.
This legislation also would address future
agricultural workforce needs by updating the
temporary agricultural worker program,
most notably providing eligibility to em-
ployers who have year-round labor needs,
which is critical for dairy and livestock. Fur-
thermore, the bill would enhance domestic
security by making the use of E-Verify man-
datory for employers seeking to hire tem-
porary agricultural workers.
This bill could benefit from further refine-
ment. The proposed prevailing wage levels
for temporary agricultural workers, as well
as the new annual visa quotas for year-round
agricultural employment, should be more re-
sponsive to market needs. In addition, the
transition period for agricultural employers
to utilize the E-Verify system should be ex-
tended in order for employers to better ad-
just to the new compliance burdens being
foisted upon them. We are committed to
working with members of both parties to ad-
dress these and other issues to improve the
bill as it proceeds through the legislative
process.
Sincerely,
NEIL L. BRADLEY,
Executive Vice President and Chief Policy
Officer.
AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY,

November 19, 2019.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of our or-
ganizations and the millions of activists we
represent, we applaud the bipartisan efforts
from lawmakers in the House of Representa-
tives on the Farm Workforce Modernization
Act of 2019. This bill represents a step in the
right direction by modernizing components
of our guest worker program and legal immi-
gration system. It will also help our country
better meet the needs of employers and guest
workers in the agricultural sector.
We are encouraged by lawmakers’ efforts
to streamline components of the H–2A pro-
gram aimed at reducing some of the burdens
imposed on employers and workers, in addi-
tion to considerable reforms that create new
legal channels which currently are not avail-
able.
While the legislation is not perfect, the bill
represents an important step forward to im-
prove the way we issue temporary visas for
guest workers and green cards for aspiring
immigrants. We look forward to working
with members to improve this bill by further
reducing unnecessary barriers that impede
upon the ability for employers and employ-
ees to freely contract in a mutually bene-
ficial manner.
With only a few legislative days remaining,
we urge lawmakers to continue working to-
gether to modernize and improve our guest
worker program and stand ready to partner
with lawmakers to accomplish this goal.

Re Support for the Farm Workforce Mod-
ernization Act.
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN LOFGREN AND CONGRESS-
MAN NEWHOUSE: The Farm Workforce Mod-
ernization Act (FWMA) is a crucial step for-
ward towards solving agriculture’s need for
labor. NASDA thanks you for your hard
work negotiating and finding compromises
on a bipartisan bill that will successfully in-
crease access to farm labor across the coun-
try. Foreign-born workers are an essential
part of the U.S. agriculture workforce and an
estimated half of U.S. farm workers are cur-
rently foreign born. For years, the agri-
culture industry has struggled to access suf-
ficient labor in sectors ranging from produce
to animal handling. This is only compounded
by the current low unemployment in the
United States. These factors are why the Na-
tional Association of State Departments of
Agriculture urges Congress to pass the
FWMA.
NASDA represents the Commissioners,
Secretaries, and Directors of the state de-
partments of agriculture in all fifty states
and four U.S. territories. NASDA members
represent all agriculture in their states and
finding practical solutions for the agri-
culture labor shortage is a top priority for
NASDA members.
Agriculture labor reform is crucial for en-
suring that U.S. farmers and ranchers have a
reliable and skilled workforce. This bill will,
for the first time, make year-round visas
available. This is crucial for the dairy indus-
try and other industries that rely on tem-
porary labor. Further, NASDA supports the
bill maintaining the H–2A program while
also creating a new, certified agricultural
worker status. This status and its renewable
visas will increase certainty for farmers,
ranchers and the farm workers who we rely
upon for the safe harvesting and handling of
crops and livestock.
NASDA acknowledges that a multi-faceted
effort is needed to fix the challenges with ag-
riculture labor, so any progress made on this
front is a step in the right direction. We look
forward to advancing solutions to agri-
culture’s labor shortage with Congress.
Sincerely,
DOUG GOEHRING,
NASDA President,
North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner.
COMMITTEE ON MIGRATION, COM-
MITTEE ON DOMESTIC JUSTICE AND
HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,
November 12, 2019, Washington, DC,
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Washington, DC.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the
Committee on Migration and the Committee
on Domestic Justice and Human Develop-
ment for the U.S. Conference of Catholic
Bishops, we write to urge you to support
H.R. 5038, the Farm Workforce Moderniza-
tion Act. This bipartisan legislation, intro-
duced on October 30, 2019, by Representative
Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) and several Republican
and Democratic sponsors, would create an
earned legal status program for agricultural
workers and would improve the existing H–
2A system.
Recognizing the dignity of work of farm-
workers and their families is a central con-
cern of the Catholic Church. In his 1981 en-
cyclical, Laborem Exercems, Pope John Paul
II spoke of the importance of agricultural
workers and the need to protect those work-
ing in the fields. Farmworkers produce the
food that we eat and contribute to the care
of our community. Regarding immigrant
farmworkers, the bishops in the U.S. have
long advocated for reforms of the existing
system, including a ‘‘legalization program
that would help stabilize the workforce, pro-
tect migrant workers, and their families
from discrimination and exploitation and en-
sure that these workers are able to continue
to make contributions to society.’’
H.R. 5038 proposes a meaningful way for
migrant agricultural workers to earn legal
status through continued agricultural em-
ployment and contributions to the U.S. agri-
cultural economy. It also improves labor
protections while producing employment
flexibility that is needed to aid our agricul-
tural industries. H.R. 5038 creates more ac-
cessible and predictable worker programs
while ensuring more worker protections,
such as improving the availability of farm-
worker housing and providing better health
protections.
As currently written, H.R. 5038 is a step in
the right direction and reflects genuine bi-
partisan engagement. We encourage you to

tions.

Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I urge
my colleagues to take the step and do
what we can to improve the labor situ-
ation for farmers and ranchers across
this country.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. COSTA), who has worked so
very hard on this bill and represents an
area where agriculture is king.
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, today is a
monumental and historical day. This
bipartisan Farm Workforce Moderniza-
tion Act of 2019 will truly help people
throughout the country.
I want to thank Chairperson ZOE
LOFGREN and DAN NEWHOUSE for their
hard work over the last 9 months in
bringing all the parties to the table.
Earlier this year, in September,
Chairperson LOFGREN, with Congress-
men PANETTA, COX, and myself, held a
workshop where all the organizations
from farm country, as well as the UFW,
and others, presented what needed to
be done. And, lo and behold, it has hap-
pened.
My colleagues ask, Why do we need
to have the urgency of this bill?
Well, last month I visited with
United Farmworkers in Madera, Cali-
fornia, and told them the promise of
this legislation. I saw in their eyes, and
their children who were there, I saw
hope; a hope to become free of fear and
the fear of deportation; hope for the
American Dream, and all that that en-
tails, that all immigrants past and
present have shared, in this legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
pass this bill today. The Senate must
pass it, and the President should sign
it into law. This is the right thing to
do.
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Florida
(Mr. YOHO).
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I would like
to commend my colleagues, Mr. BUCK
and Ms. LOFGREN, for attempting to do
something to solve a problem that has
gone on for a long time that has not
been solved. Unfortunately, this bill
will not solve that problem.
This bill will create the same situa-
tion we have had since 1986, because
this bill focuses on amnesty, not on a
guest worker program that our pro-
ducers need.
I appreciate their efforts, but, again,
I have worked around agriculture since
I was 15, picking vegetables, loading
vegetables, talking to farmers. And as
a veterinarian, working for 30 years in
that profession, I know the dairy situa-
tion.
I have talked to the migrant, and I
have talked producer. This bill will not
fulfill that need.
This bill will allow people to get am-
nesty. They will leave agriculture and
they will go into another industry.
Therefore, they are not going to solve
the labor shortage of this country.
That is why there are alternatives
out there. We have got a bill that we
worked on in a bipartisan manner, that
we have got strong support in industry,
and it solves this problem. It creates a
dedicated workforce for agriculture.
As you go through this bill, you see
amnesty after amnesty. And, again, it
does not solve the problem.
Our bill allows people to enter the
country legally. They are automati-
cally enrolled in the E-Verify system.
This bill promises to put the E-Verify
system in place once it is implemented.
We have heard that rhetoric out of
Washington before. Once it is imple-
mented, we will fix it.
This is the wrong way to go because
this bill, again, will not create a pre-
dictable, certain, and reliable work-
force for our agricultural producers.
And I hear over and over again, the
biggest challenge to our producers is a
labor shortage.
We are getting to a point in this
country where the next generation will
not farm because of the unpredict-
ability that this body has created, and
this bill will not solve that.
And we are getting to a point where
either we are going to import our
labor, or we are going to import our
produce. A nation that imports its
produce is not a secure nation. This
bill will not fix it. This will make it
worse.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, Rep-
resentative SYLVIA GARCIA, a member
of the Judiciary Committee, and a
former cotton picker, will submit a
statement in support of this bill.
And I would just note, for the prior
speaker, that the Florida Agri-Women,
the Florida Blueberry Growers Associa-
tion, the Florida Citrus Mutual, Flor-
ida Fruit & Vegetable Association,
Florida Nursery, Florida Strawberry,
and Florida Tomato Exchange think
this bill will work.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Texas (Mr. CASTRO).
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today in support of H.R. 5038, the
Farm Workforce Modernization Act of
2019.
I am very proud to support Congress-
woman LOFGREN, members of the His-
panic Caucus, and my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle who helped make
this bill possible today.
There are, in the United States, four
or five major industries that would not
exist the way they do but for immi-
grant labor, documented, and undocu-
mented. One of those industries is the
agriculture industry.
This bill would recognize the impor-
tant work that undocumented workers
do in our agriculture industry. It would
recognize that their work deserves re-
spect; that it is dignified; that it has a
place in our country; and that they
have a place in our country. It would
do so by allowing for a path to legal
status for these workers.
For 2 million folks, it would mean
that they would no longer face the
threat of deportation; that they and
their families could rest assured that
in the middle of the night they would
not be taken away from their children.
This legislation is important to our
country, and I hope that all of my col-
leagues, Republican and Democrat, will
support it today.
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. UPTON).
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, earlier this
year, the President, speaking at the
National Farm Bureau Convention,
called for legislation regarding agri-
culture immigration. And he acknowl-
edged that the ag community, in his
words, ‘‘needs people to help with the
farms.’’ That is what this bill does.
As much as most of us would like to
wave a magic wand and fix a very bro-
ken system, you know, what? We have
failed. But it is not for the lack of try-
ing. We simply haven’t had the votes;
whether it is more or less border secu-
rity; whether it is too comprehensive
or too less. We can’t even fix the
Dreamer issue. Come on.
This ag bill is going to pass, thank
goodness. And I want to thank JIMMY
PANETTA, DAN NEWHOUSE and other
members of the bipartisan Problem
Solvers Caucus, particularly Chair
LOFGREN, who helped deliver legisla-
tion here to the House floor this after-
noon.
Would I like to do more? You bet.
But, you know, at the moment, this is
the only step that we can do on a bi-
partisan basis this year. Let’s just face
it.
If we can’t pass a narrow bill, when is
it going to happen? This is the first
step, so let’s get it done.
This bill is going to provide a long
overdue and desperately needed over-
haul to the H–2A program, and it builds
on the July 2019 DOL’s proposal for H–
2A reforms.
Key provisions include a freeze on
the Adverse Effect Wage, which has led
directly to dozens of farm closures in
my district in Michigan; a streamlined
and modernized application process to
encourage more widespread adoption;
creating a year-round H–2A visa pro-
gram, allowing all of agriculture to
utilize the program.
Now is the time, finally, to at least
boldly act to pass a real ag labor re-
form to ensure that our ag community
has the workforce that it needs to re-
main the envy of the world. I would
urge all of my colleagues to support
this.

H10074 December 11, 2019
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, it is
really a great honor to yield 1 minute
to the gentlewoman from Washington
(Ms. SCHRIER), a freshman Member, but
a person who has worked very hard be-
hind the scenes to help advance this
bill.
b 1515
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding.
I thank my colleagues, Representa-
tive LOFGREN and Representative
NEWHOUSE, for their very hard work on
this bipartisan bill.
The critical needs of our farmers and
farmworkers have gone too long with-
out being addressed by Congress. As
the sole Member in the entire North-
west on the House Agriculture Com-
mittee, I am proud to represent the
apple capital of the world, Wenatchee,
as well as farmers and growers on both
sides of the Cascades, and I can say
that they are hurting.
What I hear from the farmers and or-
chardists across my State is that a sta-
ble workforce is critical to their abil-
ity to put food on our tables. As the do-
mestic workforce is dwindling, more
and more growers have been forced to
turn to the burdensome and bureau-
cratic H–2A program for the workers
they need to grow and harvest their
crops.
Farmworkers are critical. If the cher-
ries ripen and there is no one to pick
them, our farms and our farmers will
fail. Crops don’t wait, and millions of
dollars and futures are at stake.
This important bill will provide a
stable workforce for our farmers and a
path to legal status for farmworkers
and their families. This is the kind of
winning bipartisan legislation that is
exactly what our country needs. I en-
courage my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Idaho
(Mr. SIMPSON).
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
I rise today in favor of H.R. 5038, the
Farm Workforce Modernization Act,
and I thank Chairwoman LOFGREN, her
staff, the committee staff, and the per-
sonal staff of all the Members who have
been working on this bill for, I don’t
know, 8 or 9 months.
We all want the same thing, and we
are here today addressing agriculture’s
number one issue, and that is their
labor force.
We will hear a lot during this debate,
and we already have, about how this is
amnesty and indentured servitude. It is
neither of those things. In fact, those
are contradictory terms, so the argu-
ment at best is insincere.
Let me say what this bill does. It le-
galizes the current workforce so long
as workers get right with the law, have
a clean criminal record, and can dem-
onstrate the same work experiences
our former colleague Bob Goodlatte
said they must have to qualify. If they
want to access further legal status,
they work 4 to 8 more years in agri-
culture and then pay a fine and get in
line while they continue to work in ag-
riculture. That doesn’t sound like am-
nesty to me.
For my farmers back home who des-
perately need this, the bill streamlines
the H–2A program to make it more af-
fordable. It doesn’t do everything we
want, but it makes it better than what
we have today, in fact, much better
than what we have today.
It brings wages under control by
freezing them for 1 year and then cap-
ping future growth. There will be a sin-
gle online portal for farmers to access
workers. It will also set up a year-
round program for our dairymen, which
they don’t currently have.
Some people have said this is a great
bill for dairymen, but not the rest of
agriculture. That is not true. This
streamlines the H–2A program for all of
agriculture, so it is a good bill for all of
agriculture.
Finally, and again to my friends on
my side of the aisle, almost all of us
support E-Verify, and here it is. We
have E-Verify in this bill.
Agriculture is the backbone of Ida-
ho’s economy. Without this bill, how
can we pretend to say that we care
about rural America?
This bill has the support of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, Americans for
Prosperity, Cato Institute, and over 300
agricultural groups, which have al-
ready been entered into the RECORD.
This is the voice of rural America
saying they need this. I urge a ‘‘yes’’
vote on this bill, and I look forward to
working with all of my colleagues to
keep moving this bill forward so that it
can ultimately be signed into law and
solve a critical problem in America.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Oregon (Mr. SCHRADER), someone who
has done a great deal of work and
helped us get here today.
Mr. SCHRADER. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
I rise today in strong support of H.R.
5038, the Farm Workforce Moderniza-
tion Act. This compromise bill rep-
resents the kind of legislation this
body can put together and pass with
broad bipartisan support when Mem-
bers put aside ideological differences
and choose to work together to solve a
very serious and difficult issue.
With this legislation, we will finally
begin to address the labor crisis that
has been plaguing American agri-
culture by providing a stable and legal
workforce so they can continue to grow
the best food and fiber in the world.
In my home State of Oregon, we are
a specialty crop State. We rely on man-
ual labor for nearly every crop we
grow. The labor shortage is the number
one issue my farmers face. In many of
our ag industries, like nursery crops or
the dairy industry we just heard ref-
erenced, the labor is needed year-
round.
H.R. 5038 is a critical step forward in
not only providing workforce stability
for our farmers but also in providing a
path to lawful permanent residency for
hardworking farmworkers and their
family members.
I am also very proud of the work that
PCUN in Oregon has done to help make
this legislation a reality.
I hope our colleagues in the Senate
are paying close attention and move
this bill in short order. I urge all Mem-
bers to support this bill today.
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Florida
(Mr. DIAZ-BALART).
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker,
I thank the gentleman from Colorado
for yielding. I rise today to strongly
support this bipartisan bill.
You have heard today that, for dec-
ades, Congress has been talking about
the broken H–2A system, the system
that our farmers use to get the work-
force that they need to grow our food.
We have been talking about it for dec-
ades.
It is broken and not only creates an
economic issue for our farmers and for
the country, but it also creates a na-
tional security issue. Imagine if we
were forced to start having to import
our food.
Isn’t it time to kind of just stop talk-
ing and start working to bring forward
real bipartisan solutions? That is what
this bill does. Is it perfect? No, but
that is what this bill does. This bill
helps our farmers, finally brings help
to our farmers. It also regularizes our
farming workforce, which helps our
farmers, helps our communities, helps
our economy, and helps our national
security.
Again, this is crucial for those folks
who work hard every single day and
who are tired of hearing from Congress
just words of how broken the system is.
We finally have a bipartisan bill that
does what we have been talking about
for so many years. That is why I am
proud to support this bill.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Colorado (Mr. CROW), a freshman Mem-
ber who has worked behind the scenes
to help bring us here today.
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding.
I am proud to stand here with my
colleagues to support the Farm Work-
force Modernization Act on behalf of
farmers and farmworkers in Colorado.
Colorado farms are doing all they can
to move forward, despite the adminis-
tration’s trade war, which has led to a
15 percent reduction in Colorado agri-
cultural exports in 2019. It has also sti-
fled the migrant seasonal farmworker
program when farmers need it the
most.
Throughout this year, I have met
with farmers in my district, including
Robert Sakata of Sakata Farms in
Brighton, Colorado, which was started
in 1945 by his father. To Robert and
other Western growers, modernizing
the guest worker program is crucial to
their success as a family farm and
their contribution to our local econ-
omy.

December 11, 2019
This important piece of bipartisan
legislation will do just that. The bill
will establish a program for Colorado
farmworkers to earn legal status, im-
prove the H–2A program by ensuring
critical protections for workers, and
establish a mandatory nationwide E-
Verify system for all farmworkers.
I thank my colleague Representative
LOFGREN and all those who have
worked across the aisle to get this very
important bill done.
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. LAMALFA).
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Something needs to be underlined
here. In this area here of a divided Con-
gress, a divided country, this has been
a unique opportunity to have a true bi-
partisan solution to a longtime, dec-
ades-old problem. I am proud of the
work. Many of us have been able to get
in the room as Members and as staff
over many months and come to an
agreement that is a pretty darn good
solution for an ongoing problem.
This isn’t a border bill. This isn’t a
DACA bill. It is not a fence bill or an
amnesty bill. This is a narrow bill hav-
ing to do with having a stable work-
force for agriculture in this country.
I come from California, and many of
the crops are very labor intensive. I am
farmer myself, but I don’t benefit from
this bill. I don’t need that kind of
labor, but just so it is disclosed.
But so many crops that come from
California and others like the truck
crops, the intensely labor needful
crops, would disappear. We will end up
importing them from somewhere else if
we don’t have this workforce continue.
This bill makes for a legal workforce,
a documented workforce. Why wouldn’t
we want that?
But heaven knows, you say the word
‘‘amnesty,’’ people go running for the
hills, running for cover. This is not an
amnesty bill. How could it be when it
has benchmarks for the certified ag
workers to come in to be vetted before
they get that certification and to have
benchmarks to become a legal perma-
nent resident? Yes, at the very far end,
there is an opportunity for citizenship.
The way the process works, it would
probably take 18 to 20 years to accom-
plish.
For those who are really concerned
about it being a handout for citizenship
or whatever, it still is a steep hill.
Also, by and large, most American peo-
ple would look at these ag workers as
pretty good people. They are not per-
fect. There are issues here and there.
But they are providing a needed service
that I don’t see a lot of Americans will-
ing to do, not in this age of Xbox and
all these other things where nobody is
willing to go outside.
I have worked a lot of years myself in
the heat and the Sun, and it is not even
as tough as some of the other crops.
But for what we are talking about, we
really need to move forward.
This will help our dairies, which need
year-round labor. We are losing our
dairies in California. We are going to
lose dairies in our country.
Let’s talk about the workers them-
selves for a moment. How humane is it,
the process by which they have to
come across the border, pay these peo-
ple horrendous amounts of money, with
the issues that they are subject to in
coming across? No, we don’t want that.
We don’t want them coming across il-
legally. We want them coming across
with a certificate that they have been
vetted.
This bill has E-Verify in it. How big
of a thing is that for Republicans, for
conservatives, for people across the
country? When this is phased in, we
will have a very good process for
verifying who it is that is coming in to
do this work. We desperately need the
labor.
It has been a long process. It will be
a long process to continue to bring the
labor force in.
I think if we want to be here 10 years
from now still dealing with this, then
let’s vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. But if we
want to make a solution, this is one
that we can get right now in this at-
mosphere in D.C.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. PELOSI), the
Speaker of the House.
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
I commend Congresswoman LOFGREN
for her tremendous leadership on this
important legislation, the Farm Work-
force Modernization Act.
I join with Mr. LAMALFA, my friend,
my Italian America colleague from
California, in his strong remarks for
this bill.
It is bipartisan, and it is important
for us to pass it.
I proudly join all of my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to support this
bill, a historic victory for farmworkers
and for growers, which ensures that
America can continue to feed the
world.
I salute, again, Chair ZOE LOFGREN
for her months of tough, relentless
leadership without which this bill
would not be possible.
I commend the leadership of the
United Farm Workers. Arturo
Rodriguez has been working on this bill
for almost a generation, 17 years.
Arturo Rodriguez and Teresa Romero
have sent a statement of support for
the legislation, which very clearly
points out the need and the answer
that this bill is about.
I submit for the RECORD the United
Farm Workers statement of support for
the Farm Workforce Modernization
Act.
UNITED FARM WORKERS SUPPORT FOR THE
FARM WORKFORCE MODERNIZATION ACT
(H.R. 5038—LOFGREN)
The United Farm Workers of America sup-
ports the bipartisan Farm Workforce Mod-
ernization Act (H.R. 5038). We were proud to
join the bipartisan group of members of Con-
gress and the major grower associations to
develop and support H.R. 5038. It is cruelly
ironic that the people who feed the United
States live in a deep, all-encompassing fear
that they themselves cannot provide food for
their families. The human cost and stress for
farm workers and their families as they live
in fear of deportation and harassment due to
our broken immigration system threatens
our nation’s food supply and is a source of
great shame for our nation. The compromise
legislation authored by Representatives
Lofgren, cosponsored by a bipartisan, diverse
group of over 50 members of the House, and
endorsed by the Congressional Hispanic Cau-
cus will go a long way towards improving the
lives of farm workers today and in the fu-
ture, and our broken immigration system.
We support H.R. 5038 for a simple reason—
it will make the lives of all farm workers
better. H.R. 5038 meets the following basic
principles:
1. Equality of Treatment—the new agricul-
tural visa program will allow farm workers
and their families to have the same rights
and protections as current U.S. farm work-
ers.
2. No Discrimination—the program does
not create major incentives to discriminate
against U.S. workers (including newly legal-
ized workers).
3. Fairness in pay—the pay rates protect
U.S. workers and supports predictable pay
increases.
4. Eligibility to earn permanent resi-
dence—no one that works to feed our coun-
try should be condemned to permanent sec-
ond class status. H.R. 5038 changes our cur-
rent immoral system.
You have the ability to pass H.R. 5038. If
H.R. 5038 becomes law, agricultural workers
will have stability for themselves, and their
families and the agricultural industry.
Please vote YES on H.R. 5038.
TERESA ROMERO,
President, United
Farm Workers.
ARTURO S. RODRIGUEZ,
President Emeritus
and former Board
Chair, United Farm
Workers and UFW
Foundation.
Ms. PELOSI. So many Members
brought their vision, their voices, their
values to this process. I thank all of
you for strengthening the bill we have
on the floor today. I thank our friends
from the groups for doing the outside
organizing that makes our inside ma-
neuvering successful. We have all been
inspired by the immortal words of our
beloved Dolores Huerta: ‘‘Si, se puede.’’
This legislation honors workers’ dig-
nity and supports the farm economy
with strong, smart reforms. The bill
provides a path for legalization, as Mr.
LAMALFA referenced, for currently un-
documented farmworkers. No one who
works to feed our country should be
condemned to permanent second-class
status.
The bill secures the agricultural
workforce of the future by updating,
expanding, and strengthening the H–2A
initiative to ensure that farms have
stable, secure workforces.
Critically, it demands fair, humane
treatment for farmworkers, following
the lead of legislation in California by
securing fairness in pay, improving ac-
cess to quality housing, and ensuring
robust safety and heat illness protec-
tions.

helped lead the fight for farmworkers
for decades.
This fight is not only about ensuring
fair wages and fair treatment, but
about honoring the spark of divinity
within each person, which makes us all
worthy of dignity and respect.
This bill honors the 2 million farm-
workers who are the backbone of our
economy and country, powering our
farm economy, and producing the food
on our tables, even as they persevere
through harsh working conditions and
low wages.
As the United States Conference of
Catholic Bishops wrote last month in
support of this bill: ‘‘The dignity of
work of farmworkers and their families
is a central concern. . . . Farmworkers
produce the food that we eat and con-
tribute to the care of our community.’’
This legislation is a critical step for-
ward for workers, for growers, and for
the farm economy, but our work is not
done. Led by Chair ZOE LOFGREN and
Members from every corner of the
country, we will continue to work to
stabilize the farm economy, protect
workers and their families, and main-
tain America’s proud agricultural pre-
eminence in the world.
As we do so, remember the words of
the late Cesar Chavez. He said this:
‘‘To make a great dream come true,
the first requirement is a great capac-
ity to dream; the second is persist-
ence.’’
Madam Speaker, I thank Chair
LOFGREN for her persistence, and I
thank Mr. Rodriguez for his help.
I am pleased with the bipartisanship
of this bill. I thank our Members for
their persistence on this legislation,
for which I urge a strong bipartisan
vote.
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. BUCK
for his leadership on this as well.
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. BIGGS), my friend, who was a
leader in Arizona in the legislature on
these issues and others and is known
throughout our caucus for his common
sense and leadership, and I anxiously
await his remarks.
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding time to me.
Many of us have heard from farmers
and agricultural suppliers around the
country about their need for labor to
ensure their products can be harvested,
processed, and sold. I have heard time
and time again from business owners
who prioritize hiring American work-
ers but repeatedly find themselves
without the labor necessary.
This problem is worthy of a broader
conversation in Congress, including
how we address the root of the problem
and any relation to the welfare state
that we have created here.
My main concerns today, however, go
beyond addressing true labor shortages
and, instead, focus on the rewards this
legislation provides to employers who
have chosen to use illegal labor and to
aliens who have chosen to work ille-
gally in the United States.
This bill creates a new pathway to
legal status for illegal aliens who have
been working in the agricultural indus-
try in the United States. Any alien who
merely applies for legal status under
the program, whether truly eligible,
immediately receives work authoriza-
tion, protection from removal, and the
ability to travel outside the United
States. Those who meet the require-
ments will be rewarded with a pathway
to lawful, permanent resident status
and, ultimately, citizenship.
Foreign nationals around the world
wait years and spend thousands of dol-
lars to receive those same benefits.
This legislation is an unacceptable slap
in the face to all those who follow our
immigration laws.
Worse still, this legislation does lit-
tle to root out fraud, instead, blatantly
incentivizing it.
The ability to receive work author-
ization and other benefits upon appli-
cation will likely lead many individ-
uals to submit applications even if
they are not eligible, but they will
have no fear of doing so because there
are no penalties attached. Aliens can
withdraw their fraudulent application
without prejudice to any further appli-
cation.
This legislation also condones and
turns a blind eye to instances of immi-
gration fraud by waiving inadmis-
sibility for aliens who previously tried
to fraudulently gain legal status or
falsely claimed to be U.S. citizens.
There are several other concerning
provisions with this legislation:
It creates a new grant program to as-
sist eligible applicants—illegal aliens—
in applying for this newly created im-
migration status.
It prohibits use of E-Verify to check
a new hire’s employment eligibility
until that person is actually hired and
requires use of the program in a way
that demonstrates a fundamental mis-
understanding of the mechanics of the
E-Verify system.
It allows aliens to prove work history
with only a sworn affidavit from some-
one who ostensibly has direct knowl-
edge of their work history.
It fails to impose any real penalty for
months and years of illegal work, and
it fails to impose any real penalty on
employers who knowingly violated U.S.
law for their own benefit.
At a time when our immigration sys-
tem is rampant with illegality, when
we have little control over our south-
ern border and there are crisis levels of
individuals trying to illegally immi-
grate, we should not be promoting leg-
islation that rewards years of illegal
behavior.
Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I
oppose this legislation and urge my
colleagues to do the same.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), someone who
has been through a lot. She is a senior
Member of the House and the most sen-
ior woman in the House, has served the
most time.
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I
thank so very much Madam Chair for
yielding to me and for her distin-
guished leadership on behalf of the
American producers and farmworkers
who are the subject of this important
bill. I have a sense of how long she has
worked on this.
For too long, I have borne painful
witness to the plight of our continent’s
migrant farmworkers, as well as the
problems our growers are having.
These hardworking migrant workers
endure harsh working conditions at
jobs that the American people simply
are not interested in and won’t do.
These workers endure very harsh con-
ditions to make sure that food gets to
our tables, from farm to table. We
could not feed this country without
these workers.
Many of these workers leave their
families and journey to the United
States in hopes of finding decent work
at a respectable wage, yet far too often
are subjugated to exploitative serfdom.
That is why I stand heartened that the
Farm Workforce Modernization Act
has been brought forth to this House
floor.
This bill has strengths, as others
have talked about: It regularizes the
workforce; it addresses very serious
issues.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
DEGETTE). The time of the gentle-
woman has expired.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield the gentlewoman from Ohio an
additional 15 seconds.
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, this
bill regularizes the workforce, address-
es the very serious issues of heat ill-
ness prevention and decent lodging,
and also has other necessary provisions
that demand our support.
We must address the conditions of
these workers. They cannot be preyed
upon. I look forward to continuing to
work with my colleagues to improve
conditions not addressed in this bill.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the
chairwoman for her fantastic work,
speaking up for some of America’s
most forgotten workers.
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I have
no further witnesses and am prepared
to close.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, may
I inquire how much time remains on
each side.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California has 151⁄4 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from
Colorado has 41⁄2 minutes remaining.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I would like to first
make a comment in lieu of the testi-
mony that was going to be given by
Representative CLAY from Missouri.
Unfortunately—or fortunately; I don’t
know what they are voting on—the Fi-
nancial Services Committee is meet-
ing, and he has been detained there
voting in that committee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10077
December 11, 2019
Mr. CLAY was here to talk about an
important thing that the Financial
Services Committee helped us with in
the drafting of this bill, and that is the
improvement in the availability of
farmworker housing while lowering
employer costs as it relates to housing,
and that is a win. We need to make
sure that H–2A workers who come to
the United States have a decent place
to live while they are here working.
Now, preserving the existing housing
stock, including by adopting H.R. 3620,
the Strategy and Investment in Rural
Housing Preservation Act, which au-
thorizes $1 billion to rehabilitate hous-
ing that is aging out of the USDA in-
centives program, is included in this
bill.
Incentivizing new housing by tripling
funding for USDA section 514 and 516
rural housing loan and grant programs
and doubling funding for section 512
rental assistance programs, increasing
the USDA per project loan limitation,
and granting operating subsidies to 514,
516 property owners who house H–2A
workers is going to be a real important
boost to rural America. Not only will it
increase the amount of housing and the
quality of housing, but it will also in-
ject new economic activity in rural
America. And we all know that, eco-
nomically, rural America is suffering
in terms of jobs more than other parts
of the country.
So this is a win-win-win. It is a win
for farmers by lowering their costs; it
is a win for H–2A migrant workers so
they can have a decent place to live;
and it is a win for people who live in
rural America who are going to be
building these facilities, who will see
an injection of funds to improve their
economy.
So Mr. CLAY could not be here to talk
about his bill, but I am talking about
it on his behalf.
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to
the gentleman from California (Mr. PA-
NETTA), the Representative for Salinas
Valley, someone who has worked on
this bill for a huge amount of time—
not only he, but his staff.
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I
thank Chairwoman LOFGREN for her
amazing leadership on this bill. It is an
honor to have her as a colleague. It is
an honor to have her as my direct
neighbor to the north in California.
Madam Speaker, let me also take
this time to thank Representative DAN
NEWHOUSE for his courage, his willing-
ness to be bold on this bill was phe-
nomenal.
Let me thank both of their staffs for
the amazing amount of work that they
did on this bill.
Madam Speaker, let me thank all of
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle
who have worked on this bill, espe-
cially FRED UPTON and the Problem
Solvers Caucus, who are supporting
this bill.
This bill, the Farm Workforce Mod-
ernization Act, is a step in the right di-
rection for our agriculture, for immi-
gration reform, and, yes, even this Con-
gress.
This bill would protect our existing
ag workers, and it promotes an endur-
ing ag workforce. This bill does that by
allowing those who have worked in ag
to stay working in ag and the oppor-
tunity to earn a pathway here in this
country.
It does that by modernizing an out-
dated system for temporary workers
and adding 3-year visas for year-round
workers. It does that by ensuring a
number of visas, fair wages, a supply of
housing, and safe working conditions.
By passing this bill, finally, farmers
will have access to a dependable and
experienced workforce, and farm-
workers will not get just the legality,
but the dignity that they deserve.
I am not only proud of the product in
this bill, but all of us here in the House
of Representatives should be extremely
proud of the process behind the formu-
lation of this bill.
For the past 9 months out of this
year, farmers and farmworkers, Demo-
crats and Republicans, came to the
table, sat at the table, and stayed at
the table to grind out the details in
this bill.
Now, yes, it is not a perfect bill, but
it really is a darn good bill, a bill
which is the result of a compromise.
That is why this bill is a huge step in
the right direction for farmers, for
farmworkers, for our agricultural com-
munities, for our country, for Demo-
crats and Republicans in this Congress,
and for who we are as a democracy,
built on a nation of immigrants.
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I include in the
RECORD Ranking Member COLLINS’
statement.
Once again, I appreciate my col-
leagues’ desire to fix this problem and
provide our farmers and ranchers with
a long-term solution to the labor sup-
ply problems in this country; however,
this bill only masks the existing prob-
lems and creates a whole host of new
issues that we will have to revisit in a
few years, and it polarizes Americans
further.
My colleagues and I can agree that
we need to fix this problem. Poten-
tially allowing criminals a pathway to
citizenship isn’t the way. Allowing pos-
sible Social Security fraud isn’t the
way. Preventing our employers from
curing problems and giving trial attor-
neys a handout isn’t the way.
Madam Speaker, I truly want to help
all of our farmers and ranchers, but
this bill is wrong, and I cannot support
it. I urge my colleagues to vote against
the bill.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, this is the time to
act. For many years, under the leader-
ship of different Speakers with dif-
ferent majorities, we have talked about
dealing with this issue, and that is all
we did: we talked.
You know, there is never a perfect
piece of legislation, but as Mr. PA-
NETTA said, this is a darn good piece of
legislation.
b 1545
It was the one that was crafted to-
gether, and a lot of people across
America might be surprised that Re-
publicans and Democrats sat down in a
room, along with stakeholders who
often don’t agree with each other, and
we worked things out. We came up
with a plan that will work.
We know it will work because we
have a list of close to 300 agricultural
entities, farmers all across the United
States, who are asking us to please
pass this bill. They know it will work.
Madam Speaker, I include in the
RECORD that list.
NOVEMBER 18, 2019.
Hon. NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY,
Minority Leader, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: The undersigned groups, rep-
resenting a broad cross-section of agri-
culture and its allies, urge you to advance
the Farm Workforce Modernization Act
(H.R. 5038) through the House to address the
labor crisis facing American agriculture. A
stable, legal workforce is needed to ensure
farmers and ranchers have the ability to con-
tinue producing an abundant, safe, and af-
fordable food supply.
The effects of agriculture’s critical short-
age of labor reach far beyond the farm gate,
negatively impacting our economic competi-
tiveness, local economies, and jobs. Econo-
mists have found that every farm worker en-
gaged in high-value, labor-intensive crop and
livestock production sustains two to three
off-farm jobs. As foreign producers take ad-
vantage of our labor shortage and gain mar-
ket share, America will export not only our
food production but also thousands of these
farm-dependent jobs. Securing a reliable and
skilled workforce is essential, not only for
the agricultural industry but for the U.S.
economy as a whole.
The House must pass legislation that pre-
serves agriculture’s experienced workforce
by allowing current farm workers to earn
legal status. For future needs, legislation
must include an agricultural worker visa
program that provides access to a legal and
reliable workforce moving forward. This visa
program needs to be more accessible, pre-
dictable, and flexible to meet the needs of
producers, including those with year-round
labor needs, such as dairy and livestock
which currently do not have meaningful ac-
cess to any program.
While the bill does include a few provisions
that raise significant concerns for the agri-
cultural community, we are committed to
working together throughout the legislative
process to fully address these issues. It is
vital to move the Farm Workforce Mod-
ernization Act (H.R. 5038) through the House
as a significant step in working to meet the
labor needs of agriculture, both now and in
the future.

DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS: We write to
urge you to support the Farm Workforce
Modernization Act of 2019, HR 5038. The bill
is a bipartisan compromise representing the
culmination of hard fought negotiations to
address the needs of farmworkers and our ag-
riculture system in the context of our bro-
ken immigration system. Importantly, this
bill recognizes the valuable role of farm-
workers in our food system by providing an
earned path to legal immigration status and
citizenship to farmworkers and their fami-
lies.
If enacted, the Farm Workforce Moderniza-
tion Act would provide an opportunity for
experienced agricultural workers to apply

for legal status if they show employment in
U.S. agriculture and meet other criteria. At
least half of the nation’s roughly 2.4 million
farmworkers are undocumented immigrants
and immigration relief is urgently needed to
address the constant fear of deportation
many farmworkers and their children experi-
ence. The ability to obtain immigration sta-
tus and a path to citizenship is key to ena-
bling farmworkers to bargain for better
working and living conditions and to chal-
lenge serious labor abuses. This legislation
would result in a more stable farm labor
force and greater food safety and security to
the benefit of employers, workers, and con-
sumers.
The bill also would revise the existing H–
2A visa program to address concerns of both
farmworkers and agricultural employers.
The compromise includes concessions made
by all sides in this debate and includes both
important new protections for farmworkers,
such as new protections against trafficking,
as well as provisions sought by employers.
Importantly, for the first time, the bill
would recognize the humanity of those work-
ing here under temporary visas by providing
a path to permanent status for those who
satisfy the specified work requirements.
The Farm Workforce Modernization Act of
2019 is an important step forward and sends
a clear signal that there are leaders in Con-
gress ready to engage constructively on im-
migration and reach across the aisle to de-
velop sensible policies. We encourage you to
support this legislation and join this impor-
tant effort to protect farmworkers and our
nation’s agricultural system.

Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker,
there is a letter here from Farmworker
Justice that I include in the RECORD
explaining why this is an important
thing to do.
FARMWORKER JUSTICE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, HOUSE OF REPRESENTA-
TIVES, FARMWORKER JUSTICE STATEMENT ON
HOUSE AGRICULTURAL IMMIGRATION REFORM
BILL
Farmworker Justice supports the Farm
Workforce Modernization Act of 2019, H.R.
5038, which is under consideration by the Ju-
diciary Committee of the House of Rep-
resentatives. The FWMA should be approved
by the Judiciary Committee and passed by
the full House.
The bipartisan bill resulted from lengthy,
complex negotiations led by Rep. Lofgren
(D–CA), Chair of the Subcommittee on Immi-
gration and Citizenship, and Rep. Newhouse
(R–WA), a farmer and former Director of
Washington State’s Department of Agri-
culture, and additional colleagues. To help
reach agreement, Members of Congress in-
volved farmworker advocates, including the
United Farm Workers, UFW Foundation, and
Farmworker Justice, and agricultural em-
ployer trade associations. Farmworker Jus-
tice appreciates the scheduling of the mark-
up of the FWMA by the Chair of the Judici-
ary Committee, Rep. Nadler.
Of utmost importance, the supporters of
this legislation recognize the important con-
tributions of farmworkers to our nation’s
food and agriculture systems. An estimated
2.4 million people labor on our farms and
ranches to provide us with fruits, vegetables,
milk and other food. This legislation ad-
dresses the fundamentally unfair conditions
experienced by many farmworkers due to our
nation’s broken immigration system. The
large majority of the nation’s farmworkers
are immigrants, and a majority lack author-
ized immigration status. Undocumented
farmworkers and their family members live
in fear of arrest, deportation and the break-
up of their families. In these circumstances,
many farmworkers are reluctant to chal-
lenge illegal or unfair treatment in their
workplaces and their communities. At times,
they cannot go to work due to the presence
of immigration enforcement agents. The
country’s farms and our food system depend
on immigrants, both documented and un-
documented.
The Farm Workforce Modernization Act
bill provides a path to lawful permanent resi-
dency for undocumented farmworkers and
their family members. It would eliminate
the constant fear of deportation and family
breakup that is so stressful for many farm-
worker families. Removing the threat of im-
migration enforcement also would reduce
disruptions of farming businesses. With legal
status and a path to citizenship, farm-
workers would be better able to improve
their wages and working conditions and seek
enforcement of their labor protections.
These improvements would result in a more
stable farm labor force and greater food safe-
ty and security to the benefit of employers,
workers, and consumers. The earned legal-
ization program’s requirements are more rig-
orous and expensive than we would have pre-
ferred, but are acceptable in the effort to
reach a realistic compromise.
The bill also would revise the existing H–
2A agricultural guestworker program to ad-
dress farmworker and employer concerns
with the program. Farmworker advocates
have pressed for reforms to reduce wide-
spread abuses under this flawed program,
while agricultural employers have lobbied
heavily to remove most of its modest labor
protections, claiming that the program is
unduly expensive and bureaucratic. The
bill’s lengthy provisions include important
new protections for farmworkers, as well as
changes to address agricultural employers’
concerns. Compromise was necessary to
achieve legislation that could become law
and address serious harms imposed on farm-
worker families by our broken immigration
system.
Farmworker Justice supports the Farm
Workforce Modernization Act of 2019 because
the bill, if passed, would enable hundreds of
thousands of farmworker families to improve
significantly their living and working condi-
tions and their participation in our economy
and democracy.
Farmworker Justice, based in Washington,
D.C., is a national advocacy organization for
farmworkers with over thirty-five years of
experience serving the farmworker commu-
nity regarding immigration and labor policy.
FJ’s website contains extensive information
about farmworkers, immigration policy,
labor conditions and the H–2A agricultural
guestworker program.

Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker,
there have been some who have sug-
gested privately, or even in public—the
ranking member of the full committee
in the Rules Committee last night said,
Well, we should be covering chicken
processing plants.
We did just one thing in this bill, and
that was to deal with agriculture. We
didn’t expand the definition of agri-
culture. There may be issues in other
parts of the American economy, but we
decided to focus on just this one thing:
agriculture—not processing, not truck-
ing, not forestry, just agriculture.
The Laborers International Union
has sent a letter in support, which I in-
clude in the RECORD, endorsing this bill
and noting that this bill works in the
agricultural sector and they hope that
we will vote for it.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Washington, DC.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the
more than 500,000 members of the Laborers’

(LIUNA), I want to express our support for

Modernization Act.

path to legal immigration status and citizen-
ship. H.R. 5038 does just that, providing secu-
rity for millions of farm workers and their
families. This in turn will lead to better
wages and working conditions for a group of
workers who have historically been subject
to horrific abuses.
H.R. 5038 also specifies that employers who
try to misuse the H–2A program in industries
covered by a different guest worker visa pro-
gram (H–2B), including construction and
landscape, cannot do so. Specifically, LIUNA
is pleased that the House included language
to the H–2.A program requirements to inves-
tigate and prevent fraud in the H–2A pro-
gram, as well as to ensure that employers
cannot use H–2A workers if the majority of
the worker’s duties are related to Construc-
tion.
While LIUNA is supporting H.R. 5038, we
want to be clear that while many of these re-
forms may make sense in the agricultural in-
dustry, it does not mean that all of the bill’s
provisions are necessary or helpful for other
guest worker visa programs or workers in
other industries. Historically, agricultural
workers have been treated under different
rules and laws than those in other industries,
both permanent and guest workers. All of
the reforms in H.R. 5038 for the H-2A pro-
gram may not work for the H–2B program,
for example. The H–2B guest worker program
is commonly abused by employers in the
landscape and construction industries to
deny workers already in the U.S. access to
jobs and to exploit workers both in and out
of the U.S. The H–2B program must be sig-
nificantly reformed in ways that will address
the specific abuses of our union’s construc-
tion and landscape members and foreign
workers alike. LIUNA looks forward to
working with Congress on H–2B reform in
the near future.
For decades, LIUNA has fought for com-
prehensive immigration reform, which re-
mains our goal. While we work toward that
end, LIUNA supports efforts including H.R.
5038 to give vulnerable workers and their
families who have suffered historic exploi-
tation a path to security and citizenship.
LIUNA asks that you vote for H.R. 5038, the
Farm Workforce Modernization Act.
With kind regards, I am
Sincerely yours,
TERRY O’SULLIVAN,
General President.
Ms. LOFGREN. There may be other
issues when you come to other parts of
the economy. We should address those
issues as well, but we are going to have
to do that by sitting down, just as we
did in this case, with the unions, with
the employers, with the stakeholders
to see what the issues are and how can
we craft a bipartisan solution that
makes America strong, that makes our
economy work.
I am confident we will have a chance
to do that.
Now, I just want to say, some of the
comments made, although I am sure
made in good faith, about the bill are
incorrect.
The elements, the suggestion that
this will be riddled with fraud is just
simply incorrect. These antifraud
measures are the same that were in-
cluded and, in fact, in some cases are
tougher than were included in the
Goodlatte bill that Members supported
in the last Congress.
The criminal national security bars
are stronger than were included in the
Goodlatte bill in the last Congress.
And I have heard also that these
farmworkers, who have worked in the
fields, who have allowed us to eat vege-
tables and to have a salad, that they
should get in line.
I will tell you a sad thing: There is
no line for them. There is no line. So
we are creating a line with this bill. We
are allowing them to get right with the
law and live lawfully, pay taxes, and do
the jobs that we need them to do, that
their employers need them to do, with
dignity and without fear.
I cannot forget going out and talking
to farmworkers who are so afraid be-
cause of enforcement. They are afraid
to leave their homes to go to church on
Sunday morning. That is not the kind
of situation we want to have in Amer-
ica.
We write the laws. We can make sure
that these individuals comply with the
law. We have E-Verify in this bill. We
have a system that will work for farm-
ers, for farmworkers, and for America.
We have done it over a period of
months. We have done it bipartisan. We
have the support of American agri-
culture, and I hope we have the support
of a broad, bipartisan group when this
bill comes to a vote today.
Let’s not disappoint the people who
are counting on us. Let’s stand up and
get something done, finally, on this
measure that we have failed on over
and over again.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker,
farmworkers toil under difficult and dangerous
conditions for long hours and low pay to en-
sure America has a safe and plentiful food
supply.
Because of the scarcity of domestic farm
labor, for decades, the agricultural sector has
depended largely on the labor of migrant
workers. The vast majority of crop workers in
the United States were not born here and are
undocumented or here on guest visas. Though
these workers perform incredibly difficult work
under hazardous conditions, they are often un-
able to seek recourse when their rights are
violated. A pathway to citizenship, when ac-
companied by appropriate oversight meas-
ures, could help reduce these dedicated work-
ers’ justifiable fear of reprisal for asserting
their rights. Farmworkers are integral to our
communities and our economy. Creating a
pathway to citizenship for these individuals—
who work to feed us and our country year
after year—as well as their families is both an
economic and humanitarian necessity.
I support legalization of vulnerable, undocu-
mented workers and a path to citizenship.
However, in exchange for legalization for
some undocumented farmworkers, this bill
would depress labor standards for H–2A work-
ers. Because weakened labor standards for
H–2A workers could adversely impact the do-
mestic workforce, this bill could negatively im-
pact the economic security of all farmworkers.
Wage cuts for many H–2A workers in turn
would depress wages for all farmworkers, The
adverse effect wage rate (AEWR), which is
often the binding wage paid to H–2A workers,
is designed to ensure that wages paid to H–
2A workers do not depress wages for U.S.
farmworkers. This means the AEWR must be
high enough to reflect wages paid in the local
labor market. This bill would change the way
the AEWR is currently calculated over the first
ten years to reflect average wages paid to
farmworkers in the region according to their
specific occupation, rather than the average
wage paid to farmworkers across all occupa-
tions. However, the bill fails to require the use
of data that actually reflects local wage condi-
tions. Additionally, while setting limitations on
how much AEWR wages can decrease after
an initial one-year freeze, the bill imposes
caps on wage increases from year to year,
limiting whether AEWR can truly reflect wages
paid in the local labor market.
As a result of these changes to the AEWR,
the majority of H–2A workers would see their
wages actually go down, albeit modestly, while
others would see the growth in their wages
capped. I have opposed similar efforts pro-
posed by the Trump Administration that would
depress wages.
This year, I was pleased to lead the House
passage of H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act,
which would boost wages for millions of lower-
wage workers. I am confident that in the next
ten years, we will enact a meaningful increase
in the federal minimum wage, boosting wages
for workers across our nation including farm-
workers. However, I am concerned that H.R.
5038 will create artificial barriers to wage
growth, or worse, lead to wage cuts, con-
tinuing to leave farmworkers relegated to low
pay and economic insecurity.
Our country’s wage and hour laws are de-
signed to ensure that workers are guaranteed
a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work. But this
right is only as strong as a worker’s ability to
hold employers accountable, especially in
court. Unfortunately, this bill creates obstacles
that may delay farmworkers’ ability to access
their day in court, when they have been vic-
tims of wage theft. While I welcome extending
coverage of the the Migrant and Seasonal Ag-
ricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA) to H–
2A workers, adding a mediation requirement
to both the MSPA and the Fair Labor Stand-
ards Act (FLSA) is problematic. This bill en-
ables employers to impose three months of
mandatory mediation when an H–2A worker
brings a civil suit under these laws, even if the
worker does not consent to the mediation and
wants his or her day in court. This undermines
the voluntary nature of mediation and provides
bad actors with an avenue for delaying or de-
nying wage recovery. This delay could prove
significant for farmworkers who may be in this
country for a limited amount of time to partici-
pate in litigation. This is especially fraught
given that, in contrast to MSPA, the FLSA pro-
vides for recovery of unpaid wages and
liquated, or double, damages and recovery of
attorney’s fees, plus costs. This provision may
also pull domestic farmworkers or other visa
classifications of workers into required medi-
ation where there are collective or class ac-
tions, thereby undermining incentives for other
workers to join with H–2A workers to seek re-
dress.
This September, I supported the passage of
H.R. 1423, the FAIR Act, to ban forced arbitra-
tion in many areas, including employment, be-
cause it could delay or totally block workers’
access to courts. We should promote legisla-
tion that protects workers’ fundamental right to
have their day in court, not delay it.
This bill denies newly legalized farmworkers
and their families access to key social safety

net programs, such as Medicaid and subsidies
under the Affordable Care Act. Denial of bene-
fits that can promote economic stability, cou-
pled with the bill’s wage suppressing provi-
sions, threatens to create a long-term pool of
economically vulnerable workers. While most
of these individuals do not currently have ac-
cess to these benefits due to their immigration
status, leaving immigrant workers who are
granted legal status under this legislation with-
out access to social safety net programs es-
tablishes a dangerous precedent that access
to health care and other basic necessities can
be traded away for a path to legal status.
This legislation weakens the current recruit-
ment and hiring standards for U.S. farm-
workers. A reduction in employers’ obligations
to hire U.S. workers under this bill will under-
mine one of the core principles of the H–2A
program: that H–2A workers should fill in gaps
in the farm workforce that U.S. employers are
truly unable to fill, rather than merely replacing
U.S. workers that employers could attract with
reasonable efforts. I raised concerns with simi-
lar efforts to modify recruitment standards by
the Trump Administration earlier this year.
Agricultural work is hazardous, and workers
in this sector have few legal health and safety
protections. Ensuring that H–2A workers and
all farmworkers have safe, healthy working
conditions is critical. I am pleased that this bill
requires H–2A employers to maintain heat ill-
ness prevention plans and requires H–2A em-
ployers in the dairy industry to maintain work-
place safety plans. However, as presently writ-
ten, some provisions are ambiguous and
would be difficult to enforce; other provisions
have weak minimum requirements that would
limit their value. As this legislation moves for-
ward, I would urge the inclusions of stronger
health and safety standards.
Strong labor protections are vital to protect
both H–2A workers, who are vulnerable given
their temporary status, and domestic farm-
workers, whose employers may be
disincentivized to provide employment. This is
especially true given that farmworkers have
historically been carved out of labor and em-
ployment laws, leaving these workers with
fewer wage protections and rights to bargain
for better working conditions.
While this bill does make some improve-
ments in immigration law, I look forward to
supporting a version of this bill that more ac-
curately reflects strong labor standards.
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today in support of H.R. 5038, the Farm
Workforce Modernization Act. This bipartisan
piece of legislation will go a long way in ad-
dressing the shortage of labor in our agri-
culture sector. This bill will also provide a
pathway to citizenship for agricultural workers
who have spent many years working in the
fields helping to ensure we have a safe and
affordable food supply.
Thanks to the leadership of Chairwoman
LOFGREN and Congressman NEWHOUSE, we
have finally started to look at immigration as a
solution to some of our labor shortages. Farm-
ers and ranchers rely on foreign seasonal ag-
ricultural workers largely because it’s difficult
to find a reliable source of labor domestically
for this sector. It’s a fair compromise that
these workers be offered a pathway to citizen-
ship so that they can one day live the Amer-
ican dream just like the rest of us.
It is my hope that this bill can serve as a
blueprint for other sectors of our economy
where labor shortages persist. Construction is
a prime example of this. My district, along with
the rest of North Texas is in the process of
seeing rapid population growth. This means
construction workers are in high demand to
build new homes, schools, roads, and hos-
pitals for the thousands of people moving to
the region every month. Similar reforms in the
construction industry would help in making
sure the economy in North Texas can con-
tinue to prosper.
Madam Speaker, we have a unique oppor-
tunity here today to pass legislation that would
benefit both farmers and the agricultural work-
ers they employ. I urge my colleagues to vote
in support of this bill.
Ms. SÁNCHEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in support of H.R. 5038, the Farm Work-
force Modernization Act of 2019. I would like
to thank Congresswoman LOFGREN and Con-
gressman NEWHOUSE for convening agriculture
and labor stakeholders to develop this historic
piece of legislation.
This bill represents true bipartisan efforts to
help stabilize our nation’s agriculture crisis.
New workplace and legal protections for farm-
workers, including gender-based protections
and heat safety standards, are established
under this bill.
Farmworkers have fought long and hard for
these reforms. By voting to strengthen health
and safety standards and provide legal status
to agricultural workers, we do right by the
hardworking men and women who put food on
our table.
This bill also modernizes the agricultural
guest worker program in order to address the
nation’s agricultural labor shortage. After
months of negotiations, I believe we have de-
veloped a commonsense solution that will help
both farmworkers and farmers.
I am proud to have worked with my col-
leagues to make this bill a reality.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
Georgia is home to a vast agriculture industry
with hardworking farmers, ranchers, growers
and processors who contribute to America’s
economy every day. In the northeast corner
where my district is located, more than 10,000
farm operators grow everything from peaches
to cattle, chickens to strawberries.
There is no doubt that not enough American
workers want to work in agriculture to fulfill the
needs of the industry. Most farmers are offer-
ing competitive wages to attract workers, while
at the same time being conscious of the reality
that, when production costs get too high and
they can no longer sell their crops at a com-
petitive rate, they could be out of business.
Growers are increasingly turning to the H–
2A visa program to get the temporary labor
they need, but the program needs reform. The
agricultural industry wants and deserves a
streamlined program that provides more cer-
tainty as to the temporary labor needed to
sustain their businesses.
H–2A users have asked Congress for many
reforms of the H–2A program. Unfortunately,
despite its proponents’ claims, H.R. 5038
doesn’t fix many of the issues with the pro-
gram, and, in some cases, the bill makes the
problems worse.
Growers have requested permanent, long-
term wage rate relief instead of the unpredict-
able adverse effect wage rate that H–2A users
are currently required to pay. This change
would help farmers plan for the next growing
season without facing increases of 6.2 percent
like they did for fiscal year 2019. H.R. 5038
fails to provide long-term stability in wage de-
terminations.
H–2A users have asked for litigation reform
that protects against frivolous lawsuits but pro-
vides an efficient way to resolve workers’ le-
gitimate issues. H.R. 5038 does exactly the
opposite—it subjects H–2A users to a private
right of action in federal court.
Those who use the H–2A program have re-
quested that control of the program be placed
with the cabinet agency that understand grow-
ers, their needs, and their processes. H.R.
5038 doesn’t do that.
The agricultural industry has asked that
Congress provide access to the H–2A pro-
gram for all sectors of agriculture.
H.R. 5038, however, covers the dairy indus-
try, but leaves out other important sectors like
meat and poultry processing, forestry and
aquaculture. Of course, as someone who rep-
resents a district where the poultry industry
employs over 16,000 people and is a vital part
of our economy, the fact that meat and poultry
processors are left out represents an enor-
mous problem.
H–2A users have asked for no cap on the
program. Where H.R. 5038 does provide
some visas for year-round work, it caps the
number initially at the low rate of 20,000 per
year and then reserves half of those for
dairies. So, a measly 10,000 visas per year
are provided for all other year-round agri-
culture needs. After that, the bill caps any in-
crease at 12.5 percent—yet still reserves half
for dairy.
While the 227 pages of H.R. 5038 make
many more changes to the H–2A program—
some good and some bad—one need look no
further than the first few pages to figure out
the real point of this bill: A path to citizenship
for an unknown number of illegal immigrants
who do some work in agriculture, along with
their families.
Of course, we have no idea how many peo-
ple will take advantage of this amnesty. Esti-
mates from groups like Farmworker Justice
put the number of farm workers in the U.S. at
2.4 million, while other estimates reach as
high as 2.7 million. Even at the very conserv-
ative estimate that 50 percent of farm workers
are here illegally, well over a million and a half
people will get a path to citizenship, and, be-
cause that 50 percent number is from a self-
reported survey, we can expect the number of
illegal workers is even higher than that.
What are some other concerns with H.R.
5038? The bill promotes fraudulent applica-
tions through its extremely low document
standards and the ability to withdraw a know-
ingly false application without prejudice. The
bill allows aliens with multiple DUI convictions
and charges, as well as many other mis-
demeanor convictions or charges, to get am-
nesty. It forgives Social Security fraud and re-
wards aliens who engage in such fraud with a
path to U.S. citizenship.
The bill defines a ‘‘work day’’ as only 5.75
hours long and only requires 100 of those
each year in order to get a path to citizenship.
Better yet, an alien can be exempt from one
year of work if they are a caretaker or are
pregnant. The bill doesn’t require the alien to
pay back taxes. H.R. 5038 rewards with am-
nesty those who failed to attend removal pro-
ceedings and those who were removed and il-
legally reentered America. The bill even au-
thorizes U.S. taxpayer money to help illegal

immigrants apply for amnesty and permits
DHS to loot up to $10 million from the fees
paid by those seeking legal immigration bene-
fits—such as naturalization.
There are many more provisions of this bill
that concern me. During the markup, my Judi-
ciary colleagues and I offered amendments
aimed at fixing some of these problems. Our
amendments were defeated on party line
votes.
At the outset of this Congress, I expressed
to the subcommittee chair my desire to work
together on an agricultural labor reform bill
that has a chance to be enacted. Unfortu-
nately, that didn’t happen. My offer was ig-
nored, and the bill before us is not something
I can support.
I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
Ms. GARCÍA of Texas. Madam Speaker, I
stand as an original cosponsor of the Farm
Workforce Modernization Act.
Agricultural workers are crucial to our econ-
omy and this bill would establish a legal and
reliable farm workforce.
I support this bill because it recognizes the
humanity of farmworkers and their families.
This is personal to me.
I grew up poor picking cotton in the fields of
South Texas.
I can testify firsthand about the incredibly
hard, back breaking work farm workers do, es-
pecially in the heart of South Texas.
Not much has changed since I worked in
the fields.
This bill is long overdue and would provide
farm workers with important worker protections
and legal rights that they desperately need.
Texas is home to nearly 250,000 farms and
the need for a strong agricultural workforce is
vital.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time

CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. 1790,
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution
758, I call up the conference report on
the bill (S. 1790) to authorize appropria-
tions for fiscal year 2020 for military
activities of the Department of De-
fense, for military construction, and
for defense activities of the Depart-
ment of Energy, to prescribe military
personnel strengths for such fiscal
year, and for other purposes, and ask
for its immediate consideration.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 758, the con-
ference report is considered read.
(For conference report and state-
ment, see proceedings of the House of
December 9, 2019, Book II, page H9389.)
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH)
and the gentleman from Texas (Mr.
THORNBERRY) each will control 30 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Washington.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that
all Members may have 5 legislative
days in which to revise and extend
their remarks and insert extraneous
material on the conference report to
accompany S. 1790.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Washington?
There was no objection.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.
Madam Speaker, this was not an easy
process. This is an incredibly impor-
tant piece of legislation. It authorizes
the Department of Defense. It basically
gives the authority to the men and
women who work at the Department of
Defense to implement our national se-
curity policy and defend this country.
And there is a lot of money, a lot of
policy, and a lot of people interested in
it.
We also have the problem that we
have a divided government. We have a
Republican President, a Republican
Senate, and a Democratic House, who
do not agree on a lot of issues. And
those are the issues that tend to get fo-
cused on.
But what this conference report re-
flects, for the most part, is that we do
agree on a lot; about 90 to 95 percent of
what we were negotiating there was
substantial agreement on: doing over-
sight of the Pentagon to make sure our
taxpayer dollars are well spent and to
make sure that the men and women
serving in our Armed Forces, who we
are asking to put their lives on the line
to defend our country, will have the
training, the equipment, and the sup-
port they need to carry out that mis-
sion. And there are more provisions
than I can count in this bill that help
them do just that.
We all, in a bipartisan way, should be
very proud of that accomplishment.
I think, ultimately, the biggest dif-
ference between where the Democrats
in the House were at and where the Re-
publicans in the Senate were at: We be-
lieve in more aggressive legislative
oversight, particularly when it comes
to matters of engaging in military ac-
tion.
We remain deeply concerned about
the war in Yemen. Now, it is not our
war. Saudi Arabia and, to a lesser de-
gree, the UAE are engaged in that, but
we do support them. We want to make
sure that we are not supporting them
in a way that is contrary to our values
and contrary to peace in the region.
Regrettably, we were not able to get
the President, primarily, to agree on
that, but I think it is something we
need to continue to put pressure on.
We also believe that we shouldn’t go
to war without congressional author-
ity. We will continue to fight about
that. We have the 2001 AUMF and the
2002 AUMF still on the books 17, 18
years later. We need to update that. We
need to make sure that we don’t go to
war with Iran without authorization.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself an additional 30
seconds.
All of that said, ultimately, we
pulled together what is an excellent
piece of legislation. The two big things
I want to highlight in the moments I
have left:
We finally repealed the widow’s tax.
After 25 years of claiming we were
going to do it, this bill does it.
And we also give paid parental leave
for all Federal employees.
I believe both of these things are in-
tegral to national defense. The people
are the ones who give us the national
security. Taking care of widows, tak-
ing care of employees is incredibly im-
portant. It was not easy to do. We did
it in this bill.
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of
the conference report, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker,
I yield myself 3 minutes.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
this conference report. The most im-
portant thing I can say about it is that
it is good for the troops and it is good
for national security. And when it
comes to a Defense authorization bill,
that is all that really matters. This is
a good bill, and it deserves the support
of everyone in the House.
And a lot of credit—much of the cred-
it—for navigating a very difficult polit-
ical process goes to Chairman SMITH
for getting us to this point. I am also
grateful to Chairman INHOFE and Sen-
ator REED during these final negotia-
tions over the last 5 months as we have
worked our way through a host of
issues.
But it is also all of the conferees and
members of the Armed Services Com-
mittee and, especially, the staff who
have had to help us work our way
through these things, essentially, all
year. And it is a credit to all of them
that we are in this place.
Madam Speaker, this bill does a lot,
as Chairman SMITH just said, for the
men and women who serve and their
families.
There is a lot of focus on people here:
For example, 3.1 percent pay raise; a
number of provisions related to
childcare for the military; increase in
professional license fees for spouses;
military housing reform, including a
requirement for a tenant Bill of Rights;
reforms to the movement of household
goods; additional steps to combat sex-
ual assault and harassment; a number
of provisions related to military
healthcare, to improve the quality of
care that they get; compensation for
medical malpractice at military treat-
ment facilities; repeal of the widow’s
tax, which is something that Congress-
man JOE WILSON, among others, has
been pushing for for a number of years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10083
December 11, 2019
Those are just some of the things re-
lated to our military folks that are in
this bill, and, essentially, I can’t think
of another significant issue military
families have brought up to me over
the past year or two or three that does
not have at least some provision in this
bill.
And, in addition, for the civilians at
DOD and the rest of the government, it
has paid parental leave so that we can
be in a better position to compete with
big employers around the country.
A lot for our people.
In addition, it does a lot to help re-
build and repair the damage that is
done by sequestration to our military.
It helps us prepare for our adversaries:
very importantly, to authorize in title
10 a space force, as this House has
voted for twice, including 2 years ago.
Yet, now, with this bill, it takes effect.
As well as further reforms to the
Pentagon, not just to get more value
out of our money, but to get top tech-
nology into the hands of the war fight-
er faster.
There is a lot of good in here, and it
deserves Member support.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
b 1600
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. COOPER),
the chair of the Subcommittee on Stra-
tegic Forces.
Mr. COOPER. Madam Speaker, we
need to establish a Space Force, to
keep GPS safe, to keep ATMs safe, and
to keep Y-O-U safe.
Space Force is not a Trump idea.
True, he tried to hijack it long after
the House Armed Services Committee
had voted on a totally bipartisan and
nearly unanimous basis to support a
Space Corps. Trump’s belated support
for a Space Force does not make this a
Republican idea.
Focus on space has been bipartisan
since the first Pentagon Space Com-
mand in 1985, an initiative that was
terminated in 2002 when America got
distracted by the war on terror. Our ad-
versaries and potential adversaries
were not distracted, however.
Since 2002, they have relentlessly
pursued anti-U.S. strategies against
our defenseless satellites. They have
made space a warfighting domain.
On behalf of the free world, we must
respond. What is the difference between
a Space Corps and a Space Force? One
word. The language in this year’s
NDAA is primarily the old Space Corps
language, which passed the HASC this
year unanimously.
The Strategic Forces Subcommittee
provisions of this bill support the core
mission of our nuclear forces to provide
a strong deterrent. They also support
nuclear safety as we modernize and re-
capitalize our nuclear deterrent.
We emphasize the importance of stra-
tegic stability. The conference agree-
ment highlights the importance of New
START and the Open Skies treaties for
U.S. and international security. We
maintain congressional oversight over
these key arms control agreements, in-
cluding requiring a 120-day notice pro-
vision before any withdrawal from
these treaties.
U.S. leadership, in cooperation with
our allies, is essential to hold Russia
accountable and to prevent an arms
race.
The NDAA continues to support ef-
fective missile defense while increasing
oversight of critical programs, particu-
larly as the Department of Defense
considers new options for the next-gen-
eration interceptor.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker,
I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. TURNER).
Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, I sup-
port the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2020, and I,
too, thank ADAM SMITH for his leader-
ship in bringing a bipartisan bill as the
final NDAA to this floor.
This bill continues the deployment of
low-yield nuclear weapons to counter
Russian violations of the INF. It also
supports our nuclear modernization ef-
forts in the DOD and the National Nu-
clear Security Administration to en-
sure a strong nuclear deterrent.
I also want to note the strong bipar-
tisan support for missile defense that is
in this year’s bill. This year’s bill dem-
onstrates that the protection of our
homeland from North Korean missile
defense is not subject to partisan poli-
tics.
As co-chair of the Congressional
Military Sexual Assault Prevention
Caucus, along with my colleague and
friend SUSAN DAVIS, I am proud of the
steps this conference report takes to
further our mission of reducing in-
stances of sexual assault in our ranks
and caring for the victims of such acts.
The conference report includes provi-
sions to improve the safety of military
housing. Adding to enhancements in-
cluded in the last year’s NDAA, the re-
port expands the requirement for fall
prevention devices installed on the
windows of base housing to protect the
young children of our servicemembers.
The fiscal year 2020 NDAA provides
the members of the Armed Services
their largest pay increase in over a dec-
ade and also includes the repeal of the
widow’s tax over the next 3 years, a
crusade by Congressman JOE WILSON.
It doubles the reimbursement allow-
ance for licensure and certification
costs of a spouse of a servicemember
arising from relocation and gives mem-
bers of the Federal Government, in-
cluding military members and Federal
Government workers, 12 weeks of paid
family leave to care for newborn or
adopted children.
I encourage passage of this bill.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 min-
utes to the gentleman from New Jersey
(Mr. NORCROSS), chair of the Sub-
committee on Tactical Air and Land
Forces.
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I
thank the chairman for yielding, for
his leadership through this tough con-
ference, and for bringing this bill to
the floor.
Madam Speaker, this bill continues
the Tactical Air and Land Forces Sub-
committee’s long tradition of bipar-
tisan work to make America’s land and
air forces the best in the world.
I also thank our subcommittee rank-
ing member, Mrs. HARTZLER, for her
commitment and contributions to this
process and upholding that tradition of
bipartisan work.
Our cooperation has kept us focused
on what is truly important. We have
delivered a defense bill that addresses
the modernization and readiness re-
quirement of our Nation’s air and land
forces.
At the same time, this bill includes
bipartisan provisions that allow for ag-
gressive oversight of the Department’s
largest and most complex, expensive,
and risky programs to protect the tax-
payer and support our military.
This bill also manages risk in our
American defense industrial base by
providing additional funds for the
Army Chinook helicopter, armored ve-
hicles, and trucks.
This bill includes long-overdue
changes that improve the quality of
life for our men and women in uniform,
the workforce that supports them, and
the families who serve right beside
them. This bill provides 12 weeks paid
parental leave for those workers across
the Federal Government and includes a
3.1 percent pay increase for our mili-
tary servicemembers.
Additionally, the bill provides health
protections for military families and
retirees from exposure to the poten-
tially cancer-causing contaminate
PFAS. This also includes ensuring that
blood tests are conducted for our fire-
fighters on military bases who might
have been exposed.
I am proud of the hard work that this
committee has done to serve America’s
national security interests, and I urge
my colleagues to support it.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker,
I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from Virginia (Mr.
WITTMAN).
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I
thank Mr. THORNBERRY for yielding.
Madam Speaker, this is not a good
conference report. This is a great bi-
partisan conference report. We have
made significant strides in a wide
range of areas that improve our na-
tional security posture, from installing
a respectable $743 billion top line to
supporting our Nation’s highest acqui-
sition priorities to even including re-
lated efforts on the widow’s tax and
family housing reform. This has be-
come an impressive bill.
I must admit, though, that I was con-
cerned about our ability to complete
the work in this conference report.
When we initially debated this bill on
the House floor, I voted in opposition
to the bill over top-line funding issues
and various riders that were included.

H10084 December 11, 2019
But in conference, we debated vigor-
ously. In the end, I am pleased that we,
once again, tacked to the middle and
moved to garner bipartisan support for
our servicemembers and their families.
Chairman SMITH and Ranking Mem-
ber THORNBERRY should be proud of
this effort. Our seapower and projec-
tion capabilities are more lethal as a
result.
In the Seapower and Projection
Forces Subcommittee, we authorized
three destroyers, two submarines, two
amphibious ships, two oilers, and one
frigate. We accelerate unmanned ves-
sels to the maximum sustainable level.
We continue to fully support the rapid
development of the B–22 Raider bomber
and the Columbia-class ballistic mis-
sile submarine programs, both essen-
tial elements of our nuclear triad.
In my estimation, this conference re-
port is making the right investments
to ensure our military is more effective
and has the ability to project power in
times of conflict.
I particularly appreciate Chairman
COURTNEY’s approach to developing bi-
partisan legislation. I am glad that we
are so closely aligned in our sub-
committee, and I thank Chairman
COURTNEY for his leadership.
Additionally, the conference report
makes significant progress on a mul-
titude of family policy issues that are
essential to supporting our service-
members and their families.
A 3.1 percent military pay raise; sig-
nificant improvements in family hous-
ing; authorizing paid parental leave,
including Mr. WILSON’s legislation to
address the widow’s tax—all of these
provisions support and retain our mili-
tary families.
We are concluding our defense policy
bill, but now it is time to move the De-
fense appropriations processes.
While I am excited to support this con-
ference report, I also believe that we need to
rapidly advance our efforts to conclude the de-
fense appropriations process. I think it is em-
barrassing for Congress to go home for all of
August and early September with the com-
plete understanding that our ineffectiveness
wastes billions of dollars and weakens our na-
tional security. We can do better. We must do
better.
We are concluding our defense policy bill,
but now it is time to move the defense appro-
priations process.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 min-
utes to the gentleman from Con-
necticut (Mr. COURTNEY), the chair of
the Subcommittee on Seapower and
Projection Forces.
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I
rise in strong support of the final con-
ference version of the 2020 National De-
fense Authorization Act.
As chairman of the Seapower and
Projection Forces Subcommittee, I
worked closely with my colleague and
friend, Ranking Member WITTMAN, to
produce a strong bill that invests
smartly in the defense priorities under
our jurisdiction.
This year, we also benefited greatly
from the contributions of our freshman
members of the subcommittee, whose
collective experience and intelligence
were extremely helpful.
The bill authorizes a $23 billion ship-
building budget for 12 battle force
ships, including two Virginia-class sub-
marines, three Arleigh Burke destroy-
ers, the first frigate, two amphibious
ships, two T-AO oilers, and two salvage
and rescue ships.
The final shipbuilding budget also
contains adjustments necessary to sup-
port the new Block V Virginia-class
submarine contract and fully funds the
Navy’s number one acquisition pri-
ority, the Columbia-class ballistic mis-
sile submarine.
This bill will, by law, reverse the ad-
ministration’s misguided proposal to
cancel the refueling of the carrier USS
Harry S. Truman.
Our subcommittee also focused on
sealift recapitalization, an area that
has been overlooked for far too long;
legislating reauthorization of the Mari-
time Security Program; establishing a
new-build domestic sealift vessel pro-
gram; and restoring funding cuts by
the administration for a critical train-
ing platform, the National Security
Multi-Mission Vessel.
It also provides strong support for
our air projection forces, including the
KC–46 tanker, the B–21 long-range
bomber, and the B–52 reengining pro-
gram.
Finally, we continued Congress’ over-
sight duties as they relate to the
Navy’s surface fleet readiness by re-
quiring any shipboard system program
of record to have formal associated
training to ensure our sailors are com-
petent operators of the equipment they
use at sea every day.
Outside of seapower, I am extremely
pleased that my amendment that re-
verses last year’s awful DOD order
blocking longer term servicemembers’
ability to transfer their GI Bill edu-
cational benefits to eligible dependents
is in the conference report.
I am also pleased about the fix to
widow’s tax, which we wrestled with
for 20 years, and also the monumental
task of providing 12 weeks of paid fam-
ily medical leave for all Federal em-
ployees.
I thank the committee leadership,
Representatives SMITH and THORN-
BERRY, for their tireless work. I also
thank Phil MacNaughton, Dave
Sienicki, Kelly Goggin, and Megan
Handal, and Lieutenant Claire Wardius
of the Navy, my Navy fellow, for their
great work supporting this bill.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker,
I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the
distinguished gentlewoman from Mis-
souri (Mrs. HARTZLER).
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I
rise in strong support of the conference
report to accompany S. 1790, the 59th
consecutive National Defense Author-
ization Act.
With a new top line of $739 billion,
plus another $5.3 billion in emergency
authorizations, I believe this con-
ference report now represents a good
bipartisan compromise that we all
should support because it provides for
our common defense and addresses the
priorities required by our men and
women in uniform.
This bill will continue the progress
we have made in rebuilding military
readiness while also setting the right
conditions through oversight to accel-
erate needed modernization capabili-
ties required for the national defense
strategy and credible deterrents.
A few examples of these critical ca-
pabilities include funding for eight F–
15EX aircraft, an additional $1.4 billion
for F–35 fifth-generation Joint Strike
Fighters, funding for 24 F–18 Super
Hornets, strong support for the Army’s
identified Big 6 modernization prior-
ities, and an additional $265 million for
National Guard and Reserve Compo-
nent equipment modernization.
I am also pleased the bill includes a
provision to ensure servicemembers
forced to move from any type of mili-
tary housing, including dormitories,
receive a partial dislocation allowance.
This fixes a gap that previously prohib-
ited our lowest paid servicemembers
from receiving this assistance.
I thank Ranking Member THORN-
BERRY for his leadership and guidance
throughout this entire process, as well
as our subcommittee chairman, DON-
ALD NORCROSS, for his leadership and
spirit of bipartisan.
This conference report also wouldn’t
be possible without the hard work and
dedication of the entire subcommittee
staff.
The NDAA has always been a product
of bipartisan consensus, and I am
pleased that we were successful in
reaching that level of consensus again.
I urge my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle to support this bill and vote
‘‘yes’’ on S. 1790.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr.
GARAMENDI), who is the chairman of
the Subcommittee on Readiness.
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I
rise in full support of the National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2020.
First, I thank Chairman SMITH and
Ranking Member THORNBERRY, the
committee staff, and others who
worked tirelessly on this bill. It is a
good one, and I urge support from all.
As chairman of the Subcommittee on
Readiness, I worked closely with Mem-
bers on and off the committee to en-
sure that this bill addressed three pri-
ority areas.
First, the NDAA requires the Depart-
ment of Defense to plan for and re-
spond to the threat that climate
change poses to military installations
and military operations by developing
installation master plans that fully as-
sess current and future climate vulner-
abilities and updating building stand-
ards for military construction to pro-
mote energy conservation, climate and
cyber resiliency, among many other
important aspects.

Second, the bill includes a number of
provisions aimed at addressing prob-
lems associated with the management
and oversight of military family hous-
ing programs, including that military
services must establish a tenants’ bill
of rights for our military family hous-
ing.
Third, the bill authorizes additional
funding and includes bipartisan provi-
sions to mitigate contaminated drink-
ing water for households and agri-
culture resulting from PFAS and
fluorinated compounds that have been
used on military installations.
I am also pleased that there is a 3.1
percent pay raise for our troops and
also that the bill includes provisions
from my bill, H.R. 2617, the OATH Act,
the Occupational and Environmental
Transparency Health Act, which re-
quires the DOD input any occupational
environmental hazard that troops may
have been exposed to.
Finally, a couple of things that are
positive, but there are also some con-
cerns. The bill does not delay the de-
ployment of the new low-yield nuclear
warheads for submarines, which I be-
lieve is not a good idea at all for our
boomers. Secondly, the bill does not
deal with the funding for our military
programs and for the military that had
been ripped off for the wall.

Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker,
I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.
KELLY).
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for
yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of S. 1790, the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020.
I wish to thank Chairman SMITH,
Ranking Member THORNBERRY, Chair-
man INHOFE, and Ranking Member
REED for their leadership throughout
the conferencing of this bill.
I also want to thank the Military
Personnel Subcommittee chairwoman,
JACKIE SPEIER, for her hard work and
leadership.
The strength of our military is our
servicemembers, and the strength of
our servicemembers is our military
families. This bill contains a number of
significant policy and funding initia-
tives that affirm our commitment to
our troops and their families.
To that end, this bill supports a 3.1
percent military pay raise, extends
crucial pay and bonuses for service-
members in high-demand fields, and
eliminates the widow’s tax.
I want to specifically thank Rep-
resentative JOE WILSON for his years of
tireless work and leadership to make
this a reality. Make no mistake, this is
all because of JOE WILSON’s initiative.
This bill also preserves military
healthcare by preventing the services
from making cuts to healthcare billets
before providing additional analysis on
the impact those cuts will have on our
military health system.
It improves accessibility and effec-
tiveness of mental healthcare by re-
quiring DOD to update and standardize
procedures related to mental health
treatment and substance abuse refer-
rals.
Importantly, this bill strengthens
our Reserve component by expanding
eligibility for TRICARE Reserve Se-
lect.
This bill also expands support for
military spouses by doubling the reim-
bursement amount spouses can receive
for professional licensing and expand-
ing eligibility for educational assist-
ance.
Finally, the bill includes provisions
designed to improve military childcare,
including expanded direct hiring au-
thority for child development centers
and requiring a comprehensive assess-
ment of childcare capacity on military
installations.
In addition to critical military per-
sonnel provisions, this bill contains
many initiatives that are important to
my home State of Mississippi.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my
fellow conferrees for their contribu-
tions to this truly bipartisan con-
ference report, and I strongly urge my
colleagues to support its passage.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER),
who is the chairman of the Sub-
committee on Military Personnel.
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, let me
also say to my colleague, the chair of
the committee, what an outstanding
job he has done. I want to thank my
ranking member, Mr. KELLY, for his
good leadership as well.
Since coming to Congress, I have
voted against more NDAAs than I have
voted for. This year, I will be voting for
the NDAA, not because it is perfect,
not because it achieves every Demo-
cratic priority, and not because I am
satisfied. I am voting for this bill be-
cause it achieves monumental progres-
sive victories; and the day after the
President signs this bill, many of our
servicemembers and their families will
recognize that we have been listening
to them.
Let me highlight a few provisions
that make me proud to vote for this
bill.
After 70 years, we have tackled the
Feres doctrine, setting aside $400 mil-
lion over 10 years to provide justice
and compensation for medical mal-
practice performed at noncombat set-
tings.
The process of providing compensa-
tion for malpractice during nonmission
healthcare should be governed by the
Administrative Procedure Act, guaran-
teeing a public comment process for
creating the program plus judicial re-
view.
We required the Marine Corps to join
the rest of the services and finally pro-
vide gender-integrated basic training
to platoons, recognizing that women
marines are marines just like men.
We have ended the unjust widow’s
tax, provided 12 weeks of paid parental
leave to Federal workers, increased re-
sources to ease the childcare backlog
at military bases, provided legal coun-
sel to domestic violence survivors, and
prevented the military from forcing
new mothers to deploy within a year of
their child’s birth.
Finally, we have renewed the Breast
Cancer Research Stamp Act, which has
been generating $85 million for breast
cancer research.
The NDAA is not perfect, but it is a
giant step forward for our servicemem-
bers and their families.
I want to thank Craig Greene, Dave
Giachetti, Glen Diehl, and Jamie Jack-
son for the outstanding services they
have provided to the Military Per-
sonnel Subcommittee, and I urge my
colleagues to vote in favor of this
measure.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker,
I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentlewoman from New York (Ms.
STEFANIK).
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I
rise in strong support of this bipartisan
bill and the accompanying conference
report for the National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020.
As the ranking member of the Sub-
committee on Intelligence and Emerg-
ing Threats and Capabilities, I am
proud of our oversight and legislative
activities this year.
The bill before the House incor-
porates four broad subcommittee
themes.
First, it recharges our national secu-
rity innovation base to confront
emerging threats and advance our
science and technology ecosystem,
while also making it easier for small
businesses to engage with DOD. We au-
thorize the establishment of new part-
nerships in the field of hypersonics and
quantum sciences. We extend unique
hiring authorities to the Joint AI Cen-
ter and to DARPA to ensure that the
best talent available is made available
to solve our hardest national security
problems. This bill also establishes a
White House working group to protect
Federal research and intellectual prop-
erty from foreign interference, espio-
nage, and theft.
Second, this bill recognizes the ur-
gency and importance of U.S. leader-
ship in 5G technology and mandates
the development of a DOD 5G strategy.
Third, this NDAA strengthens con-
gressional oversight of cyber oper-
ations and enhances the Department’s
cybersecurity strategy and cyber war-
fare capabilities. It builds upon the
work of previous NDAAs to ensure
cyber is a fully integrated warfighting
function across the Department. It in-
creases congressional notification re-
quirements for military cyber oper-
ations and improves cybersecurity co-
operation with the Defense industrial
base.
Finally, this bill contains important
authorities for sensitive military oper-
ations and activities, including cyber,
counterterrorism, and intelligence.
These authorities are vital to meet the

threats identified in the National De-
fense Strategy.
Before I conclude, I would like to
thank Ranking Member THORNBERRY,
Chairman SMITH, Senator INHOFE, and
Senator REED for their leadership
through this conference process.
I particularly want to thank my
partner and the subcommittee chair,
Congressman JIM LANGEVIN from
Rhode Island, for his strong partner-
ship and what we have delivered from
this subcommittee.
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island (Mr.
LANGEVIN), who is the chair of the Sub-
committee on Intelligence and Emerg-
ing Threats and Capabilities.
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I
want to thank the gentleman for yield-
ing, and I want to congratulate and
thank Chairman SMITH for his leader-
ship on the House Armed Services
Committee, as well as Ranking Mem-
ber THORNBERRY.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in
strong support of the conference report
to accompany the 2020 National De-
fense Authorization Act. I was honored
to be a conferree, and I am very proud
that we have concluded our work on
this defense bill and reached bipartisan
consensus in support of our national
security and our servicemembers. I am
particularly pleased with the provi-
sions that are under the oversight of
the Intelligence and Emerging Threats
and Capabilities Subcommittee, which
I am honored to chair.
I also want to thank my sub-
committee ranking member, Ms.
STEFANIK, for her contributions to this
bill and her bipartisan participation
and partnership throughout the proc-
ess, and our wonderful staff for all
their work to make this happen.
In the IETC portfolio, this bill sup-
ports a robust Department of Defense
science and technology ecosystem to
deliver the best capabilities to the
warfighter while protecting critical
technologies. It provides for additional
investments in emerging technologies
like 5G and additive manufacturing
and supports educational programs to
strengthen the STEM workforce and
improve ties with historically Black
colleges and universities and minority-
serving institutions.
On the cybersecurity front, we
strengthen oversight of military oper-
ations, synchronize efforts, and lever-
age best practices to improve the De-
partment’s network, industrial base,
and military installation
cybersecurity.
This bill also reflects our IETC prior-
ities that Special Operations Forces re-
main professional, ethical, agile, and
postured for high-end missions and
that the Defense Intelligence Enter-
prise is oriented to provide maximum
support to Department requirements.
I am especially pleased that this bill
continues to support the production of
the Virginia-class submarine program
and the Virginia Payload Modules as
well as the Columbia-class submarine
program, which are shining examples
of Rhode Island’s contributions to our
national security.
This bill supports our servicemem-
bers with a pay raise and demonstrates
a strong commitment, also, to families
by providing all Federal workers with
paid parental leave.
Madam Speaker, there is a lot to be
proud of in this bill. I thank Chairman
SMITH, again, for his leadership and
Ranking Member THORNBERRY, and I
urge my colleagues to support it.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker,
I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from Colorado (Mr.
LAMBORN).
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding and
for his leadership.
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the conference report for the
National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2020.
The NDAA continues rebuilding read-
iness and provides vital capabilities re-
quired to implement the National De-
fense Strategy.
Highlights include significant invest-
ments in operations and maintenance,
facilities, sustainment, and military
construction; also, nuclear triad mod-
ernization and authority to deploy low-
yield weapons; the historic establish-
ment of Space Force as a separate mili-
tary service with a seat on the Joint
Chiefs of Staff; and $5.3 billion in emer-
gency funding to rebuild Tyndall and
Offutt Air Force Bases, Camp Lejeune,
and China Lake Naval Air Station, all
of which were struck by natural disas-
ters.
The stress that military families en-
dure from frequent deployments makes
the systemic failures of privatized
military family housing truly deplor-
able. Critical reforms in this bill in-
clude a Tenants Bill of Rights, formal
dispute resolution, and improved qual-
ity control for repairs and mold reme-
diation.
The bill also provides critical over-
sight of the Defense household goods
program that will ensure that military
families are put first in DOD reforms.
The bill also addresses PFAS con-
tamination by prohibiting non-
emergency use of firefighting foams
containing PFOS and PFOA and re-
quires DOD to accelerate fielding a
PFAS-free replacement.
I want to thank Readiness Sub-
committee Chairman JOHN GARAMENDI
for his leadership.
Chairman SMITH and Ranking Mem-
ber THORNBERRY also deserve great rec-
ognition for preserving the commit-
tee’s 59-year bipartisan tradition of
passing the NDAA to support our
warfighters and their families.
I want to thank the professional staff
who worked tirelessly to complete this
important legislation.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the conference re-
port.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. KHANNA).
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I rise
in strong opposition to this defense au-
thorization.
There are many things that you can
call the bill, but it is Orwellian to call
it progressive. Let’s speak in facts.
When President Obama left, the de-
fense budget was $618 billion. This de-
fense budget is $120 billion more than
what President Obama left us with.
That could fund free public college for
every American. It could fund access to
high-speed, affordable internet for
every American.
But it is worse: the bipartisan provi-
sion to stop the war in Yemen, stripped
by the White House; the bipartisan
amendment to stop the war in Iran,
stripped by the White House; the bipar-
tisan provision to repeal the 2002
George W. Bush authorization for the
war in Iraq which is sending our troops
overseas, stripped by the White House.
At some time, we can’t just rhetori-
cally give standing ovations when the
President says that we are going to end
endless wars and continue to vote to
fund them.
It wasn’t just President George W.
Bush who committed the biggest blun-
der of foreign policy in the 21st century
by sending us to Iraq. It was the abdi-
cation of this body, with many Mem-
bers of Congress who voted right with
him.
My question is: When are we going to
listen to the American people? When
are we going to do our Article I duty
and stop funding these endless wars
and start funding our domestic prior-
ities?

Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker,
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman
from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON), who
is the distinguished author of legisla-
tion with 383 cosponsors to repeal the
widow’s tax that is now a part of this
legislation.
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.
Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking
Member THORNBERRY and Chairman
SMITH.
Madam Speaker, I am grateful that
the House and Senate have come to an
agreement in this year’s National De-
fense Authorization Act conference re-
port to finally repeal the widow’s tax.
I appreciate my predecessor, the late
Chairman Floyd Spence, who was one
of the earliest proponents of elimi-
nating the widow’s tax, and I picked up
on his efforts upon my election in 2001.
Being the lead sponsor of this bill will
always be meaningful to me.
I made every effort to be bipartisan,
always inviting all cosponsors of both
parties to milestone achievements. Re-
pealing the widow’s tax has been per-
sonal to me.

their three children, Hayden, Grace,
and Meghan, have always been on my
mind and in my heart as we fought for
the repeal of the widow’s tax.
This legislation has the support of
383 Members in the House. This bill
that is included in NDAA, has the larg-
est number of cosponsors of any bill in
the House of Representatives this Con-
gress. I welcomed Congressman JOHN
YARMUTH to be the first cosponsor with
the intention of always being bipar-
tisan. This provision will restore the
full amount of the survivor benefit an-
nuity to more than 65,000 surviving
military families. The repeal of the
widow’s tax will impact families who
could receive an average of almost
$12,000 a year. Surviving spouses vis-
ited and called representatives and
were very convincing.
This effectiveness was truly remark-
able, and I commend Edith Smith, Barb
Christie, Kathy Prout, Kathy Thorpe,
Kristy DiDomenico, and Kristin Fenty
for their perseverance. Veterans serv-
ice organizations were also instru-
mental. I am thankful that the fami-
lies who have given the greatest sac-
rifice in service to our country are no
longer burdened by this unfair offset.
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members
to vote in support of the NDAA con-
ference report.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.
Madam Speaker, I just point out that
there was nothing in the House bill or
any bill that would have ended the war
in Yemen. It is not just Orwellian to
say that. It is breathtakingly dishonest
to tell people out there that there was
something we could have done to end
the war in Yemen. We need to work
hard to bring a peaceful solution to
that conflict. Being dishonest with the
American public does not accomplish
that.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.
BROWN).
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam
Speaker, I thank Chairman SMITH for
his hard work, as well as the com-
mittee staff on an NDAA that affirms
our values and delivers progressive
wins for the American people.
The NDAA tackles the pressing secu-
rity challenges facing our country and
makes important investments in our
warfighters and their families.
We confront Russian aggression by
bolstering the European Deterrence
Initiative and providing our allies in
Ukraine with additional military sup-
port.
We make a commitment to a diverse
and inclusive military by: Increasing
defense spending at historically Black
colleges and universities; incentivizing
more minority and women-owned busi-
nesses to be part of our defense indus-
trial base; and finally, gender inte-
grating basic training for the Marine
Corps.
This NDAA makes good on the com-
mitments to address serious problems
with private military housing; and give
military families a pathway to seek
justice, if they suffer from medical
malpractice.
Yet, this NDAA is also a compromise.
I am disappointed that we couldn’t re-
verse the President’s ban on
transgender servicemembers or force
Congress to reconsider the 2001 AUMF.
But ultimately, this NDAA gets the job
done, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port it.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker,
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman
from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS), the co-
author, along with Mr. COOPER of the
Space Force provision.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam
Speaker, I thank Ranking Member
THORNBERRY and Chairman SMITH for
their leadership in bringing this con-
ference report to the floor.
I am very pleased that Space Force,
an issue that my good friend, JIM COO-
PER, and I have been working on for
several years, is finally becoming a re-
ality. This report establishes the U.S.
Space Force in title 10 as the sixth
Armed Service of the United States
under the Department of the Air Force.
It is the first new branch of the mili-
tary since 1947.
It also recognizes space as a
warfighting domain and authorizes the
transfer of Air Force personnel to the
newly established Space Force. This is
an important step for our national se-
curity. Our adversaries are moving
quickly in space, and this new service
will allow us to quickly realign our re-
sources and efforts towards countering
them.
Finally, the original House-passed
NDAA that every Republican opposed,
included a number of open border pro-
visions that would have undermined
our efforts to secure our Southwest
border. I am pleased that those unrea-
sonable border security restrictions
have been removed.
Madam Speaker, this is a strong de-
fense bill, and I urge the House to sup-
port this legislation.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Mrs. CARO-
LYN B. MALONEY).
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Madam Speaker, I rise in support
of this NDAA conference report, and
particularly for its inclusion of lan-
guage from my bill, the Federal Em-
ployee Paid Leave Act. This provision
will provide 12 weeks paid parental
leave for all Federal employees for the
birth of a child or adoption of a child.
For far too long, the United States
has been behind the times. There are
only two countries in the entire world,
according to a United Nations’ study,
that do not provide paid parental leave
for the birth of a child, and those two
countries are the United States and
Papua New Guinea.
When we pass this National Defense
Authorization Act, we will no longer be
part of that infamous group. I thank,
from the bottom of my heart, chairman
of the House Committee on Armed
Services, ADAM SMITH, who worked
selflessly and tirelessly with great de-
termination to include this provision
that will help over 2.1 million Federal
employees. It will turn this priority of
balance in family life into a reality in
millions of families’ lives. I also thank
my friend and colleague, Congress-
woman CHRISSY HOULAHAN from Penn-
sylvania, for her partnership on this ef-
fort.
While this agreement is not perfect,
it is an extraordinary first step toward
full paid family and medical leave for
all American workers. By providing
this leave, studies indicate we could
prevent the departure of over 2,600 fe-
male employees per year and save the
government $50 million per year in
costs associated with employee turn-
over. On top of that, paid family leave
also improves productivity, boosts mo-
rale, and attracts more talent. It also
provides a benefit to families and the
broader economy.
Paid parental leave is an investment
in our future in American families and
the workforce. And that is why I am
urging all of my colleagues to support
the NDAA, which includes this impor-
tant provision.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker,
I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from Florida (Mr. WALTZ).
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise
in support of this defense bill because
we are a nation at war.
We are in a hot war with extremists
around the world, and we are in a cold
war with our peer competitors, Russian
and China and other rogue states.
And Madam Speaker, if the country
isn’t safe, everything else that we do in
this body is secondary. Our domestic
priorities, our economy, our education,
trade, everything else that we debate
in this Congress is at risk if we fail to
protect this great Nation.
One of the reasons that I ran for
elected office, was that often what
comes out of Washington isn’t worthy
of our previous veterans, my fellow
special operators around the world, as
we speak, and other military currently
deployed, and it is not worthy of their
families and the sacrifices of their fam-
ilies.
This defense bill, from the sixth
branch of the military and the Space
Force, to childcare for Gold Star fami-
lies, it is worthy. It is worthy of their
sacrifice, past and present.
I deeply and personally thank the
chairman, ADAM SMITH. I thank the
ranking member, Mr. THORNBERRY, and
everyone else who stepped up, frankly,
and all of my colleagues who stepped
up to make the compromises necessary
to pass this critical piece of legislation
to be worthy of those who have sac-
rificed for all of us breathing free air
today.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support it. It is worthy of
them, as we all are with this bill.

the distinguished chairman of the
House Intelligence Committee.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding, and
rise in support of the fiscal 2020 NDAA
conference report.
This legislation supports our na-
tional security and it also accom-
plishes long-sought Democratic prior-
ities, like extending paid paternal
leave to over 2 million Federal employ-
ees. I hope that this achievement will
pave the way to making paid paternal
leave the norm across the workforce.
I am very pleased that as a part of
this legislation, we are also passing the
fiscal year 2018, 2019, and 2020 Intel-
ligence Authorization Acts, aptly
named in honor of HPSCI’s Damon Nel-
son and SSCI’s Matt Pollard, two dedi-
cated staffers who tragically passed
away last year.
The Intelligence Authorization Act is
the primary legislative product of the
Committee on Intelligence and secur-
ing its passage into law after it passed
the House with nearly 400 votes,
strengthens our oversight of the intel-
ligence community and military intel-
ligence immeasurably.
I am also proud that the IAA in-
cludes many vital important provi-
sions; among them, protecting our
elections from foreign interference, un-
derstanding and mitigating the effects
of climate change, and a competition
to improve Deepfake detection.
While I support the bill, it is a bitter
pill that bipartisan House amendments
to finally fix the injustice that has
kept 74 sailors who died aboard the
USS Frank E. Evans in 1969 off the Viet-
nam Memorial was removed from the
conference report. I will not relent on
that issue until we get it done.
I am also disappointed that the re-
peal of the 2002 AUMF was removed.
There is no reasonable basis to keep
this outdated authorization in effect.
Nevertheless, I congratulate the
chair and ranking member on their
good work. And I personally thank all
of the members of the Intelligence
Committee’s staff for the extraor-
dinary work that the staff did for many
years on this legislation.
I thank my fellow members of the in-
telligence community as well. We have
worked now for 3 years to reach this
point. I am very grateful that these im-
portant provisions will now pass into
law.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker,
I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS).
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I
thank Ranking Member THORNBERRY
and Chairman SMITH. I say a special
thank you to Mr. THORNBERRY and his
staff. They have been great partners in
this journey of addressing PFAS in the
NDAA.
First and foremost, I am pleased that
we have reached a deal on the funding
of our Armed Services. Ensuring appro-
priate and sufficient resources for our
men and women who serve on the
frontline every day should be our top
priority.
Having said that, I am disappointed
about two provisions that did not get
in. One would have required EPA to set
a national drinking water standard on
PFOA and PFOS within 2 years. And
the second one would have instituted a
mandate on DOD to clean up imme-
diately any DOD sites contaminated
with PFOA or PFOS.
Republican Members supported these
two provisions as part of a larger pack-
age, and I think not including them
amounts to a very great lost oppor-
tunity.
Nonetheless, I support the NDAA and
PFAS provisions that we were able to
get into the bill. Those provisions in-
clude:
Mr. UPTON’s Federal facilities and co-
operative agreements;
Funding for reducing PFAS and rural
economically disadvantaged drinking
water systems;
Health data collection from PFAS
manufacturers under TSCA;
Guidance on proper disposal of PFAS
chemicals;
More reporting on PFAS chemicals
on the Toxic Release Inventory; and
Funding for further research into
PFAS chemicals.
As my Republican colleagues on the
Committee on Energy and Commerce
discussed at a recent markup, getting
PFAS provisions into the NDAA means
that they will be signed into law and
will start making a difference in our
communities back home right now.
I urge my colleagues to vote for this
important bill.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. LEE).
Ms. LEE of California. Madam
Speaker, first of all, I thank the chair-
man for his leadership and for ensuring
paid parental leave for Federal employ-
ees.
I strongly support this and many
other provisions in this bill. Unfortu-
nately, this bill does not include very
important provisions, such as the pro-
vision to end support for the Saudi-led
coalition in Yemen, and two provisions
I fought to include that would help end
our forever wars.
The first is the repeal of the 2001 au-
thorization to use military force,
which is a blank check for endless war.
The second is the repeal of the 2002
AUMF. The House passed my amend-
ment to repeal the 2002 AUMF. It
makes absolutely no sense that this
outdated AUMF still exists. We must
restore some congressional authority
on matters of war and peace and finally
repeal these AUMFs.
Also, I encourage my colleagues to
read The Washington Post’s recently
published ‘‘Afghanistan Papers,’’ if
they need any more justification for
why Congress must reassert itself in
matters of war and peace. I can tell
you, it is an appalling and shocking
read.
Finally, the bill before us authorizes
a Pentagon budget of about $733 bil-
lion, which is the largest ever author-
ized. Given the waste, fraud, and abuse
at the Pentagon, the failure of the Pen-
tagon to pass an even basic audit, and
the unnecessary spending, I am simply
unable to support this bill.
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair-
man for his work, and I thank him for
yielding.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker,
I have no further speakers at this time,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. YARMUTH).
b 1645
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in support of the NDAA con-
ference report, which includes the
phaseout of the offset provision known
as the widow’s tax.
Ending this egregious offset is a mo-
mentous victory for the more than
60,000 surviving spouses and families of
our Nation’s fallen heroes and the fam-
ilies who, unfortunately, may come
after them.
It is not every day that Congress
comes together and fixes a problem
that has been on the books for more
than four decades, but that day is here.
I got involved in this issue years ago
when I heard from my constituent
Ellen, a woman in Louisville whose
husband tragically passed away during
training exercises.
When I became the Democratic lead
on legislation to repeal this offset,
along with Congressman WILSON of
South Carolina, I was told it would
never pass, that people had tried for
years and had failed every time. Well,
here we are. We got it done.
Chairman SMITH and I, with the help
of Chairman MCGOVERN and Speaker
PELOSI, came up with a plan to add the
offset repeal to the must-pass NDAA
bill and then worked our tails off to
keep it there.
We knew if it passed the House as a
freestanding piece of legislation, it
would land in the stack of bills of more
than 270 bipartisan bills languishing on
MITCH MCCONNELL’s desk and would
never be seen again.
So I thank Chairman SMITH for his
dedication on behalf of families whose
loved once made the ultimate sacrifice
on behalf our Nation.
I would also like to thank the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. WIL-
SON) for his long-time passionate lead-
ership on this issue.
But most of all, I want to thank my
constituent Ellen and all the surviving
spouses who fought for this moment for
years, who lit up phone lines, flooded
email inboxes, walked the Halls of Con-
gress, and demanded we act. Your fall-
en loved ones would be so proud of
what you have accomplished in their
honor.
Now it is time for Congress to honor
them as well by passing this legisla-
tion.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker,
I continue to reserve the balance of my
time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10089
December 11, 2019
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB).
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I thank
the good gentleman for all his incred-
ible work as chairman. I know it is dif-
ficult and it was the best that we could
do, especially with so much opposition
on the Senate side.
But as a voice and advocate for a dis-
trict that encompasses frontline com-
munities facing concentrated poverty,
growing healthcare costs, decreasing
education funding, and continuous as-
saults on our environment, I could not
support and cannot support a bill that
provides $738 billion for wars and de-
fense contractors while, this year, we
only provided $190 billion in discre-
tionary funding for healthcare, edu-
cation, antipoverty programs, and
workforce development.
After the House took action to end
U.S. involvement in the war and hu-
manitarian crisis in Yemen, this NDAA
fails to include necessary provisions to
end the U.S. support for military ac-
tion in Yemen.
This bill also keeps Guantanamo Bay
open, provides for new nuclear war-
heads, and establishes the absurd Space
Force.
By removing the House’s repeal of
the Iraq war AUMF, we have also
agreed to endless war abroad.
By removing language that would
have stopped, Madam Speaker, Pen-
tagon spending at Trump hotels and
properties, we are authorizing corrup-
tion.
By removing critical PFAS protec-
tions, we have also left our commu-
nities at risk.
So I am asking my colleagues to
please not rubberstamp this annual in-
crease of the world’s largest military
budget. We can do better.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER),
the distinguished majority leader.
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I want
to thank the ranking member for his
service and the chairman for his serv-
ice.
I also want to thank the staff. It has
been an extraordinarily arduous, sleep-
depriving and angst-creating process, I
know, to get this bill from this floor
over to the Senate floor and through
conference, so I congratulate the staff.
We are blessed as a country and as a
Congress to have extraordinarily quali-
fied people who could, frankly, make
very significantly more in the private
sector stick with us and with our coun-
try. Their patriotism and their talent
is an extraordinary benefit to us all.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank
Chairman SMITH and the Democratic
members and the majority staff of the
Armed Services Committee, as well as
the ranking member and the minority
staff. They have been working very
hard on this legislation.
The conference report before us rep-
resents a compromise. No one ought to
think that is a pejorative. It is what we
do. And it means, in compromising,
you do not get everything you want.
Obviously, many of the things that
we passed on the floor of this House
that we believed were very, very impor-
tant items are not in this conference
report. It could lead some to say, well,
then we won’t vote for it. That would
be a mistake on either side of the aisle.
I am particularly pleased, however,
that this report, this bill does include,
for the first time, 12 weeks of paid pa-
rental leave for the birth or adoption of
a child for all Federal civilian employ-
ees. There was, for a period of time, a
suggestion that it only apply to de-
fense employees.
I would suggest that the national se-
curity of our country is, in interrelated
ways, dependent upon all of our em-
ployees, and we ought to treat them
equally. I wrote a letter urging that,
and others weighed in as well.
I am pleased that the committee ul-
timately decided to treat all Federal
employees the same, even though we
limited it not to family leave, but to
parental leave.
Now, that is a step in the right direc-
tion. We know that the bonding be-
tween moms and dads and infant chil-
dren is critically important, and this
will give them the opportunity to do
so. And it will give them the oppor-
tunity to not have to make a deter-
mination whether or not they don’t get
paid in order to create this bond, but
they will be enabled to, as so many
could not if they were not paid, take
advantage of this benefit.
So I am disappointed that we don’t
have full coverage, but this is a first
and very significant step.
I want to congratulate the gentle-
woman from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN
B. MALONEY), who has been a giant in
her advocacy of this policy for our peo-
ple, for our employees, and, by the
way, for our infants, whether they are
adopted or whether they are naturally
born.
I will continue to fight for the full
measure of paid family and medical
leave to be extended to our employees
and would urge others around the
country to do the same. While some
private businesses are already insti-
tuting paid leave, it would be appro-
priate that all do so.
In addition, this conference report,
unfortunately, does not include a com-
prehensive set of provisions that were
adopted in this House to protect com-
munities affected by PFAS.
Now, PFAS is a category of chemi-
cals that essentially do not disappear
and are toxic when introduced into our
waters and exist on our military bases,
in some respects, because of the use of
foam for fire suppression, but for other
reasons as well.
I know that the chairman fought
very hard for this. I know that the
President’s position was that he did
not want this in the bill and indicated
that it would not happen. But I thank
Mr. SMITH for fighting so hard for this,
and I know that we will keep fighting.
I want to tell the House that I intend
to bring a bill to the floor incor-
porating the provisions that were in
the defense bill but dropped. I will
bring it to the floor in January. I have
talked to Mr. PALLONE about that, and
he is looking forward to doing just
that.
I am trying to shorten this up a little
bit, Madam Speaker.
The last two things I want to men-
tion before I make some general com-
ments is that I was sorry that the anti-
discrimination provision that was in-
cluded in this House dealing with
transgender people who wanted to
serve their country was eliminated
from the bill. I think that was wrong.
I am one of the people like John
McCain. John McCain, when asked
whether or not gays and the LGBT
community ought to be able to serve in
the military, said: I want to know
whether they shoot straight, not
whether they are straight.
Martin Luther King, Jr., told us to
judge people by the content of their
character, not other arbitrary distinc-
tions which may or may not impact on
their performance and their value.
I will continue to fight that ban,
which undermines our national secu-
rity and the military’s effectiveness
and does not reflect the values and
ideals that our military defends.
And if you review the 1948 actions, or
1947 actions of Harry Truman when he
integrated the services and he was told,
‘‘Oh, if you do that, it is going to un-
dermine morale; you ought not to do
that,’’ very frankly, I see this exclu-
sion as very much like that opposition
to that action.
Finally, I will also continue to advo-
cate for a change in policy regarding
Yemen. That war is a human-made dis-
aster. It is not our fault, but we ought
not to be complicit.
In closing, let me say this: This is
$738 billion of hard-earned tax money,
more than anybody in the world
spends. I have been, for the 39 years
that I have been here, a strong sup-
porter of our national security.
I don’t know that, other than when
we had political fights such as the Re-
publicans voting against the defense
bill when it passed the House here, that
I have voted against a defense bill or
an appropriations bill. I am certainly
not going to vote against this one. I am
urging people to support it.
But, Madam Speaker, I want to say
to all of my colleagues that we need,
with great diligence and courage, to
look at the defense budget and look at
that $738 billion with an eye that the
pot is not unlimited and that our na-
tional security depends not only on our
defense investment, but on our domes-
tic investment and education and
healthcare and the welfare of our peo-
ple. I would urge that the committee
focus on how it can effect diligent over-
sight on the expenditure of this ex-
traordinary amount of money, which I
will support.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H10090 December 11, 2019
We included $733 billion. We have no
more security because of that extra $5
billion. And I will tell my friends that
$733 billion was acceptable to some of
the folks I talked to on the Republican
side of the aisle.
So I am supporting this bill, but as I
have urged privately, both the chair-
man and the ranking member, we need
to look very carefully at how we are
expending this amount of money to en-
sure that it is spent effectively and
that we cannot get the same level of
defense at a lower level of expenditure.
That is a tough job to do, but it needs
to be done.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
this bill.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Speaker, may I inquire as to how much
time each side has left.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Washington has 31⁄2 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from
Texas has 91⁄2 minutes remaining.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Speaker, I am prepared to close at this
time. I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker,
I yield myself the balance of my time.
Madam Speaker, Majority Leader
HOYER made two points on which I
want to emphatically agree.
Number one, he said that we are
blessed in this Nation to have the ben-
efit of dedicated staff working on im-
portant legislation such as is before us
today, and their patience has been
tried more than in most years to bring
this bill to this point with what I ex-
pect will be strong bipartisan support.
A tremendous amount of credit goes to
them as well as, as I said before, to
Chairman SMITH, Chairman INHOFE,
and Senator REED.
The second point the majority leader
made is this is a compromise, and he is
exactly right. I can give you a list of
things in the bill that I wish were not
in the bill, and I also have a list of
things that I wish were in the bill that
I tried to get into the bill. So I have
some strong opinions about things I
would do differently. And yet it is not
about me; it is about what this process
can produce.
b 1700
There is no question that what we
have today on the floor is very dif-
ferent from the bill that the House
passed on July 12. It is a very different
bill. Also, the House-passed bill was
very different than the Senate bill,
which they passed something like 86–8.
So bringing those two together has
been a challenge, but it is done.
I will confess, Madam Speaker, that I
feel better that at least some Members
came to the floor to oppose it because
I was beginning to worry that this con-
ference report was not as good or as
important as I thought it was. But I do
feel better that at least some Members
with whom I do not normally agree
have come to oppose it. I am somewhat
relieved on that point.
I am also relieved that the President
has said emphatically that he will sign
this bill, that he strongly supports the
pay raise, the Space Force, the paid pa-
rental leave, and other provisions that
are in this package.
I believe, Madam Speaker, the first
job of the Federal Government is to de-
fend the country. We need to do the
things that are in this bill first before
we look at the other things that all of
us would like to see done. I agree with
the point that as we do this first job of
the Federal Government, we as a body
and certainly the Armed Services Com-
mittee need to carefully oversee this
large amount of funding. That is abso-
lutely part of our responsibility.
I resent, by the way, any implication
that we have not been doing our best to
oversee that funding over the years be-
cause under both parties I believe that
is exactly what we have been doing.
The challenge is we face more risk in
the world than we have ever faced be-
fore in our history with Russia, China,
Iran, North Korea, terrorism, and the
list goes on, new technologies moving
faster than ever.
Just cutting back a little bit on fund-
ing does not ensure that the country
will be protected. As a matter of fact,
this amount of money does not ensure
that the country will be protected. But
it is what we do need to keep working
to do.
By the way, with support of both par-
ties, what we have been trying to do is
see that the taxpayers get more value
for the money we spend and also see
that, when we send a warfighter out on
a mission, he or she is equipped with
the best equipment, the best support,
the best training that this country can
provide because it is wrong to send
them out there on that mission with-
out providing the best that this coun-
try can provide.
Madam Speaker, this is the last point
I want to make. This bill is not about
us, as important as we think we are
sometimes. It is not about our pref-
erences. It is about them. It is about
men and women who risk their lives to
defend us and our freedom. It is about
their families who sacrifice in order
that that service may take place.
Going back to where I started, there
is so much in this bill that is good for
the men and women who serve and
their families. To me, that is the thing
to be most proud of in this bill because
it is about them and what they do for
us. That is the reason I ask all Mem-
bers to support this conference report.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of
my time.
As I said at the opening, this was an
extraordinarily difficult process. It is
worth noting this final conference re-
port also is not anywhere close to what
was passed out of the Senate. In fact,
of the nearly 1,400 provisions that were
adopted, 70 percent of them were House
provisions. The House firmly put its
stamp on this bill in a bipartisan way,
and I think the policies we adopted
were very positive.
We tried to do more in this bill than
has been attempted to do in an NDAA
in the 23 years that I have been here,
and I am proud of that. We didn’t get
everything, but we tried to do every-
thing that we could, that we felt was
important for the national security of
this country and for our interests.
I am particularly disappointed that
we weren’t able to get some of the pro-
visions to help reduce the U.S. influ-
ence on the war in Yemen. I completely
agree with that. My quibble is with the
fact that there was something we could
have done to stop it completely. But
the humanitarian crisis in Yemen is
the greatest humanitarian crisis
around the globe right now. If there is
anything we can do to reduce that, we
need to do it.
I will say that the pressure that was
put on by the House-passed bill that
called for cutting off aid to Saudi Ara-
bia and the UAE, the military aid, has
put some pressure over there. The UAE
has almost unilaterally or almost com-
pletely pulled out of Yemen, and they
recently signed a peace deal with the
southern part of Yemen to resolve
some aspect of that complex civil war.
Make no mistake about it, that is
enormously important to me, and I will
continue to fight to get it done.
Lastly, I want to say this process, I
think, has been incredibly productive.
The amount of work that the staff be-
hind us and more people than I could
possibly count or name did to make
this possible cannot be overstated. It
was an incredible amount of work, and
it is so important.
We are in an incredibly divisive time.
There are people who are upset about
just about everything, sometimes justi-
fied, sometimes not.
Passing legislation in a democracy
when we have to take into account all
of those voices is both extraordinarily
difficult and unbelievably important.
We have to show the world that rep-
resentative democracy works, that we
can listen to the people. You don’t
have to be a dictatorship. You can lis-
ten to a bunch of people and still get a
product done that meets the needs of
the people.
That is what we did in the defense
bill. I will also say it is what we have
done in a couple of other bills. The ag-
riculture and immigration bill that we
will vote on as part of this was another
example of that getting done. We are
now working, knock on wood, to pass
the appropriations bills in that same
spirit.
I hope we don’t lose that spirit. I
hope we don’t realize that just because
when you participate in a representa-
tive democratic process and you don’t
get everything you want, that that
means the process didn’t work. Quite
the opposite. The fact that you have
that voice, the ability to say your
piece and advocate for what you want,
it is essential to freedom, essential to
this country. Frankly, I think it is es-
sential to peace and stability through-
out the globe. We should continue to
advocate for that passionately.

December 11, 2019
I thank all who were involved. This
was a lengthy but important under-
taking. Ultimately, we produced some-
thing that I am very, very proud of. I
don’t want to speak for anybody else. I
know there are probably a lot of people
who are, but just for my part, I am in-
credibly proud of what I was a part of
creating. I think it represents the best
of our country and the best of this
body, and I urge everybody to vote for
it.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I applaud
Chairman SMITH for including in the Fiscal
Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA) Conference Report language to in-
clude the Coast Guard in the Department of
Defense STARBASE Program. The NDAA is
the culmination of many long hours of hard
work, compromise, and showcases the best of
the legislative process. The modified author-
ization of the STARBASE Program included in
this year’s NDAA will help improve science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics
(STEM) education for the youth of America.
Coast Guard support of the STARBASE
Program, which the NDAA now authorizes, will
allow an already successful STEM education
program to be offered in more communities
across our country. Teaching STEM concepts
to elementary and secondary students is more
important than ever to prepare students for
our increasingly complex world that requires
innovation and critical thinking. Introduction of
STEM at an early age allows the best oppor-
tunity for our workforce of the future to gain
skills and expertise needed, to include the pre-
requisites to serve in our Coast Guard, Armed
Forces, and broader federal government.
Additionally, to build on the NDAA provision
that includes the Coast Guard in the
STARBASE Program, I introduced the Coast
Guard Youth STEM Programs Expansion Act
(H.R. 3205). H.R. 3205 ties in the Department
of Education into the STARBASE Program,
improves STEM curriculum, and includes cur-
riculum topics applicable to maritime environ-
ments.
As the FY 2020 NDAA is implemented, I
look forward to ensuring the Coast Guard and
the Department of Defense continue to sup-
port STARBASE and STEM education initia-
tives. I urge support of the NDAA and hope
that in the future, the House will advance the
Coast Guard Youth STEM Programs Expan-
sion Act.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, today I will
vote against the Conference Report to Accom-
pany S. 1790, the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020.
This legislation includes a number of provi-
sions that I strongly support, including giving
servicemen and women a well-deserved raise
of 3.1 percent—the largest pay raise for our
troops since the last Democratic House major-
ity in 2010. Those who serve in uniform have
made extraordinary sacrifices for our country
and have earned and deserve a pay raise.
I am also strongly supportive of the inclu-
sion of twelve weeks of paid parental leave for
federal employees. However, the omission of,
at least, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
and United States Postal Service (USPS) em-
ployees from this coverage is an inexcusable
oversight, and I look forward to working with
House and Senate leaders to enact a legisla-
tive correction.
Moreover, I am pleased that this Con-
ference Report ends the unfair Survivor Ben-
efit Plan (SBP)/Indemnity Compensation (DIC)
offset—also known as the ‘‘widow’s tax’’—
which currently reduces spouse survivor bene-
fits by an average of $1,250 per month. The
families of the men and women serving in the
Armed Forces make significant sacrifices and
deserve the full benefits they have earned
from their spouses’ service.
Unfortunately, this final package is a little
more than a continuation of the status quo,
and it falls well short of the NDAA bill the
House passed earlier this year. The final legis-
lation strips out a number of policy priorities
that were included in the House-passed
NDAA, which I strongly supported, and in-
cludes yet another massive spending increase
to an already bloated Pentagon budget.
I believe this legislation could have made
responsible cuts to our defense budget without
jeopardizing the safety of our troops, pre-
venting a pay increase, or undermining our
national security. For years, Congress has
continued to increase the Pentagon’s budget
despite overwhelming evidence of its waste
and abuse of taxpayer money. This year’s leg-
islation—with its outrageous topline defense
budget of $738 billion—is yet another example
of Congress’s habit of increasing the defense
budget every year. While this administration
has cut SNAP benefits, Medicaid, reproductive
health services, and more, Congress has thus
far boosted the Pentagon’s budget by more
than $130 billion during President Trump’s first
term.
I have long supported a financial audit of
the Pentagon, and for the second year in a
row, the Pentagon has spectacularly failed its
comprehensive audit. While I am pleased the
Pentagon is finally undergoing comprehensive
audits in order to identify waste, it is ridiculous
to provide the Department of Defense (DoD)
another massive spending increase when they
cannot even account for how it spends tax-
payer money.
In particular, I have always opposed the
DoD’s Overseas Contingency Operation
(OCO) account, a fiscally irresponsible fund
that is not counted in the budget, recklessly
adds to our mounting debt, and has no con-
gressional oversight. This Conference Report
allocates $71.5 billion for OCO, a Pentagon
slush fund that gives a blank check to fund
endless wars that Congress hasn’t authorized.
The bottom line is that fiscal responsibility and
accountability at the Pentagon would allow for
funds to be better spent supporting the needs
of our troops, meeting our obligations to vet-
erans, and ensuring our legitimate defense
needs are prioritized.
Beyond bloated Pentagon spending, I am
extremely disappointed that the Conference
Report strips out provisions that would have
prevented the president from using unauthor-
ized force against Iran, prohibited U.S. support
for and participation in the Saudi-led coalition’s
military operations in Yemen, and repealed the
long-outdated 2002 authorization for the use
of military force (AUMF) in Iraq. These provi-
sions passed with bipartisan support in the
House, and failure to include them is yet an-
other abdication of Congress’s constitutional
war powers. I have always advocated for re-
affirming Congress’s constitutional authority to
declare war and limiting the president’s au-
thority to engage in armed conflict without the
consent of Congress and will continue to do
so.
While I am pleased that this legislation
blocks any backfill for DoD funds raided by
President Trump for his unnecessary, ineffec-
tive border wall, it fails to include House-
passed language that prevented the president
from diverting additional funding under his so-
called national emergency declaration. Under
this emergency declaration, President Trump
has taken more than $3.6 billion from the
DoD’s high-priority military construction
projects, $2.5 billion from the DoD’s drug inter-
diction program, and has transferred funds
from other critical, lifesaving agencies under
the Department of Homeland Security, the
U.S. Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), the Transpor-
tation Security Administration (TSA), and
more. As Chairman of the Transportation & In-
frastructure Committee, I twice led the debate
on the House floor to terminate this emer-
gency declaration. Despite the fact that Con-
gress has voted multiple times, with strong bi-
partisan support, to terminate this declaration,
President Trump has repeatedly vetoed. I will
continue to fight to bring an end to this na-
tional emergency declaration.
Additionally, the House unanimously adopt-
ed an amendment to the NDAA that would
have required the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) to regulate PFAS as a haz-
ardous substance under our nation’s Super-
fund law, as well as restrict future discharges
from manufacturers into drinking water under
the Clean Water Act. PFAS are dangerous
carcinogens that are virtually ubiquitous in
American’s drinking water, and Congress must
restrict their use and clean up our water
sources that are contaminated.
Unfortunately, Senate Republicans refused
time and time again to negotiate any com-
promise on these important provisions, and
the language was removed from the Con-
ference Report. Fortunately, Majority Leader
HOYER has already stated that he will bring
the PFAS Action Act to the House floor in Jan-
uary, and I look forward to voting for that leg-
islation.
Lastly, this Conference Report strips out a
House-passed prohibition on sending new de-
tainees to Guantanamo Bay, doing almost
nothing to hasten the closing of this detention
facility. This facility, which costs almost $450
million each year to house 40 prisoners, has
been a black eye for the United States, erod-
ing relationships with our allies, bolstering ter-
rorist recruitment tools, undermining U.S. mis-
sions abroad, and putting U.S. citizens and
our troops at risk of retaliation.
Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to speak on Section 1011 in the NDAA
conference report relating to contracting sub-
missions about disciplinary proceedings involv-
ing audit personnel to be made to the Depart-
ment of Defense will be afforded confidentiality
and other protections otherwise due under ex-
isting law, including those that Congress has
separately accorded such proceedings. As a
result of Section 1011, Section 1006 from the
FY 2019 NDAA submissions must be treated
in a manner ‘‘consistent with any protections
or privileges established by any other provi-
sion of federal law.’’ Section 1011 in this
year’s NDAA requires Section 1006 from the
FY 2019 NDAA to henceforth require disclo-
sure of the existence of a PCAOB proceeding
against relevant personnel doing important
DoD audit work, and in a manner that is com-
pliant with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H10092 December 11, 2019
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
support of the Fiscal Year 2020 National De-
fense Authorization Act (NDAA) which reflects
the hard work of the House Armed Services
Committee to craft legislation that ensures that
the military has the resources needed to de-
fend our nation. I was particularly pleased that
the legislation included a pay increase for
servicemembers, repeal of the Survivor Ben-
efit Plan/Indemnity Compensation Offset to
provide Gold Star Families with their full,
earned benefits, and changes to allow access
to justice for military members and their fami-
lies harmed by medical malpractice.
I want to take a moment to clarify the intent
behind Section 1101 of the legislation. Like my
colleagues on the Committee, I feel strongly
that the finances of the Department of De-
fense must be subject to meaningful audit and
oversight. It is clear to me that requiring ac-
counting firms supporting this critical mission
to disclose ongoing disciplinary proceedings,
including Public Company Accounting Over-
sight Board (PCAOB) proceedings, to the De-
partment of Defense is a backdoor attempt to
begin intruding on a process that Congress
determined as part of Sarbanes-Oxley and
should remain confidential. Section 1011 of
the NDAA makes clear that these disclosures
should not impinge on the confidentiality of
PCAOB proceedings governed by Sarbanes-
Oxley. The best way to reconcile these two
statutes, which I believe has been done, is to
require accounting firms to disclose the exist-
ence of a proceeding to the Department when
those proceedings are relevant to the impor-
tant work of the Department and such a dis-
closure is consistent with the requirements of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
I urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting this important legislation.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise
in support of the Conference Report to S.
1790, the ‘‘National Defense Authorization Act
for Fiscal Year 2020.’’
The National Defense Authorization Act is
designed to meet the threats we face today as
well as into the future.
The results of our work here today will re-
flect our strong commitment to ensure that the
men and women of our Armed Services re-
ceive the benefits and support that they de-
serve for their faithful service.
Building on our efforts from previous years,
this bill contains a number of initiatives de-
signed to provide the resources and support
needed for the men and women who keep our
nation safe.
This legislation recognizes the reality that
we live in a dangerous world, where threats
are not always easily identifiable, and our en-
emies are not bound by borders.
Confronting this unique type of enemy re-
quires unique capabilities.
As we have seen time and time again, our
military has the ability to track down violent
extremists who wish to do our country harm,
regardless of where they reside.
Madam Speaker, I am pleased that seven of
my amendments adopted during House con-
sideration of the NDAA are included in the
final legislation or in language in the accom-
panying report:
Jackson Lee Amendment directing the Sec-
retary of Defense to promulgate regulations to
ensure that candidates granted admission to
attend a military academy undergo screening
for speech disorders and be provided the re-
sults of the screening test and a list of warfare
unrestricted line (URL) Officer positions and
occupation specialists that require successful
performance on the speech test. Academy
students shall have the option of undergoing
speech therapy to reduce speech disorders or
impediments.
Jackson Lee Amendment directing the Sec-
retary of Defense to submit a report analyzing
the capacity of the Department of Defense to
provide survivors of natural disasters with
emergency short-term housing to the congres-
sional defense committees not later than 220
days after the date of enactment of this Act.
Jackson Lee Amendment directing the Sec-
retary of Defense to provide a briefing to up-
date the Committees on Armed Services of
the Senate and the House no later than March
15, 2019 on the status of the program re-
quired in section 1277 of the John S. McCain
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2018, including an assessment of wheth-
er the program is beneficial to students intern-
ing, working part time, or in a program that will
result in post-graduation employment with the
Department of Defense components or con-
tractors.
Jackson Lee Amendment requiring report on
Maternity Mortality Rates for military members
and their dependents.
Jackson Lee Amendment requiring report to
be submitted to Congress within 240 days fol-
lowing enactment on the risks posed by debris
in low earth orbit and to make recommenda-
tions on remediation of risks and outline plans
to reduce the incident of space debris.
Jackson Lee Amendment requiring that a
report from the Secretary of Defense 240 days
after the date of the enactment to the congres-
sional defense committees that accounts for
all of the efforts, programs, initiatives, and in-
vestments of the Department of Defense to
train elementary, secondary, and postsec-
ondary students in fields related to
cybersecurity, cyber defense, and cyber oper-
ations.
Jackson Lee Amendment adding ‘‘instruc-
tion on the opportunities and risks posed by
advancements in AI’’ to the objectives of the
Artificial Intelligence Education Strategy.
The passing of this bill today brings us one
step closer to enacting the 57th consecutive
National Defense Authorization Act.
Despite disagreements on key issues, Mem-
bers have not failed to reach consensus on
behalf of our fighting men and women.
I am proud of the work we have done here
today.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time
for debate has expired.
Pursuant to House Resolution 758,
the previous question is ordered.
The question is on adoption of the
conference report.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker,

f
FARM WORKFORCE
MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2019
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further
consideration of the bill (H.R. 5038) to
amend the Immigration and Nation-
ality Act to provide for terms and con-
ditions for nonimmigrant workers per-
forming agricultural labor or services,
and for other purposes, will now re-
sume.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
MOTION TO RECOMMIT
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I have a
motion to recommit at the desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentleman opposed to the bill?
Mr. BIGGS. I am in its current form.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.
The Clerk read as follows:
Mr. Biggs moves to recommit the bill H.R.
5038 to the Committee on the Judiciary with
instructions to report the same back to the
House forthwith with the following amend-
ment:
Page 112, strike line 10 and all that follows
through page 115, line 11 (and redesignate
provisions accordingly).
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Ar-
izona is recognized for 5 minutes in
support of his motion.
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, in its
current form, H.R. 5038 would subject
growers to a new private right of ac-
tion in Federal court. As a result, these
employers would face countless frivo-
lous lawsuits and higher costs in the
form of damages and other litigation
costs.
The bottom line is that many Amer-
ican farmers and other agricultural
employers would be sued right out of
business. This provision is one of the
main reasons that, arguably, the big-
gest agricultural group in the world,
the American Farm Bureau, does not
support this bill.
Our motion to recommit would sim-
ply strike sections 204(a) and (b) of the
bill. This motion to recommit is sup-
ported by the American Farm Bureau,
and I ask all Members to support it as
well.
As a technical matter, Madam
Speaker, we seek to recommit this bill
to the Judiciary Committee. And that
is interesting to me, and I think it
should be of interest to all of us here
because, in just a few hours, that com-
mittee is going to meet on a com-
pletely bogus Articles of Impeachment,
where we will consider that there.
Over a week ago, every Republican
member of the Judiciary Committee
signed a letter to request a minority
day hearing.
We are going to have the markup in
2 hours, and we haven’t had the minor-
ity hearing yet, with no intention, I
guess, of allowing the minority its
rights under the rules.
Specifically, clause(2)(j)(1) of House
rule XI states: ‘‘Whenever a hearing is
conducted by a committee on a meas-
ure or matter, the minority members
of the committee shall be entitled,
upon request to the chairman by a ma-
jority of them before the completion of
the hearing, to call witnesses selected
by the minority to testify with respect
to that measure or matter during at
least one day of hearing thereon.’’
And here we sit. We sit, and we are
going to be going in, in 2 hours or so.
We are going to have our opening
statements, and then we will proceed
to vote on the Articles of Impeachment
offered by our friends on the other side
of the aisle.
To what end? It is this obviation of
the rule that is consistent with how we
have seen this whole process play out.
We have written the chair of the
Rules Committee to remind all chairs
of their obligation to adhere to the
rules of the House. Unfortunately, the
hearing is yet to be scheduled.
I would suggest that the Democratic
case for impeachment is not nearly so
strong as they would have us believe.
Otherwise, they would be affording us a
simple minority hearing day.
When one considers it, and I wish ev-
eryone would consider it, we are being
afforded more procedural rights on this
bill, which is dead on arrival in the
Senate, than we are in the impeach-
ment proceeding of the President of the
United States. That is simply wrong,
Madam Speaker.
One day, I suggest, we will be beyond
this mania, this hysteria that has set
in here, and the other shoe will drop. I
know that many in this body do not
care for this President, and I under-
stand that. But I think we all should
have respect for this institution, and
we should take care of this institution.
We should respect the due process
rights of the minority. That is all we
are asking. We want that minority
hearing day.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. BRINDISI. Madam Speaker, I
claim the time in opposition.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York is recognized
for 5 minutes.
Mr. BRINDISI. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in opposition to this motion
to recommit and in strong support of
this underlying legislation.
Madam Speaker, America’s farmers,
producers, and ranchers provide the
American people with the safest, most
abundant, and most affordable food
supply in the world.
Their job is challenging enough, but
for too long, our broken immigration
system has made this job even more
difficult. I have heard from farmers
across upstate New York and across
the country, sharing the urgent need
for responsible, commonsense action to
address the labor shortage on Amer-
ican farms and ranches.
In fact, every time I visit a farm in
my community, immigration is one of
the top issues I hear about from farm-
ers. A shortage of workers has led to
crops rotting in the fields, billions of
dollars in lost productivity, and farm-
ers shuttering their operations.
For too long, the broken politics in
Washington have made it impossible to
make progress on bipartisan immigra-
tion reform. But thanks to the tireless
work of Congresswoman LOFGREN and
Congressman NEWHOUSE, and the en-
gagement of dozens of Members and
hundreds of agricultural and labor
stakeholders, we have a solid, bipar-
tisan bill that finally moves the ball
forward.
The Farm Workforce Modernization
Act is something people don’t think
happens much in Congress anymore, a
bipartisan answer to a serious chal-
lenge. Republicans and Democrats
came together, worked with each
other, and found a solution that both
sides can live with and that delivers re-
sults for American agriculture and
workers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H10094 December 11, 2019
Our legislation will expand the H–2A
visa program to year-round operations
like dairy farms, streamline the pro-
gram to make it easier for farmers to
use, and strengthen the electronic veri-
fication process to ensure a legal work-
force.
It also includes a tough but fair legal
status for the existing farm workforce,
allowing agricultural workers to get
right with the law. The bill also in-
cludes strong criminal bars, preventing
anyone with a felony conviction or two
misdemeanors from obtaining legal
status.
Both sides negotiated in good faith,
and in the end, we have a strong, bipar-
tisan bill on the floor to support.
Working together with Democrats
and Republicans shows that Congress
can get things done for our farmers.
That includes farmers like Mike, who
owns a dairy operation in my district
in Homer, New York.
Mike testified in front of the Agri-
culture Committee earlier this year
and told us in no uncertain terms: ‘‘Ag-
riculture needs a way to secure a work-
force that is steady, willing, able, and
legal. We need to bring the multitude
of indispensable agricultural workers
who are already here out of the shad-
ows without major disruption to the
workforce.’’
Mike is supporting this bill, and the
bill has earned the strong support of
more than 300 agriculture groups from
across the country, the Chamber of
Commerce, faith groups, labor groups,
and many others.
To my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle, I would say that we have a real
chance here to deliver a compromise—
let me say that word again, ‘‘com-
promise’’—that will make our country
stronger and help grow American agri-
culture.
President Ronald Reagan, the last
President to sign an agriculture labor
bill into law, once said: ‘‘I’ve always
thought that when we Americans get
up in the morning, when we see bacon,
eggs, toast, and milk on our breakfast
table, we should give thanks that our
farmers are survivors. You are the real
miracle workers of the modern world—
keepers of an incredible system based
on faith, freedom, hard work, produc-
tivity, and profit—a system that feeds
us and sustains millions of the world’s
hungry.’’
Let’s get the job done. Let’s deliver a
win for our American farmers. Let’s
oppose this amendment and get this
bill passed.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit.
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion to recommit.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that

LOWER DRUG COSTS NOW ACT OF
2019
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material
on H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings
Lower Drug Costs Now Act.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey?
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 758 and rule
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in
the Committee of the Whole House on
the state of the Union for the consider-
ation of the bill, H.R. 3.
The Chair appoints the gentleman
from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE) to pre-
side over the Committee of the Whole.
b 1818
IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
consideration of the bill (H.R. 3) to es-
tablish a fair price negotiation pro-
gram, protect the Medicare program
from excessive price increases, and es-
tablish an out-of-pocket maximum for
Medicare part D enrollees, and for
other purposes, with Mr. PAYNE in the
chair.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the
bill is considered read the first time.
General debate shall not exceed 4
hours, with 3 hours equally divided
among and controlled by the respective
chairs and ranking minority members
of the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce, Committee on Ways and Means,
and Committee on Education and
Labor, and 1 hour equally divided and
controlled by the majority leader and
the minority leader or their respective
designees.
The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.
PALLONE), the gentleman from Oregon
(Mr. WALDEN), the gentleman from
Massachusetts, (Mr. NEAL), the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY), the
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT),
and the gentlewoman from North Caro-
lina (Ms. FOXX), the majority leader or
a designee, and the minority leader or
a designee each will control 30 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE).
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, this week, we will fulfill a
promise we made to the American peo-
ple to make prescription drugs more af-
fordable. No American should be forced
into choosing between putting food on
the table for their family and taking a
lifesaving drug, but, all too often, that
is exactly what is happening.
The American people are getting
ripped off because drug companies have
a monopoly on their drugs until
generics come to market. They can
charge Americans whatever they want,
and they do.
H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings
Lower Drug Costs Now Act, finally
gives the Federal Government the
power to negotiate lower prescription
drug prices for the American people.
Other developed countries negotiate
with the pharmaceutical companies,
and prices in those countries are four
or five or ten times less for the exact
same drugs. This simply isn’t fair, and
the American people are rightfully fed
up.
It is time that we finally level the
playing field and empower the Federal
Government to negotiate a better deal.
These negotiations will not only lead
to lower prices for consumers, it will
also result in significant savings to the
Federal Government. H.R. 3 takes the
resulting $500 billion in savings and re-
invests it in the American healthcare
system and the search for new cures.
We cap out-of-pocket costs for sen-
iors in the Medicare Part D program
for the first time, giving seniors the
peace of mind of knowing that their
drug cost will not bankrupt them or
empty their retirement accounts.
We make transformational invest-
ments in the Medicare program—add-
ing for the first time benefits for den-
tal, hearing, and vision coverage. These
new benefits are going to make a huge
difference in the lives of our Nation’s
seniors.
We invest $12 billion in the search for
new cures and treatments by boosting
funding for the National Institutes of
Health and the Food and Drug Admin-
istration. NIH, as we know, plays a
critical role in the research and devel-
opment of new drugs, and this invest-
ment will ensure that these cures and
treatments become a reality. We also
invest in combatting the opioid crisis,
community health centers, and mater-
nal healthcare. And finally, beyond the
negotiation, we are holding pharma-
ceutical companies accountable for
when they jack up prices, bringing
much-needed transparency to the proc-
ess.
Mr. Chairman, the status quo is sim-
ply unacceptable and unsustainable. It
is time to negotiate a better deal for
the American people. It is time to pass
H.R. 3.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, let me be clear: Drug costs
in America are too high. Republicans
believe this, and so do Democrats. We
all should work together, though, to
lower drug costs for consumers. We all

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10097

should work together to stop anti-
competitive actions of pharmaceutical
companies that try to game the system
and delay access to lower cost alter-
native medicines. And we should all
work together—together, Mr. Chair—to
pass legislation that both lowers drug
costs, without killing off medical inno-
vation.
Unfortunately, H.R. 3 fails on this
count. And that is not just my conclu-
sion, Mr. Chair. The great American
innovators who are working day and
night to find cures to Alzheimer’s, to
cancer, to ALS, to Parkinson’s, and the
hundreds of other diseases and life-
changing therapies are pleading with
us for a ‘‘no’’ vote to H.R. 3—the Demo-
crats’ plan.
Mr. Chair, 138 different biotech com-
panies signed a letter to Congress 5
days ago. After reading the bill, they
wrote: ‘‘This extreme proposal will
upend the ecosystem of U.S. bio-
medical innovation, destroying our
ability to attract private sector invest-
ment.’’
These are the companies who develop
the new innovations in medicine. They
said H.R. 3 will shatter the dreams of
patients hoping for lifesaving cures.
Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD
the letter in support from those compa-
nies.
DECEMBER 5, 2019.
Hon. NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker of the House,
Washington, DC.
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY,
House Republican Leader,
Washington, DC.
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND REPUBLICAN
LEADER MCCARTHY: We represent the com-
munity of emerging biotechnology compa-
nies whose researchers and scientists strive
daily to develop innovative life-changing
therapies and cures for patients. We take
pride that we are providing hope to patients
and their families and changing the world
through medical breakthroughs. These
dreams will be shattered if H.R. 3, the Lower
Drug Costs Now Act, if passed.
We are at an incredible inflection point in
science and technology that is bringing forth
transformative treatments and even cures
for cancer, infectious diseases, and a myriad
of other serious and rare diseases. These ad-
vancements are benefiting lives of millions
of patients and alleviating human suffering,
while helping to reduce other more expensive
parts of our health care system, such as hos-
pital spending. Our continued success de-
pends on maintaining an environment that
supports investment in tomorrow’s discov-
eries.
Unfortunately, H.R. 3 is an unprecedented
and aggressive government intervention in
the U.S. market of drug development and de-
livery that will limit patient access to these
extraordinary advancements in health care.
This extreme proposal will upend the eco-
system of U.S. biomedical innovation, de-
stroying our ability to attract private in-
vestment dollars that allow us to develop
new treatments and change the course of
healthcare delivery for so many patients.
We strongly urge you to abandon H.R. 3.
Further, in order to keep pace with this bio-
medical revolution and ensure America re-
mains the world leader in innovation, we
hope that you will pursue bipartisan, holistic
policies that modernize our health care pay-
ment system and lower drug costs for pa-
tients.

Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, the Con-
gressional Budget Office, they also
looked at H.R. 3, Speaker PELOSI’s bill,
and they said it would kill off more
than 38 new medical innovations—38.
The Council of Economic Advisers,
they looked at it and said they thought
it would be more like 100 new medi-
cines that would be lost. It is no won-
der that President Trump, the coun-
try’s strongest advocate for lowering
drug prices, said even he could not sup-
port H.R. 3, and would have to veto it.
Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD
the Statement of Administration Pol-
icy.
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
H.R. 3—THE ELIJAH E. CUMMINGS LOWER DRUG
COSTS NOW ACT—REP. PALLONE, D–NJ, AND 106
COSPONSORS
The Administration opposes passage of
H.R. 3, which contains several provisions
that would harm seniors and all who need
lifesaving medicines. Nevertheless, as Con-
gress follows the President’s lead on reduc-
ing prescription drug costs, the Administra-
tion welcomes bipartisan efforts to enact
legislation that provides additional prescrip-
tion drug-cost relief for American families.
In its current form, H.R. 3 would likely un-
dermine access to lifesaving medicines. The
bill creates a statutory scheme for ‘‘negotia-
tion’’ between the Secretary of Health and
Human Services and pharmaceutical manu-
facturers regarding the price of prescription
drugs, but the penalty for failing to reach
agreement with the Secretary is so large
that the Secretary could effectively impose
price controls on manufacturers. Moreover,
this price-fixing mechanism places price con-
trols on drugs available under Medicare and
commercial plans, and imposes devastating
fines on manufacturers, raising serious con-
cerns under the Fifth Amendment’s Takings
Clause and Eighth Amendment’s Excessive
Fines Clause.
This bill would also compromise the health
of Americans by dramatically reducing the
incentive to bring innovative therapeutics to
market. The preliminary Congressional
Budget Office (CBO) analysis indicates that
the bill would reduce the number of new
medicines coming to market. The Council of
Economic Advisers (CEA) finds that H.R. 3’s
price controls would affect as much as one
third of drugs under development, meaning
that out of 300 projected new medicines that
would otherwise be approved over 10 years by
the Food and Drug Administration, 100 could
be severely delayed or never developed. As a
result, CEA estimates H.R. 3 would erase a
quarter of the expected gains in life expect-
ancy in the United States over the next dec-
ade.
The preliminary CBO analysis of H.R. 3
does not account for the additional costs
that would burden families and the Federal
Government due to the unavailability of life-
saving and cost-reducing medicine that
would otherwise exist. For example, an Alz-
heimer’s cure, or new treatments for site
specific cancers or diabetes, may be delayed
or never developed under the regime imposed
by H.R. 3. Thus, the cost of caring for a
growing and aging population with direct
care, skilled nursing, and home health could
be substantially greater than the drug-cost
savings estimated by CBO. More impor-
tantly, the effects of these cost increases on
individuals and their families will be signifi-
cant, personal, and long-lasting.
This legislation does include important
policies championed by the Trump Adminis-
tration to lower prescription drug costs.
These include establishing a cap on out-of-
pocket expenses for all beneficiaries in Medi-
care Part D and simplifying and improving
that program. H.R. 3 also would limit annual
price increases of certain drugs in Medicare
to the rate of inflation, protecting bene-
ficiaries and taxpayers from excessive price
hikes. These provisions reflect the Adminis-
tration’s priorities, although modifications
should be made to strike a better balance in
protecting beneficiaries, taxpayers, and in-
novation.
The Administration strongly prefers the
Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of
2019, which was reported out of the Senate
Finance Committee on a bipartisan basis.
This legislation offers a sound approach to
delivering relief to seniors from high pre-
scription drug costs while safeguarding the
ongoing development of life-saving and sus-
taining medicines.
Additionally, H.R. 19, the Lower Costs,
More Cures Act, shares many of the same bi-
partisan elements of the Prescription Drug
Pricing Reduction Act and is also a far bet-
ter approach to lowering drug prices and dis-
covering life-saving cures than H.R. 3.
The President believes there is a path for-
ward to enacting bipartisan legislation that
lowers prescription drug costs for American
families. The Administration remains com-
mitted to working with both parties to pass
legislation that will lower drug costs while
encouraging innovation in the development
of lifesaving medicines.
If H.R. 3 were presented to the President in
its current form, he would veto the bill.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, my friends
on the other side, the Democrats, ig-
nore these facts. Some have even said—
can you imagine this—that it is ‘‘worth
it’’ to forego cures.
Seriously? That it is worth it to
never have a cure for Alzheimer’s?
Is it worth it to never have a cure for
ALS?
What about Huntington’s Disease, or
Parkinson’s, or rheumatoid arthritis?
The answer for me is ‘‘no,’’ because one
lost cure is one too many.
The Independent Congressional Re-
search Service also read through H.R.
3. They said it is unconstitutional,
most likely because of the huge and pu-
nitive club that it hands the govern-
ment. You see, if an innovator, under
the bill on the floor today that the
Democrats have, if an innovator does
not agree with the price that the gov-
ernment demands, then the govern-
ment can take 95 percent of that com-
pany’s revenues for the sale of that
drug—95 percent.
Oh, by the way, it is actually higher
than that because you can’t deduct it
and they have to pay tax. Democrats
call that a negotiation. I call that a
mugging, Mr. Chair, a mugging.
Their scheme is based on what hap-
pens with drugs in six other countries.
And they ignore that in these ref-
erenced countries and other countries
around the world, people are actually
denied access to lifesaving medicines
that Americans have access to. So this
is the tradeoff here.
If you remember nothing else, it is
that we first get access to medicines,
and in the countries the bill would
emulate and copy and bring the process
here, you don’t get access to some of
these lifesaving drugs that Americans
do here. That is your trade.
Let me tell you about the family of
Katie Stafford:
She is a child living with cystic fibro-
sis in the United Kingdom. She was
told by officials she cannot receive the
medicine that her doctor determined
would be the best chance at treating
her life-threatening condition, because
they don’t cover it in the United King-
dom under their system.
Let me tell you about Andre and
Joshua: They are Canadian brothers,
tragically both suffering from cystic fi-
brosis. Their parents had to beg the Ca-
nadian Government to cover treatment
for their sons as they slowly lose their
lung function. Now, their oldest son is
enrolled in a clinical trial that the
youngest son is ineligible for. So they
must watch as one child gets help and
the other child’s health declines.
Fortunately, Mr. Chair, American
children have access to this new medi-
cine. We cannot allow this to happen in
the United States. Denial of care is not
an American value.
But I want to be clear: We all agree
that Americans do pay too much for
prescription drugs, and we need to
come back together as Republicans and
Democrats to help solve this issue.
There is a better way, because we can
reduce the cost of drugs. We can im-
prove healthcare, and we can lower
long-term costs, but we don’t have to
do it at the expense of great American
innovation while restricting patient’s
access to lifesaving medicines.
There is a way to do this. In fact,
Members will have an opportunity to
support, really, the only bipartisan leg-
islation to come to the floor, H.R. 19.
You will see it as a substitute, the
Lower Costs, More Cures Act, which we
will offer as a substitute amendment,
is the bipartisan solution. It can be
signed into law this year—this year—
not vetoed, not never gain attention in
the Senate like H.R. 3 will find itself, if
it gets there, but this can become law.
This is where we can join together
and immediately begin to provide relief
to patients and seniors from high pre-
scription drug costs. This bill lowers
out-of-pocket spending, protects access
to new medicines and cures, strength-
ens transparency and accountability,
and champions competition and inno-
vation. And most importantly, every
single proposal, Mr. Chair, every single
proposal in H.R. 19, the substitute, is
bipartisan work—Democrats and Re-
publicans. We give you this option.
b 1830
This is a serious proposal. It has been
described that way. It could be signed,
would be signed into law by the Presi-
dent by the end of this year. So let’s
not force a partisan plan that, frankly,
puts politics over progress, that kills
medical innovation and cures.
Instead, can’t we come together and
pass meaningful bipartisan legislation,

get it across the finish line and actu-
ally find lower costs and more cures for
Americans?
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from South
Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN), our majority
whip.
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Chair, I thank
the gentleman for yielding me the
time.
Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of
H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower
Drug Costs Now Act.
Martin Luther King, Jr., once said:
‘‘Of all the forms of inequality, injus-
tice in healthcare is the most shocking
and inhumane.’’ I believe my dear
friend, Elijah Cummings, would agree
that H.R. 3 is a giant step toward ad-
dressing injustice in healthcare.
This landmark legislation gives
Medicare the power to negotiate di-
rectly with drug companies and ex-
tends those negotiated prices to Ameri-
cans with private insurance, also. This
is a huge win for the American con-
sumer.
In the United States, our drug prices
are nearly four times higher than in
similar countries. This legislation pro-
vides real price reductions that would
put significant money back in con-
sumers’ pockets. A portion of those
savings will be reinvested in research-
ing new cures and treatments.
These cost savings will also extend
Medicare benefits to cover dental, vi-
sion, and hearing, and caps out-of-
pocket prescription drug costs at $2,000
for those on Medicare.
In addition, these savings will allow
$10 billion to fund provisions that are
in my community health center’s legis-
lation to enhance those facilities that
serve 28 million Americans, half of
which are in rural communities.
The bill includes a $5 billion funding
boost for capital improvements and
construction to expand the footprint of
community health centers, and an ad-
ditional $5 billion in funding over 5
years for community health center
grants.
Providing consistent funding for and
building on the success of community
health centers is critically important
to making quality healthcare more ac-
cessible and affordable.
In my district, where four rural hos-
pitals recently closed, there are eight
federally funded community health
centers working to serve almost 190,000
patients.
Mr. Chair, I urge strong bipartisan
support for H.R. 3, a piece of legislation
that will contribute to the ending of
injustice in healthcare and help move
us closer to making the greatness of
America accessible and affordable for
all.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Ohio
(Mr. LATTA).
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Chair, I rise today,
agreeing with Americans that drug
prices are too high. Congress must act,
and we have done so in the Energy and
Commerce Committee by passing bi-
partisan solutions.
H.R. 3 is bad policy, a partisan sham,
and will result in more than 100 fewer
cures. Plus, it is dead on arrival in the
Senate.
What if that one new drug is the cure
for Alzheimer’s or cancer?
Under the leadership of Ranking
Member WALDEN, we have solutions
that deliver lower costs and more cures
to Americans. Our bill is entirely bi-
partisan.
H.R. 19 lowers the costs of prescrip-
tion drugs and caps seniors’ out-of-
pocket costs. It encourages innovation
and will increase competition, while
enhancing transparency and getting
more generic medicines to market fast-
er.
The American people deserve solu-
tions that will be signed into law. I en-
courage my colleagues across the aisle
to deliver the American people more
cures, not fewer, and to support H.R.
19.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. ESHOO), who is the
chairwoman of our Subcommittee on
Health.
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chair, I rise in sup-
port of the Elijah E. Cummings Lower
Drug Costs Now Act.
This is in your name, Elijah, and I
think that you are listening.
This bill is the most trans-
formational change to Medicare since
President Johnson signed Medicare
into law in 1965. Why? Because it al-
lows Medicare to directly negotiate the
price of the most expensive drugs in
our country, including insulin. The
lower price will not only apply to sen-
iors who are enrolled in Medicare, but
across all private insurance policies.
Manufacturers will no longer be able
to hike prices faster than the rate of
inflation. And, very importantly, it
caps the out-of-pocket cost to seniors
for their prescriptions at $2,000 a year.
That is going to be a godsend to sen-
iors.
Something else that will be a god-
send to seniors is, with the savings in
this legislation, seniors in Medicare
will have additional benefits that they
have been clamoring for for a very long
time: coverage for vision, dental, and
hearing, as well as colonoscopies and
lymphedema treatment.
Very importantly—very impor-
tantly—I hear a lot about innovation
here. This legislation increases funds
for the National Institutes of Health to
research and develop new cures. It pro-
vides almost $3 billion for the FDA to
ensure the safety of our drugs—very
important that all the committee
members know that.
It invests in our community health
centers, and it directs $10 billion to ad-
dress the opioid crisis in our country.
So what is the difference between
what the Republicans are saying and
what the Democrats are saying? At the
core of this bill, H.R. 3, is that there
will be direct negotiations with the
drug manufacturers to bring the price
of drugs down. Our Republican friends
do not support that.
And we know it works, direct nego-
tiations in the VA, direct negotiations
in TRICARE, which is the healthcare
system for all of our fellow Americans
that wear a uniform and their families.
So this legislation is sensible. Mil-
lions of Americans are not only going
to save money, they will finally, fi-
nally, finally have the peace of mind
that they will be able to afford the pre-
scription drugs that they need for
treatment, or those treatments that
keep them alive.
I am so proud of the work that the
committee has done, and I recommend
this bill to every single Member of the
House—Republicans, Democrats—be-
cause of the substance of it and what it
will bring into people’s lives.

clude a list of the drugs not covered by

Mr. WALDEN. Mr Chairman, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from North
Carolina (Mr. HUDSON).
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, Repub-
licans and Democrats agree: Americans
pay too much for prescription drugs.
We agree we need to do something
about it. We agree our friends and
loved ones need access to lifesaving
cures and treatments.
Americans want us to work together
in a bipartisan way to get things done;
yet, today, we are considering Speaker
PELOSI’s partisan bill. This is an exer-
cise in futility. Not only will it stop an
estimated 100 new lifesaving drugs, it
has no chance of being signed into law.
I care about the millions of Ameri-
cans, like my late grandmother, living
with Alzheimer’s and the thousands of
Americans diagnosed with cancer every
single day and the children who face
life-altering diagnoses, like spinal mus-
cular atrophy, epilepsy, or cystic fibro-
sis. I want them to have hope, and I
want them to have access to the very
best medicine. That is why we intro-
duced H.R. 19, bipartisan legislation
that could be signed into law by Presi-
dent Trump this year.
So let’s stop the partisan theatrics
and get serious about the problem that
people are begging us to fix.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Il-
linois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY).
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman,
since 2003, the pharmaceutical compa-
nies have had free rein to gouge sick
people. They forced into law language
that prohibited the Federal Govern-
ment from negotiating with the drug
companies for lower prices, which al-
ready the Veterans Administration
does and has done for decades.
We know that negotiating for fair
prices actually is the only way that we
are going to be able to lower prices,
and that is what H.R. 3 is going to do.
Even Donald Trump has said that,
when he was a candidate: When it
comes to negotiating the cost of drugs,
we are going to negotiate like crazy.
That was then, and this is now.
The Congressional Budget Office says
we are going to save about half a tril-
lion dollars when we negotiate in the
most effective way to protect seniors
and families and anyone who has insur-
ance, and we are going to be able to use
that money to finally help senior citi-
zens who need help with their eye-
glasses, with their hearing aids, with
their dental care. We are going to be
able to make such a difference in their
lives.
Ninety percent of Democrats, 87 per-
cent of Independents, and 80 percent of
Republicans say they support allowing
the Federal Government to negotiate
for prices. The time is absolutely now
for us to pass this legislation.
H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings
Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019, is
the solution that we have been waiting
for, a historic step forward in our fight
to solve the problem of the prescription
drug pricing crisis that we face in this
country.
I look forward to seeing it pass into
law and the President of the United
States keeping his promise and not
breaking it by signing negotiation into
law.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. SHIMKUS), an incredible, im-
portant member of our committee.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, do you
want 10 new drugs, 30 new drugs on the
market, 100 new drugs on the market
or zero? H.R. 3 removes research and
development investments, which will
hinder innovation.
Innovation doesn’t always mean
higher cost. Take hepatitis C, which
lowers, reduces healthcare costs in the
long run.
Technology and innovation have al-
ways had the potential to reduce the
time and costs of identifying and devel-
oping new therapies, which lower the
cost of drugs.
Incorporation of innovative genomic
analysis means drug developers can re-
duce the amount of guesswork in iden-
tifying candidate molecules for further
research.
This same technology is being used
by drug manufacturers today to help
streamline and expedite the process of
conducting trials.
And investments in precision medi-
cine will mean that you don’t prescribe
drugs that will not work or, in some
cases, make people sicker.
That is why I support H.R. 19, the
Lower Costs, More Cures Act, which is
composed entirely of bipartisan provi-
sions and could become law right now.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. MATSUI), a member of
our Energy and Commerce Committee.
b 1845
Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
I rise today in support of H.R. 3, the
Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs
Now Act, the most transformational
expansion of Medicare since its cre-
ation.
As co-chair of the House Democrats’
Task Force on Aging and Families, I
am fighting for the nearly 9 in 10 sen-
iors taking a prescription drug, be-
cause when our system puts profit over
patient health, beneficiaries pay the
price.
With this landmark legislation, we
are delivering on the promise to lift up
older Americans and their families.
H.R. 3 negotiates lower drug prices. It
expands Medicare to include vision,
dental, and hearing coverage. It caps
out-of-pocket costs, and we extend low
drug prices to all Americans with pri-
vate plans.
While there are many reasons to sup-
port H.R. 3, mine is Tony from Sac-
ramento. Tony has type 2 diabetes. She
is a single mom and works part-time to
care for her child, all while managing
multiple chronic conditions.
Over the last decade, the price of in-
sulin has increased 197 percent, and
those increases make it harder and
harder for a family to get by.
Under H.R. 3, drug price savings will
be passed on to families like Tony’s.
Tony could pay as little as $34 per
month, giving her family the relief
they need for other expenses.
For seniors, for families, and for all
Americans who desperately need to lift
the burden of high drug prices from
their everyday lives, I ask that my col-
leagues support this bill.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. BURGESS), the top Republican on
the Health Subcommittee of the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
In the early days of my medical prac-
tice in the 1980s, I would sit around
with other doctors and kvetch that
there were treatments available in Eu-
rope that were not available in the
United States. But Congress acted and
enacted the prescription drug user fee
agreements in 1992, sped up the regu-
latory process, and broke the regu-
latory bottleneck. The drug approval
process over the past four decades has
significantly improved to the point
that American doctors now have more
tools at their disposal to alleviate
human suffering than at any time in
the Nation’s past.

thought would be the correct path for-
ward. Indeed, in the Rules Committee
last night, we received the Statement
of Administration Policy from the
President that said he would veto H.R.
3 if presented in its current form. But
he goes on to say that H.R. 19 is a far
better approach to lowering drug prices
and discovering lifesaving cures. The
President believes there is a path for-
ward. The administration remains
committed to working with both par-
ties to pass legislation.
What H.R. 3 represents to me is a lost
opportunity. It was an opportunity to
work together. The President wanted
to work together. But it is a lost op-
portunity to bring down drug costs for
American patients. We can vote
against H.R. 3. We can support the
amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute. H.R. 19 could become law this
year, in 2019.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from
California (Mr. MCNERNEY), a member
of our committee.
Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentleman for yielding and
for bringing this bill forward. I rise in
support of H.R. 3, the Elijah E.
Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.
We are here today to debate an issue
that shouldn’t need any discussion
from Members of this body. We have all
heard from constituents back home
forced to choose between critical medi-
cations and basic needs because pre-
scription drugs are just too expensive.
Just this week, one of my constitu-
ents, Marta, shared her story with me.
Marta suffers from an autoimmune dis-
ease that causes her own body to at-
tack her muscles, and without medica-
tion, she struggles to see. Even the
slightest movement feels like a colos-
sal feat, including her breathing.
The prescription drug she needs in
order to walk or even just to breathe
was once available for free, but the
medication she is now taking costs an
outrageous $375,000 a year. Who can af-
ford that?
While Marta’s insurance covers some
of the cost, it is a constant fight for
her to get the medication she needs to
be able to live her life.
What good are miracle drugs if people
can’t afford them?
As Members of Congress, we must do
everything in our power to ensure that
people can afford lifesaving and life-
changing drugs. Under H.R. 3, the gov-
ernment would be empowered to nego-
tiate directly with the drug companies
to lower prices for the American peo-
ple.
I urge my colleagues to support H.R.
3 for Marta and the millions of Ameri-
cans burdened by skyrocketing pre-
scription drug costs.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. GUTHRIE), the top Repub-
lican on the Oversight and Investiga-
tion Subcommittee of the Energy and
Commerce Committee.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentleman for yielding. I
rise today in opposition to H.R. 3.
Two of the issues that I often hear
about back home are robocalls and
drug prices. Last week, despite ideolog-
ical differences on both sides of the
aisle, we came together to address
robocalls. I am disappointed that the
same cannot be said for drug prices.
Republicans, Democrats, President
Trump, doctors, pharmacists, patients,
we all want lower drug prices. Yet, the
Democrats have chosen to pursue par-
tisan poison pill legislation that will
go nowhere.
I was proud to cosponsor the Lower
Costs, More Cures Act, a bill that in-
cludes only bipartisan solutions to
lower drug prices. My Democratic col-
leagues have agreed to these provisions
in the past. The Lower Costs, More
Cures Act will allow the continuation
of lifesaving innovation in healthcare
research while lowering drug prices for
Kentuckians.
Mr. Chairman, I oppose H.R. 3, and I
urge my colleagues to support the
Lower Costs, More Cures Act.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from
Vermont (Mr. WELCH), a member of our
committee.
Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
We have done in our committee some
bipartisan work that attacks patent
abuse and will help bring down the
costs of drugs, but there is a question.
It is not a partisan question. It is real-
ly a judgment. Can we stop pharma
from what has been relentless price in-
creases—I would call it price gouging—
without the government intervening on
behalf of the consumer? We are the
only country where the government
sits on its hands while pharma boosts
the prices.
President Trump told Elijah that is a
rip-off. That is what the President told
Elijah, and the President said he would
be okay with bringing in safe drugs
from abroad for price negotiation, or as
the President called it, getting a better
deal.
The President’s idea, which is a good
one and incorporated in the bill, was to
have an international reference price
so we don’t pay four, five, six times
what they pay in Europe. That is a
good idea.
But bottom line, the question is, will
pharma stop killing us if we don’t step
up with governmental authority for
consumers? That is not partisan. That
is a judgment. It won’t happen without
us asserting that authority, as is done
in this bill.
Then, the benefits are extended to
employers who are struggling to pay
health insurance for their folks and
can’t give them a raise, to seniors, and
to every individual.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from West
Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY), an important
member of our committee.
Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Let’s be frank, Senate leadership has
already said they are never going to
vote on H.R. 3. Earlier today, President
Trump made it clear that he would
veto it. So what are we doing here?
If lowering the costs of prescription
drugs were really a priority for Demo-
crats, they would vote to adopt H.R. 19,
the bipartisan alternative, instead of
this politically charged bill. H.R. 19 has
35 bipartisan provisions that passed out
of the House committee. It includes 90
percent of the bipartisan Grassley-
Wyden bill in the Senate.
H.R. 19 will not only lower drug
prices, but it will protect innovation
and research into new medicines and
cures for diseases like Alzheimer’s,
rheumatoid arthritis, ALS, diabetes,
and Parkinson’s.
The Congressional Budget Office and
the Council of Economic Advisers have
both concluded that H.R. 3 will prevent
hundreds of new cures from entering
the market. Therefore, I have to ask
the supporters of H.R. 3: Which cures
for our loved ones are you willing to
sacrifice?
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. SCHRADER), a member of our
committee.
Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentleman for yielding. I
rise today to speak on behalf of H.R. 3,
the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug
Costs Now Act of 2019.
The bill before us today will finally
allow Medicare to negotiate the price
for prescription drugs to get a better
deal for our seniors, a task that has
long been successful by the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs, Medicaid, the
Department of Defense, and, frankly,
in commercial insurance plans.
Why not allow our seniors to nego-
tiate the best price for their costly
drugs? It can save the taxpayers a lot
of money. Americans support negotia-
tion.
I will point out that while I appre-
ciate the efforts to expand service, the
Medicare trustees report has shown
that the Medicare hospital insurance
trust fund is projected to be depleted
by 2026, a mere 6 years from now. At
the same time, Medicare per capita
spending is supposed to grow at a rate
of over 5 percent a year.
The savings from the drug negotia-
tion portion of this bill, at least a big
portion of it, should be put toward en-
suring that our seniors will continue to
have access to Medicare.
We cannot keep spending money we
do not have. As we continue to have
conversations around expanding access
to healthcare and lowering costs of pre-
scription drugs, I urge my colleagues
to be mindful that they need to address
the solvency of our healthcare safety
net systems.
This is a good bill. I urge support.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I want
to say that we cannot lose sight of how
anti-innovation H.R. 3 is. We cannot
lose sight of how many cures will never
come around as a result. These aren’t
my conclusions. They are, but they are
also the conclusions of the Congres-
sional Budget Office and the Council of
Economic Advisers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10103
December 11, 2019
Hundreds of new drugs will never
come to market. Medicines will never
be created. We know that 10 percent
fewer drugs will enter the market
every year in the 2030s and every year
thereafter as a result of H.R. 3.
This bill will leave people behind. It
will result in earlier deaths than other-
wise should happen.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GRIF-
FITH).
Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
In committee, I raised issues of un-
constitutional takings in H.R. 3. Nine-
ty-five percent of gross revenues are
taken from a manufacturer unless they
agree to the price the government of-
fers.
It is not negotiation. It is an offer
you can’t refuse. It is confiscatory. Ac-
cordingly, it is unconstitutional.
But you don’t have to believe me.
The nonpartisan Congressional Re-
search Service says H.R. 3 likely vio-
lates the Fifth and Eighth Amend-
ments of the United States Constitu-
tion.
Mr. Chair, I took an oath to support
the United States Constitution when I
entered this body. To support the Con-
stitution, you must vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R.
3. To fix drug pricing, you should vote
‘‘yes’’ on the Walden amendment in the
nature of a substitute.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. RUIZ), a member of our
committee.
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Chairman, I thank the
gentleman for yielding.
We already have hundreds of drugs in
the market that millions of Americans
do not have access to and cannot get
because they are not affordable. Sen-
iors in my district are walking out of
the pharmacy without their medica-
tion after seeing the out-of-pocket
costs and saying to themselves they
can’t afford it.
Many seniors are choosing between
eating and buying their groceries
versus taking their medications. They
are not taking the medicine that they
need, which puts their health and their
lives at risk.
I have heard from seniors in my dis-
trict who face up to $6,000 a month in
out-of-pocket costs for their medicine.
To quote one constituent of mine:
‘‘Prescription and healthcare costs are
an astronomical burden.’’ To quote an-
other: ‘‘Necessary medication should
not be treated as a luxury.’’
We must bring down the outrageous
out-of-pocket costs plaguing our sen-
iors and families. H.R. 3, the Elijah E.
Cummings Lowering Drug Costs Now
Act, finally answers the call to bring
down out-of-control costs.
b 1900
It does so by empowering Medicare,
for the first time ever, to negotiate
lower drug prices with Big Pharma,
which will lower costs for not only sen-
iors, but also American families with
private health insurance.
It does so by limiting out-of-pocket
costs to no more than $2,000 a year for
seniors—very important to seniors
needing expensive medication.
It does so by strengthening Medicare,
delivering vision, dental, and hearing
benefits for seniors across this country.
Every Member of the House should do
the right thing for seniors and Amer-
ican families: pass H.R. 3.
Senate Majority Leader MCCONNELL
should do his job and bring this legisla-
tion up for a vote immediately so that
we can strengthen Medicare for seniors
and lower the cost of medicine for
American families.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, I would point out that
the Republican alternative also caps
costs for seniors, again, for the first
time. We believe there is a place where
that needs to happen for our seniors.
In the committee, Republicans of-
fered up an amendment that would
have taken all the middleman profits,
the rebates, and put them toward mak-
ing insulin at no cost for seniors at the
pharmacy counter. Unfortunately,
every Democrat on the committee
voted against that. Why, I do not
know, but they did.
We want more cures and we want
lower costs. We can have both.
There is no dispute among us, Repub-
licans and Democrats, that drugs are
too high. The question is: Can we find
a scheme that is constitutional, and
does it eliminate cures for diseases
that people are relying on and shut
down innovation in America?
I think we can, by the way. I think
that is H.R. 19. We will deal with that
later.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOHNSON).
Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Madam Chair,
Americans see a Congress paralyzed by
impeachment and other distractions.
We should change course, do our job,
and put our constituents before par-
tisan politics. Reducing prescription
drug prices is a way to do that.
My friends across the aisle brag
about ‘‘affordable’’ healthcare in other
countries, but they don’t mention the
hidden costs.
Look at a young boy from Canada,
Ashton Leeds, who, in 2018, was strick-
en with an aggressive form of thyroid
cancer. Treatments approved by the
Canadian health system failed, and his
life was saved when his family brought
him to America for a cutting-edge
treatment unavailable in Canada.
This isn’t an isolated instance. As
my Republican colleagues have de-
scribed today, the data shows that H.R.
3 takes us in the wrong direction—sti-
fling innovation and reducing future
cures.
Madam Chair, Americans are des-
perately looking for relief at the phar-
macy counter, and we can give it to
them with H.R. 19, a bipartisan pro-
posal with a real chance of becoming
law, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port it.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, may I
inquire how much time remains on
each side.
The Acting CHAIR (Ms. WEXTON).
The gentleman from New Jersey has
121⁄2 minutes remaining. The gentleman
from Oregon has 12 minutes remaining.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. VEASEY), a member of our
committee.
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Chair, I thank
the chairman for really helping deliver
on the promise to work for the people
by bringing down the costs of prescrip-
tion drugs for all Americans.
This is a historic and much-needed
piece of legislation, and I am proud to
be a member of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee and Congress to
bring this bill to the floor.
This past summer, William from Ar-
lington, Texas, came into my district
office because, like so many Ameri-
cans, William was enrolled in a Medi-
care plan and was concerned with the
price of his lifesaving prescriptions.
William was worried about the price of
his generic cholesterol medicine. He
had been paying $600 a month—$600 a
month—when he went to his local
pharmacy to fill his prescription.
I am hearing all this whooping and
hollering about all these other things,
protecting these pharmaceutical drug
companies, but why is no one talking
about people like William who are hav-
ing a hard time making ends meet and
they just want some relief when it
comes to these prescription drug
prices? That is who we need to be tak-
ing care of and defending in this de-
bate.
Many seniors across the country are
living like William. They are on fixed
incomes. They are really having a hard
time making ends meet, and forcing
them to choose between paying for
their prescription drugs and their daily
necessities is really unacceptable in
our country.
That is why I am proud to stand here
with my colleagues today to voice sup-
port for H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings
Lower Drug Costs Now Act. I am proud
this legislation will ensure Medicare
beneficiaries will be covered on things
like vision, dental, and hearing bene-
fits.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman has expired.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I yield
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Texas.
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Chair, I thank
the chairman very much for yielding
me additional time.
Again, I am just proud that the
version of this bill that will help our
low-income residents all across this
country will be passed into law.
There are so many other things that
I could talk about, but I just have to
tell you, in closing, there are people
who are out there hurting. They are
making life-and-death decisions every
day and having to choose between
whether or not they are going to eat or

pay for their prescription drugs. This is
unacceptable in this country.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, I just want to point
out a couple of things.
First of all, what is really unaccept-
able is to kill off American innovation
in this space. We know from the
biotech people who are doing this inno-
vation, they have written us saying it
will shatter the hopes and dreams of
Americans waiting for cures. It will
completely upend the ecosystem of in-
novation.
America is where the innovation oc-
curs. We don’t think that has to hap-
pen to bring down the costs of drugs,
which we also support.
We also don’t think you should end
up in a system like this where, in these
countries that they want to emulate,
like Australia, Canada, France, Ger-
many, Japan, and the United Kingdom,
all new medications that we have here,
they only have between 30 and 60 per-
cent.
In fact, in cancer, there are 27 to 50
percent fewer cancer drugs in these
countries. There is a range here,
Madam Chair, that are available. So, if
you get cancer, if you were in America
here, you might get a drug that would
prolong your life or cure your cancer.
In these countries, you have a run of 27
to 50 percent chance you won’t get that
drug; diabetes, 10 to 50 percent fewer;
respiratory, 17 to 50 percent fewer.
They, in part, control their costs be-
cause they deny access to care of the
lifesaving new cutting-edge drugs that
we innovate.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Michigan (Mr.
WALBERG), a very important member of
our committee.
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Chair, as I travel across
Michigan, I constantly hear about the
high cost of prescription drugs. Hard-
working families are simply paying too
much. That is why we need to tackle
this issue in a bipartisan way, not try
to score political points.
Sadly, H.R. 3 is a partisan, heavy-
handed approach that has no chance of
becoming law.
Let’s be honest: Government doesn’t
negotiate; they dictate.
This drug pricing scheme will ulti-
mately hurt families, stifle innovation,
and prevent lifesaving cures from be-
coming available to our friends, our
neighbors, and families.
There is a better approach, a plan
that is patient-focused and filled with
bipartisan provisions that enjoys sup-
port in the Senate as well. It is H.R. 19,
the Lower Costs, More Cures Act. This
bill will strengthen transparency, en-
courage medical breakthroughs, and
make medications that families rely on
more affordable.
If the other side is serious about get-
ting something done, then we should be
voting on the Lower Costs, More Cures
Act this week.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. SOTO), my colleague.
Mr. SOTO. Madam Chair, back in
central Florida, we had a townhall
where we had everyone from BERNIE
SANDERS supporters supporting Medi-
care for all to Donald Trump Make
America Great Again, red hat-wearing
Trump supporters, and all of them, re-
gardless of the political spectrum,
could not believe Medicare can’t nego-
tiate. ‘‘What a sham’’ is what they
said.
Well, today is the day. We are going
to end the ban on Medicare negoti-
ating.
So you can wring your hands, contort
the facts, but then you are going to
have to go home and explain why you
campaigned on ending the ban on Medi-
care negotiating and then you voted
‘‘no,’’ and then you voted to keep this
sham system in place where we don’t
even allow the government to nego-
tiate for lower drug prices.
This bill caps out-of-pocket costs at
$2,000. That saves $1,196 per senior for
the over 124,000 seniors in my district.
It also applies to the 550,000 people who
have private insurance.
What do we do with the $500 billion
we save? We finally crack that injus-
tice for seniors to get dental, vision,
and hearing coverage.
We hear scare tactics: Hundreds of
drugs aren’t going to be improved. Try
8 to 15, while 300-plus drugs, according
to the CBO, will be improved over the
next 10 years. So let’s stop the scare
tactics.
And is it worth it? Of course it is
worth it.
Hundreds of new cures; finally giving
dental, vision, hearing coverage—of
course it is worth it.
$1,196 in savings per senior in my dis-
trict. Of course it is worth it.
America put us in the majority be-
cause they think it is worth it, so it is
time to pass the Lower the Drug Costs
Now Act.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, we have heard this re-
frain before that it is worth it, worth it
not to have a cure. A cure for what? We
don’t know.
We know that there are 100 drugs
that will never be developed because of
H.R. 3. That is what the Council of
Economic Advisers said. The Congres-
sional Budget Office says 38 in the next
20 years will never be developed.
Is that the cure for Alzheimer’s? Is
that the cure for Parkinson’s? Is that
the cure for ALS?
Madam Chair, the gentleman says it
is worth it to upend the entire eco-
system of innovation in America. That
is what we just heard. We heard it in
committee too: It is okay. We don’t
need a cure for this, that, or the other
thing.
138 of these great American
innovators wrote us and said it is not
worth it. This bill is going to shatter
the hopes and dreams of people who are
hoping that there will be a cure for
cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia or
SMA.
Oh, by the way, we are developing
those cures, but this bill, H.R. 3, kills
innovation in America, and that means
people will die because they didn’t get
those drugs because they were never
invented.
We don’t have to do that to bring
down the cost of drugs. There are bi-
partisan ways to bring down the cost of
drugs without destroying medical inno-
vation in America, and we want to
work with you to do this.
H.R. 3 is the purely partisan bill on
the floor.
The proposal we have is all bipar-
tisan, Republican and Democrat ideas
put together that will have a positive
effect on bringing down drug prices. It
will stop the gaming of the system, and
it will result in more cures.
Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.
CARTER), Congress’ only pharmacist, an
outspoken advocate for our legislation
and doing the right thing for patients,
whom he greeted at the pharmacy
counter every day.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Chair, I thank the gentleman for yield-
ing.
You know, I find myself in a situa-
tion here where I am both excited and
I am sad. I am finally getting the op-
portunity to address something that
was one of my major initiatives coming
to Congress, and that is to do some-
thing about prescription drug pricing.
As the ranking member noted, I am
the one, for over 30 years, who was at
the front counter telling patients how
much their medication was going to be.
I am the one who watched a mother
in tears because she couldn’t afford her
child’s medication.
I am the one who watched a senior
citizen try to decide between buying
medication and buying groceries.
Yet, never did it enter into my mind
that this was a Republican or a Demo-
crat thing. No. It never was, and it
should not be now. This is about Amer-
icans and about Americans trying to
get medications.
Now, I will tell you, in my career, in
my pharmacy career, I have witnessed
nothing short of miracles in the way of
new drugs.
I can remember a time when, if you
were diagnosed with hepatitis C, you
were going to die. That is all there was
to it. Now, think about it. We can actu-
ally cure it with a pill. How phe-
nomenal is that? That is what research
and development has done for us.
Now, do pharmaceutical manufactur-
ers need to do a better job with their
pricing? Yes, they do. But I am here to
tell you where the real problem lies. I
have been saying it ever since I have
been here for 5 years, and that is in the
middleman, in the fee PBMs, the phar-
macy benefit managers, the ones who
hide behind the curtain and are causing
this, that bring no value whatsoever to
the system. Yet H.R. 3 is going to do
away with research and development.

And, yes, you have heard it. Even if
it is 8, even if it is 15, even if it is 100,
even if it is 1, that is one too many
that doesn’t come to market. What if it

The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman has expired.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I yield
an additional 15 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Georgia.
b 1915
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Chair, this is too important. This
should not be partisan.
Thank goodness we have H.R. 19, a bi-
partisan bill. Everything that is in
H.R. 19 is bipartisan—everything. And
it brings down the cost of medication
without stymieing innovation, without
ruining research and development.
Madam Chair, I encourage Members
to support H.R. 19.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, this is a historic piece
of legislation before us this evening.
H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower
Drug Costs Now Act, is the critical ac-
tion we need to lower prescription drug
prices for Americans across the United
States.
Unfortunately, my Republican col-
leagues this evening continue to peddle
Big Pharma’s talking points and say
that this bill will stifle innovation.
Even the Trump administration’s
Health and Human Services Secretary
Alex Azar, who was a drug company ex-
ecutive himself, acknowledged that
drug companies like to claim that ‘‘if
one penny disappears from pharma’s
profit margins, American innovation
will grind to a halt.’’
Frankly, I am appalled by this argu-
ment, Madam Chair. It is the Federal
Government and the American tax-
payers who are the largest investors in
innovation.
In fact, the National Institutes of
Health, which has long enjoyed bipar-
tisan, bicameral support, is the largest
public funder of biomedical research in
the world. For decades, publicly funded
research has laid the foundation for the
treatment and cures that patients use
today.
Research shows that many patented
prescription drug products were first
discovered through taxpayer-funded
NIH research and grants.
According to a report by the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences, NIH-fund-
ed research contributed to the develop-
ment of all 210 new drugs approved by
the FDA between 2010 and 2016.
The impact is clear: Americans are
living longer, healthier lives; heart dis-
ease, stroke, and diabetes are less dead-
ly; cancer mortality rates are also,
overall, on the decline.
The Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug
Costs Now Act, H.R. 3, will strengthen
innovation—I stress, strengthen inno-
vation—by investing $10 billion of di-
rect funding to continue this momen-
tum. This money is delivered to the
agency over 10 years to provide sus-
tained, predictable investments to our
Nation’s brightest researchers at our
world-class universities and medical
research centers.
This bill will advance research in
cancer, rare diseases, regenerative
medicine, and antibiotic resistance,
among others. It also provides addi-
tional funding for phase 2 and phase 3
clinical trials.
History shows us that investments
like these will pay dividends for pa-
tients.
Madam Chair, I am just so tired of
hearing the Republican claim that H.R.
3 will kill new drug development and
innovation. It is just the same tired
fearmongering that the big pharma-
ceutical companies have used in an ef-
fort to lower their out-of-control drug
prices.
We, as Members of Congress, work for
the American people, not Big Pharma.
And now is the time for us to act and
deliver our promise to patients who
rely on prescription drugs to live long
and meaningful lives by lowering their
drug prices.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, I can’t help but just
respond. Our information is based on
fact, not rhetoric. It comes from the
independent Congressional Budget Of-
fice that works for all of us. And when
they evaluated H.R. 3, they are the
ones—at CBO, the Congressional Budg-
et Office—that said that the Demo-
crats’ plan, the Pelosi plan, would re-
sult in fewer new drug products being
developed and coming to market.
CBO is the one, not Big Pharma. You
can throw that around all you want,
but it is the Congressional Budget Of-
fice that said 38 new cures that could
be developed in the next 20 years would
be lost in development because of this
bill—38. Up to 38.
It was the Council of Economic Ad-
visers that said upwards of 100 new
cures, new medicines, would not come
to market because of H.R. 3.
The great American innovators wrote
to the Speaker and wrote to the Repub-
lican leader and said the dreams of life-
changing therapies and cures for pa-
tients would be ‘‘shattered’’ by H.R. 3.
They said that, unfortunately, H.R. 3 is
an unprecedented and aggressive gov-
ernment intervention in the U.S. mar-
ket of drug development and delivery
that will limit patient access to these
extraordinary advancements in care.
These are the people that—when they
get a cure for cystic fibrosis; when they
develop a cure for sickle cell; when,
hopefully, they develop a cure for dia-
betes—we will all rush out to say, ‘‘We
helped. We funded NIH. They did an im-
portant role.’’
And NIH funding is extremely impor-
tant, but it is these innovators that do
the actual development of the drugs. In
fact, the Congressional Budget Office
said, when it comes to H.R. 3 spending
for NIH, that the effects of the new
drug introductions from increased Fed-
eral spending under the bill on bio-
medical research would be modest—
modest. Okay.
We have all supported increases in
additional research at NIH. It is an im-
portant element of this. But it is actu-
ally the innovators spread all across
the country and these tiny little
startups, in some cases, that are beg-
ging us not to blow up the system to
get drug prices down.
We can get drug prices down. We are
willing to work on both sides of the
aisle to do that. You don’t have to de-
stroy innovation in America and life-
saving cures for patients to get there.
H.R. 3, independent analyses show,
would do exactly that.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. STIVERS).
Mr. STIVERS. Madam Chair, I thank
Ranking Member WALDEN for yielding,
and I commend him for his efforts to
limit drug prices and continue innova-
tion.
I have a concern about the increased
costs that both H.R. 3 and H.R. 19, as
well as Senate proposals, could have on
small manufacturers through the part
D redesign.
These small manufacturers often
serve the Low-Income Subsidy popu-
lation that are our most vulnerable,
and it would disproportionately affect
their access to lifesaving and life-
changing medications, such as drugs
for mental illness and addiction. H.R. 3
is catastrophic to this population.
Madam Chair, I ask to enter into a
colloquy with the gentleman from Or-
egon and seek his commitment to en-
sure small manufacturers and the LIS
population are not inadvertently penal-
ized as this process moves forward of
our alternative.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentleman from Ohio for his re-
marks. I am hopeful that, after this po-
litical exercise of H.R. 3 is done, we can
work on a bipartisan basis on needed
part D modernization like we were
doing before the Speaker, unfortu-
nately, shut down these discussions.
When we do so, I look forward to
working with the gentleman from Ohio
to ensure that the vulnerable LIS pop-
ulation is not unintentionally ad-
versely impacted.

myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, the Republicans keep
saying that they want to work with us.
We have suggested to them that the
only way to reduce prices, that I know
of—and they haven’t suggested any-
thing else—is by having some kind of
negotiation.
We are talking about the drugs for
which there is a monopoly. These are

H10106 December 11, 2019
the brand-name drugs for which there
is no competition, no generic alter-
native. Every other country, the six
that we have mentioned as part of this
bill that we are looking at, because we
subsidize them as the American people
get ripped off, Australia, Canada,
Japan, United Kingdom, and France
bring prices down considerably by ne-
gotiating.
When you have all these Medicare
beneficiaries, if you will, you have a
tremendous amount of power, if you
will, to negotiate with the drug compa-
nies because they want to sell their
drugs to bring the prices down. If you
don’t do that, which is what the Repub-
licans refuse to do, then you have no
effective way of bringing prices down.
We know that.
Now, this is why, when Medicare part
D was established—I was here how
many years ago—the Republicans in-
sisted that they put in this clause in
part D that said that the government
can’t negotiate prices.
So that is why we have to pass this
bill, because right now the government
has no power to do that.
Why not give the government that
ability? So far, they refuse to do it.
So, I know they keep saying they
want to work with us on a bipartisan
basis, but they have refused to do any
kind of negotiated prices, to get rid of
that clause that says that the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services
can negotiate prices.
The American public is getting
ripped off. We are subsidizing drugs
that are being sold in this other coun-
try. It is not fair. It is not a fair play-
ing field.
Why should we let the drug compa-
nies continue with this monopoly?
That is why we are moving H.R. 3. That
is the basis for H.R. 3.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon has 2 minutes remaining.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I yield
to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.
ALLEN) for 1 minute.
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Chair, we all
agree here that prescription drug
prices are skyrocketing, and Congress
must act. That is something that we
all agree on. The question is how do we
go about it.
A couple of facts:
One, H.R. 3 is a radical government
takeover of the pharmaceutical indus-
try, and it ultimately will prevent
Americans from accessing potentially
lifesaving cures.
Fact 2: According to the White House
Council of Economic Advisers, H.R. 3
will prevent as many as 100 fewer drugs
from entering the U.S. market in the
next decade.
Fact 3: Countries that have adopted
similar drug pricing schemes, as pro-
posed under this legislation, have expe-
rienced a decrease in access to innova-
tive new medicines, increased wait
times for treatment, and supply short-
ages for in-demand drugs.
Americans will not stand for this. We
have an alternative: H.R. 19, the Lower
Costs, More Cures Act.
I urge Members to work together in a
bipartisan way on H.R. 19.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, may I
inquire how much time is remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon has 1 minute remaining.
The gentleman from New Jersey has
31⁄2 minutes remaining.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Let’s go through this really quickly.
Democrats have said it is worth it
not to have future cures. That is point
one. They have said that: worth it not
to have future cures.
Congressional Budget Office tells us
up to 38 cures will not come about be-
cause of H.R. 3.
They have said we want to model
America after foreign countries, and
the facts show that in foreign countries
you have less access to lifesaving drugs
for cancer, diabetes, respiratory issues,
and cardiovascular.
The chart on the far side here lists
those drugs individually. We are not
making this up. This is fact. We can do
this better. We can work together.
The Congressional Budget Office said,
when we created Medicare part D—
which I was here for and supported—
that having the government in charge
of pricing would have a negligible ef-
fect in terms of the savings. I think
they believe that today.
But if you want to restrict access to
drugs, if you want to deny new cures to
patients, if you want to go on a system
where you die because the medicine is
not available in your country, then
vote for H.R. 3.
If you don’t, if you want to have
lower drug prices, stop the gaming by
the pharmaceutical companies and
have more cures, then support our al-
ternative.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, with H.R. 3 we are one
step closer to fulfilling our promise of
making prescription drugs more afford-
able for the American people.
Today, here in the United States,
drug companies can charge whatever
they want because there is no competi-
tion until a generic comes to market
and because the Federal Government
has no ability to negotiate drug prices.
The American people are getting
ripped off. The status quo is unaccept-
able and unsustainable.
In other countries negotiations
occur, and prices in those countries are
substantially lower than here in the
United States. For years the American
people have been subsidizing prescrip-
tion drugs for the rest of the world, and
we are fed up with paying 3, 4, or 10
times as much for the exact same drug
as someone in a similar developed
country.
Under H.R. 3, those days are over. We
are finally empowering the Federal
Government to negotiate lower prices
with the drug manufacturers.
Now, what we are doing with the sav-
ings that come from this bill is we are
providing additional benefits to sen-
iors.
H.R. 3 adds Medicare part B com-
prehensive dental coverage for the first
time. It adds a new dental benefit to
Medicare part D and will provide cov-
erage for screening and preventive
services. It adds a new vision coverage.
H.R. 3 adds new vision benefits that
would cover routine eye exams, contact
lens fitting, and glasses or contact
lenses once every 2 years.
b 1930
It adds a comprehensive hearing ben-
efit. It adds new hearing benefits that
provide hearing aid coverage for indi-
viduals with severe, profound hearing
loss.
The list goes on. We are investing
more money to go to NIH. We are pro-
viding more money for community
health centers. The bottom line is, we
are also trying to save seniors’ out-of-
pocket costs by capping out-of-pocket
costs at $2,000.
We are doing all this at the same
time that we are lowering prescription
drug prices through negotiation by the
Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
ices, or the Federal Government. Un-
derstand that once that price is set for
Medicare, that price is also available in
the rest of the market for those with
insurance coverage.
This is a win-win situation for the
American people. I don’t understand
how the Republicans on the other side
could say that there is any other way
to lower prescription drug prices, and
they, frankly, haven’t given us any
suggestion in that respect.
I ask my colleagues, please, this is a
transformational piece of legislation.
Please support us. This should be sup-
ported on a bipartisan basis.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Madam Chair, I rise in strong support
of H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings
Lower Drug Costs Now Act.
I am delighted to have been asked to
join with my colleagues Mr. PALLONE
and Chairman SCOTT in authoring this
historic legislation. It delivers on a
Democratic promise to meaningfully
stabilize and lower the very high costs
of prescription drugs in the United
States.
As a recent Ways and Means Com-
mittee report details, Americans pay,
on average, four times more for the
same prescription drugs as patients in

other similarly developed countries.
An overwhelming majority of Ameri-
cans, 95 percent, believe this disparity
is unacceptable. I certainly agree with
them.
H.R. 3 will level the playing field for
patients and taxpayers by giving the
Health and Human Services Secretary
the power to negotiate better prescrip-
tion drug prices in Medicare and
throughout the private market. It also
caps Medicare beneficiaries’ out-of-
pocket prescription drug spending at
$2,000.
According to CBO, H.R. 3 will save
American taxpayers over $500 billion.
We will vigorously reinvest these tre-
mendous savings into unprecedented
dental, vision, and hearing Medicare
coverage expansions.
These are benefits that are directly
associated with positive short- and
long-term health outcomes, and seniors
deserve meaningful access to them.
H.R. 3 also expands eligibility to low-
income subsidy programs so that sen-
iors can get help to lower their out-of-
pocket costs. These changes ensure
seniors can afford lifesaving medica-
tions, protect Medicare beneficiaries
with preexisting conditions from dis-
crimination, and give older Americans
access to commonly needed and life-
transforming health services. Millions
of Americans will see improvements to
their quality of life and to their finan-
cial security.
I have long believed that we need to
look at ways to reinvest in healthcare
across the spectrum, and H.R. 3 does
that by doubling our investment in ma-
ternal, infant, and early childhood
home visiting programs, a proven tool
to reduce maternal mortality and mor-
bidity.
The bill also builds on the successful
Health Profession Opportunity Grant
demonstration projects to provide a leg
up for low-income adults to fill good-
paying healthcare jobs currently un-
filled because of a lack of trained
workers. Expanding HPOG programs
will help low-income adults gain new
skills, earn good jobs, and help address
health worker shortages that exist
across our 50 States, in the U.S. terri-
tories, and in American Indian commu-
nities.
I am pleased and proud of the med-
ical innovation and research that is un-
dertaken daily around the Nation, es-
pecially in the Commonwealth of Mas-
sachusetts. But I am concerned that
this innovation is becoming out of
reach for consumers who simply cannot
afford its discoveries.
H.R. 3 gives patients the ability to
benefit from and afford innovative
drugs. In addition, the legislation rein-
vests savings from lower drug prices
back into a very important part of the
Massachusetts economy, the National
Institutes of Health, to fund additional
groundbreaking, lifesaving research.
The Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug
Costs Now Act, is a commonsense pro-
posal that will allow Americans to live
healthier lives and save money as they
move along the way.
I urge my colleagues to support this
legislation, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, why should patients
have to choose between affordable
medicines and a lifesaving cure for Alz-
heimer’s, ALS, Parkinson’s, or cancer?
Why should parents with sick children
be forced to wait longer for the newest
breakthroughs that can save their
lives? Why should Americans face
shorter lives because the costliest and
most painful drug is the one that is
never created?
At the depths of NANCY PELOSI’s drug
bill is a dangerous tradeoff of lower
drug prices in the short term but fewer
lifesaving cures in the future, and not
just a few cures lost, but many, accord-
ing to the independent Congressional
Budget Office and the Council of Eco-
nomic Advisers, up to 38 cures lost, ac-
cording to the Congressional Budget
Office, and up to 100, according to the
CEA.
The California Life Sciences Associa-
tion predicts nearly 9 of 10 new drugs
would never be available—never—from
their research and small biotech com-
panies if the Pelosi bill becomes law.
This is a cruel and false choice, which
is why this bill would quickly die with
no real bipartisan support in the Sen-
ate.
As Republicans, we believe we need
to do both, lower drug prices and accel-
erate new lifesaving cures. Our bill, the
Lower Costs, More Cures Act, lowers
out-of-pocket costs for Americans by
cracking down on overpriced drugs and
empowering seniors to choose the right
place to get medicines, which can cut
the cost of chemotherapy in half, pull-
ing back the curtain on those who set
drug prices, forcing drug companies to
justify their increases and list their
prices in their ads.
We accelerate, not kill, lifesaving
medical cures. We permanently make
it easier for Americans to deduct high
medical expenses from their taxes. We
allow them to use their health savings
accounts for over-the-counter medi-
cines, including feminine hygiene prod-
ucts, and save seniors over $300 each
year on their medicines in the popular
Medicare prescription drug program.
All of these proven ideas are bipar-
tisan. All of these can be passed by
Congress. All of these can be signed by
President Trump this year if Demo-
crats abandon their partisan games and
recontinue what was our bipartisan
work that got shelved for the Pelosi
drug bill.
I will finish with this. As a member
of the Ways and Means Committee, we
in the Republican Congress joined with
President George Bush in 2003 to create
an affordable drug plan for seniors. At
the time, Speaker PELOSI and Demo-
crats tried their best to kill it. She fa-
mously predicted that trading the cru-
cial part D prescription plan for the el-
derly would end ‘‘Medicare as we know
it.’’
Can you imagine how many seniors’
lives would have been lost if she had
succeeded in stopping the affordable
Medicare drug program that 43 million
seniors have come to depend upon
today?
NANCY PELOSI and Democrats were
dangerously wrong then. Can Ameri-
cans afford the pain and risk when they
are dangerously wrong again?
Madam Chair, we have an alternative
that lowers costs and accelerates cures
in H.R. 19. That is the solution.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. DOGGETT).
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Chair, there
is only one problem with this bipar-
tisan plan that the Republicans have
embraced: It will not lower manufac-
turers’ prescription drugs prices by a
penny.
As to the phony argument that there
are some cures out there that will be
lost by this legislation, it also does not
stand the test of analysis. The sugges-
tion is that 8 out of 200 drugs over the
next 10 years may not be presented.
Not new cures, but in many cases, if we
look at the current market, these are
simply reformulations of existing drugs
that manufacturers use to extend their
monopoly positions.
All of this about a bill that, frankly,
I am not all that enthusiastic. I think
this legislation was originally ad-
vanced as a narrow approach to win
over Republicans, and that doesn’t ap-
pear to have been too successful this
evening.
For that purpose, it may have merit.
But as a model for comprehensive fu-
ture legislation on prescription price
gouging by government-approved mo-
nopolies, this narrow measure does not.
Its negotiation scope is restricted to
insulin and certain high-cost, high-vol-
ume drugs.
Despite our pledge to repeal the Re-
publican-imposed prohibition of Medi-
care negotiation, it still remains ille-
gal, a violation of Federal law to nego-
tiate lower prices for two-thirds of the
medications covered by Medicare. That
includes EpiPens and many other
treatments.
No negotiation for lower prices is as-
sured even when the taxpayers paid for
much of the research to develop the
drugs.
Price gouging is not limited to one
disease or one class of drugs. This bill
also does not provide any guarantee to
30 million uninsured Americans that
they will get any lower prices.
I look forward to a new Congress
with a President who wants to follow
the campaign promises that President
Trump has ignored, to provide relief for
all Americans with a comprehensive
solution to contain this Big Pharma
monopoly power.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Chair, I am
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Indiana (Mrs.
WALORSKI), one of our key members on

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H10108 December 11, 2019
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Chair, I
rise today in strong opposition to H.R.
3.
This misguided, partisan legislation
was written behind closed doors. It will
result in fewer cures, less innovation,
and worse health outcomes. We all
agree that prescription drug afford-
ability is a vital issue for the American
people. However, we shouldn’t be sacri-
ficing new cures in the process. The bill
tells patients with cancer, Alzheimer’s,
and other terrible diseases to keep
waiting for the cures they so des-
perately need.
That is why I support H.R. 19, the
Lower Costs, More Cures Act. This bi-
partisan bill will lower out-of-pocket
spending while also protecting access
to new medicines and cures.
Madam Chair, we have an important
opportunity to work in a bipartisan
fashion for the American people. But
here we are again, considering a par-
tisan bill that has no path forward in
the Senate. This has become such a dis-
turbing trend.
I urge my colleagues to vote against
this flawed legislation so we can work
together on a bipartisan solution.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Oregon
(Mr. BLUMENAUER).
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chair, I
appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy,
and I appreciate his leadership.
I strongly urge that my colleagues
reject the cynical approach that is
being advanced by our Republican
friends. Think about it for a moment.
We are talking about challenging the
monopoly that the Republicans gave,
making it illegal to negotiate drug
prices.
As a result, we have heard already in
the course of this debate that our con-
stituents pay four times more, on aver-
age, than other countries. Sometimes
it is 67 times as much.
What would happen if we were able to
slightly restrain that monopoly power
and have a little competition? The Re-
publicans are so cynical that they say
the first thing the drug companies will
do is not cut executive bonuses, not cut
back on stock buybacks, not cut back
on bizarre advertising. The first thing
the pharmaceutical industry would do,
in the vision of the Republicans, is cut
back on vital research.
b 1945
Give me a break. They already spend
less on research than they do on the
items that I have mentioned.
I really believe that, even though we
have big differences with them—and I
think we settled some of those scores
in the recent trade negotiations—I
have a hard time believing that they
would make patients suffer instead of
cutting back a little bit on executive
compensation or stock buybacks.
I am proud that we have stood firm
against Big Pharma in our trade nego-
tiations, and I hope my colleagues will
vote in favor of this legislation that
will lower prescription drug prices by
almost $2,000 per average family.
It will have savings that will expand
Medicare benefits to include dental, vi-
sion, and hearing—critical benefits for
the older constituents whom we all
represent.
It reinvests the savings in Federal
health programs, drug innovation, and
medical research.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman has expired.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Chair, I yield the
gentleman from Oregon an additional
15 seconds.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chair,
reject this cynical view that the drug
companies will punish consumers be-
fore they will restrain some of the ex-
cesses if we finally take back part of
the monopoly powers that the Repub-
licans gave to the pharmaceutical in-
dustry.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Chair, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT), who is one of
our leaders in technology in
healthcare.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Chair,
this is one of those, the tyranny of the
clock as we have talked about, 3 min-
utes.
There are so many things here we
agree upon about the rage we feel when
we see the pricing mechanisms and
those things. But there are so many
things also being said here that are ab-
solutely wrong, from what is happening
in Big Pharma to the new biologics
that are coming from the small re-
search companies, that I believe, actu-
ally, H.R. 3 is going to do incredible vi-
olence to our society.
Madam Chair, you have to under-
stand. We are living in the time of mir-
acles. There are cures coming that
would not happen under H.R. 3.
The single shot that cures hemo-
philia, one of most expensive diseases
in our chronic population, that single
shot is going to be outrageously expen-
sive; but it is actually dramatically
cheaper than just 3 or 4 years of living
with the disease.
Madam Chair, here is actually one of
my incredible concerns.
You do understand the pricing effi-
ciency you are importing. This is a ref-
erence pricing bill.
Madam Chair, what is a year of your
life worth? Madam Chair, what is a
year of your life worth if you are
healthy? One year of healthy life, what
is it worth to you, Madam Chair?
Because, Madam Chair, if you are in
Great Britain, it is $37,000. If the drug
comes in at $37,001, it is not purchased.
That is the efficiency you are about to
import into our country. You are going
to do this.
There are countries here where, if a
pharmaceutical breakthrough is $19,000
and it would give you 1 year of healthy
life, they don’t buy it. That is what
you are importing. You are importing
this type of cruelty.
You get to look at someone’s face
and say: Look, we imported that Euro-
pean model that basically said that
your life is not worth that to us for you
to be healthy for another year.
We are better than this. We can do
better.
We both passionately agree the pric-
ing mechanisms are crappy. The way
capital is moved around is unfair. But
H.R. 3 is going to do so much more
damage.
And I think I can build you a finan-
cial model that says that you will
lower some people’s drug prices and
you will raise the cost of, functionally,
healthcare in our country because the
cures that are coming don’t come any-
more.
Madam Chair, do you really want to
import that type of cruelty into our so-
ciety?
Mr. NEAL. Madam Chair, if the gen-
tleman asked me what a year of my life
was worth, I would have said: An awful
lot.
But I am appreciative of the fact that
you were mute on that issue, Madam
Chair.
Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.
PASCRELL).
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Chair, I
want to thank FRANK PALLONE, RICH-
ARD NEAL, and BOBBY SCOTT for all
their hard work on the Elijah E.
Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.
The science and innovation behind
lifesaving drugs is light-years beyond
our wildest imagination.
As the medicine chest of America,
New Jersey leads the way in bio-
pharmaceutical research, which is inte-
gral to discovering lifesaving treat-
ments. But with the blessing of living
longer, the curse of high costs lingers.
After too many years of inaction, it
falls on us to address exploding costs in
the health system.
Pharmaceutical innovation demands
the best science, not the highest prices.
But if medications are not affordable
for all, how can they be lifesaving?
H.R. 3 is landmark legislation that
helps us address the cost crisis by al-
lowing Medicare to negotiate fair
prices for American families.
We talked about this in 2009. The mi-
nority rejected it then, too. We should
have done it then.
Medicare beneficiaries, our seniors,
will save $150 billion in lower premiums
and out-of-pocket costs. On top of that,
Medicare part D beneficiaries will see
an average discount of nearly 55 per-
cent on current prices of the first drugs
chosen for negotiation.
Our seniors will ultimately benefit
from lower premiums, cost sharing,
and a cap on their out-of-pocket ex-
penses.
By the way, Medicare would finally,
at long last, cover dental, hearing, and
vision care services to help our seniors
stay healthy—instead of bumper stick-
ers and empty promises.
This legislation requires drug manu-
facturers to justify price increases and
launch prices for drugs. By making this
information public, manufacturers will
be accountable.
This bill also includes a reauthoriza-
tion of the Health Profession Oppor-
tunity Grants program, or HPOG, to

provide education and training to low-
income individuals for health occupa-
tions that are in high demand or are
experiencing labor shortages.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Chair, I yield 4
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. KELLY), who is a small
business person who has always offered
quality healthcare for his workers.
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam
Chair, I am going to read a letter from
a family back in Pennsylvania, the
Stewarts, Sara, Michael, and their
three daughters: Maddie, Gilly, and
Daphne. It start off this way:
Dear Congressman Kelly, my name is Sara
Stewart, and I am from Saint Petersburg,
Pennsylvania. It is my understanding that
the House Ways and Means Committee is
having a public hearing on H.R. 3, the Lower
Drug Costs Now Act of 2019.
Now, it appears this legislation does not
have bipartisan support. It needs to take a
more balanced approach. The balance is
needed for patients like my 10-year-old
daughter, Maddie.
Maddie suffers from a rare mitochondrial
deletion condition called Pearson syndrome,
which is a disorder that occurs as a result of
mutated genes in the body. These genes im-
pact mitochondria of her cells that prevent
them from producing enough energy for the
body to function properly.
Pearson syndrome is difficult to diagnose
because it affects each individual differently.
Maddie’s symptoms through the years have
included being blood transfusion-dependent
for several years, the inability to heal after
heat and Sun exposure, becoming type 1 dia-
betic, progressively losing her hearing and
her vision, kidney failure, and several other
daily complications, including develop-
mental delays from having a body that runs
on limited energy. It has been truly heart-
breaking to see her endure this disease, but
she continues to defy the odds.
My message is simple to you, Mr. KELLY,
and to the rest of the committee: There is no
cure or treatment for Pearson syndrome.
There isn’t any right now. Each day is a
struggle to keep Maddie balanced so her
body is able to better cope with the symp-
toms of this terrible disorder.
All we have—as well as many other fami-
lies across the world—is hope. Please don’t
let partisan bickering impact the ability of
researchers to discover and innovate new
therapies that could save Maddie’s life one
day. The clock is ticking, and Maddie is
waiting.
Madam Chair, I went to visit the
Stewarts. I saw this adorable child, and
her mom told me: She has so much en-
ergy today, and we are really excited
that she is feeling this way when you
came to see her.
When I looked at the Stewart family,
when I looked at Maddie, when I looked
at her sister Gilly, and when I looked
at her sister Daphne, I thought: This
isn’t fair. She has never had a chance
to live her life. She has already doubled
the chances of what the life expectancy
is. The mom is saying please don’t let
political bickering stand in the way of
developing and innovating a new
source that could save Maddie’s life.
Last year, there were 80-some chil-
dren who had the same condition as
Maddie. This Christmas, hopefully, the
40 who are left will have the chance to
celebrate it.
Now, I don’t know how the Stewarts
are registered. I don’t know if the
Stewarts vote, and I don’t care. But I
do know how the Stewarts pray, and
they pray every night not just for
Maddie, but for all the rest of the chil-
dren who have this horrible disease.
The other thing they pray for is that,
in the people’s House and on the floor
of the people’s House, we don’t look at
each other as Republicans and Demo-
crats, that we look at each other the
way we really are: We are moms and
dads. We are grandmas and grandpas
and aunts and uncles.
If we cannot come here and agree
that the hallmark of America has al-
ways been her ability to develop, to in-
novate, and to be the savior of the rest
of the world, then what are we doing?
Do we really want to make this a po-
litical battle, or do we want to start
developing policy that is about people
and not political power?
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman has expired.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Chair, I yield
the gentleman an additional 1 minute.
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam
Chair, do we really want to look in the
eyes of a 9-year-old or a 10-year-old and
say to that child: It is not just in the
cards right now because we can’t get
together as adults and do the right
thing for the right reasons and let good
things happen.
No. We have allowed ourselves to be
so damned political and so damned di-
vided that we turn our backs on the
people who sent us here.
Maddie Stewart can’t develop the
drug herself. Mr. and Mrs. Stewart
can’t develop the drug themselves. The
people of Saint Petersburg, Pennsyl-
vania, can’t help Maddie develop a
drug. But we can. We can by passing
legislation and looking not at H.R. 3,
because you know it stops innovation.
Forget all the rest of the talk. It is
all about innovation. It is about some-
thing new, something better, and some-
thing great that is going to save some-
body’s life.
Let’s look at H.R. 19. Let’s talk
about the substitute, the Lower Costs,
More Cures Act.
I wish we all had unlimited time to
speak on this issue, but we don’t. The
clock is ticking. It is ticking for
Maddie Stewart in Saint Petersburg,
Pennsylvania.
Please do the right thing for the
right reasons, and good things are
going to happen.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Chair, a reminder
that our bill will invest $10 billion in
the National Institutes of Health for
new and innovative cures.
Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from Chicago, Illinois
(Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS).
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I rise in strong support
of H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings
Lower Drug Costs Now Act. It is the so-
lution whose time has come.
According to the CBO, this bill will
save $448 billion from Medicare alone,
which can be used to provide other
services to seniors and people with dis-
abilities.
I thank the Democratic leadership
for including my bills to reduce mater-
nal mortality and morbidity by dou-
bling the MIECHV program and by ex-
panding the successful Health Profes-
sion Opportunity Grants program to

Madam Chair, Elijah Cummings

b 2000
Mr. BRADY. Madam Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois
(Mr. LAHOOD), who is a dynamic mem-
ber of the Ways and Means Committee.
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Chair, and I
rise tonight in opposition to H.R. 3, the
fewer cures and more government price
control act.
While everyone recognizes that the
overall cost of prescription drugs is too
high, and that there are some bad ac-
tors in the system, I wonder why we
are here tonight debating this legisla-
tion that essentially puts in place an
arbitrary government price setting sys-
tem. We should be, instead, finding
ways to encourage more companies to
engage in research for cures and drive
competition for lower costs.
During consideration of H.R. 3 in our
Ways and Means Committee, I au-
thored a commonsense amendment to
exempt any drug or biological product
used to treat or cure Alzheimer’s from
the definition of ‘‘negotiation eligible
drug,’’ essentially ensuring through
this amendment that Alzheimer’s re-
search remains intact, so that the sci-
entists and the researchers and the
Ph.D.’s that are working hard every
day to find a cure can continue to do
that uninterrupted. Unfortunately, the
amendment was defeated.
We already know from a CBO esti-
mate that 38 cures will not come to
market because of the legislation over
the next two decades. It essentially
cuts off at the knees innovation and
deters the work that goes on today.
The impact of future treatments and
cures for diseases like Alzheimer’s and
dementia is unacceptable. An impact
on even one cure is one too many, let
alone 38.
Instead, we have an alternative. The
House should support H.R. 19, the
Lower Cost, More Cures Act, which
consists of over 40 bipartisan provi-
sions that President Trump may actu-
ally sign to help lower the cost of pre-
scription drugs for all of our constitu-
ents.
It is disappointing that Democrats
won’t work across the aisle to solve
this problem, and instead, are pushing
a bill that will stifle innovative
healthcare solutions and result in
fewer life-saving cures and the research
that goes into Alzheimer’s.
I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R.

H10110 December 11, 2019
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam
Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 3,
the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug
Costs Now Act.
I am particularly proud of a provi-
sion that I worked on with Speaker
PELOSI to improve a provision in the
original bill that caps out-of-pocket
spending for Medicare part B bene-
ficiaries at $2,000 annually.
My proposal further protects seniors
by allowing them to pay these out-of-
pocket costs in equal installments over
12 months, rather than all at once.
The final version of H.R. 3 also in-
cludes a bill I introduced earlier this
month, H.R. 4669, the Maximizing Drug
Coverage for Low-Income Seniors Act.
This is smart and innovative legisla-
tion that will ensure seniors are en-
rolled in the best Medicare part D pro-
gram for their individual needs, not
just randomly assigned.
This will save them money on out-of-
pocket costs as well as improve access
to their needed medication, while also
generating savings in overall Medicare
spending that can be reinvested in the
program.
Madam Chair, in the richest Nation
in the world, every American should be
able to afford their life-saving medica-
tion.
I urge my colleagues to support this
groundbreaking legislation and to vote
for H.R. 3.

minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. JUDY CHU).
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam
Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 3,
the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug
Costs Now Act.
Americans are sick and tired of get-
ting fleeced by Big Pharma and have
had enough of skyrocketing prescrip-
tion drug prices.
In my district, an uninsured patient
with diabetes has to pay $655 for a
monthly supply of Novolog Flexpen, a
popular brand of insulin. But, in Can-
ada, that same supply of insulin can be
purchased for just $47.
This is outrageous. Why should
Americans have to pay so much more
than any other developed country for
the exact same medications? Why
should my constituents have to plan
trips to Mexico and Canada to get the
medications they need to stay alive?
Because even with the cost of travel, it
is still cheaper to buy their insulin
abroad. And why are drug company
profits soaring while patients go bank-
rupt? This is simply not right.
H.R. 3 is a landmark piece of legisla-
tion. It gives Medicare the power to ne-
gotiate for lower prices directly with
the drug companies. It makes those
lower prices available to those with
private insurance. Seniors will not
have to pay more than $2,000 out-of-
pocket for their drugs. And drug com-
panies can no longer rip off Americans
while charging other countries less for
the same drug.
This bill is an important first step in
addressing the skyrocketing cost of
prescription drugs. I am proud to stand
here today as a cosponsor of H.R. 3.
And I am committed to continuing our
work for the people to bring down the
cost of prescription drugs for all Amer-
icans.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE).
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Chair, I thank the chair-
man and all the colleagues of mine on
both sides of the aisle and my com-
mittee, the Ways and Means Com-
mittee.
What a perfect illustration of the dif-
ference in priorities between the two
parties. The major health initiative of
the opposite party, when they were in
power 2 years ago, was to repeal the Af-
fordable Care Act, which would have
taken away healthcare from more than
20 million Americans.
Yet, now the House, under Demo-
cratic leadership, is considering a
major priority on this side of the aisle,
H.R. 3. A bill that, according to the
Congressional Budget Office, will save
on drug costs of $500 billion for the
American people.
Now, there are many reasons why I
support H.R. 3, and I am proud to do so,
but I want to highlight, especially, just
one of them. This legislation would
generate $10 billion to fight the opioid
crisis, setting aside resources for the
localities that have been impacted the
most. That includes many rural areas
in our country, but it also includes
urban areas as well, especially in my
district, in my hometown of Philadel-
phia.
I am proud to stand here and support
H.R. 3. This is one of the most impor-
tant things we can do for the American
people: save prescription drug costs.
Madam Chair, I urge its support.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. EVANS).
Mr. EVANS. Madam Chair, I am
proud to stand before you and offer my
support for H.R. 3, the Elijah E.
Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.
One issue that has a significant im-
pact on my constituents is the sky-
rocketing cost of insulin. Across Penn-
sylvania, more than 1 million people
live with diabetes and can spend any-
where from $1,200 to $20,000 on insulin
medication each year. Over the past
decades, the price of insulin has in-
creased 197 percent.
When I think about the impact that
these price hikes have on my constitu-
ents, the first person that comes to my
mind is a young man by the name of
Chase. Chase is from Philadelphia. He
was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at
the age of 3. He came to my office not
long ago.
Chase told me that he and his mother
needed Members of Congress to do
something about the cost of insulin be-
cause he was worried about the burden
it was placing on his mother, even
though his illness was brought on
through no fault of his own.
Chase walked me through each step
of his journey with his illness. He told
me what he and his mother do on a
daily basis to manage the diabetes. He
is strong in his message that we need
to do something about this rising cost.
Chase is 10 years old. He did not choose
this, and neither did the other 30 mil-
lion Americans across the country.
Under H.R. 3, there will be a reduc-
tion in insulin. It is important that I
stand with my colleagues today and
support H.R. 3, which includes my bill.
It is important that this bill will help
seniors afford healthcare costs by in-
creasing the number of them who are
eligible for the Medicare Savings Pro-
grams. No one chooses to be sick, and
no one chooses illness for their chil-
dren.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to vote in favor of this legislation. It is
time to act.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois
(Mr. SCHNEIDER).
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Chair,
today the House is taking long overdue
action in fulfilling our promise to the
American people to lower the cost of
prescription drugs. Medical research
has fueled lifesaving advancements in
medicine, but these innovations remain
out of reach for too many due to exor-
bitantly high costs.
Tragically, 3 in 10 adults reported not
taking their medicines as prescribed at
some point because of the cost. Even
those who can afford their prescrip-
tions are charged prices many times
higher than in other developed coun-
tries. This is simply unacceptable.
H.R. 3 puts us on a path towards a
more equitable healthcare system
where cost is no barrier to getting the
care patients need. In particular, I
want to highlight my legislation, the
Protecting Medicare Beneficiaries with
Preexisting Conditions Act, now in-
cluded in H.R. 3 as Section 801.
More than 13 million beneficiaries
have a supplemental insurance policy
known as Medigap. Medigap helps
lower out-of-pocket costs, but some 30
million more Americans are unable to
buy a Medigap plan without being
charged more for a preexisting condi-
tion. Specifically, disabled Americans
under 65 and Medicare Advantage en-
rollees are not afforded the same cov-
erage guarantees as nearly every other
American.
The Affordable Care Act rightly
eradicated discrimination for pre-
existing conditions in the individual
market. We need to finally right this
wrong for Medicare beneficiaries as
well, and that is exactly what this bill
does.
I look forward to this Chamber pass-
ing H.R. 3 to give more Americans
peace of mind when buying their insur-
ance and standing at the pharmacy
counter. I hope all my colleagues on

both sides of the aisle will join me in
supporting this bill.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Chair, I yield
myself 1 minute.
Madam Chair, the Republican alter-
native to Lower Cost, More Cures Act
is based on both parties working to-
gether. In fact, we were doing so until
Speaker PELOSI blew this up with H.R.
3, written in secret, without any Re-
publican input.
Our bill contains 36 different provi-
sions that passed unanimously out of
the Committee on Ways and Means and
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce. Madam Chair, 17 provisions that
passed out of the House of Representa-
tives also with bipartisan support; 28
different provisions that passed out of 3
different Senate committees with bi-
partisan support, and 21 of these provi-
sions from the Grassley-Wyden Drug
Pricing Package.
When this partisan bill dies, H.R. 3,
we Republicans will be ready to take
up these bipartisan measures because
we agree—Democrats and Repub-
licans—we need to lower drug prices,
and we need to accelerate these cures.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. SUOZZI).
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Chair, I thank
Chairman NEAL for yielding me time.
Madam Chair, I rise in strong support
of H.R. 3. I think this is one of the
most important issues facing America
today. The American people are hun-
gering for a solution to this problem.
On January 11, 2017, President-elect
Trump said, when referring to the
pharmaceutical companies, ‘‘these
guys are getting away with murder.’’
For too long, Big Pharma has cashed
in because our government, the largest
purchaser of prescription drugs in the
world, has been prohibited from negoti-
ating lower drug prices. Americans pay
nearly four times as much for prescrip-
tion drugs as people in other countries.
H.R. 3 will finally give the United
States Government the power to nego-
tiate lower prices. It will stop unjusti-
fied price hikes and put a cap on Medi-
care part D beneficiary out-of-pocket
costs.
The $500 billion in cost savings will
be used to create historic Medicare im-
provements, such as dental, vision, and
hearing benefits. This bill will also pro-
vide financial support for more Medi-
care beneficiaries, will boost funding
for scientific innovation, will invest in
community health centers, and will
provide more money to fight the opioid
epidemic.
I thank Chairman NEAL for also in-
cluding a provision I wrote to help pro-
tect seniors that will require Medicare
prescription drug plans to publicly dis-
close information about when bene-
ficiaries are denied at the pharmacy
counter.
b 2015
I want to thank Congressman REED
for helping in that legislation. I am
honored to cosponsor this historic
piece of legislation.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Chair, I am
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES), one of
our new members of the Ways and
Means Committee who is really
thoughtful on healthcare.
Mr. ESTES. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition to H.R. 3, a bill that should
be called the fewer cures and more gov-
ernment price controls act.
My colleagues know this partisan bill
is another that is dead on arrival in the
Senate, but it didn’t have to be this
way. I truly wish that my colleagues
across the aisle had not abandoned the
good faith, bipartisan negotiations on a
realistic, workable solution to fix soar-
ing drug prices.
Instead, H.R. 3 was changed after it
was passed out of committee to please
extreme voices on the left and become
a giveaway for radical policies.
Even the nonpartisan Congressional
Budget Office said H.R. 3 will result in
fewer cures and fewer drugs coming to
market, and current drugs being pulled
from the market.
That means that, while H.R. 3 may
lower drug prices today, it comes at
the expense of fewer cures being devel-
oped in the future and more govern-
ment controls.
We should not be forced to choose be-
tween lower prices or less innovation,
just like no one should have to choose
between paying for groceries or paying
for their medication.
We must address this issue. But in-
stead of H.R. 3, I encourage my col-
leagues to join me in supporting an
amendment before us based on H.R. 19,
the Lower Costs, More Cures Act.
This amendment, and the H.R. 19 bill,
will use bipartisan reforms to lower
prices, protect access to new medica-
tions, strengthen transparency with
drug companies and PBMs, and allow
competition to thrive.
I know this will help people across
our country, like a community phar-
macist I heard from in a rural area in
my district. Unfortunately, retroactive
and unpredictable fees to PBMs total-
ing $45,000, just in 2018 alone, have left
it hard for this business to stay afloat
and to serve patients in this rural com-
munity.
Unlike H.R. 3, our bipartisan solution
will help give him and other commu-
nity pharmacists, particularly in rural
areas, the needed stability and predict-
ability.
This is just one way today’s amend-
ment and H.R. 19 will help patients
lower their out-of-pocket-costs and
help keep more cures coming to mar-
ket.
And furthermore, unlike H.R. 3, this
measure could be passed and delivered
to the President’s desk this year and
provide real relief to our seniors.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Nevada
(Mr. HORSFORD).
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Chair, I
thank the chairman for his steadfast
leadership.
I rise today to speak in support of
H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower
Drug Costs Now Act of 2019.
I support this bill because of one of
my constituents, Steven Pastrone, who
lives with multiple sclerosis. He
shared: ‘‘My whole right side of my
body was weaker than my left and I
had a hard time cognitively doing any-
thing.’’
Steven was not able to access his
medication, which cost $35,000 per
treatment, more than many Nevadans
earn annually, so he had to rely on a
cost-assistance program from the drug
manufacturer.
So many people in our country are in
Steven’s position and cannot access
their lifesaving medications outright.
Chairman Elijah Cummings would say:
‘‘We are better than that.’’
My constituents who stop me at
church and at recreation centers don’t
tell me that they are Democrat, Repub-
lican, or Independent. They tell me
that they have diabetes; they have can-
cer; they have heart disease; they have
asthma; and they want this Congress to
do something, to act.
So this week, we finally tell Ameri-
cans across this country that we value
your health more than Big Pharma
profits, and we will pass H.R. 3, to
lower drug costs now.
I want to thank the chairman and
the Members of this body, my col-
leagues, for working so hard. This is
one of the most important issues that
this Congress can act on, and I am
proud to be a sponsor of this important
legislation.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Chair, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Chair, I have no
further speakers, and I am prepared to
close.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Patients or politics—that is really
the choice we have today when we vote
on these different drug pricing bills.
There is a path forward that chooses
politics. This path takes a partisan ap-
proach and throws away months of Re-
publicans and Democrats working to-
gether to lower drug prices.
Experts tell us this will delay or
eliminate medical breakthroughs and
lifesaving cures for American families.
This piece of legislation is poten-
tially unconstitutional, one that leads
to patient access restrictions while giv-
ing more power to foreign bureaucrats
to set prices for American patients
right here.
And at what cost?
To save a few dollars in the short
term for a dramatically worse land-
scape in America that discourages
science, research, and discovery.
So I think of Representative KELLY’s
young girl, Mattie Stuart, St. Peters-
burg, Pennsylvania. She has a
Facebook page, Mattie’s Followers. Go
to that page. Understand how patients
are waiting for us, for those new cures.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H10112 December 11, 2019
I think of my friends in my neighbor-
hood. We had a neighbor who died from
a rare brain cancer. I have another who
is fighting a glioblastoma; another
neighbor, a very dynamic friend, who is
now struggling with Parkinson’s; two
friends who have died from ALS; and
my friends, acquaintances, coworkers
who they or their parents struggle with
dementia and Alzheimer’s.
This bill, from Speaker PELOSI, in my
view, just rips hope, robs hope from
people waiting and praying for those
cures. There is no way there are not
fewer cures.
The Congressional Budget Office esti-
mates that up to $1 trillion will be
taken away from research and science
and revenues that are invested in drugs
and new discoveries.
Some say, well, the drug companies—
and everyone seems to hate them—but
the drug companies can just not do as
many ads, can just shift some money
around.
But let me put it in perspective. Drug
companies could not spend a dime on
any advertisement for the next 25
years; they couldn’t make up what is
taken from this bill.
We could zero out National Institutes
of Health for a quarter century. That is
what $1 trillion in research and dis-
covery investment does.
You are in denial if you don’t know
there will be fewer cures—whether it is
38, whether it is 100, whether it is
something in between. No one can tell
us that cure that is lost won’t be the
one for Alzheimer’s, ALS, Parkinson’s,
or for cancer.
This is the path Republicans reject.
We believe that is too high a price to
pay for this bill, because we think
there is a bipartisan road right in front
of us that we can take together, one
that chooses patients and their needs.
And I am convinced Democrats believe,
with us, that we can do both.
I believe, with goodwill and good
ideas, we can do this Lower Costs,
More Cures Act. It sets out what Chair-
man Richie Neal and I set out to do in
February of this year. We wrote that
now is ‘‘the time to take meaningful
action to lower the cost of prescription
drugs in the U.S.’’
We said we are committed to working
together to end this cycle while pre-
serving access to lifesaving innova-
tions. I believe we can do that.
I believe the solution isn’t in H.R. 3.
That is as dead as can be. I think the
solution is H.R. 19 and working to-
gether to fine-tune it even better by
accelerating, not killing, lifesaving
medical cures; by doing what we have
already said is bipartisan: driving out-
of-pocket costs down; expanding health
savings accounts; deducting medical
expenses; letting people use their FHAs
more; saving seniors by redesigning
part D; forcing drug companies to jus-
tify their increases, to pull that cur-
tain back on how they price those
drugs; everyone along the system,
making them, forcing them to pay
more of the drug burdens in Medicare
part D.
And together, we can tell families
suffering from Alzheimer’s, ALS, Par-
kinson’s, cancer, and so many other ill-
nesses that we are committed together
to finding a cure.
My vote today will be on behalf of pa-
tients. It will be on behalf of bipartisan
solutions. It will be cast with the hope
that a future cure for cancer can be
discovered and developed right here in
America, sooner rather than later.
I know my Republican colleagues
will join with me in that fight as well,
and I ask my friends, my Democrat col-
leagues, to do the same.
Let me be clear on that. I think there
are Democrats who have come here to
solve problems but find themselves
boxed out by the Speaker’s top-down
approach. My simple request is, join us
in fighting for a bipartisan solution,
H.R. 19, no matter how you will eventu-
ally vote on H.R. 3.
Send a signal that it is not too late
for the Matties of the world. It is not
too late. We can deliver a bipartisan
win for lower drug prices and that cure
we all pray for for our families and
loved ones.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Chair, I yield my-
self the balance of my time.
Addressing the rising cost of pre-
scription drugs is a complicated issue,
as Mr. BRADY has noted, and it needs a
thoughtful approach. H.R. 3 is a crit-
ical step toward a long-term, sustain-
able solution.
A lot of hard work went into crafting
this measure and, indeed, bringing it to
the floor. And there are a number of
staff to thank.
From the Legislative Counsel’s Of-
fice: Jessica Shapiro, Karl Hagnauer,
Lisa Castillo, Adam Schilt, Fiona
Heckscher, James Grossman, and
Henry Christup.
From CBO: Tom Bradley—who, I
might add, is retiring after long and
distinguished service, and we thank
him for that—Paul Masi, Rebecca Yip,
Lara Robillard, Chad Chirico, Alice
Burns, Stuart Hammond, Lori
Housman, Jennifer Gray, and Leo Lex.
From the Joint Committee on Tax-
ation: Tom Barthold, Vivek
Chandrasekhar, Shelley Leonard, Chia
Chang, Lin Xu, and James Elwell.
From CMS: Manda Newlin, Maia
Larsson, Ira Burney, Lisa Yen, Jen
Druckman, Stacy Harms, Leigh Feld-
man, and Jenny Keroack.
And, of course, as always, I want to
thank the staff of the Ways and Means
Committee, who, as usual, have worked
tirelessly and effectively on this legis-
lation. The legislation before this
House today is in no small part because
of their expertise and their commit-
ment to improving the healthcare for
all members of the American family.
I thank Amy Hall, Sarah Levin,
Melanie Egorin, Rachel Dolin, Orriel
Richardson, Neil Patil, and Morna Mil-
ler.
As we have heard today on the floor,
there are a lot of views on how to lower
prescription drugs, and I am open to
suggestions. One policy is not going to
be the final fix, but this legislation is
an important, impactful first step, and
I welcome continued dialogue on both
sides of the aisle.
I urge my colleagues to join me in
supporting this historic legislation,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
The Acting CHAIR (Ms. DAVIDS of
Kansas). The time of the Committee on
Ways and Means has expired.
The gentleman from Virginia (Mr.
SCOTT) and the gentlewoman from
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) each will

Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam
Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.
Madam Chair, I would first like to
thank Chairman NEAL, Chairman
PALLONE, the Speaker of the House,
and other Democratic leaders for their
leadership in lowering skyrocketing
drug costs.
The Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug
Costs Now Act is a historic proposal to
improve the health and well-being of
all Americans. Not only does this legis-
lation lower drug costs for taxpayers
and seniors on Medicare, but it also re-
duces drug costs for businesses and
families across the country, allowing
employer-sponsored plans to access the
same cost savings negotiated for Medi-
care.
In fact, according to the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services, H.R. 3
will save households and businesses
more than $160 billion over the next 10
years. In my district, this means sav-
ings for approximately 600,000 people in
public and private health insurance
programs.
H.R. 3 will save the taxpayers hun-
dreds of billions of dollars, and these
savings will be reinvested in healthcare
priorities. These priorities include
funding new cures through the Na-
tional Institutes of Health; funding
community health centers, which serve
29 million Americans across the coun-
try; and combating the opioid epi-
demic.
Simply put, the Elijah E. Cummings
Lower Drug Costs Now Act will lower
prescription drug costs for workers
today while investing in a healthier fu-
ture for all Americans. I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation and
deliver on our bipartisan promise to
lower healthcare costs for the Amer-
ican people.

their medications. That is why Con-
gress started a collaborative and bipar-
tisan process to tackle this issue ear-
lier this year.
In October, this bipartisan collabora-
tion was cut abruptly short by Speaker
PELOSI with the introduction of H.R. 3,
which was written in secret without
Member input or the regular com-
mittee process.
Instead of a bipartisan solution, we
are left with H.R. 3, which is nothing
more than a Democrat downpayment
on a government-run healthcare sys-
tem that would eliminate private in-
surance and implement government-
controlled rationing of prescription
drugs.
I serve as the senior Republican on
the Education and Labor Committee.
H.R. 3 is the latest string in a series of
radical Democratic bills that I have
seen in the committee and in the House
that promote unprecedented govern-
ment interference in private markets
and increased regulatory red tape. Pro-
posals that can and should be bipar-
tisan, such as addressing the skills gap,
pension reform, and now drug pricing,
are being rewritten by Democratic
leadership, which is held hostage by
their most leftwing Members.
An amendment adopted during our
committee markup proves just that
point. Representative PRAMILA
JAYAPAL’s amendment pushes this rad-
ical bill even further to the left by re-
quiring the Secretaries of Labor,
Health and Human Services, and the
Treasury to study and issue regula-
tions on extending government price
controls to private healthcare plans.
The mandate for additional price
controls suggested in this amendment
tells private companies how much they
can increase their prices each year or
forces them to pay a fine. House Demo-
crats aren’t satisfied with only setting
prices in government programs, and
they continue to find ways to expand
the already radical scope of H.R. 3 to
the private market as well.
Since the Education and Labor Com-
mittee markup, this issue has been a
key area of disagreement between mod-
erate and progressive Democrats, but
Speaker PELOSI, yet again, caved to
the demands of her Progressive Caucus
and agreed to keep the amendment in
the final bill.
The flawed and extreme approach
taken by H.R. 3 includes troubling and
unprecedented government inter-
ference in private market negotiations.
Governments don’t negotiate; they dic-
tate. So this radical scheme will elimi-
nate choice and competition and jeop-
ardize innovation, investment, and ac-
cess to future cures.
Breakthrough cures for diseases like
Alzheimer’s, cancer, sickle-cell disease,
and others will be at risk. In fact, if we
pass H.R. 3, the nonpartisan Congres-
sional Budget Office says we could see
up to approximately 38 fewer cures for
deadly diseases over the next 20 years,
and the Council of Economic Advisers
says up to 100 fewer cures over the next
10 years.
If those estimates aren’t concerning
enough, just look at real-world exam-
ples for proof. Countries that have
adopted drug pricing systems like
those included in H.R. 3 face decreased
access to innovative new medicines, in-
creased wait times for treatment, and
supply shortages for in-demand drugs.
Democratic supporters of this bill
have said fewer cures in exchange for
government control prices is ‘‘worth
it.’’ This is shameful. Democrats may
be okay with fewer cures. I am not, and
neither are my colleagues.
The American people deserve better
from Congress. They deserve a real so-
lution that will lower the costs of pre-
scription drugs without jeopardizing
access to new treatments and cures.
That is why House Republicans have
introduced H.R. 19, the Lower Costs,
More Cures Act. This bill contains
measures that have bipartisan support
in the House and the Senate, and it can
become law this year.
Specifically, H.R. 19 will help lower
out-of-pocket costs, protect access to
new medicines and cures, strengthen
transparency and accountability, and
champion competition. Yet, House
Democrats are ignoring this bipartisan,
commonsense legislation. Clearly, they
prefer politics over progress.

which shows that the American people
pay far more for prescription drugs
than any other country in the world by
wide, unacceptable margins. Per cap-
ita, the United States spends 25 percent
more on prescription drugs than Swit-
zerland, the country with the next
highest drug costs.
Specific examples of this outrageous
disparity abound. A vial of insulin in
the U.S. is $300. The same vial in Can-
ada is $32. In the U.S., an EpiPen two-
pack has a list price of $608, in the
U.K., $69.
About one-quarter of Americans say
that it is difficult for them to afford
their prescriptions. Seventy-nine per-
cent of Americans think the costs of
prescription drugs is unreasonable. Ap-
proximately one-third of Americans
say they haven’t taken their medicine
as prescribed because of trouble afford-
ing it.
This week, Congress will vote finally
to use the leverage Medicare has to get
U.S. drug prices in line with the inter-
national price index for developed
countries whose standard of living is
comparable to the U.S. and whose life
expectancy in many cases actually ex-
ceeds the U.S.
As CBO confirmed, this bill will save
patients millions of dollars and will en-
sure that this chart changes for the
better.
Crucially, this bill is unique from
other proposals by lowering drug costs
not just for Medicare but also for the 50
percent of Americans who receive their
health insurance through work.
This bill directs the Secretary of
HHS to negotiate lower drug prices and
extends that price voluntarily to em-
ployer-sponsored health plans, reduc-
ing the relentless increase in
healthcare costs that is driving pre-
miums higher for large employers,
small employers, and the self-insured.
According to the Connecticut Depart-
ment of Insurance, the portion of
healthcare premiums attributable to
prescription drug coverage has in-
creased from 15 percent to 23 percent of
every premium dollar since 2010, which
eats up wages and salaries.
In a nutshell, this bill will put bil-
lions of dollars into the pockets of
working Americans and their families,
at the same time not using a limited
formulary, at the same time preserving
a research and development tax credit,
and at the same time boosting support
for pharmaceutical research at the Na-
tional Institutes of Health.
This bill is the most significant
healthcare proposal in a decade. It is
time for us to listen to the American
people, who in 2018 listed healthcare
costs, specifically prescription drug
care costs, as their number one concern
in exit polls in the highest voter turn-
out for a midterm election since 1914.
This is the bill that responds to that
loud signal from the American people.
I urge passage of H.R. 3.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from South Dakota (Mr. JOHN-
SON).
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.
Madam Chair, I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding.
Americans want lower drug prices. I
want lower drug prices. My colleagues
want lower drug prices.
We have been told tonight that H.R.
3 is the proper vehicle to accomplish
that goal. I regret to inform the body
that it is not. H.R. 3 is not a bipartisan
attempt to find common ground. Make
no mistake about it, it will not become
the law of the land.
But for those of us who came to Con-
gress to solve problems, there is some
good news. There is a better way.
H.R. 19, which was introduced by 111
of my colleagues and me this week, is
markedly better than H.R. 3, and it can
become law. I want to highlight four
components of H.R. 19.
First, it would end abuse of the pat-
ent system, and it would end the pay-
for-delay agreements that allow ge-
neric manufacturers to actually be
paid by their competitors to keep drugs
off the market.
Secondly, it would, for the first time
ever, place a cap on seniors’ out-of-
pocket drug costs. That is supported by
75 percent of Americans.

Third, it would establish a new nego-
tiator within the Office of the United
States Trade Representative, allowing
us to push back against countries that
expect that the U.S. should subsidize
their drug costs.
Finally, it would increase trans-
parency in the doctor’s office and at
the pharmacy. That will be welcome
news for the 90 percent of Americans
who want to see more transparency in
the drug pricing system.
Madam Chair, with agreements this
week on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada
Agreement and the National Defense
Authorization Act, we have some bi-
partisan momentum building in this
town. Oh, my, perhaps it is a Christmas
miracle.
With that in mind, we should set
aside the partisan H.R. 3 and instead
apply that reemerging bipartisan spirit
to lowering drug prices.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam
Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. Davis), the
distinguished member of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor and
chair of the Subcommittee on Higher
Education and Workforce Investment.
Ms. DAVIS of California. Madam
Chair, I thank the gentleman for yield-
ing, and I thank Chairman SCOTT for
his leadership on this bill.
This bill is named after the late Con-
gressman Elijah Cummings for his
great work fighting for affordable
healthcare and prescription drugs.
He fought for people like a con-
stituent of mine who wrote to me re-
garding the absurdly high cost of insu-
lin. He explained in this letter that his
brother had been diagnosed with type 1
diabetes, which requires him to take an
insulin injection four times a day. My
colleagues are probably familiar with
that, people they know. A single bottle
of insulin costs $400. He tells me that
some people skip needles. Others let
themselves stay at harmful blood sugar
levels so that they can make their in-
sulin last longer.
Madam Chair, no one should have to
suffer this indignity, especially when
in many places around the world, insu-
lin is as low as $8.
With H.R. 3, Medicare will be able to
negotiate drug prices for seniors and
beneficiaries, and our constituents
won’t be plagued by such high costs for
such a common drug.
b 2045
And thanks to this bill, the NIH will
have more resources to encourage more
research and more experimentation.
The savings can be used for large
projects and for new pilot initiatives to
assist the development of new cures
and treatments, and this can really be
groundbreaking for all of us.
I supported this bill in committee be-
cause it boosts the economy by saving
both American workers and businesses
billions of dollars. We all know what
that can mean.
Madam Chair, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote for the underlying leg-
islation.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. WRIGHT).
Mr. WRIGHT. Madam Chair, I thank
Ms. FOXX for yielding.
Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to
H.R. 3.
This Congress, we have seen on mul-
tiple occasions that Democrats and Re-
publicans are able to agree on and
move powerful and beneficial legisla-
tion when we put aside politics in favor
of bipartisan pragmatism.
Members on both sides of the aisle
agree that rising drug prices are a
major concern for all Americans, and
you would think we would be able to
deliver for the American people on this
issue.
Unlike the radical bill before us, H.R.
19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act,
contains bipartisan solutions and has a
real chance of being signed into law.
Sadly, we are wasting the taxpayers’
time debating a hapless Federal take-
over of America’s innovative biotech
industry that will result in more harm
than good.
H.R. 3 represents the first step of a
government takeover, all under the
guise of helping. But threatening com-
panies is not helping; restricting future
cures is not helping; threatening the
jobs of 89,000 Texans employed by the
biotech industry is not helping.
This bill would slap manufacturers
with a 95 percent excise tax for not ne-
gotiating its prices with the Federal
Government. That is not negotiating;
that is dictating.
Speaker PELOSI’s price-setting legis-
lation gives manufacturers a stark
choice: comply or exit the U.S. market
entirely.
Doctors take the Hippocratic Oath to
do no harm. Public officials should do
the same.
If one thing is clear to me, it is that
H.R. 3 will absolutely do harm. This
bill has one assured outcome: the sti-
fling of medical innovation here in the
United States.
Experts from the Congressional
Budget Office, the Council of Economic
Advisers, and the California Life
Sciences Association have all warned
of the disastrous impact H.R. 3 will
have on future cures. Specifically, they
warned that up to a third of new cures
could be lost over the next 10 years.
Fortunately, we don’t have to rely
solely on expert estimates about the
impact of government price setting. We
can look at the real-time results in
other countries.
Between 2011 and 2018, 89 percent of
new treatments introduced were avail-
able to Americans, compared to 62 per-
cent in Germany and 60 percent in the
United Kingdom.
We have seen, to the United States’
benefit, the migration of R&D activity
from Europe in the aftermath of their
price controls.
Now is not the time to slow down
medical innovations in the United
States. We must stop this radical gov-
ernment overreach.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam
Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD),
a distinguished member of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor.
Ms. WILD. Madam Chair, I rise in
support of H.R. 3, the Elijah E.
Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.
In his name, the days of putting profits
over people must come to an end.
Madam Chair, to my colleagues
across the aisle, why do they consider
this to be a partisan idea?
Drug companies owe a fiduciary duty
to make profits for their shareholders,
but as Members of Congress, we have a
much more important shareholder: the
American people.
When we try to pass good bills to
drive down drug prices, Big Pharma
throws the weight of its lobby to kill
them. They talk about innovation and
research and development without dis-
closing that they spend more on mar-
keting than they do on innovation,
without disclosing that they could lose
$1 trillion in sales and still be the most
profitable industry.
One vial of insulin in America should
not cost 10 times what it costs in Can-
ada. People like my constituents
Danielle Thrapp and her son Brandon
should not have to worry about the
price of insulin.
People like my constituent Mitchell
Lenett shouldn’t have to worry wheth-
er his 14-year-old daughter Carly, who
has type 1 diabetes, will be able to af-
ford her insulin when she is no longer
on his health insurance plan. That is
why this bill is so important.
The Secretary of HHS must be able
to negotiate lower drug prices for the
highest cost prescription drugs, some-
thing other countries with far lower
drug prices have long been able to do.
The Congressional Budget Office tells
us that H.R. 3 will lower prices and in-
crease the availability of prescription
drugs. The CBO score says that this
bill will reduce Federal spending for
Medicare by at least $345 billion.
This will free up funding for some of
our other priorities, like my bill to in-
crease funding for child abuse preven-
tion and treatment services and for ex-
panding trauma-informed education
practices in our schools and for mental
health services.
Madam Chair, I call on my colleagues
to put people over profits, finally, and
pass this bill.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG).
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
Madam Chair, as I travel across
Michigan, I constantly hear about the
high cost of prescription drugs. Hard-
working families are simply paying too
much.
We agree on this, and that is why we
need to tackle this issue in a bipartisan
way, not try to score political points
like, Madam Chair, I am hearing to-
night.
Sadly, H.R. 3 is a partisan, heavy-
handed approach that has no chance of
becoming law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10115
December 11, 2019
Mr. Chair, let’s be honest: Govern-
ments don’t negotiate; they dictate.
This drug-pricing scheme will ulti-
mately hurt families, stifle innovation,
and prevent lifesaving cures from be-
coming available to our friends, our
neighbors, our families.
Approximately 100 lifesaving drugs,
according to the Council of Economic
Advisers, won’t come to fruition if H.R.
3 passes.
Mr. Chair, I would dearly love to ask
my colleagues: Which of those cures
would we do away with? Alzheimer’s?
Parkinson’s disease? Childhood can-
cers? Which ones would we give up for
H.R. 3?
There is a better approach, a plan
that is patient-focused and filled with
bipartisan provisions that enjoys sup-
port in the Senate, and, oh, by the way,
the President would sign. It would be-
come law. It would reduce the costs
and increase innovation. It is H.R. 19,
the Lower Costs, More Cures Act.
Mr. Chair, this bill will strengthen
transparency, encourage medical
breakthroughs, and make medications
that families rely on more affordable.
If the other side is serious, Mr. Chair,
about getting something done, then we
should be voting on the Lower Costs,
More Cures Act this week and move it
forward for our people and provide
cures at lower cost—and many more
than the other countries that you are
talking about tonight.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Washington (Ms. SCHRIER), a dis-
tinguished member of the Committee
on Education and Labor, who, prior to
her service in Congress, was a prac-
ticing physician.
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Chair, I thank ev-
eryone who worked so hard on the Eli-
jah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs
Now Act.
As so many of my colleagues have
said already, this is a groundbreaking
bill.
Medicare is the biggest purchaser of
medications in the world, and it should
absolutely have the power to negotiate
costs, and we should not continue to
pay three to four times more than the
rest of the world for our medications.
With negotiation, this bill saves hun-
dreds of billions of dollars, and we are
going to use that money well. Part is
for research, but one of the ways is my
bill, included in H.R. 3, that requires
Medicare to cover vision care.
Medicare part B covers cataract sur-
gery and yearly glaucoma tests, but it
does not cover routine eye exams,
glasses, or contact lenses, and this is a
tremendous gap in coverage for our
seniors.
We want to make sure seniors can
live independently for as long as pos-
sible, and part of this is making sure
they can see well enough to drive to
appointments, walk safely around the
house, and carefully read their pre-
scription bottles. Also, poor vision can
limit physical activity and increase
isolation, leading then to deteriorating
health.
As a doctor, I am concerned about
the number of older Americans who
have not had an eye exam in well over
a year and might have undiagnosed eye
conditions. By expanding Medicare
part B to cover vision care, we will en-
sure that older Americans will be able
to access affordable care.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KEL-
LER).
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Chair, I thank Ms.
FOXX for yielding me time.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
join me in opposing H.R. 3.
While we can all agree that Ameri-
cans pay too much for healthcare and
that the rising cost of prescription
medicine needs to be addressed, H.R. 3
is not the bill to accomplish those
goals.
Traveling across Pennsylvania’s 12th
Congressional District, I have met with
patients and medical professionals who
have told me that the best way to ad-
dress rising prescription drug costs in-
clude patient reforms that will include
patent reform to get generics to mar-
ket faster, price transparency so con-
sumers know the actual cost of the
medication they are purchasing, and
incentivizing innovation to help find
new cures.
Contrary to these goals, H.R. 3 would
turn a blind eye to good bipartisan
work done on this issue throughout
2019 that can provide real savings for
our seniors and our families.
H.R. 3 would lead to more govern-
ment control over a private industry,
putting this country on the road to so-
cialized medicine. And H.R. 3 would
lead to fewer cures, with some esti-
mates saying up to 100 fewer cures
would be found as a result of this legis-
lation.
Mr. Chair, we have a bipartisan plan
that has the support of doctors and pa-
tients alike. H.R. 19 would provide for
more cures, create price transparency,
and get generics to market faster.
These are bipartisan solutions
backed by doctors and pharmacists in
Pennsylvania’s 12th Congressional Dis-
trict, in the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania, and across our country.
While Americans struggle to pay for
the high cost of prescription drugs, we
have real legislation that can help
solve this real problem. We should not
be wasting our time debating some-
thing that harms Americans by pro-
viding fewer cures and will never be-
come law.
Mr. Chair, again, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this socialist fantasy
in H.R. 3 and encourage us to work on
the real bipartisan solutions in H.R. 19.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Connecticut (Mrs. HAYES), a dis-
tinguished member of the Committee
on Education and Labor and a former
National Teacher of the Year.
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Chairman, I rise in
support of the Elijah E. Cummings
Lower Drug Costs Now Act, a bill that
would take power wielded and
weaponized by massive drug companies
and put it back in the hands of the
American people.
It is beyond unacceptable that fami-
lies in my district and around the
country are price gouged at the phar-
macy counter and forced to make the
impossible decision to either pay for
their medication or put food on their
table.
H.R. 3 will save my constituents in
Connecticut’s Fifth suffering from dis-
eases like diabetes, asthma, and arthri-
tis, hundreds—even thousands—of dol-
lars per year.
b 2100
But perhaps the thing I am most
proud of in H.R. 3 is that it includes a
bill that I sponsored, the Supporting
Trauma-Informed Education Practices
Act. This bill will put drug companies
who share responsibility for the opioid
crisis on the hook for part of the solu-
tion.
My bill would direct $100 million of
the savings from drug pricing negotia-
tions to grants that would improve
trauma support services and mental
healthcare for children and schools.
As a Member of Congress who has
spent a career in the classroom, I have
seen the painful reality of too many
schools having too few counselors and
psychologists to tackle the complex
needs of students suffering from abuse,
neglect, and trauma.
We need to commit to investing and
implementing ongoing supports and
wraparound services for every student
who is affected, for every student who
has faced loss or has been separated
from their parents as a result of the
opioid crisis.
Drug companies are prioritizing prof-
its over human lives in their cruel
business calculus. Communities like
Waterbury, Litchfield, and New Britain
in my district desperately need help to
fight this opioid crisis, which mirrors
the crisis that consumers are currently
facing with rising drug costs.
I am proud that this bill also in-
cludes legislation I cosponsored that
would lower drug costs for some of the
most vulnerable members of the popu-
lation.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. LEVIN of
California). The time of the gentle-
woman has expired.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I
yield the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut an additional 30 seconds.
Mrs. HAYES. The bill would also
save older adults with limited incomes
money and improve access to their
needed medications.
Mr. Chairman, my constituents can-
not wait for change. Patients in rural
communities cannot wait for change.
The 22,000 Connecticut residents diag-
nosed with cancer each year cannot
wait for change. The student in Meri-
den who has suffered as a victim of the
opioid crisis cannot wait for change.
I urge my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle to recognize that our con-
stituents need us. I urge my colleagues
to vote in support of H.R. 3.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H10116 December 11, 2019
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr.
GROTHMAN).
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I also
rise to speak against H.R. 3.
To me, there are two segments of so-
ciety in which the costs have gone out
of control and are really broken. One is
the secondary education system, and
the other is the medical situation.
It is not surprising that the two
areas that prices have spun out of con-
trol since I was a child are two areas in
which the government has been most
involved; and, therefore, we should be
very measured before we become in-
volved in a lot more government pre-
scription or mucking around the med-
ical industry.
And I say that as somebody who is no
friend of the drug companies. I think
their behavior has become absolutely
deplorable.
Nevertheless, we have to remember
that, when it comes to new drugs right
now on the market, other countries
have a lot less access than we do in
America. In that regard, America is
still number one.
Only 36 percent of the new drugs are
allowed into Australia, 46 percent in
Canada, and under 60 percent in the
U.K. We are still the envy of people in
other parts of the world there.
Of new cancer drugs launched in the
last 8 years, 95 percent are available in
the United States, 74 percent in the
U.K., and less than 50 percent in Japan.
The thing to remember which is so
frequently true: Government involve-
ment can be good, but a lot of times
government involvement can make
things worse.
The next frustrating thing about this
bill is there are good things that both
sides could agree on and could pass
right away.
We have heard a lot about H.R. 19
right now. One of their folks was talk-
ing about the high cost of insulin. We
are doing things, or people would do
things in H.R. 19, to rush more
biosimilars to insulin to the market.
They could have that victory tomor-
row.
But, for some reason, rather than
vote on a bill they know will pass and
will do a great deal to reduce the cost
of prescription drugs, the other side
has elected to bring forth a bill that
they know will not pass, which comes
down to the third point I am going to
make: Why are they not passing a bill
that would collect the vast majority of
Republicans in the House and has a
good chance of passing the Senate and
being signed by President Trump?
I reluctantly conclude that, one more
time, they don’t want to have a victory
in these 2 years, for whatever motiva-
tion. And that is truly sad because
these drug costs are out of control, and
there are victories that can be taken
today.
But instead of passing a bill, given
political reality, that can be brought
to the floor, they will pass a bill on the
House floor that they know is going to
go nowhere in the Senate and that they
know is going to delay the relief that
people need.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman has expired.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I yield the gentleman from
Wisconsin an additional 30 seconds.
Mr. GROTHMAN. They know it will
delay that relief for at least another
year.
I have a bill I am going to talk about,
myself, a little bit later.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chair, I just want to comment
about a letter that we received from
the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees. This
letter states, in part: ‘‘Enactment of
H.R. 3 is needed because:
‘‘It directs our government to stand
on the side of all Americans and pro-
tect us from price gouging by directly
negotiating for lower prescription drug
prices.
‘‘It creates a new $2,000 out-of-pocket
limit on prescription drugs for people
on Medicare.
‘‘It reinvests Federal savings into
much-needed new Medicare benefits to
cover dental, vision, and hearing.
‘‘The cost of inaction is too high. It
is calculated in the suffering of individ-
uals who are forced to ration their
medicines or choose between buying
medicines or paying for housing and
groceries. Prescription drug companies
must be made accountable. We urge
you to send a clear message that Con-
gress is on the side of all Americans by
directing the government to directly
negotiate for lower prescription drug
prices. Please vote in support of H.R.
3.’’
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs.
MILLER).
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today to oppose H.R. 3.
Every single person in our country
deserves lower prescription drug prices.
Congress needs to act. But the bill on
the floor today is not the answer.
With this legislation, my colleagues
across the aisle have decided that, once
again, government should be in the
business of healthcare, picking winners
and losers, taxing lifesaving cures, and
ignoring that private innovation is the
main driver in advancing healthcare.
House Republicans have a bipartisan
solution, one which will deliver the
transparency, affordability, and pre-
dictability we need: H.R. 19, the Lower
Costs, More Cures Act.
With this bill, we can make sure that
every person—the parents of a newborn
baby, a young adult with a chronic ill-
ness, a coal miner coping with black
lung disease, or a senior citizen taking
their daily pills—has access to the
drugs they need at the affordable, pre-
dictable prices they deserve.
We need the innovators to be at the
forefront of creating new, better drugs
to improve quality of life for all Ameri-
cans in need. H.R. 19 delivers this. We
can have it all. That is why I oppose
H.R. 3.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Chair, I want to comment on a
letter we received from the AFL–CIO, a
legislative alert. It says, in part, that
‘‘3 in 10 adults report that they were
unable to take their medicines as pre-
scribed at some point in the past year
because of the cost, often worsening
their medical condition, according to
the Kaiser Family Foundation. Yet ac-
cording to AARP, the average annual
cost of prescription drugs rose nearly
58 percent between 2012 and 2017. Prices
in 2019 increased for 3,400 drugs on the
market, with an average price increase
of 10.5 percent, a rate roughly five
times the inflation rate. . . . ‘’
‘‘The Lower Drug Prices Now Act
takes bold action to address this re-
lentless rise in drug prices. . . . ‘’
‘‘H.R. 3 reinvests the estimated $500
billion in Federal savings in historic
improvements to Medicare benefits and
other important healthcare programs.
Medicare part D prescription drug cov-
erage is substantially improved by the
addition of a $2,000 out-of-pocket max-
imum. Medicare benefits are further
expanded by the inclusion of vision,
dental, and hearing benefits. To help
low-income seniors, the legislation ex-
pands subsidy eligibility to make pre-
miums and out-of-pocket costs more
affordable.
‘‘Other investments in healthcare in-
clude $7.7 billion to support community
responses to the opioid crisis and $10
billion for National Institutes of
Health biomedical research toward the
discovery of breakthrough drug thera-
pies.
‘‘The Lower Drug Prices Now Act
will provide crucial assistance to work-
ing families who are currently unable
to afford the medicines they need,
while simultaneously making impor-
tant investments to address other
healthcare priorities. We urge you to

Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr. MUR-
PHY).
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I rise tonight in opposition
to H.R. 3.
As a practicing surgeon for the last
30 years, I believe I give somewhat of a
unique perspective on the unbearable
high price of prescription drugs, an
issue that all Americans can agree
upon.
I have seen patients and continue to
see patients who simply cannot afford
their medications. We all agree on this
problem. Unfortunately, however, H.R.
3 is, while well intentioned, a poorly
executed solution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10117
December 11, 2019
Healthcare economics are unique, a
fact that many here do not realize.
Price controls do not work in
healthcare. There is evidence to show
that, in countries that implement price
controls, only a fraction of medicines
that come to market are actually
available.
I should know. I have worked across
the globe. I have worked in places
where I have tried to prescribe medica-
tions that I thought were best for pa-
tients, only to have government pre-
vent me from doing so.
In Australia, for example, only 36
percent of new drugs released between
2011 and 2018 were available. Canada
and the United Kingdom hardly fared
better with 46 and 59 percent.
The American public does not de-
serve to be shortchanged.
In my 30 years as a practicing sur-
geon, I have seen new drugs and treat-
ments become available that 20, 10, and
even 5 years ago patients could have
only dreamed of. But curative thera-
pies do not occur overnight. They
occur by innovative and dedicated sci-
entists who continue to be on the cut-
ting edge of research and development.
Yet it takes financial risks to de-
velop these drugs. At present, less than
1 in 100 drugs that are being discovered
actually ever come to market.
H.R. 3 will gut companies with a 95
percent tax if they do not succumb to
the government’s strong-arm negotia-
tion.
As a urologist, I can personally at-
test to the leaps and bounds that have
been made in drugs that treat advanced
prostate cancer. In just the last 5
years, more progress has been made in
metastatic prostate cancer than in the
preceding 70 years. I can now talk to
patients about outliving their cancers
rather than succumbing to them.
We can control drug costs. H.R. 19,
the Lower Costs, More Cures Act, is a
much better path. We should cut the
billions spent on direct-to-consumer
advertising or the billions spent on
pharmacy benefit managers. We need a
surgical approach to cure this disease,
not a heavy-handed hatchet job by an
overreaching government.
H.R. 19 leads to decreased costs
while, at the same time, providing a
pathway for the cures that so many pa-
tients desperately seek.
b 2115
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
I will point out that the question of
availability of drugs in the United
States came up at a hearing we had on
this legislation. It was pointed out that
the target negotiated price will be ap-
proximately 120 percent of the inter-
national average. That is a lot better
than the two, three, five, as much as 60
times higher Americans are paying for
the same drugs here than in other
countries.
At that price, at 120 percent, that
will be the highest price, and we will be
the biggest market. They certainly
won’t take a drug away from the big-
gest market paying the highest price,
so we don’t have to worry about avail-
ability.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I yield myself such time as
I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, House Democrats
have once again decided to pursue poli-
tics over progress and advance a rad-
ical drug pricing scheme that will
eliminate choice and competition, and
jeopardize innovation, investment, and
access to future cures, putting break-
through treatments for diseases like
Alzheimer’s, cancer, sickle-cell, and
others at risk.
As many as 100 lifesaving drugs—and
that needs to be repeated, Mr. Chair-
man, as many as 100 lifesaving drugs—
could be kept from Americans des-
perately in need because of Speaker
PELOSI’s socialist drug-pricing scheme.
This is unacceptable.
We shouldn’t be pursuing policies
that will harm the health and well-
being of American patients, and we
shouldn’t destroy a system that allows
the U.S. to lead the world in new cures
and treatments.
Bottom line, this radical legislation
offers fewer cures, and American fami-
lies will suffer because of it.
I strongly urge my colleagues to vote
‘‘no’’ on this seriously flawed bill, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Chair, last year, Congress made a
promise to lower skyrocketing drug
costs and strengthen our healthcare
system for Americans. H.R. 3, the Eli-
jah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs
Now Act, delivers on that promise. The
legislation not only lowers the costs of
prescription drugs for taxpayers and
those enrolled in Medicare, but it also
lowers the costs for workers, busi-
nesses, and families.
It improves the quality of healthcare
by expanding Medicare benefits to in-
clude vision, dental, and hearing bene-
fits, and it limits the out-of-pocket
copays and deductibles to $2,000.
It strengthens public health by in-
vesting in community health centers,
and it provides historic funding for evi-
dence-based student trauma services
and the Child Abuse Prevention and
Treatment Act. Both of these initia-
tives will help support children who
have suffered abuse or trauma related
to substance use disorder and the
opioid crisis.
The Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug
Costs Now Act is a long-overdue step to
improve healthcare and the lives of
Americans across the country, both
today and for decades to come.
Again, I thank Chairman PALLONE,
Chairman NEAL, Speaker PELOSI, and
other Democratic leaders for bringing
this legislation to the floor, and I urge
all of my colleagues to support this pri-
ority for the American people.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
Committee on Education and Labor
has expired.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I move that the Committee do
now rise.
The motion was agreed to.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mrs.
HAYES) having assumed the chair, Mr.
LEVIN of California, Acting Chair of the
Committee of the Whole House on the
state of the Union, reported that that
Committee, having had under consider-
ation the bill (H.R. 3) to establish a fair
price negotiation program, protect the
Medicare program from excessive price
increases, and establish an out-of-pock-
et maximum for Medicare part D en-
rollees, and for other purposes, had
come to no resolution thereon.

PRESCRIPTION DRUG POLITICS

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that
all Members have 5 legislative days in
which to revise and extend their re-

on the topic of this Special Order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia?
There was no objection.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I am thankful to have this op-
portunity tonight.
Obviously, the subject matter that
we have been discussing here, prescrip-
tion drug prices, is something that is
very important to all Americans, and I
am very happy that we are finally get-
ting around to this.
Madam Speaker, as a practicing
pharmacist for most of my career, I
take the issue of drug pricing very per-
sonally. In fact, it is one of the pri-
mary reasons that I wanted to come to
Congress, to do something about it.
I had the honor and privilege of prac-
ticing pharmacy for over 30 years. I
was the one at the front counter who
had to tell the patient how much the
medication was.
I was the one who witnessed the
mother in tears because she couldn’t
afford the medication for her child.
I was the one who witnessed the sen-
ior citizens trying to make decisions

between whether they were going to
buy their medications or buy their gro-
ceries.
I was the one on the other side of the
counter. I committed myself to do
something about that once I became a
Member of Congress, and I am glad to
see that we are finally doing that.
I want to preface my remarks by say-
ing this: I truly believe that those on
the other side of the aisle and we on
this side of the aisle want the same
thing. I truly believe that. I truly be-
lieve that we all want to lower pre-
scription drug prices, and I truly be-
lieve that we can do just that. I truly
believe that we need to do just that.
However, there are some differences
here. Those experiences that I had on
the other side of the counter have driv-
en me to work hard on bipartisan solu-
tions to lower drug costs for patients
since coming to Congress, but particu-
larly during this last year. However, it
seems that every time I get my hopes
up that we will work together to pass
meaningful policies to help the Amer-
ican people afford their medications,
the Democrats have put politics over
progress.
In the spring, I was proud to work
with my friend Congressman
SCHRADER, in a bipartisan way, on the
BLOCKING Act to increase generic
competition in the marketplace.
Again, both of us wanted the same
thing. We worked on this together, in a
bipartisan fashion.
But what happened? Speaker PELOSI
paired our bipartisan drug pricing bill
up on the floor with political poison
pills. Politics over progress.
This summer, I worked with Con-
gresswoman SCHAKOWSKY to strike a
deal to pass a comprehensive drug
transparency bill, the METRIC Act.
Unanimously, it passed out of com-
mittee. Republicans and Democrats
voted for it.
But what happened? Different
versions of these policies we had struck
a bipartisan agreement on were added
to the Speaker’s bill before us today.
Politics over progress.
This fall, Energy and Commerce
Committee Republicans were close to
striking a bipartisan deal with our
friends across the aisle to cap out-of-
pocket spending for seniors on Medi-
care.
What happened? Our Democratic col-
leagues walked away from those bipar-
tisan negotiations to double down on a
partisan bill that we know is dead on
arrival in the Senate. Politics over
progress.
This holiday season, Energy and
Commerce Committee Republicans in-
troduced a bill, H.R. 19, the Lower
Costs, More Cures Act, to make one
last, earnest effort to pass good, bipar-
tisan drug spending policies that could
be signed into law this year and imme-
diately help patients—immediate help
for patients.
My hope is that we can come to-
gether because, as I said before, we all
want the same thing. We all need the
same thing. My hope is that we can
come together and support the Walden
amendment and pass the bipartisan
Lower Costs, More Cures Act instead of
this deeply partisan H.R. 3.
My hope is that my Democratic col-
leagues stop putting politics over
progress and join us to pass bipartisan
drug pricing reforms that actually can
be signed into law and will help pa-
tients.
Madam Speaker, we have a number of
people here today who want to speak
on this. I know that I am going to have
some personal stories that I want to
share, and I think some of my col-
leagues are going to have some per-
sonal stories as well, real-life situa-
tions, real people, real problems, real
diseases. This is what we are talking
about here.
There is no reason in the world that
this should be a partisan issue. Never,
in my over 30 years of practicing phar-
macy, did I ever go to the counter and
say: Okay, are you a Republican or are
you a Democrat? No, never did that
happen, and it should not happen. And
it should not happen in the Halls of
Congress, either. There is no excuse, no
reason, that should ever happen.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE),
a gentleman on the Energy and Com-
merce Committee.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring
attention to the consequences of the
drug pricing bill H.R. 3.
There is no doubt we must act to
lower prescription drug prices for
Americans and for Americans to pay
only their fair share. However, this bill
is not the right path.
We often hear stories about the way
other countries pay for their drugs and
other country payment systems. What
you don’t often hear are stories about
patients who are unable to receive care
and access to lifesaving drugs because
of the limitations in their country.
For Louise Moorhouse, we have ex-
amples of how much less is offered in
these other countries, but it is per-
sonal. For example, Louise Moorhouse
is a teacher in England. Hope was with-
in reach when she enrolled in a trial for
Kuvan, a drug used to treat PKU, a
rare genetic metabolic disorder. If left
untreated, the disease can result in
mild to severe neurological issues.
When Louise was in the clinical trial
for Kuvan, she was able to eat and
function like anyone else. Sadly, Lou-
ise discovered after the trial that the
drug that helped her live a more nor-
mal life was not covered by the United
Kingdom’s National Health Service.
Despite the agency’s acknowledg-
ment of the drug’s efficacy, as the drug
is not covered by the NHS, she no
longer has access to this drug. Instead,
she has returned to taking 80 pills a
day, in conjunction with a highly re-
strictive diet.
b 2130
In the United States, we have access
to innovative drugs. The keyword is
‘‘access.’’
When people talk about H.R. 3, what
they want to say is that we can com-
pletely transform the way we pay for
drugs and never talk about or never
even acknowledge the way we com-
pletely transform the way we receive
and have access to drugs. We know
that from the Congressional Budget Of-
fice.
There are other studies that say we
can lose 100 different cures that are
coming down the path. So, as Ameri-
cans want relief from prescription drug
prices, Americans also want access to
these innovative drugs.
President Carter is alive today be-
cause of access to one of his experi-
mental drugs that are becoming lower
cost and more affordable for everyone.
My point is there doesn’t have to be
a choice. We can have both. We can
have lower prices and not completely
lose access to these drugs and continue
the great innovation that we have.
That choice is H.R. 19. It is a bill that
will be on the floor tomorrow. Every
bit of it is bipartisan. Every single
piece of it has a Republican and a Dem-
ocrat cosponsor. It is something we
know the Senate will take up and the
President will sign and give relief to
the American people and continue to
give access to the great innovations
that we have.
Madam Speaker, I hope that we can
take that bill up tomorrow, and I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentleman espe-
cially for making the point that is
true: We can have both. We can lower
drug costs; we can continue with inno-
vation; and we do not have to stymie
innovation. We can achieve what both
sides want to achieve without sty-
mieing innovation and without cutting
out research and development.
Madam Speaker, I want to bring up
another situation in which modern
medicine has played a role. I will give
you an example of where research and
development has resulted in miracle
cures.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an-
other terrible disease that predomi-
nantly impacts males and is a result of
a genetic mutation that inhibits the
body from producing the chemical
needed to make your muscles work.
As with the other diseases that we
are going to mention tonight, it has a
significant impact on those who are af-
fected. But, fortunately, we have a
drug to treat it.
Exondys is a drug developed to treat
a particular group of people suffering
from Duchenne, and it was the first
treatment of its kind approved by the
FDA. That means that these people for
whom this was developed would be able
to have their bodies develop the pro-
tein necessary to stimulate muscle de-
velopment and activity. In other
words, it can help to improve the daily

lives of these people with that par-
ticular type of muscular dystrophy.
Once again, I can’t stress how much
of an impact these incredible cures
that I have witnessed during my life-
time have. During my professional
practice, I have seen nothing short of
miracles of people being able to get
their lives back and being able to ex-
tend their lives and live a healthy life.
This therapy that we are talking
about right here, Exondys, is not avail-
able in any other country if you needed
it. You have to come to the United
States, Madam Speaker. That is the
only place that it is available. It is not
available in these other countries.
The gentleman from Kentucky just
mentioned about all these medications
that aren’t available in other coun-
tries. This is an example of one that we
are talking about right here. Our focus
has to continue to be on the cutting
edge of drug development.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Washington (Mrs. ROD-
GERS), who is my good friend and a val-
uable member of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee. Representative ROD-
GERS brings an outstanding portfolio of
experience, and we appreciate her very
much.
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington.
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and
colleague from Georgia, Representative
BUDDY CARTER, very much for bringing
us all together.
Many of us are members of the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee. We are
on the forefront, and we are committed
to making sure that lifesaving drugs
and treatments are more affordable. It
is a top priority, and I appreciate the
gentleman’s leadership as a pharmacist
on the front lines of so many of these
lifesaving and life-changing treat-
ments.
We hear it every day from seniors,
people with disabilities, and patients
that they are anxious for results. The
good news is that we are leading. The
Trump administration has led on this
front to deliver. The FDA is breaking
records for the amount of generic drugs
that are being approved right now.
That is the key to bringing down the
costs of prescription drugs.
I am also so proud of the bipartisan
work that we did in the Energy and
Commerce Committee 3 years ago to
get the 21st Century Cures legislation
signed into law. Thanks to 21st Cen-
tury Cures, we are continuing to lead.
America has led for 70 to 80 years. Be-
cause of this legislation, we will con-
tinue to lead.
However, that is all threatened with
H.R. 3. It means fewer cures.
I think about my dad. He has diabe-
tes. My mom struggles with heart
issues. My grandma had dementia, and
my son was born with an extra 21st
chromosome, Down syndrome. Because
research has given my son an oppor-
tunity to live and to reach his full po-
tential, his life expectancy is today
longer than ever.
Let’s keep moving forward. H.R. 19,
the Lower Costs, More Cures Act, helps
us move forward. It includes bipartisan
solutions that President Trump can
sign into law this year.
We should be building upon the work
that we did with 21st Century Cures.
We want to see more generic drugs
come to the market faster and finally
make insulin more affordable for our
seniors, lower out-of-pocket spending,
cap the doughnut hole, access new
medicines and cures, and require price
transparency. Every single provision is
bipartisan.
Unfortunately, the Speaker and the
Democrats are moving forward in a
partisan exercise directing the Federal
Government to set drug prices, and it
will stop innovation. America will fall
behind as the global leader, and we can
see what impact that has all over the
world: hundreds and hundreds of fewer
drugs entering the market.
I want to stand on the side of innova-
tion and more breakthroughs helping
millions of people with the ravages of
disease that they encounter every day.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for his tremendous leadership
on this issue.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I guarantee you that every
person who has the honor and privilege
of serving in this august body has a
story just like that and knows someone
or has a family member who has been
impacted by a disease and whose qual-
ity of life has been improved by the
fact that we have had medications
available—everyone in this Chamber,
everyone who has the honor and privi-
lege of serving in this Chamber.
Again, as I have said all along, we all
want the same thing. We all need the
same thing. As Representative GUTHRIE
said earlier, we can have the same
thing without stopping innovation and
without stopping research and develop-
ment.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. BROOKS),
who is another invaluable member of
the Energy and Commerce Committee.
Representative BROOKS is a gentle-
woman who brings, again, an out-
standing portfolio of experience, and
we appreciate her very much.
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to thank my col-
league, the only pharmacist in the
House, BUDDY CARTER from the great
State of Georgia, who has brought us
together to talk about the importance
of lowering costs and making sure we
can continue to focus on more cures.
I also rise today in opposition to H.R.
3. We know that Americans pay far too
much for the drugs at the pharmacy
counter, something that my colleague
knows better than anybody, and it is
our duty to come together to find solu-
tions that are solutions to lower costs
of drugs while protecting innovation
and future drug development in our
country.
But, unfortunately, H.R. 3, which we
are scheduled to vote on tomorrow,
jeopardizes that American innovation
and patient access to care. The non-
partisan CBO estimates that, under
H.R. 3, approximately 15 fewer drugs
will be introduced over the next dec-
ade, and about 30 fewer drugs over the
following decade, and then a 10 percent
reduction annually, afterwards, into
perpetuity. This means that over 40 po-
tential cures will not be discovered
over the next 20 to 30 years.
So let’s talk about what that means.
It might mean there might not be a
cure for breast cancer, maybe no cure
for diabetes and no cure for Alz-
heimer’s, diseases that we know impact
Americans all across our country.
We lead the world in innovation, in
breakthrough medicines, cutting-edge
technologies, and therapies to save and
improve lives. Our peer nations have 40
to 60 percent fewer cures—as you just
heard from previous speakers—com-
pared to what is available in our mar-
ket.
In Canada, a country with a national-
ized health system, Tori Lacey, a 21-
year-old with SMA type 2, spinal mus-
cular atrophy, is unable to access a
treatment called Spinraza because it is
not covered for those with type 2 SMA
in Ontario.
Stringent eligibility criteria for
novel medicines prevent Tori, a college
student, from focusing on her school-
work and future. So Tori must suffer
through this genetic neuromuscular
disorder that affects the nerve cells
that control voluntary muscles instead
of being granted access to this critical
drug. In America, Tori would be able to
access this cure.
If we lose these 15 drugs over the
next decade, again, which drug and
which disease is going to lose out? Is it
breast cancer, a disease that claims
one in eight women each year?
Madam Speaker, do I go home and
tell my dear, longtime friend Judy,
who, at one time, was told she had 18
months to live—that was 8 years ago—
do I tell her: Sorry, we may not be able
to work on it, and the drug companies
that do this R&D may not be able to
because we can’t get our act together
to protect innovation?
Judy has been fighting, for the sec-
ond time, breast cancer for 8 years. She
has been holding on to hope that next
month there may be a cure and that
next year there may be a cure. But
under H.R. 3, those chances drop pre-
cipitously.
If we lose 15 drugs over the next dec-
ade, will it be diabetes, a disease af-
fecting over 30 million Americans, a
disease gripping 700,000 of my fellow
Hoosiers?
This past summer, I visited with a
young JDRF advocate, Ella, from Indi-
anapolis. Ella was diagnosed with type
1 diabetes at age 4. She is an incredible
young girl who is advocating on behalf
of kids like her with diabetes. She
came to Washington and shared her
story with me.
She is a gymnast, but with her dis-
ease, she has to be incredibly careful
and monitor her blood sugar con-
stantly. She told me sometimes she has

to sit out at practice due to her blood
sugar and that it is very annoying to
this 11-year-old gymnast. She should be
focused on her gymnastics and on
school, but instead of being a kid, she
has to worry about her blood sugar and
about her insuline pump.
I hear from constituents like Ella
and her family that the technology de-
velopments in the diabetes space is
working to make lives almost normal.
Diabetes was a death sentence just
over 100 years ago. Now, diabetics can
almost live normal lives.
But what if we could find a cure?
Hopefully one day, advancements in
medicine technology will allow Ella to
be that kid, a kid without any worry.
If we lose these 15 drugs over the
next decade, is it the GNAO1
encephalopathy? It is a rare neuro-
logical disorder that causes develop-
mental delays, early infantile seizures,
and abnormal movements.
My dear friend and a former House
staffer here on the Hill, Emily, had to
leave my team when she found out that
her first child, sweet Madeline, was di-
agnosed with this rare disease. Mad-
eline is now 5 years old.
Madeline, at this point in her life,
will never be able to feed herself. She
will never be able to run around with
classmates. She will never experience a
normal childhood without a cure, let
alone more answers to this very rare
disease.
We could go on and on and on if we
lose 15 drugs over the next decade.
H.R. 3 is so wrong for America. But
we have an alternative.
We came together with H.R. 19, the
Lower Costs, More Cures Act, of which
I am proud to be an original cosponsor.
This is a piece of legislation that is a
bipartisan package, what BUDDY
CARTER was talking about. It is focused
on lowering drug prices while pro-
tecting America’s ability to lead the
world in innovative solutions.
Our Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee enjoys an, actually, very warm
and bipartisan working relationship on
so many bills. We worked across the
aisle; we held many hearings; we had
many markups; and we worked on
thorny issues together. Our committee
actually put forward several serious bi-
partisan measures that could become
law. They are part of H.R. 19.
I am not going to go through all of
those pieces that are in H.R. 19, but one
of the things that is so important
about H.R. 19 is it provides afford-
ability and predicability for patients
and seniors.
Americans don’t want a guessing
game at the pharmacy counter. H.R. 19
caps out-of-pocket costs for seniors; it
increases competition, which is key to
getting more generic medicines to the
market; it increases low-cost options
for patients by bringing these generics
to the marketplace faster; it ends pay-
for-delay; it implements CREATES;
and it eases new product entry to the
market.
I could go on and on.
b 2145
These were things that we worked on
with our colleagues across the aisle,
and that is what is in H.R. 19.
So while H.R. 3 crushes investments
in the R&D of new cures, it stifles in-
novation and uses incredibly harsh
penalties to squeeze drug manufactur-
ers who create these cures. It squeezes
them almost out of existence in many
ways.
Ultimately, it is the patients who
suffer, and it is H.R. 19 that will en-
courage innovation of those cures and
protect access to new medicines. It will
support competition, which will drive
down prices and lower the cost of medi-
cines, and it does put patients first.
So I urge my colleagues to support
that innovation by opposing H.R. 3 and
supporting the bipartisan H.R. 19,
Lower Costs, More Cures Act—real so-
lutions for Americans.
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league for hosting this important hour.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, just one important point to
the gentlewoman, really quick: You are
right, whether you believe the CBO
who says that H.R. 3 will result in 8 to
15 drugs not coming to market, or
whether you believe the Council of
Economic Advisers, who says over 100
drugs won’t come to market, even if it
is just one drug, that is one too many.
And I thank the gentlewoman.
Madam Speaker, I recognize one of
the members of our Doctors Caucus.
We are very blessed in this Congress to
have a number of fine physicians.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Kansas, (Mr. MARSHALL).
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker, I
thank Congressman CARTER for his
leadership as a community pharmacist.
You and I have worked together in
different cities but on the same
projects trying to help patients out.
And here we are gathered in Congress
now for this same purpose.
I thought I might talk about Alz-
heimer’s disease for a little bit this
evening.
It is hard to imagine that over 5 mil-
lion Americans have Alzheimer’s dis-
ease. And I bet there is not a person in
this room, a person at home watching,
that doesn’t have a loved one that they
have watched them suffer and go
through the stages of Alzheimer’s dis-
ease—5 million Americans. And it is
hard to imagine, in three decades we
are going to have 14 million Americans
with Alzheimer’s.
For the sake of humanity, we need a
drug to cure this. And you and I both
know that we are truly this close, that
there are medications in the pipeline
that are going to help treat Alz-
heimer’s.
The economic impact of this disease
on our country is also extraordinary.
Right now, we are spending about $300
billion a year treating Alzheimer’s pa-
tients. Again, in three decades, it is
going to be over a trillion dollars a
year. A medication that would cure
Alzheimer’s is going to save this coun-
try, literally, trillions of dollars.
When I go back home, people ask me
a couple of things. Number one is, they
want us to lower the cost of
healthcare, to lower the cost of pre-
scription drugs. But they also want us
to balance the Federal budget. If we
are ever going to be able to balance the
Federal budget, we have to start driv-
ing the cost of healthcare down. And
innovation is the way that we are
going to do this.
I hope everybody understands that
the Democrats’ H.R. 3 does just the op-
posite. By their price fixing, they are
going to stop innovation. Drugs that
are going to cure Alzheimer’s are never
going to come, and I haven’t even
started talking about hepatitis.
When you and I were in college, and
in medical school and pharmacy
school, there weren’t cures for hepa-
titis, but now we have vaccines for it.
Hepatitis C was a death sentence. Now
we have medication, a medication you
take, one pill a week for 12 weeks—95
percent cure of hepatitis. So that pa-
tient that was going to end up with a
liver transplant that was going to cost
$500,000, we have cured them with an
outpatient medicine.
I think about all the cures for cancer,
CAR-T cell therapy, new innovations
out there, spinal muscular atrophy—so
many things—cortical blindness. For
the sake of humanity, we cannot let
H.R. 3 happen.
We need H.R. 19, the Lower Costs,
More Cures Act. That is what is going
to drive down the cost of healthcare
and bring great solutions, great new in-
novation to this country.
And again, Madam Speaker, I thank
Congressman CARTER for leading on
this very important issue.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentleman.
At this time, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE),
another valued member of our Doctors
Caucus.
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from
Georgia, a pharmacist, leading this dis-
cussion. It is so important the leader-
ship that Representative CARTER has
taken in this role in addressing this.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in
strong opposition of H.R. 3. This would
severely constrain biomedical innova-
tion, limit the access to future cures,
and ultimately harm so many patients
across America.
While all of us agree that we must
act as a Congress to lower the cost of
prescription medicine, this bill takes a
fundamentally incorrect approach that
would jeopardize Americans’ access to
new medicines and have a negative im-
pact on patient outcomes.
As a physician, as a legislator, I have
witnessed new cures that offer hope to
patients facing devastating diagnoses.
As recently as 10 years ago, when I
would see a patient presenting with
metastatic melanoma, the prognosis
often would be fatal. Now, thanks to
the advent of new biologic therapies,
patients diagnosed with widespread

metastatic melanoma have a chance to
live, a chance to embrace life.
Let me be clear about this issue.
Passing H.R. 3 would deprive patients
and their loved ones of a chance for a
cure.
Fortunately, we have the alternative
in H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures
Act, of which I am proud to be an origi-
nal cosponsor. This bill is a package of
more than 40 bipartisan provisions that
would actually become law and have
real impact on our patients, on our
constituents. And in addition, would
ultimately lower drug prices.
Madam Speaker, I am grateful to Mr.
CARTER for leading this discussion and
for hosting this Special Order on this
crucial topic.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the
invaluable experience that he brings to
Congress. That is another example of
one of the fine physicians that we have
in Congress.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr.
SCHWEIKERT).
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker,
I thank the gentleman for letting me
come and engage in this discussion,
and I may want to ask a couple ques-
tions. And we had my doctor friend
from Kansas here a couple minutes
ago.
A quick thought experiment: What is
the greatest economic threat to our so-
ciety?
It is actually our inability to have
enough resources to pay for the prom-
ises. So we have made promises in So-
cial Security. But Medicare, if you ac-
tually look at the 30-year window—
and, look, I’m on Ways and Means—
thanks for letting me intrude—but we
have made the promises in Medicare
really, really difficult. We are talking
potentially $103 trillion of deficit, if
you add in Social Security and Medi-
care, but it is mostly healthcare costs.
Well, it turns out, you can reduce the
unfunded liabilities in Medicare by 30
percent by just a cure, just a cure for
diabetes. I will argue the mechanisms
in this H.R. 3, this sort of Democrat
takeover of the pricing mechanisms
and the capitalization of the next gen-
eration of healthcare, does incredible
violence to the future.
Madam Speaker, I don’t know if Con-
gressman CARTER saw this, but remem-
ber, this is a reference pricing bill. The
underlying secret is the efficiencies
that are actually being claimed in this
bill, they are hiding behind something
that is really dark, and I don’t think
they have explained it.
So let’s say you are in Great Britain.
And what is a year of your life worth?
It turns out in Great Britain, the way
they would price a new pharmaceutical
that gives you a year of quality life, it
is a quality-year adjusted formula, and
it is $37,000. So you show up with a new
drug that is going to give you a year of
quality life, but it is $37,000. They do
not buy it.
What is your life worth? What is a
quality year of your life worth for a
year? Because this is what the left is
about to import into your country.
And understand, there are countries
out there that it is down to $19,000. If a
drug costs more than $19,000, but gives
you a year of quality life, they don’t
buy it.
That is the rationing mechanism
that the left is about to import here. In
many ways, just the stunning cruelty
of such a thing—and they haven’t told
the truth that this is actually where
much of their savings actually come
from—is denying you the things that
keep you healthy.
And this is the mechanism—and I
know it is a confusing chart—but func-
tionally, if that outlay crosses these
numbers, you do not get that pharma-
ceutical.
Yet, there are crazy things you and I
could be doing, just actually taking
your prescriptions, things we could
build into a model. That is half a tril-
lion dollars a year we could be saving
on our healthcare costs just by step-
ping up and changing the way we do
our public policy around pharma-
ceuticals.
And the left has completely cut us
out on the Committee on Ways and
Means, Republican ideas, on saying
there is a whole bunch of things we ac-
tually agree upon. Stop being so crazy
dogmatic with your hate and start
thinking about people’s lives and giv-
ing them a future, because if we can
cure parts of that 5 percent of the
chronic condition that is a majority of
our healthcare spending, we can have a
revolution in crashing the price of
healthcare in this country.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his
excellent points, very well-expressed.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. GRIFFITH),
another valuable member of the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce.
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I do
appreciate all that the gentleman has
done.
The bill that we are proposing as the
Walden amendment in the nature of
the substitute, actually deals with an
item that we have talked about a great
deal, and that is pharmacy benefit
managers.
I am going to give the gentleman a
second to talk about that, but I do
want to mention the item that I have
been bringing up a lot in these, and
that is the unconstitutionality of H.R.
3.
The problem is, as you know—and it
sounds shocking, but it is true—if you
don’t accept the price the government
is paying you, they take 95 percent of
your gross revenues on that drug. That
money they take from you, that pen-
alty is not tax deductible, doesn’t do
anything as far as what expenses you
put into it, so you are actually going
to lose money.
Now, as I said in my comments ear-
lier this evening, that is not negotia-
tion. That is, as the Godfather would
have said in the old movie series, ‘‘an
offer you can’t refuse.’’ I wish I could
do the voice; I can’t. But that is a prob-
lem.
And you don’t have to believe me. In
the committee I brought this up—the
committee didn’t necessarily believe
me—but the Congressional Research
Service has said this bill likely vio-
lates the Fifth and the Eighth Amend-
ments of the Constitution. This is a
nonpartisan group that works for Con-
gress that came out and said, Yeah,
there are some real problems here.
When you are being confiscatory, you
are not really negotiating. It is a prob-
lem.
Now, in our bill that we have put for-
ward that is bipartisan, we have some
things on a subject both of us are very
concerned about, and that is pharmacy
benefit managers. They are a big part
of the problem here. Drug manufactur-
ers we need to work on, but their bill
doesn’t do anything on this. Our bill
does.
Madam Speaker, if the gentleman
would tell the people just how that
sham works.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, just very quickly. Pharmacy
benefit managers are a big part of the
problem. What we have to have in the
drug supply chain is transparency, and
that is what we don’t have now. PBMs
bring no value whatsoever to the sys-
tem. They don’t do research and devel-
opment. All they do is take from the
system, so it is a big problem.
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I
would ask the gentleman, if this is not
true, as I understand it, the PBMs have
gone, in some cases, to the drug manu-
facturers, said, Raise your price. We
will do rebates. But those rebates don’t
help anybody in the donut hole. Those
rebates don’t help the citizen who is
paying a high deductible.
And what happens is they raise the
price. And even with the rebate, if you
are in one of those insurance compa-
nies that gets the rebate, and you don’t
have to pay as much or pay any more,
they increase their profit margin. And
they are making hundreds of millions
of dollars that we have no idea what
they are contributing, as the gen-
tleman was just saying.
Is that true?
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, that is true, and I thank the
gentleman for bringing that up. And I
thank him for his expert witness testi-
mony about the constitutionality of
H.R. 3, because we both know that it is
not.
Madam Speaker, we are very limited
for time here right now, and with your
permission, I want to end with this
story:
Madam Speaker, again, we are talk-
ing about real people. We are talking
about people like Richard Lutz. Rich-
ard Lutz was a store manager who
could be regularly found refereeing
youth football, basketball, and baseball
games around my hometown of Savan-
nah, Georgia.

H10122 December 11, 2019
Richard started having memory prob-
lems at 62 years of age. He was pre-
scribed Aricept to slow down the ef-
fects of Alzheimer’s, but before too
long, he needed to have someone with
him at all times. His wife, Barbara,
worked as a nurse, but they couldn’t
afford for her to stop working, too. So
Barbara and her four kids did as much
as they could to rotate as caregivers,
and they eventually hired another
nurse to help out as well.
Eventually, Richard’s memory dete-
riorated to the point where he lost his
ability to converse. For the last 11
months of his life, he could only re-
spond to his family members with, I
love you, too.
After a 7-year fight with Alzheimer’s,
Richard Lutz passed away at the age of
69. Today, Barbara hears from neigh-
bors and friends when they find out
someone they know and love gets diag-
nosed. They reach out to her and they
ask: What do I do? What do I do?
Barbara told me: All I can tell them
is pray for a cure. Pray for a cure.
Madam Speaker, we want the same
thing. We need the same thing. We can
achieve the same thing. And we can do
it without giving up hope for a cure for
Alzheimer’s or all the other diseases
that are out there.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
it is no secret that Washington Demo-
crats have been itching to impeach
President Trump since the moment he
took the oath of office. Remember the
Washington Post’s headline on Inau-
guration Day in 2017: ‘‘The campaign to
impeach President Trump has begun.’’
That was the Washington Post’s head-
line on Inauguration Day in 2017.
Just a few months later, in April of
2017, one leading House Democrat had
already made up her mind. She de-
clared she would ‘‘fight every day until
he’s impeached.’’ As an aside, this
same senior Democrat is one of the
committee chairwomen whom Speaker
PELOSI asked to help lead the impeach-
ment process. She was literally stand-
ing at the Speaker’s shoulder as she
announced yesterday that she will
bring two articles of impeachment up
for a vote. Yet she had had her mind
made up more than 2 years ago, long
before this supposedly fair inquiry.
This is sort of emblematic of their
whole process.
House Democrats announced yester-
day that they will rush ahead and pre-
pare to send the Senate articles of im-
peachment based on the least thorough
and most unfair impeachment inquiry

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6958 December 11, 2019
in modern history. Well, the House
Democrats’ denigration of their solemn
duty will not cause the Senate to deni-
grate ours. If the House continues
down this destructive road and sends
us articles of impeachment, the Senate
will take them up in the new year and
proceed to a fair trial.
Now, in the meantime, our col-
leagues’ obsession with impeachment
has left us with a host of important, bi-
partisan legislation that is still unfin-
ished at this late date.
For months, Senate Republicans
have been calling on our Democratic
colleagues to go beyond picking fights
with the White House and actually leg-
islate for the American people. Yet, for
practically the entire autumn, our
Democratic friends’ political calcula-
tion seemed to be that these vital
pieces of business could wait until the
eleventh hour because impeachment
was the higher priority—and wait they
have.
Finally, after weeks of pressure from
the Republicans and from hard-work-
ing Americans across the country,
Speaker PELOSI backed down yesterday
and announced that she will let the
House vote on President Trump’s
USMCA. The Democrats have stalled
this agreement for so long that it is
now impossible for the USMCA to be-
come law in 2019, especially given all of
the other urgent things they have
stalled right alongside it. The Demo-
crats have simply run out the clock.
Assuming the House Democrats send us
articles of impeachment next week, a
Senate trial will have to be our first
item of business in January. So the
USMCA will continue to be a casualty
of the Democrats’ impeachment obses-
sion for several more weeks before we
can actually turn to it. Yet I am glad
the Speaker is finally beginning to
bring her USMCA obstruction to a
close.
As we triage in the coming days, the
Republicans hope we will be able to
pass not only the NDAA conference re-
port but also government funding legis-
lation that allocates taxpayers’ hard-
earned money to urgent Federal prior-
ities. The NDAA has consistently
brought Members together from across
the political spectrum—and with good
reason—in that it gives Congress the
opportunity to set priorities for the
U.S. military of the future. The NDAA
helps to guide the Pentagon’s invest-
ments in modernization and readiness,
cutting-edge weapons and capabilities,
and in servicemembers and military
families.
I am grateful for the efforts by Chair-
man INHOFE and Ranking Member
REED, who made compromises from the
beginning and worked hard to ensure
the conference report remained true to
the 58-year tradition of a bipartisan
bill that prioritizes our military and
sets aside unrelated partisan priorities.
I cannot say the same thing about
the Democrats in the House, unfortu-
nately, but I hope they will learn from
this year’s difficult path to a con-
ference report. Next year, I hope they
will produce a bipartisan bill from the
beginning that will put our national se-
curity interests first. Now, obviously,
that authorizing legislation should be
paired with the appropriations measure
that will actually fund our service-
members’ tools and training and enable
our commanders to actually plan
ahead.
I am grateful for the hard work by
Chairman SHELBY, his counterpart in
the House, and our subcommittee
chairs to reboot a stalled appropria-
tions process and try to get bills over
the finish line in the short time that
remains.
To be frank, only a laser focus from
both parties in both Chambers on get-
ting results will create a path to pass
appropriations bills this year. There is
simply not the time left for my Demo-
cratic friends to continue haggling
over the exact kinds of poison pills,
partisan policy riders, and Presidential
transfer authorities that the Speaker
and the Democratic leader had explic-
itly agreed months ago would be off the
table. Under the agreement months
ago, these were supposed to be off the
table.
The White House, Republican leaders
in both Chambers, and the Democratic
leaders in both Chambers all agreed to
these parameters—literally pledged in
writing that these kinds of partisan
roadblocks would be kept out of the
process. So if all parties honor what
they agreed to, we should have an op-
portunity to agree on government
funding in time to make this a law this
month, which means next week.
Now that our Democratic colleagues
are back at the table, Senate Repub-
licans stand ready to do all we can in
the time we still have. Let’s end this
legislative year on the right foot. Let’s
deliver for our All-Volunteer Armed
Forces and for families all across our
country.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, over
in the House this week, Democrats are
taking up the latest installment in
their campaign to have the government
take over Americans’ healthcare: the
Pelosi prescription drug bill.
There is no question that high pre-
scription drug costs are a problem. One
in four seniors reports difficulty afford-
ing medications, and there are too
many stories of patients being forced
to ration pills or to abandon their pre-
scription at the pharmacy counter. But
the Pelosi drug bill is the wrong pre-
scription for the problem of high drug
prices. Why? Because it would reduce
Americans’ access to lifesaving treat-
ments and discourage investment in
prescription drug research.
Between 2011 and 2018, more than 250
new medications were introduced
worldwide. American patients have ac-
cess to nearly all of them, but that is
not the situation for patients in a lot
of other countries. The chamber of
commerce reports that patients in
France have access to just 50 percent of
those new drugs. French patients, in
other words, are missing out on fully
half of the new drugs that have been
introduced in the past 8 years.
Why do Americans have such tremen-
dous access to new drugs while other
countries trail behind? Because the
U.S. Government doesn’t dictate drug
prices or drug coverage. As statistic
after statistic demonstrates, when gov-
ernments start imposing price con-
trols, patients’ access to new drugs and
treatments diminishes.
Government price controls also dis-
courage the medical research and inno-
vation that produce the prescription
drug breakthroughs of the future. The
United States leads the world in pre-
scription drug innovation, and a big
reason for that is because the U.S. Gov-
ernment doesn’t dictate drug prices.
It wasn’t always this way. European
investment in drug research used to ex-
ceed U.S. investment, but that changed
when European governments stepped in
and started imposing price controls.
Today, European investment in drug
research and development is almost 40
percent lower than U.S. investment, in
large part because of European govern-
ments’ price controls.
No other country comes close to
achieving the number of prescription
drug breakthroughs that companies in
the United States achieve. That situa-
tion, however, is not going to last if
the Democratic Party has its way.
The Pelosi drug bill would impose a
system of government price controls on
up to 250 medications, and reduced ac-
cess to drugs and fewer medical break-
throughs would soon follow.
The California Life Sciences Associa-
tion released a statement noting that
the Pelosi drug bill could result in ‘‘an
88-percent reduction in the number of
drugs that are brought to market by
small/emerging companies in Cali-
fornia.’’ It goes on to say that ‘‘such a
dramatic decline would be felt most in
the higher risk/smaller population
therapeutic areas of R&D, including
new drugs for endocrine, metabolic, ge-
netic and rare diseases, and pediatric
cancers.’’ Again, that is from the Cali-
fornia Life Sciences Association. In
other words, there would be fewer med-
ical breakthroughs for those who need
them the most.
As I said earlier, the high cost of
some prescription drugs can be a real
problem for many families, but the an-
swer—the answer—is not to introduce a
government-run pricing system that
would mean that important prescrip-
tion drugs would not be there when you
or your child needs them.
There are a lot of things we can do to
lower the cost of prescription drugs

December 11, 2019
without resorting to government price
controls. Multiple Senate committees
have been actively engaged on this
topic. There are options for how to im-
prove transparency in a complicated
and often opaque drug-pricing process.
There are ideas to examine competi-
tion and consolidation in the pharma-
ceutical supply chain; to ensure that
generic companies can access the sam-
ples they need to develop a new generic
or biosimilar; to prevent companies
from engaging in patent thicketing to
block competition; to promote real-
time benefit tools to help inform con-
sumers of cheaper drug options; to ad-
vance value-based insurance design to
support coverage of high-value items
and services, like medicines, that peo-
ple with chronic conditions need to
manage their health; and to modernize
the Medicare Part D plan design and
cap seniors’ out-of-pocket costs.
Republicans in the House recently in-
troduced legislation on prescription
drug costs that both promotes innova-
tion and contains bipartisan ideas for
reform, including increased trans-
parency in drug pricing and provisions
to prevent drug companies from gam-
ing the system. This bill provides sev-
eral ideas passed by the Senate Fi-
nance Committee, while focusing on
policies that can be passed through
both Chambers of Congress. Impor-
tantly, it eliminates those policies that
have divided us.
There are bipartisan solutions on the
table. It is unfortunate that House
Democrats have abandoned bipartisan
efforts on drug pricing and have de-
cided to pursue their government-run
alternative.
It boils down, really, simply to this:
Government price controls mean access
to fewer drugs, and access to fewer
drugs means that when you or your
child or your mom or your dad needs a
lifesaving medication, that drug may
be out there, but it may not be out
there for you, and that is not accept-
able.
The Pelosi drug bill is a bad prescrip-
tion for the American people.

JERSEY CITY SHOOTING
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before
I begin, I want to express deep sym-
pathy for the families and the victims
of the shooting yesterday in Jersey
City, which left one fallen police offi-
cer, Detective Seals, and several by-
standers as victims. My heart goes out
to their friends and family today.
Local and Federal law enforcement
must investigate quickly and profes-
sionally so we can implement the best
responses. We are not sure yet if this
was motivated by hate or if it was
criminal in nature, but whatever the
answers, rest assured the response
must be swift, sure, and strong.
IMPEACHMENT
Mr. President, now on impeachment,
yesterday, the House Judiciary Com-
mittee announced two Articles of Im-
peachment against the President of the
United States. The articles allege that
President Trump abused the office of
the Presidency by soliciting the inter-
ference of a foreign power in our elec-
tions to benefit himself personally.
They also allege the President ob-
structed Congress in the investigation
of these matters.
The President has had every chance
to defend himself against these allega-
tions. He has had every chance to rebut
the specific evidence that was pre-
sented in the House. If there is infor-
mation or a witness who the White
House believes can provide exculpatory
evidence in defense of the President,
nothing is stopping them from testi-
fying under oath. But if the President
is so innocent, if this is a mere witch
hunt, then why isn’t he answering the
specific charges? Why is he blocking
witnesses from testifying who would
have direct knowledge of these facts?
The House has made an extremely
strong case. The burden now lies on the
President to rebut it, if he can. And
what the majority of Americans are
saying is that the fact that he refuses
to produce rebutting evidence, the fact
that he blocks witnesses from testi-
fying, the fact that he won’t let docu-
ments come forward may well indicate
that he did everything alleged in the
House proceedings.
To talk about things that are unre-
lated to the charges against the Presi-
dent have nothing to do with what hap-
pened here. The President merely needs
to claim his innocence. If he has noth-
ing to hide, he should have nothing to
fear from handing over documents or
allowing witnesses to testify. So their
silence, the silence imposed by the
White House on top officials with
knowledge of these dealings, speaks
volumes.
What has the President, the White
House, and their congressional allies
here in the Senate and the House tried
to do? Instead of defending the Presi-
dent with facts, the White House, the
President himself, and congressional
Republicans employ one fringe con-
spiracy theory after the next to explain
away the President’s conduct, even
though they have nothing to do with
the specific charges against the Presi-
dent.
Here in the Senate, unfortunately,
we have several Members on the other
side of the aisle who are forming their
own conspiracy caucus. Any conspiracy
theory pulled out of the air by known
pranks, then broadcast on FOX News,
which shows an all-too willingness to
broadcast this stuff, is then picked up
here as a diversion. Why do they want
to divert? Is it because they know the
facts can be answered?
For the past few weeks, certain Re-
publican Senators have repeated the
fiction invented by Putin’s intelligence
services that Ukraine, not Putin, inter-
fered in the 2016 election. They are
mouthing Putin’s propaganda. The Re-
publican Party is to be anti-Russian,
anti-Putin, anti-Communist, but now
all of a sudden, because President
Trump has created so many different
diversions because he seems to go
along with what Putin wants, these Re-
publicans have become Putin mouth-
pieces when it comes to these con-
spiracy theories.
Today, an example, the chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee is
holding a hearing on the report issued
this week by the Department of Justice
Inspector General, which found no evi-
dence of a political motive for the FBI
investigation into the Trump cam-
paign. The deputy counsel of the FBI
said there was an obligation to inves-
tigate—not by anyone’s design—once
they heard these allegations that came
from a credible source.
What will the Judiciary chairman
do? Will he focus on the central finding
of the IG report? I suspect not. I sus-
pect Republicans on that committee,
instead, will take every opportunity to
contort the facts to further the Presi-
dent’s baseless claim that the FBI was
out to get him. So many people ac-
cused of crimes and wrongdoing, in-
stead of addressing the issue when they
know they are guilty, blame the pros-
ecutor. That is not what our system of
justice is about.
But, astonishingly, that is what the
chief law enforcement officer of the
land, the Attorney General of the
United States, did yesterday in inter-
views. Contradicting the findings of his
own inspector general—someone who
would study the case for months, some-
one who the Attorney General himself
had recently praised as fiercely inde-
pendent and a superb investigator—
what Attorney General Barr did was
push the false narrative that the FBI
acted in bad faith when it investigated
the Trump campaign. Attorney Gen-
eral Barr has signed himself up to be a
charter member of the conspiracy cau-
cus.
The real bad faith is the relationship
between the Attorney General and his
oath of office. He did not swear to
‘‘support and defend President Trump,’’
but that is what he has done as Attor-
ney General. It is deeply, dangerously
corrosive to the primary rule of law in
our constitutional system.
At the same time, the Attorney Gen-
eral’s handpicked prosecutor John Dur-
ham put out a ridiculous statement on
Monday, criticizing the findings of the
IG report. Durham used to have some
credibility as a no-nonsense pros-
ecutor, but when Barr chose him, I
said, Uh-oh, because Barr is not a
down-the-middle guy. By putting out a

hugely partisan, political statement on
a pending investigation he is doing, Mr.
Durham has signaled to the world he is
not capable of producing a report that
anyone can take seriously.
Unfortunately, Mr. Durham, like too
many others, has aligned himself with
Attorney General Barr and consigned
himself to the world of alternative
truth facts, many of them on the
fringe. Whatever reputation Durham
had for fairness is now in tatters.
Now, Mr. President, there is a possi-
bility that the Senate will be served
with the Articles of Impeachment for
the President from the House. We may
soon, in all likelihood, confront the de-
mands of hosting a trial for the Chief
Executive and serving as judges and ju-
rors in determining the fate of that
trial. With such a weighty constitu-
tional responsibility on the horizon, I
implore my colleagues to stop dipping
their toes in the murky waters of con-
spiracy. Hew to the facts. Don’t pre-
judge the outcome. Remember our
oaths to the Constitution, our respon-
sibility to do impartial justice in the
Senate trial. That is our responsibility.
History will judge whether we live up
to it or not.
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. President, now, on the recent de-
cision about the wall by the Federal
court in Texas. Yesterday, the Federal
court in Texas issued a nationwide in-
junction, blocking the Trump adminis-
tration from using military construc-
tion funding to build his wall. The deci-
sion confirms what many Democrats
and a few Republicans in the past have
said. The President’s emergency dec-
laration, which allowed the adminis-
tration to steal the profits from mili-
tary families to pay for a wall Presi-
dent Trump promised Mexico would
pay for, is an outrageous legal power
grab.
The injunction is a win for the rule of
law. It should serve as a warning to Re-
publicans in Congress and the Trump
administration that the power of the
purse, given exclusively to Congress by
the constitution, cannot be usurped. At
his rally last night, President Trump
said, The courts are siding with me on
the wall. He had not read the decision.
He has already built so much of the
wall. Well, thank you, Mr. Trump. You
have just buttressed a portion of the
wall that President Obama built—noth-
ing new.
As we look ahead to concluding nego-
tiations on appropriations before the
end of the year, my Republican col-
leagues should remember that a Fed-
eral court ruled the Trump administra-
tion was beyond its legal right when it
took funding from other sources to
build a wall.
NOMINATION OF LAWRENCE VANDYKE
Mr. President, the VanDyke nomina-
tion, today, the Senate will vote on the
confirmation of Lawrence VanDyke to
serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of Ap-
peals. After seeing so many radical and
unfit judicial appointments over the
past few years, I am almost surprised
President Trump is still able to find
nominees like Mr. VanDyke who is un-
qualified, even in comparison to some
of the worst nominees we have seen
under this administration.
VanDyke has a history of bigoted
writing about LGBTQ Americans, rad-
ical views on even the most common-
sense gun safety legislation, and a
proven hostility to reproductive rights.
On top of his radical views, Mr. Van-
Dyke has received stunningly negative
reviews on his qualifications and tem-
perament. The American Bar Associa-
tion doesn’t do this much, but it rated
him ‘‘Not Qualified.’’ In over 60 inter-
views with Mr. VanDyke’s colleagues,
he was described as ‘‘arrogant, lazy, an
ideologue, and lacking in knowledge of
the day-to-day practice, including pro-
cedural rules.’’
It went on to say, ‘‘The nominee
lacks humility, has an ‘entitlement’
temperament, does not have an open
mind, and does not always have a com-
mitment to being candid and truthful.’’
This is whom we are voting on today,
my Republican friends. What is going
on? Because someone is hard right and
radical, we excuse all of their person-
ality defects found by the ABA? And,
amazingly, this is someone not even for
a district court but the circuit court.
This is getting to the point of utter ab-
surdity.
For obvious reasons, both home
State Senators objected to VanDyke’s
nomination. In the past, the Senate
would respect those objections. It
would be a check on someone so un-
qualified on getting to the bench, but
Leader MCCONNELL and Senate Repub-
licans are in such a rush to fill the
bench with these hard-right nominees
that they have blown through Senate
traditions and most standards of rea-
son and good judgment.
Please reject this nominee. He is so
unqualified. He is a low human being—
at least according to all of this—and he
will have a lifetime appointment on
the circuit bench? That would indicate
the decline of America, one more indi-
cation, unfortunately, propagated by
this administration.
TAX REFORM
Mr. President, finally, in a week or
so, it will be 2 years since Republicans
jammed through a massive tax cut for
corporations and the megawealthy on a
party-line vote.
Two years later, it is worth looking
back on the promises Republicans
made when selling this to the Amer-
ican people. At the time, the President
said the bill would be ‘‘a middle-class
miracle.’’ The administration promised
Americans would get a $4,000 raise.
Congressional Republicans said giving
a corporate tax cut would boost jobs
and investment.
Two years later, it is clear the tax
bill has failed to live up to any of those
sunny predictions. Middle-class wages
still aren’t growing fast enough to keep
up with the cost of living. Businesses
aren’t investing in newfound profits in
jobs or wages. In fact, since the passage
of the Trump-Republican tax bill,
while capital expenditures by busi-
nesses remain low—that is investing in
jobs and equipment and things that
employ people and give them better
wages—corporate stock buybacks,
which, by and large, benefit wealthy
shareholders, explodes, setting annual
records. Last year alone, over $1 tril-
lion was spent on stock buybacks,
while millions of middle-class Ameri-
cans didn’t see enough improvement in
their quality of life.
As many Democrats, including my-
self, predicted 2 years after its passage,
the Republican tax bill has overwhelm-
ingly benefited shareholders and cor-
porate executives, not workers and
their families. America will remember
that as we head into an election year.

BIPARTISAN AMERICAN MINERS ACT OF 2019
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise
today, and I want to make it very
clear—it is going to be very short and
succinct—that time is running out on
our coal miners. We need to fix this
now—not in 2020 but now. I will explain
why.
We have over 13,000 coal miners who
will lose their healthcare and 82,000
coal miners who will lose their pen-
sions next year if we do not do some-
thing now. That is why I am standing
here before you. That is why I am put-
ting a hold on all legislative business
coming through the Senate until we
get assurances.
This is not who I am. Anybody who
knows me, knows I don’t do this, but I
am so committed to the people who
built this country and to a commit-
ment we had in a 1946 agreement with
the Federal Government that they
would be able to have a pension and re-
tirement for the very difficult and very
dangerous hard work that they do.
They weren’t asking taxpayers or any-
one else to bail them out. It was com-
ing from the sale of the product, the
coal that they mine for the energy for
this country.
Only my bill, which is the Bipartisan
American Miners Act, has bipartisan
support on both sides in the Senate and
over in the House. I know if Congress
passed it, President Trump would sign
it. I know that.
Can you imagine being one of the
coal miners trying to enjoy your holi-
days this year knowing that you might
wake up January 1 with no healthcare
coverage and a reduction in your pen-
sion?
Let me explain to you the pensions.
The average pension of a coal miner—
most of these are widows now because
the miners might have passed away—is
$600 or less, so we are not talking about
thousands of dollars. We are not talk-
ing about that whatsoever. This is all
the means of sustaining a quality of
life or helping them through a quality
of life.
These coal miners and their families
deserve the peace of mind of knowing

peace of mind today, and no legislative
business will pass without coal miners
first.
I reluctantly say that we might be
here through Christmas or we might be
here through New Year’s, but I will do
and make whatever sacrifice I can for
the people who made the sacrifice for
us, and that is the coal miners who
provide the energy for us to be the
greatest Nation on Earth, for us basi-
cally to be the superpower of the world
and the leader of the free world. It is
because of the energy they have pro-
duced. If we can’t honor that, then
what do we honor, whom do we honor,
and what is our purpose for being here?
I ask each one of my colleagues to
please talk to all of our leaders. Let’s
come together sensibly. Let’s make
sure this is in the package we put to-
gether, and we will continue business
and be able to go home and enjoy the
holidays the same as they should be
able to enjoy the holidays. Our going
home and their not being able to enjoy
it is not who we are; it is not the Amer-
ican dream; and it is not who we are as
Americans.
I yield the floor.

HONORING STEPHEN CARR
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise
today to honor the life of Fayetteville,
AR, Police Officer Stephen Carr, who
made the ultimate sacrifice in the line
of duty on Saturday, December 7.
Officer Carr was sitting in his patrol
car in the parking lot behind the police
station when he was shot and killed.
The 27-year-old had been a member of
the Fayetteville Police Department for
21⁄2 years and was assigned as a patrol
officer in the Dickson Street entertain-
ment area.
In that short time with the police de-
partment, he demonstrated his profes-
sionalism and duty to upholding the
rule of law. The Fayetteville police
chief described Carr as an exemplary
officer who was an all-American boy.
The chief said at a press conference
over the weekend: ‘‘If I had 131 Stephen
Carr’s, I wouldn’t be more ecstatic.’’
Carr grew up in a law enforcement
family. He witnessed the dedication,
service, and commitment to protecting
the community by people he loved. His
friends described him as a strong and
kind person, whose lifelong dream was
to serve as a police officer.
He loved spending time outdoors
hunting and fishing. A graduate from
The Woodlands High School in The
Woodlands, TX, Carr played football
and earned recognition as an all-dis-
trict offensive lineman. He went on to
play football at Southwest Baptist Uni-
versity in Bolivar, MO, and his former
coach described him as a young man
who made a big impact on campus.
We rely on law enforcement officers
to keep us safe. Each day they put on
their uniform, knowing the risks that
come with public duty to serve and to
protect. Officer Carr’s death is a re-
minder of the dangers these first re-
sponders face daily and how quickly a
situation can go from ordinary to dead-
ly, which is why those willing to take
on this role deserve both our gratitude
and our respect.
The outpouring of support from the
Fayetteville community has been a
tremendous strength to the police de-
partment as they mourn the loss of a
brother in blue. I pray they we will find
comfort from this encouragement dur-
ing this very, very difficult time.
My thoughts and prayers go out to
Officer Carr’s family and friends. I also
stand with all Arkansans in expressing
our gratitude for Officer Carr’s service
and commitment to honoring the sac-
rifice that he and others have made to
protect us. We will forever remember
him as a true American hero.
With that, I yield the floor.

ator from Oregon.
TAX REFORM
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, over the
next 45 minutes or so, finance Demo-
crats will come to the floor, and we
will be discussing the second anniver-
sary of the Trump tax bill. As the
ranking Democrat, I am going to begin
it. I know my colleagues will be joining
me.
The Trump tax law is now 2 years
old, and for millions of middle-class
Americans, it is not a very happy anni-
versary. My own view is that the eco-
nomic legacy of the Trump administra-
tion will be that they spent $1.5 trillion
to widen the economic gap in America.
If I were to sum up what the law—the
Trump tax law—was all about, it was
about making wealthy people wealthier
and the middle class being an after-
thought. I am going to walk through
some of the reasons I reached that
judgment, and then my colleagues will
be getting into some of these issues as
well.
Donald Trump and Republicans in
the Congress promised—promised—
they would write a bill that was fo-
cused on helping workers and the mid-
dle class. The President told me per-
sonally that he thought he and people
like him should not get a tax break. He
said that to me personally, but that
simply wasn’t the case.
We were told that the Trump tax leg-
islation would pay for itself. That was
wrong by a couple of trillion dollars.
We were told that it would kick off a
towering wave of job-creating invest-
ments in so many hard-hit American
communities. That has not been the
case. We were told that workers would
get, on average, a $4,000 raise. That was
wrong once more. It was wrong on all
counts with respect to the promises
made to the American people.
What, in fact, did happen is rates
were slashed for folks at the top and
multinational corporations. The cor-
porations then turned around and shov-
eled that money back to the share-
holders who, by and large, are wealthy
themselves, and you saw a historic
boom in stock buybacks.
Now the sugar high has worn off, and
I have been going home for town meet-
ings open to all. I am going to be in a
county this weekend that President
Trump won. I will be listening to peo-
ple. I won’t give any speeches. I will be
just listening to people. What I hear at
these meetings in counties in Oregon
that Donald Trump won is that folks
see very little evidence that their lives
have changed or that somehow this tax
bill ended up trickling down to them.
My sense is, it is amazing that a bill
can cost so much and can borrow so
much and fail the middle class so thor-
oughly.
There are two issues that are impor-
tant to focus on going forward, and we
are going to talk about those. There is
a lot of talk about how congressional
Republicans and the Trump adminis-
tration are talking about another—an-
other—scam tax proposal, basically
going to the same playbook that made
the middle class an afterthought 2
years ago. I think it is important that
people understand that all the evidence
indicates this second bill isn’t going to
focus on the middle class either.
According to the reports in the press
that have been discussing this new Re-
publican proposal—which is, in effect,
an admission that the first proposal
failed the middle class while helping
the most fortunate—what we hear
about this new proposal is that Repub-
licans are considering what would
amount to yet another massive hand-
out for folks at the top of the economic
pyramid.
One Trump adviser is reportedly dis-
cussing a proposal that would effec-
tively wipe out the taxation of capital
gains, and we all know that a frac-
tion—a tiny fraction—of the American
people get most of those capital gains,
and they happen to be the most fortu-
nate.
The U.S. Tax Code is already a tale of
two systems. We have one for cops and
teachers. Their taxes are taken out of
every single paycheck. We have an-
other one for high flyers who can make
most of their money, for example, off
investments. To a great extent, be-
cause of the laws that allow them to
defer paying their taxes, those high fly-
ers can pay what they want when they
want to. I don’t know of any cops or
teachers in North Dakota or Oregon
who have that. Their taxes are taken
out of every paycheck once or twice a
month. Their system is mandatory.
If you are a high flyer and you make
most of your money off investments,
your taxes aren’t mandatory, and if
you use the doctrine of tax deferral,
you can just defer and defer and defer.
And after you pass, you can hand ev-
erything off to your kids, Johnny and
Mary, and they get the stepped-up
basis, and then they get to do the same
thing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6962 December 11, 2019
You have to have one set of rules
that applies to everybody. That is what
we, on our side of the aisle, have been
working for. We think you ought to
have one set of tax rules that applies to
everybody. That, by the way, gives ev-
erybody in America the chance to be
successful. That is what Bill Bradley—
somebody I look to for advice, a mem-
ber of the Finance Committee, and an-
other tall Democrat with a lot better
jump shot than mine—but he and Ron-
ald Reagan got together, and they pro-
duced a proposal that gave everybody
in America a chance to get ahead.
That is not what this new Trump tax
discussion is all about, this new pro-
posal. I am not talking about the top
paying a fair share. I will just mention
what it could mean for folks at the
very top. Wealthy people whose income
is based on capital gains could be off
the hook completely—completely.
The first Trump tax law took what is
already broken about our tax system,
and they embedded unfairness to the
middle class and made the problem
even worse. They are not going to fix it
by doubling down on the same failed
policies.
The second issue that the Trump
folks are apparently going to be focus-
ing on, going forward, is handouts to
billionaires and corporations. That is
the big accomplishment to date. It is
inseparable from the Trump agenda,
which is all about helping those at the
top at the expense of everyone else.
Donald Trump has sought to kick
more than 20 million Americans off
their healthcare since day one. He has
tried to gut Medicaid, which is a life-
line for so many seniors who depend on
long-term care and nursing homes, and
it is a centerpiece of our fight against
opioid addiction.
The President proposed slashing edu-
cation funding for students and teach-
ers and slashing housing funds at a
time when millions of Americans are
struggling to afford rent or to cover
the mortgage. I can go on—home heat-
ing assistance, Meals on Wheels, same
pattern again and again.
Tax handouts for the most fortunate
multinational corporations and billion-
aires—the ones we were told would pay
for themselves—sent the deficit into
the stratosphere, and then working
people and the middle class, in addition
to being an afterthought in terms of
benefits, are expected to endure the
pain of the Trump budget cuts.
Middle-class folks know they got a
raw deal in the Trump tax law in 2017.
That is why it has been so unpopular. I
was struck in the campaign of 2018 by
Republicans who thought they had
done something that would be so valu-
able to the American people. They
couldn’t even go out and talk about it
with middle-class folks because middle-
class folks would say: We didn’t really
see much of anything. We might have
gotten a little bit to take the family to
dinner, but we don’t remember getting
much of anything.
So, on the anniversary of the Trump
tax law, the people who are celebrating
are the high flyers and corporate ex-
ecutives who are tallying up stock
buyback benefits and the handouts
they got, but if you work for a living,
you really are saying: This sure looks
like a con job.
In the months and years ahead, my
Democratic colleagues and I on the Fi-
nance Committee and in our caucus are
going to be working with anybody who
is interested in fixing our broken tax
system for good. We have shown that is
our interest. Personally, I wrote the
only two comprehensive bipartisan pro-
posals to reform our taxes since Bill
Bradley and Ronald Reagan got to-
gether, first with Judd Gregg, then the
chairman of the Budget Committee
and, most recently, with our colleague
who is director of National Intel-
ligence, Dan Coats.
So I and others—and I see TOM CAR-
PER, a valued member of the Finance
Committee from Delaware here—are
committed to working with our col-
leagues in a bipartisan way to have a
tax system that gives everybody a
chance to get ahead. That is not what
we got 2 years ago, but we want it un-
derstood that we are going to continue,
and I say personally, as ranking Demo-
crat on the Finance Committee, that
we are going to continue to reach out
a hand of welcome to Republicans who
want to work for something different
than what passed 2 years ago and a tax
code that would create one set of rules
in America, built on fairness, that ap-
plies to all Americans.
I note my colleague from Delaware is
here to make remarks on this subject.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware.
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank
my colleague and my friend for his
leadership, and I thank him for yield-
ing the floor to me.
I have been here 19 years. It is pretty
hard to believe. Some of my detractors
say it seems longer. It has gone by
pretty fast. In the past, I have been
privileged to have been a naval flight
officer for many years and retired as a
Navy captain. I am the last Vietnam
veteran to serve in the U.S. Senate
today.
I have been privileged to serve as
treasurer, Congressman, Governor, and
Senator for my State. I loved being
Governor. I love being a Senator. I am
really lucky. There are 1,900 people in
the history of our country who have
had the privilege of serving here, and
we get to be among them.
Before I came here, I was Governor
for 8 years and got to be chairman of
the National Governors Association as
well. It was a huge honor to work with
Governors. There are a bunch of former
Governors here whom I get to work
with today. I like that a lot.
During the 8 years I was Governor,
we had 8 years of balanced budgets. In
7 out of those 8 years, we actually cut
taxes, but we always balanced our
budget. We paid down some debt, and
we earned an AAA credit rating for the
first time in State history. More jobs
were created in those 8 years—in the 8-
year period in the history of the State
of Delaware. I don’t say that to be
boastful. I didn’t create one of them.
As Governor, I tried to provide some
leadership and to work with stake-
holders in our State and in our govern-
ment and outside of government—peo-
ple from all walks of life and busi-
nesses large and small. I tried to create
a nurturing environment for job cre-
ation and job preservation. That is
what we tried to do, and we were pretty
good at it. We were pretty good at it.
We are still pretty good at it in Dela-
ware.
That nurturing environment is made
up of a lot of different things. Among
the elements are our workforce, people
who are educated, trained, and have
the experience to work to contribute in
the workplace, whether it is agri-
culture, tourism, financial services,
manufacturing, technology, you name
it.
Right now, we have a big challenge in
filling all of these holes in jobs around
the country. We just got a jobs report
last Friday that shows how the job
market was going in the country in the
month of November. One of the things
we learned in the jobs report was that
maybe about 156 million or 157 million
people went to work in November every
day, but there are 5 million or 6 million
jobs where nobody showed up. Nobody
showed up because they didn’t have the
skills, the education, or the training,
or they didn’t live in the right part of
the country, they didn’t want to do
that kind of job, or maybe they
couldn’t pass a drug test.
A lot of jobs are going wanting in
this country. That has to be a concern
as we try to provide a nurturing envi-
ronment, work on the workforce side of
preparing them for success, and help to
bolster the growth of our economy
going forward.
Among the other pieces of that nur-
turing environment, besides the work-
force, are access to foreign markets
and the investment by the Federal
Government and State governments,
too, in the private sector to put invest-
ment into research and development
that can be commercialized in order to
create the successful businesses going
forward in the future.
Transportation is important, not just
roads, highways, and bridges, but rail
transportation, shipping, air. All of
that is important. Access to the inter-
net—there are a lot of places in the
country that don’t have access to the
internet. We think they are just in
rural areas, but a lot of them are in
cities—in cities that have tough neigh-
borhoods and are struggling.
Last night I was privileged to have
dinner with the cabinet secretary for
the State of Delaware, who has been
working in a great partnership in our
State, where the State provides money
and we work with private sector part-
ners to help bring broadband to vir-
tually every rural part of our State.

That is a great goal, and I think we are
closing in on achieving that. That is
another important element in the envi-
ronment for successful businesses and
for business growth.
Other ingredients include public safe-
ty, and they include the protection of
our intellectual property, cyber secu-
rity, and the ability to make sure that
for our products—whether they are
goods and services, or goods or serv-
ices, or both—we have the ability to
sell those into markets around the
world without impediment.
Another one that is important is the
Tax Code—a tax code that is fair, a tax
code that fosters economic growth, a
tax code that is not incredibly difficult
for people to understand and comply
with, and a tax code that doesn’t leave
us with a huge hole in our budget def-
icit.
The folks at CBO tell us these days,
if we look at spending as a percentage
of GDP—Federal spending as a percent-
age of GDP—today, it is a little over 20
percent, maybe 20.5 percent. The per-
centage of revenues of GDP is about 16
percent. When you spend 20 percent of
GDP and you raise about 60 percent of
GDP revenue, that delta there is our
deficit.
The deficit for the last fiscal year
was $850 billion. I haven’t sat down and
added this up. That is probably more
than the first 200 years of our country,
combined, and it is $850 billion in 1
year.
The deficit for the current year is ex-
pected to be $1 trillion. It is an un-
imaginable number, except maybe in
the case of a war, like World War II or
maybe World War I.
I serve on the Finance Committee
with Senator WYDEN, Senator BROWN,
who is on the floor now, and Senator
STABENOW. We were faced with the op-
portunity to do smart things with re-
spect to our Tax Code, to try to make
it more fair, better able to foster eco-
nomic growth, less complex, and, actu-
ally, to reduce deficits.
As it turned out, without a single
Democratic vote—in fact, we didn’t
have the opportunity to offer amend-
ments as the measure moved through
committee and on to the floor through
the Senate, and we had no opportunity
to offer amendments.
I just sat in a hearing in the Finance
Committee a few minutes ago, and
they quoted Rob Wallace, from Wyo-
ming, a senior official now in the Inte-
rior Department. Rob Wallace likes to
say that the best solutions are the
most lasting solutions, and they are bi-
partisan solutions. They are bipartisan
solutions. We had the tax changes.
They were massive changes in the Tax
Code that were run through here with-
out any bipartisan support.
We were told at the time the tax bill
was signed into law by President
Trump that it would pay for itself, that
it would not increase deficits—that it
would actually pay for itself, it would
lower taxes. It would pay for itself, and
we would have more revenues.
As it turns out, that is not true. It
wasn’t true this time, and, frankly, it
has been asserted many times that if
we can continue to cut taxes, revenues
will just flow, and everything will be
just hunky-dory. That is not true, un-
fortunately.
Almost 2 years, to the day, have
passed since the Republican tax bill
was enacted. I think it is time to take
a good look at some questions that my
Democratic colleagues and I posed
when we were debating this bill, to see
how this law has fared.
First of all, is it fair?
A fair tax law would have ensured
that working families in Delaware and
across the country share in the bene-
fits of tax reform. Unfortunately, the
2017 Republicans tax law fails the fair-
ness test in spectacular fashion.
According to the nonpartisan Tax
Policy Center, by 2027, the top 1 per-
cent of earners will receive 83 percent
of this tax law’s relief. Eighty-three
percent is for the top 1 percent. By the
same time, Americans earning less
than $75,000 will actually see their
taxes go up. How about that?
When it became clear that the
wealthiest Americans would get the
lion’s share of the benefits, this admin-
istration tried to play a game of smoke
and mirrors with the American people
by promising that their massive cor-
porate tax giveaway would trickle
down to working families.
President Trump told us that the av-
erage household would see their income
increase by $4,000 to $9,000 per year.
Sadly, it is clear that has not hap-
pened. In fact, according to a report by
the nonpartisan Congressional Re-
search Service, ordinary workers saw
very little wage growth in 2018.
What about the bonuses that workers
were promised? That same Congres-
sional Research Service report shows
that the bonuses attributed by compa-
nies to the tax law—when divided
among all American workers—comes
out to $28 per person. It is not exactly
the rewards that were promised.
The second question is, how does this
tax law encourage economic growth? It
was passed at a time when we were
about 8 years into the longest running
economic expansion in the history of
the country when this was enacted. It
came as the economy was growing con-
sistently for almost a decade.
Two years ago, a survey of top econo-
mists from across the political spec-
trum found that only 1 out of the 43 ex-
perts surveyed believed this type of tax
reform would boost economic growth.
It turns out that the other 42 were
right. Don’t take my word for it. Let’s
look at some facts.
The CRS report I mentioned earlier
found that in 2018, GDP grew at 2.9 per-
cent, the same as what the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office predicted
before the tax law was factored in.
Business investment did increase in
2019, but CRS found that the invest-
ment patterns did not align with the
incentives of the 2017 tax law, raising
questions about how much longer term,
sustainable growth will result from the
law. For example, CRS found that the
tax law made investing in R&D com-
parably more expensive than investing
in other areas, such as equipment and
structures. But R&D investment actu-
ally increased faster than investment
in equipment and structures in 2018.
In fact, now that the sugar high of
the corporate tax cuts has passed, busi-
ness investment has started to slow in
2019 to the point where the Federal Re-
serve has cited what they call contin-
ued softness in business and invest-
ment as a key reason for the Fed’s
most recent interest rate cut. Instead
of sustained investments, corporations
have used their savings from the tax
law for record-setting stock buybacks
that have an outsized benefit for
wealthy shareholders and senior execu-
tives.
Job growth follows the same pattern.
Despite President Trump’s constant
self-congratulations over jobs numbers,
job growth has averaged about 180,000
per month so far in 2019, down from the
sugar-high average of 223,000 per month
in 2018. In fact, average job growth in
2019 is more comparable to job growth
in 2016, where it was about 193,000 a
month. In 2017, it was about 179,000 per
month, in the 2 years leading up to the
tax law’s enactment.
The third question: Did it simplify
the Tax Code?
One goal of tax reform was supposed
to be simplifying the Tax Code, to re-
duce the unpredictability and uncer-
tainty, but the 2017 Republican tax law
fails on this question too.
In 2017, Republicans said that after
tax reform, Americans would be able to
file their taxes on a postcard. What we
ended up with last year is a mighty big
postcard—one that included six new
schedules, and, as then-National Tax-
payer Advocate Nina Olson predicted,
caused additional complexity and has-
sle for taxpayers, increased the risk of
errors, and resulted in higher tax prep-
aration bills for most American fami-
lies. In fact, the word ‘‘postcard’’ got
to be so unwieldy that the IRS has now
redesigned the form to look more like
the one Americans filled out pre-tax
law.
We also failed to get greater cer-
tainty from the 2017 tax law. I have
heard from Delaware families and busi-
nesses alike that they are concerned
about the impact of the tax law’s mis-
takes and unintended consequences—
an unsurprising development since our
colleagues rushed to pass the law in
the dead of night without any public
hearings and with changes scribbled in
the margins.
What is more, the law created a new
fiscal cliff at the end of 2025, which
makes tax policy unpredictable for
families and businesses.
That brings me to my fourth and
final question: Has it been fiscally re-
sponsible?
Even though the law’s individual pro-
visions—including the increase in child

tax credit increase in the standard de-
duction—expire at the end 2025, this
law blows a $1.5 trillion hole in our na-
tional debt. And it will be far costlier
than that as the deficits grow in the
years and decades ahead.
Two years ago, our Republican
friends in Congress and the administra-
tion repeatedly claimed their tax law
would pay for itself. As I said earlier, it
just hasn’t happened.
According to the nonpartisan Con-
gressional Budget Office, U.S. tax rev-
enue in 2018 was $275 billion lower than
if the tax law had not been enacted and
lower than otherwise would have hap-
pened. This sharp drop in corporate in-
come tax revenue has been particularly
dramatic.
CBO data shows that corporations
paid $135 billion less in 2018 than they
would have if the law had not gone into
effect—a decline of nearly 40 percent.
As a result, U.S. revenue as a percent-
age of GDP in 2018 was 16.4 percent, a
lot lower than the 19 percent during
the 4 years of balanced budgets in the
Clinton administration, when we had a
Republican majority in the House and
Senate.
The other side of this equation is,
again, that the spending was 20.5 per-
cent. That delta between those two
numbers explains the deficit.
Let me close with this. I would like
to quote a fellow from Wyoming, who
was recently before the Energy and
Public Works Committee. He has been
nominated to be the head of the part of
the Interior Department that includes
national parks and fisheries and wild-
life. He used to work for Malcolm Wal-
lop here. He is a longtime friend of
JOHN BARRASSO and I think others
from Wyoming, MIKE ENZI. He is a very
impressive guy. I like him a lot. This is
one of the things he said: Bipartisan
solutions are lasting solutions. That is
what he said. He said: Bipartisan solu-
tions are lasting solutions.
The tax law that was enacted 2 years
ago was not a bipartisan solution. As it
turns out, in retrospect, it has not been
fair, it has not fostered the kind of eco-
nomic growth long term that we ex-
pected or hoped or told it would bring,
and it has not made the Tax Code all
that much simpler. And, finally, it has
just dramatically inflated the budget
deficit. That is not sustainable. Other
than that, it turned out just great.
I yield the floor to some others who
have been waiting, including Senator
BROWN and Senator STABENOW.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
PERDUE). The Senator from Ohio.
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate the comments of Senator CARPER
and Senator WYDEN and all the mem-
bers of the tax-writing committee with
Senator STABENOW. I believe a couple
more Senators will join us—I believe
Senators CARDIN and CANTWELL.
Thanks for the work you do, Senator
STABENOW, on this issue and so many
others.
We all know now what the Trump tax
scam did. We know it was a giveaway
to the richest people in the country. It
was a $1.5 trillion tax cut. Seventy per-
cent of it went to the wealthiest people
in the country. We know that. We pret-
ty much knew that in the beginning.
We know the President said all kinds of
things—one lie after another—about it.
I want to tell two stories. One of
them is from when I was at the White
House with the President and half a
dozen other Senators sitting in the
President’s Cabinet Room when he was
talking about the tax bill. He said to
me and to other Senators that every
American will get at least $4,000 more
in their paycheck—at least. I guess he
meant people in Gallipolis and Ironton,
OH, and Portsmouth and Cleveland and
Lansing, MI, and Kalamazoo and every-
where else. He said everybody was
going to get $4,000. That is what he said
when the bill was being written. When
he signed it, he said everybody was
going to start seeing a lot more money
in their paychecks. Well, he lied. No
surprise there—he always does that. He
lies about a lot of things. But I particu-
larly take it personally when he lies
about something like that; when voters
in Lima and Piqua, OH, don’t get what
he promised them; when citizens and
workers just don’t get the help.
At the same time, when I was at that
meeting, I went up to the President. I
had in my hand a bill I was working on
called the Patriot Corporation Act. I
went up to the President after the
meeting. I had mentioned it during the
meeting, and then I walked up to him
and said: Mr. President, this is the Pa-
triot Corporation Act. I want you to
consider this.
Unlike the bill we were looking at,
which gave tax cuts to all kinds of cor-
porations and all kinds of the wealthi-
est people in this country, the Patriot
Corporation Act was simple. The Pa-
triot Corporation Act said: If you pay
your workers a decent wage; if you pro-
vide adequate benefits—health and re-
tirement—to your workers; and if you
are in manufacturing and you do your
production in the United States, then
you will get a break on your taxes. So
if you do things right as an employer—
decent wages, decent benefits, do your
production in the United States—you
get a lower tax rate. But if you don’t,
if you pay low wages or outsource jobs,
you pay something called the corporate
freeloader fee.
This is because so many companies in
this country—they might be retail out-
lets, whatever these companies are—
pay $8 or $10 or $12 an hour, and their
workers are eligible for Medicaid, food
stamps, Section 8 housing, and, basi-
cally, those companies are subsidized
by taxpayers. So why not have a tax
system where corporations that do the
right thing get a lower tax rate, and
corporations that rely on the govern-
ment to fund them—food stamps, the
earned income tax credit, Medicaid,
and all of that—those corporations
ought to pay a corporate freeloader fee
to the government.
That is the first story. The second
story I wanted to tell you about—the
three of us right here in this room
right now, Senator CARDIN and Senator
STABENOW and I, were in the midst of
this—when this tax bill was written, it
was written in the Senate Finance
Committee. You know, when we do
things in the Senate, we do these
things out in public—in the Senate Fi-
nance Committee—but we know that
much of the work is done in Senator
MCCONNELL’s office down the hall. That
is where the corporate lobbyists who
want these big tax cuts line up.
We were doing our public meeting in
the Senate Finance Committee, and
they were in such a hurry to pass this
bill. We worked way into the night,
which we are all fine with doing, but
the next day we worked, they were
moving so fast that we would get an
amendment that would be handwritten
in not very good writing, and it would
be added to the bill, and we really
didn’t know exactly what we were vot-
ing on. They didn’t want to give us
time to do it.
The people who run this place—Sen-
ator MCCONNELL and the special inter-
est lobbyists who line up down the
hall—know that if they can operate
and people can’t understand what they
are doing—they will work all night
sometimes. They will do things by
hand instead of actual legible writing
so that we end up with the kind of con-
fusion that came out of that. Well, you
know what happened, Mr. President.
There were all kinds of mistakes in
this bill, and the President signed it.
We didn’t know what the mistakes
were, but then we found out.
Now Republicans are coming back
and they want us to clean up this mess.
Well, cleaning up the mess means more
corporate tax breaks, more giveaways
to corporate America, and more help
for the richest 1 percent in this coun-
try.
We are saying: We want to fix the
technical mistakes you made when you
hurried through this bill. We want to
do that. We all voted against the bill
because it was a corporate giveaway
and a giveaway to the rich. We want to
fix this so the Tax Code actually reads
right and there won’t be all these court
cases regarding it. But if we are going
to do that, you are going to give some
tax breaks to middle-class families,
and you are going to pass legislation
expanding the earned income tax credit
and the child tax credit.
We have simply said to the President
and to the Republican majority that
writes these bills that we will work
with you. We want to do that, but you
are not going to hurt middle-class and
working-class taxpayers again. You are
going to expand the earned income tax
credit, take care of electric vehicles
and the kinds of issues we want to do
there, but fundamentally you are going
to help low-income and moderate-in-
come children whose parents work just
as hard as any Senators work but don’t
have much to say for it.
Again, it comes down to, whose side
are you on? Are you going to stand

with workers, or are you going to stand
with corporations? Do you fight for
Wall Street, or do you fight for the dig-
nity of work? If you love this country,
you fight for the people who make it
work. The President promised to fight
for American workers. He betrayed
American workers, as he has betrayed
American workers on minimum wage
and overtime and trade deals. He has
betrayed workers over and over again.
He broke that promise he made.
It is important that we fix it and we
fix it for the broad middle class in this
country.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan.
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I
want to join with my colleagues today
in expressing great dismay as we are
approaching the 2-year anniversary of
the massive Republican tax giveaway.
Middle-class families and workers have
not gotten even remotely close to what
they were promised. Instead, President
Trump and Republicans gave the big
drug companies, the wealthiest Ameri-
cans, and other special interests an
enormous tax cut just in time for the
holidays. Merry Christmas to them.
But what did he give the majority of
families in Michigan? He gave them
the equivalent of a beautifully wrapped
gift box with nothing in it. There is a
word for that, when you make a bunch
of promises and fail to keep them. In
Michigan, we call that a betrayal.
President Trump made some really
big promises about the Republican tax
giveaway. In his words, it would be
‘‘one of the great Christmas gifts to
middle-income people.’’ Unfortunately,
President Trump turned out to be less
like Santa Claus and more like Ebe-
nezer Scrooge. The wealthiest 1 percent
of taxpayers received an average tax
cut 64 times the size of the one given to
the middle class.
He said—as my other colleagues have
referred to—people would get an aver-
age of $4,000 more in their income. We
in Michigan are still waiting for that
$4,000 per person who is working to
show up. What happened is, the real
number is about $514. And what is even
worse is that bonuses for working peo-
ple have actually gone down 22 percent
since the tax giveaway passed. Bonuses
are down, not up. You don’t have to
have the math skills of Bob Cratchit to
know that is far from what was prom-
ised.
He also promised that businesses
would use their tax windfall to invest
in workers and create jobs. Unfortu-
nately, that has not happened. We
know that in the third quarter of this
year, business investment was a nega-
tive 2.7 percent. That is the second
straight negative quarter for business
investments despite the promise of
‘‘tremendous’’ business investment. I
am deeply worried because we have had
two straight quarters now of contrac-
tion on manufacturing, which is actu-
ally the technical definition of a reces-
sion. Coming from Michigan, where we
proudly make things and grow things,
that is deeply concerning to me.
Meanwhile, in the first year of the
Republican tax betrayal, businesses re-
warded CEOs and wealthy shareholders
with more than $1.1 trillion in stock
buybacks. What does that mean? That
means you do a buyback of your stock.
It drives up the price of the company
stock. It enriches the CEOs and major
shareholders but does nothing for the
workers. In fact, corporations spent 140
times as much money on stock
buybacks as they did on increasing
wages and benefits for workers. In 2018
alone, the 10 biggest drug companies
spent $115 billion—with a ‘‘b’’—on
stock buybacks and dividends, but I
don’t recall seeing the cost of medicine
go down. Instead, they keep raising the
prices, which is outrageous.
Perhaps the most ridiculous promise
that President Trump made was on the
national debt. He said: ‘‘We have $21
trillion in debt.’’ That is what he said
back in July 2018. ‘‘When [the Repub-
lican tax law] really kicks in, we’ll
start paying off that debt like water.’’
I am not exactly sure what that meant,
but it didn’t happen. Instead, the Fed-
eral budget deficit has risen by $319 bil-
lion so far, and counting, since the pas-
sage of the Republican tax law.
To add insult to injury, our friends
across the aisle doing the budget used
the fact that there was a deficit to one
more time say that we need $1.5 tril-
lion in cuts to Medicaid and $800 billion
in cuts to Medicare to reduce the def-
icit because, oh my gosh, we have a
deficit, so we should take healthcare
away from seniors and families across
America.
On top of all of that, the Trump ad-
ministration now is implementing
rules that could take food assistance
away from up to a million people who
work part time or seasonal work. They
get a job at the mall during Christmas,
but then they lose it. They are in and
out of the market. By the way, the av-
erage amount of help to these men and
women who are working hard, trying
to hold it together, is $127 a month—
just barely making sure they are not
starving. As another Republican Presi-
dent once said, ‘‘There you go again.’’
Let me say in conclusion that 2 years
ago, President Trump promised middle-
class families, working families across
Michigan and the country, a whole lot
of things. He said that the deficit
would disappear, that corporations
would pass along their tax savings in
the form of jobs and better wages, and
that people would get $4,000 more in
their paychecks, in their income. He
said that this giveaway would be one of
the great Christmas gifts to middle-
class people. Instead, the majority of
Americans got a lump of coal.
Promises have not been kept. We be-
lieve in keeping promises in Michigan.
This is about more than the numbers;
it is about making sure everybody who
is working hard is treated fairly and
has a fair shot to care for their families
and have the American dream. That is
not what happened with this tax give-
away.
I yield the floor to the Senator from
Maryland.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I join
my colleagues on the floor today to
point out that 2 years ago, we had an
opportunity in the Congress to reform
the Tax Code. The Tax Code, basically,
was the one enacted in 1986. In 2017, we
had an opportunity to reform that Tax
Code, and that opportunity was missed.
What the Republicans did, instead of
engaging in a truly bipartisan process
that would have used the expertise of
all Members of Congress, they went on
a partisan mission in order to help big
corporations and wealthy taxpayers at
the expense of middle-income tax-
payers and fiscal responsibility. As a
result, our children and grandchildren
will pick up the tab for this bill, and
those who are going to benefit will not
be middle-income families. They are
the losers. The ones who are going to
benefit will be big corporations and
wealthy taxpayers.
Let me just talk about some things
that should be the basic ingredients for
tax reform.
First, it should be fair to the tax-
payers of this country. The tax bill
that was enacted 2 years ago was cer-
tainly not fair. It failed in that test. As
I pointed out, who benefited? Large
corporations benefited dramatically by
this bill, but they said: Look, we will
pass it on to the workers. Yet did they
pass it on to the workers? In 2018, $1.1
trillion was used to repurchase stock
to make the wealthiest even wealthier,
and it did not go to the benefit of the
workers. The benefit was the greatest
on the personal income tax side as it
went to the highest income taxpayers.
They are the ones who benefited the
most, and it was not fair to middle-in-
come taxpayers.
Secondly, a tax reform bill should be
fiscally responsible. After all, we have
taxes in order to raise revenue, in order
to pay for services so we don’t borrow
from the future—from our children and
grandchildren—to pay for what we are
doing today. The administration said
this would be a fiscally responsible bill.
The verdict is back, and $2 trillion has
been added to the national deficit—$2
trillion. It has certainly failed on fiscal
responsibility. Corporate taxes have
gone down 40 percent. So we have given
a break to corporations at the expense
of our deficit. Who is picking up the
bill? Middle-income taxpayers are pick-
ing up the bill.
Thirdly, the Tax Code should be effi-
cient, and we should try to make it as
simple as possible. No one can argue
that the 2017 tax bill has simplified the
Tax Code or has made it more efficient.
To the contrary, we are now told we
are going to need technical corrections
because of the mistakes that were in-
cluded in it. I can say, in my talking to
many individuals who had the plan
based upon the Tax Code, that there is

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6966 December 11, 2019
so much more uncertainty in the Tax
Code now than there was prior to the
passage of the 2017 tax bill.
Who is going to pick up the tab? Mid-
dle-income taxpayers are going to pick
up the tab, and let me just give you
some examples.
The 2017 bill included a limitation on
State and local tax deductions, and let
me just talk a little bit about the tax-
payers of Maryland. Almost 50 percent
of Maryland’s taxpayers used the
itemized deduction and took the advan-
tage of taking off of their Federal taxes
what they paid in State and local taxes
so they didn’t have a tax on a tax. As
a result of the limitations that were
imposed in 2017, these taxpayers are
now no longer able to take the full
amount of the State and local tax de-
ductions. In fact, because of the full
changes, Maryland’s number is down to
about 25 percent when we did have al-
most 50 percent taking advantage of
itemized deductions. We have lost
about half of those filers who today
can’t take any of those tax deductions.
This is an affront to federalism, and
it also hurts middle-income taxpayers.
It is philosophically wrong to have a
tax on a tax. So the verdict is in with
Maryland taxpayers, and the average
refunds are down 6 percent. The re-
funds are what middle-income tax-
payers depend on, and they are down in
our State.
It has also affected the ability of
State and local governments to provide
essential services that are important
for all citizens. Yet whether it is their
support for public education, public
safety, et cetera, these essential serv-
ices are very much dependent on mid-
dle-income families. All of those are
now being stressed because of the re-
strictions on State and local tax deduc-
tions.
Let me also talk about middle-in-
come taxpayers. They don’t benefit
from the corporate tax cuts, which I al-
ready pointed out, but these tax cuts
were made permanent. The individual
tax changes were temporary in nature.
Again, this hurts middle-income fami-
lies.
Lastly, let me point out that it was
advertised by this administration that
it would strengthen our economy.
When you take a look at the first six
quarters since the passage of the 2017
tax giveaway to the wealthy families
and corporations, the gross domestic
product has grown about 2.5 percent,
which is far less than what the admin-
istration predicted. If you take the six
quarters before the passage of the bill,
it had gone up by 2.6 percent. So there
has actually been a slight decline, and
we haven’t seen a boost to the econ-
omy.
There is a better way to do this as
this bill ignores small business. I have
the opportunity of being the ranking
Democrat on the Committee on Small
Business and Entrepreneurship, and we
have had many discussions with small
business leaders who tell us this tax
bill actually hurts them—it doesn’t
help them—because they don’t pay the
C rate but, rather, the individual rate,
and the pass-throughs that were put in
here don’t benefit small companies. So,
when we are talking about helping the
driver of our economy—small busi-
ness—the tax giveaway 2 years ago has
made it even more difficult.
The better way is to work in a true
bipartisan fashion and engage all Mem-
bers of Congress on both sides of the
aisle. Let us truly change our Tax Code
so that middle-income families benefit
and so that we don’t burden future tax-
payers by our making irresponsible
changes that are not fully funded. Let’s
do it in a way in which it will help the
growth of our economy. That is what
we should be doing. There was a missed
opportunity 2 years ago, and it is mov-
ing the Nation in the wrong direction.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
SUICIDE PREVENTION COORDINATORS ACT
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise
today because far too many of our vet-
erans feel like they have run out of op-
tions when it comes to dealing with the
physical and mental scars of war.
These are folks who have served in de-
fense of our freedoms and who often
suffer tremendous invisible wounds of
war.
I can’t tell you the number of times
I have heard from men and women in
uniform, in Montana and across this
country, who feel helpless, and they
feel as though they have been aban-
doned by their own country. The facts
tell us that we are not doing enough
here in this body to help. The reality is
that our country loses as many as 20
Active-Duty or veteran servicemem-
bers each and every day due to suicide.
Regardless of political party, we can
all agree that one life lost to a suicide
is too many.
That is why, as ranking member of
the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee, I have been working with my
colleagues across the aisle—colleagues
like Senator SULLIVAN—to make sure
that our vets have the access to the
help and the care they need.
The bill that we are going to consider
here shortly—our Support for Suicide
Prevention Coordinators Act—is a bi-
partisan effort to help tackle the sui-
cide epidemic by ensuring that we take
a comprehensive approach to con-
necting veterans with urgent, life-
saving care. This bill starts by identi-
fying and addressing staffing needs for
VA employees and suicide prevention
professionals who are our Nation’s first
line of defense when it comes to com-
bating veteran suicide.
It is clear that we have much more to
do to prevent this national health epi-
demic, and it starts with under-
standing the scope of the problem. If
we don’t have the tools in place to take
care of these folks when they return
home, then, we should think twice be-
fore we send them in the first place.
I urge the Senate to vote for this bill
when it comes up and to get it passed
out of this body quickly so the Presi-
dent can quickly sign it into law.
It is not something that can solve
our suicide problems among our vet-
erans by itself, but it is certainly one
of the tools in the toolbox that can
help folks when they need help and to
ensure that no veteran slips through
the cracks.
I want to thank the Senator from
Alaska for everything he has done to
make sure that this bill becomes a re-
ality.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska.
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I
want to thank my friend from the
great State of Montana, Senator
TESTER. This is actually a bill that he
and I have cosponsored out of the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee, and it is a
companion bill that we are going to be
bringing over from the House to vote
on here in a couple of minutes to hope-
fully get this on the President’s desk
very soon to get him to sign it.
There is a lot of legislation that fo-
cuses on these kinds of issues: How do
we address this growing problem of sui-
cide in our country?
The real tragedy is that all suicides
are tragic, but there are very high
numbers of suicides that impact our
veterans.
My State, the great State of Alaska,
has more vets per capita than any
State in the country. We are proud of
that patriotic fact. Sadly, we also have
some of the highest suicide rates in
America.
So since I have come to this body, I
have had the privilege to serve my fel-
low Alaskans, and focusing on suicide
has been a very, very important issue
for me. It is a very important issue for
my constituents, and it is a very im-
portant issue for America. As a matter
of fact, the first bill I cosponsored as a
U.S. Senator was called the Clay Hunt
Suicide Prevention Act, which was
named after a young marine who had a
number of deployments, and, unfortu-
nately, when he was seeking help, he
couldn’t really get it, and this young,
brave hero took his own life.
This should be a priority for the Sen-
ate. We have been prioritizing the vet-
erans and the members of the military
who are in crisis when we draft legisla-
tion that tries to address these chal-
lenges, but what we are doing today is
also important.
This bill actually focuses on the peo-
ple who help our veterans. These are
suicide prevention coordinators. They
are specially trained employees at the
VA medical centers who identify and
connect high-risk veterans with the
care they need.
Across the Nation, these VA profes-
sionals conduct outreach, promote

awareness, and disseminate suicide pre-
vention best practices. They are, lit-
erally, on the frontlines.
But, as you can imagine, this isn’t an
easy job. This is a hard job, and there
are reports that many of these preven-
tion coordinators throughout the VA
system are overworked and unable to
keep up with their many responsibil-
ities. What we are focused on here is
that we want to make sure that the
people who are helping our veterans
are also taken care of and adequately
resourced so that they can do the best
job in terms of helping our veterans.
The VA must have a skilled and
resourced workforce available, trained
to recognize the warning signs of a vet-
eran in crisis, and then be able to work
with that veteran, hopefully success-
fully, to connect them with lifesaving
resources before it is too late.
That is what the Support for Suicide
Prevention Coordinators Act requires.
That is what Senator TESTER and I
worked on together to bring this out of
the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and,
hopefully, if we get that right, then, it
has a positive impact on lessening this
high rate of suicide among our vet-
erans.
Senator TESTER mentioned what is in
this, but it is not just additional re-
sources. It is also a comprehensive
study by the GAO to make sure that
our coordinators are resourced and
have a strategy to make sure they can
do their jobs most effectively to im-
pact our veterans.
It is an overall look at the VA sys-
tem of preventing veteran suicide with
a focus on these frontline coordinators
who do really, really important work.
They are not always recognized.
For those who are doing that work, I
commend you, the Senate commends
you, and I think we are going to have
an overwhelming vote here in a couple
minutes that will make sure of your
ability to do this really, really impor-
tant job for our veterans and for our
Nation and that you are going to be
able to do it better.
I applaud the leadership on both sides
of the aisle for bringing this bill to the
floor, and I encourage my colleagues to
vote in favor of this legislation. Let’s
get it on the President’s desk for his
signature soon, and we can take an-
other step—another step—to make sure
that we are taking care of our veterans
and are trying to address this horribly
tragic situation where far too many
veterans in America are taking their
own lives.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1416
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as all
America knows, climbing healthcare
costs continue to keep the American
people up at night. A Kaiser Founda-
tion poll in September found that the
No. 1 health concern of the American
people is prescription drug pricing. A
whopping 70 percent of those polled
think lowering prescription drug costs
should be a top priority—a top pri-
ority—for Congress, making it the No.
1 item on our to-do list, but our friend
and colleague from New York, the mi-
nority leader, objected last time I of-
fered unanimous consent to take up
and pass a bill, which I will describe
here momentarily.
I hope, given the intervening time
and further reflection, he will not do so
today, and we can get this bill passed
and address this top priority of the
American people.
The good news is, Republicans and
Democrats both agree we need to do
something about it. I have the honor of
serving on both the Finance and Judi-
ciary Committees, where we have been
looking into this problem and some of
the potential solutions.
There are pharmaceutical CEOs who
earn big bonuses as sales go up. I am
not opposed to them receiving com-
pensation, but pharmacy benefit man-
agers who negotiate backdoor rebates
that drive up out-of-pocket costs are a
problem because of the lack of trans-
parency.
What I find very seriously concerning
as well is anti-competitive behavior
when it comes to patents by drug man-
ufacturers. There are two practices, in
particular, that the legislation I intend
to offer a unanimous consent request
on would address.
One is called product hopping, which
occurs when a company develops a re-
formulation of a product that is about
to lose exclusivity. Let me just stop a
moment and say that one of the ways
we protect the investment and the in-
tellectual property of American
innovators is to give them exclusivity
over the right to sell and license that
intellectual property, including drugs.
That encourages people to make those
investments. In turn, it benefits the
American people and the world, lit-
erally, by creating new lifesaving
drugs, and that is a good thing. There
is a period of exclusivity, and after
that expires—after that goes away—
then it opens that particular formula-
tion up to generic competition; mean-
ing, the price will almost certainly be
much lower and more affordable to the
American people.
This issue of product hopping is
gamesmanship, as I will explain. First
of all, before the drug loses exclusivity,
the manufacturer pulls the drug off the
market. This is done not because the
new formula is more effective, but it
will block generic competitors.
The second issue is patent
thicketing, which occurs when an inno-
vator uses multiple, overlapping pat-
ents or patents with identical claims
that make it nearly impossible for
competitors to enter the market. This
is nothing more and nothing less than

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6968 December 11, 2019
abuse of our patent system, and it is
coming at a high cost for patients who
rely on affordable drugs.
Earlier this year, I introduced a bill
with our friend and colleague from
Connecticut, Senator BLUMENTHAL,
who happens to be a Democrat, to ad-
dress these anti-competitive behaviors.
Our bill is called the Affordable Pre-
scriptions for Patients Act, and it
streamlines the litigation process by
limiting the number of patents these
companies can use in court. So compa-
nies are spending less time in the
courtroom and, hopefully, more time
innovating these new lifesaving drugs,
while opening up these drugs once they
lose their exclusivity to generic com-
petition and more and more affordable
prices for consumers.
This legislation does not stifle inno-
vation; it doesn’t limit patients’ rights;
and it doesn’t cost taxpayers a dime. In
fact, the Congressional Budget Office
estimates it would lower—lower—Fed-
eral spending by more than a half a bil-
lion dollars over 10 years. This is just
savings to the Federal Government for
Medicare and Medicaid. Undoubtedly,
it would show significant savings for
consumers with private health insur-
ance as well.
I am sure it comes as no surprise,
then, that this legislation passed
unanimously out of the Judiciary Com-
mittee; not a single Senator opposed it.
That happened in June. This is Decem-
ber, and there has been no movement
since then.
We have tried to be patient because
we know there are other bills coming
from the Health, Education, Labor, and
Pensions Committee. There is a bill
coming out of the Finance Committee
on which the Presiding Officer and I
sit. My hope is that we would have
been able to make progress on a larger
package, but here we are at the end of
the year, and there has been no move-
ment. We have been more than patient,
but I think there comes a time when
patience ceases to be a virtue, particu-
larly when it comes to providing some-
thing that would benefit the American
people.
There are no concerns about the poli-
cies laid out in the bill, as you can see
by some of the comments reflected in
this chart. Again, our colleague, the
Democrat from Connecticut, Senator
BLUMENTHAL, said: ‘‘This bill offers a
positive, solid step toward ending
abuses in the use of patents.’’
Senator DURBIN, who is the Demo-
cratic whip, a member of leadership,
said:
It is a bipartisan measure that passed the
Senate Judiciary Committee. I not only
voted for it, I cosponsored it, and I believe it
should pass and should become the law of the
land.
So imagine my surprise when the
Democratic leader objected to a unani-
mous consent request to pass it a cou-
ple of weeks ago. He even went so far
as to call this ‘‘a manipulative cha-
rade’’ and ‘‘a little game,’’ which is
strange because he also called it a good
bill. His biggest criticism was it didn’t
do enough, but as I pointed out then, if
you sit around waiting for the big bill
to get passed, nothing happens in the
meantime, and it is a loss to the Amer-
ican people.
I think it is past time for us to take
up this legislation, get it passed, get it
signed by the President. Our friends in
the House of Representatives have al-
ready passed two bills, which, put to-
gether, essentially reflect the same
policy.
I can’t think of any other reason for
the Democratic leader to object than
pure politics. He doesn’t want anybody
to get a ‘‘win.’’ That also goes for the
Senator from Iowa, when she had of-
fered a bill to reauthorize the Violence
Against Women Act. She happens to be
on the ballot in 2020 as well. The only
rationale I can possibly think of that
the Democratic leader would continue
to object to these bipartisan consensus
bills is just that he doesn’t want some-
body to be able to score a point on this
side because he feels like that will dis-
advantage his candidates in the next
election and advantage us.
There comes a time when we need to
put those election considerations to
the side and focus on making good pol-
icy. I happen to believe good policy is
good politics.
The truth is, the Democratic leader,
in objecting to the passage of this leg-
islation, does have one very big and
powerful cheerleader behind him; that
is, the drug companies. The drug com-
panies love it when bipartisan legisla-
tion gets blocked on the Senate floor
for whatever reason. The truth is, they
hate this bill, and they don’t want to
see anything done on this issue. Inad-
vertently or not, the Democratic leader
seems to be providing them a lot of
cover right now.
My constituents didn’t send me to
Washington to play these endless
games. They sent me here to get re-
sults, and that is exactly what I aim to
do.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that as in legislative session, the
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of Calendar No. 132, S. 1416.
I ask unanimous consent that the com-
mittee-reported substitute be with-
drawn; that the Cornyn amendment at
the desk be agreed to; that the bill, as
amended, be considered read a third
time and passed; and that the motion
to reconsider be considered made and
laid upon the table.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, my
good friend, the Senator from Texas, is
just engaged in a gimmick to cover up
all that he hasn’t done on making drug
costs lower. Now, 99 percent of what
the public wants is not being allowed
on the floor by his leadership when he
was the whip, by this leadership, and
now he wants to get well with a bill
that is very small.
Open up the floor to debate. We will
debate all the big things that will real-
ly reduce prices, which people want,
and we will debate his bill. I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I point
out to my friend from New York, I am
not the leader or the floor manager of
legislation. That is up to Senator
MCCONNELL, the Senator from Ken-
tucky. Obviously, there has been foot-
dragging on important things like ap-
propriations bills, the USMCA—the im-
portant trade agreement with Canada
and Mexico—and now there is impeach-
ment mania that has consumed the
House of Representatives and has
crowded out our ability to get other
things done; hence, my loss of patience
after waiting since June to get this bill
passed.
This isn’t a case of my wanting to
get well; this is a case of wanting to
make the American people well by pro-
viding them access to low-cost generic
alternative drugs and preventing Big
Pharma from engaging in the sorts of
gamesmanship that keep drug prices up
and keep the American consumer
down.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak as in

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

HEALTHCARE
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this
morning, or I guess this afternoon, to
talk about a couple of issues. I will
start with healthcare and talk about
the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program, as well as another piece of
legislation we are considering in the
next couple of days.
Let me start with healthcare. There
is a lot to talk about here. We don’t
have time for all of it today, but a
number of things are happening on the
healthcare front that I think most
Americans are aware of but maybe
have not heard a lot about recently.
I would argue there are three basic
threats to healthcare right now—not
just healthcare for some but, in large
measure, healthcare for all. One is a
lawsuit, which is being litigated in the
Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. It is a
lawsuit that would wipe out the Afford-
able Care Act, and that lawsuit has al-
ready prevailed at the district court
level. It is now before the appellate
court, and if that lawsuit were to pre-
vail, the Affordable Care Act—or I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6969
December 11, 2019
should say it by its full name—the Pa-
tient Protection and Affordable Care
Act would be declared unconstitu-
tional. That would have ramifications
not only for those 20 million who got
covered—coverage they didn’t have be-
fore—but also the tens of millions who
have protections they never had before
the act was passed in 2010.
If you have a preexisting condition,
for example—roughly, one out of two
Americans has a preexisting condi-
tion—if you have one, you should be
very concerned about the result of that
lawsuit, the determination of which
could be made in a matter of days or
weeks. That is a big threat. That is the
biggest threat to healthcare for vir-
tually every American or at least every
American family.
The second big threat to healthcare
is what the administration has under-
taken since day one of the Trump ad-
ministration, and that is the sabotage
of the existing system in this regard,
especially with respect to the insur-
ance exchanges. What the administra-
tion has done is try to take adminis-
trative action, action by agencies
under the President’s jurisdiction, to
undermine the exchanges.
How do they do that? Well, they cut
the advertising. So when they adver-
tise to say that you can shop for a
health insurance plan on the ex-
changes, they cut the advertising budg-
et by 90 percent. They left 10 percent
there. I guess we are supposed to be
happy with that.
So they cut advertising by 90 per-
cent. Then they started attacking the
contracts for navigators. These are in-
dividuals all across the country who sit
with people and say: Let me help you
go through the options you might have
for purchasing insurance or changing
your insurance plan.
For example, right now, we are in an
open enrollment period, so folks can
change their health insurance plans
until Sunday—basically, December 15.
It would be nice to have a navigator—
an assistant, in a sense—sitting next to
you if you are making those decisions
about your healthcare.
So threat No. 1 to healthcare is the
lawsuit; threat No. 2 is the sabotage;
and threat No. 3 has not quite played
out yet, but I don’t know a Member of
the House or the Senate in the Repub-
lican caucus in either Chamber who is
not against the threat—the cuts to
Medicare and Medicaid proposed by the
administration.
I thought it was bad when the admin-
istration—or I should say, House Re-
publicans—back in the spring of 2018
proposed a cut of $1 trillion to the Med-
icaid Program over 10 years. That was
bad enough. That was dangerous
enough. But the administration went
further than that. The administra-
tion’s proposal and, I have to say, un-
less it is contradicted, the official posi-
tion of Republican Members of Con-
gress is a 10-year cut to Medicaid of
$11⁄2 trillion—$11⁄2 trillion. That means
the official Republican position in Con-
gress—unless they say they disagree
with the President, and I haven’t heard
any Member say that yet—is that the
Medicaid Program should be cut by
$150 billion each and every year for 10
years. That is the proposed cut. That is
Medicaid.
By the way, Medicaid is the kids’ dis-
abilities and nursing home program,
for shorthand. Most of the people
helped by Medicaid are folks in nursing
homes, low-income children, children
from low-income families, and children
with disabilities who have a substan-
tial stake in this.
When you consider those three
threats—the lawsuit, the sabotage, and
the budget cuts—all are bad news, but
then when you start getting into the
details of each, you realize one aspect
of this, which I wanted to raise today,
and that is the adverse impact on chil-
dren.
We are told by the Georgetown Uni-
versity Health Policy Institute Center
for Children and Families—I am hold-
ing up a November 2019 summary of a
report, a back and a front. I will not
read all of it and I will not enter it into
the RECORD because there is a lot of de-
tail here that we probably can’t enter
into the RECORD. I do want to read into
the RECORD a couple of highlights from
it, though. These folks have been doing
research on children’s health insurance
for many years and have spent their
lives working on this. The headline
reads ‘‘The Number of Uninsured Chil-
dren is on the Rise.’’
The United States of America, which
finally, decades after passing the Med-
icaid Program, which was a great ad-
vancement in children’s health insur-
ance, then added to that with the en-
actment in the 1990s of the Children’s
Health Insurance Program—it had the
letter ‘‘S’’ before it, the SCHIP pro-
gram—which really was adopting pro-
grams that have been adopted in my
home State of Pennsylvania and a few
others.
That same country which made a
great advancement for children’s
health with Medicaid—tens of millions
of kids—then made a greater advance-
ment with the Children’s Health Insur-
ance Program and then made even
more substantial gains when we passed
the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act and substantially drove down
the number of uninsured Americans.
Basically what happened was that
about 20 million people got healthcare
coverage in about 6 years—not even a
decade. A number of those Americans
were children.
As we were substantially driving
down the uninsured rate, what has hap-
pened in the last 2 years? The unin-
sured rate is going up. The Census Bu-
reau told us in September that the un-
insured rate is going up by 2 million
people—to be exact, 1.9 million people.
A big share of the 1.9 million people
who are now uninsured—that number is
going up instead of down, as it had
been for most of the decade—a lot of
those are children.
Here is a summary of finding No. 1 in
this report by the Georgetown Univer-
sity Health Policy Institute Center for
Children and Families, November 2019.
It is by Joan Alker and Lauren
Roygardner. ‘‘The number of uninsured
children in the United States increased
by more than 400,000 between 2016 and
2018, bringing the total to over 4 mil-
lion uninsured children in the nation.’’
That same Nation which made great
advancements by lowering the number
of uninsured children is now going in
the wrong direction.
Finding No. 2: ‘‘These coverage losses
are widespread, with 15 states showing
statistically significant increases in
the number and/or the rate of unin-
sured children.’’
The following States are listed: Ala-
bama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho,
Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Montana,
North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee,
Texas, Utah, and West Virginia. That
is significant. Those States are rep-
resented in some cases by two Demo-
cratic Senators, sometimes two Repub-
lican Senators, and sometimes Sen-
ators of both parties. So it is hap-
pening in a widespread fashion. The
rate of uninsured children is going up.
Finding No. 3: ‘‘Loss of coverage is
most pronounced for white children
and Latino children (some of which
may fall into both categories).’’
The other category where the num-
ber is going up substantially is younger
children, under the age of 6. So we are
not just talking about children losing
coverage; we are talking about that
number being more pronounced for
children under the age of 6.
This also includes children in low- to
moderate-income families who earn be-
tween 138 percent and 250 percent of
the poverty level, meaning a little
more than 29,000 bucks to 53,000 bucks
annually—‘‘bucks’’ is my word, not the
report’s word—$29,435 to $53,325 annu-
ally for a family of three. So these
folks who are struggling in a lot of
ways—low-income families trying to
climb that ladder to get to the middle
class, in many cases working two or
three jobs, trying to make ends meet—
at least in many cases, their children
had coverage, and now children in
those families are losing coverage.
Point No. 4 and the last point:
‘‘States that have not expanded Med-
icaid to parents and other adults under
the Affordable Care Act have seen in-
creases in their rate of uninsured chil-
dren three times as large as states that
have,’’ meaning States that expanded
Medicaid. The expansion of Medicaid
was part of that advancement I talked
about.
The three threats to healthcare are
bad enough. It is especially bad when
you consider that the Americans who
are carrying the heaviest burden of
that uninsured rate going up are, in
fact, children.
The second thing I want to raise is
the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program. We had a great effort under-
taken in the 2018 farm bill. There were

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

efforts by some to cut the Supple-
mental Nutrition Assistance Program,
which we used to know as food stamps.
Fortunately, those efforts to cut the
program and to knock people off of the
SNAP program were unsuccessful.
We came together in a bipartisan ef-
fort in both the House and the Senate,
and the President signed it into the
law just about a year ago—December
2018. The ink was barely dry on his sig-
nature when his administration and
the Department of Agriculture started
to think of other ways to do the same
thing to SNAP they couldn’t do by way
of legislation.
So where are we? Well, we have had
basically three proposals over the
course of the last year by the adminis-
tration that would take 4 million peo-
ple out of the SNAP program, kick 4
million people off the program.
Here is what one of those proposals
would do: According to the U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture’s own esti-
mates, the proposed changes to one
part of SNAP called categorical eligi-
bility would eliminate millions from
the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program, and it could also leave nearly
1 million children without access to
free school meals. I don’t know about
everyone here, but I think that is a
step in the wrong direction.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assist-
ance Program is important not only for
those families—many of them working
families, many of them with a child in
the household who needs food assist-
ance, who faces food insecurity without
SNAP—many of those same families
might have a child and an individual
with a disability in the same household
or one or the other. That is the SNAP
program.
By the way, everyone else in the
country benefits when people spend
those SNAP dollars because when you
provide those dollars and folks buy
food, guess what happens. You guessed
it. The economy gets a jump-start from
that activity. The SNAP program isn’t
about just the people who are directly
benefiting. I think we have an obliga-
tion to help them, for sure. We all ben-
efit when there is economic activity.
There is more than a bang for the buck
in the SNAP program; you spend a
buck, and you get a lot more than a
buck in return.
This is all in the context of where we
are with a lot of families. We hear a lot
on the floor of this Chamber and I am
sure on the floor of the other body, the
House, about ‘‘Well, certain people
shouldn’t get this benefit,’’ and some
make an argument against that.
It is interesting that in the SNAP
program for many years now, not just
for the last couple of years, the pay-
ment error rate in that program has
been way down, the lowest levels ever.
Why? It is because of good efforts to
detect fraud, and also technology al-
lows payments to be tracked. The pay-
ment error rate is at its lowest level
ever. Yet we still have efforts under-
taken to knock people out of the pro-
gram. That is not just insulting, it is
very dangerous to people’s lives.
I hope Members of the Senate will
tell the administration to back off
those proposals that have been under-
taken to knock literally, if you have
the effect of all three proposals, 4 mil-
lion people off of the program, many of
whom are children.
This all happens in the context of
those healthcare issues I raised before.
The same child or the same family who
might have their SNAP benefits cut or
taken away might be the same family
who is losing their coverage because of
cuts to Medicaid and Medicare or be-
cause of the uninsured rate going way
up in a country that was driving it way
down. Both are happening at the same
time.
BIPARTISAN AMERICAN MINERS ACT OF 2019
Mr. President, I want to raise an-
other issue, and then I will conclude.
This is about coal miners across the
country but in particular in a couple of
States, like my home State of Pennsyl-
vania, and I know this is true of Ken-
tucky and Virginia and West Virginia,
just to name several—or I should say
the main States we are talking about
here.
The Bipartisan American Miners Act
of 2019, S. 2788—I know Senator
MANCHIN and others have spoken about
this. We are trying to get this legisla-
tion or some version of this passed by
the end of this year. I won’t go through
all the details of the legislation, but it
attempts to help on the miners’ pen-
sion issue—and these are obviously re-
tired coal miners—as well as the
healthcare for those same miners,
those same families.
I will make a comment about what
this means. Many of those same fami-
lies had to wait way too long—several
years—before this body acted to pro-
vide a measure of relief to some of
those retired miners on healthcare.
The job isn’t done yet on healthcare
but even more so on pensions.
The point I have always made here is
that our government made a promise
to them decades ago. In fact, it was the
time when President Truman was in of-
fice in the late 1940s. We made a prom-
ise to coal miners at that time.
In that whole intervening time pe-
riod, those decades, they kept their
promises. Many of them were sent
overseas to fight in wars, from World
War II, to Korea, to Vietnam and be-
yond. They kept their promise to the
country by fighting for their country.
They kept their promise to their em-
ployer by going to work every day in
the most dangerous job in the world,
likely. I am not sure there is one that
is more dangerous. They kept their
promise to their families to go to work
and to support them, sometimes on
that one income of a coal miner.
In my home area of Northeastern
Pennsylvania, the novelist Stephen
Crane—he is known for the ‘‘Red Badge
of Courage,’’ but what he is not known
for as much is an essay he wrote about
coal mining in the late 1800s—1890s to
be exact. He described all the ways a
coal miner could die in a coal mine. He
described the coal mine as a place of
inscrutable darkness, a soundless place
of tangible loneliness, and then walked
through the ways a miner could die.
I know we have advanced from the
1890s—thank God we have—but there
are still coal miners in the recent his-
tory of this country who have lost
their lives. All they have asked us to
do—they haven’t asked us to come up
with some new fancy plan for them and
their families; all they have asked us
to do is to have this government—the
executive branch and the legislative
branch—keep the promise to coal min-
ers and their families with regard to
healthcare and pensions. Both of those
parts of our policy are promises.
So when we work on this between
now and the end of the year to try to
find a solution, we will be only meeting
that basic obligation of keeping our
promise to retired coal miners and
their families like they kept their
promise to their country.
I yield the floor.

NEY). The Senator from Kansas.
TRIBUTE TO KELLY MCMANUS
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, today, I
want to take a moment to recognize
the contributions of Kelly McManus.
She is a member of my staff. She is
U.S. Army MAJ Kelly McManus, who
has spent the last year working in my
personal office as part of the U.S.
Army Congressional Fellowship Pro-
gram.
Before Kelly departs my office here
at the end of the year to return to the
Big Army, I rise to express my appre-
ciation to Major McManus for all of her
hard work and dedication and service
to our Nation.
Kelly’s 10 years of service in the U.S.
Army have developed her leadership
abilities and shaped her perspective on
major defense issues of national sig-
nificance. These assets and attributes
have made her an invaluable asset to
our team as we work to serve Kansans,

Before joining our office, Kelly’s as-
signments had taken her around the
world in service of our country. She de-
ployed to both Iraq and Kuwait to sup-

medical planner for the Allied Land
Command in NATO headquarters in
Izmir, Turkey, and reported to Wies-

Kelly has also served stateside, lead-

Hurricane Sandy relief efforts and
commanded a medical company in the
2nd Infantry Division at Joint Base
Lewis-McChord in Washington State.
Kelly joined our team in January

military installations and talked with
soldiers and airmen to learn about
their life experiences. She made it a
priority to spend time in Kansas and to
learn from the Kansas people so that
she could bring their thoughts and
ideas back to the Nation’s Capital.
These personal conversations with
Kansans and Kelly’s experience in the
Army have helped to drive meaningful
policy.
She led our efforts to secure mater-
nity leave for those serving in the Na-
tional Guard and Reserve after talking
with an expectant mother in the Kan-
sas National Guard. She has also
sought to increase access to suicide
prevention programs and destigmatize
the notions surrounding mental illness.
In addition, her experiences in serv-
ing in uniform have been instrumental
to my efforts to support our veterans.
Over the past year, I have continually
been impressed by Kelly’s leadership
and professionalism. At every oppor-
tunity, she has proven herself to be an
important and fully integrated member
of my team, carrying the equal weight
and responsibility of my personal staff.
Her seamless communications and her
skill in tackling issues big and small
have been a great benefit to our office
and the people that we serve. Kelly has
exceeded all of my expectations and
has demonstrated a commitment to ex-
cellence that has been nothing short of
outstanding.
A testament to her leadership over
the past year was her promotion to
major in July. It was my honor to be
part of her promotion ceremony and to
have the privilege to pin her new and
deserving rank on her uniform.
It will be sad when she leaves our of-
fice at the end of the month, but I
know she will serve the Army well next
year in the Army’s Budget Liaison Of-
fice, where I am confident she will be a
highly effective ambassador to Con-
gress for the Army.
Kelly is one of the most impressive
military officers I have had the honor
of knowing, and I hold her in the high-
est regard, personally and profes-
sionally. She is a significant asset to
our country and to the U.S. Army.
Kelly represents the best that the
Army has to offer, and I know that she
will continue to be a benefit to the fu-
ture of our Nation. There is no group of
people I hold in higher regard than
those who serve our Nation, and I want
to reiterate my gratitude to Kelly for
her dedication and service to our coun-
try.
Once again, thank you, Kelly, for all
you have done for Kansans this year
and what you will continue to do for
our Nation. You have been a model of
selfless service and leadership. I know
you will continue to do great things
throughout your Army career and your
life in service, wherever that path my
lead you.

REMEMBERING BERKLEY BEDELL
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I
come to the floor today to pay tribute
to an extraordinary Iowan with whom I
shared a decades-long friendship—a
very prominent Democrat from my
State.
Over this past weekend, former Iowa
Congressman Berkley Bedell passed
away at the age of 98. For nearly a cen-
tury of life, Berkley took his grand-
mother’s advice to heart: ‘‘You can do
almost anything within reason if you
will only set your mind to it.’’
From an early age, Berkley Bedell
set his mind to a high standard of
achievement. He set an example for the
rest of us. He practiced what he
preached and he made a difference in
this world.
As a child raised during the Great
Depression, Berkley became a soldier
in the U.S. Army. He was, obviously, a
World War II veteran, an entrepreneur,
a job creator, a philanthropist, a policy
influencer, and, most of all, a devoted
husband and father.
What I left out is how I got ac-
quainted with him. He was a fellow
Member of the House of Representa-
tives during my early years and for
some time after I came to the Senate.
Our decades-long friendship began
when Berkley and I were elected to
serve Iowans in the House of Rep-
resentatives in 1974. Soon after the ori-
entation for new Members, Barbara and
I developed a close relationship with
Elinor and Berkley. This friendship re-
mained for the next 45 years.
Looking back, those were lonely days
for a freshman Republican House Mem-
ber. That is when the Watergate scan-
dal upended the midterm elections.
Voters elected 91 new House Members
to that Congress. I happened to be the
only Republican in the Iowa congres-
sional delegation. Among our so-called
Watergate class of 1974, I was joined by
Iowans Tom Harkin, Michael Blouin,
and Berkley Bedell. We were all fresh-
man Members of Congress. We joined
then with more senior Members from
the State of Iowa—Neal Smith, who
went on to serve 36 years in the House,
and Ed Mezvinsky. The Democrat Sen-
ators from Iowa were Dick Clark and
John Culver. Berkley would go on to
represent Iowa’s Sixth Congressional
District for six terms, from 1975 to 1987.
Even though he lived about another 32
years after that, I presume he would
have served a lot longer if his health
had held out.
Although Berkley and I didn’t share
the same political points of view, we
did share a common approach for rep-
resentative government, meaning with
dialogue and feedback from Iowans
that was very necessary if we were
going to represent them properly. Most
often, the forums for that were our re-
spective townhall meetings.
Throughout our service together in
Congress, party labels didn’t displace
our ability to work with and for
Iowans. As one example, during the
farm crisis of the 1980s, which was
much worse than this farm crisis we
have right now, we used our voices to
raise public awareness and steer help
to struggling farm communities in our
home State. We did everything possible
to shape farm policy and restore hope
to thousands of farm families who were
coping with double-digit inflation and
with the farm debt crisis.
As a Federal lawmaker, Berkley took
his oversight work seriously. Even
though I take oversight seriously, I
didn’t do it in quite the way he did. His
was kind of an unorthodox approach.
He just ventured, willy-nilly, into a
Federal bureaucracy here or a Federal
bureaucracy over there. He took the
liberty of dropping by in person at
these agencies. He would go up to peo-
ple and ask: What is your job? I don’t
know exactly the questions he asked,
but in knowing Berkley the way I did,
I think he probably wanted to have
very calm conversations with them to
determine what they did and maybe
even see if they were doing it right,
particularly if they were spending the
taxpayers’ money right. He did this to
keep tabs on how these Federal em-
ployees in these various bureaucracies
were serving the Nation and, particu-
larly, serving Iowans. Now, that is
what I would call an in-the-flesh gut
check—a very different type of over-
sight from what I have done.
Berkley was born in Spirit Lake, IA.
I assume he lived his entire life in Spir-
it Lake, IA, except for the period of
time he was in the military and until
he spent some retirement time in Flor-
ida. Spirit Lake, IA, is a close-knit
farming community in Dickinson
County. His neck of the woods is lo-
cated in the Iowa Great Lakes region—
a regional destination for fishing, boat-
ing, and outdoor recreation. I will bet
the Presiding Officer has been there
many times.
The area is fondly known as the Uni-
versity of Okoboji, where generations
of families go year after year to vaca-
tion and enjoy life. By the way, the
University of Okoboji is not really a
university but is very much a selling
point for that part of the State, from
an economic development point of
view, and it has worked very success-
fully.
As I just described, this is where
Berkley’s insatiable work ethic took
root. It guided him for his nearly 100
years of life on Earth. Through philan-
thropic good works, he leaves behind a
legacy of conservation, stewardship,
and historic preservation. With his
wife, he helped to launch the Okoboji
Foundation more than three decades
ago. Since then, the foundation has
awarded millions of dollars to scores of
nonprofit organizations in that lakes
region of Iowa.

S6972 December 11, 2019
In other words, Berkley believed in
paying it forward. He cared deeply
about giving back to his community
for future generations to enjoy. As you
would expect an Iowan to do, he rolled
up his sleeves, opened his wallet, and
pitched in to make a difference. By my
measure, his represents a life well
lived, and he lived life well.
As I mentioned earlier, Berkley and
Elinor became steadfast friends with
Barbara and this Senator. We shared
an abiding mutual respect, and we
cherished their gracious regard for that
friendship. After the Bedells moved to
Florida in their retirement, Barbara
and I enjoyed an annual gift from the
Bedells each February. It was a very
simple annual gift but one that had a
lot of meaning to it—more than the
material it represented. They sent us a
box of oranges from their home in the
Sunshine State. Just as regularly as a
clock, we received these over many,
many years.
Through these many years, their an-
nual Christmas letter was something
that we looked forward to. In many
years, in personal notes in those very
letters, they even thanked us for our
friendship. Berkley also stayed in
touch with a friendly Valentine note
each year to Barbara, my wife. With
Berkley’s passing, we are saddened to
know that these tokens of friendship
have now come to an end.
Berkley’s story is an inspiration for
younger generations of Americans who
are pursuing their dreams. It is never
too early to dream big. This was how
Berkley Bedell was dreaming as a 16-
year-old: He became an entrepreneur.
Berkley launched a fishing tackle busi-
ness with Jack, his brother. It was
called the Berkley Fly Company. I am
told he started the company with $50
from paper route money. He started
tying fly fishing lures in his bedroom.
Pouring years of sweat equity into
the family business boosted the local
economy and created jobs in his be-
loved Iowa Great Lakes. His tenacious
leadership developed a strong work-
force for what was then called Berkley
Industries. That company, which is
now called Pure Fishing, is today one
of the leading fishing tackle manufac-
turers in the world.
At 98 years young, Berkley didn’t let
age slow him down by any stretch of
the imagination. He remained active in
public policymaking and immersed in
electoral politics in Iowa. Usually, at
least once a year, he called on me here
in Washington, in the Hart Office
Building, to tell me about some legisla-
tive issue he was interested in, and we
worked together on some of those leg-
islative issues. Everything here in
Washington is so political, so this may
sound very unusual, and maybe it is
unusual today: Despite our differences
in political philosophies—he was a
Democrat; I am a Republican—we both
appreciated how crucial it was to en-
gage the next generation in civic life.
Berkley’s leadership and legacy will
be remembered for generations to
come. I am proud to have called him a
very good, good friend.
Barbara and I extend our condolences
to his sons, Ken and Tom, and to Jo-
anne, his daughter.
Your dad made a big footprint in his
life’s journey.
As my former colleague in the House
of Representatives, Berkley later be-
came my constituent when I was elect-
ed to serve here in the U.S. Senate. I
never knew Berkley Bedell to stop ad-
vocating for his community or for the
good of our Nation. It became Berk-
ley’s lifelong hallmark to leave God’s
green Earth better than he had found it
for generations to come.
I wish Godspeed to my good friend
Berkley Bedell, who joins Elinor, his
beloved wife, in eternal life.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic whip.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was in
my office and just learned, by Senator
GRASSLEY’s floor speech, about the
passing of Berkley Bedell, and I just
wanted to add my voice to his.
He was a wonderful man. I served
with him in the House of Representa-
tives. Spirit Lake was his home area in
Iowa. He was a really knowledgeable
man when it came to issues of agri-
culture, and I didn’t learn until many
years later that he was a very success-
ful businessman in the fishing tackle
business, if I remember correctly, and
sporting goods. He had many interests.
He was a spirited, friendly, good per-
son who worked hard at his job and was
a credit to the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives, regardless of party, and I
think Senator GRASSLEY’s remarks re-
flect that.
I am going to miss his annual Christ-
mas card. He and his wife—she passed
away just recently, as well—would send
a card about the comings and goings of
their big, old family. It was a big over-
sized card, and I always looked forward
to it.
I feel honored to have been able to
serve with him. I thank my colleague
and friend Senator GRASSLEY from
Iowa for paying tribute to him.
Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak for 2 min-
utes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
THE WORLD BANK AND CHINA
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last
week, despite the objections of the
United States, the World Bank adopted
a plan for lending more than $1 billion
annually to China.
China is the world’s second largest
economy, and its per capita income is
well above the level at which countries
are supposed to graduate from needing
World Bank assistance. American tax
dollars should not be used, even indi-
rectly, for lending to wealthier coun-
tries, particularly when they violate
human rights.
China seeks legitimacy through
international institutions for its bad
practices, including for its own preda-
tory lending through the Belt and Road
Initiative. Despite what the recent
World Bank Group’s Country Partner-
ship Framework reads, China is not an
example developing countries should
follow.
To sum up on this point, China has
the second largest economy in the
world, and it still wants to be consid-
ered a developing country and lend tax-
payers’ dollars around the world in
order for there to be a greater Com-
munist influence. As taxpayers, we
should not stand for that to happen.
78TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ATTACK ON PEARL
HARBOR
Mr. President, on another point, this
past weekend marked the 78th anniver-
sary of Japan’s attack on Pearl Har-
bor—a raid that plunged the United
States into World War II. Almost 2,500
U.S. soldiers lost their lives that day.
I am proud of the many Iowans who
have served and sacrificed for our great
country. Earlier this year, three of
these people returned to Iowa to be laid
to rest—Robert J. Bennett, William L.
Kvidera, and Bert E. McKeeman.
I honor them and all of our service-
members for their sacrifices in serving
our people, protecting our constitu-
tional rights and the freedom and lib-
erties we have.
I yield the floor.
NOMINATION OF STEPHEN HAHN
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am
going to take a chance this afternoon
and vote for one of the President’s
nominees. Some of my colleagues have
come up to me and said I am making a
big mistake, and I hope I am not.
His name is Stephen Hahn. He is a
medical doctor and an oncologist from
MD Anderson in Texas, and he has been
named to serve as the Food and Drug
Administration Commissioner.
This is a relatively small agency by
Federal standards that has a major-size
impact on the lives of Americans and
beyond. I think it is one of our most
important agencies. It regulates so
many things relating to safety and
quality of life, and Dr. Hahn would
come to this position at an auspicious
moment in our history.
I refer, of course, to the fact that we
are now battling a vaping epidemic
across the United States of America.
The Presiding Officer, from Utah, and
I have worked on this together, and I
thank him for his leadership in this re-
gard.
I look at Dr. Hahn and I think of all
the questions that I have asked him. I
had a face-to-face meeting with him in
my office and then had him on the
phone last night for another half hour,
and he was very patient in answering
my questions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6973
December 11, 2019
I asked him about the vaping crisis
we face, the epidemic that we face. He
readily concedes that this is something
he feels very strongly about.
The latest disclosure from the youth
tobacco report suggests that 28 percent
or more of high school students across
the United States are currently using
e-cigarettes or vaping. Yesterday, I had
a group of high school students from
New York who asked to see me, and
they said: Senator, you are wrong. It is
over half.
A majority of the students in high
school now are using JUUL devices, or
vaping devices, and these flavors, and
they have developed nicotine addic-
tions, which have become controlling
in their lives and it affects the way
they feel and the way they perform as
students.
That is why it is so important, from
my point of view, for Dr. Hahn to make
this a major priority. He assured me
that he would. He reminded me that he
is a lung cancer doctor, and we had a
long conversation about my father,
who died of that disease, and tobacco
and the impact it had on his life. I felt
sincerity on the part of the doctor
when he was discussing this.
We talked about working with Dr.
Azar, who has been an ally in this con-
versation about controlling vaping de-
vices and cigarettes.
He said that regardless of how I voted
for him, he would look forward to
working with me. I am going to vote
for him as the new FDA Commissioner.
It is a leap of faith because I am not
certain where the President of the
United States is at this moment.
The Presiding Officer was at a meet-
ing a couple of weeks ago in the White
House, and I have commended him for
the questions he asked there, hoping to
hold the President and First Lady to
their promise of September 15 to really
take on this epidemic of vaping and e-
cigarettes. I don’t know at this mo-
ment whether he is going to continue
in that effort or whether the vaping in-
dustry has diverted him to a different
point of view.
Dr. Hahn may find himself in a com-
promised position soon, and I told him
as much. If it comes to the point where
the President has abandoned his effort
against vaping and the industry is
going to prevail, then, I am afraid that
Dr. Hahn is going to be wearing the
collar for some of the things that fol-
low. Even though he may not even
agree with the President’s conclusion,
he will be working for the President as
part of his administration.
Dr. Hahn said to me: I don’t want to
be known in history as the head of the
FDA who saw this epidemic grow dra-
matically when it comes to vaping by
young people.
I am going to give him my vote, and
I do it with the hope that he will have
a persuasive voice with Dr. Azar and
the administration to move in the
right direction.
I applauded President Trump—which
is unusual from my side of the aisle—
when he made his initial decision to
take action against e-cigarettes, and I
would like to applaud him again. I hope
he will resume this effort. I hope the
First Lady, who rarely gets engaged in
issues but seems to feel very strongly
about this, will join us in persuading
the President to keep true to his prom-
ise of September 15.
I will be supporting Dr. Hahn’s nomi-
nation for FDA Commissioner.
REMEMBERING THE REVEREND DR. CLAY EVANS
Mr. President, last Friday night was
an amazing evening. I went to the Fel-
lowship Missionary Baptist Church on
the South Side of Chicago, not too far
from where the White Sox play base-
ball.
There was a Friday night memorial
service for the longtime pastor of that
church, the Reverend Clay Evans. He
actually divided the service up and
said, Friday night is for the politicians
and government people; Saturday
morning will be the memorial service
for the members of the church. A lot of
people showed up on Friday night be-
cause a lot of us considered Clay Evans
to be a friend.
He was more than a friend. He was a
legend. The Reverend Clay Evans died
peacefully at his home the day before
Thanksgiving at the age of 94. Let me
tell you a little bit about him.
If you ever had the good fortune to
witness the Reverend Dr. Clay Evans
preach, you were lucky. With his rous-
ing sermons, his soulful baritone voice
and ‘‘the Ship,’’ which is what he
called the legendary Fellowship Mis-
sionary Baptist Church choir behind
him, Reverend Evans was mesmerizing.
His sermons gave hope to the down-
hearted. His singing could bring you to
your feet. His Sunday services were so
moving and so uplifting that the leg-
endary Sam Cooke used to come and
attend for inspiration.
Even in Chicago, the birthplace of
modern Black gospel music, the home
of Mahalia Jackson, James Cleveland,
Mavis Staples, and so many others, the
Reverend Clay Evans stood out for the
power of his preaching.
But it wasn’t just his beautiful voice
that drew people in. Clay Evans was a
man of faith, integrity, and moral
courage. In the 1960s, he helped per-
suade Dr. Martin Luther King to come
to Chicago and use it as his base as Dr.
King sought to expand the civil rights
movement. It was not a popular posi-
tion at the time, believe me.
Chicago power brokers, fearful of the
unrest in the streets, warned Black
ministers: Don’t let Dr. King into your
churches. Many of them listened to
that warning and turned him away—
not Clay Evans.
He invited Dr. King to speak at his
church. He opened the doors of the
‘‘Ship’’ to Operation Breadbasket, the
Southern Christian Leadership Con-
ference’s economic justice project.
Then, he persuaded other Chicago min-
isters and churches to join him.
He paid a price for it. Offers of con-
struction loans he needed to build his
church were withdrawn when he made
this controversial decision. Building
permits were withheld for several
years.
But Chicago, over time, became more
just. Thanks to the work of Reverend
Evans, Dr. Martin Luther King, and the
man whom Evans ordained, the Rev-
erend Jesse Jackson, and many others,
Operation Breadbasket helped to open
up thousands of jobs for Black
Chicagoans in previously all-White gro-
cery chains and companies.
Years ago, Reverend Evans told a
Chicago Tribune reporter: ‘‘I try to em-
body the principles of Christianity, and
for me that means being dedicated to
freedom and equality.’’ For him, faith
was not just what you believed; it was
the way he lived.
Clay Evans was born in 1925 into a
large, church-going family in Browns-
ville, TN. His family were share-
croppers. He was one of nine kids. At
night, he liked to listen to jazz music
on the radio.
He moved to Chicago in 1945, part of
the Great Migration that has enriched
that city in so many ways.
The most successful man he knew in
Brownsville, TN, was an undertaker,
and that is what Clay Evans thought
he would become in Chicago, but he
couldn’t afford the tuition for mor-
tuary school. He took jobs where he
found them. He worked at a pickle fac-
tory, as a window washer. He drove a
truck delivering pies. He was working
at the Brass Rail cocktail lounge in
downtown Chicago when they prompt-
ed him to join in song and marveled at
his voice. He might have been a suc-
cessful nightclub performer, but he felt
called to the ministry.
He attended the Chicago Baptist In-
stitute and was ordained a Baptist
minister in 1950. He would later study
at both the Northern Baptist Theo-
logical Seminary and the University of
Chicago Divinity School.
He founded the Fellowship Mis-
sionary Baptist Church in 1958 and
served as pastor for 42 years. He used
radio and later TV to bring his min-
istry to homes throughout the Midwest
and South and to introduce Black gos-
pel music to the Nation.
Fellowship Missionary Baptist
Church, or ‘‘The Ship,’’ as it is affec-
tionately known, quickly became one
of the most influential churches in Chi-
cago.
He helped to launch the careers of
nearly 90 up-and-coming young min-
isters, including Mother Consuella
York, the first woman to be ordained a
Baptist minister in the city of Chicago.
He ordained the Reverend Jesse
Jackson, and, in 1971, the two ministers
cofounded Operation PUSH to encour-
age African-American self-help.
Carved into his wooden pulpit was
one of his favorite sayings: It is no se-
cret what God can do. What God did
through his servant Clay Evans helped
to increase hope and justice in Chicago
and far beyond.

Congressman, I made my early trips to

Chicago to meet the movers and the
shakers. Reverend Clay Evans was high
on that list, and, as luck would have it,
at one of the dinners we were seated
next to one another. He leaned over to
me—I knew exactly who he was—and
he said: Congressman, I am Reverend
Clay Evans.
I said: That is not what I heard. I
heard you are Reverend Chicago.
He laughed and he looked down. He
said: Well, they call me that from time
to time.
That is the kind of respect that he
commanded, not just because of his
ministry but also because he was such
an integral part of the faith scene in
that big city.
We got to be friends, and I was al-
ways looking forward to the times we
could get together.
With a choir led by his sister, Lou
Della Evans-Reid, Pastor Evans pro-
duced and recorded over 40 gospel al-
bums—11 that charted on and 2 that
topped the Billboard Gospel Albums
Chart.
His first No. 1 gospel hit was called
‘‘I’m Going Through,’’ released in 1993.
The title song talks about staying on
the righteous road, no matter how
steep the climb, how large the obsta-
cles.
Reverend Evans would sing:
I’m going through. I’m going through no
matter what they may do. The world behind,
heaven in view, I’m going through.
The Reverend Clay Evans walked
that righteous road. He overcame ob-
stacles and widened the road so others
could follow. He is certainly going to
be missed, and the crowd of speakers
Friday night is just evidence of the
many lives that he touched.
My wife Loretta and I want to offer
our condolences to his wife of nearly 74
years, Lutha Mae, their children, their
grandchildren, and their great-grand-
children, and all of those in the family
of Clay Evans who tried to maintain a
warm smile at a time of sadness for
many of them.
What he has left behind is something
that we will all point to for years to
come.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri.
FEDERAL REGULATIONS
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, on Mon-
day I spoke at the annual meeting of
the Missouri Farm Bureau, and, in our
State, as in, frankly, almost every
other State, the No. 1 economic activ-
ity in terms of value produced is agri-
culture.
Where we live in the middle of the
country, we do better in an economy
that focuses on growing things and
making things than we do on an econ-
omy that focuses more on giving ad-
vice—not that we don’t want to give a
lot of advice, but the truth is we don’t
want to get a lot of advice, either.
So there is nothing wrong with a
service-based economy, and there is
nothing wrong with an important serv-
ice sector in our economy, but Amer-
ica, in so many ways, was built on a
productive economy, on an economy
that produced something and some-
thing tangible. I think we have a
chance to see those things happen
again.
Where we are located, almost exactly
in the middle of the country, the Mis-
sissippi River Valley is the biggest
piece of contiguous agricultural land in
the world. Compared to the near com-
petitors in size, it is the only one of
them that has its own built-in, natural
transportation center.
In fact, there are more miles of navi-
gable river in the Mississippi River
Valley than in the rest of the world put
together. I didn’t say more river than
the rest of the world put together be-
cause that wouldn’t be true, but more
miles of river that you can actually
navigate—river you can use as an ave-
nue of transportation and commerce
than everywhere else in the world put
together.
For an economy that is trying to
reach out to the world or trying to effi-
ciently compete, that is a big advan-
tage.
So at the Farm Bureau meeting, at
least three of the things the people I
talked to were most interested in were
regulation, transportation, and trade.
When it comes to regulation, Mis-
souri farm families understand that
many of the best things that have hap-
pened to them in the past 3 years have
been the things that didn’t happen.
There was a terrible regulation pro-
posed—waters of the U.S.—in which the
EPA was trying to decide that their
authority over navigable water would
be authority over all the water. Sud-
denly, navigable water had become,
under the Obama EPA, any water that
could run into any water that could
run into any water that could run into
any water that eventually would run
into navigable water. If that is how we
want to define it, the Congress should
decide that, not the EPA.
I stood on this floor many times dur-
ing that terrifying time when the EPA
was about to take over anything that
related to water, from the new side-
walk in front of your house to whether
you pave your driveway to whether you
could set a utility pole without EPA
approval.
With the Farm Bureau map of Mis-
souri, I think 99.7 percent of our State
would have met the new EPA defini-
tion of the water the EPA would regu-
late. The other 0.3 percent, I think,
were sinkholes that went directly back
into the middle of the Earth. So vir-
tually 100 percent of all Missourians
would have been affected by that.
It would have slowed the economy in
an incredible way because the EPA
could never have exercised effectively
the jurisdiction they were asking for.
The good news is, it didn’t happen.
The Trump administration moved
forward with a Clean Water Act that
made more sense. They listened to
rural America. They listened to the
people who build houses, to the people
who provide power, and to the people
who provide jobs, and they said: We are
not going to go in that direction.
Then there was the Obama Clean
Power Plan, which sounds like a good
thing. Clean power—I am not opposed
to that, and I don’t know anybody who
is. We want power to be as clean as you
can reasonably expect it to be. But the
Obama Clean Power Plan was so ag-
gressive in its approach that where I
live, the average utility bill at home
and at work would have doubled in
about 10 years.
Well, lots of things work at today’s
utility rate—or some gradual increase
of today’s utility rate—that just frank-
ly wouldn’t work if the utility bill dou-
bled.
That didn’t happen either. In fact, we
reversed course, and there is now an af-
fordable clean energy rule making its
way into law and regulation that really
understands that.
Again, if you at home write your
utility check and then write it out of
your checkbook again, a lot of things
that you would do at your house you
wouldn’t be able to do if you had to pay
your utility bill twice. Frankly, the job
you may have may not be there if you
had to pay your utility bill twice.
Also, when thinking about making
something in America today—and I
think there is a lot of interest in bring-
ing manufacturing that has gone over-
seas back to this country for lots of
reasons, but when you think about
making something in America today,
the first question you would ask your-
self would be this: Can we do what we
want to do and pay the utility bill? The
second question would be this: Does the
transportation work for what we want
to do? If the answer to either of those
questions is no, then there is no reason
to ask a third question. There is no
reason to talk about workforce. There
is no reason to talk about tax structure
in the place you are thinking about lo-
cating. There is no reason to ask any
other question if you can’t do what you
want to do, pay the utility bill, and
still have some profit.
There is no reason to talk about—if
you can’t do what you want to do—hav-
ing a transportation system that al-
lows you to do what you want to do.
Those things are critically important,
and they were critically important at
the Farm Bureau meeting. They cer-
tainly understood it takes good high-
ways, good State roads, and it takes a
strong understanding of connecting
highways, roads, railroads, and water
together that will allow you to com-
pete.
The last continuing resolution on
this issue that we passed just a few
weeks ago actually funded the fifth
year of the highway bill that was
passed 4 years ago. It provided for 5
years of authority but only 4 years of
money.
That $7.6 billion allows the transpor-
tation systems in our States and many
things in our communities to happen.
It allows county bridges to be built.

Missouri would lose $350 million in
Federal highway funds if we hadn’t fig-
ured out how to fund that fifth year,
which we did figure out just a few days
ago. Knowing that is going to happen
allows people to begin to look forward
to other things.
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA TRADE
AGREEMENT
Mr. President, on trade, I was pre-
dicting on Monday that we would get
to the USMCA before the end of the
year. I was pleased on Tuesday when it
was announced that we had an agree-
ment between the House and the ad-
ministration.
The votes had been there for a long
time to pass this, but the House had to
pass it first. So it is important to un-
derstand that the election has con-
sequences. Speaker PELOSI got to de-
cide and got to do some final negotia-
tion, but trade is important.
Trade policy, tax policy, and regu-
latory policy are the three Federal
policies that make a difference in how
competitive we are and how strong our
economy is. Certainly, when you have
our No. 1 and 2 trading partners—Mex-
ico, our No. 1 trading partner, and Can-
ada, our No. 2 trading partner—in-
volved, clearly, when they are the only
two countries that we share a border
with in the continental United States,
for the neighborhood to do well, it is
important.
What has happened in Mexico since
NAFTA is incredible. What has hap-
pened in the United States in a positive
way is also incredible. So, hopefully,
we will see the continuation of the
commitment to have a vote in the
House this year and a vote in the Sen-
ate as soon as we meet the deadlines
the law requires—the waiting periods—
once we get a bill in the Senate. A lot
of people are going to be relieved to
know that there is more certainty
about that.
TRIBUTE TO LEIGHTON GRANT
Mr. President, I also want to take a
moment today to recognize Leighton
Grant, for whom I asked earlier to have
floor privileges for the rest of this Con-
gress.
Leighton Grant has really been crit-
ical both to my work in appropriations
and in our work on foreign policy in
our office. He has handled many of our
national defense matters in the 116th
Congress.
Leighton’s 15 years of service to our
country, both in Active Duty and as a
civilian in the U.S. Air Force, have al-
lowed him to cultivate a deep under-
standing of national security issues
that affect the State of Missouri and
affect our country. His prior experience
at the Pentagon, where he worked ex-
tensively on generating the Air Force’s
budget and strategy documents, has
been particularly valuable in my work
as a defense appropriator.
The air defense of the country is crit-
ical. The appropriations decisions we
make are critical. The order we keep
them in is critical—keeping defense
lines active so that we are not stopping
and starting to meet our future needs—
so doing that in a reasonable way mat-
ters.
Leighton certainly understands that,
and he should. He joined the Air Force
in 2004 as a command and control bat-
tle management operator. He served
four deployments in Iraq and Afghani-
stan as part of the global War on Ter-
ror. He also deployed to Qatar and Jor-
dan, as well as to Latin America.
He holds a bachelor’s degree in aero-
nautics, as well as a master’s degree in
project management. While working as
our military fellow, he completed work
at the Air War College and obtained a
certificate of legislative studies at
Georgetown University.
He has contributed greatly. He has
helped support us in veteran casework,
Defense appropriations, and military
construction projects that will impact
our State.
On Sunday night, I ran into a mom
who said: I just want to thank you for
all you did to get my son out of Syria.
This was a young man who got caught
up while hiking in Syria. She knew
Leighton Grant’s name because Leigh-
ton Grant took that seriously and,
after several weeks of working, helped
to get him out of Syria. That is the
kind of thing he has helped us do. He
has worked on matters that relate to
Iran, Colombia, Australia, China, and
other areas. I am glad to have him.
I want to thank his wife Jennifer, his
daughter Marleigh, and his son Cyrus
for supporting his career as he serves
the Nation. I wish him and his family
well as they embark on a new chapter.
I hope this year of working with the
Senate and Congress, with the vast
breadth of issues he has helped us with,
turns out to be as valuable to him as
his help has been to us.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
DAINES). The clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
TAX CUT AND JOBS ACT
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, it has
been almost a year since I was sworn
in. I thought it was a good time to kind
of reminisce a little bit about the first
year of being a U.S. Senator from Indi-
ana. I want to cite that, when you
come from a place like Indiana, it is
where America really works. Think
about it. We still believe in balanced
budgets. We have rainy day funds. We
take on big issues and talk about how
we are going to pay for it, not borrow
the money, throw it on the backs of
our kids and grandkids.
So, in being here now nearly a year,
I want to reminisce back to what moti-
vated me to stick my neck out and do
it in the first place. I saw in November
of 2016 that it looked like we might
have a different dynamic here in our
U.S. Government. I look back and see,
in December of 2017, a Main Street en-
trepreneur, someone who has always
lived by those rules of stick your neck
out, take a risk. You don’t really ex-
ceed mediocrity unless you do things
that push the envelope a little bit now
and then, but do it in the context of
where it is sustainable.
I noticed, in December of 2017, we fi-
nally got some legislation across the
finish line that rewards enterprisers,
rewards Main Street USA. That was in
the Tax Cut and Jobs Act passed then.
I did not know how it was going to un-
fold. Of course, even our CBO said it
was going to end up costing the govern-
ment, not rewarding it through more
enterprise, greater revenues. Well, we
have now got some evidence from it.
We have got the hottest economy that
we have had in modern history, and,
yes, we are raising record revenues, de-
spite having lower tax rates.
Well, that sounds like the math
wouldn’t work out. Well, there is a
point, especially in small business on
Main Street, that you will not keep en-
terprising, you will not work hard if
you end up having to send too much to
a place like this that over the years did
not, to me, look like it was delivering
good value. So we have been vindi-
cated; it is working.
HEALTHCARE
Mr. President, so what else has hap-
pened in this first year? That happened
before I got here. I ran because I want-
ed to weigh in on things like the cost
of healthcare. I tackled that in my own
business back in 2008. I found a way to
make it consumer driven to where the
people that use healthcare actually
have some skin in the game.
I did it in a way I wanted to empha-
size wellness, not remediation. I tried
as a State legislator back in 2015—
served 3 years in the Indiana State
House—and realized how hard that was
going to be. I had three really good
bills that now, ironically, are pertinent
here on the main stage. I could not
even get a committee hearing. The
healthcare industry has dug in to the
point where I think, if they don’t start
embracing the fact that they need to
reform themselves, they could be under
a drastically new system.
So we had a President that was elect-
ed that wasn’t going to be happy with
business as usual. I was hoping that we
might parlay some of that into real re-
sults here. Well, we have worked a year
on trying to reform the healthcare sys-
tem, and we are really not any further
ahead than what we were a year ago.
That is because the system is digging
in and fighting it. That doesn’t mean I
am going to give up. That is kind of
bad news, other than the fact that 80
Senators have come forward to say,
Hey, you are not doing a good job. We
have got suggestions. That ought to be
a real wake-up signal that you get with
it.
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS
Mr. President, one thing we have
done here that has been immensely val-
uable is that we, as conservatives, have

been able to impact our court system,
which got lopsided over the years, to
where many laws that were passed here
get into the court system and then ei-
ther get overturned or get impacted in
ways that did not have the original in-
tent. We here in our own conference, I
think, have addressed that imbalance,
and I think here soon we will have ap-
pointed, in the 3 years that President
Trump has been at the helm, the 50th
circuit judge. That is impressive. We
are also filling slots now that we made
a change in the rules here to not only
get judges appointed but also to fill a
lot of the slots in our government that
are vacant. So that is good news.
ECONOMIC GROWTH
Mr. President, you don’t hear much
about the fact that household incomes
have increased more than $5,000 a fam-
ily in the 3 years since President
Trump was elected. It went up a total
of $1,000 in the 16 years through the
Bush and Obama administrations. That
should be the banner, the headline, and
sadly, we are mired in other discus-
sions that I will address here in a mo-
ment.
I believe in the long run that, if we
are going to change the dynamic, we
will need more disruption in an institu-
tion that, in the year I have been here,
I have been surprised how many people
come here actually wanting more, not
realizing that when you are running
trillion-dollar deficits, that is a bad
business partner. That is a business
partner that I would hedge my bets and
maybe find other ways to pay the way
in the long run. Sadly, I don’t think we
are going to fix that component until
we probably have a crisis or two, and
then we solve it in that fashion.
So the budget which is, in my opin-
ion, in the long run what we need to do
here, if we want to be helpful to the
American public, it has got to straight-
en itself out. Whether that will happen,
I do not know.
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA TRADE
AGREEMENT
Mr. President, let’s talk about some
of the things that have been occupying
time here, and let’s talk about some-
thing that looks like, finally, it is
going to get across the finish line:
USMCA. We hear about trade issues. It
is correct to be concerned about trade.
Our focus is normally on the Chinese. I
do believe this has been the time to
take them on, call them out for their
bad behavior when it comes to stealing
intellectual property, forced tech-
nology transfers, manipulating cur-
rencies, creating gluts, dumping it on
the market; no one else is doing that.
Until President Trump came along, no-
body else was talking about it. He was
over in Europe recently, reminding our
allies that, when you are running tril-
lion-dollar deficits, you can no longer
afford to be paying the bills for the rest
of the world. That is business as usual,
thank goodness, because we simply
can’t afford it anymore.
USMCA reflects arrangements be-
tween our two largest trading partners,
Canada and Mexico—many inequities
there, mostly because we were kind in
those original agreements, but it need-
ed to be changed because we cannot
sustain that in the long run. This is
going to help manufacturing. It is
going to help farmers. The number of
jobs it will create, even in this low un-
employment context, are amazing.
When you look at that, it finally gets
across the finish line, and we now, over
the next couple weeks, couple
months—who knows—we are dealing
with what is going to happen in one of
the biggest political events that has
occurred in the history of this country.
All I can tell you is we will get through
it.
I don’t think we are going to find out
any more than what we know cur-
rently, but hopefully, when we do get it
resolved, we are going to give full cred-
it due to getting tasks done like the
USMCA, lowering taxes, creating more
enterprise across this country, and
hopefully relying less on this institu-
tion in all parts of our daily lives until
it sets the example that it starts to
live within its means, live sustainably.
And then we start tackling issues like
the cost of healthcare, where we start
talking about climate, when we start
talking about the issues that future
generations will have to deal with and
that are currently paying all the bills
through the money that we are bor-
rowing, hopefully that dynamic will
change, and hopefully, we will be back
on track in November 2020 with the
leadership that has put us in a position
to actually change things here to
where we do live in a way in the future
that is sustainable, setting the exam-
ple starting right here.

Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, it con-
tains a list of literally hundreds of peo-
ple who have helped me get to where I
am today in this Chamber. A few of
them are in this Chamber with me
right now and a lot of them were here
Tuesday of last week when the Senate
was very kind to give me a sendoff. In
fact, I thought they were so happy I
was leaving, I had done something real-
ly wrong, and I was saving them some
trouble, but they were really happy be-
cause we were being happy together
about the years we have had together.
I have had 15 years together with
Members of the U.S. Senate, and it has
been the greatest 15 years of my life. I
learned as much about myself as I
learned about anybody else, but I
learned even more about my country,
which I love so passionately.
I want to take a few minutes today
to talk about a few people I want to
thank for what they said about me,
what they have done for me, and how
they have helped me. I wish to also tell
the people who may be listening to this
show or watching C–SPAN today to un-
derstand there are a lot of people who
make us work. We do all the mistakes
by ourselves without any help, but the
good things we do take a lot of help.
They take a lot of strength and a lot of
time and a lot of commitment.
The 100 Members of this Senate sit-
ting here have literally hundreds of
people behind them who help them do
their job they otherwise couldn’t do. I
represent 10 million people; Senators
from California, almost 30 million peo-
ple; from New York, almost 15 million
people. All of the States have different
populations, but all of them have a lot
of people who need help.
That is what Members of the Senate
are there to do, along with the Mem-
bers of the House, and that is to give
them the help they need from the coun-
try they love and the country they
were born in or became a naturalized
citizen in.
I want to talk today more about the
hard work—the hard work of licking
stamps and envelopes when I first got

in politics. I don’t do that anymore. We
punch a computer key, and it says
‘‘reply all’’ or ‘‘distribute to all’’ or
‘‘send to all.’’ Technology allows us to
communicate at the drop of a hat.
The biggest challenge I have every
day communicating is because of what
is on television beginning at midnight.
President Trump usually makes a
tweet about 3 o’clock in the morning,
and the news starts. We get phone
calls, our staff gets phone calls, and for
the rest of the day we are responding
to what he said at 3 a.m., knowing the
next morning at 3 a.m. there will be a
new tweet. There will be a new issue,
and he will be setting the pace. During
the afternoon, when people respond to
it, their response to it will be setting
the pace. All of us are reacting in the
third person or for the third time. It is
a challenging job.
With communications like it is and
24/7 television like it is and the media
like they are, it is really a challenge.
The men and women who work for me
help me to make that communication.
I want to, first of all, start off by
thanking them.
The lady sitting to my left—on the
screen, I guess that would make it your
right—Miss Amanda Maddox. Amanda
came to work for me a number of years
ago when I stole her from one of the
House Members because I knew she was
the best person on the floor of the
House. She was not an easy steal be-
cause I knew she was a tough lady, but
I knew I needed a tough lady and some-
body who could help. She has been a
tremendous help for me through a lot
of difficulties we never expected, nei-
ther she nor I—health challenges that I
had, challenges I had in terms of my
staff, training for trips I took, going on
trips I took, dealing with the media
during things we took on that were
tough. Every day she did it with skill
and aplomb. Every day she did it right,
and every day she helped me look much
better than I deserved.
I look in the mirror so I know what
I start out with, but when I get up and
open my mouth, I can do even more
damage. Amanda keeps me from doing
that. She is a first-class lady.
Another lady who is not here today,
unfortunately, is Marie Gordon, who is
in Atlanta. Marie works under Aman-
da. She works for me in Atlanta, GA.
They are really my communication.
You heard of left brain-right brain.
This is my left brain. Marie is my right
brain. They make me work, and I know
how many times I owe to say thank
you to them, and it is more than I
could ever come to. They have been
wonderful to me, and I will miss them
a lot as I retire, but I know they will
be here to help somebody else along the
same way who will take my place and
do just as good a job or better.
I want to, personally, publicly, thank
Amanda and Marie for what they have
done and how they made me look good.
A harder job is getting me around
with my current difficulties I am hav-
ing in terms of movement.
Where is Logan?
Logan is on the floor somewhere. He
is my pusher. He is not the kind of
pusher you are thinking about. He is
my wheelchair pusher. He doesn’t sell
anything else but wheelchairs, but he
does a great job with it and gets me in
a lot of bad places I am not supposed to
be able to get into, but he does it safe-
ly. We haven’t had any accidents, and
he makes me look good. I could not do
without Logan and his talent and his
willingness to get up early hours to get
me in a truck or get me in an airplane
or get me in my own car and get me to
the places I need to go safely and on
time and get me back home to see my
wife if we are in Atlanta or back here
to see my many supporters in the office
when they need me.
He is my instant communication
man. That means he is also my right
brain. He is in there thinking ahead to
make sure we have enough time to get
where we need to go and have enough
places to stop for the restroom, which
when you are in a wheelchair, that is
something you have to think about
from time to time and all the other lit-
tle parts of life you take for granted
until you can’t do them anymore.
When somebody helps you do them,
they are a lifetime friend, and Logan
Purvis is a lifetime friend for me in
what he does.
There is a real tall guy somewhere in
the room who is good golfer. His name
is Trey Kilpatrick. Trey has been with
me for 10 years. He started with me in
my third reelection or second reelec-
tion—one of my reelections—in the
first half of this century. Sometimes
elections seem like a century, not a
day or not an hour but a century.
Trey has done everything. He has
made appointments; he has substituted
for me; and he does an excellent job of
that. He has given me advice on what
not to say. When he does this, I know
what it means. I know what it means
from my wife, too, but when Trey does
it, it means to shut up, you dummy. He
gets me to shut up in time and not say
a bad thing. That is a valuable person.
He is also valuable because I can’t
play golf anymore, but I let him play
in my stead, and he is a scratch golfer.
For those of you who are listening or
watching this, that means he will beat
anybody who tries to beat him, and I
hope to get half the money. If I don’t
get half the money, I just enjoy seeing
him and his great talent.
He has his third child coming pretty
soon, so he is producing some good vot-
ers for us in about 15 or 20 years from
now. I appreciate that as well. I appre-
ciate Sally, his wife, and the sacrifice
she has made to let him take as much
time out of his life and her life as I
have taken out of their lives.
I appreciate those who have made me
look good. They made me look good all
the time, and I appreciate what they
have done to help me along the way
with my service in the U.S. Senate.
There is another person I want to
talk about for 1 minute. I will do it
some more tomorrow. I will break it
up, so I am not taking up all of the
time of the Chair, but I want to take as
much as I can right now to talk about
Joan Kirchner Carr. I have a unique
situation with the chief of staff. Joan
Kirchner is my chief of staff. Her name
is now Joan Carr. She changed her
name because she married my previous
chief of staff. She came with me as a
deputy chief of staff and fell in love
with my chief of staff, and they fell in
love with each other. He is now the at-
torney general of Georgia. She married
my chief of staff.
I actually have pretty good luck for
somebody who wants to get married. If
you come to my office, you will find a
husband or wife or something like that.
That is not a bad thing to happen in
Washington, DC.
Joan has been fantastic. She wrote
for AP. She covered me when I was al-
most a little guy. I first got elected in
1976, and she was working for AP at
that time in the Georgia Legislature
and wrote speeches about all the people
who were in the legislature, and I was
one of them. I was the minority leader.
I was the minority leader of a group of
19 Republicans who had 161 Democrats
opposing them. Custer had better odds
than we did. We didn’t have good odds
at all. She was a great writer, a great
reporter, and I fell in love with her—
not in the physical sense but in the
platonic sense—because I knew how
good she was at what she did.
Over the years, she impressed me so
much, I brought her along on whatever
campaign I had. I brought her along to
help me in the office I had. She ulti-
mately became my press secretary, my
deputy chief of staff, my chief of staff,
and my best friend. When you can
cover all those bases at one time, you
are doing pretty good, and Joan does
exactly that.
I am so grateful for all those who
have helped me along the way, all
those who gave a lot, all those who
gave a little but mostly those who gave
of themselves. Politicians are always
asking for money; they are always
talking about money; and they are al-
ways promising money. Money is fine,
but that doesn’t get you much of any-
thing—but relationships are impossible
to replace. You take a good relation-
ship with somebody who has worked
hard to help you get where you want to
go, there is nothing better or more val-
uable in life. No contribution of money
is worth anything more than just that
act of love or that act of kindness or
act of support that gets you where you
are going.
From this one guy who is leaving the
U.S. Senate under his own power, but
not as much as I used to have, I en-
joyed my 15 years more than you would
ever know, and I want to thank all
those people who helped me get here
and made it possible for me, particu-
larly those I pointed out now and will
point out later in my speeches this
week. May God bless them, may God
bless all of you, and may God bless the
United States of America.

S6978 December 11, 2019
I yield back.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). The Senator from West Virginia.
TRIBUTE TO JOHNNY ISAKSON
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I am
pleased to be on the floor with my col-
leagues to honor our friend and our col-
league, JOHNNY ISAKSON from Georgia.
I could almost tell you he is probably
hating this about now, but I want to
get my two cents in. I don’t need to
read off his impressive resume or thank
him for his service in the Georgia Na-
tional Guard, his successful real estate
business, his extensive public service,
and all that he has done and accom-
plished in Congress.
I want to talk about JOHNNY ISAKSON,
my friend. You hear everybody in this
body get up and we say: My colleague
and my friend. Sometimes I am not
sure we are really talking about
friends, but I want to tell you, JOHNNY,
I am not making this up. I am talking
about you as my friend. I am not just
being polite. You know me better than
that.
I will tell a little story, and he has
heard me tell it, but when I was first
elected to the House of Representatives
in the year 2000, I was walking down
the aisle, probably our first vote, had
no idea really what I was doing, didn’t
know anybody in the 435-Member body,
and I must have had it written all over
my face because I was wandering, and
this hand reaches out, and he says:
Why don’t you sit down here next to
me, and we can talk about what is
going on.
That was my introduction to JOHNNY
ISAKSON. We talked about what was
going on on the floor. We talked about
who his friends were. We talked about
the fact that my mother’s family was
from Perry, GA, and I had some Geor-
gia blood running through these veins.
JOHNNY, as we have heard, doesn’t
care if you have been here 20 years or
if you have been here 20 minutes, he
wants to be a friend. I heard him say
that the other day; that he has friends
and then he has future friends. I have
actually thought about that a lot over
the holiday weekend. He doesn’t care if
you are a Republican or Democrat,
from the North or the South—South
will probably help a little bit—East or
West, he has an innate ability to put
everybody at ease. He doesn’t count
anybody as an enemy. We have been to
the Prayer Breakfast. We have shared
our highs and lows together in our re-
spective lives. He never cares who gets
the credit. He just cares about getting
things done. I think you have seen that
through everybody’s wonderful tributes
to JOHNNY. He brings people together.
That is hard to do, but he leads by ex-
ample. He has been a great example to
me. You have been a great example to
me. My colleague from North Dakota,
Senator JOHN HOEVEN, has called you
‘‘Mr. Congeniality of the Senate.’’ I
can’t think of a better analogy. You
are Mr. Congeniality, but you are also
a very forceful, strong person with a
steel spine to know what is right and
what is wrong.
The Bible asks, ‘‘What does the Lord
require of you?’’ JOHNNY is living that
answer: to act justly, to love mercy,
and to walk humbly with God. We
could use a few more humble walkers
around here, I think. We could sure use
more JOHNNY ISAKSONs.
You will be there cheering us on, I
know, because your heart is with your
many friends who are here. I will miss
seeing you coming around the corner
because our offices are very close. I
will miss our car rides together and our
golf games together. I will miss that
extended hand in friendship, but I
know that you will still be extending it
from your home with your family and
your many, many friends.
I am really happy to be here. This is
happy for me because I think it is
happy for you. I think that as much as
you probably regret leaving and feel
there is more work to be done, you can
go in peace and love and know that you
have happy days ahead of you and a lot
of well-wishers on the way.
JOHNNY, thanks a lot. Thanks for ex-
tending that hand of friendship. It
meant so much to me then, as it does
today. Good luck and Godspeed.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire.
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I rise
today to join my colleagues, like the
Senator from West Virginia, and pay
tribute to our friend Senator JOHNNY
ISAKSON.
It has been an incredible privilege to
work with Senator ISAKSON. Senator
ISAKSON and I got to know each other
first through the bipartisan Senate
Prayer Breakfast and then serving to-
gether on the Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions and Finance Com-
mittees. I have always appreciated his
commitment to bipartisanship, prob-
lem-solving, and getting results for the
people in his home State of Georgia
and for people all across our country.
Because of that commitment, Senator
ISAKSON and I have worked together to
cosponsor a number of pieces of legisla-
tion, including efforts to improve care
for veterans and to make hearing aids
available over-the-counter. We also
partnered together to pass a resolution
designating March 25 ‘‘Cerebral Palsy
Awareness Day.’’
In addition to being kind, thoughtful,
and bipartisan, one thing stands out to
me about Senator ISAKSON the most:
his bravery in speaking out on issues
regarding human dignity. He dem-
onstrated that bravery early on in his
career as a State senator who spoke
out against a local anti-gay resolution.
At a time when standing up for the
rights of people of all sexual orienta-
tions wasn’t easy or convenient, he did.
That took real courage.
In addition, I am in awe of Senator
ISAKSON’s bravery in sharing publicly
his family’s experience losing his
grandson Charlie to an overdose. By
opening up and sharing this tragedy,
Senator ISAKSON helped reinforce that
this crisis affects families from all
walks of life. His public discussion has
and continues to make a real difference
as we work to break down the stigma
that comes with addiction. I know he
has continued working here in the Sen-
ate to prevent more families from ex-
periencing a loss like his own.
I am also grateful for Senator ISAK-
SON’s leadership on behalf of our coun-
try’s veterans. In June, Senator ISAK-
SON led a bipartisan Senate delegation
to Normandy to mark the 75th anniver-
sary of the D-Day landings. During
that visit, I saw firsthand JOHNNY’s in-
credible kindness and commitment to
our country’s veterans. I also saw how
quickly he dismissed compliments and
thanks directed his way to ensure that
others got credit for their part in his
success. I know that carries over to his
tireless efforts and hard work on behalf
of veterans as chairman of the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee.
Above all, I appreciate Senator ISAK-
SON’s friendship. He has represented
the people of Georgia in the Senate
with dignity, determination, and grit,
as well as a really good sense of humor.
He has made a real difference.
As Senator ISAKSON confronts a
health challenge of his own right now,
I am confident that he will face it with
the bravery, humility, and humor he
has exemplified throughout his life and
here in the Senate.
Senator ISAKSON, we will all miss you
terribly, but we are looking forward to
traveling to Georgia to see you and to
continue the many conversations that
have made us all better people and bet-
ter Senators and makes this country a
better place.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama.
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, I know I
am not in the right order, but since we
have a gap here, I thought I would just
jump in.
I am honored to be here today for the
JOHNNY ISAKSON memorial tribute part
two. Being the lower person in the Sen-
ate on the totem pole here, I didn’t get
a chance to talk last week, but I did sit
through the Senators’ remarks, which I
found very compelling.
I have found JOHNNY ISAKSON to be
very compelling. You know, there are
times when you watch a movie or a TV
show, and there are these special mo-
ments when two people meet, and there
is one person who has that spark, who
has that magic, and when they touch,
when they embrace with a hug or a
shake of the hands, all of a sudden, the
other person realizes they are talking
to somebody very special. That is
JOHNNY ISAKSON. That moment is built
around JOHNNY ISAKSON.
From the first time I had the chance
to meet him on January 3, 2018, I knew
all of those things that are being said
about his bipartisanship, about his
friendliness, and about how he wants to
work with people and how he cares
about people were absolutely true. I
could tell by the first handshake and
the ‘‘Welcome to the Senate, DOUG.’’
I will say that I think meeting me
and having that spark was a real test

of Senator ISAKSON more than anybody
in this body because you have to under-
stand that when we first met, it was
about 5 days before his beloved Georgia
Bulldogs were going to face the Univer-
sity of Alabama in the national cham-
pionship game.
For those who don’t know this, I am
telling you, you can think of ‘‘par-
tisanship’’ and ‘‘tribalism’’ as political
terms here in Washington, DC, but if
you ain’t experienced football partisan-
ship and football tribalism as far as
SEC rivals, you ain’t experienced noth-
ing. So the fact that JOHNNY ISAKSON
embraced me, a Democrat from his
neighboring State of Alabama, was
very, very special and something I will
always cherish.
I truly mean that, JOHNNY. I have
watched you as a member of the HELP
Committee with me. I have watched
you in so many hearings and listened
to you and your wisdom. That wisdom
often came from personal experiences.
Whether it was business or education
or whether it was the tragedy with
your grandson, everything about what
you have done in the U.S. Senate has
been personal.
I think that is something we should
all strive to do. Everything we do in
this body needs to be personal because
for all of our constituents, it is per-
sonal to us. It is personal to our States
and personal to everyone, but we don’t
always seem to act that way. A lot of
times, we act in a way that it seems to
be more political than personal. I have
never seen that in Senator ISAKSON. I
have seen that time and again, where
everything he has spoken about—
whether or not I agreed with him was
not the issue. I could tell that what he
was speaking of was personal, that it
meant something to him, and that he
knew how it was going to affect those
in the State of Georgia and across the
United States.
I can remember last year when we
were moving toward trying to find a
way to help farmers in south Georgia
and south Alabama who had been so
devastated by Hurricane Michael. This
was crossing party lines. He and Sen-
ator PERDUE and I talked a lot about
how this was affecting people and peo-
ple’s lives and how frustrating it was
for all of us to see the politics kind of
take over for a period of—I don’t
know—4 or 5 months while these farm-
ers suffered. That is the JOHNNY ISAK-
SON who reaches across the aisle. That
is the JOHNNY ISAKSON who cares about
people. That is the JOHNNY ISAKSON
who goes to funerals and sits in the
back of the room and then works to
make sure he does the right thing for
all those who could be affected.
JOHNNY, I am going to miss you a lot.
I enjoy our talks about football. I
enjoy kidding you. I enjoy your ribbing
me. But more importantly, I just enjoy
the camaraderie. I enjoy the warmth,
the feeling that I belong here. I, a Dem-
ocrat from Alabama, belong in this
body—maybe not after 2020. I ain’t
going to push you that far, JOHNNY,
OK? I get that. But for me, there has
always been a sense that you belong in
this body and you have a voice, and it
is an important voice. We need more of
that.
We need to make sure everything
JOHNNY ISAKSON said is remembered in
this body. We are about to go through
some rough seas. The ship of state, as
I have said before, is about to chart
some rough seas. We need to remember
the words of Senator ISAKSON as he
leaves this body to make sure we con-
tinue to do the work.
I think what we have done these last
couple of weeks is reflective of the leg-
acy of JOHNNY ISAKSON. Whereas what
was going on in the House and what
was dominating in the media—we still
got an NDAA done, we still got the FU-
TURE Act done, and we are still, over
in the House, negotiating USMCA.
Things in this body can work if we
work together and we make sure that
whatever happens after the first of the
year does not interfere with our ability
to relate to each other and to our con-
stituents and for the people of Amer-
ica.
JOHNNY, I have been honored and
privileged to serve with you. It will al-
ways be one of the greatest honors in
my life to have been able to have
served in this body with you. I wish
you and your family nothing but the
best in the future. I hope that you will
continue to contact me during the
football games and throughout so that
we can commiserate the good, the bad,
and the ugly about Georgia and Ala-
bama football. I love you, and I appre-
ciate you. Thank God you have been
here.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado.
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I
agree with my colleague from Ala-
bama, Senator JONES. Senator JONES
and I haven’t been here as long as some
of our other colleagues have been, but
I think it is probably fair to say that
when Senator JONES and I have a col-
league who is departing or if the Pre-
siding Officer has a colleague who is
departing, there will be one day of fare-
well. Maybe there will be an hour’s
window in which we can come to the
floor to say thank you or there will be
a reception in the Mansfield Room. I
think it is fair to say, as has my col-
league Senator JONES, that I have been
in line for a long time to get to this
day to say thank you to JOHNNY ISAK-
SON.
These tributes started when Senator
ISAKSON first announced he would be
retiring from the Senate. It is very fit-
ting that they continue through this
day because of the work he has pursued
and because of his accomplishments
but also because of the humanity that
rests in his heart. All of us are better
off because of his work.
In my knowing him, I hope that a lit-
tle bit of JOHNNY ISAKSON rubs off on
all of us and that we can be here today,
knowing that we are a better institu-
tion, better leaders, and better public
servants because of his model.
Senator ISAKSON has done a lot of
things that have been discussed on the
Senate floor. I don’t know how much I
can add, but I am going to add a few
things to the kind words that have
been said. So many people have said
such great things.
The first time Senator ISAKSON and I
had an opportunity to really work to-
gether was on something that will ben-
efit generations of Coloradans. It was
the VA hospital in Colorado—some-
thing that may have shaved off some of
the patience Senator ISAKSON has,
which seems to be unending at times.
This one, though, I am sure, took a lit-
tle bit of a toll—the frustration with a
very crazy collapse of a VA facility
that had taken over a decade and—
gosh—hundreds of millions of dollars to
complete. It was a project that started
out in the nineties but that didn’t get
done until about a year ago or so. It
was a project that had started out at
$300 million but that had ended up
being over $2 billion.
Through it all, Senator ISAKSON was
mindful of a very simple purpose,
which was that this facility was to ben-
efit the veterans who had given so
much to this country. The first thing
Senator ISAKSON said to me was: Don’t
worry. We are going to get this done,
and we are going to make reforms so
that this never happens again.
Under Senator ISAKSON’s leadership,
we have seen changes at the VA, and
we have also seen changes about how
new facilities are going to be com-
pleted and built so that we can avoid
the kinds of mistakes that led to the
delays in Colorado.
Ultimately, Senator ISAKSON knew
that this would be the crown jewel in
the Rocky Mountain region for vet-
erans’ service and veterans’ care, and
that is exactly what it continues to be.
We have Senator ISAKSON to thank for
the completion of that and the time on
task it took to get the job done.
Senator ISAKSON held a field hearing
in Aurora, CO, with, I think at the
time, Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson
to find out what had happened, why the
delays occurred, and then to fix it and
to hold the people accountable who
were responsible for the delays. That is
the kind of leadership Senator ISAKSON
provided.
Throughout that process, I think I
threatened to rename the colonoscopy
unit after a couple of people, but for
Senator ISAKSON, we should name the
town after him for the work he did to
complete that facility.
I remember the first time I gave him
a little bit of a treat from Colorado in
order to thank him for his work. It was
a box of Enstrom Toffee from a family
company in western Colorado. It was a
pretty incredible treat. I gave it to him
and thought he had never had this be-
fore.
He looked at it, and he said: Oh,
Enstrom Toffee. I love this stuff. I used
to give this out to my clients when I
was in real estate.

S6980 December 11, 2019
So I couldn’t even surprise him with
what I thought was a very special Colo-
rado treat.
JOHNNY is the kind of person who has
the ability to cut through problems, to
cut through the smoke, to cut through
the haze and the fog of a challenge and
go right to the merits of it, to very
concisely riff on any issue at a mo-
ment’s notice, cut to the heart of a
problem, and provide a solution to that
problem and to that challenge.
As the old saying goes, you are
known by the company you keep. When
one looks around this Chamber, one
sees the people who came to pay their
thanks to Senator ISAKSON. It is pretty
good company. He has done such great
things for Georgia and for this country.
I can’t thank Senator ISAKSON enough
for his leadership, for helping us all out
in Colorado, and for making this coun-
try a better place.
Senator ISAKSON, thank you for all
that you have done.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire.
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I
come to the floor this afternoon to pay
tribute to our good friend Senator
JOHNNY ISAKSON of the great State of
Georgia. I say ‘‘ours’’ because I know
he is a friend to everyone in this Cham-
ber. It was a real blow to me and, I
know, to all of the Senators to hear
that Senator ISAKSON wouldn’t be seek-
ing another term and that he would be
leaving early.
Over the years, JOHNNY and I have
had a chance to partner on a number of
bipartisan initiatives. He has estab-
lished a reputation in this body as an
honorable and hard-working Senator
who cares deeply about his constitu-
ents. Beyond that, he is just a kind
person. As we think about the acco-
lades we could say about somebody,
somebody who is kind to everyone they
meet, that is about as nice a thing, I
think, as you can say.
What JOHNNY does has been dem-
onstrated time and again in Congress.
He develops trust and good working re-
lationships, and he gets things done.
As chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs
Committee and a veteran himself,
JOHNNY has taken on the difficult but
critical task of making reforms to the
VA to better deliver care to those who
have fought for our country. Having
been through some of those challenges
with veterans in New Hampshire and
seeing what they are facing with get-
ting the care they need, to be able to
go back to them and say that because
of the work of Senator ISAKSON and
Senator TESTER, we now have the MIS-
SION Act—which is bipartisan legisla-
tion to expand care and services to vet-
erans—has been very reassuring.
We also know that Senator ISAKSON
is a fierce advocate for local priorities
in his home State. I have a sister in
Georgia, in Atlanta, and when I ask her
about Senator ISAKSON, she speaks
very positively about what she has
seen that he does in Georgia.
Of course, many of us here have been
reminded time and again of the impor-
tance of the Port of Savannah and its
dredging needs. I can especially iden-
tify with those since we have small
ports—much smaller than Savan-
nah’s—in New Hampshire, but they
consistently have dredging needs, so I
know how important it is to have an
advocate who is there all the time,
making sure that the needs of those
ports are being seen to.
One of the many areas where Senator
ISAKSON and I have found common
ground is reforming our budget proc-
ess. I think it is not a secret to any-
body in this body that the Federal
budget process is broken. Since 2011, I
have worked with Senator ISAKSON,
who had been working on trying to get
a biennial budgeting process for the
Federal Government. That is some-
thing that I think makes sense. Nine-
teen States, including New Hampshire,
operate on a biennial budget. We be-
lieve that taxpayers would be better
served by a process whereby Congress
budgets for 2 years rather than 1 and is
able to use the second year for over-
sight.
As we know, it is not easy to change
things in Washington. I couldn’t have
asked for a better partner in this ef-
fort.
One of the things I have especially
appreciated about JOHNNY is that he
has very little time for partisan snip-
ing, which has too often characterized
much of what we do here.
One of the gestures that mattered to
me and that has stood out about what
his character is and how he has oper-
ated in the Senate has been the fact
that he came to New Hampshire to ad-
vocate for our biennial budgeting ef-
forts in 2013, a year when I was in cycle
for reelection. It didn’t matter to him.
What mattered was that we were work-
ing on this issue, and it was important
to the American people.
I had the opportunity to go the fol-
lowing year to Atlanta, and we did the
same presentation in Atlanta to again
show that we could work in a bipar-
tisan way to try and address what
wasn’t working in New Hampshire.
I have especially appreciated that he
has taken that approach on everything
we have worked on together.
I know Senator ISAKSON also cares
deeply about the institution of the
Senate. He served as chairman of the
Senate’s Ethics Committee, a com-
mittee I have also been a member of,
though not nearly as long as he has. I
have seen closeup how he has faithfully
and honorably conducted the commit-
tee’s business and, again, how partisan-
ship has not been any part of how he
has approached his duties on the Ethics
Committee. What has been important
has been preserving the integrity of the
Senate and the responsibility that each
of us has as a Senator.
There have been so many ways in
which JOHNNY ISAKSON has bridged the
partisan divide. One of those is through
food, and I think all of my colleagues
would agree with me that one of the
highlights of our year is when Senator
ISAKSON has his bipartisan barbecue
lunch, which features not just the
dishes his home State is known for but,
as he points out, the best barbecue in
America.
In New Hampshire, we don’t have a
lot of barbecue, so I don’t have much
basis on which to judge, but I certainly
would agree it is very good barbecue.
I think, as somebody who has served
in the Army, he understands that the
way to our hearts is through our stom-
achs, and we know if we keep our
troops eating well that they do better,
and I think the same is probably true
of Senators. If we can keep eating well
and collaborate when we are doing
that, it is great for our morale, and it
is a great way to help work better to-
gether.
In closing, I just want to say that
throughout his time in Congress, JOHN-
NY ISAKSON has been a statesman, and
he has been a gentleman of the highest
order. They say that we remember peo-
ple not by what they say as much as by
how we feel we are treated, and I know
it is fair to say, whether it is the per-
son operating the elevator, the person
who is serving us lunch, each of us as
Senators, or his constituents, JOHNNY
ISAKSON has made all of us feel very
important, and he recognizes the value
that each individual in the Senate con-
tributes to this body. For that, I am
very appreciative, and I will miss you,
Senator ISAKSON.
Thank you for everything you have
done for all of us.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi.
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, let me
join my dear friend and colleague from
New Hampshire in paying tribute to so
many things about JOHNNY ISAKSON.
I know we are supposed to abide by
the rules, address remarks to the
Chair, and not speak to each other, and
if I occasionally look over at the senior
Senator from Georgia and call him
JOHNNY, I will apologize in advance to
the Chair and to the keeper of the
rules.
I think one of the points that Sen-
ator SHAHEEN was making about the bi-
partisan barbecue lunch every year is
that we ought to do this more often.
We choose sides so many times, and for
those of us on this side of the aisle, it
is three times at lunch every week—
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
The senior Senator from New Hamp-
shire and I never have a chance to have
lunch together because we are there
with our leadership talking about what
our folks are going to do.
JOHNNY ISAKSON decided at least one
time a year, when he was in charge of
making that decision, that he would
invite Republicans and Democrats.
Sometimes we got pushback from the
leadership of both parties because they
didn’t have us captive that particular
hour, and some of us who tried it didn’t
do it year after year after year. JOHNNY
ISAKSON has done that and has been an
example of bipartisanship.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6981
December 11, 2019
I hope, JOHNNY, we are not making
you weary of speechmaking, but I did
want to make an extra point that per-
haps others haven’t made and give a
quotation that Senator JOHNNY ISAK-
SON has made about others that he
would never have made about himself
because he is too modest.
I first became aware of JOHNNY ISAK-
SON in 1990, and he and I had not met at
that point, but I was in Atlanta, GA,
for some party function. JOHNNY ISAK-
SON was a successful businessman and a
member of the Georgia senate. He was
the Republican nominee for Governor
that year, and it was pretty well
known that he was not going to win
that race. But he came before us and
gave a rip-roaring talk, very impres-
sive, and I said to myself: You know,
he may not win this year, but this
JOHNNY ISAKSON fellow has a future,
and he is going to go places.
It turned out that the impression I
had that day was correct. He would go
on to serve for some time in a bipar-
tisan way in Georgia, and then, when
the Speaker of the House of Represent-
atives resigned from office, JOHNNY
ISAKSON was there to win the special
election and became my colleague in
the House of Representatives.
During that time when we served in
the House together, we were on the
deputy whip team together. And, JOHN-
NY, it was usually you and I sitting
next to each other at each of those
weekly meetings of the whip team.
I began to realize on a personal, day-
to-day basis what an outstanding lead-
er he was, what an articulate leader he
was, how persuasive he was, and how
able he was to actually come up with
some accomplishments in the Congress.
Boy, it is hard to get a bill passed,
and JOHNNY ISAKSON has gotten bill
after bill after bill passed for our Na-
tion’s veterans, of which I am proud to
be one—a list as long as my arms. I am
proud to be a veteran. I am proud to be
the father of an Air Force major and
the son of an Army-Air Force veteran
from World War II. We all appreciate in
our family, down through the genera-
tions, the efforts that JOHNNY has
made.
He has been so effective because he
understands people, because he under-
stands the business about building con-
sensus and using strong relationships
and treating each and every one of us
on both sides of this center aisle with
dignity and respect—the kind of re-
spect that we would hope to be treated
with always.
Senator ISAKSON enjoys poetry, as do
I, and I have been known to quote a
line or two from a poem, but today I
want to quote from a poem entitled
‘‘Sermons We See’’ by Edgar Guest.
The reason I want to do this is that
from time to time, when we have hon-
ored people JOHNNY ISAKSON admired,
he would cite this poem or a verse or
two from it as a way of honoring and
pointing out the virtues of the person
being honored. He would never be so
bold as to quote the poem about him-
self.
I submit today for the RECORD the
entire poem, and ask unanimous con-
sent that it be admitted.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
SERMONS WE SEE
(By Edgar Guest)
I’d rather see a sermon than hear one any
day;
I’d rather one should walk with me than
merely tell the way.
The eye’s a better pupil and more willing
than the ear,
Fine counsel is confusing, but example’s al-
ways clear;
And the best of all the preachers are the men
who live their creeds,
For to see good put in action is what every-
body needs.
I soon can learn to do it if you’ll let me see
it done;
I can watch your hands in action, but your
tongue too fast may run.
And the lecture you deliver may be very wise
and true,
But I’d rather get my lessons by observing
what you do;
For I might misunderstand you and the high
advise you give,
But there’s no misunderstanding how you
act and how you live.
When I see a deed of kindness, I am eager to
be kind.
When a weaker brother stumbles and a
strong man stays behind
Just to see if he can help him, then the wish
grows strong in me
To become as big and thoughtful as I know
that friend to be.
And all travelers can witness that the best of
guides today
Is not the one who tells them, but the one
who shows the way.
One good man teaches many, men believe
what they behold;
One deed of kindness noticed is worth forty
that are told.
Who stands with men of honor learns to hold
his honor dear,
For right living speaks a language which to
every one is clear.
Though an able speaker charms me with his
eloquence, I say,
I’d rather see a sermon than to hear one, any
day.
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I will
read the first two verses of ‘‘Sermons
We See’’ by Edgar Guest.
I’d rather see a sermon than hear one any
day;
I’d rather one should walk with me than
merely tell the way.
The eye’s a better pupil and more willing
than the ear.
Fine counsel is confusing, but example’s
always clear;
And the best of all the preachers are the
men who live their creeds,
For to see good put in action is what ev-
erybody needs.
I soon can learn to do it if you’ll let me see
it done;
I can watch your hands in action, but your
tongue too fast may run.
And the lecture you deliver may be very
wise and true,
But I’d rather get my lessons by observing
what you do;
For I might misunderstand you and the
high advise you give,
But there’s no misunderstanding how you
act and how you live.
Those are first two verses of ‘‘Ser-
mons We See.’’
I am so grateful for the sermons I
have been able to see as a Member of
the House of Representatives, as a fel-
low colleague of JOHNNY ISAKSON’s here
in the U.S. Senate.
He has demonstrated, in the way he
has acted, the way we should always
act. He has shown us how to be a gen-
tleman and how to be an accomplished
gentleman in the way he has lived and
the way he has worked across the aisle.
How he ends this chapter gives us an
opportunity to say thank you for the
way he has made the Nation better and
the way he has made life better for mil-
lions and millions of his fellow Ameri-
cans. Thank you, JOHNNY.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRAPO). The Senator from Oregon.
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, it is
now my pleasure to also say some
words of tribute to my colleague from
Georgia.
When I first came here and found out
about his real estate background and
his interest in homeownership, I felt it
was a powerful connection, in that
while I was never in the real estate
business, when I went back to Oregon
in 1991, I found a connection with Habi-
tat for Humanity and eventually be-
came their director, and it was all
about homeownership. So I spent a tre-
mendous amount of time working to
advance homeownership for families in
Oregon. Certainly, that is what the res-
idential rules say business is all about,
and he spent decades in that world be-
fore he came to Congress.
In fact, I also felt a connection be-
cause of his service in the House of
Representatives in Georgia. I only had
10 years in the Oregon House, and he
had far more than that in the Georgia
House of Representatives. I don’t know
if the Georgia House is like the Oregon
House, but the Oregon House was a
very functional place, where people
came to the floor and listened to each
other and shared ideas. They were only
allowed to speak for 5 minutes so ev-
erybody could hear each other. You
could borrow time from others, but if
you borrowed time, then, people start-
ed to say: The longer that you speak,
the less support you will have.
So it was great to have the entire
group present, talking to each other,
working, and talking on the floor.
That is how I envision the Georgia
House, as well, which I think is a tre-
mendous foundation for networking
ideas, working with others, realizing
that relationships make such a dif-
ference as we strive for policies we be-
lieve in. But the pathway involves rela-
tionships.
John F. Kennedy once said: ‘‘Let the
public service be a proud and lively ca-
reer.’’ When I think about my col-
league’s career spanning the Georgia
House and Georgia Senate and the U.S.
House and now the U.S. Senate, and all
that he has worked on, I think of it as
exactly that—a proud and lively career
not only that he can be proud of but
that all of us can be proud of, as evi-
denced by the many folks who have

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6982 December 11, 2019
come to the floor to say thank you for
your service.
There was one particular event that I
will never forget, and that is after the
passage of Dodd-Frank. I heard that a
problem had occurred related to the in-
terest on lawyer trust accounts, known
by the term IOLTA. This interest,
which was not allowed to accrue di-
rectly to the company of lawyers, was
dedicated by law to funding legal de-
fense funds for noncriminal assistance
to American citizens facing court pro-
ceedings so they could get a fair day in
court.
So I was trying to get unanimous
consent for us to fix this, and I needed
a partner on the Republican side of the
aisle. I was walking from one Senator
to another to another. I probably went
through about 15 Senators, and I would
say: Have you ever heard of IOLTA?
And, universally, the answer was no.
I would explain what it was and say
why it might make a difference, and
each time I spoke they would say: Well,
it is probably not something near the
top of my list to spend time on.
Then, I asked Senator ISAKSON: Have
you ever heard of IOLTA?
He said: Of course, I have.
I explained to him exactly what it
was and why it mattered, and I said:
Would you be a partner and try to fix
this so that the funds will go to the
public legal defense fund? And he said
yes.
We had to persuade, collectively, a
number of folks who had holds on the
amendment, which we did. We finally
had one Senator who was still putting
a hold on it, and we met with him—I
don’t know if my colleague from Geor-
gia will remember this, but we met
with him—and explained our case.
He said that, well, he would think
about it, and we decided to inform him
that we were going to ask for a unani-
mous consent motion on the floor at a
certain time on a certain day, and that
he was welcome to come back and ob-
ject if he wanted. He did come back,
and he met with us at that moment
and withdrew his objection, and we
passed that fix.
Now, interest rates have not been as
high. So the amount of funds that went
into the fund were not equivalent to
what they were in a previous era, but it
is an example of bipartisan work. It is
not blue or red work. It is work to help
make something go a little better for
people in the United States of America.
So to my colleague from Georgia,
thank you for doing many things to
make life better for the citizens of the
United States of America, working
with that goal in mind, not partisan-
ship.
Bless you and your family. Thank
you for your service.
I yield the floor.

ator from Georgia.
Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I sug-
gest the absence of a quorum.

unanimous consent that the order for

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
NOMINATION OF LAWRENCE VANDYKE
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I oppose
the nomination of Lawrence VanDyke
to fill a Nevada seat on the Ninth Cir-
cuit. When my Republican colleagues
decided to abandon blue slips for cir-
cuit court seats, many on our side
warned that we would start to see
nominees with little connection to the
States in which they were nominated
to sit. Those warnings are coming true.
We saw it earlier this year, when the
Senate approved the nomination of
Daniel Bress to fill a California seat on
the Ninth Circuit, even though he had
barely lived or practiced in California
as an adult.
Now, we are seeing it again with Mr.
VanDyke, whose ties to Nevada are
minimal. He did not grow up in Nevada
or attend any schools there. He did not
move to Nevada until 2015, after he had
lost a race for the State supreme court
of Montana. He did not become an ac-
tive member of the Nevada Bar until
October 2017. He does not have family
ties to Nevada. He does not currently
live in Nevada. Since he moved to Vir-
ginia 8 months ago, he has not been to
Nevada even once. Mr. VanDyke’s only
real tie to Nevada is that he was given
a job there for a few years as solicitor
general, apparently as a landing spot
after he lost his race in Montana.
There are many longtime members of
the Nevada legal community who are
well qualified to serve as a Federal cir-
cuit court judge. But none of them will
get the chance to fill this seat. Instead,
Senate Republicans are going to rub-
ber-stamp someone with minimal Ne-
vada ties for this Nevada judgeship.
How would my colleagues like it if that
happened to their States? Mr. VanDyke
also has a deeply troubling record.
When he was Montana’s solicitor gen-
eral, we saw from his emails that he al-
lowed political considerations to guide
litigation decisions. For example, in a
2013 email, he urged that Montana join
an amicus brief supporting the NRA in
a cert petition involving a challenge to
a gun law on the books. VanDyke
wrote, ‘‘I’m not sure I agree with the
strategy of bringing this case to
SCOTUS, but I think we want to be on
the record as on the side of gun rights
and the NRA.’’
I am troubled that, for his judicial
election campaign, he filled out an
NRA endorsement questionnaire in
which he said he agreed that ‘‘gun con-
trol laws are misdirected.’’ He also has
a lengthy history of criticizing and un-
dermining LGBTQ rights. This includes
his 2004 column where he wrote that
there is, ‘‘ample reason for concern
that same-sex marriage will hurt fami-
lies, and consequently children and so-
ciety.’’
Mr. VanDyke is the ninth Trump ju-
dicial nominee who has been rated
‘‘Not Qualified’’ by the ABA, out of
over 260 Trump nominees the ABA has
reviewed. The ABA conducts a peer re-
view process. In VanDyke’s case, the
ABA interviewed 60 attorneys and
judges who knew him and his work.
Mr. VanDyke’s peers said that Mr.
VanDyke ‘‘is arrogant, lazy, an ideo-
logue, and lacking in knowledge of the
day-to-day practice including proce-
dural rules,’’ ‘‘does not always have a
commitment to being candid and
truthful,’’ and ‘‘in some oral argu-
ments, he missed issues fundamental to
the analysis of the case.’’ These were
scathing comments from dozens of
judges and lawyers who know Mr. Van-
Dyke and his work well.
In short, it is no surprise that both of
Nevada’s Senators oppose this nomina-
tion. I agree with them. I will oppose
the VanDyke nomination, and I urge
my colleagues to do the same.
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I
rise today in strong opposition to the
nomination of Lawrence VanDyke to a
Nevada seat on the Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals.
I ask unanimous consent to have
printed in the RECORD a number of let-
ters and other documents relevant to
Mr. VanDyke’s nomination following
my remarks.
Mr. VanDyke’s temperament and in-
tegrity have been called into question
by his colleagues and the American Bar
Association, which rated him ‘‘Not
Qualified’’ for the Federal bench. Mr.
VanDyke’s record, including his oppo-
sition to rights of LGBT individuals
and commonsense gun control, is far
outside the mainstream.
First, I want to discuss concerns
raised by Mr. VanDyke’s colleagues re-
garding his temperament, competence,
and work ethic. The American Bar As-
sociation interviewed 60 of Mr.
VanDyke’s colleagues, including 43
lawyers, 16 judges, and one other indi-
vidual who have worked with Mr. Van-
Dyke in the four States where he has
worked and who are ‘‘in a position to
assess his professional qualifications.’’
In its letter to the committee, the
ABA reported that Mr. VanDyke’s col-
leagues described him as ‘‘arrogant,
lazy, an ideologue, and lacking in
knowledge of the day-to-day practice
including procedural rules’’ and stated
that he ‘‘has an ’entitlement’ tempera-
ment, does not have an open mind, and
does not always have a commitment to
being candid and truthful.’’
As Montana’s solicitor general, Mr.
VanDyke’s coworkers raised similar
concerns. They noted that he ‘‘avoids
work’’ and that he ‘‘does not have the
skills to perform, nor desire to learn
how to perform, the work of a lawyer.’’
These concerns were echoed by six re-
tired justices of the Montana Supreme
Court who wrote that Mr. VanDyke
‘‘has neither the qualifications nor the
temperament to serve as a federal
court of appeals judge.’’ Based in part
on these assessments, the ABA deemed
Mr. VanDyke ‘‘Not Qualified’’ to be a
Federal district court judge. The ABA

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6983
December 11, 2019
has rated 97 percent of President
Trump’s judicial nominees since 1989.
It has a process and standards. It has
rated 97 percent of President Trump’s
judicial nominees ‘‘Qualified’’ or ‘‘Well
Qualified.’’ Mr. VanDyke, then, is a
clear exception.
Mr. VanDyke’s record on LGBT
rights is also deeply troubling.
In a 2004 op-ed, he wrote that there is
‘‘ample reason for concern that same-
sex marriage will hurt families, and
consequentially children and society.’’
Lambda Legal rightly characterized
this claim as a ‘‘stigmatizing and
disproven myth.’’ During his hearing,
and in written questions, Mr. VanDyke
was given many opportunities to dis-
avow this statement, which is not sup-
ported by the research. He declined to
do so.
I asked Mr. VanDyke whether the
Supreme Court’s decision legalizing
same-sex marriage in Obergefell v.
Hodges has harmed families and chil-
dren, and I presented him with re-
search showing that the children of gay
and lesbian parents do as well as chil-
dren raised in opposite-sex households.
Still, Mr. VanDyke refused to disavow
his anti-LGBT statements.
In its letter to the committee, the
ABA reported that some interviewees
were unconvinced that Mr. VanDyke
would be fair to members of the LGBT
community. The ABA further noted
that Mr. VanDyke ‘‘would not say af-
firmatively that he would be fair to
any litigant before him, notably mem-
bers of the LGBT community.’’ I am
concerned based on Mr. VanDyke’s
record and the ABA’s assessment that
LGBT litigants cannot expect to be
treated fairly in his courtroom.
Finally, I would like to highlight Mr.
VanDyke’s long history of advocating
against commonsense gun control.
As Nevada solicitor general, he un-
dermined implementation of a 2016 bal-
lot initiative, passed by Nevada voter
that would have closed a loophole by
expanding background checks for pri-
vate gun sales. As Montana solicitor
general, he called assault weapons bans
‘‘ineffective’’ and questioned the Fed-
eral Government’s authority to regu-
late guns in any capacity.
While running for a seat on the Mon-
tana Supreme Court in 2014, he filled
out an NRA Questionnaire that high-
lights how far outside the mainstream
his views on gun control are.
On this questionnaire, Mr. VanDyke
indicated that he believes all gun con-
trol laws are ‘‘misdirected.’’ He op-
posed banning the possession, pur-
chase, or sale of any firearm. He also
opposed assault weapons bans and re-
quiring background checks for guns
sold at gun shows.
Mr. VanDyke even appeared to pledge
loyalty to the NRA itself. He wrote on
the questionnaire that he had stopped
being a member of the organization be-
cause he ‘‘didn’t want to risk recusal if
a lawsuit came before [him] where the
NRA was involved.’’ Mr. VanDyke will-
ingly offered these views when he was
seeking judicial office, and so I asked
him to answer the same questions from
the NRA’s questionnaire as part of this
nomination process. He declined to do
so.
It is distressing that a nominee
would offer his views on gun control to
the NRA, but not to a Member of the
U.S. Senate who must vote on his life-
time appointment to the Federal
bench.
It is no wonder that gun safety
groups, including the Giffords Law
Center and the Coalition to Stop Gun
Violence, fear that Mr. VanDyke has
demonstrated a ‘‘clear lack of impar-
tiality’’ and is ‘‘incapable of serving as
an impartial justice.’’
The Nevada Senators strongly oppose
Mr. VanDyke, in part because he lacks
ties to the State. Their opposition is
justified. It is hard to believe that this
nominee, whose views are so far out-
side the mainstream and who is un-
qualified for the position, is the best
the Nevada legal community has to
offer.
Federal appeals court judges must be
knowledgeable, and litigants must
have confidence that these judges will
treat them fairly and honestly. Unfor-
tunately, Mr. VanDyke does not meet
these basic standards. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in opposing his nom-
ination.

defense. Congress’ subsequent study of the
ban, as well as state and local law enforce-
ment agency reports, showed that contrary
to the ban’s supporters’ claims, the guns and
magazines had never been used in more than
about 1%-2% of violent crime. Since the ban
expired in 2004, the numbers of these fire-
arms and magazines owned have risen to all-
time highs and violent crime has fallen to a
42-year low. Would you support state legisla-
tion restricting the possession, ownership,
purchase, sale, and/or transfer of semi-auto-
matic firearms and/or limits on the capacity
of magazines designed for self-defense?
* Semi-automatic firearms have been com-
monly used for hunting, target shooting, and
self-defense since their introduction in the
late 1800s. All semi-automatics fire only one
shot when the trigger is pulled. They are not
fully-automatic machine guns, which have
been strictly regulated under federal law
since 1934.
a. lll Yes, I would support such legisla-
tion for semi-automatic firearms only.
b. lll Yes, I would support such legisla-
tion for magazines only.
c. lll Yes, I would support such legisla-
tion for semi-automatic firearms and maga-
zines.
d. X No, I would oppose such legislation.
7. Federal law requires federally-licensed
firearms dealers to keep records of the make,
model, caliber, and serial number of all fire-
arms sold. Would you support state legisla-
tion requiring all firearm owners to register
all their firearm(s) for entry into a central-
ized state file or database?
a. ll Yes, for all firearms.
b. ll Yes, for all handguns.
c. ll Yes, for some firearms. Please speci-
fy which firearms:

d. X No, I oppose state registration of fire-
arms.
8. Would you support the state licensing*
of law-abiding citizens who own, possess and
use firearms?
*Licensing, as used here, refers to state
legislation requiring firearm owners to ob-
tain a license from a government official or
agency to own and possess a firearm. As a
rule, firearm owner licensing laws generally
require fingerprinting, photographing, and/or
a background investigation of the applicant.
Note: this is different from acquiring a ‘‘per-
mit to carry’’ a concealed weapon from the
state.
a. ll Yes, for owners of all firearms.
b. ll Yes, for owners of all handguns.
c. ll Yes, for owners of some firearms.
Please specify which firearms:
d. X No, I oppose state registration of fire-
arm owners.
9. Federal law requires all federally-li-
censed firearms dealers to conduct a crimi-
nal records check prior to the sale of any
firearm, whether the sale occurs at their re-
tail store or at a gun show. Access to the
FBI-run telephone-based ‘‘instant check’’
system is limited to licensed dealers only.
Under federal law, individuals who only oc-
casionally sell firearms from their personal
collections are not ‘‘engaged in the business’’
of selling firearms, and are therefore (1) not
required to be licensed; (2) not required to
conduct records checks prior to transferring
firearms; and (3) not permitted to access the
records check system used by licensed deal-
ers. Although less than 1% of guns used in
crimes are purchased at gun shows (Depart-
ment of Justice, Bureau of Statistics), gun
control advocates are trying to ban firearms
sales at gun shows by occasional sellers and
private collectors, or require that any trans-
actions involving their legal property be
conducted through a licensed dealer. Would
you support legislation restricting firearms
sales by occasional sellers and private collec-
tors at gun shows?
a.ll Yes, I would support such legisla-
tion. Please explain:
b. X No, I would oppose such legislation.
10. In the United States, the number of pri-
vately owned guns has risen by more than 10
million annually to an all-time high. Mean-
while, according to the National Center for
Health Statistics, firearm accident deaths
have decreased by 90 percent over the last
century. This trend is due in part to an in-
creasing use of NRA firearm safety training
programs by tens of thousands of RA Cer-
tified Instructors, schools, civic groups and
law enforcement agencies. Nevertheless, sev-
eral states have recently considered legisla-
tion that would mandate the placement of
locking devices on firearms kept in the
home. These devices greatly restrict access
to firearms for self-defense purposes and po-
tentially increase the risk of accidental dis-
charge of a firearm. Would you support legis-
lation that would mandate the use of locking
devices or other locking procedures for fire-
arms stored in the home?
a. llYes, I would support such legisla-
tion. Please explain:
b. X No, I would oppose such legislation.
11. Recently, some employers have ex-
tended their ‘‘gun-free’’ workplace rules to
employees’ locked private vehicles in park-
ing lots. Such policies effectively disarm
law-abiding citizens, including concealed
weapon license holders, from the time they
leave their house in the morning to their re-
turn home in the evening. Would you support
‘‘Employee Protection’’ legislation that
would allow law abiding citizens to keep law-
fully transported firearms locked in their
personal vehicles while parked on publicly
accessible, privately owned parking lots (see
2013 Montana House Bill 571)?
a. llYes, I would sponsor/cosponsor this
legislation.
b. X Yes, I would support this legislation.
c. ll No, I would oppose this legislation.
Please explain:
12. Current Montana law (MCA § 45–8–328)
lists certain ‘‘prohibited places,’’ including
banks, government office buildings and es-
tablishments where alcoholic beverages are
served, where concealed weapon permit hold-
ers (and law enforcement officers) may not
carry a concealed firearm. This puts law-
abiding citizens at a disadvantage because,
although they could carry ‘‘openly’’ in these
locations, criminals will obviously ignore
the law and carry concealed. Would you sup-
port legislation to repeal the restrictions on
where law-abiding citizens may carry a con-
cealed weapon (see 2013 Montana House Bill
358)?
a. X Yes, I would sponsor/cosponsor this
legislation.
b. X Yes, I would support this legislation.
c. ll No, I would oppose this legislation.
Please explain:
13. Current Montana law allows law-abid-
ing citizens to carry a concealed weapon for
defense of themselves and others, free from
government interference, anywhere outside
the official boundaries of any city or town.
In order to cross into a city or town and still
be in compliance with Montana law, how-
ever, a law-abiding citizen must have a valid
concealed weapon permit. Would you support
state legislation to remove the requirement
that law-abiding citizens obtain govern-
mental permission in order to provide a
means of self-protection when they cross
into the boundaries of cities and towns in
Montana (see 2013 Montana House Bill 304)?
a. X Yes, I would sponsor/cosponsor this
legislation.
b. X Yes, I would support this legislation.
c. ll No, I would oppose this legislation.
Please explain:
14. Under the National Firearms Act
(NFA), an individual wanting to acquire an
NFA-regulated item, such as a firearm sound
suppressor or fully automatic firearm, must
submit the proper paperwork and finger-
prints to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms and Explosives (BATFE), pay a $200
tax and have a chief local law enforcement
officer (CLEO) sign-off on the proper forms.
Some CLEOs simply refuse to sign such
forms, even for otherwise qualified appli-
cants, because they oppose civilian posses-
sion of these items, are fearful of liability or
the perceptions of anti-gun constituents, or
for other subjective reasons. Legally owned
NFA items are very rarely used in crime,
with the total number of cases documented
numbering in the single digits. This legisla-
tion would also include an immunity provi-
sion for CLEOs. Would you support state leg-
islation that would make this process more
objective by requiring CLEOs to sign such
forms if the applicant is not otherwise pro-
hibited from obtaining an NFA item?
a. X Yes, I would sponsor/cosponsor this
legislation.
b. X Yes, I would support this legislation.
c. ll No, I would oppose this legislation.
Please explain:
15. Many public colleges and universities
allow visitors with concealed handgun per-
mits to carry concealed firearms on their
campuses, yet nearly all state-funded higher
learning institutions ban faculty, staff and
students from carrying concealed handguns
on campus—even if they have permits to
carry concealed firearms. The NRA believes
a person with a permit to carry a concealed
firearm should be able to carry that firearm
concealed anywhere he or she has a legal
right to be, except in certain ‘‘sterile’’ high-
security locations. Assuming each classifica-
tion of individuals listed below possessed a
concealed handgun permit recognized by the
state, who do you believe should legally be
allowed to carry a concealed handgun on
state college and university campuses?
a. X All law-abiding persons, including
visitors, faculty, staff and students.
b. ll Visitors, faculty, staff and some stu-
dents. Please explain:
c. ll Faculty, staff and students.
d. ll Visitors, faculty and staff.
e. ll Faculty and staff.
f. ll Each college or university should de-
termine the policy for its campus.
g. ll No one should be allowed to carry a
concealed handgun on state college and uni-
versity campuses.
16. The residents of 39 states can legally
own firearm suppressors. Contrary to Holly-
wood portrayals, suppressors are virtually
never used in crime or poaching and criminal
misuse carries severe penalties. Suppressors
can improve shooting accuracy, protect
against hearing loss, reduce noise complaints
from the public and make shooting and hunt-
ing more enjoyable. The current prohibition
on hunting suppressor use, in effect, requires
firearms to be as loud as they can possibly
be, contrary to the manner in which vir-
tually all other noise-emitting objects are
treated. Suppressors are strictly regulated
under federal law. Individual purchasers
must pay a $200 federal tax; submit to an ex-
tensive background check that includes fin-
gerprints and photographs; and obtain the
approval of the chief law enforcement officer
in their jurisdiction. Would you support leg-
islation that allows the use of suppressors
while hunting and allow law-abiding Mon-
tana sportsmen the freedom to protect
against hearing loss, improve accuracy and
reduce noise complaints?
a. X Yes, I would sponsor/cosponsor this
legislation.
b. X Yes, I would support this legislation.
c. ll No, I would oppose this legislation.
Please explain:
17. Many states provide civil liability pro-
tection to private property owners who allow
the public to hunt on their property. Shield-
ing property owners from frivolous lawsuits
eliminates a significant concern for property
owners and encourages them to open their
land to hunting. This enhances public hunt-
ing opportunities and assists the state in ef-
fectively managing its wildlife populations.
Would you support passing or strengthening
liability protections for private landowners
who allow hunting on their property?
a. X Yes, I would sponsor/cosponsor this
legislation.
b. X Yes, I would support this legislation.
c. ll No, I would oppose this legislation.
Please explain:
18. Youth/mentored hunting programs have
been implemented in 29 states to help pro-
mote our hunting heritage by removing bar-
riers to participation. This enormous case
study has proven safe beyond anyone’s ex-
pectations. Mentored hunting allows novice
hunters—young and old—to hunt prior to
completing hunter education requirements if
they hunt under the close supervision of a li-
censed, adult hunter who meets hunter edu-
cation requirements. This is the ‘‘try it be-
fore you buy it’’ concept. These programs
also dramatically reduce or eliminate min-
imum hunter ages. Would you support a
youth/mentored hunting law to help promote
Montana’s hunting heritage?
a. X Yes, I would sponsor/cosponsor a
youth/mentored hunting law.
b. X Yes, I would support implementing a
youth/mentored hunting law.
c. ll No, I oppose implementing a
mentored hunting law. Montanans will prove
to be the exception to the rule of extraor-
dinary safety established by the citizens of
the 29 states that have implemented this
program.

Candidate Signature: Lawrence VanDyke
Date: 9/18/14
AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION,
October 29, 2019.
Re Nomination of Lawrence J.C. VanDyke to
the United States Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit.
Hon. LINDSEY GRAHAM,
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
Hon. DIANNE FEINSTEIN,
Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN GRAHAM AND RANKING
MEMBER FEINSTEIN: The American Bar Asso-
ciation’s Standing Committee on the Federal
Judiciary has received a full report on Law-
rence J.C. VanDyke and a supplemental re-
view by a former chair of the Committee.
The Committee’s work is based solely on a
review of integrity, professional competence,
and judicial temperament. Based on these
criteria, a substantial majority of the Com-
mittee has determined that Mr. VanDyke is
‘‘Not Qualified,’’ and a minority determined
that he is ‘‘Qualified’’ to serve on the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-
cuit. The majority rating represents the
Standing Committee’s official rating. I write
to offer a brief explanation of this rating.
The evaluator’s Formal Report is based on
60 interviews with a representative cross sec-
tion of lawyers (43), judges (16), and one
other person who have worked with the
nominee in the four states where he has
worked and who are in a position to assess
his professional qualifications. They include
but are not limited to attorneys who worked
with him and who opposed him in cases and
judges before whom he has appeared at oral
argument. The evaluator obtained detailed
background materials such as more than 600
pages of publicly produced emails involving
and/or written by Mr. VanDyke, news reports
where Mr. VanDyke had been interviewed,
and articles and opinions written about him.
Mr. VanDyke is a highly educated lawyer
with nearly 14 years of experience in appel-
late law, including one year as a law clerk,
an associate in a law firm, and as a Solicitor
General for over five-plus years, first in Mon-
tana and then Nevada, two states in the
Ninth Circuit where he would serve if con-
firmed. The Committee was tasked with bal-
ancing Mr. VanDyke’s accomplishments with
strong evidence that supports a ‘‘Not Quali-
fied’’ rating.
Mr. VanDyke’s accomplishments are offset
by the assessments of interviewees that Mr.
VanDyke is arrogant, lazy, an ideologue, and
lacking in knowledge of the day-to-day prac-
tice including procedural rules. There was a
theme that the nominee lacks humility, has
an ‘‘entitlement’’ temperament, does not
have an open mind, and does not always have
a commitment to being candid and truthful.
Some interviewees raised concerns about
whether Mr. VanDyke would be fair to per-
sons who are gay, lesbian, or otherwise part
of the LGBTQ community. Mr. VanDyke
would not say affirmatively that he would be
fair to any litigant before him, notably
members of the LGBTQ community.
Even though Mr. VanDyke is clearly
smart, comments were made that in some
oral arguments he missed issues funda-
mental to the analysis of the case. There
were reports that his preparation and per-
formance were lacking in some cases in
which he did not have a particular personal
or political interest.
While the evaluator was careful in her
interview with Mr. VanDyke not to name
interviewees, the nature of the issues that
gave rise to some of the negative comments
had been publicly discussed and other ad-
verse comments could be raised without
identifying interviewees. The negative issues
discussed in this letter were thoroughly dis-
cussed with interviewees and vetted with the
nominee. Significantly, the interviewees’
views, negative or positive, appeared strong-
ly held on this nominee.
The Committee’s work is guided by the
Backgrounder which reflects that judgment
is a component of professional competence,
and that open-mindedness, courtesy, pa-
tience, freedom from bias, and commitment
to equal justice under law are components of
judicial temperament. Based on these prin-
ciples, a substantial majority of the Com-
mittee determined that the nominee is ‘‘Not
Qualified’’ to be a Ninth Circuit judge.
Very truly yours,
WILLIAM C. HUBBARD.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President,
yesterday, I went to the Senate floor to
ask unanimous consent on the DETER
Act, bipartisan legislation that I au-
thored alongside Senator RUBIO that is
languishing in the Senate legislative
graveyard.
The DETER Act is absolutely critical
to protect our democracy from foreign
interference. It serves a clear, simple,
and essential purpose. It says to Russia
and any other foreign power that, if
they interfere in our elections and un-
dermine the integrity of our democ-
racy, they will face severe con-
sequences in the form of tough sanc-
tions. Foreign interference in our elec-
tions remains as critical a threat as
ever. That is why, on November 5,
seven U.S. Federal agencies jointly
stated, ‘‘Russia, China, Iran, and other
foreign malicious actors all will seek
to interfere in the voting process or in-
fluence voter perceptions. Adversaries
may try to accomplish their goals
through a variety of means, including
social media campaigns, directing
disinformation operations, or con-
ducting disruptive or destructive
cyberattacks on state and local infra-
structure.’’
The Senate endorsed the inclusion of
this bill in this year’s National Defense
Authorization Act, unanimously pass-
ing a resolution in the fall instructing
NDAA conferees to include such a pro-
vision in the conference report. How-
ever, the Republican leadership has
stonewalled the inclusion of this bill in
the NDAA. Instead, we are voting this
week on two Ninth Circuit judicial
nominees of dubious qualifications, in-
cluding one who was rated ‘‘Unquali-
fied’’ by the American Bar Association,
ABA.
Circuit courts play an important role
in our country. Circuit court judges re-
view the decisions of district court
judges. Instead of nominating experi-
enced jurists, Republicans have chosen
to advance two nominees, Messrs.
Bumatay and VanDyke, neither of
whom have absolutely any experience
as judges, at the Sate or Federal level.
Mr. VanDyke was harshly described by
his peers and colleagues as someone
who is ‘‘arrogant and disrespectful to
others, both in and outside of this of-
fice. He avoids work. He does not have
the skills to perform, nor desire to
learn how to perform, the work of a
lawyer.’’ This harsh criticism of a judi-
cial nominee from their peers is ex-
tremely rare and factored in heavily
into the ABA’s ‘‘Unqualified’’ rating.
Instead of trying to confirm unquali-
fied radical ideologues to the bench,
Republicans should be working across
the aisle to pass bipartisan legislation
to secure our elections and address
other national priorities. Failing to do
so is a dereliction of our duty.

NOMINATION OF STEPHEN HAHN
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the
Food and Drug Administration plays
an important part in our families’ ev-
eryday lives. When people across the
country do anything from using a med-
ical device, to getting a prescription
filled, to sitting down together to eat,
they rely on the FDA to keep them
safe and healthy.
There is a lot at stake for our fami-
lies, and it is critical that we know the
FDA’s leadership will uphold its gold
standard of safety and effectiveness
and put people’s health and well-being
first. I am not convinced that is the
case under Hahn’s leadership.
I have reviewed his records and care-
fully considered his answers on key
issues. I want the Senate to know I was
particularly concerned by his evasive
response when it came to how to ad-
dress skyrocketing youth e-cigarette
use. Just a few months ago, the Trump
administration promised it would take
action and pull non-tobacco-flavored e-
cigarette products from the market
until after the FDA had reviewed them,
only to reverse its course.
We need a leader at the FDA who will
fight for our families and stand up to
this administration on this important
policy. When Members from both sides
of the aisle asked him about this, he
refused to commit to follow through on
the promising step President Trump
decided to abandon. So given his an-
swers—or lack thereof, really—on this
concerning issue, I am voting no on

Mr. ALEXANDER. We have a va-
cancy at the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration. So what if someone said:
Wouldn’t it be a good idea to go see if
we can recruit the chief medical officer
at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in
Houston, one of the most distinguished
institutions in the world, an organiza-
tion that is even larger than the FDA?
Wouldn’t it be a good idea to go get a
practicing oncologist? Wouldn’t it be a
good idea to get somebody who has
worked at the National Institutes of
Health and who has letters of rec-
ommendation from more than 80 orga-
nizations? Wouldn’t it be a good idea to
get someone who has been rec-
ommended and endorsed by the last
five FDA Commissioners, under Presi-
dents Trump, Obama, and Bush?
Well, we have such a person. That
person came out of our committee 18 to
5—Dr. Stephen Hahn, the Chief Medical
Officer of the MD Anderson Cancer
Center. We should be grateful he is
willing to take this job at this period
of time.
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, Mr. President.

NOMINATION OF AURELIA SKIPWITH
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I take
no joy today in rising to urge my col-
leagues to join me in voting no on the
cloture of the nomination of Aurelia
Skipwith to serve as Director of the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
To my disappointment and dismay,
Ms. Skipwith has not provided infor-
mation pertaining to her activities at
the Interior Department that was re-
quested by Senate Democrats during
her nomination process. Despite my re-
peated requests for this information
since August—requests made twice in
writing and twice in person during her
nomination process—Ms. Skipwith has
refused to produce information that is
routinely provided by other nominees.
She even suggested—get this—that I
file a Freedom of Information Act re-
quest for the basic information I seek.
I worry, once confirmed, Ms.
Skipwith’s forthrightness will only
worsen, which will severely impair our
ability to conduct meaningful over-
sight over the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service.
Ms. Skipwith’s lack of candor has
elevated questions that already existed
about her qualifications, her commit-
ment to environmental conservation,
and whether she can ethically lead the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. I be-
lieve it is irresponsible to confirm a
nominee given these serious out-
standing issues. I urge my colleagues
to join me in voting no on cloture.
I thank the Presiding Officer.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming.
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, the
Senate is considering the nomination
of Aurelia Skipwith to be Director of
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
The agency needs Senate-confirmed
leadership in place, and Ms. Skipwith
is well qualified to serve as the Direc-
tor. She has a degree in biology from
Howard University, a degree in molec-
ular genetics from Purdue University,
and a law degree from the University of
Kentucky. For almost 3 years, Ms.
Skipwith has served as the Department
of the Interior’s Deputy Assistant Sec-
retary for Fish, Wildlife and Parks.
At her nomination hearing, Ms.
Skipwith was introduced by Demo-
cratic Congressman WILLIAM LACY
CLAY, of Missouri. He said Ms.
Skipwith was ‘‘one of the most tal-
ented, hardest working and driven per-
sons that I have ever known.’’
I encourage every Senator to support
her nomination.
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO JOHNNY ISAKSON
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise
today with my colleagues to honor my
friend, the senior Senator from Geor-
gia. At the end of this year, Senator
ISAKSON will retire after 20 years of
service to the people of Georgia in
Washington.
After protecting our Nation in the
Georgia Air National Guard, grad-
uating from the University of Georgia,
and serving as a representative in his
State legislature, the door opened for a
son from Atlanta to run for Congress.
Georgia saw in him then what we see in
him now: a principled leader, a skillful
communicator, and a man worth trust-
ing. It is no surprise that the people of
Georgia have renewed their trust in
him time and time again. And I know
I speak for my colleagues when I say
that we are grateful they did.
After six years representing Geor-
gia’s Sixth Congressional District, the
Senate gained a true statesman when
he entered in 2005. When I was pre-
paring for these remarks, I came across
one of his Senate reelection speeches. I
thought it was particularly revealing
to his character and how he carries
himself in the Senate. He told the
crowd that was cheering him on:
I promise you I am ready . . . I am ready
to tackle whatever problem life brings to us
as Americans.
With my feet rooted in conservative prin-
ciples, my belief in God the Father Al-
mighty, and my belief in the people of Geor-
gia.
Mr. President, that is who Senator
ISAKSON is.
No matter the obstacles that came
his way, he has always been a steady
hand—strengthened by his enduring
faith and deep respect for his constitu-
ents. One of those mountains to climb
was working on behalf of our veterans
to improve conditions at the VA and
end the backlog that was building for
years. Under his leadership on the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee, I was proud
to work with him to pass the CHIP-In
for Vets Act into law in 2016. The bill
allows local communities to take the
lead on new projects by permitting the
VA to accept private contributions to
ensure VA projects are finished both on
time and on budget. His support of this
bill meant that Nebraskans have the
opportunity to save millions of dollars
when constructing the new Omaha VA
Ambulatory Clinic. A GAO report indi-
cates that our new facility is now $34
million under budget and 41⁄2 months
ahead of schedule. I know generations
of Nebraskans will be grateful for his
help in getting this bill across the fin-
ish line.
On a more personal note, one of my
fondest memories of JOHNNY was our
trip to Normandy, France, this year to
commemorate the 75th anniversary of
D-Day. As a veteran himself, everyone
in this body understood the abounding
respect and gratitude he carried for our
Nation’s servicemembers as he led the
delegation—the same respect and grati-
tude he shows to our veterans everyday
as he leads the Senate in providing re-
sources to meet our veterans’ needs.
Mr. President, I think if there is any
moment that foreshadowed JOHNNY’s
service to Georgia and our Nation, it
was his speech immediately after being
sworn in to the House of Representa-
tives. He turned to his new colleagues
and said, ‘‘I hope, in years to come, I’ll
be a respected friend, and one who
joined with you to make a difference in
the United States of America.’’ What a
respected friend he has become. What a
difference he has made. It has been a
honorable journey, and it ends with us
confirming that the legacy he has
worked hard to achieve from the very
beginning has now come true in the
end.
JOHNNY, you are a great leader, a
careful listener, and a gifted legislator.
It has been a privilege to work with
you and call you friend. You have
served the State of Georgia and our
country well. I wish you and Diane all
the best on this next chapter in your
lives. Godspeed.
f
TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT MAJOR
DEREK GONDEK
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, today I
rise to pay tribute to SGM Derek
Gondek for his exemplary dedication to
duty and service as an Army congres-
sional fellow and congressional budget
liaison for the Assistant Secretary of
the Army, Financial Management and
Comptroller. Sergeant Major Gondek is
retiring after 27 years of dedicated
service to his country and the U.S.
Army.
A native of Lewiston, ME, Sergeant
Major Gondek enlisted as an infantry
soldier in July 1992, attending infantry
one station unit training at Fort
Benning, GA.
Sergeant Major Gondek has served in
a broad range of assignments during
his Army career at all levels of com-
mand. Starting as a rifleman with the
509th Parachute Infantry Regiment at
Fort Polk, LA, Sergeant Major Gondek
led soldiers as a team leader, platoon
sergeant, first sergeant, and operations
sergeant major across the Army. His
highest level of leadership was as a bat-
talion command sergeant major of the
2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment,
25th Infantry Division at Schofield
Barracks, HI. He has also instructed at
the Army’s Jumpmaster School and
provided coaching to rotational units
at the Army’s Joint Multinational
Readiness Center in Hohenfels, Ger-
many. Sergeant Major Gondek has
served forward deployed to both Iraq
and Afghanistan.
In 2017, Sergeant Major Gondek
began his tenure with the U.S. Senate,
first as a Defense fellow and next in his
subsequent assignment as a congres-
sional budget liaison for the U.S.
Army. Sergeant Major Gondek worked
tirelessly with Members of Congress
and their staffs to accurately articu-
late the Army’s budget positions to the
Appropriations Committees. His profes-
sionalism, diligence, and commitment
to the mission are unmatched, and his
work both as a fellow and as a liaison
very effectively represented the U.S.
Army and the Department of Defense
to the U.S. Congress.
The foundation of Derek’s military
success is his family. He is a devoted
husband to his wife Maura and com-
mitted father to his daughters, Winnie,
Ellie, and Zoey. Maura, Winne, Ellie
and Zoey provide the foundation for
Derek’s service. Their attitude of serv-
ice, sacrifice, and care for others per-
meates every organization and activity
they participate in. The Gondek family
is truly an example of servant leader-
ship in the Army and the communities
they engage.
Throughout his career, Sergeant
Major Gondek has positively impacted
soldiers, peers, and superiors. Our
country has benefited tremendously
from his extraordinary leadership,
judgment, and passion. I join my col-
leagues today in honoring his dedica-
tion to our Nation and invaluable serv-
ice to the U.S. Congress as an Army
congressional liaison.
It has been a genuine pleasure to
have worked with SGM Derek Gondek
over the last 3 years. On behalf of a
grateful nation, I join my colleagues
today in recognizing and commending
Derek for his service to our country,
and we wish him all the best as he con-
tinues his service in his future endeav-
ors.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO BOBI GARRETT
∑ Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, today
I rise to recognize a great Coloradan,
Bobi Garrett who, after 21 years, is re-
tiring from the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory—NREL—in Golden,
Colorado.
NREL is a crown jewel of research
and development in the energy field,
where its employees show up to work
each day dedicated to finding solutions
to the problems that we currently face
not just in Colorado, but the United
States and the world as well. Bobi has
been with NREL since 1998, starting as
the associate director for strategic de-
velopment and analysis and is cur-
rently the deputy laboratory director
of strategic programs and partnership,
as well as chief operations officer—
COO—of the facility. Bobi’s work is
vital to the performance and effective-
ness of NREL, and her extensive exper-
tise in the energy field has been instru-
mental in the laboratory’s success.
Bobi started her career in energy and
engineering when she graduated from
Montana State University in 1976 with
a degree in chemical engineering. She
was just one of seven women in her en-
gineering class. In addition to her
NREL service, Bobi serves as an am-
bassador for Clean Energy Education
and Empowerment, a program that
helps women with careers in energy,
and currently as a board member of
CO-LABS, an organization dedicated to
increasing Colorado’s global standing
in research and technology.
Bobi has worked tirelessly in her ca-
reer to ensure that the future is bright-
er for generations to come. Her dedica-
tion to this effort earned her a spot in
Denver Business Journal’s ‘‘Top
Women in Energy’’ in 2015, a well-de-
served honor. We are proud to have
Bobi in the great State of Colorado,
and we look forward to her future ef-
forts to make the world a better
place.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and
were referred or ordered to lie on the
table as indicated:
POM–160. A concurrent resolution adopted
by the Legislature of the State of Texas urg-
ing the United States Congress to enact H.R.
613 and S. 164, the TRICARE Reserve and Se-
lect Improvement Act; to the Committee on
Armed Services.
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 74
Whereas, Men and women with full-time
careers who are also reservists in the Texas
National Guard or another reserve compo-
nent of the United States armed forces pro-
vide a valuable service to Texas and the na-
tion; and
Whereas, Also providing a valuable service
to Texas and the nation are men and women
who have made the reserves of the armed
forces of the United States their full-time
career; these military technicians provide
day-to-day readiness and training in reserve
component units and are considered to be
federal employees; and
Whereas, Unfortunately, federal employees
who are also reservists or who work full time
in a reserve component unit are ineligible
for TRICARE Reserve Select, the low-cost
health benefits plan offered to all other re-
serve component service members; instead,
these federal employees who are eligible for
a federal health benefits plan must use a
more expensive health benefits plan; and
Whereas, The cost difference between en-
rolling in TRICARE and a federal health ben-
efits plan can be significant in a family
budget; in a recent example, a full-time base
services manager at an Air National Guard
base estimated that she paid $4,700 more of
her $57,000 annual salary for a federal health
benefits plan than she would for TRICARE;
and
Whereas, To address the different treat-
ment of reserve component service members
who are federal employees, Congress is con-
sidering H.R. 613/S. 164, the TRICARE Re-
serve Select Improvement Act, to remove
the prohibition on eligibility for TRICARE
of members of the reserve components of the
armed forces who are eligible to enroll in a
federal health benefits plan; and
Whereas, Enacting the TRICARE Reserve
Select Improvement Act would reduce the fi-
nancial burden on valued members of the
Texas National Guard and other reserve
components of the United States armed
forces; now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the 86th Legislature of the
State of Texas hereby respectfully urge the
Congress of the United States to enact H.R.
613/S. 164, the TRICARE Reserve Select Im-
provement Act; and, be it further
Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state
forward official copies of this resolution to
the president of the United States, to the
president of the Senate and the speaker of
the House of Representatives of the United
States Congress, and to all the members of
the Texas delegation to Congress with the
request that this resolution be entered in the
Congressional Record as a memorial to the
Congress of the United States of America.
POM–161. A concurrent resolution adopted
by the Legislature of the State of Texas urg-
ing the President of the United States to
designate a state funeral for the last sur-
viving Medal of Honor recipient from World
War II; to the Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity and Governmental Affairs.
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 59
Whereas, World War II lasted from 1939
until 1945, and the United States entered the
war in 1941 following the attack on Pearl
Harbor; and
Whereas, Over 16 million Americans served
their country and its allies over the course
of the war; and
Whereas, The generation of men and
women who served our country in World War
II has been called ‘‘the greatest generation’’
for their selfless sacrifice; and
Whereas, The Medal of Honor is the high-
est military decoration that is awarded by
the United States government; and
Whereas, The Medal of Honor is presented
by the president of the United States, in the
name of Congress; and
Whereas, The Medal of Honor is only con-
ferred upon members of the United States
armed forces who distinguish themselves
through conspicuous gallantry and intre-
pidity at the risk of life above and beyond
the call of duty while engaged in action
against an enemy of the United States, while
engaged in military operations involving
conflict with an opposing foreign force, or
while serving with friendly forces engaged in
an armed conflict against an opposing armed
force in which the United States is not a bel-
ligerent party; and
Whereas, More than 3,400 Medals of Honor
have been awarded to our nation’s bravest
soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coast
guardsmen since the creation of the award in
1861; and
Whereas, The Medal of Honor was awarded
to 473 Americans during World War II, and
only four of those 473 Americans are alive
today; and
Whereas, Charles H. Coolidge of Tennessee,
Francis S. Currey of New York, Robert D.
Maxwell of Oregon, and Hershel W. Williams
of West Virginia all served their country
with conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity
at the risk of life and therefore deserve the
gratitude of the American people; and
Whereas, The president of the United
States has the sole authority to designate a
state funeral; and
Whereas, Historically, the president of the
United States has designated state funerals
for former presidents, generals, and other ex-
traordinary Americans; and
Whereas, Designating a state funeral when
the last surviving World War II Medal of
Honor recipient dies would be a wonderful
way for the American people to unite and
honor all 16 million soldiers, sailors, and air-
men who served in our armed forces from
1941 to 1945; Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the 86th Legislature of the
State of Texas, hereby respectfully urge the
president of the United States to designate a
state funeral for the last surviving Medal of
Honor recipient from World War II; and, be it
further
Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state
forward official copies of this resolution to
the president of the United States, to the
president of the Senate and the speaker of
the House of Representatives of the United
States Congress, and to all the members of
the Texas delegation to Congress with the
request that this resolution be entered in the
Congressional Record as a memorial to the
Congress of the United States of America.

ing the United States Congress to repeal the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6991
December 11, 2019
Government Pension Offset and the Windfall
Elimination Provision of the Social Security
Act; to the Committee on Finance.
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 19
Whereas, Social Security is the foundation
for retirement income for tens of millions of
American workers and their families; nearly
two-thirds of the older Americans who re-
ceive program benefits rely on Social Secu-
rity for 50 percent or more of their total in-
come, and one-third rely on it for 90 percent
or more; among beneficiaries aged 80 and
older, 42 percent rely on Social Security for
nearly all of their income; and
Whereas, Two Social Security provisions,
however, the Government Pension Offset
(GPO), enacted in 1977, and the Windfall
Elimination Provision (WEP), enacted in
1983, severely and unfairly penalize recipi-
ents of public pensions; and
Whereas, The GPO effectively prohibits
some government retirees from collecting
both their own pension and full Social Secu-
rity benefits as a surviving spouse; an esti-
mated 9 out of 10 public employees affected
by the GPO lose their entire spousal benefit,
even though their spouses paid Social Secu-
rity taxes for many years; and
Whereas, The WEP reduces the Social Se-
curity benefit for public employees who did
not participate in Social Security while
working for the government, but who at
some time in their careers were in jobs
where they paid Social Security taxes for the
period required to qualify for retirement
benefits; the WEP can deprive a retiree of
nearly $450 a month in Social Security bene-
fits duly earned by that individual;
Whereas, Although these provisions were
intended to curtail the payment of windfall
benefits to highly paid government employ-
ees, in practice they have had and continue
to have devastating consequences for low-in-
come employees who worked for many years
as public servants; more than two million
government employees and retirees are af-
fected by either the GPO or the WEP or
both, and the repercussions are felt most
acutely in Texas and 14 other states where a
high proportion of public employees partici-
pate in state or municipal retirement sys-
tems that do not include Social Security;
and
Whereas, These punitive and discrimina-
tory provisions target hundreds of thousands
of teachers, police officers, firefighters, and
other public servants; although the vast ma-
jority of Texas school employees participate
in the state’s teacher retirement system and
therefore are not required to and do not par-
ticipate in the Social Security system, many
Texas teachers and other public school em-
ployees nonetheless have earned Social Secu-
rity benefits on their own behalf through
other employment, the WEP notwith-
standing, or would be entitled to spousal So-
cial Security benefits based on their spouses’
lifetime earnings were it not for the GPO
penalty; these provisions cause veteran
teachers to retire prematurely and discour-
age qualified individuals from entering the
teaching profession at precisely the time
that Texas and the nation face a severe
shortage of highly qualified educators; and
Whereas, The GPO and WEP as applied to
public employees are unreasonable and un-
just and will cause tens of thousands of gov-
ernment retirees to experience a diminished
quality of life or be forced to return to work
to make up for the effects of these provi-
sions; Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the 86th Legislature of the
State of Texas hereby respectfully urge the
Congress of the United States to repeal the
Government Pension Offset and the Windfall
Elimination Provision of the Social Security
Act; and, be it further
Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state
forward official copies of this resolution to
the president of the United States, to the
president of the Senate and the speaker of
the House of Representatives of the United
States Congress, and to all the members of
the Texas delegation to Congress with the
request that this resolution be officially en-
tered in the Congressional Record as a me-
morial to the Congress of the United States
of America.
POM–163. A resolution adopted by the Gen-
eral Assembly of the State of New Jersey
urging the United States Congress and the
President of the United States to enact H.R.
500 which prevents the IRS from collecting
taxes on any amount of student loan for-
given for deceased veterans; to the Com-
mittee on Finance.
ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION NO. 97
Whereas, Each member of the United
States Armed Forces serves our country to
protect the citizens of the United States and,
in 2015, there were over one million active
duty members of the Armed Forces; and
Whereas, If a service member sustains an
injury or illness while on active duty they
may be discharged and return home to pur-
sue higher educational opportunities; and
Whereas, Many service members embrace
the opportunity to pursue higher education
through the various tuition assistance pro-
grams and college funds offered to service
members, which may be used in combination
with federal and private student loans to pay
for the cost of college; and
Whereas, If a service member loses his or
her life as a result of an injury or illness sus-
tained while on active duty, the federal edu-
cation loans are forgiven under the Higher
Education Act and private loan companies
can choose to forgive the education loans;
and
Whereas, When an educational loan is for-
given the Internal Revenue Code categorizes
the amount of the loan as taxable gross in-
come for a cosigner on the loan, which can
include both family and friends of the de-
ceased service member; and
Whereas, Taxing loan forgiveness as in-
come can be burdensome to family members
and friends especially during a time when
they are grieving the loss of their loved one;
and
Whereas, Families of veterans who lost
their lives as a result of an illness or injury
sustained while serving on active duty have
already sacrificed so much for the United
States; and
Whereas, The federal bill øH.R. 2874¿ H.R.
500, named the ‘‘Andrew P. Carpenter Tax
Act,’’ would amend the Internal Revenue
Code to prevent the Internal Revenue Serv-
ice from collecting taxes on any amount of
student loan forgiven; and
Whereas, The federal bill will help to ease
the financial burden for individuals who are
already grieving for the loss of their loved
one: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the General Assembly of the State
of New Jersey:
1. This House respectfully urges the Presi-
dent and Congress of the United States to
enact øH.R. 2874¿ H.R. 500 which amends the
Internal Revenue Code to prevent the Inter-
nal Revenue Service from collecting taxes on
any amount of student loan forgiven for de-
ceased veterans.
2. Copies of this resolution, as filed with
the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted
by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the
President and Vice President of the United
States, the United States Secretary of De-
fense, the Majority and Minority Leader of
the United States Senate, the Speaker and
the Minority Leader of the United States
House of Representatives, and every member
of Congress from New Jersey.
POM–164. A resolution adopted by the
Council of the Village of Yellow Springs,
Ohio urging the United States Congress to
enact the Energy Innovation and Carbon
Dividend Act of 2019; to the Committee on
Finance.
POM–165. A resolution passed by the Coun-
cil of the City and County of Honolulu, Ha-
waii urging the United States Congress to
embrace the Treaty on the Prohibition of
Nuclear Weapons and make nuclear disar-
mament the centerpiece of the United
States’ national security policy; to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations.
POM–166. A petition from a citizen of the
State of Louisiana memorializing a resolu-
tion adopted by the Legislature of the State
of Louisiana urging the United States Con-
gress to support the initiative calling for ac-
curate, third-party application (app) ratings
and intuitive parental controls to better pro-
tect children from harmful online and mo-
bile device content; to the Committee on
Commerce, Science, and Transportation.
POM–167. A resolution adopted by the
Eastern Regional Conference of the Council
of State Governments urging the United
States Congress to approve H.R. 3631 Terri-
tories Health Care Improvement Act; to the
Committee on Finance.

State of Illinois relative to the solvency of
the Central States Pension Fund; to the

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION
By Mr. REED (for himself and
Ms. COLLINS):
S. 3028. A bill to amend the Higher
Education Act of 1965 to strengthen
Federal-State partnerships in postsec-
ondary education; to the Committee on
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions.
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today,
most jobs require some kind of postsec-
ondary credential, whether a certifi-
cate. an associate’s or bachelor’s de-
gree. an advanced or professional de-
gree, or an apprenticeship. Moreover.
the workplace is changing with auto-
mation, artificial intelligence, and the
so-called gig economy transforming
the nature of work. Yet, postsecondary
education seems increasingly risky or
out of reach for too many Americans.
That is why I am proud to be intro-
ducing the bipartisan Partnerships for
Affordability and Student Success
(PASS) Act with my colleague, Senator
COLLINS.
At a time when we need to equip peo-
ple with the foundational skills and
knowledge they need to succeed in this
changing environment, we see college
costs and student loan debt soaring. We
see too many students who start post-
secondary education unable to finish,
leaving them in debt but without a de-
gree or postsecondary credential. As a
result, we see public confidence in our
system of higher education declining.
According to a recent Pew Research
Center survey, 61 percent of Americans
say that our system of higher edu-
cation is headed in the wrong direc-
tion.
The federal government cannot solve
this crisis on its own. States are crit-
ical partners in making college acces-
sible. affordable, and accountable.
However, state funding for higher edu-
cation is lower today than it was be-
fore the onset of the Great Recession.
According to the latest State Higher
Education Finance report published by
the State Higher Education Executive
Officers. public colleges and univer-
sities have become more reliant on tui-
tion dollars for their operations. In
2008, 35.8 percent of general operating
costs were supported by tuition pay-
ments. In 2018, that percentage in-
creased to 46.6 percent. Today, in 27
states, tuition accounts for more than
half of all higher education revenue.
Moreover, the only federal-state part-
nership program for need-based finan-
cial aid—the Leveraging Educational
Assistance Partnership (LEAP) pro-
gram—has not received appropriations
since Fiscal Year 2010.
It is time to renew the federal-state
partnership for higher education, first
enacted in 1972 on a bipartisan basis.
The PASS Act will revitalize the fed-
eral-state partnership through a for-
mula grant to states with a focus on
need-based aid, grants to institutions
to improve student outcomes and re-
duce college costs, and public account-
ability.
In exchange for this new federal in-
vestment, states must make a commit-
ment to maintain their investment in
higher education and have a com-
prehensive plan for higher education
with measurable goals for access, af-
fordability, and student outcomes. At
least half of the funding must be dedi-
cated to need-based student financial
aid. States also have the option of
awarding grants to colleges and univer-
sities or partnerships between institu-
tions of higher education and non-prof-
it organizations to improve student
outcomes, including enrollment, com-
pletion, and employment. and to de-
velop innovative methods for reducing
college costs. I am pleased to have the
support of the National Association of
State Student Grant and Aid Pro-
grams, the Center for Law and Social
Policy, the Institute for Higher Edu-
cation Policy, the Association of Com-
munity College Trustees, and the Na-
tional Skills Coalition.
This generation is facing a crisis in
college affordability and student loan
debt. With the PASS Act, we are pro-
viding the resources and incentives for
states to take more responsibility to
address college affordability and stu-
dent loan debt and improve student
outcomes. I urge my colleagues to co-
sponsor this legislation and look for-
ward to working with them to include
these and other key reforms in the up-
coming reauthorization of the Higher
Education Act.

f
DELAWARE DAY AND
HEALTHCARE ENROLLMENT
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise
this evening with a very important re-
minder for many Delawareans and for
all Americans, but before I do that, I
want to say that today is December 11,
and 4 days ago was December 7. A lot of
people think of December 7 as Pearl
Harbor Day, and for many years of my
life, I did as well. It is also Delaware
Day. Senator CHRIS COONS, LISA BLUNT
ROCHESTER, and I are hosting a recep-
tion on Capitol Hill today, and we call
it ‘‘A Taste of Delaware.’’ We are invit-
ing folks to come and join us if they
would like.
The reason I mention Delaware Day
is because that was actually the day
Delaware became the first State to rat-
ify the Constitution. For 1 whole week,
we were the entire United States of
America. We kind of opened things up
and let the rest of the other 49 States
in, and I think it has worked out pretty
well most days since then.
If you look at the preamble of the
Constitution, it starts off with these
words: ‘‘We the people of these United
States, in order to form a more perfect
Union.’’ That is what it says. It doesn’t
say ‘‘to form a perfect Union; it says
‘‘to form a more perfect Union.’’ It
goes on to talk about the public wel-
fare and how we should be looking out
for the good of all our citizens.
The Constitution was ratified in a
place called the Golden Fleece Tavern
in Dover, DE, on December 7, 1787,
after 3 days of deliberation by about 25
or so Delawareans.
There is a fellow who used to be
President of Delaware—now we call
him Governor of Delaware—a fellow
named Caesar Rodney, who apparently
literally rode his horse from Dover,
DE, a few years earlier, past very near
to where the Golden Fleece Tavern
stood for many years. He rode his horse
past the Golden Fleece Tavern on his
way to Philadelphia to cast the tie-
breaking vote in favor of the Declara-
tion of Independence.
The words in the Declaration of Inde-
pendence were largely written by
Thomas Jefferson and include these
words: ‘‘life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness.’’ It is hard to have life, lib-
erty, and much happiness without ac-
cess to good healthcare or without
good health.
I mention these words because that
goes back to the founding of our coun-
try, the Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution itself particu-
larly, the preamble of the Constitution,
which makes clear that we ought to be
looking out for the welfare of our peo-
ple.
I stand before us today reminding us
that if we don’t have good health and if
we don’t have access to healthcare, it
is pretty hard to be happy, at least for
a lifetime.
I say that as sort of a preface to what
I want to say now, which is that not
everybody who is eligible for
healthcare who needs healthcare is
covered. We have a lot of people who
get their healthcare from employer-
provided plans. We have 300 million
people in all who get healthcare cov-
erage in this country—half of them
from employer-provided plans, about 25
percent from Medicaid, about 15 per-
cent from Medicare—and there is about
another 10 percent who in some cases
don’t have any coverage. About 20 mil-
lion people have no coverage.
A lot of people now get their cov-
erage from exchanges. Every State has

A bunch of people use qualified com-
munity health centers in States on the
east coast, in the Midwest, and across
America. Whether you have 10 cents or
$10,000, you can get healthcare at these
places, and that is good.
But a lot of people who could sign up
and get their healthcare in market-
places in each State don’t know about
it. There is an opportunity to enroll in
the marketplaces and get healthcare
coverage by midnight on this coming
Sunday, on December 15. I just want to
spend a couple of minutes reminding
people who don’t have coverage to do
that and tell them why it is a good deal
for them and their families.
There is some good news here. The
good news is that all across our coun-
try, folks have 4 more days to sign up.
There is also some more good news,
and that is that after going up, up, up
for years, the cost of premiums in the
exchanges and marketplaces actually
dropped this year. In most market-
places, I think the average reduction is
about 4 percent. And for the next year,
in more than half a dozen States, pre-
miums will be coming down by double
digits. In Delaware, the cost of
healthcare in our marketplace, start-
ing with coverage beginning January 1,
will be down by 19 percent.
What has happened here is that after
a number of years where healthcare in-
surers were dropping out of the busi-
ness of offering coverage in the mar-
ketplaces, they are starting to offer
coverage again. Twenty-three insurers
offered coverage in States this year
that hadn’t been offering coverage. Be-
ginning January 1, I think about 45
more will start providing coverage.
That means we are going to have some
competition for customers, for folks
who need insurance, and that competi-
tion will help create what I call a vir-
tuous cycle, helping to bring down
costs even more. More choices means
more competition. That is a good thing
for our consumers and States across
America.
But wait, there is more. This year,
three out of four customers can find a
plan for less than—are you ready for
this?—75 bucks a month. Think about
that. Customers can find a plan in the
marketplace on the exchange for less
than 75 bucks a month.
Some people might be wondering
whether the Affordable Care Act mar-
ketplace is the right choice for them or
their loved ones. That is a good ques-
tion to ask. The marketplace provides
quality, affordable healthcare coverage
for Americans who don’t receive afford-
able health insurance through their
employer.
For instance, last Friday, a couple of
people I have been talking to in my
State just in the last week or so about
healthcare coverage—I was down at a
place called Lewes, DE, which was first
colonized by the Dutch 400 years ago. It
was the first town and the first city,
Lewes, DE—I met there a fellow who is
a self-employed artist. His name is
G.W. Thompson, and his life was for-
ever changed by the Affordable Care
Act when he was able to find affordable
and comprehensive health insurance.
For folks that are waiting to start a
business and need healthcare insur-
ance, I would encourage you to do this:
Visit HealthCare.gov—I will say that
again, HealthCare.gov—today. Find a
plan that works for you. You have got
plenty of choices.
Earlier this year, I met a widower in
Delaware named Marie. She lives with
a preexisting condition. As it turns
out, there are tens of millions of people
in this country who live with a pre-
existing condition. For many, many
years, they didn’t have access to
healthcare because they had a pre-
existing condition. That is not the case
anymore. Folks who do have a pre-
existing condition, they can get access
to healthcare thanks to the excellent
staff at a place called Westside Family
Healthcare. That is one of the federally
qualified community health centers,
and they have a great place in Dela-
ware. Marie was able to go there and
enroll in an ACA plan that covers her
preexisting condition and helps to keep
her happy.
Let me just say to the folks across
the country, if you are 1 of 133 million
Americans living with a preexisting
condition, I urge you to visit, again,
HealthCare.gov, HealthCare.gov. Find
a plan that works for you. If you are a
young person who has just turned 26
and can no longer stay on your parents’
health plan, visit HealthCare.gov today
and find a plan that works for you. If
you or your family have tried to enroll
in Medicaid but did not qualify, visit
HealthCare.gov today and find a plan
that works for you.
Don’t forget, nearly 9 out of 10 cus-
tomers are eligible for financial help,
which could mean a big savings for you
and your family, but to that line, I said
this before—I am going to say it
again—make the call. The deadline to
enroll in affordable healthcare in one
of the marketplaces in your State is
this Sunday. It is Sunday at midnight.
So you have got 4 days and, depending
on which time zone you are living in,
maybe close to 6 hours in order to sign
up.
Don’t wait another day, though. Sign
up today. Go to HealthCare.gov now
through this Sunday, December 15, to
shop for a plan that will give you and
your family coverage through 2020. If
you sign up, sign up before midnight
this Sunday. You will have coverage
beginning January 1 through December
31 of next year.
I know there are a lot of things that
always have to get done before the end
of the year. This is one that I think is
too important to miss. It is too impor-
tant to miss. So one more time, visit
HealthCare.gov to find healthcare cov-
erage that works for you and your fam-
ily’s needs and your budget, regardless
of what State you live in, if you have
no coverage.
Mr. President, I want to end this by
saying, since the Affordable Care Act
was enacted, we have seen some—not
all—but some of our Republican friends
here in this body and across the coun-
try do their dead-level best to under-
mine the Affordable Care Act. Those ef-
forts have ramped up considerably
under the current administration. The
President and 18 Republican attorneys
general have gone so far as to file a
lawsuit that attempts to scrap the
healthcare law in its entirety.
That lawsuit is working its way
through the courts now, but it is im-
portant for everyone to know, despite
these efforts to sabotage our Nation’s
healthcare law, the Affordable Care
Act is still the law of the land. If you
want to sign up for coverage for the
next year, you can still do that until
midnight on Sunday. I don’t think
there is a reason not to sign up, and I
would urge anybody who’s out there
listening, watching, if you don’t have
coverage, let’s do it. Do it today, and
you will be glad you did.
The idea of life, liberty, and the pur-
suit to happiness will be a little bit
closer to being realized for you.
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

ator from Rhode Island.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I
rise again to call this Chamber to wake
up to the threat of climate change, and
in this particular case, to say about
the Paris agreement and to say in cho-
rus with literally millions of Ameri-
cans, we are still in.
In truth, America is still in the Paris
agreement. When you look at the
States that are still in and will honor
their commitments, when you look at
the cities that are still in and will
honor their commitments, when you
look at the companies and the univer-
sities that are still in, it is the vast
majority of the entire American econ-
omy. Despite President Trump’s fossil
fuel nonsense, we really are still in.
Last week, I traveled to Madrid with
Speaker PELOSI and the delegation of
House committee chairs and climate
leaders for the U.N. Conference of the
Parties—what is called the COP—to
support the Paris agreement climate
goals. The mood in Spain was opti-
mistic. There was a somber confidence.
The Trump administration, of course,
has begun the process of withdrawing
the United States from the Paris cli-
mate accord.
That is an abandonment from our
American tradition of international
leadership and adherence to higher
ideals. It is abandonment of our own
national security imperatives and
economy well-being. This abandonment
demeans the Nation that has from
John Winthrop to Ronald Reagan
called itself a ‘‘city on a hill.’’
Our military well understands the
national security imperative. Back in
2013, Admiral Samuel Locklear, the
commander of the U.S. forces in the
Pacific, warned that upheaval related

to climate change ‘‘is probably the
most likely thing that is going to hap-
pen . . . that will cripple the security
environment’’—‘‘the most likely
thing.’’
He added, ‘‘You have the real poten-
tial here in the not-too-distant future
of nations displaced by rising sea level
. . . If it goes bad, you could have hun-
dreds of thousands or millions of people
displaced and then security will start
to crumble pretty quickly.’’
That command is still concerned
about it. Preparing for these risks was
a centerpiece of a recent Indo-Pacific
Command briefing I attended at their
headquarters in Hawaii.
To understand the threat to our
economy, we need only ask our govern-
ment-backed mortgage institution,
Freddie Mac. Freddie Mac predicts that
rising sea levels will prompt a crash in
coastal property values, greater than
the housing crash that caused the 2008
financial crisis. That warning by
Freddie Mac is echoed by the biggest,
most important financial institutions
in the world, both in the United States
in the Federal Reserve system and
abroad.
The Bank of England, the Bank of
France, the Bank of Canada, and Euro-
pean Central Bank, are all warning of
‘‘systemic’’ economic risks from cli-
mate change. ‘‘Systemic,’’ that is cen-
tral banker speak for something that
poses a risk to the entire economy, per-
haps from stranded fossil fuel assets
when the market for fossil fuel dries
up, perhaps from a coastal property
value crash when flood risk becomes
uninsurable and properties
unmortgageable.
Against this national security imper-
ative and this economic threat, the
Trump administration leaving the
Paris climate accord is a historically
dumb and destructive move, particu-
larly from a guy—Trump—who one dec-
ade ago called climate change ‘‘sci-
entifically irrefutable,’’ that is a quote.
‘‘Scientifically irrefutable and its con-
sequences catastrophic and irrevers-
ible,’’ that is a quote as well.
The Pelosi delegation—here we are at
the COP25—included powerful House
chairmen, like Chairman PALLONE and
Chairman GRIJALVA, Chairman JOHN-
SON and Chairman CASTOR and, of
course, the most senior and influential
Democrat in America, House Speaker
NANCY PELOSI.
Speaker PELOSI’s presence at the
COP resounded not only because of her
clout and standing, but because it sig-
naled the broad, true consensus of the
United States of America in favor of
climate action. At the State level, at
the city level, across the public, and in
much of corporate America, we are in-
deed still in.
Indeed, at the Madrid conference
right now, as I give this speech, are
representatives for thousands of Amer-
ican businesses, investors managing
trillions of dollars, hundreds of Amer-
ican municipalities and counties, top
American colleges and universities,
dozens of American faith groups, Amer-
ica’s largest healthcare organizations,
and 20 American States and Tribes.
Again, all told, it is the vast bulk of
the American economy, and it still is.
America, unfortunately, at least in
Congress, has to fight our way through
a persistent blockade paid for by the
fossil fuel industry. Don’t believe their
happy talk about acting on climate.
There is a slogan that one of their
trade groups has come up with. You see
it at National Airport. You see it on
billboards. It is popping up everywhere.
The slogan is: ‘‘We are on it.’’
No, they are not. They are not even
close to on it. In fact, they are the op-
posite. They are on the wrong side.
They are funding false science denial
and ridiculous amounts of simple polit-
ical obstruction. They are paying for
that. The statements from their lips do
not match the expenditure of their
funds. The expenditure of their funds is
still dedicated to their political appa-
ratus of denial and obstruction.
Ultimately, however, we will prevail.
The America that the international
community knows and counts on—the
America of leadership, the America of
progress, the America of confidence,
the America of clean and green energy
and innovation—that America will be
back and will prevail. ‘‘Our commit-
ment to take action on the climate cri-
sis is ironclad,’’ said Speaker PELOSI in
Madrid. It is. Soon enough, that com-
mitment will topple the castle of fos-
sil-fuel-funded climate denial and ob-
struction that surrounds us today here
in Congress.
I yield the floor.

HONORING 100 YEARS OF THE
BOLL WEEVIL MONUMENT IN EN-
TERPRISE, ALABAMA
HON. MARTHA ROBY
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 11, 2019
Mrs. ROBY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor and celebrate the 100th Anniversary of
the Boll Weevil Monument in the City of Enter-
prise, Alabama.
In 1882, John Henry Carmichael founded
the city of Enterprise. Early on, Enterprise
thrived primarily due to agriculture, specifically
the cotton crop. Cotton was the catalyst that
spurred the development of water and electric
systems, the growth of the schools, and the
opening of new businesses in the community.
Enterprise, Alabama like many other towns
and cities emerging in the southern United
States, were economically dependent on the
prosperity of the cotton crop.
The Boll Weevil, a small insect native to
Mexico, made its way to the southern United
States in the early 1900s, devastating cotton
buds and destroying the viability of the crop
along the way. Enterprise was not spared, as
the Boll Weevil ravished Coffee County’s cot-
ton production and the city’s agricultural foun-
dation. The farmers and families of Enterprise
suffered greatly from this economic blow, but
they remained determined and solution-ori-
ented.
In pursuit of relief from the economic hard-
ship for the citizens of Enterprise, banker H.M.
Sessions, county Agent John Pittman, and sci-
entist Dr. George Washington Carver encour-
aged agricultural diversification. With favorable
soil and weather conditions, relief came in the
form of peanut seeds, which were brought to
Enterprise in 1916 and grown by local farmer,
C.W. Baston. In just one year, the peanut in-
dustry exploded in Enterprise, yielding over
five million dollars and making the city a top
peanut producer nationwide.
The Boll Weevil Monument that many in the
community pass by every day was erected to
recognize the role of the Boll Weevil in trans-
forming Enterprise and compelling its citizens
to ‘‘triumph over adversity.’’ This central monu-
ment symbolizes the adaptability, resiliency,
and determination that embody the character
of Enterprise and its citizens, past and
present.
Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to join my
constituents and the residents of Enterprise to
honor the centennial of the Boll Weevil Monu-
ment on Main Street. This monument stands
as a reminder to us all of what can be accom-
plished in the face of adversity. I am proud
and forever grateful to represent this city and
the people of the Second Congressional Dis-
trict in the United States House of Represent-
atives.
RECOGNIZING SUPERVISOR
LAURENCE CRABTREE
HON. TOM McCLINTOCK
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 11, 2019
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I rise
to recognize Supervisor Laurence Crabtree,
who is retiring after 50 years of service as an
indispensable steward of our forests.
Laurence’s passion for forest service began
in his teenage years, when he worked as a
smokechaser in a youth employment program
at Clearwater National Forest in 1969. After
working in a variety of seasonal positions as
a firefighter, timber cruiser, and forester, Lau-
rence spent twenty years as a District Timber
Management Officer and District Resource Of-
ficer on Lassen National Forest.
After serving as a District Ranger at
Humbolt-Toiyabe and Modoc National Forests,
followed by two years at Plumas National For-
est, Laurence took his skills to my congres-
sional district, serving as Forest Supervisor of
the Eldorado National Forest for more than six
years. Indeed, Laurence has spent his life as
an ardent servant of our forests and the mil-
lions of Americans who visit them each year.
Laurence was an explorer of our lands just
as he was a protector, and his list of accom-
plishments speaks volume to his work. He dis-
covered a rare moth in the Sierras that had
not been seen for 140 years, then discovered
a new moth in Nevada, aptly named
Pelochrista crabtreei. He was awarded a Proc-
lamation of Commendation from the Lassen
County Board of Supervisors for his commu-
nity involvement as the Big Valley District
Ranger, as well as a Quality Step Increase for
‘‘furthering the trust and collaborative relation-
ships with Central Nevada Counties and
Tribes.’’ One of his proudest accomplishments
was dedicating the Olympic Training Center at
Echo Summit in El Dorado County as a Cali-
fornia Historical Landmark to honor the special
site used for training by America’s top ath-
letes.
As wildfires ravaged nearly every corner of
California, Laurence was at the forefront of
making our forests environmentally sound and
recreationally accommodating. Following the
2014 King Fire, Laurence’s role as an Agency
Administrator contributed immensely to the
King Fire Restoration Project, which quickly
began a complete reforestation process. His
work over the past six years in particular has
led Eldorado National Forest to become a re-
gional leader in timber production and haz-
ardous fuel treatment. He has received mul-
tiple certificates of merit for excellence in lead-
ership and management, highlighting his devo-
tion to protecting the communities and unique
wildlife that make our western forests so spe-
cial.
Laurence’s passion for serving his commu-
nity extends beyond the forests. In both Cali-
fornia and Nevada, Laurence served on
school boards and chambers of commerce.
Now, Laurence and his wife Denice will be re-
turning to Big Valley, where he will undoubt-
edly continue his active involvement with his
community while also spending more time with
his family.
Gifford Pinchot was explicit in his first
maxim for foresters, ‘‘A public official is there
to serve the public and not run them.’’ Lau-
rence Crabtree has done just that for 50
years, and I thank him for decades of devotion
to safeguarding our national forests for the
use and enjoyment of the American people.

HONORING MR. GREGORY RICH
HON. JIMMY GOMEZ
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 11, 2019
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Mr. Gregory Rich, who after a 40-
year career is retiring from the global
healthcare company, Grifols. As a long-
standing company executive, Greg has dedi-
cated his professional life to serving patients
through an unwavering commitment to excel-
lence, integrity, and innovation.
My congressional district in Los Angeles is
home to one of Grifols’ three plasma-thera-
peutics manufacturing facilities and U.S. cor-
porate offices. This is where Greg has spent
the majority of his career. Greg’s tenure in Los
Angeles was marked by major investments in
Grifols’ facilities, the local community and
most importantly, the people of El Sereno and
surrounding neighborhoods.
A native of southern California, Greg grad-
uated from California State Polytechnic Uni-
versity in Pomona, California with a Bachelor
of Science degree in accounting and data
processing. Greg began his career as an audi-
tor with Touche, Ross & Company, and later
joined Alpha Therapeutic Corporation as direc-
tor of corporate planning. Greg then relocated
to Barcelona, Spain, to facilitate the com-
pany’s joint venture with Laboratory Grifols,
serving as the assistant director of finance.
Greg was promoted to the position of Co-
President of Laboratory Grifols, and remained
in this position until returning to Alpha Thera-
peutic Corporation as vice president and gen-
eral manager of international operations. He
later became senior vice president and gen-
eral manager for the parent company of Alpha
Therapeutic Corporation.
In 2001, Greg became president and chief
executive officer of Grifols USA, and currently
serves as President and CEO of Grifols
Shared Services North America, Inc. Through-
out his tenure with Grifols and its predecessor
companies, Greg has exemplified a culture of
service to his colleagues in the U.S, Spain,
and around the world. His collegiality and
dedication to the values and mission of the
company will be missed.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in congratulating Greg and his wife Debo-
rah on a remarkable career. We wish them
every success in the future.

HONORING VIDAL DÁVILA
HON. DUSTY JOHNSON
OF SOUTH DAKOTA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 11, 2019
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor
Vidal Dávila for his retirement from the Na-
tional Park Service after almost forty-five years
of service.
Mr. Dávila has been a passionate servant
for our nation’s national parks his entire life.
He grew up regularly visiting national parks,
cultivating a passion for protecting and pre-
serving public lands from a young age.
Mr. Dávila has served in an impressive
number of public lands across the United
States, including Texas’ Amistad Recreation
Area, Texas’ Big Bend National Park, and
Texas’ Guadalupe Mountains National Park.
He also served in the Southwest Regional Of-
fice in New Mexico, the Great Basin National
Park in Nevada, and, of course, South Dako-
ta’s Wind Cave National Park.
Wind Cave has greatly benefited from Mr.
Dávila’s leadership over the past twelve years.
Mr. Dávila became Wind Cave’s super-
intendent in 2007 and was awarded Super-
intendent of the Year for Natural Resources by
the Midwest Regional Director for his hard
work and dedication to the park. He also has
served as a member of the NPS Midwest Re-
gional Office Bison Leadership Team since
2013 where he helped facilitate coordination
between bison parks and National Park Serv-
ice leadership.
I commend Mr. Dávila for his outstanding
record of service, dedication, and hard work. I
extend my deepest congratulations to Vidal
Dávila for his contributions to South Dakota
and our nation’s parks.

RECOGNIZING THE IOTA CHAPTER
OF PHI BETA SIGMA FRATER-
NITY INCORPORATED ON THEIR
100 YEAR ANNIVERSARY
HON. G.K. BUTTERFIELD
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 11, 2019
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, I rise
to recognize the 100th anniversary of the Iota
Chapter of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Incor-
porated. The Iota Chapter was chartered on
December 11, 1919, on the historic campus of
Shaw University, making it the first Greek-let-
tered organization at Shaw, the ninth chapter
in the history of Phi Beta Sigma, and the sec-
ond chapter in North Carolina.
The Iota Chapter was founded by Jesse W.
Lewis, who eventually became the fraternity’s
seventh International President. Mr. Lewis
wanted to organize a Greek-lettered fraternity
on Shaw’s campus that exemplified the ideals
of brotherhood, scholarship, and service and
Phi Beta Sigma was a perfect fit. Sigma broth-
ers to this day, hold deep convictions to use
Phi Beta Sigma’s ideals to better their commu-
nities.
The Iota Chapter has produced many promi-
nent alumni who have contributed enormously
in the fields of medicine, speech pathology,
education, and dentistry, including my father,
Dr. G. K. Butterfield, Sr. who entered Shaw in
September 1919 after fighting in World War
One. On his 22nd birthday, February 9, 1922,
he was initiated into the Iota Chapter. My fa-
ther graduated from Shaw in 1922 and grad-
uated from Meharry Medical College as a den-
tist in 1927. He returned to North Carolina,
married my mother whom he met at Shaw,
and moved to Wilson, North Carolina where
he remained until he passed away at the age
of 95. During his lifetime, my father was active
in Phi Beta Sigma and became a well-re-
spected civil rights leader in our hometown,
and was even elected to the Wilson City
Council in 1953 during the dark days of seg-
regation.
Shaw University was the first historically
Black institution of higher education in North
Carolina and is among the oldest historically
black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the
nation. In many ways, Shaw, with the help of
the Iota Chapter, has been an institutional pio-
neer for civil rights. During the 1960’s, Shaw
and members of the Iota Chapter were lead-
ers of numerous marches and demonstrations
that took place on the streets of Raleigh and
across North Carolina in the fight for civil
rights and the end of segregation.
Phi Beta Sigma has blossomed into an
international organization of leaders. No longer
a singular entity, members of the Fraternity
have been instrumental in the establishment of
the Phi Beta Sigma National Foundation, the
Phi Beta Sigma Federal Credit Union, and the
Fraternity’s sister organization, the Zeta Phi
Beta Sorority, which was founded in 1920.
Madam Speaker, to this day, the Iota Chap-
ter continues to be a vital chapter of Phi Beta
Sigma and a leading role model for community
service in North Carolina. I ask my colleagues
to join me in celebrating the Iota Chapter of
Phi Beta Sigma on its centennial.

Navy.
For the past year, LCDR Ragsdale served
on my staff as a Congressional Defense Fel-
low. A 2007 graduate of the United States
Naval Academy, LCDR Ragsdale is a proud
Surface Warfare Officer who served in MCM
Crew BULWARK and onboard USS COM-
STOCK (LSD–45) and USS BENFOLD (DDG–
65). During his assignment in my office, LCDR
Ragsdale provided senior-level input for de-
fense, veterans, foreign affairs and intelligence
matters. Additionally, he executed his work as
a liaison to the constituents of Virginia’s First
Congressional District with distinction.
Furthermore, LCDR Ragsdale provided ex-
ceptional support to me as a staff liaison to
the House Armed Services Committee in my
role as the Seapower and Projection Forces
Subcommittee Ranking Member. LCDR
Ragsdale dutifully provided me with guidance
on what the Navy’s path forward should be in
critical areas such as training, readiness, and
manning. His recent experience in the surface
community was invaluable to my work in Con-
gress.
As the Co-Chair of the Congressional Ship-
building Caucus and the Co-Chair of the
Navy-Marine Corps Caucus, I relied on LCDR
Ragsdale to organize quarterly events with
government, military, and private sector lead-
ers. These events allowed key decisionmakers
to work together for the advancement of our
future Naval Officers as well as the construc-
tion and repair of the ships on which they will
serve.
LCDR Ragsdale also directly contributed to
my goal of providing excellent constituent
service to the people of the First District. He
was responsible for bringing numerous con-
stituent inquiries to a successful conclusion,
and he leveraged his personal and operational

experience in the Navy to respond to the most
challenging inquiries. In addition to his efforts
locally, LCDR Ragsdale took on projects with
regional, state, and national implications, dem-
onstrating his ability to view a challenge from
many angles and develop innovative solutions.
LCDR Ragsdale’s work ethic, duty to mis-
sion, and commitment to servant leadership is
without equal. I believe that his personal drive
to achieve excellence in his work has and will
set a very high standard for his peers. I would
also like to thank LCDR Ragsdale for the serv-
ice and sacrifice he has made, and continues
to make, both for our Nation and our great
Navy. His impeccable integrity, boundless
work ethic, and loyal devotion to duty earned
him the respect and admiration of my staff and
the First District of Virginia. I have no doubt
that LCDR Ragsdale will continue to serve the
Navy honorably and with distinction.
I wish Chris and his wife Andrea the best of
luck as they continue their journey together as
a Navy family. It was an honor and a pleasure
having Chris serve on my staff. We all can
sleep soundly at night knowing that members
of our all-volunteer force like Chris stand
ready to defend our country and take the fight
to our enemies; far away from their families
and the comforts of the United States of
America.
I thank LCDR Christopher Ragsdale for
doing a fantastic job. Best of luck to him and
may God bless him, his family, and all the
Sailors he is charged with leading.

TELEVISION VIEWER PROTECTION
ACT OF 2019
SPEECH OF
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, December 10, 2019
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support
of H.R. 5035. I thank the leadership of the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee and Commu-
nications and Technology Subcommittee for
reaching this bipartisan agreement.
This bill includes important consumer pro-
tections based on my bill, the TRUE Fees Act,
that will provide consumers with an ‘‘all-in’’
price before a consumer signs up for cable or
satellite TV. This includes all fees and taxes.
The bill also gives consumers 24 hours to
cancel without penalty.
The average consumer pays $450 a year in
opaque and confusing company-imposed fees
on their cable bill (excluding taxes), according
to Consumer Reports. This is a game of bait
and switch and this legislation ends it.
As is the nature of a compromise, not all of
the protections from my TRUE Fees Act were
included, but the legislation takes an important
step forward in providing consumers with
transparency.
Another provision of H.R. 5035 empowers
groups of small cable operators to negotiate
better prices for consumers and decreases the
likelihood of broadcast blackouts. This is
something Mr. SCALISE and I championed in
our bipartisan Modern Television Act. It is im-
portant because large broadcaster networks
take advantage of small cable operators dur-
ing negotiations, leading to increased costs for
consumers. Worse, stalemates in negotiations
cause broadcast blackouts.
While I’m pleased we’re taking this impor-
tant step, I also hope our Committee will re-
visit the issue of broader reforms to the video
marketplace soon. Specifically, we need to
protect consumers from other harmful prac-
tices, such as broadcast blackouts, and mod-
ernize outdated laws and regulations that hurt
consumers in their wallets. Mr. SCALISE and I
propose such reforms in our bill H.R. 3994,
the Modern Television Act.
So far this year, broadcasters have caused
nearly 300 blackouts, which is a record and
more than double the number from five years
prior. Furthermore, cable and satellite compa-
nies paid over $11 billion in retransmission
consent fees so far this year, which is also
double from five years prior. Consumers are
paying more than ever while blackouts are
more frequent than ever. We must revisit
these issues and protect consumers from
blackouts and rising costs.
I support this legislation and urge my col-
leagues to do the same.

IN HONOR OF FLOYD BURTON’S
100TH BIRTHDAY
HON. RICHARD HUDSON
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 11, 2019
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Mr. Floyd Burton and wish him a very
happy 100th birthday.
The advent of World War II was a time that
not only shaped the course of our country but
the lives of many Americans, including Mr.
Burton. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he
was one of the many patriots who felt com-
pelled to serve our great nation and joined the
Army in 1942.
During his military career, he served as a
technician corporal and assisted various cam-
paigns throughout Germany, France, and the
United Kingdom. Mr. Burton showed endless
bravery and courage in his pursuit of peace
across the globe.
After completing active duty, Mr. Burton re-
turned home to North Carolina where he and
his wife Dorothy raised two daughters, Delores
and Barbara. He then opened a successful
business in Spencer where he provided our
community with retail furniture for over 38
years.
Mr. Burton remained an active community
leader and has been involved in the Free-
masons of North Carolina, Rowan Shrine
Club, and served as Master of the Salisbury
Masonic Lodge. Passionate about educating
our youth, he helped establish scholarship
programs with the Masonic Home for Children
at Oxford, Baptist Children’s Home of North
Carolina, and Catawba College.
Mr. Burton was born on December 28, 1919
and represents the best our nation has to
offer. I am proud to join our community today
in honoring all that he has accomplished over
the last 100 years.
Madam Speaker, please join me today in
thanking Mr. Floyd Burton for his service and
wishing him a happy 100th birthday.

HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN
OF ARKANSAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 11, 2019
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Randy Veach’s decades of
service with the Arkansas Farm Bureau.
Mr. Veach spent 20 years working for the
grassroots agricultural organization, 11 of
those years as a state president. He and his
wife, Thelma, are a tremendous resource to
our state through their advocacy and commit-
ment to Arkansas farmers and ranchers.
Mr. Veach has always embodied the mis-
sion of the Farm Bureau by educating the
public on the value of the agricultural industry
in the state. I appreciate his dedication to his
family, to Arkansas agriculture, and to the
people we serve and love.
I personally worked with Mr. Veach over the
years and saw his lifelong commitment to
service firsthand. He is a powerful reminder of
the impact one can have on our communities.
I’m honored to recognize him for the years he
has given to the state of Arkansas, and wish
him all the best in retirement.

Since 2004, Fort Bend Focus Magazine has

My wife, Nancy, has even written for Fort
Bend Focus from time to time.
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-
sional District of Texas, congratulations again
to the Fort Bend Focus for keeping us in-
formed on what’s happening in our commu-
nity. Here’s to celebrating fifteen years of ex-

IN HONOR OF CHARLES B. RYAN
III
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 11, 2019
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in
honor of Charles B. Ryan III, a small business
owner who died on November 27, 2019 at the
age of 90. Mr. Ryan made the Roanoke Valley
a better place to live thanks to his contribu-
tions.
Mr. Ryan was born on August 14, 1929.
After graduating from Dartmouth University in
1951, he married his beloved wife, Ms. Susan
Thomas. Mr. Ryan started his career working
for Firestone Tire and Rubber, before moving
to Mohawk Tire and Rubber in Arkansas. The
experience Mr. Ryan obtained from his first
two jobs prepared him for the creation of a
new tire plant. In 1968, Mr. Ryan selected
Salem, Virginia as the site of the new plant.
He oversaw the construction of the new plant
and served as the General Manager. After
working there for a few years, Mr. Ryan be-
came a manufacturing consultant. The Mo-
hawk tire facility is now owned by the Yoko-
hama Tire Corporation and remains a signifi-
cant employer in the Roanoke Valley.
Mr. Ryan was a skilled athlete and sports
was one of his biggest hobbies. He and his
wife Sue devoted countless hours to amateur
sports to the benefit of others in the commu-
nity. Their involvement in expanding opportuni-
ties for swimming allowed more young people,
including myself, to enjoy this activity. Mr.
Ryan loved golf so much that he served on
the Board of Directors at his local club, Hidden
Valley Country Club. He decided to create a
business devoted to his hobby by opening a
store in Roanoke called The Sports Shop,
which provided medals and trophies for many
of the area’s competitions.
After a few years of consulting and running
The Sports Shop, Mr. Ryan moved to Win-
chester, Virginia where he managed the
Stowe-Woodward plant. After receiving a mas-
ter’s degree in accounting from Georgetown
University, Mr. Ryan returned to Salem and
used his new degree to open an accounting
business in Roanoke.
Mr. Ryan is survived by his wife, Sue, his
children Deborah Howard, C. William Ryan,
Thomas Ryan, and David Ryan, and his five
grandsons, Conklin and Adam Howard, Sean
Ryan, and Jack and Lukas Ryan. The Roa-
noke Valley and the Commonwealth of Vir-
ginia were fortunate to have this fine commu-
nity member and small business owner among
the citizenry. I offer my condolences to the
Ryan family on their loss.

ENGINEERING BIOLOGY RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2019
SPEECH OF
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, December 9, 2019
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support
of H.R. 4373, the Engineering Biology Re-
search and Development Act. Engineering bi-
ology, or bioengineering, applies principles of
engineering to living matter in order to develop
new technology for a variety of applications.
Breakthroughs in bioengineering have led to
technologies that help many patients live fuller
lives, including prosthetic limbs, biologics,
micro-implants, medical imaging technology,
and other medical devices. The applications of
bioengineering also extend beyond medicine
to fields such as agriculture, environmental
science, and robotics, and I’m very proud to
represent Silicon Valley where such of this
cutting-edge research takes place.
While the United States has been a global
leader in bioengineering, we cannot be com-
placent as other countries, including China,
continue to invest heavily in research and de-
velopment.
H.R. 4373 will help maintain American lead-
ership in this critical field by establishing a fed-
eral bioengineering research initiative. It also
requires the Office of Science and Technology
Policy to coordinate with several agencies in-
cluding the National Science Foundation, the
National Institutes of Health, and NASA to de-
velop a national bioengineering strategy.
The downside of this legislation is that it
does not include any new spending. I look for-
ward to working with my colleagues to ensure
we provide these agencies with the funding
they need to make this initiative succeed.
China now spends 30 times as much on re-
search and development as it did 25 years
ago, and while the federal government has
also increased its spending on science in real
terms over the same timeframe, Congress
must make the necessary investments to
maintain our country’s global leadership in bio-
engineering and other high tech fields.
I thank Chairwoman JOHNSON for her impor-
tant work on H.R. 4373, urge my colleagues to
support this legislation, and urge them to pro-
vide the resources necessary for a robust U.S.
bioengineering effort.
12 DAYS OF SALT—DAY 6: NEW
JERSEY LEAGUE OF MUNICI-
PALITIES RESOLUTION
HON. MIKIE SHERRILL
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 11, 2019
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, to con-
clude my earlier remarks on the 12 Days of
SALT, I include in the RECORD a resolution
from the New Jersey League of Municipalities
urging this Congress to remove the federal
cap on State and Local Tax deductions.
NEW JERSEY STATE LEAGUE OF MUNICIPALI-
TIES CONFERENCE RESOLUTION NO. 2019–14
RESOLUTION URGING CONGRESS TO RESTORE THE
FULL DEDUCTIBILITY OF STATE AND LOCAL
TAXES
Whereas, our tax obligation is an issue
that concerns all residents in every munici-
pality in the state of New Jersey; and
Whereas, the deduction for state and local
taxes (SALT) has been a feature of the tax
code for more than l00 years, with the first
federal income tax form in 1913 allowing tax-
payers to deduct state and local taxes, one of
only six deductions allowed at the time, and
even the federal Civil War tax in 1862 in-
cluded a deduction for SALT; and
Whereas, this important provision ensures
against double taxation and reflects manda-
tory tax payments, which support public
services that benefit all citizens, such as K–
12 schools, law enforcement and public safe-
ty, transportation and infrastructure, and
vital community and public health services;
and
Whereas, the SALT deduction is one of the
few provisions in the federal tax code that
recognizes the burden placed on states like
New Jersey, which provide significantly
more in federal tax revenue than they re-
ceive back in federal services and grants; and
Whereas, according to the New Jersey So-
ciety of Certified Public Accountants, in 2016
1.8 million, or 40 percent of New Jersey tax-
payers, deducted from their federal income
tax, their local prope1ty tax and state in-
come taxes, averaging $18,000 per deduction;
and
Whereas, the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs
Acts passed in 2017 capped the SALT deduc-
tion at $10,000; and
Whereas, many New Jersey Families relied
upon the federal SALT deduction to ensure
tax fairness, and capping the SALT deduc-
tion has placed an unfair burden on New Jer-
sey homeowners; and
Whereas, the SALT deduction cap present
a barrier to affordable homeownership in
New Jersey, impacting the ability of new,
young families to prosper in the future. Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, that the New Jersey State
League of Municipalities, in conference as-
sembled, urges Congress to restore the full
SALT deduction and provide more equitable
taxation once again to residents of New Jer-
sey; and be it further
Resolved, that copies of the resolution be
transmitted to our representatives in Con-
gress, the President of the United States, all
members of the New Jersey State Legisla-
ture, the Lieutenant Governor, and the Gov-
ernor of the State of New Jersey.

HON. PETER T. KING
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 11, 2019
Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to congratulate one of my constitu-
ents, Judge Phil Goglas, an ex-captain of the
Central Islip Fire Department (CIFD) who was
elected as the new Eastern Director of the
Fire Department Safety Officers Association
(FDSOA).
Judge Goglas is a former New York City
Transit Police Officer. He received his bach-
elor’s from St. John’s University and his Juris
Doctorate from Brooklyn Law School.
Judge Goglas was elected to the Suffolk
County District Court in 2010 and the Suffolk
County Court in 2014 where he currently pre-
sides.
Judge Goglas started his volunteer fire serv-
ice with the Wyandanch Volunteer Fire Com-
pany in 1979 and joined the Central Islip Fire
Department in 1993 and served as Captain of
Engine and Company 3 from 2000 to 2002.
Judge Goglas has been a member of the
FDSOA since 2010 and will be sworn in at the
annual general meeting held in conjunction
with the 2020 Health and Safety Conference
in Scottsdale, Arizona.
The Fire Department Safety Officers Asso-
ciation (FDSOA) was established in 1989 as a
non-profit association, whose mission is to
promote safety standards and practices in the
fire, rescue and emergency services commu-
nity. The association is led by a volunteer
board of directors. The association is dedi-
cated to the issues that affect the critical role
of the safety officer in protecting and pro-
moting the safety and health responsibilities of
fire departments, communities and first re-
sponders.
I call on my colleagues to join me in con-
gratulating Judge Goglas and continue to sup-
port our first responders who put their lives on
the line for the community.
