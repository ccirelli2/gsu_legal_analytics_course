CELEBRATING UCLA SOFTBALL’S
2019 NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP
HON. TED LIEU
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 2, 2019
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to celebrate the softball team from
the University of California, Los Angeles,
which took home the 2019 NCAA champion-
ship on the 4th of June against the University
of Oklahoma.
This year’s championship is the program’s
13th national championship and 118th overall
NCAA championship earned by a UCLA Bru-
ins team in any sport. With 12 NCAA Division
I titles, UCLA softball has the most champion-
ships of any school since softball became an
NCAA sport in 1982 and one of the most suc-
cessful teams on campus.
Coach Kelly Inouye-Perez and the team
should be proud of their accomplishments,
winning a Pac–12 championship along the
way and losing only six out of 62 games this
season. Bringing a national title back to Eas-
ton Stadium is a fitting end for the collegiate
careers for the seven graduating seniors on
this year’s team. I would also like to commend
pitcher Rachel Garcia for being named Colle-
giate Woman Athlete of the Year and receiv-
ing the Honda Cup on June 24.
I would like to sincerely congratulate the
UCLA softball team once again on winning the
national championship and wish them best of
luck next season.

HONORING D-DAY VETERAN
LLOYD DAVIS CARTER
HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 2, 2019
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor a remarkable man from
Northeast Georgia who courageously fought
on the front lines in Normandy on June 6,
1944.
Mr. Lloyd Davis Carter was raised to be a
farmer in Hull, Georgia, but, after the attack at
Pearl Harbor, he courageously decided to join
the Armed Forces. He began training with the
United States Army at the young age of 19.
His first assignment out of training was the
amphibious assault of North Africa followed by
the mission to daringly invade Sicily—led by
General Omar Bradley and General George
Patton. After returning to England for seven
months of intense combat training, Carter
eventually became one of the brave men who
stormed Omaha beach in Normandy with the
16th Infantry.
Mr. Carter barely survived being killed by
Nazi fire, escaping with the bones in his right
forearm shattered. He made it back to Amer-
ica with little more than his life and a small
copy of the New Testament that he kept in his
pocket throughout the fight. Carter accredits
his survival to the Lord looking after him, re-
flecting on his favorite Bible verse, Psalm 23.
To honor his bravery and valor, Mr. Carter
was awarded a Purple Heart, Silver Star and
Presidential Citation. His heroism on that day
changed the course of history as he fought to
protect not only our country’s freedom, but the
freedom of the world.
As we reflect upon his bravery, we are re-
minded to never take for granted the freedom
we hold so dear. Because of Mr. Carter and
the many other D-Day veterans, the free world
exists today.
Because of those brave patriots, our country
remains the strongest force of freedom the
world has ever witnessed. On behalf of the
people of the Ninth District of Georgia, I salute
Mr. Carter—alongside the thousands of other
men who fought that day—for his incredible
service to our country.

IN RECOGNITION OF CYNTHIA
CANTY FOR HER EXEMPLARY
SERVICE
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 2, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Cynthia Canty for her ex-
emplary service as a radio and TV host. Her
continued dedication to journalism is worthy of
commendation.
A lifelong resident of Detroit, Cynthia Canty
is the host of Michigan Radio’s Stateside talk
show and has dedicated her life to journalism
in a career spanning over 40 years. Prior to
working at Michigan Radio, she was a tele-
vision news anchor, producer, and radio host
in the Detroit area. In her various roles, she
has interviewed numerous influential figures
including governors, authors, musicians, and
experts in a variety of fields. Mrs. Canty has
received several awards for her work, includ-
ing an Emmy Award and honors from the
Michigan Association of Broadcasters, the As-
sociated Press, and the Detroit Press Club.
After her many years of service, Cynthia
Canty will retire from Michigan Radio at the
end of 2019.
Throughout her decorated career, Mrs.
Canty has explored critical issues impacting
the residents of Michigan. Her talent for en-
couraging thought-provoking dialogue has
been crucial in dissecting these important top-
ics. Beyond her work in journalism, Mrs. Canty
has dedicated numerous hours to supporting
healthcare and cancer treatment in partnership
with the American Cancer Society, the
Karmanos Cancer Center, and the Henry Ford
Health System. We thank Cynthia Canty for
her commitment to journalistic excellence and
we congratulate her on her retirement. Her
dedicated leadership will be missed, but we
wish her good health and every happiness in
her retirement years.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring Cynthia Canty for her exper-
tise in the realm of TV and radio journalism.
Her work discussing art, culture, politics, and
lifestyle has had a profound impact on the
people of Michigan.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTH-
DAY OF ANGELO BORDONARO
HON. JOHN KATKO
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 2, 2019
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
celebration of Angelo Bordonaro’s 100th birth-
day. A lifelong resident of Central New York,
Mr. Bordonaro has lived an incredible life—he
started working at the age of 10, served in
World War II, and dedicated 60 years to the
Taunton Volunteer Fire Department.
Angelo Bordonaro was born in Syracuse to
a family of five children. When he was five
years old, his father passed away in a car ac-
cident, leaving his mother to care for the rest
of the family. Mr. Bordonaro and his family
moved to St. Louis, Missouri shortly after his
father’s death to find work. During this time,
he began working as a shoe-shine boy at 10
years old to help pay his family’s bills. The
family later returned to Syracuse after the
Great Depression and, along with his three
brothers, Mr. Bordonaro went to work in the
local factories.
When the United States joined World War II
in 1941, Mr. Bordonaro and his brothers joined
the Army. He served in Europe and reached
the rank of sergeant—a distinction he would
give up in 1944 in order to re-deploy to the
Pacific Theatre. During the battle at Fortress
Corregidor in 1945, Mr. Bordonaro exhibited
remarkable feats of fearlessness and commit-
ment to his duties. After surviving behind
enemy lines alone for three days—while suf-
fering from malaria and shrapnel wounds—he
finally reunited with his unit and refused to be
taken off the front lines for treatment.
Following his military service, Mr. Bordonaro
returned to Syracuse and settled in the town
of Camillus with his wife, Josephine. Mr.
Bordonaro worked as a high-skilled mason
and was employed by Prestolite Co. for 35

years. He later held a position at Solvay Proc-
ess for 11 years. He built a home in Camillus
where he and his wife raised four daughters.
To this day, Mr. Bordonaro still lives in the
home he built.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring the remarkable life of Angelo
Bordonaro. As a member of America’s great-
est generation, Mr. Bordonaro has bravely de-
fended our nation and helped shape the coun-
try we live in today. He is a cherished member
of the Central New York community and I wish
him all the best on his 100th birthday.

IN RECOGNITION OF CPL. JOSE
LUIS ‘‘SPEEDY’’ ESPERICUETA
HON. HENRY CUELLAR
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 2, 2019
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the life and service of Cpl. Jose
Luis ‘‘Speedy’’ Espericueta.
Cpl. Espericueta was an 18-year law en-
forcement veteran, most of which was spent
with the City of Mission Police Department. He
began his career with the San Benito Police
Department where he received several acco-
lades including, Police Officer of the Year. He
then joined the Mission Police Department as
a patrol officer before he was promoted to pa-
trol corporal.
During his career, he was noted for saving
two young children who were trapped in a car
and for apprehending multiple armed suspects
during a home invasion. He also received a
Meritorious Service Award after he saved an
elderly individual from a burning house. In ad-
dition, he was featured on A&E’s Live PD and
National Geographic’s Border Wars.
Cpl. Espericueta is survived by his high
school sweetheart and wife of 21 years, Ro-
berta ‘‘Bobbie’’ De Leon Espericueta, and their
two children, Brianna and Joaquin.
It is important to remember that law enforce-
ment officials risk their lives every day for our
safety. Cpl. Espericueta’s heroic life and ca-
reer embodies the integrity and servitude of a
truly influential community leader and law en-
forcement official. I am grateful for the oppor-
tunity to honor the life of this remarkable and
exemplary officer. His legacy will live on
through the lives of the many people he
helped to protect.
Madam Speaker, I again, recognize Cpl.
Espericueta and his heroic service to his com-
munity.

COMMENTS ON YOHO AMENDMENT
25 TO H.R. 3055
HON. TED S. YOHO
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 2, 2019
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, last week I
had amendment number 25 accepted as part
of the Commerce Justice Science appropria-
tions package. This amendment increased and
decreased the NASA science and research
fund by $1,000,000 in order to highlight the
importance of funding research to better un-
derstand human development in space in
order to promote future space colonies. How-
ever, I would like to clarify that while I think
these embryology experiments are of the ut-
most importance, I do not believe they should
be done using human embryos or babies. The
intent of this amendment was strictly to high-
light the importance of non-human embryology
experiments.

IN RECOGNITION OF DEPUTY
CHIEF DEAN L. MELANSON
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 2, 2019
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in recognition of the retirement of Deputy
Chief Dean L. Melanson, after over three dec-
ades of service with the Hyannis Fire Depart-
ment.
Deputy Chief Melanson’s 44 years in the
line of duty began in 1975 at the Acton Fire’s
Auxiliary Department. Later, he joined the
Hyannis Fire Department in 1985 as a Fire
Prevention Officer and quickly came to as-
sume positions of leadership.
Deputy Chief Melanson is widely recognized
as an expert on fire prevention, and over the
course of his career, Hyannis transitioned from
a small vacation community to a much larger,
more urbanized municipality. It was with his
knowledge and expertise that greater public
work projects were undertaken and completed
to accommodate the town’s growing popu-
lation.
Further, as an instructor at the Massachu-
setts Fire Academy, Barnstable County Fire
Academy and in the Fire Sciences Division at
Cape Cod Community College, Deputy Chief
Melanson helped to shape the training and
readiness of the next generation of public
servants.
Deputy Chief Melanson has dedicated his
life to serving his community, and I wish him
many years of well-deserved happiness and
more with his family in retirement.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Dean
L. Melanson, Deputy Chief of the Hyannis Fire
Department, and I ask that my colleagues join
me in recognizing his years of dedication to
his community.

HONORING ANDRES PONCE
‘‘ANDY’’ RUIZ, JR.
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 2, 2019
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor Mr. Andres Ponce ‘‘Andy’’
Ruiz, Jr., the first Mexican-American boxer to
win the heavyweight title.
Andy Ruiz, Jr. was born and raised in Impe-
rial, California, a city roughly 18 miles from the
U.S.-Mexico border. Andy began boxing at the
age of six with the support of his father, An-
dres Ruiz, Sr. Despite his skill and resilience,
Andy was often judged based on his appear-
ance. He did not let this deter him and quickly
became an early standout, achieving a re-
markable amateur boxing record of 105–5.
Andy started his professional career at 19
years of age on March 28, 2009, at the Plaza
de Toros in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico.
Andy had his first opportunity to become the
world boxing heavyweight champion in 2016,
against Joseph Parker. Unfortunately, he lost
the fight by decision, but the loss only
furthered his ambitions to continue striving in
the world of boxing. On June 1, 2019, Andy
learned he could compete for the world heavy-
weight champion for a second time.
Andy stunned the world by upsetting the
previously undefeated heavyweight champion
of the world, Anthony Joshua, by technical
knockout (TKO) after seven rounds at Madi-
son Square Garden in New York City, New
York. This victory made history, declaring
Andy to be the first heavyweight champion of
Mexican descent and winning the WBA, IBF,
WBO, IBO heavyweight titles. As of June 6,
2019, Andy Ruiz, Jr., has won a staggering 33
fights with only one loss.
Madam Speaker, Mr. Andy Ruiz, Jr. has
worked tirelessly to prove that with hard work,
determination, and dedication, we can accom-
plish anything we set ourselves to do. He has
reminded the world that one should not judge
a person by their appearance nor judge a
book by its cover. It is an honor to recognize
a dedicated, ambitious individual who has
greatly impacted the world of boxing. Andy
has made history, giving young people across
our country the hope to achieve anything they
set their mind to and for that I stand here
today to recognize him.
f
HONORING THE LIFE OF NICKI
SANCHEZ MEYER
HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 2, 2019
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor the extraordinary life of
Nicki Sanchez Meyer, who went to be with the
Lord on June 13, 2019.
Although Nicki had only called the City of
Hartwell home for eight years, she was a pillar
in the Hart County community. As Director of
the Chamber of Commerce, Nicki spent five
years working tirelessly to promote the busi-
nesses and amenities that make Hart County
so attractive. Even after retiring from her posi-
tion as director, Nicki continued to serve her
community by working as an economic devel-
opment specialist for the chamber.
Nicki’s attitude of service impacted her com-
munity well beyond her economic develop-
ment work. She devoted her time to volun-
teering with countless groups, including the
Hartwell Service League, Hart Habitat,
Hartwell Downtown Development Authority,
Northeast Georgia Council for Domestic Vio-
lence, and Have a Hope Ministries, just to
name a few.
What those around her recall the most was
Nicki’s love and passion for her community
and improving it for future generations. She
leaves behind a remarkable legacy of service,
and her passing is felt deeply by the people of
Hartwell, in addition to her beloved family and
friends. On behalf of the Ninth District of Geor-

CELEBRATING THE 10TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF SAY YES SYRACUSE
HON. JOHN KATKO
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 2, 2019
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Syracuse
Chapter of Say Yes to Education. Throughout
its history in Central New York, Say Yes Syra-
cuse has mentored thousands of public-school
students and helped them successfully grad-
uate high school. Additionally, Say Yes Syra-
cuse financially supports select students after
their high school graduation as they pursue
postsecondary education.
Say Yes Syracuse offers a variety of serv-
ices to aspiring Central New York students.
These services include summer education pro-
grams, SAT study classes, and pre-college
preparation seminars. As a result of Say Yes
Syracuse’s efforts, 9th-grade dropout rates
have declined and over 4,000 Say Yes Syra-
cuse students have enrolled in two- or four-
year colleges.
In order to fulfill its commitment to local stu-
dents, Say Yes Syracuse has developed
strong relationships with many Central New
York institutions and leaders. Syracuse Uni-
versity, Onondaga County Community Col-
lege, the Syracuse City School District, the
City of Syracuse, and Onondaga County all
contribute to Say Yes Syracuse’s goal of help-
ing all Syracuse-area students reach their full
academic potential. These public-private part-
nerships strengthen the Central New York’s
community.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the
House to join me in celebrating Say Yes
Syracuse’s 10th anniversary. Since opening its
Syracuse chapter, Say Yes to Education has
positively impacted the Central New York
community and provided new education op-
portunities to underserved students. Under the
leadership of Ahmeed Turner, I am confident
Say Yes Syracuse will continue to thrive in
Central New York.

RECOGNIZING THE 10TH WORLD
TAMIL CONFERENCE
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 2, 2019
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker,
today I rise to recognize the International As-
sociation of Tamil Research, the Federation of
Tamil Sangams of North America, and the
Chicago Tamil Sangam on the occasion of the
10th World Tamil Conference, commencing on
July 4, 2019 in Schaumburg, Illinois.
Since the first World Tamil Conference in
1966, various cities around the world have
hosted this important gathering of scholars
and the Tamil community. The oldest sangam
in the United States, Chicago Tamil Sangam
is honored to observe its Golden Jubilee 50th
Anniversary in concert with the four-day World
Tamil Conference, its important scholarly pres-
entations on Tamil language and history, and
its celebration of the rich heritage of Tamil cul-
ture and art.
This year’s research conference theme is
‘‘New Historicist, Scientific and Comparative
Study of the Antiquity of the Tamils, Tamil
Language, Literature, Culture and Civilization.’’
In addition to this scholarly focus, the World
Tamil Conference will feature a host of cultural
programs, the International Conference Sem-
inar on Tamil Studies, a Global Tamil Entre-
preneurs meeting, and a festive parade and
banquet. Above all, the conference is a cele-
bration of the vibrant Tamil community and
preserves and shares the rich history and cul-
ture of Tamil people worldwide.
The 2019 World Tamil Conference also will
recognize the passing of the late Dr. V.C.
Kulandaiswamy, former Vice Chancellor of
Anna University and Vice Chairman of the
International Association of Tamil Research. In
addition to his outstanding contributions to the
science of hydrology, Dr. Kulandaiswamy was
instrumental in bringing the International Asso-
ciation of Tamil Research conference to the
United States, and was honored for his con-
tributions to science, engineering and edu-
cation by the nation of India with the pres-
tigious national Padma Shri and Padma
Bhushan awards.
Madam Speaker, I would like to recognize
the World Tamil Conference and the Chicago
Tamil Sangam, International Association of
Tamil Research, and Federation of Tamil
Sangams of North America for their tireless ef-
forts to bring together proud Tamils from
around the world, for their commitment to pre-
serving one of the world’s oldest languages
and civilizations, and for their many years of
service to the Tamil diaspora in the United
States.

IN HONOR OF MRS. NANCY
DOOLEY
HON. DOUG LAMBORN
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 2, 2019
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life of Mrs. Nancy Dooley,
cherished wife, sister, mother, grandmother,
niece, aunt, and friend. Nancy was a longtime
resident of Colorado Springs and passed
away on Monday, April 29, 2019.
Nancy was born in 1942 in Berlin, Wis-
consin. Her father was an officer in the army,
and throughout her childhood, she moved with
her family all over the United States and to
Japan, Turkey, Germany, and Korea.
Nancy loved school and became a member
of the National Honor Society when she grad-
uated from Washington & Lee High School in
Arlington, Virginia, in 1960. She had a warm,
vibrant, and kind personality, and built numer-
ous friendships throughout her life.
In 1962, Nancy married U.S. Army Captain
Richard T. Lynch. She was expecting their
second child when her husband was killed in
action in Vietnam in September 1964. The
loss was devastating, but with characteristic
determination, she raised her children alone
for the next several years. Nancy remarried
U.S. Army Captain Thomas F. Dooley in 1968,
a West Point graduate, who would later retire
as a Lt. Colonel.
Nancy loved to travel and particularly en-
joyed visiting France where she frequented
Paris, The Paris Air Show, Southern France,
Monte Carlo and most notably Omaha Beach,
the site of the Normandy Invasion.
After she and her family moved to Colorado
Springs, Nancy sold real estate, excelling at
building relationships with her clients and dif-
ferent brokers. She was active in many mili-
tary clubs, such as the Officer Spouse’s Club.
Nancy served for over fifteen years as an offi-
cer of the Cheyenne Mountain Republican
Forum of El Paso County, Colorado, where
she was known for her faithful spirit and diet-
breaking cheesecake. One of Nancy’s great
loves and talents was cooking. She was also
a devoted volunteer and leader in many local
conservative groups and the Catholic church.
Nancy is survived by her husband (of fifty-
one years) Tom, daughter Julie (John)
Kummer, son Richard Lynch, II, brother Bill
(Kathy) Blakefield, granddaughter Annelise
Kummer, and several nieces, nephews, cous-
ins, and friends. Nancy will live forever in the
hearts of those who knew and loved her.
