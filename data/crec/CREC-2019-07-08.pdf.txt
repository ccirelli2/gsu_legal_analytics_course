PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Eternal God, accept our thanks and
praise for Your goodness. Thank You
for challenging work and for the satis-
faction of a job well done.
Lord, we are grateful also for dis-
appointments and failures that teach
us to depend on You.
Continue to bless our Senators. Give
them Your spirit that they may make
You known in thoughts, words, and ac-
tions. Remind them to strive to glorify
You in deeds both large and small.
Keep them from stumbling or slipping
so one day they will stand before You
with great joy.
We pray in Your merciful Name.
Amen.

Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

CONSTITUENT OUTREACH
Mr. GRASSLEY. If you are going to
have representative government, you
have to have dialogue between con-
stituents and those of us elected.
Last week, I continued my annual 99
county meetings with Q&A’s in 12 of
our 99 counties.
No matter the setting, Iowans set the
agenda at my meetings. Holding face-
to-face meetings is the best way to
hear what is on Iowans’ minds, but it is
not the only way.
I encourage Iowans to write in or call
my office to voice their opinions on
any Federal issue. Iowans can also read
my speeches and press releases on
grassley.senate.gov; follow me on
Facebook or on Twitter
@chuckgrassley or
@senatorchuckgrassley on Instagram.
I enjoyed my conversations with
Iowans last week.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
I ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms.
ERNST). Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

FOURTH OF JULY
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
I hope all of our colleagues had a pro-
ductive State work period and an en-
joyable Fourth of July.
On Thursday, hundreds of millions of
proud Americans joined together all
across our country in town squares,
parks, and backyards to cohost our Na-
tion’s 243rd birthday party. As always,
the parades and fireworks and picnics
commemorated something serious: our
proud national legacy of liberty. It
began in Philadelphia in 1776, and we
continue working to make it manifest
to this day.
Celebrating our freedoms also means
remembering the great sacrifices that
so many have given in order to protect
and preserve them. It is fitting that
here in our Nation’s Capital, the fire-
works display lights up our war memo-
rials and the tombs of fallen warriors
across the river. And, of course, we re-
member also all the men and women
currently serving today.
We Americans have so much to be
proud of. Just yesterday, we were given
yet another reason. Instead of taking
the weekend off, the U.S. women’s na-
tional soccer team finished their time
in France by winning the World Cup.
Earlier last week, the U.S. women com-
memorated Independence Day early by
beating England, and then yesterday,
they defeated the Netherlands—two to
nothing—to take first place. Through
grit, teamwork, and dazzling talent,
the American women have now raised
the World Cup trophy four times.
A billion viewers around the world
tuned in to watch the tournament. All
told, they saw the United States
outscore our opponents collectively by
26 to 3 and follow our victory in the

fering the Senate’s congratulations to
the U.S. women’s national soccer team
for bringing this honor home.
f
NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on another matter, this week, the Sen-
ate will continue to make headway and
confirm the President’s highly quali-
fied nominees for important Federal of-
fices.
We will begin by considering Daniel
Bress, who has been nominated to serve
on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit. Mr. Bress is a graduate
of Harvard College and the University
of Virginia School of Law. Clerkships
after law school included time at the
Supreme Court clerking for the late
Justice Scalia. Since then, he has built
an impressive reputation in private
practice.
I look forward to continuing the
work of our colleagues on the Judici-
ary Committee, who favorably rec-
ommended Mr. Bress to the floor, when
we vote to advance his nomination
later today and vote on his confirma-
tion later this week.
After him, the Senate will weigh
three nominees for district court va-
cancies in Florida, Indiana, and Penn-
sylvania. After them, we will continue
to staff up the executive branch with
nominees for important posts in the
Department of Education, the Depart-
ment of Labor, and the EPA.
As I have said continually, I am
sorry that it is necessary to file cloture
on uncontroversial district court and
Assistant Secretary nominees, but not-
withstanding that hurdle, I am pleased
that the Senate’s modest rules change
from several months back is proving
successful and will enable us to get
through this whole list of impressive
professionals this very week. I look for-
ward to getting these amply-qualified
nominees on the job so they can go to
work for the country and the American
people can be governed by the govern-
ment they elected.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
f
U.S. WOMEN’S WORLD CUP
VICTORY
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, let
me congratulate the U.S. Women’s Na-
tional Team on winning the World Cup
yesterday. It is the second title in a
row and fourth overall, the most for
any nation. Boy, did they make us
proud.
The team’s sustained level of excel-
lence is something for all of us to exult
in, to be proud of, as are the heart,
skill, and sheer joy the U.S. women
bring to the pitch. As they make their
way home, I send them my congratula-
tions, my thanks, and a formal invita-
tion for the team to come to the Upper
Chamber for a celebration as they visit
our Nation’s Capital. It would be my
honor to host America’s winning team.
I want to send a special congratula-
tions to the New Yorkers on the team,
Allie Long and Crystal Dunn, the lat-
ter of whom made a crucial tackle in
the final, leading to our second and de-
cisive goal in the final period. New
York is proud of them both, as well as
the entire roster.
While today we celebrate their vic-
tory, we also recognize that these
women athletes have challenges and
they make us really think about the
future of women’s sports. They make
us grapple with the deep unfairness in
how female athletes are treated and
paid compared to their male counter-
parts. Similarly, it is an unfortunate
reality that women in the workforce
see their male colleagues paid signifi-
cantly more for the same work.
We have come a long way in terms of
the prominence of and support for
women’s sports over the past decade,
but we have not come nearly far
enough. Every young girl who has had
to play on weeknights instead of week-
ends because that is when the boys
play, who has had to accept older
equipment because the boys got the
new stuff, who has had to play on the
other field or rink or court because the
boys were using the main one—every
girl who has gone through that knows
this to be true. As a parent of two girls
who played soccer, basketball, base-
ball, and lacrosse, I know this to be
true.
I think when it comes to U.S. women,
it is absolutely right to be talking
about their pay right now. They have
shone a light on the fact that, in our
society, women are simply not treated
fairly because of their gender. Some-
thing needs to change here. What the
U.S. women did was extraordinary, and
they deserve to be compensated fairly.
All women need to be compensated
fairly, period. We ought to pay atten-
tion to this not just once every 4 years
during the World Cup, but year in and
year out.
How about the equal payment
amendment that the House has passed?
Why don’t we put it on the floor of the
Senate in honor of the women who won
the World Cup? Why don’t we do that,
Leader MCCONNELL?
I am sure there will be lots of
encomia from the other side about
these women. Let’s act so we can help
all women achieve equality—equal
work, equal pay.
f
HEALTHCARE
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
now on healthcare, tomorrow the Fifth
Circuit will hear oral arguments in the
case of Texas v. United States. The fate
of our entire healthcare system hangs
in the balance. This challenge to the
Affordable Care Act, brought by Repub-
lican State attorneys general and re-
grettably supported by President
Trump and his administration, rep-
resents the latest efforts by Repub-
licans to dismantle healthcare as we
know it in America.
After failing to repeal our healthcare
through Federal legislation, Repub-
licans have now turned to the courts. If
Republicans get their way in this case,
the impact on Americans would be cat-
astrophic; that is not an exaggera-
tion—catastrophic. It would result in
the elimination of protections for peo-
ple with preexisting conditions, pos-
sibly increasing costs for 133 million
Americans under 65.
If you have a son or daughter with
cancer and the insurance company cuts
you off, that is catastrophic, nothing
less. How many people will go through
that if our Republican friends have
their way? It would result in sky-
rocketing prescription drug costs for
seniors or Medicare. Let’s say there is
a lifesaving drug, but it is too expen-
sive, and you can’t afford it, that is
catastrophic to most Americans.
Millions of people would be kicked
off Medicaid, leaving the most vulner-
able out to fend for themselves. Again,
you desperately need care, but no one
will give it to you. That is cata-
strophic.
Bring it all together, and what our
Republican friends want to do is make
Americans pay higher prices for infe-
rior care. That is cruelty on a massive
scale.
Of course, we have been here before.
For nearly 2 years, the administration
pushed Congress to repeal the ACA—a
crusade that failed on the Senate floor
multiple times. President Trump’s
budget calls for trillions in cuts to
Medicare and Medicaid. He has opened
up the floodgates for junk plans that
don’t cover the things that really
count, like cancer treatment, mater-
nity care, addiction services, and he
has deliberately worked to make it
harder for people to sign up for
healthcare.
On that court case, 47 Democrats
wished that we would join the lawsuit.
We asked Republicans to join us in
that. I think it was only one who was.
Where are our Republican friends?
They talk about wanting to preserve
preexisting conditions, but they are
mum when the administration they
support tries to repeal them. It is hy-
pocrisy—hypocrisy. If you believe in
supporting people’s protections for pre-
existing conditions, you oppose the
lawsuit and join us in saying that law-
suit should not be filed. Our Repub-
lican friends know where the people
are, but they are afraid. They are quiv-
ering that Donald Trump will be angry
with them if they oppose his lawsuit.
Shame on them.
Our Republican friends can never
argue that they are the party of
healthcare. When President Trump ar-
gues that Republicans are the party of

healthcare, God help the middle class.
They are the party of no healthcare;
the party of repeal with no plan to re-
place.
This lawsuit is just the latest salvo
against the American people, and it
shows that so long as Republicans are
in power, the healthcare of the Amer-
ican people will not be safe. If they are
successful in striking down the Afford-
able Care Act, Republicans—all of
them—will own the consequences.
f
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
last week, the DHS inspector general
released a report detailing horrid con-
ditions at border facilities. This is the
President’s own DHS inspector general
saying how bad conditions were. Then
we found reports of a secret Border Pa-
trol workers’ Facebook group that re-
vealed a toxic culture at U.S. Customs
and Border Protection. Everything we
had heard anecdotally, everything we
feared about the mindset of CBP
proved to be true in that Facebook
group.
Over the weekend, the New York
Times and then the El Paso Times re-
leased the latest account of conditions
at the Border Patrol station in Clint,
TX. A facility built for 100 adults has
become a modern-day internment camp
for up to 700 children at a time, many
locked up for weeks on end. Some chil-
dren go without beds to sleep on. There
are food shortages and insufficient
sanitation. For heaven’s sake, we read
reports of children suffering from out-
breaks of scabies, lice, and even chick-
en pox. This is cruelty—cruelty—once
again.
These awful conditions show that for
too long, the CBP has operated as an
agency out of control. It must be
reined in immediately, beginning with
its leadership. Internal investigations
will not suffice because CBP leader-
ship—particularly Acting Commis-
sioner Mark Morgan—is far too callous
in their treatment of children and their
families. Too many of the CBP leaders
have had this attitude for too long, and
it has infested itself down to too many
who are the rank and file in that agen-
cy. We need untainted professionals to
be brought in from outside the CBP
structure immediately.
President Trump turns to his typical
tactics of denial, distortion, and dis-
traction. President Trump should be
focused on fixing the problems that
exist instead of blaming others. The
truth, of course, is that we should
never have been in this situation in the
first place. The suffering imposed on
migrant children is the result of the
administration’s own mishandling of
family arrivals through Central Amer-
ica.
While Donald Trump says he is seri-
ous about fixing our immigration chal-
lenges, he has done just about every-
thing to make matters worse.
President Trump, you want to fix the
border? Then do what Democrats have
been asking you to do for a long time—
let the asylum seekers apply for asy-
lum in their home countries, increase
the number of judges to process the
cases, and, for heaven’s sake, restore
aid to those Central American coun-
tries of Honduras, El Salvador, and
Nicaragua to help them crack down on
gang violence and cartels so people will
not flee for fear of their lives from the
gangs.
President Trump, stop finger-point-
ing at Democrats for this mess of your
own making. You are the President. As
this problem festers and gets worse,
the American people realize you are
the Chief Executive. It is your problem
to solve.
We will join you, if you have any-
thing reasonable to propose, but just
finger-pointing at Democrats for this
mess of your own making, President
Trump, is like poking holes in your
own umbrella and then blaming the
clouds when you get wet.
I urge President Trump and Senate
Republicans to seriously consider these
measures because unless we make
structural reforms to our immigration
system, we have done nothing to re-
verse what is happening at the south-
ern border.
f
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
President Trump’s hypocrisy and his
diving into mistruths over and over
again reared its ugly head once again.
We can’t become used to it because it
is such a bad thing for a President to
be so abjectly dishonest about so much
of what is happening and so much of
what he does. It happened again.
Today, amazingly enough, President
Trump tried to claim credit as a leader
on environmental protection, of all
things. This is laughable. The same
President who pulled us out of the
Paris Agreement, who has filled his ad-
ministration with oil and coal cronies,
who has slashed protections for clean
air, clean water, and protections for
public lands, and who has denied basic
science now wants to call himself a
leader on the environment. Give me a
break.
Try as he might say otherwise, Presi-
dent Trump has proved himself prob-
ably the staunchest ally of the worst
polluters of any President we have ever
had.
On climate change, the President’s
record is particularly egregious. In 2
years, his government has gutted oil,
coal, and pollution standards, has
erased climate data from government
websites, and even censored words like
‘‘climate change’’ from appearing in of-
ficial government documents. This is
somebody who is a leader of environ-
mental protection? How gullible does
he think the American people are?
Even Trump supporters may agree with
him on this issue, but to say he is pro-
tecting the environment is ludicrous.
Some of these things are just the tip
of the iceberg. Would someone who is a
leader on environmental protection
hire oil and coal lobbyists to run the
EPA and Department of Interior and
cripple the National Climate Assess-
ment? He completely caves to the oil
and gas industry. Every time they say
jump, he says how high. Now he has the
temerity—the gall—to say he is the
leader of environmental protection.
Again, give me a break.
To be fair, President Trump’s speech
does have one silver lining. The mere
fact that he even spoke today on the
environment forces us to an unavoid-
able conclusion: Climate change is
real. It is a serious problem that de-
serves action, including action in this
Chamber.
The Republican majority, Leader
MCCONNELL, could take action on this
issue at a moment’s notice, but, for
now, they are happy keeping their
heads in the sand. They have not
brought a single measure to the floor
that would deal with the issue of cli-
mate, even as their views grow increas-
ingly out of step with most Americans.
They cannot continue to keep their
heads in the sand as our planet faces
serious problems today and even far
more serious problems for our children.
It is an issue that can’t wait a day
longer, and yet the masters of this leg-
islative graveyard refuse to act. I fear
the majority in this body will refuse to
act until either they are no longer the
majority or, even worse, it is too late.
I yield the floor.

YOUNGSTOWN VINDICATOR
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, at
the end of June, we received news that
sickened so many of us. The Youngs-
town Vindicator, one of Ohio’s greatest
local newspapers, is closing after 150
years in business.
It is devastating news for a commu-
nity that is already reeling from Gen-
eral Motors’ abandonment of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4686 July 8, 2019
Lordstown—and ‘‘abandonment’’ is the
right word. General Motors made the
decision to shut down production, los-
ing 4,500 jobs in Lordstown, OH. They
moved some of their production to
Mexico. They took part of their tax
cuts and their profits and used that
money to buy stock options for their
top executives.
The Vindicator was reporting the
story about GM’s abandonment of
Lordstown before the national media
came to town. When GM laid off one
shift of workers back in late 2016, after
the Presidential election, then a second
shift several months later, the Vindi-
cator was there covering what those
job losses meant to this community.
We know the end of the Vindicator’s
coverage is another huge blow to
Mahoning Valley.
Our hearts break for the dedicated
journalists and support staff losing
their jobs. This was a family-owned
paper for 132 years.
This will not just be a loss for those
who worked there. When local news-
papers close, everyone suffers. Local
reporters know their communities bet-
ter than anyone. David Skolnick, Mark
Sweetwood, and the entire Vindicator
team have held local officials account-
able. They told the stories of how na-
tional issues affect real Ohioans, how
our trade policy hurts Ohio workers,
and how the opioid crisis has dev-
astated the valley. Craig Graziosi and
many others have done vital work cov-
ering Lordstown. These journalists
care about the cities and towns they
serve. They hold those in power ac-
countable, whether it is local govern-
ment or city business leaders.
NPR reported on what happens when
local papers shut down. First of all, in-
vestigative reporting suffers. Long in-
vestigations are expensive. Usually,
when there are no local newspapers to
do these stories, no one steps in to fill
the void. The investigations don’t hap-
pen. Corruption increases, the city’s fi-
nancial health suffers, and citizens get
hurt.
Three researchers looked at local
newspaper closures over a 19-year pe-
riod. From 1996 to 2015, 300 papers
across the country closed in that time.
They found that where papers closed,
city borrowing costs went up. Without
local journalists, city watchdogs, the
city’s finances took a hit. It became
more costly for taxpayers to fund local
schools and other projects. It is just
more evidence that journalists are
vital to our communities and are nec-
essary for our democracy.
Too many people in this country al-
ready undermine the work that jour-
nalists do—or worse. We see reporters
restricted, vilified, and even threat-
ened—all for getting up every day and
doing their jobs honorably.
On the anniversary of the shooting at
the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, MD,
where several reporters were murdered
in cold blood, the President of the
United States joked about getting rid
of journalists. That is pretty sick. He
is the same President who says jour-
nalists are the enemy of the people.
Meanwhile, Wall Street hedge funds
gobble up local papers around the coun-
try. Just this spring, the Cincinnati
Enquirer and other papers around the
country that are owned by Gannett
fought off a hostile takeover by a New
York hedge fund. These guys—and they
are mostly guys in the hedge funds—
buy up local newspapers and turn
around and dismantle them. They fire
reporters, and they sell company as-
sets. That is their business model—to
put tens of millions of dollars in their
pockets. There is no public benefit to
that; there are only benefits to the
hedge fund operators. It is the last
thing we need as the news business gets
tougher and tougher.
We have lost veteran reporters at
Cleveland.com and at the Columbus
Dispatch. The Dispatch’s parent com-
pany, GateHouse Media, laid off more
than 100 journalists this spring, includ-
ing its longtime Washington bureau
chief, Jack Torry, and now The Vindi-
cator is closing its doors for good.
It is time for us in the White House
and in this Congress to stand up for the
free press, to stand up for community
newspapers, and to stand up for local
journalists, who are vital to the fabric
of cities and towns like Youngstown
and all across this country.
NOMINATION OF PETER C. WRIGHT
Madam President, Ohioans in the
Miami Valley are living with the pres-
ence of toxic chemicals known as
PFAS that are contaminating their
drinking water, and the people have
been forced to pay for water treatment
costs without their getting the help
they need.
PFAS chemicals are contaminating
water supplies all over the country. It
is why Senators on both sides of the
aisle have called on the EPA to offi-
cially designate PFAS chemicals as the
hazardous substances they are so that
communities like Dayton can access
the Federal funds they need for cleanup
and can hold polluters accountable.
The administration, similar to what
the Democratic leader just said, has
dragged its feet. Peter Wright has been
at the EPA for a year, and under his
leadership, the Agency has released a
PFAS Action Plan that, frankly, in-
cludes very little action. Now the
Agency expects the Senate to reward
this action by confirming him to over-
see the EPA’s Superfund Program.
We know the influence of oil and gas.
We know the influence of polluters in
this administration. We know they
pulled out of the Paris accord, which
almost every major country in the
world agreed to. We know this adminis-
tration has tried to compromise on
mileage standards. There is an over-
whelming agreement in this country
that the government should not be on
the side of the polluters and oil indus-
tries but should be on the side of public
health. Someone who has repeatedly
failed to hold polluters accountable for
the damage they have done to the
drinking water in Dayton and across
the country has no business serving in
a leadership role within the EPA. I will
say it again. Someone who has repeat-
edly failed to hold polluters account-
able for the damage they have done to
drinking water in Dayton and across
the country has no business serving as
a leader within the EPA.
It is not a partisan issue. This year,
I joined a bipartisan group of col-
leagues in introducing legislation to
require the Environmental Protection
Agency to step up and declare those
chemicals as hazardous substances.
Last year, I demanded the government
release its Federal study of PFAS
chemicals and how safe or unsafe they
really are. The residents of Dayton and
the residents of other communities
shouldn’t have to worry about the safe-
ty of their water supplies. Ohioans de-
serve answers from the Environmental
Protection Agency. The government is
there to protect them.
I thank my colleague Senator CAR-
PER for his leadership on this issue.
I urge my colleagues to oppose Peter
Wright’s nomination—another Trump
administration official who fronts and
shills for the oil industry, for the pol-
luters, and for people who shouldn’t
have roles in government. We should
demand a nominee who will take this
job seriously when it comes to pro-
tecting the water supply in Dayton,
OH, and across this country.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.

unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.

REMEMBERING HOWELL HEFLIN AND GILES
PERKINS
Mr. JONES. Madam President, I rise
to honor two of Alabama’s great citi-
zens. The State misses greatly the late
Senator Howell Heflin, who was a
Member of this body for 18 years, and
my friend and campaign manager,
Giles Perkins, who was a lawyer in Bir-
mingham, AL. These two men spent
their lives working to improve our
great State, and both shaped the future
of Alabama in his own way. Following
these remarks, we are going to be hon-
oring both of these men in a reception
to be held in my office.
I last spoke on the floor of my friend
and former campaign manager, Giles
Perkins, following his death last De-
cember. Giles was an accomplished at-
torney, community leader, brilliant po-
litical adviser, and strategist. Al-
though a native of Texas, he moved to
Alabama following his marriage to his
true love, Hillery Head, and he quickly
came to understand how Alabama’s
complicated and sometimes dark his-
tory shaped our State. He had the vi-
sion of a brighter future if all Alabam-
ians could have just simply worked to-
gether to create one Alabama for ev-
eryone.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4687
July 8, 2019
Whether in politics, his legal prac-
tice, or with regard to his remarkable
community projects—most notably
Railroad Park, which helped to trans-
form the city of Birmingham—for any-
one who crossed paths with Giles, one
saw in him his passion for making Ala-
bama and the entire South better
places for us all.
Giles’ last political effort was my
2017 Senate campaign. As campaign
chair, he was nothing short of extraor-
dinary. He challenged me constantly—
so much so that I began calling him
Yoda. I still often refer to him as Yoda.
His ability to see the bigger picture
and his ‘‘tough love’’ approach with me
made me a much better candidate, a
better person, and certainly a better
U.S. Senator. I will always cherish his
friendship.
Howell Heflin was, to say the least, a
lion of the U.S. Senate and a political
mentor of mine. A military hero who
hailed from Tuscumbia, AL, Judge
Howell Heflin was sometimes described
as the ‘‘conscience of the Senate’’ as he
was widely known for his unshakable
integrity. Because of that, he was the
chair of the Ethics Committee, I think,
for 12 years running—something that,
in his final remarks, he described as
anything but enjoyable, but he was a
man of unshakable integrity. He was
part of the ‘‘greatest generation.’’ He
became a marine at the age of 21, and
he served the Nation during World War
II. He was awarded the Silver Star for
valor in combat, and he received two
Purple Hearts for his actions.
Even by Members of this body, How-
ell Heflin was always affectionately re-
ferred to as ‘‘Judge.’’ If you read back
over the day he announced his retire-
ment, which was on March 29, 1995, all
of his colleagues referred to him as
‘‘Judge’’ because of his extraordinary
career. As a one-term chief justice of
the Alabama Supreme Court, he mod-
ernized Alabama’s court system and
won numerous awards for it as well as
for himself personally. He was a known
national figure because of his work on
the courts. Later, while in this body,
he helped to streamline the Federal
courts in order to help move the civil
courts and the criminal justice system.
He always believed that justice delayed
was justice denied.
He was elected to the Senate in 1978.
I was then in my third year of law
school. During the summer of 1978, I
opted to work full time on his cam-
paign rather than to clerk for a law
firm. This was in part because I be-
lieved that his election, following a 20-
year or more domination of Alabama
politics by George Wallace, would be
one of the most significant elections in
Alabama’s history—a turning point for
a State whose reputation had sorely
suffered throughout the civil rights
movement. It turned out I was abso-
lutely right. Howell Heflin’s election
ushered in a time in Alabama during
which politicians in our State began to
look beyond the dog whistle politics of
race and to do their best to represent
all of the citizens of Alabama.
He was a champion of the rural farm-
er, NASA, and businesses throughout
Alabama. He was also a champion of
the small business leader, teachers,
members of the union, and African-
American citizens in Alabama, who
were still feeling the effects of dis-
crimination and restricted voting
rights.
By today’s standards, Howell Heflin
would certainly be considered pretty
conservative with his positions that
many, including myself, would prob-
ably not agree with. Yet, in his heart,
Howell Heflin believed in the Constitu-
tion of the United States, and he
strived to ensure that we lived up to
the creed that all people are created
equal. During his floor speech in which
he announced his retirement, he said,
‘‘Not until we become genuinely one
nation under God, indivisible, with lib-
erty and justice for all can this coun-
try realize its potential for true great-
ness.’’
He worked as a Senator to secure the
extension of the Voting Rights Act,
which is something we are still arguing
about today—23 years after he left the
Senate. He appointed the first two Af-
rican Americans to the Federal bench
in Alabama. Sadly, even though the
number of Federal judges in Alabama’s
three Federal districts have grown sig-
nificantly in number, there are still
only two active Federal judges in Ala-
bama who are African American. He
supported historically black colleges
and universities, and he ensured the
passage of the civil rights restoration
bill. He helped to pass the fair housing
bill and helped to establish a national
holiday that honors the late Martin
Luther King, Jr.
Howell Heflin’s commitment to ra-
cial justice and his sensitivity to issues
of race led him in 1993 to give a re-
markable floor speech that opposed an
insignia patent bill that contained an
image of a Confederate battle flag.
This was over 20 years before the trag-
edy in Charleston, SC, when battle
flags across the country came down. It
was 20 years or so before that when he
opposed an amendment that would
have contained an image of the Confed-
erate battle flag. It was truly a re-
markable speech, and I referenced it
just recently in a speech I gave here on
the Equality Act. It was considered by
many—his friends, his family, his staff,
and all who knew him, especially those
in this body—to be his finest hour. It
was his finest hour because it was one
of those rare occasions on the floor of
the Senate during which an impas-
sioned speech by one Senator swayed a
vote.
There was an amendment and a mo-
tion to table on that bill—a motion
that had not succeeded. Howell Heflin
then took to the floor so as to sway
Senators to reconsider. Then, over-
whelmingly, by a vote of over 75 to 20-
something, the motion was tabled, and
the bill died, as it should have.
That led Carol Moseley-Braun—the
first African-American female Senator
in history—to state the following:
His integrity, his intelligence, his commit-
ment and faith in the Constitution of these
United States, faith in what the American
dream has always stood for and can be in the
future, has led Judge Heflin in a direction
that I think is without peer and without par-
allel in this body. He has been a force for
good. He has been a force for right.
There are very few people who have
known Howell Heflin and there are
very few people in Alabama who re-
member him who would say otherwise.
He was a force for good, and he was a
force for right.
I am so proud that my first job after
law school was working with him as
staff counsel on the Senate Judiciary
Committee. It was just an amazing ex-
perience for a kid who had never been
to Washington, DC, before taking the
job.
It is now my privilege to hold the
seat that Judge Heflin had for 18 years.
It is my honor. The fact that I walked
off this floor with him as a staffer in
1980 and walked back on in 2018 in his
seat has been one of the greatest hon-
ors of my life.
In gratitude for that opportunity the
Judge gave me, I have established a fel-
lowship in my office for a recent law
school graduate—just like me in 1979—
and I look forward to welcoming the
first Howell Heflin fellow to my team
later this month.
Howell Heflin was sworn into the
Senate in 1979, 40 years ago this past
January. And it was about 40 years ago
this time of year that I joined his
staff—fresh out of law school, fresh off
of taking the bar exam. He was cer-
tainly my mentor and role model in
many ways, and each day that I am in
the Senate, I strive to continue his leg-
acy—not that I always vote as Howell
Heflin would, although, frankly, know-
ing him as I did, I am absolutely con-
vinced that he would have moderated
many of his positions with changing
times. He was that kind of leader. But
I am certainly guided by the principles
of public service to his constituents
that he described in his retirement an-
nouncement, in which he said:
I have endeavored to represent Alabama in
a studied, impartial, and fair-minded man-
ner. My record certainly indicates at least
an independent streak. I hope Alabamians
know that my decisions were based on what
I thought was in the best interest of my
State and Nation. While some may argue or
disagree with my decisions, I was convinced
that I was right. And I believe most Alabam-
ians felt that nothing more could be ex-
pected of me.
I agree with him 100 percent.
Ironically, Judge Heflin passed away
10 years to the day from the day he
gave that speech on March 29. I miss
him. Alabama misses him. And I can
assure my colleagues who didn’t know
him, the U.S. Senate misses him as
well.
The threads that tie Judge Heflin and
Giles Perkins together in history are
their deeply rooted integrity and their
dedication to leaving the State of Ala-
bama better than they found it. Their
memories inspire me every day.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4688 July 8, 2019
Today, following these remarks, I am
dedicating the conference rooms in my
Senate office to these two men who,
through leadership and commitment,
made a positive difference in the his-
tory of the State of Alabama, as well
as in my life.
I am so happy that I am going to be
joined by Judge Heflin’s son Tom and
his wife Cornelia, as well as numerous
former Heflin staffers, including his
longtime chief of staff, Mike House,
who is the one who made that fateful
call to me that summer as I was study-
ing for the bar exam to offer me the job
here on the Hill.
Also with us will be Drew Perkins
and his wife Nelly. Drew is the brother
of Giles. They will be here with us as
we celebrate both Judge Heflin and
Giles Perkins.
I would be remiss if I didn’t also men-
tion that in the corner of the Giles Per-
kins Conference Room will be the large
Yoda doll that will be kept in his
honor.
As for me, I will strive to continue
the work that they began, to fulfill
their vision, and to honor their memo-
ries as long as I have the privilege of
serving here in the U.S. Senate.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas.
VETERAN SUICIDE PREVENTION EFFORTS
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, re-
cently I met with members of the
American Legion of Arkansas during
their annual convention. This year
they celebrated 100 years of helping
veterans. I was honored to join them
on this occasion and share how proud
we are of their efforts to serve their
fellow veterans.
Since its founding, Legionnaires have
been leading advocates for veterans
and their families. They are committed
to strengthening the policies, pro-
grams, and institutions to support
those who have worn our Nation’s uni-
form.
One of the ways they have been in-
strumental in achieving this is bring-
ing Legionnaires from across the coun-
try to Washington to share the Le-
gion’s priorities with me and my col-
leagues. Members from Arkansas ex-
pressed that one of the top issues for
the Legion this Congress, as has been
the case for the past several years, is
suicide prevention.
The American Legion and other
VSOs like the VFW, AMVETS, IAVA,
Wounded Warrior Project—and the list
simply goes on and on—are pressing for
action to improve access and treat-
ment for veterans who are at risk of
suicide. We all know there is room for
improvement on this front.
Congress has provided significant
funding increases to the Department of
Veterans Affairs to decrease veteran
suicide rates. In fiscal year 2010, the
VA requested $62 million for suicide
prevention outreach. That number
nearly quadrupled to $222 million with-
in 10 years. Despite the sharp increase
in resources, sadly, 20 veterans commit
suicide each day. That number has, un-
fortunately, remained roughly un-
changed throughout the years.
Tellingly and sadly, only 6 of those 20
veterans are receiving healthcare serv-
ices at the VA.
Veterans are particularly vulnerable
to mental health struggles which, when
untreated, can lead to increased risk of
suicide. They suffer a disproportion-
ately higher rate of suicide compared
to the general population.
In Arkansas, veterans represent
about 8 percent of the population, but,
sadly, they account for one-fifth of the
suicides in my State. So you have 8
percent of the population yet 20 per-
cent of the suicides.
I have heard the anguish of family
members and friends who miss the
signs of mental health struggles in
their loved ones. We have read and
heard in the news about veterans who
have taken their own lives on VA prop-
erties. They were so close to help yet
felt that their situations were beyond
repair. We need to close the loop to en-
sure that individuals at risk make con-
tact with professionals trained to re-
spond to address the needs of these vul-
nerable veterans.
Congress is actively engaged in fight-
ing this public health crisis. In 2015, we
passed and the President signed into
law the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention
for American Veterans Act. This was
an important step to providing the VA
with the tools and flexibility to get
help for veterans living with mental
illness. We knew this was just the
start.
My colleagues and I on the Senate
Veterans Affairs Committee are con-
tinuing to build on that foundation. I
am hopeful that we can advance the
three particular pieces of legislation I
am about to highlight so that we can
give help to veterans at risk of suicide.
Senator WARNER and I recently intro-
duced the IMPROVE Wellbeing for Vet-
erans Act. This bill will enable the VA
to harness the potential of what is al-
ready occurring in communities by al-
lowing it to provide grant funding to
nonprofits and local organizations for
expanded outreach to veterans.
Our bill enhances coordination and
planning of veteran mental health and
suicide prevention services and will
better measure the effectiveness of
these programs in order to reduce the
alarming number of veteran suicides.
We can work with veteran-serving
nonprofits to create and use a standard
measurement tool that helps us in this
area.
Some nonprofit groups have imple-
mented their own tools to track
progress and monitor the results of
their programs.
The VA should examine how it can
work with partners to develop or adopt
a measurement tool that will be used
uniformly across all groups. This will
allow the VA and its partners to iden-
tify which suicide prevention efforts
are having the most impact so that re-
sources can be concentrated appro-
priately.
VA Secretary Robert Wilkie called
the IMPROVE Wellbeing for Veterans
Act ‘‘key’’ to unlocking the veterans
suicide crisis.
I am pleased with the support we
have received from the Secretary,
members of the committee, and other
colleagues, and I encourage other Sen-
ators to cosponsor this important leg-
islation that will make a positive im-
pact on our effort to reduce veteran
suicides.
It is also important to make it easier
for veterans in crisis to get the help
they need. That is why I teamed up
with Senator MANCHIN to introduce the
SPEED Act. This legislation would es-
tablish a three-digit number that is
easy for veterans to remember in order
to reach the Veterans Crisis Line. In a
crisis, time is of the essence. Providing
a more direct line of communication
will save lives.
Created in 2007, the Veterans Crisis
Line has answered over 3.5 million
calls. This has been an essential tool to
prevent veteran suicides. By taking an
additional step to simplify the number,
we can make further strides and expe-
dite assistance to veterans in crisis.
The VA has indicated that suicide
prevention is its highest clinical pri-
ority. To help improve its operation,
oversight, and evaluations of its sui-
cide prevention media outreach cam-
paigns, we have partnered with Senator
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL to introduce the
Reach Every Veteran in Crisis Act.
This bill supports recommendations by
the Government Accountability Office
study that found gaps in the VA’s sui-
cide prevention media outreach activi-
ties.
By delivering an action plan for the
VA to follow, we can isolate meaning-
ful suicide prevention programs and en-
sure resources are focused on efforts
that save lives.
An important provision of the legis-
lation requires establishing targets to
evaluate the effectiveness of the out-
reach campaign. It is vital that we
have metrics to measure the success of
the VA’s mental health and suicide
prevention programs.
As the chairman of the Military Con-
struction and Veterans Affairs Appro-
priations Subcommittee, I have been
pushing the VA to incorporate meas-
urement tools so that we can better
evaluate the effectiveness of VA pro-
grams. That is why, in the subcommit-
tee’s fiscal year 2019 bill, we incor-
porated language requiring the VA to
report to Congress the metrics it uses
to evaluate the efficacy of all of its
mental health and suicide prevention
programs.
My colleagues and I are committed
to upend the trend of veteran suicide.
We are blessed to have many organiza-
tions devoted to this common goal.
Together, we can make a positive dif-
ference in the lives of veterans and
their families and give them hope for a
brighter tomorrow.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

AMERICAN OPPORTUNITY CARBON FEE ACT OF
2019
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, last
year, the United States weathered 14
different disasters costing $1 billion or
more, including 2 hurricanes that cost
more than $25 billion in damages. Just
in the past 3 years, the annual average
of billion-dollar disasters has doubled
compared to what it has been over the
long term. These numbers give us a
sense of what extreme weather and cli-
mate inaction will cost us, but the
hundreds of billions of dollars of dam-
ages we have seen from extreme weath-
er over the past few years do not cap-
ture the full costs.
An economist named Gary Yohe re-
cently pointed out in a Washington
Post article that extreme weather
doesn’t simply damage or destroy prop-
erty. These events require people, busi-
nesses, and government to take money
they would have spent elsewhere and
put it toward rebuilding. So instead of
promoting growth or investing in busi-
ness or communities, we are treading
water by putting billions of dollars
into just rebuilding the status quo.
Yohe calculates that if we have similar
extreme weather events over the next
10 years, the U.S. GDP will be 3.6 per-
cent lower. So, in 2029, our economy
will be $1 trillion poorer because of ex-
treme weather and climate change.
This is why actuaries have named cli-
mate change the No. 1 risk to North
American insurers. This isn’t the Con-
servation Council for Hawai’i. This
isn’t the Sierra Club. This is not the
League of Conservation Voters. These
are actuaries. They named climate
change the No. 1 risk to North Amer-
ican insurers. That is why insurance
executives are warning that the world
will be uninsurable if climate change
accelerates.
Risks that come with climate
change—extreme fires and droughts,
sea rise and hurricanes—threaten eco-
nomic growth and financial instability
across sectors. This is no longer in the
future tense. This is no longer hypo-
thetical. Climate change is happening
right now and is forcing businesses to
change their approach right now. In
Europe and the United States, insur-
ance companies have publicly an-
nounced they will no longer do busi-
ness with mining and coal companies.
Alliance, Chubb, AXA, Zurich, Swiss
Re, and others have all decided they
can’t insure coal anymore. They can’t
underwrite or invest in the industry
without taking on too much risk.
This is part of a trend across the pri-
vate sector and across the world.
Farmers, private equity groups, share-
holders, and regulators are all looking
at the economic risks of climate
change and changing their strategies
to mitigate these risks. They are wor-
ried about the cost of goods, the profit-
ability of businesses, the stability of
the market. They are worried about
the new and growing risk of droughts,
floods, storms, wildfires, and sea level
rise because these events reduce the
value of assets. They decrease invest-
ment income. They increase insured
and uninsured losses. In other words,
they are disrupting our financial insti-
tutions. The health of our financial
system is at stake, and the cost of in-
action is higher than the cost of ac-
tion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4690 July 8, 2019
The U.S. Government cannot be
alone. Like the private sector and
other countries, it is in all of our best
interests to deal with climate change
and to invest in an energy system for
the future. The best thing we can do
that will make the biggest difference is
to put a price on carbon.
The carbon fee is straightforward and
it is simple: unleash the markets to
tackle climate change by requiring
companies to pay for the emissions
they are responsible for. Senators
WHITEHOUSE, HEINRICH, GILLIBRAND,
and I have introduced a carbon pricing
piece of legislation that will allow us
to address nearly all greenhouse gas
emissions.
Our bill establishes a set of incen-
tives for businesses to stop using dirty
fuels so the free market can compete,
innovate, and make money building
the energy future we need.
We also give businesses something
they say they crave, which is cer-
tainty. It is challenging to make in-
vestment choices when the private sec-
tor is subjugated to the idiosyncrasies
of politics. The last administration had
a Clean Power Plan and Paris Agree-
ment and now there is no Clean Power
Plan and no Paris Agreement. In the
meantime, companies are trying to
plan a business strategy beyond an
election cycle. A price on carbon put in
place by Congress is much more certain
than an Executive order and cannot be
overturned or not enforced.
You don’t have to take my word for
it. The business community is orga-
nizing for a carbon fee for this very
reason. Oil companies with big name
brands have joined together to support
a carbon pricing proposal by something
called the Climate Leadership Council.
One of the top benefits they cite is pre-
dictability.
There are many other things we can
do about climate. We can invest in
clean jobs. We can invest in nuclear.
We can work on carbon capture. We
can certainly fund innovation. We can
do solar and wind. I am for conserva-
tion and efficiency. The point is there
is no silver bullet, but there is silver
buckshot. In other words, we are going
to have to do all of these things, and
the best way to get all of these things
done is to simply assign a price to car-
bon and let the market take over. That
is why we should move forward with
our legislation.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico.
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak as in
morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, a new
generation of young leaders in my
home State of New Mexico and all
around the world recognizes that the
climate crisis is not just urgent, it is
literally existential. These young stu-
dents and activists are demanding that
their elected leaders get to work on im-
plementing solutions to limit its dev-
astating impact.
I heard from many students in New
Mexico about how we should confront
the climate crisis. Earlier this year, I
sat down with students in Santa Fe to
hear their ideas on how we should con-
front this crisis. These students showed
an incredible depth of knowledge on
climate science and on their changing
atmosphere. They are observing how
the climate crisis is already impacting
their daily lives. Talking with young
people who are calling on us to save
their future drives home how urgent
this issue is for our next generation.
It is not just high school or college
students. I want to read to you from a
couple of handwritten letters I recently
received from elementary school stu-
dents in New Mexico.
Brook is 9 years old from Albu-
querque. She wrote to me: ‘‘The Earth
is important to me because if we don’t
take care of earth now things are going
to get much worse, please do some-
thing.’’
Orla, age 10, from Rio Rancho, wrote:
The Earth is important to me because
Earth is the only planet perfect for us. Earth
is the place we live, plants live, where other
creatures big and small live. And if we don’t
do something about this now, our Earth will
not be Earth, but Junk. We will have no
place to live. Please do something. NOW!
If these children can see so clearly
how important it is, how desperately
urgent it is to fight for the future of
the planet, why on Earth can’t our Na-
tion’s leaders here in Washington? I
think it is long past time for us to lis-
ten to our children who are pleading
for us to take action and to leave them
with a better world in which to live. It
is long past time for us to think
through substantive solutions that can
move us away from carbon pollution
that is causing this crisis.
That means we should refuse to con-
tinue down the climate deniers’ desired
path of inaction. That will only keep
us moving toward more and more cost-
ly disruptions for our children. I am fo-
cused on implementing real and prag-
matic solutions to eliminate this pollu-
tion. That is why I was proud to join
with Senator WHITEHOUSE of Rhode Is-
land and Senator SCHATZ of Hawaii to
introduce legislation this year that
will finally put a price on carbon. The
scientific consensus is clear—the de-
structive wildfires in my home State,
the catastrophic hurricanes, and the
extreme flooding we are experiencing
are all directly linked to our pollution.
When we look at the climate mod-
eling, one of the surest and, for that
matter, one of the cheapest ways we
can move the needle is by finally put-
ting a price on carbon pollution be-
cause the truth is carbon pollution
isn’t free. We are all paying the price
for carbon pollution in the billions of
dollars we are spending each and every
year to recover from climate disrup-
tions of more extreme wildfires, floods,
and storms. We need to stop socializing
the cost of that pollution and ask those
who produce it to bear its true costs. In
other words, we need to internalize the
price of carbon pollution at the source.
Our legislation, the American Oppor-
tunity Carbon Fee Act, would collect a
fee from carbon polluters. It would also
include a border adjustment provision
to ensure that American manufactur-
ers would still be able to compete on a
level playing field and that inter-
national carbon polluters would pay a
price. The fee for carbon pollution
under our bill would start at $52 a ton,
and it would rise 6 percent each year.
This matches the midrange of the esti-
mated cost of carbon that researchers
at the Office of Management and Budg-
et, under the previous administration,
determined in 2016. Roughly translated,
this is the cost that carbon pollution is
already costing you and your neighbors
because of its devastating effects. This
is the cost that pollution producers
should be paying, and we can put the
revenues raised by this fee on carbon
pollution directly to work helping
American households.
Our legislation would raise a pro-
jected $2.3 trillion over 10 years that
would be returned directly to American
families in the States to transition us
toward a clean energy economy. States
would receive $10 billion a year to help
pay for their transition toward clean
energy and a clean energy workforce.
This transition represents our greatest
opportunity to create millions of new
jobs all across our Nation and particu-
larly in our rural communities. Wind
technology and solar are already two of
the fastest growing jobs in the Nation.
States need to put real resources into
training our workers for these clean
energy jobs, and our legislation would
make that happen.
The rest of the revenue from our leg-
islation would be delivered directly to
American families in the form of tax
credits and Social Security and vet-
erans’ benefits. This is the responsible
way forward. This is the type of mar-
ket-based climate policy that should
have the support of both Democrats
and Republicans.
We know that to meet our climate
goals and to limit the damage wrought
by the climate crisis, we must imme-
diately change our trajectory. We must
move toward an economy that is run
entirely—yes, 100 percent—on clean,
pollution-free energy.
Our proposal is just one way to take
a major Federal action that would
move us quickly in that direction—and
I would welcome a full debate in the
Senate on the best way forward—but
what is abundantly clear is that we can
no longer afford to debate whether to
move forward.
Our climate crisis often feels too big,
too complex, too hard to fix. However,
the scientific fact is, we have created
this problem, and we possess the cre-
ativity and the tools and the tech-
nology to fix it. Our kids understand
better than even most of us do that we
need to act urgently and decisively.
That is what leadership is all about.
That is our job.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4691
July 8, 2019
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, we
have just heard two colleagues make
convincing and compassionate argu-
ments for putting a price on carbon,
the central protection from climate
crisis.
A price on carbon like we propose
would dramatically lower emissions
and put us on a net-zero-by-2050 path,
the path necessary to avoid the worst
climate chaos. Because it is a price on
pollution, we can dial it up or dial it
down as climate chaos worsens or
abates. Because our proposal is border-
adjustable, it would let American in-
dustry compete even in countries with-
out a price on carbon. Because our plan
is revenue neutral, all the funds go
back to the American people in the
form of payroll tax credits, Social Se-
curity or VA benefits, or grants to
States to navigate this transition.
If our plan is so good, you might
think it would already be on its way to
becoming law. You might think there
would be Senate hearings on it or bi-
partisan negotiations. Well, none of the
above. To understand why that is tak-
ing place, you have to look at who is
supporting carbon pricing and who is
opposed.
Let’s start with the good news. Who
is supporting it? Earlier this year, 27
winners of the Nobel Prize in econom-
ics—27 Nobel prize-winning econo-
mists—15 former Chairs of the Presi-
dent’s Council of Economic Advisers,
more than half of them marked here in
red are Republicans; 4 former Chairs of
the Federal Reserve, half of them Re-
publicans; and 2 Treasury Secretaries,
including a Republican, in the Wall
Street Journal, no less, endorsed a bor-
der-adjustable price on carbon with
revenues returned to the American
people— in other words, a carbon price
very like our bill.
Even the patron saint of conservative
economists, Milton Friedman, himself
a Nobel Prize winner, made the case
that it is proper under conservative ec-
onomics for government to put a price
on pollution.
[T]he best way to do it is to impose a tax
on the cost of the pollutants . . . and make
an incentive for . . . manufacturers and for
consumers to keep down the amount of pol-
lution.
Four former Republican Administra-
tors of the Environmental Protection
Agency—for President Nixon, Presi-
dent Reagan, and both President
Bushes—advocated for a price on car-
bon in the New York Times.
There is burgeoning support in the
business community. In May, dozens of
companies, with a combined market
cap of nearly $2.5 trillion, came to Con-
gress to advocate for a price on carbon.
CEOs of 13 major corporations recently
announced the formation of the CEO
Climate Dialogue to do the same. All
these CEOs and corporations may be
responding to an explosion of warnings
coming from economic regulators here
and abroad, national banks here and
abroad, government agencies here and
abroad, and risk analysts, who do this
kind of thing professionally, that we
are headed for economic perils if cli-
mate change is not addressed with an
effective, predictable remedy, like a
price on carbon emissions.
Last month, even Pope Francis con-
vened a 2-day summit at the Vatican
on climate change, where he urged gov-
ernments, businesses, and oil compa-
nies to get serious about climate
change and to follow carbon pricing as
the smart path forward, calling it ‘‘es-
sential.’’
By the way, to do a little moral wan-
der here, Pope Francis is not alone
among religious leaders in seeing a
moral imperative to solving this prob-
lem.
The head of the Church of England
said that ‘‘[r]educing the cost of cli-
mate change is essential to the life of
faith. It is a way to love our neighbour
and to steward the gift of creation.’’
Two hundred thirty-two evangelical
pastors from 44 States declared that
‘‘[l]ove of God, love of neighbor, and
the demands of stewardship are more
than enough reason for evangelical
Christians to respond to the climate
change problem with moral passion and
concrete action.’’
Forty-three rabbis from around the
world stated that ‘‘Jewish teachings
mandate that we do everything pos-
sible to help avert a climate catas-
trophe and other environmental disas-
ters and to help shift our imperiled
planet onto a sustainable path.’’
Likewise, leaders and scholars of the
Islamic, Hindu, and Buddhist faiths
have urged climate action, including
pricing carbon.
With all this support, particularly
from so many Republicans, you would
think that carbon pricing would be a
no-brainer and that we would be al-
ready at work here in Congress doing
something. Unfortunately, if you
thought that, you would be wrong.
The bad news is who is opposed to
carbon pricing and what dirty tools
they bring to that job. Here is one ex-
ample: Last month, hints of interest in
carbon pricing appeared from a few
House Republicans, and suddenly an
‘‘open letter’’ appeared opposing car-
bon pricing. The letter was signed by
all these entities with happy-sounding
names like Americans for Tax Reform,
Americans for Prosperity, Citizens
Against Government Waste. Such nice
names.
You might think this letter rep-
resents grassroots popular opposition
to carbon pricing. You would be wrong.
These groups have a common identi-
fier: They keep their funding sources
secret. But skilled investigative jour-
nalists and researchers who spent
countless hours digging through cor-
porate tax filings and other documents
have unearthed the funders. And guess
what. The vast majority of these
groups are funded with fossil fuel
money. They are front groups. They
are not real.
We actually added it up. The groups
behind this letter received collectively
over half a billion dollars from groups
linked to the fossil fuel billionaire
Koch brothers, ExxonMobil, the Amer-
ican Petroleum Institute, and other
fossil fuel interests. It is a complete
front. Half a billion dollars is a lot. Re-
member, that is just what the re-
searchers could find. Because these
front groups hide their funding so well,
the true number is probably several
times that, probably billions of dollars.
It sounds disgusting, doesn’t it—an
industry hiding behind front groups to
spend billions of dollars to gum up a
remedy to our climate crisis? But why
wouldn’t the fossil fuel industry spend
a few billion dollars to block climate
action here in Congress? The annual
U.S. subsidy for fossil fuel was most re-
cently estimated by the International
Monetary Fund at $650 billion. Against
that fat annual subsidy, spending a few
billion is just a rounding error.
Look at one example from this flo-
tilla of phony front-group signatories:
Americans for Tax Reform, with its
president Grover Norquist, which
claims to represent the regular tax-
payer. Hogwash. Americans for Tax Re-
form has received over $5 million from
Koch-linked groups—Koch Industries,
the big fossil fuel company—and over
$800,000 from the American Petroleum
Institute. They are hired guns, and
they are wearing masks so you don’t
know who is paying them. That group
is just one tentacle of the fossil fuel
climate denial apparatus. They have
even taken over the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce and the National Associa-
tion of Manufacturers and turned those
business groups into fossil fuel zombies
on climate change.
It is time to say enough.
I ask my colleagues to please take a
sincere look at climate change and car-
bon pricing and look at who is saying
what. On one side, you have the moral
authority of the great religions. You
have bipartisan agreement of the
world’s best economists. You have lots
of Republicans—at least ones who don’t
have to face elections. You have lots of
tough, smart business leaders. My God,
you even have your home State univer-
sities that teach this stuff. On the
other side, you have a bunch of hired
guns, hiding behind phony front-group
masks, funded with fossil fuel money
that they try to hide. Who are you
going to trust? Pope Francis or the
oily, secretive Koch brothers? Milton
Friedman or fossil-fuel hit man Grover
Norquist? The International Monetary
Fund or ExxonMobil, the company that
has been caught out lying for decades
about climate change over and over
again? Front groups who hide their do-
nors—isn’t that a clue? Can we as a
body, as the Senate, really not discern
where the conflict of interest lies,
where the record of lying lies?
The climate crisis is real, and it is
accelerating. Bad as it is already, we
are just in the opening credits. It is
getting worse. The pages sitting here

on the Senate floor know this. The rest
of their lives will be spent coping with
the consequences of our failure, the
failure of the grownups—the sickening
failure of the grownups.
We have to get going here. We are
trying to do it your way. Pretty much
every Republican who has thought this
climate problem through to a solution
comes to the same place: a revenue-
neutral, border-adjustable price on car-
bon. That is what we offered. We can’t
come much further than that. We are
reaching out. We are trying to do it
your way. But the answer back can’t be
dictated by a fossil fuel industry that
has spent billions to deny and obscure
the facts, an industry that to this day
fights from behind a facade of lies.
I tell my Republican colleagues, they
have lied to you and lied to you, and
you should cut them loose. We are all
just back from the Fourth of July. How
about an independence day for the Re-
publican Party from the rotten rain of
the fossil fuel industry? Just cut them
loose.
Let’s do the job we have been en-
trusted with as Senators. Let’s look at

Let’s look at what our home State uni-
versities teach and what real busi-

gram cost is $223.56 million.
This proposed sale is consistent with U.S.
law and policy as expressed in Public Law 96–
8.
This proposed sale will support the foreign
policy and national security of the United
States by helping to improve the security
and defensive capability of the recipient, an
important force for political stability, mili-
tary balance, and economic progress in the
region.
The recipient intends to use these defense
articles and services to modernize its armed
forces and expand its existing air defense ar-
chitecture to counter threats. This will con-
tribute to the recipient military’s goal to up-
date its capability while further enhancing
greater interoperability between the recipi-
ent, the U.S., and other allies. The recipient
will have no difficulty absorbing this equip-
ment into its armed forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.
The principal contractors will be Raytheon
Missile Systems. There are no known offset
agreements proposed. However, the pur-
chaser typically requests offsets. Any offset
agreement will be defined in negotiations be-
tween the purchaser and the contractor.
Implementation of this proposed sale will
require 12 U.S. Government or contractor
representatives to travel to the recipient for
a period of 6 weeks (non-concurrent).
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.

July 8, 2019
The Stinger RMP Block I Missile, hard-
ware, embedded software object code and op-
erating documentation contain sensitive
technology and are classified CONFIDEN-
TIAL. The guidance section of the missile
and tracking head trainer contain highly
sensitive technology and are classified CON-
FIDENTIAL. Missile System hardware com-
ponents contain sensitive critical tech-
nologies. Stinger Block I critical technology
is primarily in the area of design and produc-
tion know-how and not end-items. This sen-
sitive/critical technology is inherent in the
hybrid microcircuit assemblies; micro-proc-
essors; magnetic and amorphous metals; pu-
rification; firmware; printed circuit boards;
laser roll rate sensor; dual detector assem-
bly; detector filters; optical coatings; ultra-
violet sensors; compounding and handling of
electronic, electro-optic, and optical mate-
rials; test equipment operating instructions;
energetic materials fabrication and loading
technology; warhead components and seeker
assembly. Information on countermeasures
vulnerability to electronic countermeasures,
system performance capabilities and effec-
tiveness, simulation and test data and soft-
ware source code are classified up to SE-
CRET.
2. If a technologically advanced adversary
were to obtain knowledge of the hardware
and software elements, the information
could be used to develop countermeasures or
equivalent systems which might reduce sys-
tem effectiveness or be used in the develop-
ment of a system with similar or advanced
capabilities.
3. A determination has been made that the
recipient can provide substantially the same
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-

tics and program support. The total esti-
mated program cost is $2.00 billion.
This proposed sale is consistent with U.S.
law and policy as expressed in Public Law 96–
8.
This proposed sale serves U.S. national,
economic, and security interests by sup-
porting the recipient’s continuing efforts to
modernize its armed forces and to maintain
a credible defensive capability. The proposed
sale will help improve the security of the re-
cipient and assist in maintaining political
stability, military balance, and economic
progress in the region.
This proposed sale of M1A2 tanks will con-
tribute to the modernization of the recipi-
ent’s main battle tank fleet, enhancing its
ability to meet current and future regional
threats and to strengthen its homeland de-
fense. These tanks will contribute to the re-
cipient’s goal of updating its military capa-
bility while further enhancing interoper-
ability with the United States and other al-
lies. The recipient will have no difficulty ab-
sorbing this equipment into its armed forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.
The M1A2T tank prime contractor will be
General Dynamics Land Systems, Sterling
Heights, Michigan. Production will be at An-
niston Army Depot, Anniston, Alabama, and
the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center,
Lima, Ohio. The M88A2 recovery vehicle
prime contractor will be BAE, York, Penn-
sylvania. The M1070A1 Heavy Equipment
Transporter (HET) prime contractor will be
Oshkosh, Oshkosh, Wisconsin. There are no
known offset agreements proposed. However,
the purchaser typically requests offsets. Any
offset agreement will be defined in negotia-
tions between the purchaser and the con-
tractor.
Implementation of this proposed sale will
require annual trips to the recipient involv-
ing up to 30 U.S. Government and 15 con-
tractor representatives for a period of up to
six years to manage the fielding and training
for the program.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.
TRANSMITTAL NO. 19–22
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the
Arms Export Control Act
Annex Item No. vii
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
1. Thermal Imaging System (TIS). The TIS
is a target acquisition system which, when
operated with other tank systems, gives the
tank crew a substantial advantage over the
adversary. The TIS provides the gunner and
commander with the ability to effectively
aim and fire the tank main armament sys-
tem under a broad range of adverse battle-
field conditions. The Hunter/Killer tech-
nology provides the commander the ability
to search for and acquire targets while the
gunner engages priority targets. The hard-
ware itself is UNCLASSIFIED. The engineer-
ing design and manufacturing data associ-
ated with the detector and infrared (IR) op-
tics and coatings are considered sensitive.
The technical data package is UNCLASSI-
FIED with the exception of the specifica-
tions for target acquisition range (CON-
FIDENTIAL), nuclear hardening (CON-
FIDENTIAL, restricted data) and laser hard-
ening (SECRET).
2. Special Armor. Major components of spe-
cial armor are fabricated in sealed modules
and in serialized removable subassemblies.
Special armor vulnerability data for both
chemical and kinetic energy rounds are clas-
sified SECRET. Engineering design and man-
ufacturing data related to special armor are
also classified SECRET.
3. AGT 1500 Gas Turbine Propulsion Sys-
tem. The use of a gas turbine propulsion sys-
tem in the MIA2T Abrams tank is a unique
application of armored vehicle power pack
technology. The AGT–1500 engine and X–1100
transmission are not classified. Manufac-
turing processes associated with the produc-
tion of turbine blades, recuperator, bearings
and shafts, and hydrostatic pump and motor,
are proprietary and therefore are commer-
cially competition sensitive.
4. Compartmentation. A major surviv-
ability feature of the Abrams Tank is the
compartmentation of fuel and ammunition.
Compartmentation is the positive separation
of the crew and critical components from
combustible materials so that in the event
the fuel or ammunition ignites or is deto-
nated by an incoming round, the crew is
fully protected. As demonstrated during the
Abram Live Fire tests, compartmentation
significantly enhances crew survivability
and substantially reduces the likelihood of
the tank being immobilized by an ammuni-
tion explosion and fire. Sensitive informa-
tion (SBU) includes the performance of the
ammunition compartments as well as the
compartment design parameters.
5. The CROWS–LP (M153A2El) is a com-
mander’s weapon station. It allows for under
armor operation of weapons—M2HB, M2Al,
M240B and M240. The CROWS–LP is an up-
dated version of the M153A2 CROWS and is
approximately 10 inches lower in height. The
CROWS–LP increases crew visibility over the
weapon station. The fire control system of
the CROWS–LP allows an operator to fire on
a target from either a stationary or moving
platform. The CROWS–LP integrates a day
camera (VIM–C), thermal camera (TIM 1500)
and laser range finder (STORM/STORM–PI)
is UNCLASSIFIED.
6. M76 Infra-Red (IR) Grenade. The M76 In-
fraRed (IR) grenade is UNCLASSIFIED but
sensitive. The grenade uses a brass particle
fill that is specifically designed, when shat-
tered by a high explosive shock wave, to dis-
perse in a cloud of specific sized particles.
These particles obscure the visual through
the far infrared portions of the electro-
magnetic spectrum. As a result, this grenade
defeats night sights, thermal viewers, laser
designators, laser rangefinders, and any
other equipment that relies on visual or in-
frared active or passive technologies. The
properties of the brass fill are easily reverse
engineered, and therefore could be used to
defeat U.S. imaging and targeting systems
on the battlefield. The highest level of infor-
mation that could be transferred with the
sale of this round is UNCLASSIFIED.
7. 120mm Kinetic Energy-Tungsten (KE-W)
ammunition. This is a commercially devel-
oped item and is not warranted by the US
Government. All components of the car-
tridge, 120mm Kinetic Energy-Tungsten are
UNCLASSIFIED. The capabilities of this
cartridge, to include the terminal effects,
target impact dispersion, and armor defeat-
ing capabilities, are classified CONFIDEN-
TIAL, except for armor penetration test re-
sults against Special Armored Targets,
which are classified SECRET, or the same
level of classification as the target, which-
ever is greater. The tungsten processing and
penetrator manufacturing methods are sen-
sitive data. No technological information re-
garding the tungsten penetrator material
will be supplied with the cartridges being
considered for foreign military sales. The
highest level of information that could be
transferred with the sale of this round is UN-
CLASSIFIED.
8. If a technologically advanced adversary
were to obtain knowledge of the hardware
and software elements, the information
could be used to develop countermeasures or
equivalent systems which might reduce sys-
tem effectiveness or he used in the develop-
ment of a system with similar or advanced
capabilities.
9. A determination has been made that the
recipient can provide substantially the same
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification.
10. All defense articles and services listed
in this transmittal have been authorized for
release and export to the recipient.

TRIBUTE TO JOHN FALKENBURY
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, today I
wish to pay tribute to my constituent
and friend, John Falkenbury who is re-
tiring this month as president and COO
of the USO of North Carolina. John has
served the USO in North Carolina suc-
cessfully since March 2009.
In this role, John has been respon-
sible for planning, organizing, and di-
recting the operations of the Sate
headquarters, five USO fixed centers,
and a mobile center in the areas in and
surrounding Jacksonville, Charlotte,
Fayetteville, and Raleigh-Durham, NC.
These base and airport centers provide
a full range of important services in-
cluding critical resiliency, transition
assistance, financial literacy, and chil-
dren’s educational programs; travel as-
sistance at Charlotte Douglas Inter-
national, Raleigh-Durham, and Fay-
etteville airports; deployment and
homecoming operations; internet and
video link access; military and civilian
community outreach programs; fallen
and Wounded Warrior escort services;
holiday feasts; and extensive morale-
boosting activities.
Remarkably, in the aftermath of
Hurricane Matthew, the USO of North
Carolina was able to quickly arrange
for nearly 1,000 care packages that
were airlifted by Blackhawk heli-
copters to soldiers and civilians in the
stricken areas. For 5 days, the mobile
center deployed within 24 hours to es-
tablish a center in the Guard’s primary
and austere ‘‘tent city’’ near Lum-
berton and provided basic necessity
items, a BBQ dinner, satellite, and
internet services to over 400 soldiers.
I also rise today to thank Mr.
Falkenbury for his 20 years of service
in the U.S. Army prior to his work for
the USO. His military experience in-
cluded assignments throughout the
United States and in Germany, includ-
ing battalion executive officer, 2nd Ar-
mored Division, Fort Hood, TX; chief of
operations and later director of public
affairs, 56th Field Artillery Command,
Germany; director of public affairs,
U.S. Army War College and Carlisle
Barracks at Carlisle Barracks, PA.
I am honored to congratulate John
Falkenbury on his retirement from a
career of distinguished public service
and to thank him for his commitment
to this great Nation.

S4696 July 8, 2019
Strauss, a WWII veteran who served his
country with bravery, honor, and dis-
tinction and who continues to inspire
Arkansans as an active member of his
community.
Bill was born on October 27, 1919.
This year, his friends, family, and com-
munity have planned a number of
events to celebrate his 100th birthday
and recognize his endless commitment
to serving others.
Bill has led a life of service. He was
drafted into the U.S. Army in January
1942 and assigned to the 73rd Field Ar-
tillery of the 9th Armored Division—
the ‘‘Phantom Division’’—which val-
iantly helped defeat the Germans at
the Battle of the Bulge.
For his selfless service, Bill earned
numerous awards, including the Euro-
pean African Middle Eastern Theater
Ribbon with three Bronze Battle Stars.
In recent years, he was also awarded
the French Legion of Honor.
When he was honorably discharged in
1945, Bill returned home and married
the late Betty Dean Saulsman. The
couple raised four children.
Bill moved to Salem, AR, in 1995 and
has been a leader in the community. He
is a lifetime member of the VFW and
continues to be an active member of
VFW Post 9777. He shares the memories
of his WWII service and his stories of
the Battle of the Bulge at schools and
at various community events.
Like his fellow servicemembers, Bill
defined the Greatest Generation. Their
sacrifice and dedication changed the
course of history. After serving in un-
imaginable circumstances in Europe,
Bill came home and set about creating
a stronger nation, something he con-
tinues today. I want to thank him for
his service and wish him a very happy
100th birthday.∑

TRIBUTE TO CLYDE TERRY
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, today I
would like to recognize the retirement
of Mr. Clyde Terry of Concord, NH.
Clyde started his career in 1982 as an
administrative hearings officer, pro-
tecting the rights of individuals who
experience disabilities in the State
service systems.
He then worked as the director of
policy and planning for the New Hamp-
shire Developmental Disabilities Coun-
cil. He was promoted to executive di-
rector where he assisted in the drafting
of and advocated for State and Federal
legislation on issues impacting the
lives of people who experience disabil-
ities and directed the 5-year State
plan.
In 2010, he was named to the National
Council on Disabilities by President
Barack Obama and was appointed its
chair in 2015. Clyde also served as the
chair of the policy development and
program evaluation committee, and in
both roles, he used his vast knowledge
and experience in New Hampshire to
guide his work.
For more than 16 years, Clyde has led
Granite State Independent Living, a
nonprofit that provides training and
support services for people experi-
encing disabilities. In this role, he
aimed to break the historical link be-
tween disability and poverty, adding
education and employment services to
the organization’s operations. Under
his leadership, Granite State Inde-
pendent Living grew from three offices
to eight and increased staff to more
than 850 full-time staff and personal
care attendants. This growth has made
the organization a statewide resource
for seniors and those who experience
disabilities, helping them have access
to competitive integrated employment
and to live safely, comfortably, and
independently at home.
In addition, Clyde has been an incred-
ible advocate for democracy and equal-
ity in our elections, leading a national
coalition of disability organizations on
election reform and election accessi-
bility and coauthoring ‘‘Voters Denied
Equal Access at the Polls; A Status Re-
port of the Accessibility of Polling
Places in the United States.’’
Clyde has helped people understand
that all of our citizens deserve equal-
ity, opportunity, and community par-
ticipation. More and more people are
living lives of self-sufficiency and pur-
pose because of his hard work and com-
mitment, and I have been honored to
work with Clyde on building a more in-
clusive New Hampshire and country.
I hope you will join me in honoring a
dedicated Granite Stater, Clyde
Terry.∑

RECOGNIZING SNAKE RIVER GRILL
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, small
businesses make up a significant por-
tion of the retail and food services in-
dustry in my home State of Idaho and
around the country. In Idaho, small
businesses employ 68 percent of work-
ers in the food services sector. As a
member and former chairman of the
Senate Committee on Small Business
and Entrepreneurship, I am proud to
recognize Snake River Grill as the
Idaho Small Business of the Month for
July 2019. Located in Hagerman, Snake
River Grill has provided exceptional
service and quality food in a wel-
coming environment for more than two
decades.
Like many Idahoans, Kirt Martin fell
in love with the beautiful scenery and
the genuine people in the Gem State
and decided to call Idaho home in 1988.
Kirt served our country in Vietnam as
a member of the U.S. Navy and devel-
oped an appreciation for culinary prac-
tices around the world during his tour
of service.
After graduating from the College of
Southern Idaho and Le Cordon Bleu
culinary school in Ottawa, Canada,
Kirt capitalized on his passions and
opened Snake River Grill in 1995. As a
third-generation cook and an avid fish-
er and hunter, he uses his expertise in
French cuisine to put a unique spin on
classic Idaho meals. Snake River Grill
offers dishes such as Idaho sturgeon,
steelhead, trout, and alligator. Chef
Kirt uses locally sourced fish, game,
and seasonal ingredients from local
farmers markets. Kirt hosts a weekly
wild game dinner at his restaurant,
bringing specialty dishes to patrons
from across the region.
When he is not on the job, you can
find Chef Kirt hunting and fishing and
spending time with his triplet sons,
Daniel, Andrew, and Benjamin. Kirt’s
wife, Carol, helps him run Snake River
Grill and even makes all of the home-
made pies herself. Chef Kirt is often
found catering events and teaching
cooking classes throughout the Magic
Valley. He has been known to teach at
the College of Southern Idaho and
Hagerman High School, as well as over-
seas in Macau and Hong Kong. He
starred in the PBS Outdoor Channel
television series, ‘‘Cooking on the Wild
Side,’’ which featured hunting field
trips through Idaho followed by lessons
from Kirt on how to cook wild game.
He has authored cookbooks and pro-
duced cooking videos so people every-
where can learn how to prepare wild
game.
The State of Idaho is proud to be a
home for creative small businesses like
Snake River Grill. Chef Kirt’s commit-
ment to providing unique meals and ex-
periences allows his customers to enjoy
an excellent product produced in their
own community. I would like to extend
my sincerest congratulations to Chef
Kirt Martin, his wife Carol, and to the
employees of Snake River Grill for
being selected as the July 2019 Idaho
Small Business of the Month. You
make our great State proud, and I look
forward to watching your continued
growth and success.∑
