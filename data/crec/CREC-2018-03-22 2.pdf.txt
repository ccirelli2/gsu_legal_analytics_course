Section 1 of the Act is the short title of the
bill.
Section 2 of the Act displays a table of con-
tents.
Section 3 of the Act states that, unless ex-
pressly provided otherwise, any reference to
‘‘this Act’’ contained in any division shall be
treated as referring only to the provisions of
that division.
Section 4 of the Act states that this ex-
planatory statement shall have the same ef-
fect with respect to the allocation of funds
and implementation of this legislation as if
it were a joint explanatory statement of a
committee of conference.
Section 5 of the Act provides a statement
of appropriations.
Section 6 of the Act states that each
amount designated by Congress as being for
Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War
on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT) is contingent on
the President so designating all such OCO/
GWOT amounts and transmitting such des-
ignations to Congress. The provision is con-
sistent with the requirements in the Budget
Control Act of 2011.
Section 7 of the Act addresses salaries and
compensation rates and provides for a death
gratuity.
The Act does not contain any congres-
sional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or lim-
ited tariff benefits as defined by clause 9 of
rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives.
DIVISION A—AGRICULTURE, RURAL DE-
VELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINIS-
TRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES AP-
PROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018
CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTIVES
The explanatory statement is silent on
provisions that were in both the House Re-
port (H. Rpt. 115–232) and Senate Report (S.
Rpt. 115–131) that remain unchanged by this
agreement, except as noted in this explana-
tory statement.
The agreement restates that executive
branch wishes cannot substitute for
Congress’s own statements as to the best evi-
dence of congressional intentions, which are
the official reports of the Congress. The
agreement further points out that funds in
this Act must be used for the purposes for
which appropriated, as required by section
1301 of title 31 of the United States Code,
which provides: ‘‘Appropriations shall be ap-
plied only to the objects for which the appro-
priations were made except as otherwise pro-
vided by law.’’
The House and Senate report language
that is not changed by the explanatory
statement is approved and indicates congres-
sional intentions. The explanatory state-
ment, while repeating some report language
for emphasis, does not intend to negate the
language referred to above unless expressly
provided herein.
In cases in which the House or the Senate
have directed the submission of a report,
such report is to be submitted to both the
House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions no later than 60 days after enactment
of this Act, unless otherwise directed.
Hereafter, in division A of this statement,
the term the Committees’ refers to the Com-
mittees on Appropriations of the House of
Representatives and the Senate.
For the appropriations provided by this
Act and previous Acts, the departments and
agencies funded by this agreement are re-
minded that the Committees use the defini-
tions for transfer, reprogramming, and pro-
gram, project, and activity as defined by the
Government Accountability Office (GAO) in
GAO–04–261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I
and GAO–05–734SP Budget Glossary.
A transfer is the shifting of funds between
appropriations. It applies to (1) transfers
from one agency to another, (2) transfers
from one account to another within the same
agency, and (3) transfers to an interagency
or intra-agency working fund. In each in-
stance, statutory authority is required.
Reprogramming is the utilization of funds
in an appropriation account for purposes
other than those contemplated at the time of
appropriation. It is the shifting of funds from
one object to another within an appropria-
tion.
A program, project, or activity (PPA) is an
element within a budget account. PPAs are
identified by reference to include the most
specific level of budget items identified in
the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food
and Drug Administration, and Related Agen-
cies Act, 2018, accompanying Committee re-
ports, explanatory statements, the State-
ment of Managers, and budget justifications.
Program activity structures are intended to
provide a meaningful representation of the
operations financed by a specific budget ac-
count by project, activity, or organization.
For fiscal year 2018, the Committees con-
tinue to include bill language requiring ad-
vanced notification of certain agency ac-
tions. Notification will be required at least

30 days in advance of any action if (1) a
major capital investment is modified; (2) an
office is realigned or reorganized; and (3) ac-
tivities are carried out that were not de-
scribed in the budget request.
The agreement directs the Office of Budget
and Program Analysis (OBPA) of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) to pro-
vide an organizational chart for each agency
funded by this Act to the division and sub-
division level, as appropriate, by May 1, 2018.
The agreement also directs the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and
the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) to
provide an organizational chart of each agen-
cy respectively to the division and subdivi-
sion level, as appropriate, by May 1, 2018.
Further, USDA, CFTC, and FDA should be
mindful of Congressional authority to deter-
mine and set final funding levels for fiscal
year 2019. Therefore, the agencies should not
presuppose program funding outcomes and
prematurely initiate action to redirect staff-
ing prior to knowing final outcomes on fiscal
year 2019 program funding. The agreement
directs OBPA to provide the Committees
with the number of staff years and employ-
ees on board for each agency funded by this
Act on a quarterly basis.
TITLE I
AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS
PROCESSING, RESEARCH AND MARKETING
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
The agreement provides $46,532,000 for the
Office of the Secretary.
The agreement directs the Secretary to
provide the report on the Commodity Credit
Corporation in H. Rpt. 115–232 under this
heading on May 16, 2018 and November 15,
2018.
The agreement recognizes the Department
has statutory authorities and programs de-
signed to help break the multi-generational
trap of poverty in rural counties and sup-
ports USDA’s utilization of existing pro-
grams and funding within Rural Develop-
ment (RD) and the Food and Nutrition Serv-
ice (FNS) in order to assist families, create
jobs, and develop a path towards self-suffi-
ciency. Other existing resources such as the
extension service and public universities can
be used for coordination and outreach activi-
ties. The Committees still await the detailed
plan required to be submitted by the Sec-
retary detailing all funding resources and
bundled services to combat rural poverty.
The agreement includes $600,000,000 for a
rural broadband pilot program to assist in
further closing the digital divide. Lack of
adequate broadband is an impediment to
rural economic development, and deploy-
ment of broadband service yields a multitude
of socio-economic benefits including: eco-
nomic growth, improved educational oppor-
tunities, and increased access to healthcare
options. The agreement reiterates that fund-
ing should be prioritized to areas currently
lacking access to broadband service, and in-
vestments in broadband shall consider any
technology that best serves the goals of
broadband expansion. Lastly, the agreement
restates the importance of coordination
among federal agencies in expanding
broadband deployment and adoption and ex-
pects the Department to take caution to
maximize these limited resources and not
overbuild or duplicate existing broadband ca-
pable infrastructure.
The agreement acknowledges that the
United States Department of Homeland Se-
curity (DHS) will continue to be responsible
for the construction of the National Bio and
Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). The agree-
ment provides an additional $4,000,000 to
USDA to support operational activities of
the NBAF.
In addition to $10,000,000 in mandatory
funding available to assist socially disadvan-
taged and veteran farmers and ranchers, the
agreement includes an additional $3,000,000
in discretionary funding for these activities.
It was the intent of Congress that the Sec-
retary consider the views of all producers
who suffered losses related to the con-
sequences of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma,
Maria, and other hurricanes and wildfires oc-
curring in calendar year 2017 in determining
eligibility for assistance provided in Title I
of Public Law No: 115–123.
The agreement provides an additional
$500,000,000 for Water and Waste grants and
loans to address infrastructure needs in
Rural America, and directs the Secretary to
prioritize communities that have the great-
est infrastructure needs.
On February 3, 2017, USDA restricted the
public’s access to the search tool for the Ani-
mal Care Inspection System, saying it need-
ed to conduct a comprehensive review of the
information on its website. USDA is now
posting heavily redacted inspection reports
that make it difficult in certain cases for the
public to understand the subject of the in-
spection, assess USDA’s subsequent actions,
and to evaluate the effectiveness of its en-
forcement. USDA’s actions to date do not
meet the requirements in H. Rpt. 115–232 that
the online searchable database should allow
analysis and comparison of data and include
all inspection reports, annual reports, and
other documents related to enforcement of
animal welfare laws. USDA is directed to
comply with these requirements and is re-
minded that as part of its oversight respon-
sibilities, Congress has the right to make
any inquiry it wishes into litigation in which
USDA is involved. USDA is directed to re-
spond to any such inquiries fully.

(APHIS), Salaries and Expenses.
The agreement includes a net increase of
$35,681,000 for high priority initiatives in
order to protect the plant and animal re-
sources of the Nation from pests and dis-
eases. The agreement provides increases
within the total funding level of: $7,500,000
for Avian Health to help pay for losses due to
low pathogenic avian influenza; $5,000,000 for
Cattle Health in support of the Cattle Fever
Tick Eradication Program; $2,000,000 for Ag-
ricultural Quarantine Inspection; $500,000 for
Field Crop and Rangeland Ecosystems Pests
in order to control or eradicate pests de-
stroying Roseau cane in wetlands near the

ment program.
The agreement provides $30,810,000 for the
Animal Welfare program. The agreement di-
rects that APHIS continue its inspections of
registered ARS research facilities to ensure
their adherence to the Animal Welfare Act.
To address the cattle fever tick infestation
in South Texas, the agreement provides an
additional $5,000,000 for all activities under
the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program
(CFTEP) for research and scientific tools
concentrating on the following: new system-
atic cattle fever tick treatment products
with longer treatment intervals for cattle;
new cattle fever tick treatment products for
wildlife, especially nilgai antelope; and new
or improved cattle fever tick preventative
therapies, such as vaccines, for both cattle
and wildlife hosts. APHIS and ARS are urged
to collaborate with Mexican National Ani-
mal Health Officials, Mexican State Animal
Health Officials from the Mexican states
that border Texas, and Mexican livestock
and wildlife industry representatives to de-
velop and implement a fever tick control or
eradication program that will reduce or
eliminate the fever tick population along the
Mexican side of the Rio Grande River, and
thus the threat of fever tick incursion pre-
sented by wildlife and livestock populations
across the Rio Grande from the permanent
quarantine zone in Texas.
The agreement includes no less than
$3,500,000 for cervid health activities. Within
the funds provided, APHIS should give con-
sideration to indemnity payments if war-
ranted.
The agreement directs APHIS to complete
the requirements under the Foreign Market
Access Requests heading in H.Rpt. 115–232 by

cy Coordination (HLB–MAC) group.
The agreement includes $28,000,000 under

rabies management, surveillance, and eradi-
cation efforts and $2,000,000 for Wildlife Serv-
ices education and training. The agreement
also provides $1,600,000 for combatting wild-
life depredation to production aquaculture
and an additional $5,000,000 for increased
feral swine surveillance. Additionally, no
less than $250,000 should be available for the
agency to reduce blackbird depredation in
the Northern Great Plains.
The agreement notes that assessing AQI
treatment monitoring fees on a per-enclo-
sure basis imposes disproportionate impacts
on industry and user groups at certain key
ports of entry, including ports along the
southeast United States. The agreement en-
courages USDA to conduct a new study that
specifically outlines the actual costs of
treatments, examines the disproportionate
impact the fee has on airports and seaports
in different regions of the U.S., and evalu-
ates alternative and equitable funding mech-
anisms. Such report should also incorporate
due consideration of the recommendations of
the Treatment Fee Working Group’s Sep-
tember 27, 2016 ‘‘Report to APHIS’’. USDA
shall brief the Committees on the status of
such study and other efforts to ensure equi-
table collection of revenues for vital AQI
treatment monitoring efforts no later than
120 days after enactment of this Act.

Some state contracted electronic benefit
transfer (EBT) processors are charging
switching or routing fees in connection with
the routing of SNAP benefits. These fees re-
quire retailers and/or those routing trans-
actions on behalf of retailers (often referred
to as third party processors) to pay for EBT
transaction switching and routing to the
State EBT processor that handles the client
EBT account. In addition, these fees may
seek to offset artificially low cost-per-case-
month fees that are bid as part of State con-
tracts, and therefore adversely affect com-
petition among existing or new EBT Proc-
essors. Therefore, in the interest of main-
taining competitiveness for EBT transaction
routing, Section 750 extends existing statu-
tory prohibitions against the charging of
fees by State contracted EBT processors in
connection with the redemption of USDA do-
mestic food assistance benefits to include
the charging of gateway switching or routing
fees to SNAP authorized retailers or their
third party processors.

support initiatives; $14,000,000 for infrastruc-
ture; and an increase of $25,000,000 for the
contingency reserve.
The work of the National Academies of
Science (NAS) to review and make rec-
ommendations for updating the WIC food
packages to reflect current science and cul-
tural factors is recognized. The agreement
notes, however, that while all revised pack-
ages now allow some fish, the amounts re-
main low compared to the recommendations
of other authoritative health agencies. The
agreement strongly encourages the Depart-
ment to consider the health and cultural
benefits of fish consumption as the NAS rec-
ommendations are reviewed and used to in-
form the Department’s next course of action.
The agreement also strongly encourages the
Department to continue to allow states to
submit cultural food package proposals to
respond to the cultural preferences of WIC
participants in states like Alaska.

The agreement provides $2,800,078,000 in
new discretionary budget authority and
$2,337,963,000 in definite user fees for a total
of $5,138,041,000 for Food and Drug Adminis-
tration, Salaries and Expenses. This total
does not include permanent, indefinite user
fees for the Mammography Quality Stand-
ards Act; Color Certification; Export Certifi-
cation; Priority Review Vouchers Pediatric
Disease; Food and Feed Recall; Food Rein-
spection; Voluntary Qualified Importer Pro-
gram; the Third Party Auditor Program;
Outsourcing Facility; and Medical Counter-
measure Priority Review Vouchers. The
agreement expects the FDA to continue all
projects, activities, laboratories, and pro-
grams as included in fiscal year 2017 unless
otherwise specified.
The agreement includes increases of
$1,000,000 to review botanical drug and die-
tary supplement interactions; $400,000 to sup-
port the Critical Path Initiative; $2,800,000 to
support intramural work and extramural

$1,500,000 for the HHS Office of Inspector
General specifically for oversight of FDA ac-
tivities, and $1,500,000 for consumer edu-
cation and outreach regarding bio-
technology.
The agreement includes a one-time in-
crease of $2,500,000 to assist the agency in ob-
taining information from medical specialists
and medical specialty groups concerning
clinical use of each of the substances nomi-
nated for the list developed by the FDA of
bulk drug substances for which there is a
clinical need (‘‘503B Bulks List’’). Addition-
ally, the agreement directs the FDA to fol-
low congressional intent as it relates to
human drug compounded medicines and the
standards set forth under current Good Man-
ufacturing Practices (CGMP). Given the need
for high quality control and patient safety,
the agency is instructed to prohibit out-
sourcing facilities from compounding drug
products from bulk ingredients when out-
sourcing facilities could otherwise be
compounding from an FDA approved drug
product.
The agreement also includes a general pro-
vision providing $94,000,000 for the FDA to
expand its efforts related to addressing the
opioid crisis. According to the FDA, there is
an increasing trend in the number of deaths
involving fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, being
used in combination with other drugs, in-
cluding cocaine, heroin, and methamphet-
amine. A significant amount of illicit
fentanyl is entering the country as part of
the hundreds of millions of parcels that come
through International Mail Facilities (IMF)
annually. This funding will allow the FDA to
strategically strengthen the agency’s pres-
ence at IMFs to increase its overall oper-
ational capacity to inspect more incoming
packages. Specifically, this funding is for the
FDA to purchase equipment and information

technology to identify unapproved and coun-
terfeit pharmaceuticals, and to upgrade lab-
oratory facilities used in this effort. Addi-
tionally, funding is provided to better iden-
tify and target firms and organizations im-
porting into the United States; increase the
staff inspecting packages and to increase the
number of packages they are inspecting; in-
crease criminal investigation resources; and
increase staff and equipment to efficiently
screen imported products.
Additionally, the agreement encourages
the FDA to continue implementing the
Opioid Action Plan to determine how
changes in opioid packaging, distribution,
and medication disposal procedures can help
mitigate the national opioid crisis, including
working to support ongoing efforts at the
state and regional level.
The agreement notes that the FDA has not
finalized the rule to extend the compliance
date for manufacturers for the Nutrition
Facts Label Final Rule and the Serving Size
Final Rule, which is causing significant con-
fusion and market disruptions, and directs
the agency to finalize the rule before July 26,
2018. Further, the agreement directs the
agency to issue its conclusions on the status
of pending dietary fiber ingredients expedi-
tiously.
The agreement directs the FDA to make
the report on Tobacco Product User Fees de-
scribed in H. Rpt. 115–232 publicly available
on its website within 60 days of enactment of
the Act.
The agreement notes that the FDA initi-
ated studies concerning glass products for
injectable products and directs the FDA to
evaluate the agency’s study data and any
other appropriate available data and report
back to the Committees within 45 days on
whether it plans to update the 2011 Advisory
to reflect recent science.
Concerns remain about the FDA’s ability
to meet its legal obligation to protect trade
secrets and confidential commercial infor-
mation the agency obtains from its regu-
lated industries. FDA is overdue in providing
a detailed description of its systems to en-
sure protection of such information and is
directed to provide this plan within 60 days
of enactment of this Act.
The agreement fully supports the require-
ment for all covered facilities to have food
defense plans but concerns have been raised
that the final rule entitled ‘‘Mitigation
Strategies to Protect Food Against Inten-
tional Adulteration,’’ dated May 27, 2016 (81
Fed. Reg. 34165) is overly prescriptive, costly,
and inconsistent with current successful
practices that have been used to protect the
nation’s food supply. In order to address the
fundamental concerns with the final rule,
the agreement urges the Agency to consider
providing more time for further collabo-
rative dialogue with stakeholders.
BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES
The agreement provides $11,788,000 for the
Food and Drug Administration Buildings and
Facilities.
FDA INNOVATION ACCOUNT, CURES ACT
The agreement provides $60,000,000 for the
FDA as authorized in the 21st Century Cures

COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION
The agreement provides $249,000,000 for the
CFTC, of which $48,000,000 is for the purchase
of information technology and of which
$2,700,000 is for the Office of Inspector Gen-
eral (OIG). Of this amount for OIG, not less
than $350,000 should be for overhead ex-
penses.
The agreement directs the CFTC to sub-
mit, within 30 days of enactment, a detailed
spending plan for the allocation of the funds
made available, displayed by discrete pro-
gram, project, and activity, including staff-
ing projections, specifying both FTEs and
contractors, and planned investments in in-
formation technology.

Report language included in House Report
115–231 (‘‘the House report’’) or Senate Re-
port 115–139 (‘‘the Senate report’’) that is not
changed by this explanatory statement or
this Act is approved. The explanatory state-
ment, while repeating some language for em-
phasis, is not intended to negate the lan-
guage referred to above unless expressly pro-
vided herein. In cases where both the House
report and the Senate report address a par-
ticular issue not specifically addressed in the
explanatory statement, the House report and
the Senate report should be read as con-
sistent and are to be interpreted accordingly.
In cases where the House report or the Sen-
ate report directs the submission of a report,
such report is to be submitted to both the
House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions (‘‘the Committees’’).
Each department and agency funded in this
Act shall follow the directions set forth in
this Act and the accompanying explanatory
statement, and shall not reallocate resources
or reorganize activities except as provided
herein. Reprogramming procedures shall
apply to: funds provided in this Act; unobli-
gated balances from previous appropriations
Acts that are available for obligation or ex-
penditure in fiscal year 2018; and non-appro-
priated resources such as fee collections that
are used to meet program requirements in
fiscal year 2018. These procedures are speci-
fied in section 505 of this Act.
Any reprogramming request shall include
any out-year budgetary impacts and a sepa-
rate accounting of program or mission im-
pacts on estimated carryover funds. Any pro-
gram, project or activity cited in this state-
ment, or in the House report or the Senate
report and not changed by this Act or state-
ment, shall be construed as the position of
the Congress and shall not be subject to re-
ductions or reprogramming without prior ap-
proval of the Committees. Further, any de-
partment or agency funded in this Act that
plans a reduction-in-force shall notify the
Committees by letter no later than 30 days
in advance of the date of any such planned
personnel action.
When a department or agency submits a
reprogramming or transfer request to the
Committees and does not receive identical
responses, it shall be the responsibility of
the department or agency seeking the re-
programming to reconcile the differences be-
tween the two bodies before proceeding. If
reconciliation is not possible, the items in
disagreement in the reprogramming or
transfer request shall be considered unap-
proved. Departments and agencies shall not
submit reprogramming notifications after
July 1, 2018, except in extraordinary cir-
cumstances. Any such notification shall in-
clude a description of the extraordinary cir-
cumstances.
In compliance with section 532 of this Act,
each department and agency funded in this
Act shall submit spending plans, signed by
the respective department or agency head,
for the Committees’ review not later than 45
days after enactment of this Act.
TITLE I
DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
INTERNATIONAL TRADE ADMINISTRATION
OPERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATION
This Act includes $495,000,000 in total re-
sources for the International Trade Adminis-
tration. This amount is offset by $13,000,000
in estimated fee collections, resulting in a
direct appropriation of $482,000,000. The
agreement provides $87,500,000 for Enforce-
ment and Compliance and no less than the
fiscal year 2017 amount for Global Markets.
The agreement adopts the Senate report lan-
guage regarding SelectUSA.
BUREAU OF INDUSTRY AND SECURITY
OPERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATION
This Act includes $113,500,000 for the Bu-
reau of Industry and Security.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION
This Act includes $301,500,000 for the pro-
grams and administrative expenses of the
Economic Development Administration
(EDA). Section 523 of this Act includes a re-
scission of $10,000,000 in Economic Develop-
ment Assistance Program balances. The
funds shall be derived from recoveries and
unobligated grant funds that were not appro-
priated with emergency or disaster relief
designations.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE
PROGRAMS
This Act includes $262,500,000 for Economic
Development Assistance Programs. Funds
are to be distributed as follows; any devi-
ation of funds shall be subject to the proce-
dures set forth in section 505 of this Act:

Job Losses from Nuclear Power Plant Clo-
sures.—As noted in Senate Report 114–239, re-
cent closures of nuclear power plants
throughout the United States have had a
negative impact on the economic founda-
tions of surrounding communities, and there
is potential for additional plant closures in
the coming years. EDA can serve an integral
role in assisting communities as nuclear
plant closures affect the economic landscape
of surrounding areas. To that end, EDA is di-
rected to report to the Committees within 90
days of enactment of this Act on its work to
help identify and develop best practices to
assist communities affected by loss of tax
revenue and job loss due to nuclear power
plant closures.
Broadband projects.—EDA funding pro-
vided under Public Works, Economic Adjust-
ment Assistance, and other programs may be
used to support broadband infrastructure
projects. High speed broadband is critical to
help communities attract new industries and
strengthen and grow local economies. EDA is
encouraged to prioritize unserved areas. EDA
shall submit a report to the Committees
within 30 days of the end of fiscal year 2018
describing the number and value of
broadband projects supported with fiscal
year 2018 funds.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
This Act includes $39,000,000 for EDA sala-
ries and expenses.
Minority Business Development Agency
MINORITY BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
This Act includes $39,000,000 for the Minor-
ity Business Development Agency (MBDA).
In lieu of House language regarding external
funding, the agreement directs that not less
than 50 percent of funds provided to MBDA
shall be awarded through competitive agree-
ments, external awards, and grants.
ECONOMIC AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
This Act includes $99,000,000 for Economic
and Statistical Analysis. The agreement
does not adopt the proposed reorganization
of the Economics and Statistics Administra-
tion (ESA). Senate report language is adopt-
ed by reference.
BUREAU OF THE CENSUS
This Act includes $2,814,000,000 for the Bu-
reau of the Census.
CURRENT SURVEYS AND PROGRAMS
This Act includes $270,000,000 for the Cur-
rent Surveys and Programs account of the
Bureau of the Census.
PERIODIC CENSUSES AND PROGRAMS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
This Act includes $2,544,000,000 for the Peri-
odic Censuses and Programs account of the
Bureau of the Census.
In October 2017, the Secretary of Com-
merce delivered a new life-cycle cost esti-
mate for the 2020 Decennial Census totaling
$15,625,000,000. In addition to reliance on a
new, independent cost estimate (ICE), the
Secretary’s estimate includes additional as-
sumptions to enhance the robustness and re-
liability of the program. For example, the
new estimate assumes the need for addi-
tional in-person follow-up visits due to fewer
households initially responding to the Cen-
sus. The Secretary also requested a funding
contingency to address any problems not an-
ticipated by the ICE.
Approximately 70 percent of the costs of
the 2020 Census will be incurred in fiscal year
2019 and fiscal year 2020. In order to ensure
Census has the necessary resources to imme-
diately address any issues discovered during
the 2018 End-To-End Test, and to provide a
smoother transition between fiscal year 2018
and fiscal year 2019, this agreement provides
half of the amount needed for the 2020 Census
for those fiscal years and includes the 2018
contingency amount of $50,000,000 requested
by the Secretary. These resources will also
allow the Bureau of the Census to move for-
ward with the timely execution of its 2020
Decennial Census communications and part-
nerships program to improve response rates
and enhance trust in the Census. The Census
Bureau is directed to ensure that its fiscal
year 2018 partnership and communications
activities in support of the 2020 Census are
conducted at a level of effort and staffing no
less than that conducted during fiscal year
2008 in preparation for the 2010 Decennial
Census. The Census Bureau is further di-
rected to provide the Committees with noti-
fication 15 days before any spending it in-
tends to incur in fiscal year 2018 that is
above the amounts included in the October
2017 life-cycle cost estimate for fiscal year
2018.
The agreement modifies House and Senate
language requiring the Census Bureau to fur-
nish certain information to the Committees
and the Government Accountability Office
(GAO). The Census Bureau shall provide this
information no later than 60 days after en-
actment of this Act. Additionally, the Cen-
sus Bureau shall include information on the
number of open information technology (IT)
security plans of actions and milestones for
all 2020 Census systems and infrastructure,
categorized by whether the underlying weak-
ness or vulnerability is considered critical,
high, moderate, or low risk, including a list
of those plans of actions and milestones that
are not scheduled to be closed within six
months.
NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND
INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
This Act includes $39,500,000 for the sala-
ries and expenses of the National Tele-
communications and Information Adminis-
tration (NTIA).

Broadband.—The agreement provides
$7,500,000 to update the national broadband
availability map in coordination with the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC),
which updated its map in February 2018
using Form 477 filing data. The funding pro-
vided does not constitute a new program to
fund the primary data collection of
broadband availability or subscription data,
nor is it for funding specific data collection
activities by States or third parties. Instead,
NTIA should use this funding to acquire and
display available third-party data sets to the
extent it is able to negotiate its inclusion in
existing efforts to augment data from the
FCC, other Federal government agencies,
State government, and the private sector.
NTIA shall not duplicate FCC’s efforts. The
updated map will help identify regions with
insufficient service, especially in rural areas.
First Responder Network Authority
(FirstNet).—NTIA is encouraged to place
equal priority on the rural deployment of the
Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Net-
work to that of urban communities.
UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK
OFFICE
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
This Act includes language making avail-
able to the United States Patent and Trade-
mark Office (USPTO) $3,500,000,000, the full
amount of offsetting fee collections esti-
mated for fiscal year 2018 by the Congres-
sional Budget Office.
Asset Disposals.—The agreement notes
that the Patent and Trademark Office, like
all of the Department of Commerce, is sub-
ject to the asset disposal notifications in sec-
tion 103, requiring agencies to provide at
least 15 days advance notice of the disposal
of any capital asset not specifically provided
for in this Act or other law appropriating
funds for the Department of Commerce. As
this Act provides for no disposals, the Patent
and Trademark Office shall inform the Com-
mittees of any capital asset disposal that
meets the definition established in section
103.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND
TECHNOLOGY
This Act includes $1,198,500,000 for the Na-
tional Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST).
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL RESEARCH AND
SERVICES
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
This Act provides $724,500,000 for NIST’s
Scientific and Technical Research and Serv-
ices (STRS) account. The agreement rejects
the proposed terminations and reductions for
all STRS programs and provides not less
than fiscal year 2017 funding for: Advanced
Networks, Connected Systems, and Data
Science; Advanced Materials Manufacturing;
Biological Science and Health Measure-
ments; Corporate Services; Environmental
Measurements; the Office of Special Pro-
grams; Quantum Science; Resilience and
Structural Engineering; Semiconductor and
Microelectronic Measurements; Standards
Coordination Office; Time and Fundamental
Measurement Dissemination; and User Fa-
cilities. The Senate report language regard-
ing cybersecurity and the National Cyberse-
curity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) is
adopted by reference and NCCoE is provided
not less than $33,000,000. Additionally, the
agreement adopts Senate report language re-
garding forensic sciences.
Disaster Resilient Buildings.—Senate lan-
guage regarding disaster resilient buildings
is not adopted. Instead, within funding pro-
vided for Disaster Resilient Buildings, NIST
is directed to provide no less than $5,000,000
for competitive external awards. NIST shall
be responsive to all grant applicants, includ-
ing acknowledging receipt of applications,
providing feedback to any unsuccessful ap-
plicants who request further information,
and giving adequate notice of the timeline
for announcing awards.
Nano-structured materials.—The agree-
ment modifies House language regarding
nano-structured materials to specify that
the report shall be due no later than six
months after enactment of this Act.
INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY SERVICES
This Act includes $155,000,000 in total for
Industrial Technology Services, including
$140,000,000 for the Hollings Manufacturing
Extension Partnership and $15,000,000 for the
National Network for Manufacturing Innova-
tion, to include funding for center establish-
ment and up to $5,000,000 for coordination ac-
tivities.
Manufacturing USA Coordination.—The
agreement provides no more than $5,000,000
for NIST’s coordination role for all Manufac-
turing USA institutes across the Federal
government. This amount equals NIST’s fis-
cal year 2018 request for this activity. Not
later than 60 days after enactment of this
Act, NIST shall provide the Committees a re-
port detailing the funding breakout for co-
ordination activities for Manufacturing USA
for the last three fiscal years. The report
shall address how coordination funding is
separate from direct funding provided for
Manufacturing USA institutes, or whether
there is any overlap.
CONSTRUCTION OF RESEARCH FACILITIES
This Act includes $319,000,000 for Construc-
tion of Research Facilities.
NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC
ADMINISTRATION
OPERATIONS, RESEARCH, AND FACILITIES
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
This Act includes a total program level of
$3,697,831,000 under this account for the
coastal, fisheries, marine, weather, satellite
and other programs of the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
This total funding level includes
$3,536,331,000 in direct appropriations; a
transfer of $144,000,000 from balances in the
‘‘Promote and Develop Fishery Products and
Research Pertaining to American Fisheries’’
fund; and $17,500,000 derived from recoveries
of prior year obligations.
The agreement does not include section 553
of the House bill regarding the National
Ocean Policy. No funding was provided in fis-
cal year 2017, and none was requested by any
agencies funded in this Act in fiscal year
2018, to implement the National Ocean Pol-
icy. Consequently, no funds for National
Ocean Policy activities are included for any
agency funded in this Act.
Weather Research and Forecasting Innova-
tion Act of 2017.—This agreement is con-
sistent with Public Law 115–25, the Weather
Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of
2017. Funding is provided for NOAA to im-
prove weather data, modeling, computing,
forecast infrastructure, and warnings to
allow the agency to develop more accurate,
timely, and effective warnings and forecasts
of weather events that endanger life and
property.
The following narrative descriptions and
tables identify the specific activities and
funding levels included in this Act.

Resilience Grants, the agreement provides
$30,000,000 for Title IX Fund grants to meet
the goals of the Regional Coastal Resilience
Grants, as authorized under section 906(c) of
Title IX of Public Law 114–113. NOAA shall
administer this program in accordance with
16 U.S.C. 7505(b) and 3701, for collaborative
partnerships that incorporate non-Federal
matching funds with a priority on sup-
porting authorized activities not otherwise
funded within this Act, and direct costs shall
not exceed 5 percent. NOAA shall retain
oversight and accounting of this funding.
Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs).—The agree-
ment provides additional funding for NOAA
to address HABs, and House and Senate lan-
guage is adopted in full regarding concern
for the impacts of harmful algal blooms and

Northeast Multispecies Fishery.—The Sen-
ate language pertaining to the Northeast
Multispecies Fishery is adopted. In lieu of
Section 537 of the Senate bill, the agreement
provides an additional $10,300,000 within Ob-
servers and Training to fully fund the cost of
At-Sea Monitors in the New England ground-
fish fishery, including sea and shore side in-
frastructure costs. NOAA’s current assess-
ment is that $20,000,000 covers Standardized
Bycatch Reporting Methodology require-
ments, and NOAA believes that up to
$2,500,000 is needed to fully fund the At-Sea
Monitoring costs, for a total of $22,500,000,
which is provided. NOAA is directed to fully
fund the At-Sea Monitoring costs. It is noted
that NOAA has estimated the additional
costs of fully funding these activities to be
anywhere from $850,000 to $10,300,000. That
variation in range is unacceptable. The
spending plan submitted under section 505 of
this Act shall include a final amount needed
to fully fund At-Sea Monitoring.
Fishery Science Centers.—The agreement
does not include section 548 of the House bill
regarding the relocation of NOAA fishery
science centers. No funding was requested,
and no funding is provided in this Act to per-
manently relocate any such centers during
fiscal year 2018.
Gulf of Mexico Red Snapper.—House and
Senate language regarding red snapper as-
sessments in the Gulf of Mexico is adopted,
and up to $10,000,000 within Fisheries Data
Collections, Surveys and Assessments shall
be available for carrying out such purposes.
Pacific Salmon Treaty.—The agreement
adopts the Senate recommended funding
level to continue negotiations and imple-
ment necessary Pacific Salmon Treaty
agreements.
Fishery Management Council Fund Re-
port.—The agreement expands the reporting
requirement in the Senate report to include
all Fishery Management Councils. NOAA
shall work with the Committees and the
Councils to establish the appropriate scope
and format for this report.
Atlantic Striped Bass.—The Atlantic
States Marine Fishery Commission is com-
pleting a new stock assessment of Atlantic
Striped Bass in 2018. After this assessment is
complete, the Secretary of Commerce is di-
rected to use this assessment to review the
Federal moratorium on Atlantic Striped
Bass.
Block Island Transit Zone.—NOAA, in con-
sultation with the Atlantic States Marine
Fisheries Commission, is directed to con-
sider lifting the ban on striped bass fishing
in the Federal Block Island Transit Zone.
Illegal, Unregulated, and Unreported (IUU)
Fishing.—The agreement adopts Senate lan-
guage regarding IUU fishing, and provides an
additional $1,200,000 under Fisheries Manage-
ment Programs and Services to implement
the program described in section 539 of this
Act.
Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Re-
search (OAR).—$507,519,000 is for OAR Oper-
ations, Research, and Facilities.

Quarterly Briefings.—Continuous reports
of management and staffing challenges
across the NWS are unacceptable. NOAA and
the Department of Commerce are directed to
ensure that the NWS fulfills its critical mis-
sion to protect the lives and property of our
nation’s citizens. The agreement adopts Sen-
ate language regarding NWS vacancies and
the fiscal year 2018 spend plan, but clarifies
that this plan should distinguish between
funded and unfunded vacancies. Addition-
ally, NOAA shall provide quarterly briefings
to the Committees on all NWS management
and budget issues, to include: a list of funded
vacancies, by type and location, including
the length of time the positions have been
vacant; the Program, Project, or Activity
(PPA) from which each vacancy is funded,
and the plan for addressing each vacancy; an
update on the implementation of the Oper-
ations and Workforce Analysis; budget exe-
cution by PPA; major procurements; and
other topics as appropriate. Additionally, in
the fiscal year 2020 President’s Budget sub-
mission for NWS, the Department of Com-
merce shall document the funded position
vacancy rate and lapse assumptions built
into the budget request by PPA.
Hydrology and Water Resource Pro-
grams.—In addition to Senate language re-
garding the National Water Center, and in
lieu of Senate language under OAR, the
agreement provides an additional $6,000,000
for NWS, in coordination with OAR, to col-
laborate with external academic partners to
improve fine and large-scale measurements
of snow depth and soil moisture data that
can be used to expand and improve the Na-
tional Water Model and contribute directly
to the mission of NOAA’s National Water
Center. The agreement reiterates Senate
language recognizing the success of research-
to-operations efforts and external partner-
ships.
Facilities Maintenance.—The agreement
provides $16,000,000 for the National Weather
Service’s highest priority facilities repair
and deferred maintenance requirements at
Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs). NWS has
nearly completed its nationwide facilities
condition assessment, and has a comprehen-
sive analysis of conditions, itemized deferred
maintenance list, and projected lifecycle
costs for NOAA’s network of WFOs. There is
concern that current conditions and deferred
maintenance items include issues that may
significantly affect operational readiness,
service delivery, or occupant safety. Thirty
days prior to obligating any of these addi-
tional facilities repair and deferred mainte-
nance funds, NWS shall submit a report pro-
viding the following information: (1) a
prioritized list of NWS deferred facilities
maintenance needs, based on the facilities
condition assessment, including an expla-
nation of how such list was prioritized; (2) an
estimate of the total amount and composi-
tion of deferred facilities maintenance, in-
cluding an explanation of how such estimate
was developed; and (3) an explanation of how
NWS maintains information on, and man-
ages, its deferred maintenance needs and ac-

an excessively lengthy wait and ruled on all
petitions for remission or mitigation that
were referred to the Department before June
26, 2017. The Committees note that these pe-
titions are imperative in returning money

the Act provides additional funding for dep-
uty U.S. marshals to meet the growing work-

tion and related expenses in space con-
trolled, occupied or utilized by the USMS for
prisoner holding and related support. The
USMS is expected to apply this funding to
its top ten priority projects.

nized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task
Forces, of which $375,000,000 is for investiga-
tions and $167,850,000 is for prosecutions. The

drug trafficking organizations with a focus
on reducing the availability of opioids.
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
This Act includes $9,030,202,000 for the sala-
ries and expenses of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), including $1,740,000,000
for Intelligence, $3,660,200,000 for Counterter-
rorism and Counterintelligence, $3,090,000,000
for Criminal Enterprises and Federal Crimes,
and $540,000,000 for Criminal Justice Serv-
ices.
Within funding provided, the FBI is ex-
pected to enhance its investigative and intel-
ligence efforts related to terrorism, national
security, and cyber threats, to include
strengthening the Cyber Division. Also with-
in the level of funding provided, the FBI
shall ensure that the National Instant Crimi-
nal Background Check System (NICS) oper-
ations more adequately address background
check demand and improve NICS perform-
ance, including enhancing system avail-
ability, determination rates, and E-Check
services. DOJ is also directed to consult with
and provide technical guidance to help other
Federal departments and agencies fulfill
their obligation to submit all relevant
records into the NICS database.
Communication and information sharing.—
The FBI is directed to review protocols asso-
ciated with communication and information
sharing between the Public Access Line and
FBI field offices, and to report to the Com-
mittees within 60 days of enactment of this
Act on potential improvements.
Law enforcement medical demonstra-
tion.—Within 60 days of enactment of this
Act, the FBI shall update the Committees on
efforts to formalize its existing external
partnership with a civilian academic medical
center, including the FBI’s use of medical
communications systems and Level I trauma
centers to support contingency planning and
improve the delivery of medical care for high
risk law enforcement missions.
Canine Weapons of Mass Destruction Di-
rectorate (WMDD) research.—The agreement
adopts Senate report language regarding the
Hazardous Devices School, which supports
the Bureau’s WMDD detector canine pro-
gram. The Act clarifies that funding direc-
tion for these canine activities shall be at a
level above fiscal year 2017 that adequately
supports the operations and ongoing develop-
ment of this program.
Countering election-related threats.—
Within the increased funding provided, the
FBI is directed to make the counterintel-
ligence and cyber-related investments nec-
essary to help respond to foreign actors, in-
cluding those seeking to compromise demo-
cratic institutions and processes. It is ex-
pected that the FBI will invest in initiatives
that will assist in enhanced source develop-
ment, deployment of additional surveillance
assets, implementation of other sophisti-
cated targeting techniques, or other inves-
tigative activities deemed necessary to
thwart foreign actors. These investments
will also aid the FBI in carrying out its roles
and responsibilities pursuant to the January
2017 designation of election infrastructure as
part of the nation’s critical infrastructure,
thereby facilitating enhanced information
sharing between the Federal government and
State and local election officials responsible
for running Federal elections in this coun-
try. The FBI shall brief the Committees not
later than 90 days after the date of enact-
ment of this Act on its plans to carry out
these initiatives.

vided, the FBI is expected to increase re-
sources devoted to human trafficking inves-
tigations.
CONSTRUCTION
This Act includes $370,000,000 for FBI con-
struction, which supports the Senate’s lan-
guage on 21st Century Facilities and pro-
vides additional funding above the requested

ities outside of the immediate national cap-
ital area.
FBI Headquarters.—The Act does not in-
clude funding for the revised Headquarters
consolidation plan released on February 12,
2018, because many questions regarding the
new plan remain unanswered, including the
revision of longstanding security require-
ments and changes to headquarters capacity
in the national capital region. Until these
concerns are addressed and the appropriate
authorizing Committees approve a pro-
spectus, the Committees are reluctant to ap-
propriate additional funds for this activity.
DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
This Act includes a direct appropriation of
$2,190,326,000 for the salaries and expenses of
the Drug Enforcement Administration

meet the rising threats from heroin,
fentanyl, and other opioids, additional fund-
ing is included to: expand opioid and heroin
enforcement efforts, including supporting ex-
isting heroin enforcement teams and estab-
lishing new ones; invest in the Fentanyl Sig-

ligations from the Crime Victims Fund of
$4,436,000,000 as stipulated in section 510 of
this Act.

Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery
Act (CARA) programs.—The agreement pro-
vides a total of $330,000,000 for DOJ’s CARA
programs, an increase of $227,000,000 above
the fiscal year 2017 level, including
$132,000,000 above the fiscal year 2017 level for
the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Program
(COAP). It is expected that the Bureau of
Justice Assistance will not only be able to
make additional site-based program awards
under the existing COAP structure, but will
be able to expand COAP offerings to include
prevention and education programs for
youth, community engagement by law en-
forcement, response teams to assist children
dealing with the aftermath of opioid addic-
tion, and family court programming relating
to treatment for opioids. Senate report lan-
guage on the Law Enforcement Assisted Di-
version (LEAD) model is adopted.
NICS Initiative grants.—While the agree-
ment includes a $2,000,000 increase for the
NICS Initiative grant program, the Commit-
tees remain deeply concerned over problem-
atic applications from States for the Na-
tional Criminal History Improvement Pro-
gram (NCHIP) and NICS Act Record Im-
provement Program (NARIP) grants, which
result in fewer grants being awarded than
were funded by appropriations. Over the past
several fiscal years, far too many proposals
from States have been out-of-scope, of poor
quality, or requested excessive funding to re-
place an entire criminal justice records sys-
tem, leading DOJ to exclude them. The Of-
fice of Justice Programs (OJP) is directed to
consult with State and tribal governments
to provide training and technical assistance
in completing a successful application for
both of these grant programs, including ex-
pressly outlining what is in scope for project
needs, information technology, and cost.
Victims of Trafficking grants.—The agree-
ment provides $77,000,000 for the Victims of
Trafficking Grant program, as authorized by
Public Law 106–386 and amended by Public
Law 113–4, of which no less than $22,000,000 is
for the Enhanced Collaborative Model to
Combat Human Trafficking Task Force Pro-
gram. This funding level also includes
$10,000,000 for the Minor Victims of Traf-
ficking Grant program, of which $8,000,000 is
for victim services grants for sex-trafficked
minors as authorized by Public Law 113–4,
with the remaining $2,000,000 for victim serv-
ices grants for labor-trafficked minors. The
Committees encourage DOJ to work in close
coordination with the Department of Health
and Human Services to facilitate collabora-
tion and reduce duplication of efforts.
Capital Litigation Improvement and
Wrongful Conviction Review Grant pro-
grams.—The Committees direct that at least
50 percent of the $3,000,000 appropriated to
the Capital Litigation Improvement and
Wrongful Conviction Review grant programs
be used to support entities that represent in-
dividuals with post-conviction claims of in-
nocence and provide legal representation;
case review, evaluation, and management;
experts; and investigation services related to
these innocence claims.
Paul Coverdell Forensic Science.—The
alarming proliferation of heroin and syn-
thetic drugs like fentanyl have had a crush-
ing effect on State crime labs, resulting in a
significant increase in the backlog. Syn-
thetics in particular take much longer to
analyze than traditional drugs and chemi-
cals. Medical examiners and pathologists
have also been overwhelmed with the volume
of autopsies as a result of heroin and syn-
thetic drug-related overdose deaths. The rec-
ommendation provides an additional
$17,000,000 for the Coverdell program to spe-
cifically target the challenges the opioid epi-
demic has brought to the forensics commu-
nity.

DIVISION C—DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018
The following is an explanation of the ef-
fects of this Act, which makes appropria-
tions for the Department of Defense for fis-
cal year 2018. The joint explanatory state-
ment accompanying this division is approved
and indicates congressional intent. Unless
otherwise noted, the language set forth in
House Report 115–219 warrants full compli-
ance and carries the same weight as lan-
guage included in this joint explanatory
statement unless specifically addressed to
the contrary in the bill or this joint explana-
tory statement. While some language is re-
peated for emphasis, this explanatory state-
ment does not intend to negate the language
referred to above unless expressly provided
herein.
DEFINITION OF PROGRAM, PROJECT, AND
ACTIVITY
For the purposes of the Balanced Budget
and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985
(Public Law 99–177), as amended by the Bal-
anced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control
Reaffirmation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100–
119), and by the Budget Enforcement Act of
1990 (Public Law 101–508), the terms ‘‘pro-
gram, project, and activity’’ for appropria-
tions contained in this Act shall be defined
as the most specific level of budget items
identified in the Department of Defense Ap-
propriations Act, 2018, the related classified
annexes and explanatory statements, and the
P–1 and R–1 budget justification documents
as subsequently modified by congressional
action.
The following exception to the above defi-
nition shall apply: the military personnel
and the operation and maintenance ac-
counts, for which the term ‘‘program,
project, and activity’’ is defined as the ap-
propriations accounts contained in the De-
partment of Defense Appropriations Act.
At the time the President submits the
budget request for fiscal year 2019, the Sec-
retary of Defense is directed to transmit to
the congressional defense committees budget
justification documents to be known as the
‘‘M–1’’ and the ‘‘O–1’’ which shall identify, at
the budget activity, activity group, and sub-
activity group level, the amounts requested
by the President to be appropriated to the
Department of Defense for military per-
sonnel and operation and maintenance in
any budget request, or amended budget re-
quest, for fiscal year 2019.
REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE
The Secretary of Defense is directed to
continue to follow the reprogramming guid-
ance for acquisition accounts as specified in
the report accompanying the House version
of the Department of Defense Appropriations
bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110–
279). The dollar threshold for reprogramming
funds shall be $10,000,000 for military per-
sonnel; $20,000,000 for operation and mainte-
nance; $20,000,000 for procurement; and
$10,000,000 for research, development, test
and evaluation.
Also, the Under Secretary of Defense
(Comptroller) is directed to continue to pro-
vide the congressional defense committees
annual DD Form 1416 reports for titles I and
II and quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form
1416 reports for Service and defense-wide ac-
counts in titles III and IV of this Act. Re-
ports for titles III and IV shall comply with
guidance specified in the explanatory state-
ment accompanying the Department of De-
fense Appropriations Act, 2006. The Depart-
ment shall continue to follow the limitation
that prior approval reprogrammings are set
at either the specified dollar threshold or 20
percent of the procurement or research, de-
velopment, test and evaluation line, which-
ever is less. These thresholds are cumulative
from the base for reprogramming value as
modified by any adjustments. Therefore, if
the combined value of transfers into or out
of a military personnel (M–1), an operation
and maintenance (O–1), a procurement (P–1),
or a research, development, test and evalua-
tion (R–1) line exceeds the identified thresh-
old, the Secretary of Defense must submit a
prior approval reprogramming to the con-
gressional defense committees. In addition,
guidelines on the application of prior ap-
proval reprogramming procedures for con-
gressional special interest items are estab-
lished elsewhere in this statement.
FUNDING INCREASES
The funding increases outlined in the ta-
bles for each appropriation account shall be
provided only for the specific purposes indi-
cated in the tables.
CONGRESSIONAL SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS
Items for which additional funds have been
provided or items for which funding is spe-
cifically reduced as shown in the project
level tables or in paragraphs using the
phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ are congres-
sional special interest items for the purpose
of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form
1414). Each of these items must be carried on
the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount, as
specifically addressed in the explanatory
statement.
CLASSIFIED ANNEX
Adjustments to classified programs are ad-
dressed in the accompanying classified
annex.
SERVICE UNFUNDED REQUIREMENTS LISTS
The House and Senate Defense Appropria-
tions Subcommittees recognize that each
military Service submits an annual unfunded
requirements list to the congressional de-
fense committees that provides insight into
requirements that may have been excluded
from the budget request due to budgetary
constraints. However, the lists are often di-
vided into various categories of items, there-
by obscuring the true prioritization of the
requests. The Chiefs of Staff of the Army and
the Air Force, the Chief of Naval Operations,
and the Commandant of the Marine Corps
are directed to provide their individual Serv-
ice unfunded requirements in consolidated
priority lists for future budget submissions.
RAPID ACQUISITION AUTHORITY
The Secretary of Defense or his designee,
in conjunction with the Under Secretary of
Defense (Comptroller), is directed to provide
to the congressional defense committees, not
later than 5 days following notification of
the Secretary’s intent to execute or previous
application of Rapid Acquisition Authority
(RAA), the following: the documented re-
quirement intended to be addressed by use of
RAA; the Service or defense agency charged
with implementing the material solution
identified; the identification of funds af-
fected by the use of RAA by appropriations
account, line, and/or program element, to in-
clude outyear funding requirements by fiscal
year; an explanation as to why source funds
are available to fund this higher priority
item; and details of, and justification for, the
contract type or other transaction authority
being utilized.
In addition, the Under Secretary of De-
fense (Comptroller) is directed to provide to
the congressional defense committees a com-
plete accounting of the use of RAA by fiscal
year not later than 30 days after the end of
each fiscal year. The Under Secretary of De-
fense (Comptroller) is further directed to
provide guidance to the Services and defense
agencies to appropriately identify previously
received RAA funds and items funded in
budget exhibits and briefings provided to the
congressional defense committees in support
of Department of Defense budget requests
and, where appropriate, to update the Finan-
cial Management Regulation to that effect.
Finally, it is noted that funds for RAA ini-
tiatives often are executed in place within
the program identified as the funding source
regardless of the original purpose for which
funds were appropriated or the urgent re-
quirement being addressed, and without any
apportionment documents being generated.
The Under Secretary of Defense (Comp-
troller) is directed to provide a briefing on
the impact of RAA funding mechanisms on
Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness
efforts to the congressional defense commit-
tees not later than 60 days after the enact-
ment of this Act.
BUDGETING FOR THE JOINT IMPROVISED–THREAT
DEFEAT ORGANIZATION
The fiscal year 2018 budget request in-
cludes $14,442,000 in base appropriations and
$483,058,000 in overseas contingency oper-
ations appropriations for the Joint Impro-
vised-Threat Defeat Organization (JIDO) in
the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Fund
(JITDF). In addition, the fiscal year 2018
budget request includes $97,788,000 in the Op-
eration and Maintenance, Defense-Wide base
appropriation for the JIDO, reflecting the
transition of the activities, functions, and
resources of the Joint Improvised-Threat De-
feat Agency (JIDA) to the JIDO under the
authority, direction, and control of the De-
fense Threat Reduction Agency, as directed
by Congress and implemented as of Sep-
tember 30, 2016.
The agreement includes no funds in base or
overseas contingency operations appropria-
tions in the JITDF. Instead, funding for the
JIDO is recommended in the Operation and
Maintenance, Defense-Wide; Procurement,
Defense-Wide; and Research, Development,
Test and Evaluation, Defense-Wide overseas
contingency operations appropriations ac-
counts only for the purpose of allowing the
Director of JIDO to investigate, develop, and
provide equipment, supplies, services, train-
ing, facilities, personnel, and funds to assist
United States forces in the defeat of impro-
vised explosive devices in accordance with
JIDO’s fiscal year 2018 budget execution
plans, as subsequently adjusted.
The Director, Office of Management and
Budget, Under Secretary of Defense (Comp-
troller), and Director, Cost Assessment and
Program Evaluation are directed to assist
the Director, Defense Threat Reduction
Agency and Director, JIDO to ensure a seam-
less transition of funding for JIDO from the
JITDF to regular appropriation accounts in
fiscal year 2018 without negatively impacting
the mission of JIDO. Funds still available in
the JITDF and its predecessor account, the
Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat
Fund (JIEDDF) remain available for execu-
tion consistent with prior year guidance. It
is expected that the JITDF and JIEDDF will
be terminated once those balances liquidate
or expire, whichever comes first.
CYBERSPACE ACTIVITIES
The Under Secretary of Defense (Comp-
troller), the Department of Defense Chief In-
formation Officer, and the Service Secre-
taries are directed, with the fiscal year 2020
budget submission, to initiate the establish-
ment of individual cyberspace activity
projects for research, development, test and
evaluation accounts; individual cyberspace
activity sub-activity groups for operation
and maintenance accounts; and individual
budget line items for procurement accounts.
Funds that cross capability lines and are
more appropriately documented within non-
cyberspace activity projects, sub-activity
groups, and line items may continue to be
reported as such, but should include specific

referenced in any cyberspace justification
materials. Such inclusion of cyber activities
in non-cyber projects, sub-activity groups,
and line items shall be carried out in the
most limited manner as possible to meet
congressional intent.
Funding appropriated for cyberspace ac-
tivities as defined by the classified cyber-
space activities information technology in-
vestment budget request for fiscal year 2018
may only be used for such activities. The
Secretary of Defense is directed to use nor-
mal prior approval reprogramming proce-
dures to obligate funding appropriated to the
operation and maintenance; procurement; or
research, development, test and evaluation
accounts for cyberspace activities for any
other purpose. The Chief Information Officer
is directed to submit to the House and Sen-
ate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees
two reports not later than May 30, 2018, and
November 30, 2018, that provide the mid-year
and end of fiscal year financial obligation
and execution data for cyberspace activities
for the previous and current fiscal years.

retary of Defense is prohibited from exe-
cuting any reprogramming or transfer of

military personnel accounts between budget
activities in excess of $10,000,000.
MILITARY PERSONNEL SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS
Items for which additional funds have been
provided or have been specifically reduced as

gressional special interest items for the pur-
pose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD
Form 1414). Each of these items must be car-
ried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated

REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR OPERATION
AND MAINTENANCE ACCOUNTS
The Secretary of Defense is directed to
submit the Base for Reprogramming (DD
Form 1414) for each of the fiscal year 2018 ap-
propriation accounts not later than 60 days
after the enactment of this Act. The Sec-
retary of Defense is prohibited from exe-
cuting any reprogramming or transfer of
funds for any purpose other than originally
appropriated until the aforementioned re-
port is submitted to the House and Senate
Defense Appropriations Subcommittees.
The Secretary of Defense is directed to use
the normal prior approval reprogramming
procedures to transfer funds in the Services’
operation and maintenance accounts be-
tween O–1 budget activities, or between sub-
activity groups in the case of Operation and
Maintenance, Defense-Wide, in excess of
$20,000,000.
The agreement establishes new reprogram-
ming rules for transferring funding out of
readiness sub-activity groups, which are de-
fined as follows:
Army:
Maneuver units
Modular support brigades
Aviation assets
Land forces operations support
Force readiness operations support
Land forces depot maintenance
Base operations support
Facilities sustainment, restoration, and
modernization
Specialized skill training
Navy:
Mission and other flight operations
Fleet air training
Aircraft depot maintenance
Mission and other ship operations
Ship depot maintenance
Facilities sustainment, restoration, and
modernization
Marine Corps:
Operational forces
Field logistics
Depot maintenance
Facilities sustainment, restoration, and
modernization
Air Force:
Primary combat forces
Combat enhancement forces
Depot maintenance
Facilities sustainment, restoration, and
modernization
Contractor logistics support and system
support
Flying hour program
Air Force Reserve:
Depot maintenance
Air National Guard:
Depot maintenance
During fiscal year 2018, the Service Secre-
taries are directed to submit written notifi-
cation to the congressional defense commit-
tees not later than 30 days prior to imple-
menting transfers in excess of $20,000,000 out
of any readiness sub-activity if the funds will
be transferred into another readiness sub-ac-
tivity. However, if funding is transferred out
of any readiness sub-activity into a non-
readiness sub-activity, the Secretary of De-
fense is directed to use normal prior ap-
proval reprogramming procedures.
The Service Secretaries are further di-
rected to include an enclosure with each
written notification that includes increases
and decreases by sub-activity group, a de-
tailed justification explaining why the
sources of funding are available and why the
increases are necessary, and an explanation
of the impact on resources included in the
fiscal year 2019 budget request for each in-
crease and decrease. All transfers may be im-
plemented 30 days after congressional notifi-
cation unless an objection is received from
one of the congressional defense committees.
Additionally, the Secretary of Defense is
directed to use normal prior approval re-
programming procedures when implementing
transfers in excess of $20,000,000 into the fol-
lowing budget sub-activities:
Operation and Maintenance, Army:
Other personnel support/recruiting and ad-
vertising
Operation and Maintenance, Army Na-
tional Guard:
Other personnel support/recruiting and ad-
vertising
This language replaces the language in-
cluded under the heading ‘‘Reprogramming
Guidance for Operation and Maintenance Ac-
counts’’ in House Report 115–219.
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE SPECIAL
INTEREST ITEMS
Items for which additional funds have been
provided or have been specifically reduced as
shown in the project level tables or in para-
graphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only
to’’ in the explanatory statement are con-
gressional special interest items for the pur-
pose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD
Form 1414). Each of these items must be car-
ried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated
amount as specifically addressed in the ex-
planatory statement. Below Threshold
Reprogrammings may not be used to either
restore or reduce funding from congressional
special interest items as identified on the DD
Form 1414.
RESTORING READINESS
The agreement provides additional readi-
ness funds for the Services within the oper-
ation and maintenance accounts. This fund-
ing shall be used only to improve military
readiness, including increased training,
depot maintenance, and base operations sup-
port. None of the funding provided may be
used for recruiting, marketing, or adver-
tising programs. The readiness funding pro-
vided is a congressional special interest
item. The Secretary of Defense and the Serv-
ice Secretaries are directed to submit a de-
tailed spend plan by sub-activity group to
the House and Senate Defense Appropria-
tions Subcommittees not less than 30 days
prior to the obligation of these funds. These
transfers may be implemented 30 days after
congressional notification unless an objec-
tion is received from either the House or
Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommit-
tees.
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE FLEXIBILITY
The agreement includes two adjustments
for fiscal year 2018 to provide more flexi-
bility of funding within the operation and
maintenance accounts of this bill. The
changes apply to fiscal year 2018 only and ad-
dress the concerns expressed by senior lead-
ership of the Department of Defense to be
able to expend readiness funding within the
confines of existing controls, while still en-
suring accountability of the disbursement of
taxpayer funds. These adjustments are nec-
essary due to the delay of the final passage
of this year’s appropriation bill, combined
with the large funding increase made pos-
sible by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018,
which provides a stable top-line level of
funding for fiscal years 2018 and 2019.
The first adjustment for flexibility is to
Section 8004, which restricts obligations in
the last two months of the fiscal year to 20
percent. This restriction is also known as
the ‘‘80/20 rule.’’ The agreement allows for
the alleviation of the limitation by increas-
ing the amount from 20 percent to 25 per-
cent. This will allow the Services and the
Department more flexibility to obligate an-
nual funds within fiscal year 2018.
The second adjustment is to reprogram-
ming guidelines for readiness funding. The
readiness accounts identified in this agree-
ment under ‘‘Reprogramming Guidance for
Operation and Maintenance Accounts’’ will
not require prior approval, only notification,
for realignments between identified readi-
ness budget lines. It is understood that re-
alignments are required for unforeseen oper-
ational requirements or changes due to pro-
gram cost increases or schedule delays. Com-
mensurate with the lifting of the realign-
ment restrictions, for fiscal year 2018, the
funding amount for the below threshold limi-
tation has been increased from $15,000,000 to
$20,000,000.
ADDITIONAL READINESS FUNDING FOR
OPERATIONS IN THE PACIFIC
The agreement includes funding for the
Army and the Air Force to begin the replen-
ishment process in order to accelerate readi-
ness in the Pacific region. The increased
funding will yield greater operational readi-
ness to forces serving in the Pacific area of
responsibility, specifically in the Republic of
Korea, by investing in additional training,
equipment, and supplies. This funding is a
congressional special interest item. The Sec-
retary of the Army and the Secretary of the
Air Force are directed to submit a detailed
spend plan by sub-activity group to the
House and Senate Defense Appropriations
Subcommittees not less than 30 days prior to
the obligation of these funds.
MAINTENANCE OF REAL PROPERTY
The Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisi-
tion and Sustainment), in conjunction with
the Service Secretaries, is directed to submit
a report to the congressional defense com-
mittees not later than 180 days after the en-
actment of this Act that outlines the total
real property with a zero percent utilization
rate of five years or more currently ac-
counted for in the Department of Defense
real property inventory database and as-
sesses the feasibility of conveying or selling
this property.
DRINKING WATER CONTAMINATION
The Secretary of Defense is directed to
provide quarterly reports to the congres-
sional defense committees on the extent of
the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances con-
tamination in drinking water problem, plans
for community notification, and procedures
for timely remediation.
BOARDS FOR CORRECTION OF MILITARY RECORDS
The Secretary of Defense, in consultation
with the Service Secretaries, is directed to
submit a complete needs assessment of each
Board for Correction of Military Records to
the congressional defense committees not
later than 180 days after the enactment of
this Act.
REPORT ON EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN
SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND
MATHEMATICS
The Secretary of Defense is directed to
submit a report to the congressional defense
committees, not later than two years after
the enactment of this Act, that describes and
assesses current Department of Defense pro-
grams to improve opportunities for Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
(STEM) education for military children and
efforts to increase opportunities and
achievement in STEM education for military
children.
ARMS SALES IMPACT ON INTERNATIONAL
HUMANITARIAN LAW
The Secretary of Defense, in coordination
with the Secretary of State, is directed to
conduct an assessment on whether United
States-supplied defense articles and services
have contributed to violations of human
rights by recipient countries in the past
three years. A report detailing the assess-
ment shall be provided to the congressional
defense committees not later than 180 days
after the enactment of this Act.

INVESTING IN SQUADRON INNOVATION
Fostering a culture of innovation at the
squadron command level to outpace the ef-
forts of competitors in a more complex and
dangerous international security environ-
ment is a top priority of the Chief of Staff of
the Air Force. The vision is to designate spe-
cific resources to spur original, creative
thinking by airmen to solve unit, wing, and
day-to-day issues and readiness challenges.
In support of these efforts, the Secretary of
the Air Force may spend up to $64,100,000 of
fiscal year 2018 operation and maintenance
funding to encourage this type of innovation
across the active, guard, and reserve compo-
nents. In order to assess this investment, the
Secretary of the Air Force is directed to pro-
vide a briefing to the House and Senate De-
fense Appropriations Subcommittees not
later than September 30, 2018, that shall in-
clude, but not be limited to, squadron inno-
vation funding execution details; examples
of successful innovative ideas; lessons
learned; and a determination of whether or
not funding beyond fiscal year 2018 will be
pursued.
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE,
DEFENSE-WIDE
The agreement provides $34,059,257,000 for
Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide,
as follows:

SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND BUDGET
EXECUTION
The consistent realignment of the Special
Operations Command’s operation and main-
tenance funding during the year of execution
is concerning. The agreement directs the
Secretary of Defense to submit a baseline re-
port that shows the Special Operations Com-
mand’s operation and maintenance funding
by sub-activity group for the fiscal year 2018
appropriation not later than 60 days after
the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of
Defense is further directed to submit quar-
terly execution reports to the congressional
defense committees not later than 45 days
after the end of each fiscal quarter that ad-
dresses the rationale for the realignment of
any funds within and between budget sub-ac-
tivities and the movement of any base funds
used to support Overseas Contingency Oper-
ations. Finally, the Secretary of Defense is
directed to notify the congressional defense
committees 30 days prior to the realignment
of funds in excess of $20,000,000 between sub-
activity groups. This language replaces the
language included under the heading ‘‘Spe-
cial Operations Command Budget Execu-
tion’’ in House Report 115–219.
SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND OPERATION AND
MAINTENANCE BUDGET JUSTIFICATION
The agreement directs the Commander of
the Special Operations Command (SOCOM),
in coordination with the Under Secretary of
Defense (Comptroller) and the Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense (Special Operations/Low-
Intensity Conflict), to submit a report that
provides a detailed proposal on how to re-
structure and formalize the budget formula-
tion and execution of the SOCOM budget by
sub-activity group. This report shall also ad-
dress how the proposed restructure will im-
prove visibility of the SOCOM budget and
execution and shall be submitted to the
House and Senate Defense Appropriations
Subcommittees not later than 90 days after
the enactment of this Act.
WOMEN’S MILITARY SERVICE MEMORIALS AND
MUSEUMS
The agreement fully funds Women’s Mili-
tary Service Memorials and Museums at
$5,000,000, as requested in fiscal year 2018.
PROHIBITED INGREDIENTS
The Department’s focus on ensuring that
servicemembers are provided healthy, nutri-
tious food is an important part of military
readiness. The Defense Logistics Agency’s
(DLA) recent notice regarding certain pro-
hibited ingredients lacked stakeholder input
and was rightfully rescinded. Efforts by DLA
to work with industry to assess the impact
of reducing or eliminating certain ingredi-
ents is an important first step. However,
concerns remain about the lack of trans-
parency and scientific justification for re-
stricting certain ingredients. Prior to obli-
gating funding to enact guidance on prohib-
ited ingredients, the Director of DLA is di-
rected to publish scientific justification for
DLA’s August 2017 notice titled ‘‘Request for
Disclosure Regarding Prohibited Ingredi-
ents’’; establish a plan to provide trans-
parent scientific justification; and seek
input from a broad group of stakeholders in-
cluding the Department of Agriculture and
the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices in accordance with the National Nutri-
tion Monitoring and Related Research Act of
1990 (PL 101–445; 7 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.) on all
future nutrition, food or ingredient changes.
The Director of DLA is also directed to pro-
vide notification to the congressional de-
fense subcommittees of the agency’s plans to
implement the above requirements.
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE, ARMY
RESERVE
The agreement provides $2,877,104,000 for
Operation and Maintenance, Army Reserve,

REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION
ACCOUNTS
The Secretary of Defense is directed to
continue to follow the reprogramming guid-
ance as specified in the report accompanying
the House version of the Department of De-
fense Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008
(House Report 110–279). Specifically, the dol-
lar threshold for reprogramming funds shall
remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and
$10,000,000 for research, development, test
and evaluation.
Also, the Under Secretary of Defense
(Comptroller) is directed to continue to pro-
vide the congressional defense committees
quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416
reports for Service and defense-wide ac-
counts in titles III and IV of this Act. Re-
ports for titles III and IV shall comply with
the guidance specified in the explanatory
statement accompanying the Department of
Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The De-
partment shall continue to follow the limita-
tion that prior approval reprogrammings are
set at either the specified dollar threshold or
20 percent of the procurement or research,
development, test and evaluation line,
whichever is less. These thresholds are cu-
mulative from the base for reprogramming
value as modified by any adjustments.
Therefore, if the combined value of transfers
into or out of a procurement (P–1) or re-
search, development, test and evaluation (R–
1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the
Secretary of Defense must submit a prior ap-
proval reprogramming to the congressional
defense committees. In addition, guidelines
on the application of prior approval re-
programming procedures for congressional
special interest items are established else-
where in this statement.
FUNDING INCREASES
The funding increases outlined in these ta-
bles shall be provided only for the specific
purposes indicated in the tables.
PROCUREMENT SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS
Items for which additional funds have been
provided as shown in the project level tables
or in paragraphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’
or ‘‘only to’’ in the explanatory statement
are congressional special interest items for
the purpose of the Base for Reprogramming
(DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be
carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated
amount as specifically addressed in the ex-
planatory statement.
ARSENAL SUSTAINMENT INITIATIVE
The agreement supports ongoing efforts of
the Department of the Army to develop the
Army Organic Industrial Base Strategy. This
process is identifying manufacturing capa-
bilities at each organic industrial facility
that are critical for the country to sustain in
wartime and peacetime if the military is
called to action. However, there are concerns
that while the Army Organic Industrial Base
Strategy is identifying capabilities, they
have not been prioritized in annual budget
requests to Congress. In particular, the Na-
tion’s arsenals are at risk of not having the
capacity to respond rapidly to meet the De-
partment’s needs. Addressing this concern,
in comments the Army provided to the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office (GAO) in ad-
vance of its December 2015 report, ‘‘Actions
Needed to Identify and Sustain Critical Ca-
pabilities,’’ the Army concurred with the
GAO’s recommendation that it must issue
‘‘clear and detailed implementation guid-
ance, such as an instruction or guidebook, on
the process for conducting make-or-buy
analysis in a consistent manner.’’ The Sec-
retary of the Army is directed to issue such
guidance as soon as possible. Further, the
Secretary of the Army is directed to assign
the arsenals sufficient workload to maintain
the critical capabilities identified in the
Army Organic Industrial Base Strategy Re-
port and ensure cost efficiency and technical
competence in peacetime, while preserving
the ability to provide an effective and timely
response to mobilizations, national defense
contingency situations, and other emergency
requirements. Additionally, it is noted that
the congressional defense committees have
not received detailed recommendations from
the Secretary of Defense on how the Air
Force, Navy, and Marine Corps can better
use the arsenals for their manufacturing
needs, or what opportunities may exist for
the arsenals to assist the Services and the
Defense Logistics Agency to procure spare
parts, as required by Senate Report 114–63.
ARMY ORGANIC INDUSTRIAL BASE
The Secretary of the Army is directed to
provide written notification to the congres-
sional defense committees not fewer than 45
days prior to the Secretary approving civil-
ian reductions in force that will result in an
employment loss of 50 or more full-time em-
ployees at any Army organic industrial base
facility.

GROUND MOBILITY VEHICLE
The Army plan to procure a limited quan-
tity of ground mobility vehicles (GMV) for
use by airborne brigades raises concerns due
to the high unit cost of the existing vehicles.
However, due to the urgent requirement and
the advanced stage of the Special Operations
Command GMV program, the agreement in-
cludes full funding for this program and sup-
ports the interim acquisition strategy for 295
A–GMV 1.1 vehicles for fielding to conven-
tional Army airborne brigades and 317 GMV
1.1 vehicles for fielding to the United States
Army Special Operations Command. How-
ever, it is noted that a comparison of GMV
unit cost targets proposed by the Army
against actual unit costs contained in other
Department of Defense contracts indicates
that a developmental vehicle may cost more
per unit than available non-development ve-
hicles.— Therefore, the Secretary of the
Army is directed to conduct a full and open
competition for procurement of the remain-
ing vehicles that satisfy the airborne brigade
requirement.
HIGH MOBILITY MULTIPURPOSE WHEELED
VEHICLE MODERNIZATION
Important safety technologies like
Antilock Brake Systems (ABS) and Elec-
tronic Stability Control (ESC) play a critical
role on the High Mobility Multipurpose
Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) fleet. The agree-
ment supports the incorporation of ABS/ESC
into the HMMWV new production process
and the HMMWV modernization process for
active, reserve, and National Guard compo-
nents. To ensure proper quality control dur-
ing the ABS/ESC installation process for new
and enduring active, reserve, and National
Guard HMMWVs, the Secretary of the Army
is directed to ensure that installation of ABS
on all HMMWVs shall be performed during
the HMMWV new production process or the
HMMWV modernization process, when the
HMMWV produced is new, or returned to a
zero-hour, zero-mile, like-new condition.
AIRCRAFT PROCUREMENT, NAVY
The agreement provides $19,957,380,000 for
Aircraft Procurement, Navy, as follows:

SPACE ACQUISITION STRATEGY
In early 2017, the Office of Cost Assessment
and Program Evaluation (CAPE) provided an
analysis of national security space acquisi-
tion that found a troubling pattern of near-
simultaneous recapitalization of almost
every Department of Defense satellite sys-
tem. The analysis showed a dramatic de-
crease in spending on space research and de-
velopment following recapitalization that re-
sulted in a reduction of scientists and engi-
neers at major satellite contractors in the
following decade. This industrial base de-
cline, in turn, resulted in even higher costs
during the next recapitalization phase as
contractors and the government had to re-
build a skilled workforce for several satellite
architectures concurrently.
There is a concern that the Air Force is
about to embark on another near-simulta-
neous recapitalization of its space architec-
ture as it plans for new development in space
situation awareness; positioning, navigation,
and timing; weather; missile warning; wide-
band communications; and protected com-
munications. In light of the CAPE analysis
and future budget constraints, the Secretary
of the Air Force is directed to provide a re-
port to the congressional defense commit-
tees not later than 60 days after the enact-
ment of this Act, that examines the recapi-
talization plans for the major systems noted
above, certifies that decisions to recapitalize
versus continue production of current de-
signs pose acceptable risks to constellation
sustainment and the acquisition workforce,
and considers budgetary constraints.
SPACE BASED INFRARED SYSTEM
Following submission of the fiscal year
2018 budget request, the Air Force changed
its acquisition strategy for overhead per-
sistent infrared (OPIR) missile warning sys-
tems. The fiscal year 2018 budget request in-
cluded $132,400,000 for advance procurement
for the next block of Space Based Infrared
System (SBIRS) satellites. The agreement
reduces this amount by $50,000,000 and trans-
fers the remaining $82,400,000 to a new pro-
gram, Next Generation OPIR, in Research,
Development, Test and Evaluation, Air
Force, so that the Air Force can begin devel-
opment of a new system that will provide re-
siliency upgrades, payload modernization,
and other enhancements.
The agreement also transfers $173,584,000
from SBIRS High and $71,018,000 from
Evolved SBIRS, both in Research, Develop-
ment, Test and Evaluation, Air Force, to
fund the Next Generation OPIR program.
However, there is a concern that the OPIR
acquisition strategy was still undefined well
into fiscal year 2018 and that the new acqui-
sition strategy, including a spend plan, has
yet to be formally briefed to the congres-
sional defense committees. Therefore, OPIR
is designated as a congressional special in-
terest item and the Secretary of the Air
Force is directed to submit an acquisition
plan, to include cost and schedule estimates,
to the congressional defense committees not
later than 30 days after the enactment of
this Act. The Secretary of the Air Force is
also directed to provide quarterly briefings
to the congressional defense committees de-
tailing progress against cost and schedule
milestones.
PROCUREMENT OF AMMUNITION, AIR
FORCE
The agreement provides $1,651,977,000 for
Procurement of Ammunition, Air Force, as

REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION
ACCOUNTS
The Secretary of Defense is directed to
continue to follow the reprogramming guid-
ance as specified in the report accompanying
the House version of the Department of De-
fense Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008
(House Report 110–279). Specifically, the dol-
lar threshold for reprogramming funds shall
remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and
$10,000,000 for research, development, test
and evaluation.
Also, the Under Secretary of Defense
(Comptroller) is directed to continue to pro-
vide the congressional defense committees
quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416
reports for Service and defense-wide ac-
counts in titles III and IV of this Act. Re-
ports for titles III and IV shall comply with
the guidance specified in the explanatory
statement accompanying the Department of
Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The De-
partment shall continue to follow the limita-
tion that prior approval reprogrammings are
set at either the specified dollar threshold or
20 percent of the procurement or research,
development, test and evaluation line,
whichever is less. These thresholds are cu-
mulative from the base for reprogramming
value as modified by any adjustments.
Therefore, if the combined value of transfers
into or out of a procurement (P–1) or re-
search, development, test and evaluation (R–
1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the
Secretary of Defense must submit a prior ap-
proval reprogramming to the congressional
defense committees. In addition, guidelines
on the application of prior approval re-
programming procedures for congressional
special interest items are established else-
where in this statement.
FUNDING INCREASES
The funding increases outlined in these ta-
bles shall be provided only for the specific
purposes indicated in the tables.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND
EVALUATION SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS
Items for which additional funds have been
provided as shown in the project level tables
or in paragraphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’
or ‘‘only to’’ in the explanatory statement
are congressional special interest items for
the purpose of the Base for Reprogramming
(DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be
carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated
amount as specifically addressed in the ex-
planatory statement.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND
EVALUATION, ARMY
The agreement provides $10,647,426,000 for
Research, Development, Test and Evalua-
tion, Army, as follows:

RAPID PROTOTYPING, EXPERIMENTATION AND
DEMONSTRATION
The fiscal year 2018 President’s budget re-
quest contains $162,000,000 in Research, De-
velopment, Test and Evaluation, Navy lines
29, 36, and 78 for several Rapid Prototyping,
Experimentation and Demonstration (RPED)
projects designated as ‘‘Accelerated Acquisi-
tions for the Rapid Development, Dem-
onstration and Fielding of Capability’’ by
the Chief of Naval Operations and the Assist-
ant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Devel-
opment and Acquisition). Subsequent to the
budget submission, the Navy identified addi-
tional funding requirements of $121,000,000
for these projects that have been addressed
via below threshold reprogramming author-
ity, above threshold reprogramming author-
ity, and additional funds recommended in
this Act.
The Secretary of the Navy and the Chief of
Naval Operations are directed to provide
timely and complete communication to the
House and Senate Defense Appropriations
Subcommittees regarding RPED projects, to
include cost, schedule, progress against pre-
viously identified objectives, and transition
plans. Several factors will be considered
when reviewing each project: requirements,
technology and manufacturing readiness,
cost, schedule, performance, test results, and
transition plans. Funding recommendations
will then be adjusted accordingly. Further,
there are concerns that projects are being se-
lected without a full understanding of the
technological complexity to achieve desired
capabilities. Therefore, the Chief of Naval
Operations and the Assistant Secretary of
the Navy (Research, Development and Acqui-
sition) are directed to consult with the Di-
rector, Operational Test and Evaluation re-
garding accelerated modeling, simulation,
and testing required to achieve and dem-
onstrate defined capabilities prior to the se-
lection of an RPED project, to establish an
agreed-upon test plan and to identify full
funding requirements.
COSTS OF ENGINEERING CHANGE PROPOSALS FOR
MISSILE PROGRAMS
The fiscal year 2018 President’s budget re-
quest includes no less than $101,000,000 for
five development efforts the Navy plans to
incorporate into Tomahawk missiles through
a series of engineering change proposals dur-
ing the missiles’ recertification process. The
development of these modernization initia-
tives is budgeted at close to $900,000,000 over
the next five years, and incorporating these
efforts into production will significantly in-
crease the unit cost of the Tomahawk mis-
sile.
While recognizing the need to modernize
weapons systems through incremental up-
grades, there is concern that the Navy his-
torically has failed to recognize and budget
for the full cost of developing and procuring
missile upgrades through engineering change
proposals upfront. As a result, when pre-
viously funded engineering change proposals
transitioned from development to produc-
tion, the Navy has had to reduce planned
procurement quantities due to higher than
budgeted cost. This has resulted in reduced
capacity in at least two other families of
missiles. The Assistant Secretary of the
Navy (Research, Development and Acquisi-
tion) is directed to provide a report to the
congressional defense committees not later
than 60 days after the enactment of this Act
after conducting a review of the Navy’s ac-
quisition practices for engineering change
proposals in all its missile programs, to in-
clude cost estimating, and to explore meas-
ures on how to inject competition into mod-
ernization efforts in sole source acquisitions.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND
EVALUATION, AIR FORCE
The agreement provides $37,428,078,000 for
Research, Development, Test and Evalua-
tion, Air Force, as follows:

CIVILIAN PERSONNEL
The agreement supports the Air Force pro-
posal to transfer civilian personnel costs of
the acquisition workforce from the Oper-
ation and Maintenance, Air Force account to
the Research, Development, Test and Eval-
uation, Air Force account. To ensure visi-
bility and appropriate execution, the Sec-
retary of the Air Force is directed to submit
an annual report on all civilian personnel
(not limited to the acquisition workforce) re-
lated funding in the Research, Development,
Test and Evaluation, Air Force account by
program element. The report shall include
the budgeted number of civilian full time
equivalents (FTEs) and the related funding
programmed in the current fiscal year and
annually for the next five fiscal years; the
number of actual civilian FTEs and the re-
lated funding executed in current and pre-
vious fiscal years; an explanation of all
below and above threshold reprogrammings
involving civilian personnel funding; and the
impact on staffing and effectiveness of the
acquisition programs. The report shall be
submitted to the congressional defense com-
mittees not later than 90 days after the end
of each fiscal year.
DISTRIBUTED COMMON GROUND SYSTEMS
Several deficiencies exist within the Air
Force’s globally networked intelligence, sur-
veillance, and reconnaissance enterprise, re-
ferred to as Distributed Common Ground
Systems (DCGS). First, the enterprise is ex-
cessively stove-piped which makes it dif-
ficult for the warfighter to provide inte-
grated products that incorporate different
types of intelligence from weapon systems
across different levels of classification. Sec-
ond, the enterprise is not survivable against
cyber threats. Third, the enterprise com-
prises eight separate acquisition programs,
all of which are in the sustainment phase de-
spite new capabilities being regularly tested
and fielded. The Secretary of the Air Force is
directed to submit a report to the congres-
sional defense committees not later than 90
days after the enactment of this Act on a
DCGS modernization roadmap, to include a
plan to accelerate the transition of the eight
acquisition programs and all planned capa-
bilities to an open architecture; a plan to
achieve cyber security for the DCGS enter-
prise; a summary by appropriation of fund-
ing to sustain, develop, test, and field capa-
bilities; and opportunities to use agile soft-
ware development practices.
JOINT SURVEILLANCE TARGET ATTACK RADAR
SYSTEM RECAPITALIZATION
In February 2018, the Air Force detailed its
new position to Congress to terminate the
Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar Sys-
tem (JSTARS) recapitalization program and
pursue alternatives. Despite years of affir-
mations to Congress on the need to pursue
JSTARS recapitalization and an ongoing
source selection process, the Air Force as-
serts that the program will not be viable in
future contested environments and lacks
compelling improvements over legacy capa-
bilities.
The proposal to cancel JSTARS recapital-
ization, pursue alternatives, and ensure no
duplication between efforts requires careful
consideration by Congress through the fiscal
year 2019 budget process. Therefore, the
agreement provides $405,451,000 for JSTARS
recapitalization and designates this funding
as a congressional special interest item. The
Secretary of the Air Force is directed to nei-
ther transfer the funding from JSTARS re-
capitalization, nor utilize these funds for any
purpose other than the JSTARS recapitaliza-
tion program of record as presented with the
fiscal year 2018 budget request, unless the
congressional defense committees receive
and approve a prior approval reprogramming
request.
The Secretary of Defense is directed to
submit a report to the congressional defense
committees not later than 90 days after the
enactment of this Act that addresses the fol-
lowing: the plan for divestment of the cur-
rent E–8C JSTARS fleet and options for sus-
taining the fleet at a level above that plan;
whether it is technically feasible to address
concerns regarding the survivability of the
JSTARS recapitalization platform by chang-
ing system attributes or performance param-
eters (such as radar range and size, weight,
power and cooling margin); the cost and
schedule of alternatives to JSTARS recapi-
talization that are funded in the fiscal year
2019 budget submission and accompanying
future years defense plan; and the cost and
schedule to procure additional weapon sys-
tems (including Army and Navy systems)
that can fulfill mission requirements similar
to those performed by JSTARS in order to

MISSILE DEFENSE AGENCY—SEA–BASED X–BAND
RADAR
Pursuant to section 1684 of the National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2016, the Director, Missile Defense Agency
(MDA), is reviewing possible basing locations
for a Sea-Based X–Band Radar (SBX) in the
Atlantic.— The Director, MDA is encouraged
to consult with the Secretary of the Navy to
avoid homeport sites that negatively impact
national defense infrastructure and prior-
ities, including United States naval oper-
ations such as ship and submarine mainte-
nance activities at public shipyards. Fur-
ther, the Director, MDA and the Secretary of
the Navy are directed to include in the forth-
coming report an evaluation of potential im-
pacts to public shipyards, as well as mitiga-
tion strategies and associated joint costs, for
each Atlantic SBX radar location under con-
sideration.
TRUSTED MICROELECTRONICS
The Under Secretary of Defense (Research
and Engineering) and the Under Secretary of
Defense (Acquisition and Sustainment) are
directed to provide a joint report to the con-
gressional defense committees not later than
90 days after the enactment of this Act
which defines the scope of the microelec-
tronics challenges the Department of De-
fense faces; confirms that the United States
has adequate infrastructure to provide leg-
acy and future chip needs for weapons sys-
tems and what resources are required to pro-
vide for that infrastructure; and lists the
testing protocols that the Department is uti-
lizing to ensure current microelectronics
have achieved security assurance.— The re-
port shall also identify policy concerns to
ensure the Department of Defense complies
sufficiently in conducting the national secu-
rity mission.
STRATEGIC CAPABILITIES OFFICE
The agreement provides $1,183,506,000 for
the Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO). The
Under Secretary of Defense (Research and
Engineering) is directed to provide a report
to the congressional defense committees not
later than 90 days after the enactment of
this Act on the Department’s plan to pre-
serve the ability of SCO to respond to com-
batant commanders’ critical needs and to
augment efforts across the Department with
respect to strategic capabilities development
with new layers of oversight between the Di-
rector of SCO and the Secretary of Defense.
PROJECT MAVEN
The agreement provides $100,000,000 to en-
hance the efforts of the Algorithmic Warfare
Cross-Functional Team on Project Maven
and designates Project Maven and its activi-
ties to date as a congressional special inter-
est item. The Under Secretary of Defense
(Intelligence) is directed to provide a spend
plan for Project Maven not later than 30
days after the enactment of this Act to the
congressional defense committees. Further,
the Under Secretary of Defense (Intel-
ligence), the Under Secretary of Defense (Re-
search and Engineering), and the Depart-
ment of Defense Chief Information Officer
are directed to provide an artificial intel-
ligence and machine learning framework for
the Department of Defense, and specifically
cite the activities of the Services, the De-
fense Advanced Research Projects Agency,
combat support agencies, and laboratories
funded in this Act, to the congressional de-
fense committees not later than 90 days after
the enactment of this Act. The framework
should include an overview of all formal arti-
ficial intelligence, machine learning, and big
data activities; the amounts enacted in the
fiscal year 2018 budget; the amounts included
in the fiscal year 2019 budget request; and
the costs to complete the initial phases of
these activities. The framework should
prioritize these efforts based on cost and im-
pact to the enterprise and clearly identify
how each works together to advance the De-
partment’s ability to leverage artificial in-
telligence and machine learning tech-
nologies. Finally, the framework should de-
lineate which activities align with one or
more of the following focus areas at a min-
imum: vision, text, speech, cybersecurity,
situational awareness including social
media, and enterprise.
CLOUD COMPUTING
The Department of Defense seeks to accel-
erate and streamline the acquisition of cloud
computing services at multiple security lev-
els across the Department in an effort to
provide the benefits of cloud computing
while reducing management and administra-
tive burdens. The Department, under the di-
rection of the Deputy Secretary of Defense,
created the Cloud Executive Steering Group
to oversee this effort, referred to as the
Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure
(JEDI). This effort would be a tailored acqui-
sition for commercial cloud services that
could be a single award indefinite delivery/
indefinite quantity contract for a period of
up to ten years. There are concerns about
the proposed duration of a single contract,
questions about the best value for the tax-
payer, and how to ensure the highest secu-
rity is maintained.
Therefore, the Secretary of Defense is di-
rected to provide a report to the congres-
sional defense committees not later than 60
days after the enactment of this Act detail-
ing a framework for all Department entities,
to include combat support agencies, to ac-
quire cloud computing services including
standards, best practices, contract types,
and exit strategies to ensure government
flexibility as requirements evolve. The re-
port should also include justification, to in-
clude cost considerations, for executing a
single award contract rather than creating
an infrastructure capable of storing and
sharing data across multiple cloud com-
puting service providers concurrently, to in-
clude data migration and middleware costs.
In addition, not later than 45 days after the
enactment of this Act, the Deputy Secretary
of Defense is directed to provide a report on
the JEDI cloud computing services contract
request for proposals (RFP) to the congres-
sional defense committees. The report shall
include the following: the amounts requested
in the fiscal year 2018 and 2019 budget for this
and all other cloud computing services ac-
quisitions by appropriation; the fiscal year
2019 future years defense program levels for
cloud computing services; identification and
justification for acquisitions where ‘‘other
transactional authorities’’ will be utilized;
certification from the Department of De-
fense Chief Information Officer that each of
the military Services, the combatant com-
mands, Defense Information Systems Agen-
cy, and the Chief Information Officers of
each of the Services have been consulted dur-
ing the drafting of the RFP; provisions with-
in the contract to ensure security is main-
tained over the period of the contract; and
provisions for mitigation actions if the com-
mercial entity were to provide services to or
be acquired by a foreign entity or govern-
ment.

REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR THE DEFENSE
HEALTH PROGRAM
Concerns remain regarding the transfer of
funds from the In-House Care budget sub-ac-
tivity to pay for contractor-provided medical
care. To limit such transfers and improve
oversight within the Defense Health Pro-
gram operation and maintenance account,
the agreement includes a provision which
caps the funds available for Private Sector
Care under the TRICARE program subject to
prior approval reprogramming procedures.
The provision and accompanying explana-
tory statement language should not be inter-
preted as limiting the amount of funds that
may be transferred to the In-House Care
budget sub-activity from other budget sub-
activities within the Defense Health Pro-
gram. In addition, funding for the In-House
Care and Private Sector Care budget sub-ac-
tivities are designated as congressional spe-
cial interest items. Any transfer of funds in
excess of $15,000,000 into or out of these sub-
activities requires the Secretary of Defense
to follow prior approval reprogramming pro-
cedures.
The Secretary of Defense is directed to
provide a report to the congressional defense
committees not later than 30 days after the
enactment of this Act that delineates trans-
fers of funds in excess of $10,000,000, and the
dates any transfers occurred, from the Pri-
vate Sector Care budget sub-activity to any
other budget sub-activity groups for fiscal
year 2017.
The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health
Affairs) is directed to provide quarterly re-
ports to the congressional defense commit-
tees on budget execution data for all of the
Defense Health Program budget activities
and to adequately reflect changes to the
budget activities requested by the Services
in future budget submissions.
CARRYOVER
For fiscal year 2018, one percent carryover
authority for the operation and maintenance
account of the Defense Health Program is
recommended. The Assistant Secretary of
Defense (Health Affairs) is directed to sub-
mit a detailed spending plan for any fiscal
year 2017 designated carryover funds to the
congressional defense committees not less
than 30 days prior to executing the carryover
funds.
The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health
Affairs) is further directed to prioritize the
payment of arrears to state vaccine pro-
grams, as authorized by section 719 of the
National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-
cal Year 2017, in expenditure of these carry-
over funds.
PEER-REVIEWED CANCER RESEARCH PROGRAM
The agreement provides $80,000,000 for the
peer-reviewed cancer research program to re-
search cancers not addressed in the breast,

The funds provided in the peer-reviewed
cancer research program are directed to be
used to conduct research in the following
areas: adrenal cancer, bladder cancer, blood
cancers, brain cancer, colorectal cancer,
immunotherapy, listeria-based regimens for
cancer, liver cancer, lymphoma, melanoma
and other skin cancers, mesothelioma,
myeloma, neuroblastoma, pancreatic cancer,
pediatric brain tumors, stomach cancer, and
cancer in children, adolescents, and young
adults.

man’s Explanatory Statement of November
21, 2017 are still required.
PEER-REVIEWED MEDICAL RESEARCH PROGRAM
The agreement provides $330,000,000 for a

The Secretary of Defense, in conjunction
with the Service Surgeons General, is di-
rected to select medical research projects of

military health. Research areas considered
under this funding are restricted to the fol-
lowing areas: acute lung injury, anti-
microbial resistance, arthritis, burn pit ex-
posure, cardiomyopathy, cerebellar ataxia,
chronic migraine and post-traumatic head-
ache, chronic pain management, congenital
heart disease, constrictive bronchiolitis, dia-
betes, dystonia, eating disorders, emerging

inflammatory bowel diseases, interstitial
cystitis, lung injury, malaria, metals toxi-
cology, mitochondrial disease, musculo-
skeletal disorders, myotonic dystrophy, non-

eration, tuberculosis, vaccine development
for infectious diseases, vascular malforma-
tions, and women’s heart disease. The addi-
tional funding provided under the peer-re-
viewed medical research program shall be de-
voted only to the purposes listed above.
ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD
The Program Executive Officer (PEO) for
Defense Healthcare Management Systems
(DHMS), in conjunction with the Director of
the Interagency Program Office (IPO), is di-
rected to provide quarterly reports to the
congressional defense committees on the
cost and schedule of the electronic health
record program, to include milestones,
knowledge points, and acquisition timelines,
as well as quarterly obligation reports.
These reports should also include any
changes to the deployment timeline, includ-
ing benchmarks, for full operating capa-
bility; any refinements to the cost estimate
for full operating capability and the total
lifecycle cost of the project; and the progress
toward developing, implementing, and field-
ing the interoperable electronic health
record throughout the medical facilities of
the Department of Defense and the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs. The PEO DHMS is
further directed to continue briefing the
House and Senate Defense Appropriations
Subcommittees on a quarterly basis, coin-
ciding with the report submission.
Finally, the Director of the IPO is directed
to continue to provide quarterly reports to
the House and Senate Appropriations Com-
mittees, Subcommittees on Defense and

March 22, 2018
PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES
The Secretary of Defense is commended for
the Department’s assistance in developing
principles, standards, and a code of conduct
based on international law, to ensure that
private security companies respect human
rights and the rule of law in the provision of
security assistance services. The Secretary
of Defense is directed to submit a report to
the congressional defense committees not
later than 90 days after enactment of this
Act, on the Department’s standards and
oversight and accountability mechanisms
that apply to private security companies
contracted by the Department of Defense
compared to the standards and mechanisms
that apply to private security companies
contracted by the Department of State.
AFGHANISTAN SECURITY FORCES FUND
CONTRACT COSTS
There remain concerns about the excessive
costs of training contracts awarded using the
Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF).
Therefore, the Comptroller General is di-
rected to examine all ASFF training con-
tracts and provide a report detailing his find-
ings to the congressional defense committees
not later than 180 days after the enactment
of this Act. Additionally, the Secretary of
Defense is directed to provide an accounting
of all contracts funded with ASFF, the an-
nual value of each contract, and the ASFF
line item that funds each contract, to the
congressional defense committees not later
than 180 days after the enactment of this
Act.
AFGHANISTAN SECURITY FORCES FUND BUDGET
JUSTIFICATION
The Secretary of Defense is commended for
efforts to improve the Afghanistan Security
Forces Fund (ASFF) budget justification
materials and Financial Activity Plans
(FAPs). To further inform budget reviews,
the Secretary of Defense is directed to pro-
vide budget justification materials that in-
clude the budget request amount, the appro-
priated amount, and the actual obligation
amount by line item, for the prior two fiscal
years. In addition, concurrent with the sub-
mission of each FAP, the Secretary of De-
fense shall provide the congressional defense
committees with line item detail of planned
funding movements within ASFF using line
item titles from the appropriate year’s budg-
et justification submission. Any line item
that did not appear in the budget justifica-
tion submission shall be delineated as a new
line item.
AFGHAN NATIONAL ARMY UNIFORMS
The House-passed bill included a provision,
Section 10004, banning the use of funds pro-
vided for the Afghanistan Security Forces
Fund to procure uniforms for the Afghan Na-
tional Army (ANA). The Special Inspector
General for Afghanistan Reconstruction re-
ported in June 2017 that the Department of
Defense acquired uniforms for the ANA that
were not appropriate for use in Afghanistan.
The agreement removes the legislative pro-
vision; however, due to underlying concerns
of mismanagement by the Department of De-
fense and the ANA, the Secretary of Defense
is directed to provide a report to the con-
gressional defense committees, not later
than 90 days after the enactment of this Act,
that determines whether current contracting
practices for ANA and Afghan National Po-
lice uniforms conform to all Federal Acquisi-
tion Regulation requirements.
COUNTER-LORD’S RESISTANCE ARMY
The Secretary of Defense, in coordination
with the Secretary of State, is directed to
provide a report on the lessons learned from
Operation Observant Compass, including in
the area of civil-military coordination, and
an assessment of how these lessons are being
institutionalized and applied to other com-
plex crises. The report shall be provided to
the congressional defense and foreign rela-
tions committees not later than 270 days
after the enactment of this Act.
SECURITY SECTOR ASSISTANCE STEERING
COMMITTEE
The Secretary of Defense, in coordination
with the Secretary of State, is directed to
provide a report on the activities and
progress of the Defense Security Sector As-
sistance Steering Committee to the congres-
sional defense and foreign relations commit-
tees not later than 180 days after the enact-
ment of this Act.
PROCUREMENT
The agreement provides $10,424,319,000 for
Procurement, as follows:

components with priority consideration
given to the following items: acoustic hail-
ing devices, active electronically scanned
array radars, advanced cargo handling sys-
tems for CH–47s, advanced targeting pods,
combat uniforms and cold weather protec-
tive clothing, crashworthy ballistically tol-
erant auxiliary internal and external fuel
systems, digital radar warning receivers for
F–16s, electromagnetic in-flight propeller
balance systems, joint threat emitters, large
aircraft infrared countermeasures, modular
container systems for palletized cargo, mod-
ular and self-contained ranges, MQ–9
deployable launch and recovery element mis-
sion support kits, portable high frequency
radios and antennas, radar warning receivers
for C–17s, radiac sets, satellite broadband for
aircraft, commercial-off-the-shelf training
systems/simulators—including for small
arms simulation, sun shades, unmanned sys-
tems for rapid emergency search and rescue

March 22, 2018
DIVISION D—ENERGY AND WATER DEVEL-
OPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES AP-
PROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018
The following statement to the House of
Representatives and the Senate is submitted
in explanation of the agreed upon Act mak-
ing appropriations for energy and water de-
velopment for the fiscal year ending Sep-
tember 30, 2018, and for other purposes.
This explanatory statement, while repeat-
ing some report language for emphasis, does
not intend to negate the language and allo-
cations set forth in House Report 115–230 and
Senate Report 115–132 and that direction
shall be complied with unless specifically ad-
dressed to the contrary in the accompanying
bill or explanatory statement. Additionally,
where this explanatory statement states
that the ‘‘agreement only includes’’’ or ‘‘the
following is the only’’ direction, any direc-
tion included in the House or Senate report
on that matter shall be considered as re-
placed with the direction provided within
this explanatory statement. In cases where
the House or the Senate has directed the
submission of a report, such report is to be
submitted to the Committees on Appropria-
tions of both Houses of Congress. House or
Senate reporting requirements with dead-
lines prior to or within 15 days of the enact-
ment of this Act shall be submitted no later
than 60 days after the enactment of this Act.
All other reporting deadlines not changed by
this explanatory statement are to be met.
Funds for the individual programs and ac-
tivities within the accounts in this Act are
displayed in the detailed table at the end of
the explanatory statement for this Act.
Funding levels that are not displayed in the
detailed table are identified in this explana-
tory statement.
In fiscal year 2018, for purposes of the Bal-
anced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control
Act of 1985 (Public Law 99–177), the following
information provides the definition of the
term ‘‘program, project, or activity’’ for de-
partments and agencies under the jurisdic-
tion of the Energy and Water Development
Appropriations Act. The term ‘‘program,
project, or activity’’ shall include the most
specific level of budget items identified in
the Energy and Water Development Appro-
priations Act, 2018 and the explanatory
statement accompanying the Act.
National Ocean Policy.—No specific fund-
ing was provided in fiscal year 2017 and none
was requested by any agencies funded in this
Act in fiscal year 2018 to implement the Na-
tional Ocean Policy. Consequently, no spe-
cific funds for National Ocean Policy activi-
ties are included for any agency funded in
this Act.
Dam Removal.—No specific funding was
provided in fiscal year 2017 and none was re-
quested by any agencies funded in this Act in
fiscal year 2018 for the purpose of removing a
federally owned or operated dam without
prior authorization by Congress. Con-
sequently, no specific funds for unauthorized
federal dam removal are included for any
agency funded in this Act.
TITLE I—CORPS OF ENGINEERS—CIVIL
DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY
CORPS OF ENGINEERS—CIVIL
The summary tables included in this title
set forth the dispositions with respect to the
individual appropriations, projects, and ac-
tivities of the Corps of Engineers. Additional
items of the Act are discussed below.
Recent statutory changes regarding the In-
land Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) have re-
sulted in an increase to the size of the cap-
ital improvement program that can be sup-
ported by the IWTF. The agreement reflects
congressional interest in supporting this
larger program. The Corps is directed to take
the preparatory steps necessary to ensure
that new construction projects can be initi-
ated as soon as can be supported under the
larger capital program (i.e., as ongoing
projects approach completion).
Concerns persist that the effort to update
the Water Resources Principles and Guide-
lines did not proceed consistent with the lan-
guage or intent of section 2031 of the Water
Resources Development Act of 2007. No funds
provided to the Corps of Engineers shall be
used to develop or implement rules or guid-
ance to support implementation of the final
Principles and Requirements for Federal In-
vestments in Water Resources released in
March 2013 or the final Interagency Guide-
lines released in December 2014. The Corps
shall continue to use the document dated
March 10, 1983, and entitled ‘‘Economic and
Environmental Principles and Guidelines for
Water and Related Land Resources Imple-
mentation Studies’’’ during the fiscal year
period covered by the Energy and Water De-
velopment Appropriations Act for 2018.
Asian Carp.—In lieu of House and Senate
direction, the Secretary of the Army, acting
through the Chief of Engineers, shall make
every effort to submit to Congress the Re-
port of the Chief of Engineers for the Bran-
don Road feasibility study according to the
original published schedule of February 2019.
The Corps is directed to provide quarterly
updates to the Committees on Appropria-
tions of both Houses of Congress on the
progress and status of efforts to prevent the
further spread of Asian carp as well as the
location and density of carp populations, in-
cluding the use of emergency procedures.
The Corps shall continue to collaborate with
the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, the State of Illinois, and
members of the Asian Carp Regional Coordi-
nating Committee to identify and evaluate
whether navigation protocols would be bene-
ficial or effective in reducing the risk of ves-
sels inadvertently carrying aquatic invasive
species, including Asian carp, through the
Brandon Road Lock and Dam in Joliet, Illi-
nois. Any findings of such an evaluation
shall be included in the quarterly briefings
to the Committees. The Corps is further di-
rected to implement protocols shown to be
effective at reducing the risk of entrainment
without jeopardizing the safety of vessels
and crews. The Corps and other federal and
state agencies are conducting ongoing re-
search on potential solutions.
Economic Reevaluation.—None of the
funds provided in this title may be used to
require an economic reevaluation of any
project authorized under title VIII of the
Water Resources Development Act of 2007.
ADDITIONAL FUNDING
The agreement includes funding in addi-
tion to the budget request to ensure contin-
ued improvements to our national economy,
public safety, and environmental health that
result from water resources projects. This
funding is for additional work that either
was not included in the budget request or
was inadequately budgeted. The bill contains
a provision requiring the Corps to allocate
funds in accordance with only the direction
in this agreement. In lieu of all House and
Senate report direction—under any head-
ing—regarding additional funding, new
starts, and the fiscal year 2018 work plan, the
Corps shall follow the direction included in
this explanatory statement.
The Corps again is directed to develop rat-
ing systems for use in evaluating studies and
projects for allocation of the additional
funding provided in this title. These evalua-
tion systems may be, but are not required to
be, individualized for each account, cat-
egory, or subcategory. Voluntary funding in
excess of legally required cost shares for
studies and projects is acceptable, but shall
not be used as a criterion for allocating the
additional funding provided or for the selec-
tion of new starts. Each study and project el-
igible for funding shall be evaluated under
the applicable ratings system. A study or
project may not be excluded from evaluation
for being ‘‘inconsistent with Administration
policy.’’ The Corps retains complete control
over the methodology of these rating sys-
tems. The executive branch retains complete
discretion over project-specific allocation
decisions within the additional funds pro-
vided, subject to only the direction here and
under the heading ‘‘Additional Funding’’ or
‘‘Additional Funding for Ongoing Work’’
within each of the Investigations, Construc-
tion, Mississippi River and Tributaries, and
Operation and Maintenance accounts.
The Administration is reminded that these
funds are in addition to the budget request,
and Administration budget metrics shall not
be a reason to disqualify a study or project
from being funded. It is expected that all of
the additional funding provided will be allo-
cated to specific programs, projects, or ac-
tivities. The focus of the allocation process
shall favor the obligation, rather than ex-
penditure, of funds. With the significant
backlog of work in the Corps’ inventory,
there is no reason for funds provided above
the budget request to remain unallocated.
A project or study shall be eligible for ad-
ditional funding within the Investigations,
Construction, and Mississippi River and
Tributaries accounts if: (1) it has received
funding, other than through a reprogram-
ming, in at least one of the previous three
fiscal years; (2) it was previously funded and
could reach a significant milestone, com-
plete a discrete element of work, or produce
significant outputs in calendar year 2018; or
(3) as appropriate, it is selected as one of the
new starts allowed in accordance with this
Act and the additional direction provided
below. Projects with executed Advanced
Project Partnership Agreements, or similar
agreements, shall be eligible for additional
funding provided in this bill. None of the ad-
ditional funding in any account may be used
for any item where funding was specifically
denied or for projects in the Continuing Au-
thorities Program. Funds shall be allocated
consistent with statutory cost share require-
ments.
Funding associated with each category
may be allocated to any eligible study or
project, as appropriate, within that cat-
egory; funding associated with each sub-
category may be allocated only to eligible
studies or projects, as appropriate, within
that subcategory. The list of subcategories is
not meant to be exhaustive. There is concern
that the fiscal year 2017 work plan allocated
Operation and Maintenance funding to some
activities historically funded in the Con-
struction account. Any shift in funding be-
tween accounts should be proposed in a budg-
et request and addressed through the appro-
priations process. Funding levels for ac-
counts and additional funding categories are
developed based on assessment of the scope
of activities that can be advanced within
each account and category. Shifting activi-
ties between accounts or categories after
these funding level decisions are made is a
gross misuse of the flexibility inherent in
the work plan process. Since the extent of
changes proposed in the fiscal year 2018
budget request is not clear, the Corps shall
evaluate all studies and projects only within
accounts and categories consistent with pre-
vious congressional funding.
Work Plan.—Not later than 60 days after
the enactment of this Act, the Corps shall
provide to the Committees on Appropria-
tions of both Houses of Congress a work plan
including the following information: (1) a de-
tailed description of the ratings system(s)
VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:28 Mar 28, 2018 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00391 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A22MR7.043 H22MRPT2
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

developed and used to evaluate studies and
projects; (2) delineation of how these funds
are to be allocated; (3) a summary of the
work to be accomplished with each alloca-
tion, including phase of work; and (4) a list
of all studies and projects that were consid-
ered eligible for funding but did not receive
funding, including an explanation of whether
the study or project could have used funds in
calendar year 2018 and the specific reasons
each study or project was considered as
being less competitive for an allocation of
funds.
New Starts.—The agreement includes six
new starts in the Investigations account and
five new starts in the Construction account
to be distributed across the three main mis-
sion areas of the Corps. The agreement also
includes one new study start in the Mis-
sissippi River and Tributaries account to
evaluate the need for improvements for flood
control, ecosystem restoration, water qual-
ity and related purposes associated with
storm water runoff and management.
Of the new starts in Investigations, two
shall be for navigation studies, one shall be
for a flood and storm damage reduction
study, two shall be for additional navigation
or flood and storm damage reduction studies,
and one shall be for an environmental res-
toration study. Of the new construction
starts, one shall be for a navigation project;
one shall be for a flood and storm damage re-
duction project; two shall be for additional
navigation or flood and storm damage reduc-
tion projects, of which one shall be a coastal
storm damage reduction project; and one
shall be for an environmental restoration
project. Other than the one new study start
directed above, no funding shall be used to
initiate new programs, projects, or activities
in the Mississippi River and Tributaries or
Operation and Maintenance accounts.
The Corps is directed to propose a single
group of new starts as a part of the work
plan. None of the funds may be used for any
item for which the agreement has specifi-
cally denied funding. The Corps may not
change or substitute the new starts selected
once the work plan has been provided to the
Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress. Each new start shall be
funded from the appropriate additional fund-
ing line item. Any project for which the new
start requirements are not met by the end of
fiscal year 2018 shall be treated as if the
project had not been selected as a new start;
such a project shall be required to compete
again for new start funding in future years.
As all new starts are to be chosen by the
Corps, all shall be considered of equal impor-
tance, and the expectation is that future
budget submissions will include appropriate
funding for all new starts selected.
There continues to be confusion regarding
the executive branch’s policies and guide-
lines regarding which studies and projects
require new start designations. Therefore,
the Corps is directed to notify the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress at least 7 days prior to execution of
an agreement for construction of any project
except environmental infrastructure projects
and projects under the Continuing Authori-
ties Program. Additionally, the agreement
reiterates and clarifies previous congres-
sional direction as follows. Neither study nor
construction activities related to individual
projects authorized under section 1037 of the
Water Resources Reform and Development
Act (WRRDA) of 2014 shall require a new
start or new investment decision; these ac-
tivities shall be considered ongoing work. No
new start or new investment decision shall
be required when moving from feasibility to
preconstruction engineering and design
(PED). A new start designation shall be re-
quired to initiate construction of individ-
ually-authorized projects funded within pro-
grammatic line items. No new start or new
investment decision shall be required to ini-
tiate work on a separable element of a
project when construction of one or more
separable elements of that project was initi-
ated previously; it shall be considered ongo-
ing work. A new construction start shall not
be required for work undertaken to correct a
design deficiency on an existing federal
project; it shall be considered ongoing work.
In addition to the priority factors used to
allocate all additional funding provided in
the Investigations account, the Corps should
give careful consideration to the out-year
budget impacts of the studies selected and to
whether there appears to be an identifiable
local sponsor that will be ready and able to
provide, in a timely manner, the necessary
cost share for the feasibility and PED
phases. The Corps is reminded that the flood
and storm damage reduction mission area
can include instances where non-federal
sponsors are seeking assistance with flood
control and unauthorized discharges from
permitted wastewater treatment facilities
and that the navigation mission area in-
cludes work in remote and subsistence har-
bor areas.
In addition to the priority factors used to
allocate all additional funding provided in
the Construction account, the Corps also
shall consider the out-year budget impacts of
the selected new starts; and the cost sharing
sponsor’s ability and willingness to promptly
provide the cash contribution (if any), as
well as required lands, easements, rights-of-
way, relocations, and disposal areas. When
considering new construction starts, only
those that can execute a project cost sharing
agreement not later than September 30, 2018,
shall be chosen.
To ensure that the new construction starts
are affordable and will not unduly delay
completion of any ongoing projects, the Sec-
retary is required to submit to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress a realistic out-year budget scenario
prior to issuing a work allowance for a new
start. It is understood that specific budget
decisions are made on an annual basis and
that this scenario is neither a request for nor
a guarantee of future funding for any
project. Nonetheless, this scenario shall in-
clude an estimate of annual funding for each
new start utilizing a realistic funding sce-
nario through completion of the project, as
well as the specific impacts of that esti-
mated funding on the ability of the Corps to
make continued progress on each previously
funded construction project (including im-
pacts to the optimum timeline and funding
requirements of the ongoing projects) and on
the ability to consider initiating new
projects in the future. The scenario shall as-
sume a Construction account funding level
at the average of the past three budget re-
quests.
INVESTIGATIONS
The agreement includes $123,000,000 for In-
vestigations. The agreement includes legisla-
tive language regarding parameters for new
study starts.
The allocation for projects and activities
within the Investigations account is shown
in the following table:

March 22, 2018
Updated Capability.—The agreement ad-
justs some project-specific allocations down-
ward from the budget request based on up-
dated information regarding the amount of
work that could be accomplished in fiscal
year 2018.
Passaic River Basin Mainstem, New Jer-
sey.—Flooding has long been a problem in
the Passaic River Basin. The Corps is en-
couraged to continue to work in coordina-
tion with the non-federal sponsor on plans to
reduce flooding in the basin, including the
reevaluation of the Passaic River Basin
Mainstem project. The Corps is directed to
brief the Committees on Appropriations of
both Houses of Congress not later than 30
days after the enactment of this Act on the
current status of this project.
Peckman River, New Jersey.—There have
been repeated delays with the Peckman
River Feasibility Study. The Corps is di-
rected to provide to the Committees on Ap-
propriations of both Houses of Congress
quarterly briefings on the current schedule
to bring this study to completion, with the
first briefing to occur not later than 30 days
after the enactment of this Act.
Rahway River Basin (Upper Basin), New
Jersey.—There have been extended delays
with the Rahway River Basin Flood Risk
Management Feasibility Study where flood-
ing is of acute concern to the affected com-
munities. The Corps is encouraged to con-
tinue to work with the non-federal sponsor
on plans to reduce flooding caused by the
Rahway River in affected areas. The Corps is
directed to provide to the Committees on Ap-
propriations of both Houses of Congress
quarterly briefings on the current schedule
to bring this study to completion, with the
first briefing to occur not later than 30 days
after the enactment of this Act.
Columbia River Treaty 2024 Implementa-
tion, Oregon and Washington.—The agree-
ment includes funding for this activity in
the Operation and Maintenance account, as
in previous years.
Additional Funding.—The Corps is ex-
pected to allocate the additional funding
provided in this account primarily to spe-
cific feasibility and PED phases, rather than
to Remaining Items line items as has been
the case in previous work plans. Of the addi-
tional funds provided in this account for
navigation and coastal and deep draft navi-
gation, the Corps shall allocate not less than
$2,200,000 for the continuation of ongoing
General Reevaluation Reports. When allo-
cating the additional funding provided in
this account, the Corps shall consider giving
priority to completing or accelerating ongo-
ing studies or to initiating new studies that
will enhance the nation’s economic develop-
ment, job growth, and international com-
petitiveness; are for projects located in areas
that have suffered recent natural disasters;
are for projects that protect life and prop-
erty; or are for projects to address legal re-
quirements. The Corps shall use these funds
for additional work in both the feasibility
and PED phases. The agreement includes suf-
ficient additional funding to undertake a sig-
nificant amount of feasibility and PED work.
The Administration is reminded that a
project study is not complete until the PED
phase is complete.
The Corps is reminded that the following
activities are eligible to compete for addi-
tional funding: development of a hydraulic
model that will assist no fewer than five
States along a major navigable waterway
with making regional strategic flood risk
management decisions, the updating of eco-
nomic analyses, and the updating of eco-
nomic impact studies.
Water Resources Priorities Study.—No
funding shall be used for this study.
Research and Development.—Within avail-
able funds, the Corps shall advance work on
activities included in the House and Senate
reports.
SMART Planning.—The agreement in-
cludes the House direction. Additionally, the
Corps is reminded of the fiscal year 2016 di-
rection to evaluate each North Atlantic
Coast Comprehensive Study focus area to de-
termine the appropriate scope, schedule, and
cost, without the initial time and cost limits
of the 3x3x3 process. Particularly for com-
prehensive or regional studies that have sig-
nificantly larger study areas than typical
feasibility studies, it may not be advisable to
identify a tentatively selected plan prior to
determining whether an exemption from the
3x3x3 process is prudent. Common sense de-
terminations early in the feasibility process
can avoid the wasted time and funding inher-
ent in changing course late in the process.
Section 1143 Study.—The Corps is encour-
aged to include in future budget submissions
the study of sediment sources authorized in
section 1143 of Public Law 114–322.
Puget Sound.—In addition to Senate direc-
tion, the Corps is reminded that no new
start, new investment decision, or new phase
decision shall be required to move the Puget
Sound Nearshore Ecosystem Restoration
Project from feasibility to PED.
CONSTRUCTION
The agreement includes $2,085,000,000 for
Construction. The agreement includes legis-
lative language regarding parameters for
new construction starts.
The allocation for projects and activities
within the Construction account is shown in
the following table:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2445
March 22, 2018
Updated Capability.—The agreement ad-
justs some project-specific allocations down-
ward from the budget request based on up-
dated information regarding the amount of
work that could be accomplished in fiscal
year 2018.
Additional Funding.—The agreement in-
cludes additional funds for projects and ac-
tivities to enhance the nation’s economic
growth and international competitiveness.
Of the additional funds provided in this ac-
count, the Corps shall allocate not less than
$2,850,000 to projects with riverfront develop-
ment components. Of the additional funding
provided in this account for flood and storm
damage reduction and flood control, the
Corps shall allocate not less than $5,400,000
to additional nonstructural flood control
projects. Of the additional funds provided in
this account for flood and storm damage re-
duction, navigation, and other authorized
project purposes, the Corps shall allocate not
less than $15,000,000 to authorized reimburse-
ments for projects with executed project co-
operation agreements and that have com-
pleted construction or where nonfederal
sponsors intend to use the funds for addi-
tional water resources development activi-
ties. Of the additional funding provided in
this account for flood and storm damage re-
duction and flood control, the Corps shall al-
locate not less than $7,000,000 to continue
construction of projects that principally in-
clude improvements to rainfall drainage sys-
tems that address flood damages. Of the ad-
ditional funding provided for flood and storm
damage reduction, flood control, and envi-
ronmental restoration or compliance, the
Corps shall allocate not less than $1,000,000
for projects for hurricane and storm damage
risk reduction and environmental restora-
tion with both structural and nonstructural
project elements.
The Corps is reminded that dam safety
projects authorized under section 5003 of the
Water Resources Development Act of 2007 are
eligible to compete for the additional fund-
ing provided in this account.
When allocating the additional funding
provided in this account, the Corps shall con-
sider eligibility and implementation deci-
sions under Public Law 115–123 so as to maxi-
mize the reduction of risk to public safety
and infrastructure and the reduction of fu-
ture damages from floods and storms nation-
wide. Public Law 115–123 included funding
within the Flood Control and Coastal Emer-
gencies account to restore authorized shore
protection projects to full project profile.
That funding is expected to address most of
the current year capability. Therefore, to en-
sure funding is not directed to where it can-
not be used, the agreement includes
$50,000,000 for construction of shore protec-
tion projects. The Corps is reminded that if
additional work can be done, these projects
are also eligible to compete for additional
funding for flood and storm damage reduc-
tion.
When allocating the additional funding
provided in this account, the Corps is en-
couraged to evaluate authorized reimburse-
ments in the same manner as if the projects
were being evaluated for new or ongoing con-
struction and shall consider giving priority
to the following:
1. benefits of the funded work to the na-
tional economy;
2. extent to which the work will enhance
national, regional, or local economic devel-
opment;
3. number of jobs created directly by the
funded activity;
4. ability to obligate the funds allocated
within the calendar year, including consider-
ation of the ability of the non-federal spon-
sor to provide any required cost share;
5. ability to complete the project, sepa-
rable element, or project phase with the
funds allocated;
6. legal requirements, including respon-
sibilities to Tribes;
7. for flood and storm damage reduction
projects (including authorized nonstructural
measures and periodic beach renourish-
ments),
a. population, economic activity, or public
infrastructure at risk, as appropriate; and
b. the severity of risk of flooding or the
frequency with which an area has experi-
enced flooding;
8. for shore protection projects, projects in
areas that have suffered severe beach erosion
requiring additional sand placement outside
of the normal beach renourishment cycle or
in which the normal beach renourishment
cycle has been delayed;
9. for navigation projects, the number of
jobs or level of economic activity to be sup-
ported by completion of the project, sepa-
rable element, or project phase;
10. for projects cost shared with the Inland
Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF), the economic
impact on the local, regional, and national
economy if the project is not funded, as well
as discrete elements of work that can be
completed within the funding provided in
this line item;
11. for other authorized project purposes
and environmental restoration or compli-
ance projects, to include the beneficial use of
dredged material; and
12. for environmental infrastructure,
projects with the greater economic impact,
projects in rural communities, projects in
communities with significant shoreline and
instances of runoff, projects in or that ben-
efit counties or parishes with high poverty
rates, projects in financially distressed mu-
nicipalities, and projects that will provide
substantial benefits to water quality im-
provements.
The agreement provides funds making use
of all estimated annual revenues in the
IWTF. The Corps shall allocate all funds pro-
vided in the IWTF Revenues line item along
with the statutory cost share from funds pro-
vided in the Navigation line item prior to al-
locating the remainder of funds in the Navi-
gation line item.
Aquatic Plant Control Program.—Of the
funding provided for the Aquatic Plant Con-
trol Program, $1,000,000 shall be for activities
for the control of the flowering rush. Of the
funding provided for the Aquatic Plant Con-
trol Program, $5,000,000 shall be for nation-
wide research and development to address
invasive aquatic plants; within this funding,
the Corps is encouraged to support cost
shared aquatic plant management programs.
Of the funding provided for the Aquatic
Plant Control Program, $5,000,000 shall be for
watercraft inspection stations, as authorized
by section 1039 of the Water Resources Re-
form and Development Act of 2014, and re-
lated monitoring.
Continuing Authorities Program (CAP).—
The agreement continues to support all sec-
tions of the Continuing Authorities Pro-
gram. Funding is provided for eight CAP sec-
tions at a total of $40,500,000, an increase of
$31,500,000 above the budget request, which
proposed funding for only four sections. This
program provides a useful tool for the Corps
to undertake small localized projects with-
out the lengthy study and authorization
process typical of larger Corps projects.
Within the Continuing Authorities Program
and to the extent already authorized by law,
the Corps is encouraged to consider projects
that enhance coastal and ocean ecosystem
resiliency, projects in regions comprised of
cities whose historic flooding has been
caused predominantly by winter snowmelt
and ice floes, and projects that address ero-
sion problems jeopardizing box culvert cross-
ings on public roadways. The management of
the Continuing Authorities Program shall
continue consistent with direction provided
in previous fiscal years.
Alternative Financing.—The agreement
only includes direction in the Expenses ac-
count.
Oyster Restoration.—The Corps is encour-
aged to include funding in future budget sub-
missions for the Chesapeake Bay Oyster Res-
toration program.
The Dalles Dam.—The agreement includes
Senate language. Additionally, the Adminis-
tration is directed to brief the Committees
on Appropriations of both Houses of Con-
gress not later than 15 days after enactment
of this Act on any decision to require a new
start determination or new investment deci-
sion for additional work on an ongoing plan,
including justification if such a decision has
been made.
McCook Reservoir.—In addition to the
Senate report language, the Corps is encour-
aged to provide sufficient funding in future
budget submissions.
MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND TRIBUTARIES
The agreement includes $425,000,000 for
Mississippi River and Tributaries.
The allocation for projects and activities
within the Mississippi River and Tributaries
account is shown in the following table:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2470 March 22, 2018
Updated Capability.—The agreement ad-
justs some project-specific allocations down-
ward from the budget request based on up-
dated information regarding the amount of
work that could be accomplished in fiscal
year 2018.
Surveillance of Northern Boundary Waters,
Oregon.—The agreement includes funding for
activities in support of the Columbia River
Treaty in this line item, as in previous
years, rather than in a new line item ‘‘Co-
lumbia River Treaty 2024 Implementation,
OR & WA’’ in the Investigations account as
in the budget request.
Additional Funding for Ongoing Work.—
When allocating the additional funding pro-
vided in this account, the Corps shall con-
sider giving priority to the following:
1. ability to complete ongoing work main-
taining authorized depths and widths of har-
bors and shipping channels, including where
contaminated sediments are present;
2. ability to address critical maintenance
backlog;
3. presence of the U.S. Coast Guard;
4. extent to which the work will enhance
national, regional, or local economic devel-
opment, including domestic manufacturing
capacity;
5. extent to which the work will promote
job growth or international competitiveness;
6. number of jobs created directly by the
funded activity;
7. ability to obligate the funds allocated
within the calendar year;
8. ability to complete the project, sepa-
rable element, project phase, or useful incre-
ment of work within the funds allocated;
9. risk of imminent failure or closure of
the facility; and
10. for harbor maintenance activities,
a. total tonnage handled;
b. total exports;
c. total imports;
d. dollar value of cargo handled;
e. energy infrastructure and national secu-
rity needs served;
f. designation as strategic seaports;
g. lack of alternative means of freight
movement; and
h. savings over alternative means of
freight movement.
Additional funding provided for donor and
energy transfer ports shall be allocated in
accordance with 33 U.S.C. 2238c. The Corps is
encouraged to include funding for this pro-
gram in future budget requests.
Facility Protection.—The agreement pro-
vides funding for completion and deployment
of tools to address hydrologic extremes.
Monitoring of Completed Navigation
Projects.—Of the funding provided, $3,700,000
shall be to support the structural health
monitoring program to facilitate research to
maximize operations, enhance efficiency,
and protect asset life through catastrophic
failure mitigation and $2,000,000 shall be for
research related to the impacts of reduced
navigational lock operations as described in
the Senate report. The Corps is encouraged
to also consider the need for additional work
on the evaluation of grouted trunnion rods
and the validation of technologies such as
protective coatings.
Water Operations Technical Support.—
Funding in addition to the budget request is
included for research into atmospheric rivers
first funded in fiscal year 2015. The Corps is
directed to brief the Committees on Appro-
priations of both Houses of Congress not
later than 30 days after the enactment of
this Act on the application of this work to
other locations and projects, including tech-
nical transferability, cost estimates, and ap-
propriate budget structure.
Great Lakes Navigation System.—The
agreement includes funding for individual
projects within this System that exceeds the
funding level envisioned in section
210(d)(1)(B)(ii) of the Water Resources Devel-
opment Act of 1986.
Beneficial Use of Dredged Material.—In ad-
dition to Senate direction, the Corps shall
brief the Committees on Appropriations of
both Houses of Congress not later than 30
days after the enactment of this Act on the
status of implementation of this authority,
including schedule, project selection details,
cost estimates, and planned budget struc-
ture.
Coastal Inlet Research Program.—Funding
in addition to the budget request is included
for the Corps to work with the National Oce-
anic and Atmospheric Administration’s Na-
tional Water Center on protecting the na-
tion’s water resources.
REGULATORY PROGRAM
The agreement includes $200,000,000 for the
Regulatory Program.
Aquaculture Activities.—The agreement
includes House and Senate direction.
FORMERLY UTILIZED SITES REMEDIAL ACTION
PROGRAM
The agreement includes $139,000,000 for the
Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action
Program.
FLOOD CONTROL AND COASTAL EMERGENCIES
The agreement includes $35,000,000 for
Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies. The
agreement does not include use of prior-year
balances.
EXPENSES
The agreement includes $185,000,000 for Ex-
penses.
Alternative financing.—There is support
among Members of Congress and within the
Administration for public-private partner-
ships (P3) and other alternative financing
mechanisms. These arrangements have the
potential to be project delivery tools to help
sustain the performance of existing infra-
structure and construct new infrastructure
more quickly. In fiscal year 2016, the Corps
was directed to develop a policy on how pro-
posals for public-private partnerships will be
considered by the Corps and how these part-
nerships will be incorporated into the budget
policy. A policy will allow interested non-
federal sponsors equal opportunity to de-
velop proposals for the Corps to review under
established guidelines. To date, the Corps
has not developed a policy. Therefore, the
Corps is directed to issue this policy not
later than 180 days after the enactment of
this Act. Concurrently, the Corps shall pro-
vide to the Committees on Appropriations of
both Houses of Congress a report on poten-
tial project and alternative financing evalua-
tion metrics, including identifying the via-
bility of using total return on federal invest-
ment as a metric for analyzing projects
while also considering and addressing long-
standing equity concerns that federal fund-
ing decisions not be biased by non-federal de-
cisions to construct projects in advance of
federal funding or to provide funding in ex-
cess of legally required cost shares. Until
such policy is issued, the Corps shall dis-
continue all work on project specific public-
private partnerships beyond the P3 project
selected as a new start in fiscal year 2016.
Implementation guidance.—The Corps is
directed to issue expeditiously implementa-
tion guidance for section 1043 of the Water
Resources Reform and Development Act of
2014 (non-federal implementation pilot pro-
gram).
OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE
ARMY FOR CIVIL WORKS
The agreement includes $5,000,000 for the
Office of the Assistant Secretary of the
Army for Civil Works. The agreement in-
cludes legislative language that restricts the
availability of funding until the Secretary
submits a work plan that allocates at least
95 percent of the additional funding provided
in each account (i.e., 95 percent of additional
funding provided in Investigations, 95 per-
cent of additional funding provided in Con-
struction, etc.). This restriction shall not af-
fect the roles and responsibilities established
in previous fiscal years of the Office of the
Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil
Works, the Corps headquarters, the Corps
field operating agencies, or any other execu-
tive branch agency.

BUREAU OF RECLAMATION
In lieu of all House and Senate report di-
rection regarding additional funding and the
fiscal year 2018 work plan, the agreement in-
cludes direction under the heading ‘‘Addi-
tional Funding for Water and Related Re-
sources Work’’ in the Water and Related Re-
sources account.
WATER AND RELATED RESOURCES
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
The agreement includes $1,332,124,000 for
Water and Related Resources. The agree-
ment includes legislative language, in ac-
cordance with Public Law 114–322, to allow
the use of certain funding provided in fiscal
year 2017.
The catastrophic drought in the western
United States over the past several years has
impacted community access to life-giving
water. Accordingly, the agreement supports
the Interior Department’s efforts to com-
plete feasibility studies or initiate construc-
tion on seven projects identified by the De-
partment in the State of California, State of
Idaho, and State of Washington, consistent
with Section 4007 of Public Law 114–322. The
Department is directed to work expedi-
tiously to bring these projects to fruition.
Furthermore, funds made available in ac-
cordance with Section 4007 of Public Law
114–322 shall not be expended on construction

March 22, 2018
Scoggins Dam, Tualatin Project, Oregon.—
The agreement supports the administration’s
budget request for preconstruction activities
at Scoggins Dam under the Safety of Dams
program. Consistent with the Tualatin
Project Water Supply Feasibility Study au-
thorized in Public Law 108–137 and statutory
authority granted by Public Law 114–113 al-
lowing for additional benefits to be con-
ducted concurrently with dam safety im-
provements, Reclamation is directed to
evaluate alternatives, including new or sup-
plementary works, provided that safety re-
mains the paramount consideration, to ad-
dress dam safety modifications and increased
storage capacity. Considering the high risk
associated with Scoggins Dam, Reclamation
is encouraged to work with local stake-
holders and repayment contractors on this
joint project including feasibility and envi-
ronmental review of the preferred alter-
native. A replacement structure downstream
could significantly reduce project costs for
both the federal government and local stake-
holders. Reclamation may accept contrib-
uted funds from non-federal contractors to
expedite completion of any level of review.
Salton Sea.—The agreement includes Sen-
ate direction.
Additional Funding for Water and Related
Resources Work.—The agreement includes
funds in addition to the budget request for
Water and Related Resources studies,
projects, and activities. Priority in allo-
cating these funds should be given to ad-
vance and complete ongoing work, including
preconstruction activities and where envi-
ronmental compliance has been completed;
improve water supply reliability; improve
water deliveries; enhance national, regional,
or local economic development; promote job
growth; advance tribal and nontribal water
settlement studies and activities; or address
critical backlog maintenance and rehabilita-
tion activities. Of the additional funding pro-
vided under the heading ‘‘Water Conserva-
tion and Delivery’’, $134,000,000 shall be for
water storage projects as authorized in sec-
tion 4007 of Public Law 114–322. Of the addi-
tional funding provided under the heading
‘‘Environmental Restoration or Compli-
ance’’, not less than $30,000,000 shall be for
activities authorized under sections 4001 and
4010 of Public Law 114–322 or as set forth in
federal-state plans for restoring threatened
and endangered fish species affected by the
operation of the Bureau of Reclamation’s
water projects.
Not later than 45 days after the enactment
of this Act, Reclamation shall provide to the
Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress a report delineating how
these funds are to be distributed, in which
phase the work is to be accomplished, and an
explanation of the criteria and rankings used
to justify each allocation.
Reclamation is reminded that activities
authorized under Indian Water Rights Set-
tlements and under section 206 of Public Law
113–235 are eligible to compete for the addi-
tional funding provided under ‘‘Water Con-
servation and Delivery’’.
Research and Development: Desalination
and Water Purification Program.—Of the
funding provided for this program, $12,000,000
shall be for desalination projects as author-
ized in section 4009(a) of Public Law 114–322.
WaterSMART Program: Title XVI Water
Reclamation & Reuse Program.—Of the fund-
ing provided for this program, $20,000,000
shall be for water recycling and reuse
projects as authorized in section 4009(c) of
Public Law 114–322.
Projects Serving Military Installations.—
Reclamation is directed to submit to the
Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress not later than 120 days
after enactment of this Act a report describ-
ing existing programs, authorities, and fund-
ing options available to advance water
projects that serve military installations.
Reclamation shall consult with the Depart-
ment of Defense in developing this report.
Rural Water.—Voluntary funding in excess
of legally required cost shares for rural
water projects is acceptable, but shall not be
used by Reclamation as a criterion for allo-
cating additional funding provided in this
agreement or for budgeting in future years.
WIIN Act Implementation.—The Bureau of
Reclamation is directed to move expedi-
tiously on implementation of the WIIN Act
(Public Law 114–322). Specifically, Reclama-
tion is expected to recommend water storage
projects for funding under section 4007 and
water desalination projects for funding under
section 4009(a) by no later than September
30, 2018. To meet this deadline, Reclamation,
by no later than April 30, 2018, shall develop
guidelines and criteria for administering sec-
tion 4009(a) and issue a funding opportunity
announcement for funding provided under
that section in fiscal years 2017 and 2018.
Title XVI Evaluation Criteria.—The Sec-
retary is directed to review the technical
proposal evaluation criteria in future fund-
ing opportunity announcements associated
with water recycling and reuse projects to
ensure that a diversity of water recycling
projects are able to equitably compete for
funding. When evaluating projects for avail-
able funding, the Secretary is directed to
consider that a project’s economic benefits
can be measured in multiple ways, not only
through cost per acre-foot of water gen-
erated, to ensure an equitable comparison of
projects. Further, the Secretary is directed
to consider the cost per acre-foot of each
project in comparison to other water supply
alternatives available within the project
area and the cost per acre-foot of water gen-
erated by projects with similar characteris-
tics.
Buried Metallic Water Pipe.—Reclamation
shall continue following its temporary de-
sign guidance.
CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT RESTORATION FUND
The agreement provides $41,376,000 for the
Central Valley Project Restoration Fund.

ing aquifer recharge at a project.
TITLE III—DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY
The agreement provides $34,520,049,000 for
the Department of Energy to fund programs
in its primary mission areas of science, en-
ergy, environment, and national security.
The Department is prohibited from funding
fellowship and scholarship programs in fiscal
year 2018 unless the programs were explicitly
included in the budget justification or fund-
ed within this agreement. The Department is
expected to spend funds as provided for with-
in this agreement in an expeditious manner,
to include the issuance of funding oppor-
tunity announcements and awards of funds.
Five-Year Plan.—The Department is di-
rected to submit to the Committees on Ap-
propriations of both Houses of Congress not
later than September 30, 2018 a report on the
plan to comply with 42 U.S.C. 7279a.

the House and Senate reports.
Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT).—In lieu
of House direction, DOE shall conduct a re-
view of its current PILT agreements and pro-
vide to the Committees on Appropriations of
both Houses of Congress not later than 180
days after enactment of this Act a report
that describes the following:
(1) the terms and costs of each PILT agree-
ment;
(2) a description of how DOE determines
site eligibility;
(3) an analysis of whether the current
PILT agreements use methods of calculation
that are consistent with current DOE policy
guidelines, with guidance in the Atomic En-
ergy Act that the Department shall be guid-
ed by the policy of not making payments in
excess of the taxes which would have been
payable for such property in the condition in
which it was acquired, or with methods of
calculation at other DOE sites;
(4) an explanation for any agreements with
notable variances, including special burdens;
(5) a description of DOE procedures for ne-
gotiating and approving new agreements, in-
cluding internal oversight mechanisms in
place;
(6) recommendations for changes needed to
ensure that agreements are consistent across

propriation. For construction projects, a re-
programming constitutes the reallocation of
funds from one construction project to an-
other project or a change of $2,000,000 or 10
percent, whichever is less, in the scope of an
approved project.

Small Refinery Exemption.—Under section
211(o)(9)(B) of the Clean Air Act, a small re-
finery may petition the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency (EPA) Administrator for an
exemption from the Renewable Fuel Stand-
ard (RFS) on the basis that the refinery ex-
periences a disproportionate economic hard-
ship under the RFS. When evaluating a peti-
tion, the Administrator consults with the
Secretary of Energy to determine whether
disproportionate economic hardship exists.
According to the Department’s March 2011
Small Refinery Exemption Study, dispropor-
tionate economic hardship must encompass
two broad components: a high cost of compli-
ance relative to the industry average dis-
proportionate impacts, and an effect suffi-
cient to cause a significant impairment of
the refinery operations’ viability. If the Sec-
retary finds that either of these two compo-
nents exists, the Secretary is directed to rec-
ommend to the EPA Administrator at least
a 50 percent waiver of RFS requirements for
the petitioner. The Secretary also is directed
to score all of the metrics in the study and
to score the metrics according to the 2011
study scoring criteria and not any later ad-
dendum to the study. The Secretary is di-
rected to seek small refinery comment be-
fore making changes to its scoring metrics
for small refinery petitions for RFS waivers
and to notify the Committees on Appropria-
tions of both Houses of Congress prior to
making any final changes to scoring metrics.
Only the impact on the small refinery’s
transportation fuel margins is pertinent to
measuring RFS impacts on relative refining
margins. The conference report accom-
panying the Energy and Water Development
and Related Agencies Appropriations Act,
2010, addressed similar issues and directed
the Secretary to redo an earlier study done
to evaluate whether the RFS program im-
poses a disproportionate economic hardship
on small refineries. In calling for the Sec-
retary to redo the study, the conference re-
port cited the lack of small refinery input
into the earlier study, concerns about re-
gional RFS compliance cost disparities,
small refinery dependence on the purchase of
renewable fuel credits (RINs), and increasing
RIN costs. Since then, the dramatic rise in
RIN prices has amplified RFS compliance
and competitive disparities, especially where
unique regional factors exist, including high
diesel demand production, no export access,
and limited biodiesel infrastructure and pro-
duction. In response to petitions in prior
years, the Secretary determined that the
RFS program would impose a dispropor-
tionate economic and structural impact on
several small refineries. Despite this deter-
mination, the Secretary did not recommend,
and EPA did not provide, any RFS relief be-
cause it determined the refineries were prof-
itable enough to afford the cost of RFS com-
pliance without substantially impacting
their viability. The Secretary is reminded
that the RFS program may impose a dis-
proportionate economic hardship on a small
refinery even if the refinery makes enough
profit to cover the cost of complying with
the program. Small refinery profitability
does not justify a disproportionate regu-
latory burden where Congress has explicitly
given EPA authority, in consultation with
the Secretary, to reduce or eliminate this
burden.
In lieu of Senate direction, the Department
is directed to provide to the Committees on
Appropriations of both Houses of Congress a

TITLE IV—INDEPENDENT AGENCIES
APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION
The agreement provides $155,000,000 for the
Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). To
diversify and enhance regional business de-
velopment, $10,000,000 is provided to continue
the program of high-speed broadband deploy-
ment in distressed counties within the Cen-
tral Appalachian region that have been most
negatively impacted by the downturn in the
coal industry. This funding shall be in addi-
tion to the 30 percent directed to distressed
counties.
Within available funds, $73,000,000 is pro-
vided for base funds and $50,000,000 is for the
POWER Initiative to support communities,
primarily in Appalachia, that have been ad-
versely impacted by the closure of coal-pow-
ered generating plants and a declining coal
industry by providing resources for economic
diversification, job creation, job training,
and other employment services.
Within available funds, not less than
$16,000,000 is provided for a program of indus-
trial site and workforce development in
Southern and South Central Appalachia, fo-
cused primarily on the automotive supplier
sector and the aviation sector. Up to
$13,500,000 of that amount is provided for ac-
tivities in Southern Appalachia. The funds
shall be distributed according to ARC’s Dis-
tressed Counties Formula, which is com-
prised of land area, population estimates,
and a proportion of the number of distressed
counties.
In addition, the agreement provides
$6,000,000 for a program of basic infrastruc-
ture improvements in distressed counties in
Central Appalachia. Funds shall be distrib-
uted according to ARC’s Distressed Counties
Formula and shall be in addition to the reg-
ular allocation to distressed counties.
DEFENSE NUCLEAR FACILITIES SAFETY BOARD
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement provides $31,000,000 for the
Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. The
agreement includes funding above the re-
quest to support activities for employee en-
gagement.
DELTA REGIONAL AUTHORITY
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement provides $25,000,000 for the
Delta Regional Authority (DRA). Within
available funds, the agreement provides not
less than $10,000,000 for flood control, basic
public infrastructure development, and
transportation improvements, which shall be
allocated separate from the State formula
funding method. The agreement does not in-
clude a statutory waiver with regard to
DRA’s priority of funding. The DRA is fur-
ther directed to focus on activities relating
to basic public infrastructure and transpor-
tation infrastructure before allocating fund-
ing toward other priority areas.
DENALI COMMISSION
The agreement provides $30,000,000 for the
Denali Commission, of which $15,000,000 is for
one-time assistance for adaptation responses
for the most urgent needs of rural Alaska
villages facing erosion, flooding, and perma-
frost degradation threats.
NORTHERN BORDER REGIONAL COMMISSION
The agreement provides $15,000,000 for the
Northern Border Regional Commission.
Within available funds, not less than
$3,000,000 is provided for initiatives that seek
to address the decline in forest-based econo-
mies throughout the region. The agreement
includes legislative language regarding the
management of the Northern Border Re-
gional Commission in fiscal year 2018.
SOUTHEAST CRESCENT REGIONAL COMMISSION
The agreement provides $250,000 for the
Southeast Crescent Regional Commission.
NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
(INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)
The Commission’s mission is to ensure the
safety and security of the nation’s use of nu-
clear power and nuclear materials and pro-
tect the workers and public who use and ben-
efit from these materials and facilities. The
agreement provides $909,137,000 for Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (Commission) sala-
ries and expenses. This amount is offset by
estimated revenues of $779,768,032, resulting
in a net appropriation of $129,300,892. The
agreement rescinds $68,076.04 provided to the
Commission from the United States Agency
for International Development in 1994 pursu-
ant to section 632(a) of the Foreign Assist-
ance Act of 1961, for which there is no cur-
rently authorized use. The agreement in-
cludes $10,000,000 for activities related to the
development of regulatory infrastructure for
advanced nuclear reactor technologies and
$16,200,000 for international activities, which
are not subject to the Commission’s general
fee recovery collection requirements. The
agreement directs the use of $15,000,000 in
prior-year unobligated balances.
The agreement includes the following di-
rection in lieu of all direction included in
the House and Senate reports:
Nuclear Reactor Safety.—The agreement
includes $466,655,000 for Nuclear Reactor
Safety. This control point includes the Com-
mission’s Operating Reactors and New Reac-
tors business lines.
Integrated University Program.—The
agreement includes $15,000,000 for the Inte-
grated University Program. Of this amount,
$5,000,000 is to be used for grants to support
projects that do not align with pro-
grammatic missions but are critical to main-
taining the discipline of nuclear science and
engineering.
Nuclear Materials and Waste Safety.—The
agreement includes $113,145,000 for Nuclear
Materials and Waste Safety. Included within
this control point are the Fuel Facilities,
Nuclear Material Users, and Spent Fuel
Storage and Transportation business lines.
Decommissioning and Low-Level Waste.—
The agreement includes $27,980,000 for De-
commissioning and Low-Level Waste.
Corporate Support.—The agreement in-
cludes $301,357,000 for Corporate Support. The
agreement provides, within available funds,
not more than $9,500,000 for the salaries,
travel, and other support costs for the Office
of the Commission. These salaries and ex-
penses shall include only salaries and benefit
and travel costs, and are not to include gen-
eral, administrative, or infrastructure costs.
The use and expenditure of these funds shall
be jointly managed through majority vote of
the Commission. The Commission shall con-
tinue to include a breakout and explanation
of the Commission salaries and expenses in
its annual budget requests. If the Commis-
sion wishes to change the composition of the
funds in future years, it must do so in an an-
nual budget request or through a reprogram-
ming.
Budget Execution Plan.—The Commission
shall provide a specific budget execution
plan to the Committees on Appropriations of
both Houses of Congress not later than 30
days after the enactment of this Act. The
plan shall include details at the product line
level within each of the control points.
Unobligated Balances from Prior Appro-
priations.—The Commission carries unobli-
gated balances from appropriations received
prior to fiscal year 2017. The agreement re-
quires the use of $15,000,000 of these balances,
derived from fee-based activities. The Com-
mission is directed to apply these savings in
a manner that continues to ensure the pro-
tection of public health and safety and main-
tains the effectiveness of the current inspec-
tion program. Because the Commission has
already collected fees corresponding to these
activities in prior years, the agreement does
not include these funds within the fee base
calculation for determining authorized reve-
nues and does not provide authority to col-
lect additional offsetting receipts for their
use. Any remaining unobligated balances
carried forward from prior years are subject
to the reprogramming guidelines in section
402 of the Act, and shall only be used to sup-
plement appropriations consistent with
those guidelines.
Rulemaking.—The Commission shall sub-
mit a list of all rulemaking activities
planned, to include their priority, schedule,
and actions taken to adhere to the backfit
rule, in the annual budget request and the
semi-annual report to Congress on licensing
and regulatory activities.
Reporting Requirements.—The agreement
directs the Commission to submit the fol-
lowing reports:
1. not later than 120 days after the enact-
ment of this Act, a report on the actions
taken to improve the fidelity of agency esti-
mates of necessary FTE levels and to opti-
mize the structure of the agency over the
next five years, including a review of the
size, function, and number of program offices
and regional offices; and
2. quarterly reports on licensing goals and
right-sizing commitments, as described in
the explanatory statement for P.L. 114–113.
Modeling and Simulation Tools.—The
Commission is directed to report to the Com-
mittees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress not later than 180 days after the en-
actment of this Act the Commission’s poten-
tial uses of the Consortium for Advanced
Simulation of Light Water Reactors’ tools in
its licensing process and safety reviews.

TIONS ACT, 2018
The joint explanatory statement accom-
panying this division is approved and indi-
cates congressional intent. Unless otherwise
noted, the language set forth in House Re-
port 115–234 carries the same weight as lan-
guage included in this joint explanatory
statement and should be complied with un-
less specifically addressed to the contrary in
this joint explanatory statement. While
some language is repeated for emphasis, it is
not intended to negate the language referred
to above unless expressly provided herein.
Reports.—Where the House or Senate has
directed submission of a report, that report
is to be submitted to the Committees on Ap-

cies funded by this Act that currently pro-
vide separate copies of periodic reports and

tees of both the House and the Senate. To

dite agency processing, and ensure that con-
sistent information is conveyed concurrently

H2544 March 22, 2018
DIVISION F—DEPARTMENT OF HOME-
LAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT,
2018
The following is an explanation of Division
F, which makes appropriations for the De-
partment of Homeland Security (DHS) for
fiscal year 2018. Funding provided in this Act
not only sustains existing programs that
protect the nation from all manner of
threats, it ensures DHS’s ability to improve
preparedness at the federal, state, and local
levels, to prevent and respond to terrorist at-
tacks, and to hire, train, and equip DHS
frontline forces protecting the homeland.
The language set forth in House Report
115–239 carries the same weight as language
included in this joint explanatory statement
and should be complied with unless specifi-
cally addressed to the contrary in the bill or
in this joint explanatory statement. While
the statement repeats some language for em-
phasis, it does not negate any language in
the House report unless expressly stated.
When this explanatory statement refers to
the Committees or the Committees on Ap-
propriations, these references are to the
House Appropriations Subcommittee on
Homeland Security and the Senate Appro-
priations Subcommittee on Homeland Secu-
rity.
This explanatory statement refers to cer-
tain laws, organizations, persons, funds, and
documents as follows: the Implementing
Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission
Act of 2007, Public Law 110–53, is referenced
as the 9/11 Act; the Robert T. Stafford Dis-
aster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act,
Public Law 93–288, is referenced as the Staf-
ford Act; the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity is referenced as DHS or the Department;
the Government Accountability Office is ref-
erenced as GAO; and the Office of Inspector
General of the Department of Homeland Se-
curity is referenced as OIG. In addition,
‘‘full-time equivalents’’ are referred to as
FTE; ‘‘full-time positions’’ are referred to as
FTP; ‘‘Information Technology’’ is referred
to as IT; the DHS ‘‘Working Capital Fund’’ is
referred to as WCF; ‘‘program, project, and
activity’’ is referred to as PPA; any ref-
erence to ‘‘the Secretary’’ should be inter-
preted to mean the Secretary of the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security; ‘‘component’’
should be interpreted to mean an agency, ad-
ministration, or directorate within the De-
partment of Homeland Security; and ‘‘budget
request’’ or ‘‘the request’’ should be inter-
preted to mean the budget of the U.S. Gov-
ernment for fiscal year 2018 that was sub-
mitted to Congress on May 23, 2017.
CLASSIFIED PROGRAMS
Recommended adjustments to classified
programs are addressed in a classified annex
to this joint explanatory statement.
TITLE I—DEPARTMENTAL MANAGE-
MENT, OPERATIONS, INTELLIGENCE,
AND OVERSIGHT
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY AND EXECUTIVE
MANAGEMENT
OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT
A total of $139,602,000 is provided for Oper-
ations and Support, including not more than
$30,000 for official reception and representa-
tion (ORR) expenses.
DHS is directed to continue to submit
quarterly obligation reports to the Commit-
tees for all ORR expenses and shall refrain
from using such funds for unnecessary col-
lectibles or memorabilia. A decrease of
$10,000 is assessed to the Secretary’s ORR
funds due to the assumption of $657,000,000 in
unauthorized fee revenue in the fiscal year
2018 budget request. The Department is di-
rected to work with the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget (OMB) to ensure that fu-
ture budget requests do not assume savings
from fee proposals that have not been au-
thorized. Bill language has been included to
require the Department to submit a budget
amendment to reduce spending commensu-
rate with any fee increase that has not been
authorized within 60 days of a proposal.
Based on technical assistance provided by
the Department, a reduction of $1,647,000 has
been distributed within the account to re-
flect more realistic hiring projections for the
remainder of the fiscal year.
The amount provided for this appropria-
tion by PPA is as follows:

Total, Office of the Secretary and Executive Management .................................................................................................................................................................................... $130,307,000 $139,602,000
The Department is directed to provide
complete justification materials in future
budget requests and to provide details for
each office and program, clearly describing
the funds necessary to continue current serv-
ices at the previous fiscal year level, all
transfers, any adjustments that have been
made to base funding, and all proposed pro-
gram changes.
The REAL ID program improves the secu-
rity of state identification materials. The
Secretary has the discretion to grant a state
additional time to meet the required min-
imum standards if the state provides ade-
quate justification for delayed compliance.
States should have the opportunity to con-
sider methods of compliance consistent with
individual state values and traditions.
DHS is engaged in a number of commend-
able efforts to end human trafficking and
child exploitation. Within 60 days of the date
of enactment of this Act, DHS shall brief the
Committees on component efforts to combat
human trafficking and child exploitation and
include the following information by compo-
nent and PPA: a comprehensive list of DHS
activities to identify, locate, and protect
children against exploitation; the metrics
used by DHS to track and evaluate these ac-
tivities; funding levels associated with these
activities; a comprehensive list of state,
local, international, and non-government
agency partners for these activities; the au-
thorities by which DHS is carrying out these
activities; additional authorities that would
improve DHS’s ability to carry out these ac-
tivities domestically or internationally; and
DHS’s progress toward meeting requirements
under Public Law 115–125.
The Department is expected to work in
partnership with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service to improve cooperative efforts to
better address wildlife trafficking, and to ex-
peditiously provide overdue reports on wild-
life trafficking to the Committees. In addi-
tion, an updated report on wildlife traf-
ficking, as outlined in the explanatory state-
ment accompanying Public Law 115–31, shall
be provided to the Committees not later
than November 15, 2018.
The recently completed northern border
threat analysis required by Public Law 114–
267 provides the Department with specific in-
formation on how best to target and deploy
resources along the northern border. The De-
partment is directed to implement the re-
port’s key recommendations as part of an
operationally focused strategy along the
northern border. Future budget requests
should detail specific northern border staff-
ing requirements and request funding for im-
plementation of planned northern border en-
forcement initiatives by field office.
Should the currently productive relation-
ship between DHS and GAO change, the
Committees shall be notified immediately.
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
A total of $18,846,000 is provided for the Of-
fice of the Secretary.
The Department shall continue to submit
quarterly Border Security Status reports
and data on the deportation of parents of
U.S.-born children semiannually, as in prior
years.
Airports, airlines, and industry have dem-
onstrated a strong willingness to engage
with U.S. Customs and Border Protection
(CBP) to develop concepts of operations and
technologies necessary to facilitate legiti-
mate travel while enhancing security. CBP’s
facial recognition technology pilot deploy-
ments at several airports, including
Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International
Airport and Washington Dulles International
Airport, and the ongoing expansion to air-
ports around the United States, have shown
great promise. In the near term, CBP is ex-
pected to obligate funding to build a back-
end communications portal to connect with
airlines; develop new software capabilities
that leverage one-to-many facial biometric
searching and matching; test and maintain
biometric equipment; and perform dem-
onstrations with airline participants for
entry in the air environment, and for entry
and exit in the land and vehicle pedestrian
environments. The Department is directed to
brief the Committees semiannually on ef-
forts to deploy entry and exit data collection
technologies in both the air and land border
environments, with the first such briefing
due not later than 90 days after the date of
enactment of this Act.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforce-
ment (ICE) continues to find success through
its Biometric Identification Transnational
Migration Alert Program, which involves bi-
ometric data collection from special interest
aliens, violent criminals, fugitives, and con-
firmed or suspected terrorists encountered

by foreign law enforcement and military per-
sonnel. The Department, in conjunction with
appropriate partner agencies, shall brief the
Committees not later than 90 days after the
date of enactment of this Act on these im-
portant efforts.
The rate of illegal border crossing slowed
significantly during 2017, but the efforts of
the Government of Mexico to secure its
southern border must remain an important
focus. Both the United States and Mexico
must continue working with the Govern-
ments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Hon-
duras to improve their civil law enforcement
capabilities, including by sharing criminal
history information, prior orders of removal,
and immigration enforcement actions. ICE’s
Criminal History Information Sharing agree-
ments with the Bahamas, the Dominican Re-
public, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,
and Jamaica continue to be productive, in
addition to ICE’s work with the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation’s Criminal Justice In-
formation System Advocacy Board to in-
crease the number of conviction codes that
are shared between nations. Not later than 90
days after the date of enactment of this Act,
the Department, in conjunction with the ap-
propriate components and partner agencies,
shall brief the Committees on these efforts,
including details on where any law enforce-
ment, coordination, or information sharing
gaps exist.
The Department’s Entry/Exit Overstay Re-
port for fiscal year 2016 revealed that, at the
end of that year, there were 628,799 individ-
uals who remained in the United States be-
yond their authorized period of stay and for
whom departure from the United States
could not be verified. The Department is di-
rected to develop and report within 180 days
of the date of enactment of this Act on a sta-
tistically sound metric for measuring the
total nonimmigrant air and sea overstay
population in the United States at a given
time. The report should also describe the
characteristics of suspected in-county
overstays and detail how the Department
will improve its collection and use of data
sets necessary to develop a more comprehen-
sive in-country alien overstay estimate. GAO
shall review the metric developed in this re-
port and provide a preliminary briefing to
the Committees on its review not later than
90 days after the report is provided to the
Committees.
The Department is further directed to de-
velop and publish a comprehensive in-coun-
try alien overstay enforcement and deter-
rence strategy not later than 240 days after
the date of enactment of this Act. This strat-
egy shall, at a minimum, establish a target
and range of options for reducing the over-
stay population and detail the resources and
assets that would be required to implement
the strategy.
The Department shall also report within
180 days of the date of enactment of this Act
on how to improve its collection and use of
data sets necessary to develop an estimate
for the entire population of those illegally
present in the United States. GAO shall re-
view this report and provide a preliminary
briefing to the Committees on its review not
later than 90 days after the report is pro-
vided to the Committees.
The Department’s reliance on sourcing per-
sonal protective equipment, organizational
clothing, and individual equipment from for-
eign manufacturers misses an opportunity to
support the U.S. manufacturing economy
while also enhancing security by using prod-
ucts made in America. The Secretary is di-
rected to take immediate steps to increase
the share of American-made products in its
procurements and to provide a report to the
Committees, not later than 180 days after
the date of enactment of this Act, on any ob-
stacles to the Department’s ability to transi-
tion to procuring 100 percent American-man-
ufactured goods. The report should also pro-
pose solutions to any such obstacles and de-
tail progress the Department is making to-
ward increasing its utilization of American
goods. Additionally, the Department shall
provide a report not later than 90 days after
the date of enactment of this Act on DHS’s
compliance with the Buy American Act and
Kissell Amendment, as detailed in the House
report.
The agreement includes $5,765,000, which is
$900,000 above the amount in the budget re-
quest, to enhance the Joint Requirements
Council’s (JRC) capacity for cross-compo-
nent requirements analysis and develop-
ment. DHS is directed to continue to provide
quarterly briefings on the JRC to the Com-
mittees. DHS should consider the impor-
tance of maintaining independence between
the requirements development and acquisi-
tion processes as part of this review. DHS is
directed to continue to provide quarterly
briefings on the JRC and shall brief the Com-
mittees on any reorganization of head-
quarters organizational units not later than
60 days before any such reorganization takes
place.
The Department is directed to provide a
briefing to the Committees, not later than
180 days after the date of enactment of this
Act, on the extent of persecution and vio-
lence against religious minorities in Indo-
nesia. The briefing shall include the manner
in which the Department coordinates with
the Departments of Justice and State to
comply with sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 and
the regulations promulgated pursuant to sec-
tion 2242(b) of the Foreign Affairs Reform
and Restructuring Act of 1998.
The Department is encouraged to continue
its efforts toward full implementation of the
Plan to Support Increased Public Access to
the Results of Research Funded published on
December 27, 2016. The Department is di-
rected to provide an update on progress made
in future budget requests.
Coordination among DHS agencies and
state, local, tribal, territorial, and foreign
law enforcement agencies, to include state
police crime labs, ensures the efficient use of
resources and improves public safety out-
comes. The Department should continue to
provide assistance, as appropriate, to state
police crime labs to ensure that federal re-
quirements do not burden state resources or
cause a backlog that slows investigations.
The Department shall report annually on its
use of and partnerships with state crime
labs, including funding associated with such
uses and partnerships, and should fully reim-
burse state crime labs for all provided serv-
ices.
OFFICE OF POLICY
A total of $40,524,000 is provided for the Of-
fice of Policy.
The agreement includes $4,787,400 to accel-
erate the build-out of the Immigration Data
Integration Initiative. This initiative con-
tinues departmental efforts directed by the
Committees on Appropriations in prior years
based on bipartisan, bicameral concerns
about the inability of the Department to
provide timely reporting of border security
and immigration enforcement data.
OFFICE OF PARTNERSHIP AND ENGAGEMENT
A total of $13,373,000 is provided for the Of-
fice of Partnership and Engagement.
The Blue Campaign, a department-wide
initiative to combat human trafficking, has
historically been operated by personnel de-
tailed from components and funded through
end-of-year contributions from components,
an approach that is not appropriate for the
program’s long-term sustainment. The Fis-
cal Year 2017 DHS Appropriations Act in-
cluded direct funding of $819,000 for the Blue
Campaign to support dedicated personnel, as
requested, and to begin transitioning the
program away from reliance on component
contributions. Unfortunately, the fiscal year
2018 request proposed no direct funding for
the program. The fiscal year 2018 bill again
includes $819,000, the full level authorized
under Public Law 115–125, in continued direct
funding for personnel. DHS is directed to
sustain the program at not less than its total
fiscal year 2016 level of $5,150,000 in fiscal
year 2018 using component contributions to
cover non-personnel program costs. DHS
shall account for and propose full, direct
funding for the program in the justification
materials that accompany all future budget
submissions, as directed in the explanatory
statement accompanying Public Law 115–31.
A directive is included under the heading
for the Office of the Secretary for DHS to
brief the Committees on the status of the on-
going DHS effort to review roles, responsibil-
ities, and the potential reorganization of
headquarters elements, which should include
an assessment of the appropriate organiza-
tional placement for the Blue Campaign.
The Department is directed to assess ways
it can better understand rural issues as they
relate to the homeland security mission and
how rural communities are impacted by the
Department’s decisions. Not later than 180
days after the date of enactment of this Act,
the Department shall brief the Committees
on this assessment, component best prac-
tices, and the potential advantages of estab-
lishing a rural advocate position at the de-
partment level.
OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES
A total of $23,571,000 is provided for the Of-
fice for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties
(OCRCL). Funding provided above the re-
quest is to accommodate the increased work-
load expected in fiscal year 2018 resulting
from new executive orders. OCRCL shall
maintain its independence as it continues to
help departmental components ensure their
compliance with civil rights and civil lib-
erties laws and policies.
PRIVACY OFFICE
A total of $8,464,000 is provided for the Pri-
vacy Office. Funding above the request is to
accommodate an increased workload in fis-
cal year 2018 resulting from new immigra-
tion-related executive orders, policies, and
programs. Further, the additional funds are
available to ensure information and data re-
leased by the Department does not reveal the
identity or personally identifiable informa-
tion of non-citizens who may be survivors of
domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking,
human trafficking, or other crimes. The Pri-
vacy Office must ensure the Department’s
actions do not violate the Privacy Act, the
Violence Against Women Act, or other laws.
The Privacy Office is directed to provide a
briefing to the Committees within 60 days of
the date of enactment of this Act on the
measures the Department will take to ensure
all record systems properly restrict informa-
tion related to survivors of domestic vio-
lence, sexual assault, stalking, human traf-
ficking, and other crimes.
MANAGEMENT DIRECTORATE
OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT
A total of $710,297,000 is provided for Oper-
ations and Support. Within the total,
$227,516,000 is available until September 30,
2019, to include $36,368,000 for the Chief Read-
iness Support Officer, $188,217,000 for the
Chief Information Officer (CIO), and
$2,931,000 for headquarters operations at the
Nebraska Avenue Complex. Based on tech-
nical assistance provided by the Department,
a reduction of $5,047,000 has been distributed

IMMEDIATE OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY
FOR MANAGEMENT
A total of $6,770,000 is provided for the Im-
mediate Office of the Under Secretary for
Management.
The Secretary is reminded that the explan-
atory statement accompanying the Fiscal
Year 2017 Homeland Security Appropriations
Act directed the Department to establish a
Public Complaint and Feedback System
Working Group comprised of representatives
of DHS components with public-facing oper-
ations. The purpose of the group should be to
support the sharing of best practices and, as
appropriate, the standardization of feedback
mechanisms, processes, customer service
metrics, and reporting across the Depart-
ment. The working group was directed to:
1. Develop a DHS-wide ‘‘as-is’’ assessment
of the various public complaint and feedback
intake and resolution processes and systems
currently in place, to include an evaluation
of the public’s awareness of how to success-
fully provide feedback to DHS, along with
component-level policies, practices, and ca-
pabilities for providing timely responses, re-
porting results, and incorporating feedback
into policy development and training;
2. Research best practices for public feed-
back intake, processing, resolution, and re-
porting, as well as for improving public
awareness of the process;
3. Identify gaps and redundancies within
each component’s processes and systems;
4. Develop and disseminate guidance that
communicates requirements for component-
level public complaint and feedback intake
and resolution systems, processes, and re-
porting capabilities;
5. Establish processes for centrally com-
piling and reporting component-level public
complaint and feedback data at the depart-
ment level; and
6. Determine whether aspects of the overall
DHS public complaint and feedback process
should be supported with headquarters re-
sources.
Not later than 90 days after the date of en-
actment of this Act, the Department shall
brief the Committees on the working group’s
findings and progress, including a plan and
schedule for carrying out all of the activities
described above. In addition, the Department
shall continue to report to the Committees
semiannually on the working group’s
progress until each of the assigned tasks are
complete.
Within the amount recommended for the
Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer
(OCHCO) is $4,200,000 to continue the Cyber-
security Internship Program. OCHCO is di-
rected to ensure that these funds are fully
used for the intended purpose and to update
the Committees on the status of the program
by September 30, 2018. This update should in-
clude the number of internship applications
for the fiscal year 2018 cohort; the number of
internships offered and accepted; the rate of
acceptance; a description of the Depart-
ment’s efforts to publicize the availability of
these internship opportunities, with a par-
ticular focus on outreach to underrep-
resented populations; and options for im-
proving such outreach.
The Under Secretary for Management
(USM) is directed to conduct a study on the
feasibility of establishing an initiative to
employ Native American veterans within the
ranks of CBP, including the potential cre-
ation of a tribal-specific branch of the Bor-
der Patrol. Specifically, the study should
evaluate how the hiring of Native American
veterans could leverage tribal authorities to
complement CBP authorities in support of
the Border Patrol mission. In conducting
this study, the USM should solicit input
from tribes located along both the southern
and northern borders. The results of this
study shall be submitted to the Committees
not later than 180 days after the date of en-
actment of this Act.
OFFICE OF THE CHIEF READINESS SUPPORT
OFFICER
A total of $71,105,000 is provided for the Of-
fice of the Chief Readiness Support Officer.
Effectively tracking, managing, and main-
taining tactical communications assets re-
quires appropriate governance programs and
infrastructure. In lieu of related House re-
port language, the Department shall brief
the Committees not later than 60 days after
the date of enactment of this Act on plans to
modernize tactical communications and ve-
hicles across the Department, including
those directly affecting the missions of U.S.
Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immi-
gration and Customs Enforcement, and the
United States Secret Service.
Within 180 days of the date of enactment of
this Act, DHS is directed to conduct a review
of component fleet utilization and to provide
OIG with supporting documentation on
methods used for determining optimal fleet
inventories and justification for any devi-
ation from GSA’s Federal Property Manage-
ment Regulations.
OFFICE OF THE CHIEF HUMAN CAPITAL OFFICER
A total of $71,052,000 is provided for the Of-
fice of the Chief Human Capital Officer,
which includes an additional $10,000,000 for
the Cyber Statutory Authority Program.
OFFICE OF THE CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER
A total of $74,963,000 is provided for the Of-
fice of the Chief Security Officer, to include
an increase of $1,764,000 for Office of Per-
sonnel Management security clearance in-
vestigations.
OFFICE OF THE CHIEF PROCUREMENT OFFICER
A total of $102,615,000 is provided for the Of-
fice of the Chief Procurement Officer includ-
ing $2,493,000 for the DHS Data Framework.
Based on required congressional notifica-
tions, it is evident that departmental compo-
nents enter into contracts near the end of
the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal
year at a much higher rate than at other
times throughout the year. The Depart-
ment’s continued practice of awarding a
large number of contracts late in the fiscal
year remains concerning, particularly for
contracts related to OMB object classes 25.1,
25.2, 25.3, and 26.
The Department has indicated that
planned obligations by object class described
in the annual Budget Appendix may not ac-
curately predict actual spending during the
budget year due to variances between the
budget request and enacted appropriations.
Planned and actual spending appear to vary
more than would be expected, however, if it
were due only to changes between requested
and appropriated amounts, when appropria-
tions are enacted, or changes in planning as-
sumptions that emerge during execution.
Not later than 90 days after the date of en-
actment of this Act, the Department shall
provide to the Committees revised spending
plans for all Operations and Support ac-
counts and the Coast Guard Operating Ex-
penses account for each of these object class-
es, including planned contract obligations by
fiscal quarter, as part of the quarterly obli-
gation plans. For contracts in excess of
$1,000,000, the plan should also detail planned
contract amounts, provide brief contract re-
quirement descriptions, describe whether the
contract is for a new requirement, and ex-
plain whether the contract will meet bona
fide requirements for the current or next fis-
cal year. The Department will ensure the
final obligation plan report for fiscal year
2018 includes data on actual contract awards
and describes the factors behind any signifi-
cant variances between the revised spending
plan and actual contract awards.
OFFICE OF THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
A total of $63,734,000 is provided for the Of-
fice of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO).
In keeping with past practice, annual
budget justifications shall include the text
and citation of all Department appropria-
tions provisions enacted to date that are per-
manent law.
While the new Common Appropriations
Structure provides additional financial flexi-
bility, DHS shall continue to aggressively in-
stitute financial management policies and
procedures, particularly as they relate to
budget formulation.
In lieu of related House report guidance,
the OCFO shall provide a briefing to the
Committees on recommended periods of
availability and PPA structures for DHS and
component appropriations accounts within
45 days of the date of enactment of this Act.
OFFICE OF THE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER
A total of $320,058,000 is provided for the Of-
fice of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO).
The OCIO is to be commended for its lead-
ership in data center consolidation, which is
enhancing the effectiveness, efficiency, and
security of the DHS IT enterprise. The OCIO
is further commended for its efforts to col-
laborate with the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration to gain efficiencies by
establishing IT operations centers at Data
Center 1 and by encouraging other federal
partners to co-locate at DHS data centers.
The OCIO shall provide semiannual briefings
on the execution of its major initiatives and
investment areas, with the first such brief-
ing to occur not later than 90 days after the
date of enactment of this Act. These brief-
ings shall include details regarding cost,
schedule, and the transfer of systems to or
from DHS data centers or external hosts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2548 March 22, 2018
Within 90 days of the date of enactment of
this Act, CBP is directed to brief the Com-
mittees on a comprehensive, multi-year re-
cruitment and retention strategy that in-
cludes: an analysis of the screening process
for prospective staff, including polygraph ex-
aminations; current and planned hiring and
retention initiatives executed by both fed-
eral and contract staff; options to address
pay parity relative to other components and
other federal law enforcement agencies; the
potential use of special pays to improve re-
tention; the use of incentives available
through the Office of Personnel Management
to recruit, relocate, and retain employees as-
signed to remote locations; and potential
new career path enhancements for personnel
who choose such locations. CBP is encour-
aged to work with community, local, and
tribal colleges to assist with recruitment ef-
forts. In addition, CBP should continue col-
laborating with the Department of Defense,
as required by the Border Jobs for Veterans
Act (Public Law 114–68), to facilitate the re-
cruitment of personnel exiting the military.
While the staffing requirement for Office of
Field Operations (OFO) CBP officers is well
understood, CBP has not yet finalized a
staffing model to inform the hiring of either
Border Patrol agents or Air and Marine Op-
erations (AMO) personnel. The budget re-
quest for new Border Patrol agents, in par-
ticular, was not supported by any analysis of
workload and capability gaps across CBP
that would be necessary to evaluate the ben-
efits of the proposal as compared to other in-
vestments at CBP, such as hiring additional
CBP officers at the ports of entry (POEs).
CBP is directed to brief the Committees
quarterly on its progress toward developing
a comprehensive assessment of CBP-wide ca-
pability gaps, with the first briefing due not
later than 60 days after the date of enact-
ment of this Act.
Not later than 30 days after the end of each
month, CBP shall post on its website a com-
bined table of currency and major categories
of drugs, including fentanyl, interdicted by
OFO and the Border Patrol, including a sepa-
rate accounting of Border Patrol drug inter-
dictions at checkpoints. Reported quantities
should be expressed using the same unit of
measurement.
Prior to the completion of a Border Patrol
staffing model that can allocate agents
based on risk, the Border Patrol is directed
to maintain not less than its previously de-
termined minimal staffing presence of 2,212
agents along the northern border. CBP shall
also take into special consideration direct-
ing a significant proportion of any overall
increase in CBP officer positions funded in
this Act to understaffed POEs in remote and
rural locations.
As part of its personnel recruitment and
retention efforts for hard-to-fill locations,
CBP is directed to conduct a feasibility
study on opportunities to help make high-
speed Internet service options available at
CBP-owned residential properties where they
are currently limited or lacking. CBP shall
prioritize particularly remote locations
along the northern and southern borders for
this effort and include in its analysis loca-
tions where high-speed Internet options are
currently available, could potentially be
made available through partnerships with
nearby service providers, and where there
are currently no nearby high-speed Internet
providers. CBP shall consult with residents
and their families throughout the course of
the study and update the Committees on op-
tions for increasing the availability of serv-
ices. Up to $500,000 is made available in this
Act to carry out the study.
CBP is directed to evaluate the charters,
reporting structures, and standard operating
procedures for the Border Patrol, OFO, and
AMO and institute any changes necessary to
ensure that CBP components are efficiently
coordinating and that personnel and assets
are deployed as efficiently and effectively as
possible to combat cross-border threats. CBP
shall brief the Committees on the results of
this evaluation within 90 days of the date of
enactment of this Act and quarterly there-
after.
In line with GAO’s recommendations in-
cluded in GAO–17–765T, CBP is directed to
develop robust performance metrics for all
deployed border security technologies; begin
the collection of performance data to evalu-
ate the individual and collective contribu-
tions of specific technologies; assess progress
in fully deploying planned technologies; and
determine when mission benefits from such
deployments have been fully realized.
CBP is directed to work with counties
along the U.S.-Mexico border to identify un-
improved county roads that are predomi-
nately used by the Border Patrol and that
provide critical access to the border region
for the purpose of maintaining security. CBP
is urged to incorporate the maintenance and
repair of the identified high-priority access
roads into its Tactical Infrastructure Main-
tenance and Repair program.
In lieu of direction in the House report,
CBP shall provide a briefing on border secu-
rity operations and technology operations
and procurement, including but not limited
to the following:
1. The results of the ongoing demonstra-
tion efforts and planned procurements for
small unmanned aerial systems (UAS);
2. A review of fiber-optic technologies, to
include the feasibility and potential benefits
of incorporating them into border security
systems;
3. An update on carrizo cane control ef-
forts, as described in the House report;
4. Details of search and rescue efforts dur-
ing fiscal year 2017, as described in the House
report; and
5. The status of the field test and recapi-
talization plan for the Tethered Aerostat
Radar System.
BORDER SECURITY OPERATIONS
The total includes $4,395,843,000 for Border
Security Operations. This amount includes
increases above the request for the following:
$20,000,000 for vehicles; $3,000,000 for the elec-
tronic geospatial information system, as de-
tailed in the House report; and $10,000,000
above the request for small UAS. Despite sig-
nificant investments in hiring, retention and
recruitment strategies, CBP estimates that
the Border Patrol will lose more agents than
will be gained in fiscal year 2018, and these
reduced payroll costs are reflected in the
bill.
TRADE AND TRAVEL OPERATIONS
The total includes $4,314,242,000 for Trade
and Travel Operations. This amount includes
$7,655,000 for 328 new CBP officers, reflecting
the partial year costs of anticipated new
CBP officers, $23,000,000 for POE technology
and facilities, and $30,500,000 for opioid detec-
tion equipment and labs. The recommenda-
tion does not include the proposal to redirect
fee revenue that currently supports the
Brand USA program to CBP for its trade and
travel activities; this proposal requires legal
authorization that is not under the jurisdic-
tion of the Committees.
Recent public dialogue on border security
has focused on the flow of undocumented
aliens and illicit drugs across the southern
border of the United States between the
POEs. As borne out by DHS data on the il-
licit movement of people and goods, how-
ever, border security investments must also
be made at the POEs, where between 80 and
90 percent of hard drugs are interdicted. As
compared to fiscal year 2016, seizures of hard
narcotics in fiscal year 2017—including co-
caine, methamphetamine, and fentanyl—
have risen over 10 percent, with the seizure
of fentanyl more than doubling at the
POEs.—In addition, the growth of illegal on-
line marketplaces, notably those on the
‘‘dark web,’’ make higher potency narcotics
increasingly accessible to American con-
sumers.
CBP is working to address this growing
threat at its International Mail Facilities
through the use of canines trained to detect
opioids, the deployment of new non-intrusive
inspection technologies, improved informa-
tion sharing, and additional personnel, but—
more work and investments are needed. In
addition, the Department must better ar-
ticulate the role and plans for expansion of
the National Targeting Center (NTC), includ-
ing how it will coordinate with and com-
plement the work of the recently-announced
National Vetting Center.
It is the role of the Committees to ensure
that DHS comprehensively evaluates
vulnerabilities at POEs; formulates stra-
tegic, risk-based goals to address those
vulnerabilities; and makes investments ac-
cordingly. Within 180 days of the date of en-
actment of this Act, CBP is directed to
produce a multi-year strategic plan for miti-
gating vulnerabilities and filling capability
gaps at POEs while improving the flow of
commerce. The plan shall include clear goals
and metrics, an implementation schedule,
and cost estimates. More specifically, the
plan shall address the following:
(1) Measuring Border Security at the Ports
of Entry:—Headquarters-driven definitions
and metrics to measure success at POEs de-
veloped through a capability gap analysis
process approved by the Executive Assistant
Commissioner of OFO and informed by the
Field Operations Directors.
(2) Focus Areas: A scope reflecting the full
breadth of agency authorities and respon-
sibilities at the POEs, including at a min-
imum the programs identified in the Fiscal
Year 2017 Border Security Improvement
Plan, along with the following:
a. A counternarcotics strategy, to include
e-commerce threats;
b. A counter-network strategy;
c. The biometric entry-exit system;
d. Trade and travel facilitative programs,
including the Automated Commercial Envi-
ronment;
e. Agricultural inspection programs; and
f. Trusted traveler programs at air, sea,
and land POEs.
(3) Associated Requirements: Accom-
panying requirements through fiscal year
2022, including:
a. Life cycle cost estimates for all tech-
nology equipment categories, including pro-
curement quantities and costs, and oper-
ations and maintenance costs; and
b. Any new legal authorities necessary for
implementing the plan.
Any analysis to assess and improve hiring
practices and procedures should reflect and
meet the needs of large U.S. international
airports with high numbers of international
tourist enplanements that do not share a
contiguous land border with Mexico or Can-
ada. Any resulting staffing decisions must be
transparent and impartial.
CBP shall brief the Committees within 120
days of the date of enactment of this Act on
how it allocates personnel between passenger
and cargo inspection functions at maritime
ports and on proposed solutions for address-
ing persistent staff shortages that lead to in-
creased annual costs for such ports and af-
filiated local governments.
CBP’s fee-for-service regime was originally
meant to facilitate international passengers
who depart or arrive from small airports.—In
some instances, however, fee-for-service has

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2549
March 22, 2018
been used for many years by some medium-
sized airports that have a consistently large
volume of international passengers, despite
failed attempts to receive POE designa-
tion.—This situation is of particular concern
because these airports’ passengers are essen-
tially charged twice for the same service—
once through federal fees paid when their
airline tickets are purchased, and again
through the CBP fee-for-service costs that
are charged directly to airports and inevi-
tably passed on to passengers. To determine
whether a fee-for-service airport can be des-
ignated as a POE, CBP relies on a series of
Treasury Directives promulgated decades
ago when the then-U.S. Customs Service was
part of the Treasury Department.—CBP is
urged to address this issue by giving priority
consideration to an application for POE sta-
tus submitted by any commercial airport if
such airport served at least 90,000 inter-
national passengers, not including those ar-
riving through a preclearance location, dur-
ing the previous calendar year.
The agreement directs CBP to consider
modifying relevant policies and operations
regarding small airport inspection services
at general aviation facilities currently used
by CBP for intermittent international clear-
ance operations, and to work creatively with
airports, including Green Bay-Austin
Straubel International Airport, to facilitate
international service in a manner consistent
with CBP security and resource require-
ments and informed by these airports’ fiscal
constraints and existing facilities.
The fiscal year 2013 CBP Resource Optimi-
zation Report estimated that the deploy-
ment of automated scheduling and
timekeeping solutions by OFO could return
158 CBP Officers and Agricultural Specialists
to their frontline inspection and law enforce-
ment duties. CBP shall evaluate commer-
cially-available automated scheduling tools,
brief the Committees on the results of the
evaluation within 90 days of the date of en-
actment of this Act, and deploy such solu-
tions if it is determined that their benefits
outweigh their costs.
CBP is directed to consult with affected
community members, industry representa-
tives, and elected officials at all levels prior
to making permanent changes to hours of
service at POEs and to notify the Commit-
tees at least 30 days in advance of such
changes.
CBP and the Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) continue to collaborate through
the Commercial Targeting and Analysis Cen-
ter to enhance shrimp-related targeting and
inspection processes to ensure that shrimp
imported to the United States are safe. Sen-
ate Report 114–264 directed CBP to carry out
a shrimp safety pilot project, which is ex-
pected to suggest additional opportunities
for enhanced CBP and FDA coordination to
improve imported shrimp safety. CBP is di-
rected to brief the Committees semiannually
on these activities.
CBP shall continue timely tracking and re-
porting on Jones Act waivers and violations,
notifying the Committees within two days of
waiver requests and on the disposition of
each waiver request and making this infor-
mation available to the public on a quarterly
basis.
Firearms and illicit monetary instruments
continue to be smuggled from the U.S. into
Mexico, fueling transnational criminal orga-
nization activities, including drug traf-
ficking and violent crime. CBP shall con-
tinue to collaborate with domestic and inter-
national partners to identify and apprehend
smugglers of firearms and undeclared mone-
tary instruments greater than $10,000, and
shall report to Congress on any additional
authorities or resources needed to stymie
the flow.
CBP is directed to continue working with
Great Lakes seaports, cruise vessel opera-
tors, and other Great Lakes Cruise Program
stakeholders to develop a cruise passenger
clearance plan for 2018 and thereafter. CBP
shall continue using mobile onboard pas-
senger clearance technology until such time
as that plan has been implemented, and shall
provide the Committees with a briefing, not
later than 90 days after the date of enact-
ment of this Act, detailing its stakeholder
engagement efforts and outlining its plan
and schedule for resolving this issue.
CBP is directed to develop a succession
plan to ensure that at least one person of ap-
propriate rank is located in each state at all
times to enforce customs, immigration, and
agricultural laws and regulations at U.S.
POEs. If CBP determines that it is not prac-
ticable to meet this requirement, CBP shall
notify the Committees in writing not later
than 60 days before any staffing decision is
finalized. Such notifications shall include a
fulsome explanation of why the change is
needed, an estimate of the number of pas-
sengers and amount of goods that would be
diverted elsewhere during a lapse, and the re-
sultant economic impact on the state.
The total includes $10,000,000 for the Com-
mercial Technology Innovation Program,
through which new commercial technologies
that may significantly improve POE oper-
ations are deployed along southwest border
POEs. CBP is directed to brief the Commit-
tees on the performance of this program and
any related pilots or initiatives not later
than 90 days after the date of enactment of
this Act.
CBP is encouraged to continue to work
with the General Services Administration
and OMB on the annual five-year land border
POE construction plan, which should include
plans to complete modernization of POEs
along the northern border built prior to 1980,
and provide the plan to the Committees upon
its completion. In developing this plan, spe-
cific attention shall be paid to the health,
safety, and welfare needs of CBP officers.
CBP is also encouraged to increase aware-
ness and use of the NEXUS program along
the Canadian border, including through spe-
cial enrollment events and the use of col-
laborative signage in cooperation with state
transportation agencies. The five-year con-
struction plan should also anticipate and re-
flect increased traffic that will result from
higher rates of NEXUS participation.
The bill authorizes the obligation of funds
for preclearance activities, including obliga-
tions in advance of reimbursement, as au-
thorized by the Trade Facilitation and Trade
Enforcement Act of 2015 (TFTEA). With Can-
ada’s adoption of companion legislation,
CBP is expected to begin negotiation with
the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)
on expanding preclearance activities in Can-
ada.
The Department is directed to prioritize
implementation of expanded preclearance
operations between the U.S. and Canada for
land, marine, rail, and air entries, as out-
lined in the ‘‘Beyond the Border Action
Plan.’’ CBP shall collaborate closely with
CBSA to ensure that plans for preclearance
operations at Billy Bishop Toronto City Air-
port, Québec City Jean Lesage International
Airport, Montréal rail, and Rocky Moun-
taineer rail proceed with an understanding
that operations must meet all terms and
conditions of the agreement. CBP should
continue to routinely reassess the security
benefits of both existing and prospective
preclearance agreements.
CBP is encouraged to continue prioritizing
efforts to improve the accuracy and effec-
tiveness of automated cargo processing for
tractor trailers, including the proof-of-con-
cept pilot at the World Trade Bridge Port of
Entry in Laredo, Texas. Not later than 120
days after the date of enactment of this Act,
CBP is directed to provide a report to the
Committees on these efforts, including ac-
tivities planned for fiscal year 2018 and the
subsequent four fiscal years.
As license plate reader technology used to
analyze vehicular traffic crossing land bor-
ders nears the end of its useful life, CBP
should continue to improve land border inte-
gration by deploying the latest, most effec-
tive vehicle monitoring technologies.
A total of $211,797,000 is provided for Tar-
geting Operations. CBP’s pre-arrival tar-
geting capabilities have expanded rapidly,
with base resources dedicated to these ac-
tivities growing from $51,950,000 in fiscal
year 2013 to more than $128,000,000 in fiscal
year 2017. While the expansion of analytical
capabilities at the NTC has been swift, the
proliferation of new tools and corresponding
contracts has shifted focus away from tradi-
tional trade, customs, and immigration law
enforcement targeting activities. CBP
should analyze and measure the benefits of
current activities and enhancements to im-
prove targeting against investments else-
where within the agency and the Depart-
ment. CBP shall brief the Committees within
90 days of the date of enactment of this Act
on current and proposed targeting metrics
and milestones, impacts on frontline staffing
requirements, and the proposed end state for
these activities.
The total includes $234,201,000 for the Office
of Trade. This amount includes $8,943,000 for
additional staff and core trade mission en-
hancements, including improved data anal-
ysis and visualization capabilities to im-
prove CBP’s effectiveness within the global
supply chain while also addressing mandates
of TFTEA in a timely manner. CBP shall
continue reporting on its trade enforcement
activities, as detailed in Senate Report 114–
264, shall post as much detail from the report
as is reasonable on its public website, and
shall include details on the implementation
of Executive Order 13785, Establishing En-
hanced Collection and Enforcement of Anti-
dumping and Countervailing Duties and Vio-
lations of Trade and Customs Laws.
TFTEA made changes to the treatment of
drawbacks, through which duties, taxes, and
fees on certain imported merchandise can be
refunded when the merchandise is subse-
quently exported or destroyed, or when sub-
stitute merchandise is exported in its place.
Among those changes, certain U.S.-produced
alcoholic beverages and paper products, as
described in Senate Report 114–264, became
eligible for substitution as exports for un-
used merchandise drawback claims. CBP is
directed to consult with the Alcohol and To-
bacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) and to
clarify the requirements for recovering du-
ties, taxes, and fees imposed under federal
law (with emphasis on federal excise taxes)
on imported alcohol products when alcohol
produced in the United States and classified
under the same eight or ten digit subheading
of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the
United States is exported as a substitute.
This clarification should describe how CBP
treats alcoholic beverages used as substitute
merchandise for the drawback of federal ex-
cise taxes on unused merchandise when ex-
ported from TTB bonded facilities, where
federal excise taxes have not been collected.
INTEGRATED OPERATIONS
The total includes $1,065,979,000 for Inte-
grated Operations, to include increases above
the request of $15,000,000 for UAS upgrades
and $3,000,000 for special pays for recruit-
ment and retention of AMO personnel.

Program, low-flying aircraft detection cov-
erage gaps along the northern border remain
a national security threat. Within 180 days
after the date of enactment of this Act, AMO
is directed to provide the Committees with
short-term deployment plans for low-flying
aircraft detection along the northern border.
These plans shall incorporate the anticipated
implementation schedule for the SENSR pro-
gram and acquisition and deployment sched-
ules for interim technology or asset use.
CBP shall continue to evaluate the poten-
tial for using commercial service providers
to provide pilots for UAS. In addition, CBP is
directed to work with the Federal Aviation
Administration to evaluate the feasibility
and benefits of cross-certifying pilots to fly
both manned aircraft and UAS.
In order to upgrade CBP’s UAS fleet to a
single configuration, $15,000,000 is included
above the request that shall be used only to
perform configuration upgrades. Within 60
days of the date of enactment of this Act,
CBP is directed to brief the Committees on
the results of its evaluation of whether addi-
tional UAS flight hours are necessary to sup-
port border security operations.

The total includes $1,709,100,000 for Mission
Support. This amount includes $10,000,000
above the request for recruitment and reten-
tion efforts.

HOMELAND SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS
Domestic Investigations. A total of
$1,898,542,000 is provided for Domestic Inves-
tigations. ICE is directed to sustain enhance-
ments provided in the fiscal year 2017 appro-
priations Act for programs and activities of
congressional interest as directed in the ex-
planatory statement accompanying Public
Law 115–31.
Funding is provided within the total to

Child Exploitation Investigations Unit at the
Cyber Crimes Center, along with an addi-
tional enhancement of not less than
$5,000,000. Funding is also provided to sustain
fiscal year 2017 enhancements to the Angel
Watch Center and continued implementation
of International Megan’s Law, along with an
additional enhancement of not less than
$5,000,000. ICE is directed to brief the Com-
mittees on a plan for the expenditure of
these funds not later than 60 days after the
date of enactment of this Act.
The total includes $2,000,000 for Homeland
Security Investigations (HSI) to establish a

(HERO) Corps’ work on the above investiga-
tions. ICE is directed to report to the Com-
mittees not later than 180 days after the date
of enactment of this Act on the development,
implementation, planned milestones, fund-
ing, and staffing requirements for fiscal
years 2018 and 2019 for this pilot. The report
shall also address this pilot’s potential for
expansion to principal HSI domestic offices
to support investigations related to child ex-
ploitation, opioid and fentanyl smuggling,
and other cybercrimes.
ICE is directed to provide a briefing on op-
tions for establishing paid HERO apprentice-
ships not later than 30 days after the date of
enactment of this Act. ICE should continue
to train at least two classes of HEROs annu-
ally and should employ HERO graduates at
ICE or help place them with other agencies
or organizations with related missions, as
appropriate.
The total includes not less than $305,000 for
promoting public awareness of the child por-
nography tip line and not less than
$15,770,000 for investigations of forced labor
law violations, to include forced child labor.
ICE is directed to continue to submit an an-
nual report on expenditures and performance
metrics associated with forced labor law en-
forcement activities.
ICE is directed to continue prioritizing ef-
forts to investigate, remove, and prosecute
individuals who have committed human
rights abuses, including persecution, geno-
cide, severe violations of religious freedom,
torture, extrajudicial killing, use or recruit-
ment of child soldiers, crimes against hu-
manity, or war crimes.
ICE’s Tactical Intelligence Center (TIC)
plays an important role in combating the il-
licit movement of people and goods into the
United States through the Gulf of Mexico
and has a particular focus on maritime drug
smuggling and transnational criminal net-
works. The Department is directed to evalu-
ate whether it could better leverage the ac-
tivities of other DHS components and other
federal and non-federal entities in the region
with related missions through the establish-
ment of a Regional Intelligence Integration
Center more broadly focused on the collec-
tion, analysis, and coordination of intel-
ligence related to ICE’s Gulf Coast enforce-
ment mission.
International Investigations. The total in-
cludes $169,178,000 for International Inves-
tigations, including $1,286,000 for five HSI
agents. This amount includes an increase
above the request of $18,000,000 to annualize
the costs of prior-year expansions to the
Visa Security Program (VSP) and to expand
the program to new high priority locations.
ICE shall continue to expand the VSP where
operationally feasible at high-threat posts
abroad and shall ensure that support for this
sustained level of operations and growth is
included in annual budget requests.
ICE shall allocate not less than $5,300,000
for war crime investigations, including but
not limited to training, transportation, and
hiring of additional personnel at the Office
of the Principal Legal Advisor Human Rights
Law Section and the HSI Human Rights Vio-
lators and War Crimes Unit.
The report on the use of International Mo-
bile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) catchers
mandated in Senate Report 114–264 was re-
ceived December 28, 2017. While it addressed
the use of IMSI catchers and similar tech-
nologies in general terms, it lacked the spec-
ificity directed in the reporting requirement.
ICE is directed to provide specific details for
each of the cases referenced in the report in
which IMSI catchers and related tech-
nologies were used by ICE to apprehend an
individual, and providing brief descriptions
for each of the times IMSI catchers and re-
lated technologies were used to gather evi-
dence relevant to a case against an appre-
hended individual. These details and descrip-
tions should only provide information about
the purpose or cause of the individuals’ ap-
prehension and how IMSI catchers were used.
In no case should these descriptions contain
personally identifiable information.
ENFORCEMENT AND REMOVAL OPERATIONS
The total includes $4,110,337,000 for En-
forcement and Removal Operations (ERO).
Between October 1, 2017, and the date of en-
actment of this Act, when the Department
was operating under the terms of a con-
tinuing resolution (CR), ICE exceeded its
annualized rate of funding for Custody Oper-
ations. During the period of any future CR,
including any CR for fiscal year 2019, ICE is
directed to manage its resources in a way
that ensures it will not exceed the
annualized rate of funding for the fiscal year.
ICE is directed to update the Committees
weekly on its rate of operations for Custody
Operations to demonstrate how the agency is
living within its means.
ICE officials have stated publicly that en-
forcement actions at sensitive locations—
identified as schools, healthcare facilities,
places of worship, religious or civil cere-
monies or observances, and public dem-
onstrations—should generally be avoided,
and its policy requires either prior approval
from an appropriate supervisory official or
exigent circumstances necessitating imme-
diate action. ICE is expected to continue to
follow this policy and to work with state and
local law enforcement officials to ensure
that ICE administrative law enforcement ac-
tivities do not affect the willingness of vic-
tims to report crimes, and to otherwise mini-
mize any other interference with the inves-
tigation or prosecution of crimes at the state
and local levels.
Within 90 days of the date of enactment of
this Act, and monthly thereafter, the Direc-
tor of ICE shall submit to the Committees a
Secure Communities report, as described in
House Report 115–239, and make the informa-
tion publicly available on its website.
The agreement provides not less than
$34,500,000, as requested, to support the au-
thorized level of 257 full-time law enforce-
ment specialists and officers at the Law En-
forcement Support Center (LESC). ICE is di-
rected to take steps to ensure that current
LESC operations remain centralized at the
current facility and are not unnecessarily
duplicated in other parts of the country. ICE
shall provide the Committees with a detailed
spending plan for the use of LESC funds, in-
cluding operations and staffing, not later
than 60 days after the date of enactment of
this Act. The Department is also directed to
notify the Committees prior to the realloca-
tion of any resources currently intended for
LESC operations in Vermont; it is expected
that no such reallocation will be made with-
out Committee concurrence.
ICE is directed to ensure that the LESC
has the resources and approvals necessary to
fully utilize its recruitment incentives pro-
gram and to include details about this pro-
gram in the annual spending plan required in
the above paragraph. The LESC is encour-
aged to utilize hiring campaigns and other
outreach activities, including coordination
with nearby community, technical, and state
colleges and universities, as well as its avail-
able direct hiring authorities, to accelerate
the hiring of qualified applicants.
Custody Operations. The total includes
$3,075,686,000 for Custody Operations.
Improvements to throughput in the immi-
gration enforcement and adjudication con-
tinuum could reduce the average length of
stay for detainees, ultimately requiring less
detention funding and lowering the require-
ment for available detention space. ICE shall
continue working with federal partners, in-
cluding the Executive Office for Immigration
Review (EOIR), to ensure that aliens are
treated fairly while moving through the im-
migration adjudication process and shall
provide quarterly briefings to the Commit-
tees. These briefings shall be provided by ICE
and those partners and shall address the im-
plementation of strategies to improve the ef-
ficiency and effectiveness of that process, in-
cluding efforts to reduce detainees’ average
length of stay. The first such briefing shall
be provided not later than 90 days after the
date of enactment of this Act.
ICE is directed to comply with the require-
ments of House Report 115–239 related to de-
tention facility inspections; death-in-cus-
tody reporting; access to facilities; detainee
locator information; changes to the current
detention facility category and inspection
framework; and compliance with the 2011
Performance Based National Detention
Standards (PBNDS 2011) and Prison Rape
Elimination Act requirements.
ICE shall provide a report not later than 90
days after the date of enactment of this Act
detailing the number and type of detention
contracts and Intergovernmental Service
Agreements currently in effect and all costs
associated with them. In addition, the Direc-
tor of ICE shall continue to report to the
Committees at least 30 days in advance of
entering into any new or significantly modi-
fied detention contract or other detention
agreement that does not meet or exceed
PBNDS 2011, as revised in 2016, and which
was in effect as of the date of enactment of
this Act. Each report shall include a jus-
tification for why such contract or agree-
ment requires different standards.
ICE is expected to comply with the direc-
tion provided in the Explanatory Statement
accompanying Public Law 115–31 related to
detention contracts and is directed to de-
velop a timeline detailing the steps the agen-
cy will take to recruit additional personnel
required for negotiating detention contracts.
ICE shall provide a briefing on this timeline
not later than 60 days after the date of en-
actment of this Act.
The Lyon v. ICE, et al. Settlement Agree-
ment required ICE to improve detainee tele-
phone access in four detention facilities in
Northern California. ICE is directed to en-
sure appropriate telephone access for detain-
ees at all of its facilities, including con-
tracted facilities, and to brief the Commit-
tees on the feasibility, benefits, and costs of
adhering to some or all of the telephone ac-
cess parameters of the settlement agreement
at all facilities within 90 days of the date of
enactment of this Act.
ICE shall adhere to the guidance specified
in House Report 115–239 regarding reporting
of family separation incidents; verifying the
location, status, and disposition of separated
family members; and complying with its Pa-
rental Interests Directive.
ICE shall notify the Committees prior to
releasing for budgetary reasons any indi-
vidual who is in removal proceedings or who
has a final order of removal. Any such notifi-
cation will include an explanation of how
ICE assessed the potential risk to the com-
munity by the release, the risk of absconding
associated with the release, and all efforts
taken by ICE or the Department to identify
other funding sources for transfer to this ac-
count to avoid such release.
The Fugitive Operations Program and the
Criminal Alien Program shall continue to
prioritize the apprehension and removal of
criminal aliens and individuals who pose a
risk to national security or public safety, as
described in Executive Order 13768.
Fugitive Operations. ICE is directed to
continue funding for at least ten Mobile
Criminal Alien Teams to supplement immi-
gration enforcement efforts that target at-

large aliens with serious criminal records, to
include sex offenders, drug traffickers, gang
members, and other violent felons. Further-
more, ICE shall continue to allocate not less
than $10,000,000 to investigative and support
activities required to identify and remove
aliens who have overstayed their visas and
shall brief the Committees semiannually on
the results of these efforts.
Criminal Alien Program. The bill funds the
287(g) program at the requested level of
$24,321,000. As ICE expands the number of ju-
risdictions participating in this program, it
must maintain rigorous processes to provide
oversight of 287(g)-designated officers, make
program transparency a high priority, and
proactively address stakeholder concerns.
The Office of State, Local, and Tribal Co-
operation shall continue outreach and com-
munications to public stakeholders, and ICE
shall continue to require the establishment
and regular use of steering committees for
each jurisdiction, as specified in House Re-
port 115–239. ICE shall notify the Committees
prior to implementing any significant
changes to the 287(g) program, including any
changes to authorized activities, training re-
quirements, data collection, or selection cri-
teria. Furthermore, ICE is directed to pro-
vide an annual report on the 287(g) program,
as specified in House Report 115–239. In addi-
tion, the OIG and the OCRCL shall continue
to provide careful oversight of the program.
Within the total, $2,000,000 is for con-
tinuing to provide information to jurisdic-
tions on ICE detainees with sex offender or
violent crime records who will reside in such
jurisdictions after being released from ICE
custody. ICE shall provide regular progress
reports on this effort.
Alternatives to Detention. The total in-
cludes $187,205,000 for the Alternatives to De-
tention (ATD) program to support a daily av-
erage of 79,000 participants, as requested. ICE
is directed to explore with its ATD con-
tractor the potential for applying some of
the promising elements of the Family Case
Management Program into the larger ATD
program, such as introducing a Know Your
Rights (KYR) program for new participants,
and to brief the Committees on this and
other feasible program improvements. With
regard to introducing a KYR element, the
briefing shall indicate at what stage of the
enrollment process it would be most effec-
tive.
ICE shall continuously explore the use of
innovative ATD models, and prioritize the
use of detention alternatives, including ATD
and release on parole or bond, for individuals
and families who receive positive credible
fear determinations and do not present a
public safety or flight risk.
Within the total, $3,000,000 is included for a
pilot program to enable certain aliens on the
non-detained docket to check in with ICE via
self-service kiosks at ERO field offices. The
pilot should reduce the time and resources
that deportation officers devote to managing
encounters and check-ins with applicable
aliens, and allowing those officer resources
to devote more time and effort to improving
attendance at immigration hearings and
compliance with removal orders.
ICE shall continue to provide performance
reports to the Committees on the ATD pro-
gram, as described in House Report 114–668.
MISSION SUPPORT
A total of $458,558,000 is provided for Mis-
sion Support, $108,167,000 above the request.
Included in the funding is $84,000,000 for re-
placement vehicles and $9,000,000 to address
the facility maintenance backlog. Addition-
ally, $6,000,000 is included to continue Immi-
gration Data Improvement activities in sup-
port of enhancing operational transparency
and strengthening resource allocation deci-
sions.
PROCUREMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND
IMPROVEMENTS
A total of $81,899,000 is provided for Pro-
curement, Construction, and Improvements
(PC&I). Included in the total is $29,000,000 to
address the facility backlog. Because funding
requested for financial systems moderniza-
tion and other programs could execute more
slowly than anticipated, ICE shall provide a
briefing on an updated PC&I spending plan
not later than 60 days after the date of en-
actment of this Act. ICE is also directed to
continue providing semiannual briefings on
TECS modernization efforts.

partially offset by $2,470,000,000 in estimated
aviation security fee collections that are
credited to this appropriation, as authorized,
resulting in a net appropriation of
$4,737,851,000. The bill provides funding avail-
ability through September 30, 2019, for O&S,
consistent with the period of availability in
prior years. However, the Transportation Se-
curity Administration (TSA) should plan for
a single year of availability for O&S funds in
fiscal year 2019.
TSA is directed to cease the practice of
submitting budget requests that assume rev-

AVIATION SCREENING OPERATIONS
A total of $4,949,502,000 is provided for
Aviation Screening Operations.
The total includes $77,000,000 above the re-
quest to maintain existing TSA staffing at
airport exit lanes, as required by law. The
total also includes $151,764,000, as requested,
for Canines. Combined with $8,200,000 in car-
ryover funding from fiscal year 2017, a total
of $159,964,000 is available for Canines in fis-
cal year 2018. TSA is expected to use carry-
over funds to continue its efforts to establish
a third party canine certification program
for air cargo services.
TSA is directed to brief the Committees
within 90 days of the date of enactment of
this Act on a multi-year plan to analyze and
test perimeter intrusion detection and deter-
rence technologies in partnership with air-
ports. The plan should include a sampling of
airports and technologies to maximize the
applicability of testing results for airports of
varying sizes and risk profiles, with a par-
ticular focus on high-risk airports that cur-
rently have limited capabilities. The testing
results should be made widely available to
assist airports in meeting their Airport Se-
curity Plan requirements. Up to $10,000,000 is
made available within the total for Screen-
ing Technology Maintenance to begin imple-
menting this plan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2553
March 22, 2018
With regard to remodeling and moderniza-
tion efforts undertaken by an airport on an
existing exit lane that TSA was responsible
for monitoring on December 1, 2013, TSA
shall continue to be responsible for moni-
toring the exit lane after the remodeling or
modernization effort is completed.
As TSA continues to evolve its screening
procedures from a one-size-fits all approach
to an intelligence-driven, risk-based ap-
proach, it is expected to continue working
with OIG to address vulnerabilities in risk-
based security initiatives, including the
PreCheck program.
TSA shall provide a notification within 10
days of any change to a private screening
contract, including any new award under the
Screening Partnership Program or a transi-
tion from privatized screening into federal
screening.
TSA is encouraged to continue exploring
collateral officer duties associated with be-
havioral detection and resolution proce-
dures.
TSA’s passenger screening canines play an
important role in the effective and efficient
screening of passengers through airport
checkpoints. There is concern with the cur-
rent availability of explosives detection ca-
nine teams at airport checkpoints and the
unmet demand for additional canine teams
throughout the U.S. transportation system.
While the TSA canine training center at
Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland is effec-
tive, it currently lacks the throughput need-
ed to meet the demand for trained and de-
ployed canines. TSA shall submit a report to
the Committees, not later than 90 days after
the date of enactment of this Act, on its ca-
nine requirements and a plan for expanding
the program. The plan should propose ways
to increase the throughput of canines, in-
cluding passenger and cargo screening ca-
nines, at the Lackland location. The plan
shall also detail funding and facilities re-
quirements, new policies, and other re-
sources necessary to execute this expansion.
To meet the increasing demand for explo-
sives detection canines, TSA is directed to
examine the feasibility of developing a dedi-
cated breeding program. This assessment
should consider cost, the length of time re-
quired to start a program, and a comparison
between the quality of dogs that might come
from such a breeding program and the cur-
rent practice of acquiring dogs from inter-
national and domestic vendors. TSA shall
also collaborate with other components to
determine if any benefits could be derived
from a department-wide breeding program.
TSA shall brief the Committees on its find-
ings not later than 180 days after the date of
enactment of this Act.
OTHER OPERATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT
A total of $1,389,091,000 is provided for
Other Operations and Enforcement.
Given current threats to the aviation sec-
tor, the total includes $45,000,000 above the
request to sustain the Law Enforcement Offi-
cer Reimbursement Program. The total in-
cludes $19,514,000 for the Federal Flight Deck
Officer and Crew Training Program. Com-
bined with $4,367,000 in carryover funding
from fiscal year 2017, a total of $23,881,000 is
available for this program in fiscal year 2018.
The total also includes $43,000,000 above the
request to maintain 31 Visible Intermodal
Prevention Response teams.
TSA is directed to continue efforts with its
airport partners to strengthen programs to
counter insider threats, such as more rig-
orous screening of employees prior to their
accessing secure areas. TSA shall provide a
briefing not later than 45 days after the date
of enactment of this Act on these efforts and
whether additional resources could enhance
them. The briefing should specifically assess
the feasibility of integrating additional
qualified screening technology into the em-
ployee screening process.
The funding level for the Federal Air Mar-
shals Service (FAMS) reflects TSA’s inabil-
ity to hire and backfill positions at the rate
projected in the request. TSA shall continue
to submit quarterly reports on FAMS mis-
sion coverage, staffing levels, and hiring
rates as directed in prior years. FAMS is di-
rected to brief the Committees not later
than 90 days after the date of enactment of
this Act on efforts to better incorporate risk
into its deployment decisions, in accordance
with the recommendations outlined in GAO-
16-582.
TSA shall provide quarterly briefings on
its air cargo security investments, to include
the metrics derived from recent tests and the
mitigation strategies employed in response

60 days after the date of enactment of this
Act and to request funding for the programs
in future budget requests. The Coast Guard
should continue to collaborate with the Na-
tional Institute of Occupational Safety and
Health on fishing safety research, and shall
submit the report required by Senate Report
114–264 without delay. That report shall in-
clude a notice of funding availability, a
schedule for grant awards, and metrics to
measure impact and effectiveness.
Based on recent reporting pursuant to Pub-
lic Law 94–254, the Coast Guard is experi-
encing an increase in costs that will result in
diminished resources for other statutory
missions. The Coast Guard shall appro-
priately account for these needs in future

March 22, 2018
VESSELS
To the maximum extent practicable, the
Coast Guard is directed to utilize compo-
nents that are manufactured in the United
States when contracting for new vessels.
Such components include: auxiliary equip-
ment, such as pumps for shipboard services;
propulsion equipment including engines, re-
duction gears, and propellers; shipboard
cranes; and spreaders for shipboard cranes.
The Coast Guard shall be exempted from
the administration’s current acquisition pol-
icy that requires the Coast Guard to attain
the total acquisition cost for a vessel, in-
cluding long lead time materials (LLTM),
production costs, and postproduction costs,
before a production contract can be awarded.
Survey and Design—Vessels and Boats. The
total includes $4,500,000 to support survey
and design. To enhance icebreaking capacity
on the Great Lakes, $3,000,000 is included for
survey and design work to support the acqui-
sition of an icebreaker that is at least as ca-
pable as the USCGC MACKINAW (WLBB–30).
National Security Cutter. The total in-
cludes $1,241,000,000 for the NSC program.
This amount includes $540,000,000 for the con-
struction of a tenth NSC, $95,000,000 to be
made immediately available to contract for
LLTM for an eleventh NSC, and $540,000,000
for the construction of the eleventh NSC.
Crewing concepts initiated by the Coast
Guard that underpinned the assumption that
12 High Endurance Cutters could be replaced
with 8 NSCs have proven unworkable.
Offshore Patrol Cutter. The recommenda-
tion includes $500,000,000 for the OPC, con-
sistent with the budget request. These funds
will provide for production of OPC1, LLTM
for OPC2, program activities, test and eval-
uation, government furnished equipment,
and training aids.
Fast Response Cutter. The Coast Guard
program of record calls for 58 FRCs, of which
44 have been ordered and 26 have been deliv-
ered and are in service today. The rec-
ommendation provides $340,000,000 for six
FRCs, four of which are for the current pro-
gram of record and two of which are to ini-
tiate replacement of the 110-foot Island Class
Cutters supporting U.S. Central Command in
Southwest Asia.
Polar Ice Breaking Vessel. The rec-
ommendation includes $19,000,000, consistent
with the budget request, to maintain the ac-
celerated acquisition schedule established in
fiscal year 2017 for a new class of Polar Ice-
breakers. These funds will be used to request
proposals and award contracts for detailed
design and options for future vessel con-
struction.
The Coast Guard is directed to initiate a
service life extension project to rehabilitate
and restore the critical systems onboard the
heavy icebreaker POLAR STAR. Increased
efforts shall be made during maintenance
availability periods to rehabilitate major
systems and accelerate contracting for this
work to the greatest extent possible. In car-
rying out such efforts, the Coast Guard is en-
couraged to address the rehabilitation and
replacement of old and obsolete systems that
are in poor material condition and may im-
pair crew readiness or safety.
Inland Waterways and Western Rivers Cut-
ters. The Coast Guard’s fleet of inland river
tenders range in size from 65 to 160 feet and
were commissioned between 1944 and 1990.
This fleet, which has an average age of 52
years, helps ensure the integrity of the
structures, beacons, and buoys that support
the vital U.S. Marine Transportation Sys-
tem. In addition to age concerns and equip-
ment obsolescence issues, the fleet presents
other challenges, including the presence of
asbestos and lead paint, which raise concerns
about crew health. The recommendation pro-
vides $25,000,000 above the request to accel-
erate the acquisition of a new Waterways
Commerce Cutter.
AIRCRAFT
HC–130J Conversion/Sustainment. The
total includes $100,600,000 for the HC–130J air-
craft program. This amount is $95,000,000
above the request for the procurement of one
HC–130J aircraft.
MH–60T Conversion/Sustainment. The bill
supports efforts to recapitalize MH–60T air-
craft. The Coast Guard is directed to brief
the Committees, not later than 90 days after
the date of enactment of this Act, on options
for extending the lifespan of its MH–60T air-
craft, including associated costs and
timelines for each option.
HC–27J Conversion/Sustainment. The total
includes $18,000,000 above the request for the
procurement of an HC–27J training simulator
to be located at the Coast Guard Aviation
Training Center.
SHORE FACILITIES
The total includes $134,500,000 for Shore
Facilities and Aids to Navigation. The Com-
mandant is directed to provide to the Com-
mittees, at the time of each budget submis-
sion, a list of approved but unfunded Coast
Guard priorities and the funds needed for
each.
Not later than 180 days after the date of
enactment of this Act, the Coast Guard shall
submit to the Committees a report on a plan
to provide communications throughout the
entire Coastal Western Alaska Captain of the
Port zone to improve waterway safety and to
mitigate close calls, collisions, and other
dangerous interactions between large ships
and subsistence hunter vessels. The report
should also include: any shore infrastructure
improvements necessary to fulfill such a
plan; an explanation of the feasibility of es-
tablishing a vessel traffic service that covers
the region using existing resources or public-
private partnerships; and a timeline of when
funding is needed to implement these im-
provements.
The Coast Guard has considered estab-
lishing anchorages in the Hudson River and
has completed an Advanced Notice of Pro-
posed Rulemaking. After receiving com-
ments, the Coast Guard is conducting a full
Ports and Waterways Safety Assessment to
best determine whether and how to proceed.
Prior to any proposal to establish these an-
chorages, the Coast Guard shall brief the
Committees on the results of the assessment
and its plans regarding the anchorages.
Major Construction; Housing; ATON; and
Survey & Design. The total includes
$32,400,000 above the request to address the
top housing priority on the Coast Guard’s
Unfunded Priority List.
Major Acquisition System Infrastructure.
The total includes $8,000,000 for infrastruc-
ture associated with the procurement of an
HC–27J training simulator and $19,100,000 to
address the top Major Acquisition System
Infrastructure priorities on the Coast
Guard’s Unfunded Priority List.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST, AND
EVALUATION
A total of $29,141,000 is provided for Re-
search, Development, Test, and Evaluation.
Disruptions to Global Positioning System
(GPS) signals can cause severe problems for
ship navigation, port security, and situa-
tional awareness. In recent years, incidents
of GPS tampering have disrupted the flow of
commerce within ports by blocking the sig-
nals needed for crane operators to locate and
move goods. When these signals are blocked,
the delays associated with the manual loca-
tion of containers can all but shut down port
operations. Therefore, $500,000 is provided for
the Coast Guard to conduct digital forensics
research and testing on devices meant to jam
or otherwise interfere with GPS signals.
The Coast Guard continues to face chal-
lenges with respect to conducting maritime
surveillance necessary to support its statu-
tory missions related to marine safety, secu-
rity, and protection in the Pacific Ocean. To
address this concern, up to $5,000,000 is made
available within the total amount to conduct
a full maritime domain awareness pilot
study and assessment to determine the effi-
cacy of using low-cost, commercially avail-
able technology solutions, in combination
with or on existing fleet platforms, to en-
hance maritime domain awareness. This ef-
fort should test technology solutions across
the fleet, including with the Coast Guard
Auxiliary if applicable. The Coast Guard is
encouraged to consider systems that have
been used by small, remote Pacific Island
states and other technologies with little or
no logistics funding tail. The Coast Guard
shall brief the Committees not later than 60
days after the date of enactment of this Act
on its approach to carrying out this study.
The briefing shall include a timeline for the
development of a concept of operations and
business case analysis, as well as a plan for
industry engagement and technology dem-
onstration.
As the Coast Guard’s only functional heavy
icebreaker, the POLAR STAR, reaches the
end of its service life, a potential gap may
emerge with respect to the Coast Guard’s
polar icebreaker capability before new heavy
icebreaking vessels can be acquired. To help
address that potential gap, up to $5,000,000 is
made available within the total to examine
whether the Coast Guard’s statutory require-
ments could be met by existing vessels using
short-term procurement strategies.
In fiscal year 2017, Congress provided
$18,000,000 for the Coast Guard to test and
evaluate the use of long range/ultra-long en-
durance UAS in support of the Department’s
needs, particularly intelligence, surveil-
lance, and reconnaissance in source and
transit zones. The Coast Guard is directed to
fulfill the related briefing requirement in the
explanatory statement accompanying Public
Law 115–31 and directs the Coast Guard to al-
locate such fiscal year 2018 sums as may be
necessary to continue this long range/ultra-
long endurance UAS effort.

partments and agencies as they participate
in the NCPS and to provide semiannual
briefings to the Committees, beginning not
later than 30 days after the date of enact-
ment of this Act, on any obstacles that arise
with regard to such participation.
GAO–16–294 found that NPPD is not fully
utilizing the capability of NCPS to detect
potentially malicious activity entering or
exiting computer systems on the ‘‘.gov’’ net-
work. The total includes $3,000,000 for pilot
programs to help address the GAO report’s
related recommendation and to comply with
the mandate in the Cybersecurity Act of 2015

to conduct regular assessments of advanced
protective technologies through pilots. The
pilots should be conducted in collaboration
with the National Institute of Standards and
Technology and other appropriate entities.
Not later than 120 days after the date of
enactment of this Act, NPPD and FEMA
shall brief the Committees on the types of
grant assistance, technical assistance, and
formal ongoing engagement available to
SLTT government entities, including law en-
forcement agencies, for the purpose of pro-
tecting their cyber networks. Within 240
days of the date of enactment of this Act,
NPPD shall provide an assessment to the
Committees of the overall effectiveness of
this assistance and outreach in improving
cybersecurity capacity and performance at
non-federal levels of government. The De-
partment may provide technical assistance
and support to SLTT entities related to the
purchase of commercial software capable of
protecting the integrity of government infor-
mation and networks against intrusions.
The fiscal year 2017 National Defense Au-
thorization Act (Public Law 114–328) required
DHS to provide Congress with a depart-
mental cybersecurity strategy. In light of re-
cent cyber events, DHS is expected to accel-
erate the completion of this strategy and to
continue to engage with relevant public and
private stakeholders to help prevent and
mitigate future cyber intrusions.
INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION
A total of $194,216,000 is provided for Infra-
structure Protection.
Infrastructure Capacity Building. The
total includes $16,199,000 for the Office of
Bombing Prevention (OBP). This funding
will sustain needed training, information
sharing, and awareness programs for SLTT
and private sector entities related to trends
in terrorist utilization of explosives. The
funding will also provide for analysis of cur-
rent counter-explosives capabilities and
identification of capability gaps. NPPD
should explore how coordination with the
National Guard on training could be further
enhanced.
The total includes $2,000,000 for the Tech-
nology Development and Deployment Pro-
gram to identify requirements for NPPD; for
community-level critical infrastructure pro-
tection and resilience; and to rapidly de-
velop, test, and transition technologies that
address such requirements.

gency Communications, of which $1,785,000 is
for the EISI and $2,000,000 is to continue Na-
tional Emergency Communications Plan de-
velopment projects.
NPPD is directed to include in the next Bi-
ennial Report to Congress on Emergency
Communications the status of interoper-
ability planning for public safety commu-
nications systems. Because achieving inter-
operability among these systems is chal-
lenged by separate planning efforts for dif-
ferent kinds of systems (such as alert and
warning, next generation 911, and
broadband), the report should specifically
identify what gaps exist among such sys-
tems. Furthermore, NPPD is directed to
share information with FEMA on critical
interoperable communications gaps in order
to better inform grant award decision mak-
ing.
INTEGRATED OPERATIONS
The total includes $142,663,000 for Inte-
grated Operations.
Cyber and Infrastructure Analysis. The
total includes $18,650,000 for the National In-
frastructure Simulation and Analysis Cen-
ter; $1,350,000 for the EISI; and, $2,000,000 for
evaluating utility grid resiliency using real
and simulated experimentation to test tech-
nologies, train operators, and quantify im-
pacts and risks. The results of these evalua-
tions should also inform how NPPD employs
response tactics and prioritizes future in-
vestments.
Stakeholder Engagement and Require-
ments. The total includes $1,679,000 for soft-
ware assurance and $2,000,000 to enhance sup-
ply chain security.
OFFICE OF BIOMETRIC IDENTITY MANAGEMENT
OBIM is directed to continue briefing the
Committees on a semiannual basis on its
workload, staffing levels, modernization ef-
forts, and improvements in the sharing of ap-
propriate identity information between DHS
and other departments and agencies, includ-
ing through the implementation of Unique
Identity and the information systems dis-
cussed below. The information sharing briefs
should specifically address capability gaps
and strategies to close them.
As development of the Homeland Advanced
Recognition Technology (HART) system con-
tinues, OBIM is expected to closely coordi-
nate with TSA, CBP, the Department of De-
fense (DOD), the Department of Justice, the
Department of State, the intelligence com-
munity, and other relevant agencies to
standardize and appropriately share biomet-
ric information. In particular, OBIM shall
continue to work with DOD to implement in-
terim solutions to expand interagency bio-
metric data-sharing and ingest legally
shareable data from DOD’s Automated Bio-
metric Identification System (ABIS) into
IDENT/HART for appropriate use by compo-
nents. Additionally, as directed in prior
Committee reports, OBIM shall continue to
coordinate with TSA to ensure that TSA’s
Technology Infrastructure Modernization
systems are appropriately integrated with
HART.
OBIM shall incorporate the latest proven
biometric technologies, including advanced
facial recognition, in its ongoing enhance-
ments to the IDENT/HART system and en-
sure the needs of stakeholders are addressed.

On October 6, 2017, the Department notified
the Committees that it intended to use its
authority under section 872 of the Homeland
Security Act to consolidate the Domestic
Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), the Office
of Health Affairs (OHA), and a number of ac-
tivities and personnel from other compo-
nents into a new Countering Weapons of
Mass Destruction (CWMD) Office, effective
December 5, 2017. Because of the challenges
associated with transitioning to new Treas-
ury accounts in the middle of a fiscal year,
however, DHS did not propose the transfer of
OHA and DNDO funding into new CWMD Of-
fice accounts. As a consequence, OHA and
DNDO will continue to operate and be funded
as separate components during fiscal year
2018.
An administrative provision is included in
title V of this Act to permit DHS to begin
executing funds through new CWMD appro-
priations accounts beginning on October 1,
2018, but only subsequent to the enactment
of legislation explicitly authorizing the es-
tablishment of such an Office.
In January 2018, the Assistant Secretary
for CWMD briefed the Committees on a pro-
curement action made to resource a pilot
program in support of state and local law en-
forcement and first responders. However,
neither OHA nor DNDO requested funding in
any budget for this activity, nor had the of-
fices developed any goals, objectives, or cri-
teria for success prior to embarking on this
new pilot. In the future, the Department is
expected to follow the acquisition manage-
ment process, as defined in DHS Manage-
ment Directive 102–01, and to include such
programs in its budget justification mate-
rials to Congress. While emerging require-
ments may necessitate agencies to shift
funds in the year of execution, all compo-
nents of DHS must adhere to section 503 re-
programming and transfer conditions. If a
new requirement is addressed through a re-
programming that falls below the section 503
notification threshold, all components must
still adhere to program management prin-
cipals and an acquisition management proc-
ess that yields transparency and efficiency.
Language is included in this explanatory
statement under FEMA—Federal Assistance
directing the submission of a report on the
types of assistance across DHS components
available to SLTT governments.
CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL READINESS
The total includes $79,130,000 for the Chem-

hancements; $800,000 to continue the develop-
ment of a comprehensive exercise, workshop,
and technical assistance program for food,
agriculture, and veterinary preparedness;
and $500,000 to continue implementing the
voluntary anthrax vaccine program for
emergency responders.
INTEGRATED OPERATIONS
The total includes $9,400,000 for Integrated
Operations. This amount includes an in-
crease above the request of $8,000,000 to con-
tinue support for the National Biosurveil-
lance Integration Center, as authorized by
Public Law 110–53. Not later than 90 days
after the date of enactment of this Act, the
Department shall submit a five-year stra-
tegic plan that outlines NBIC’s proposed ca-
pabilities, objectives, a roadmap to achiev-
ing those objectives, and performance
metrics by which to measure success. NBIC
is encouraged to continue its engagement in
support of a visualization tool that incor-
porates data from state and local entities
that can serve as a bio-preparedness tool for
emergency response, emergency manage-
ment, and law enforcement at all levels of
government.

ing will be limited to urban areas rep-
resenting up to 85 percent of the cumulative
national terrorism risk to urban areas and
that resources will continue to be allocated
in proportion to risk.
National Predisaster Mitigation Fund. The
total includes $249,200,000 for Predisaster
Mitigation. Predisaster Mitigation prevents
loss of life and leads to significant savings by

with institutions offering graduate level pro-
grams to address cybersecurity needs of
rural communities and their intersection.
DISASTER RELIEF FUND
A total of $7,900,720,000 is provided for the
Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), of which
$7,366,000,000 is designated as being for dis-
aster relief for major disasters pursuant to
section 251(b)(2)(D) of the Balanced Budget
and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.
FEMA shall brief the Committees on rec-
ommendations for modifying the disaster
declaration process to better focus federal
assistance on events during which SLTT ca-
pabilities are truly overwhelmed or lives and
property are at risk. The briefing shall in-
clude an assessment of the suitability of the
per capita indicator, consideration of severe
local impacts of disasters, FEMA’s ongoing
analysis of the disaster deductible model,
and any other policy changes FEMA is con-
sidering.
Disaster mitigation structures such as sea-
walls are deemed public infrastructure if
they are owned by a SLTT government, un-
less clear ownership by a SLTT government
cannot be established. FEMA is encouraged
to consider making Public Assistance and In-
dividual Assistance grant funding available
for repairs to disaster mitigation structures
to the fullest extent allowed by the Stafford
Act.
NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE FUND
A total of $203,500,000 is provided for the
National Flood Insurance Fund.
Not later than 90 days after the date of en-
actment of this Act, FEMA shall brief the
Committees on efforts underway to imple-
ment the Consumer Option for an Alter-
native System to Allocate Losses Act (Pub-
lic Law 112–141), related to flood insurance
reform and modernization, and shall detail
all ongoing collaboration with the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
FEMA is encouraged to consider how to
better leverage partnerships with public-pri-
vate, higher education, not-for-profit, and
other institutions with expertise in the Com-
munity Rating System program through
competitive grant programs or other incen-
tives.
FEMA is encouraged to maximize public
awareness and interaction when mapping or
remapping an area to ensure maps most ac-
curately reflect real-time, local conditions.
FEMA is urged to implement the rec-
ommendations of the Technical Mapping As-
sistance Council’s 2015 and 2016 Annual Re-
ports, which recommended transitioning to
structure-specific flood risk analysis, incor-
porating high-resolution topographic data
into flood risk maps, and better commu-
nicating current and future flood risk to
property owners. FEMA should coordinate
with state agencies and other experts that
have developed mapping expertise and mod-
els that can be useful in FEMA’s efforts to
understand future conditions.

LABORATORY FACILITIES
The total includes $150,116,000 for Labora-
tory Facilities. The total fully restores fund-
ing for laboratories proposed for closure, in-
cluding continued operational costs of
$44,315,000 for the National Biodefense Anal-
ysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC);
$1,900,000 for the Chemical Security Analysis
Center (CSAC); and $3,400,000 for the Na-
tional Urban Security Technology Labora-
tory (NUSTL). The total also fully funds Na-
tional Bio and Agro-defense Facility (NBAF)
operations, in accordance with the Depart-
ment’s life cycle cost estimate.
DHS retains responsibility for completing
construction of NBAF. DHS is directed to
maintain the ability to readily execute the
Management, Operations, and Research Sup-
port contract through the end of fiscal year
2018 if DHS or USDA determine that its utili-
zation would expedite or enhance NBAF’s
ability to be fully operational by December
31, 2022.
The fiscal year 2019 budget request pro-
poses the continued funding of NBACC oper-
ations and includes a change in the business
funding model to maintain and operate the
laboratory, under which S&T and the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation would share
budgetary responsibility of NBACC’s Na-
tional Bioforensic Analysis Center (NBFAC).
This cost-sharing arrangement would result
in a more efficient operational model and en-
sure this national capability remains avail-
able to help defend the United States against
bioterrorism threats. Further details on the
long-term strategy for NBACC, including
NBFAC, should be included in the report re-
quired by Public Law 115–91.
ACQUISITION AND OPERATIONS ANALYSIS
The total includes $46,245,000 for Acquisi-
tion and Operations Analysis. This amount
includes $3,000,000 for the Office of Stand-
ards; $3,773,000 for Joint Requirements Coun-
cil (JRC) Support; $2,396,000 for Operational
Test and Evaluation; and $5,364,000 for Sys-
tems Engineering and Research.
S&T is encouraged to continue to make its
department-wide perspective and technical
expertise available to the JRC and USM to
support efforts to determine component ca-
pability gaps, the maturity of technologies
that could fill such gaps, and the feasibility
of cross-component solutions.
S&T is encouraged to explore a systems en-
gineering research partnership with the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers that could stream-
line acquisition through modeling and sim-
ulation.
MISSION SUPPORT
The total includes $134,752,000 for Mission
Support. This amount includes realignments
from other S&T PPAs for the Compliance
Assurance Program Office, which provides

activities are compliant with relevant inter-
national agreements, federal regulations,
DHS policies, and related standards and
guidance.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
A total of $509,830,000 is provided for Re-
search and Development (R&D). S&T is di-
rected to continue to prioritize applied re-
search activities that provide innovative so-
lutions to DHS, its components, and their
primary stakeholders. To promote unity of
effort and cross-component commonality,
S&T should remain the central component

research and development benefit the econ-
omy and the manufacturing base. Expanding
the availability of highly-qualified manufac-
turers can save money for the taxpayer and
the Department and more quickly deliver so-
lutions and equipment to end users.
Funding is provided for S&T to engage a
Partnership Intermediary or Intermediaries,
as defined in 15 U.S.C. 3715, to support the
Department’s ability to seek out, assess, and
engage non-traditional small business ven-
dors as part of the Department’s develop-
ment and acquisition efforts. Intermediaries
should have a successful history of
leveraging external networks and using inno-
vative means to identify and recruit small
businesses and manufacturers to partner
with the Department on innovative solutions
and technologies. This effort should include,
but should not be limited to, providing tech-
nology assessments and design reviews for
the Department’s development efforts. The
Office of the Chief Procurement Officer is di-
rected to issue policy guidance allowing con-
tracting officers to obligate funding for such
partnerships.
UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS
A total of $40,500,000 is provided for Univer-
sity Programs. Due to funding constraints,
the fiscal year 2018 budget proposed to elimi-
nate one Center of Excellence (COE) and to
not re-compete two other COEs. The total
provided for University Programs enables
S&T to fund 10 COEs and continue its cur-
rent COE program. S&T shall notify the
Committees prior to eliminating any COEs.
S&T is encouraged to prioritize collabora-
tions with qualified research universities to
support critical research topics in priority
areas, including maritime security, cross-
border threat screening, unmanned systems,
counterterrorism, emerging analytics, cyber-
security, first responder safety, and critical
infrastructure.
DOMESTIC NUCLEAR DETECTION OFFICE
OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT
A total of $54,664,000 is provided for Oper-
ations and Support.
On October 6, 2017, the Department notified
the Committees that it intended to use its
authority under section 872 of the Homeland
Security Act to consolidate DNDO, OHA, and
a number of activities and personnel from
other components into a new CWMD Office,
effective December 5, 2017. Because of the
challenges associated with transitioning to
new Treasury accounts in the middle of a fis-
cal year, however, DHS did not propose the
transfer of OHA and DNDO funding into new
CWMD Office accounts. As a consequence,
OHA and DNDO will continue to operate and
be funded as separate components during fis-
cal year 2018.
An administrative provision is included in
title V of this Act to permit DHS to begin
executing funds through new CWMD appro-
priations accounts beginning on October 1,
2018, but only subsequent to the enactment
of legislation explicitly authorizing the es-
tablishment of such an Office.
Language is included in this explanatory
statement under OHA—Operations and Sup-
port directing OHA and DNDO to adhere to
the DHS acquisition management process.
Language is included in this explanatory
statement under FEMA—Federal Assistance
directing the submission of a report on the
types of assistance across DHS components
available to SLTT governments.

TITLE V—GENERAL PROVISIONS
(INCLUDING RESCISSIONS AND TRANSFER OF
FUNDS)
Section 501. The bill continues a provision
directing that no part of any appropriation
shall remain available for obligation beyond
the current year unless expressly provided.
Section 502. The bill continues a provision
providing authority to merge unexpended
balances of prior appropriations with new ap-
propriation accounts, to be used for the same
purpose, subject to reprogramming guide-
lines.
Section 503. The bill continues a provision
limiting reprogramming authority for funds
within an appropriation and providing lim-
ited authority for transfers between appro-
priations. All components funded by the De-
partment of Homeland Security Appropria-
tions Act, 2018, must comply with these
transfer and reprogramming requirements.
The Department must notify the Commit-
tees on Appropriations prior to each re-
programming of funds that would reduce pro-
grams, projects, activities, or personnel by
ten percent or more. Notifications are also
required for each reprogramming of funds
that would increase a program, project, or
activity by more than $5,000,000 or ten per-
cent, whichever is less. The Department
must submit these notifications to the Com-
mittees on Appropriations at least 15 days in
advance of any such reprogramming.
For purposes of reprogramming notifica-
tions, ‘‘program, project, or activity’’ is de-
fined as an amount identified in the detailed
funding table located at the end of this
statement or an amount directed for a spe-
cific purpose in this statement. Also for pur-
poses of reprogramming notifications, the
creation of a new program, project, or activ-
ity is defined as any significant new activity
that has not been explicitly justified to the

Congress in budget justification material
and for which funds have not been appro-
priated by the Congress. For further guid-
ance when determining which movements of
funds are subject to section 503, the Depart-
ment is reminded to follow GAO’s definition
of ‘‘program, project, or activity’’ as detailed
in the GAO’s A Glossary of Terms Used in
the Federal Budget Process. Within 30 days
of the date of enactment of this Act, the De-
partment shall submit to the Committees a
table delineating PPAs subject to section 503
notification requirements, as defined in this
paragraph.
Limited transfer authority is provided to
give the Department flexibility in respond-
ing to emerging requirements and signifi-
cant changes in circumstances, but is not
primarily intended to facilitate the imple-
mentation of new programs, projects, or ac-
tivities that were not proposed in a formal
budget submission. Transfers may not reduce
accounts by more than five percent or in-
crease accounts by more than ten percent.
The Committees on Appropriations must be
notified 30 days in advance of any transfer.
To avoid violations of the Anti-Deficiency
Act, the Secretary shall ensure that any
transfer of funds is carried out in compliance
with the limitations and requirements of
section 503(b). In particular, the Secretary
should ensure that any such transfers adhere
to the opinion of the Comptroller General’s
decision in the Matter of: John D. Webster,
Director, Financial Services, Library of Con-
gress, dated November 7, 1997, with regard to
the definition of an appropriation subject to
transfer limitations.
The Department shall submit notifications
on a timely basis and provide complete ex-
planations of the proposed reallocations, in-
cluding detailed justifications for the in-
creases and offsets, and any specific impact
the proposed changes would have on the
budget request for the following fiscal year
and future-year appropriations require-
ments. Each notification submitted to the
Committees should include a detailed table
showing the proposed revisions to funding
and FTE—at the account, program, project,
and activity level—for the current fiscal
year, along with any funding and FTE im-
pacts on the budget year.
The Department shall manage its pro-
grams, projects, and activities within the
levels appropriated, and should only submit
reprogramming or transfer notifications in
cases of unforeseeable and compelling cir-
cumstances that could not have been pre-
dicted when formulating the budget request
for the current fiscal year. When the Depart-
ment submits a reprogramming or transfer
notification and does not receive identical
responses from the House and Senate Com-
mittees, it is expected to reconcile the dif-
ferences before proceeding.
The Department is not to submit a re-
programming or transfer notification after
June 30 except in extraordinary cir-
cumstances that imminently threaten the
safety of human life or the protection of
property. If an above-threshold reprogram-
ming or a transfer is needed after June 30,
the notification should contain sufficient
documentation as to why it meets this statu-
tory exception.
Deobligated funds are also subject to the
reprogramming and transfer limitations and
requirements set forth in section 503.
Section 503(f) authorizes the Secretary to
transfer up to $20,000,000 to address immigra-
tion emergencies after notifying the Com-
mittees of such transfer at least five days in
advance.
Section 504. The bill continues a provision
by reference, prohibiting funds appropriated
or otherwise made available to the Depart-
ment to make payment to the Working Cap-
ital Fund (WCF), except for activities and
amounts allowed in the President’s fiscal
year 2018 budget request. Funds provided to
the WCF are available until expended. The
Department can only charge components for
direct usage of the WCF and these funds may
be used only for the purposes consistent with
the contributing component. Any funds paid
in advance or for reimbursement must re-
flect the full cost of each service. The De-
partment shall submit a notification prior to
adding a new activity to the fund or elimi-
nating an existing activity from the fund.
For activities added to the fund, such notifi-
cations shall detail the source of funds by
PPA. In addition, the Department shall sub-
mit quarterly WCF execution reports to the
Committees that include activity level de-
tail.
Section 505. The bill continues a provision
providing that not to exceed 50 percent of
unobligated balances from prior-year appro-
priations for each Operations and Support
appropriation, the Coast Guard’s Operating
Expenses appropriation, and amounts for sal-
aries and expenses in the Coast Guard’s Re-
serve Training and Acquisition, Construc-
tion, and Improvements accounts, shall re-
main available through fiscal year 2018, sub-
ject to section 503 reprogramming require-
ments.
Section 506. The bill continues a provision
that deems intelligence activities to be spe-
cifically authorized during fiscal year 2018
until the enactment of an Act authorizing
intelligence activities for fiscal year 2018.
Section 507. The bill continues a provision
requiring notification to the Committees at
least three days before DHS executes or an-
nounces grant allocations; grant awards;
contract awards, including contracts covered
by the Federal Acquisition Regulation; other
transaction agreements; letters of intent;
task or delivery orders on multiple contract
awards totaling $1,000,000 or more; a task or
delivery orders greater than $10,000,000 from
multi-year funds; or sole-source grant
awards. Notifications shall include a descrip-
tion of the project or projects or activities to
be funded and the location, including city,
county, and state. If the Secretary deter-
mines that compliance would pose substan-
tial risk to health, human life, or safety, an
award may be made without prior notifica-
tion but the Committees shall be notified
within 5 full business days after such award
or letter is issued.
Section 508. The bill continues a provision
prohibiting all agencies from purchasing,
constructing, or leasing additional facilities
for federal law enforcement training without
advance notification to the Committees.
Section 509. The bill continues a provision
prohibiting the use of funds for any con-
struction, repair, alteration, or acquisition
project for which a prospectus, if required
under chapter 33 of title 40, United States
Code, has not been approved.
Section 510. The bill continues a provision
that includes and consolidates by reference
prior-year statutory provisions related to a
contracting officer’s technical representa-
tive training; sensitive security information;
and the use of funds in conformance with
section 303 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992.
Section 511. The bill continues a provision
prohibiting the use of funds in contravention
of the Buy American Act.
Section 512. The bill continues a provision
regarding the oath of allegiance required by
section 337 of the Immigration and Nation-
ality Act.
Section 513. The bill continues a provision
prohibiting funds for the Principal Federal
Official during a Stafford Act declared dis-
aster or emergency, with certain exceptions.
Section 514. The bill continues a provision
that precludes DHS from using funds in this
Act to carry out reorganization authority.
This prohibition is not intended to prevent
the Department from carrying out routine or
small reallocations of personnel or functions
within components, subject to section 503 of
this Act. This section prevents large-scale
reorganization of the Department, which
should be acted on legislatively by the rel-
evant congressional committees of jurisdic-
tion. Any DHS proposal to reorganize compo-
nents that is included as part of a budget re-
quest will be considered by the Committees.
Section 515. The bill continues a provision
prohibiting funds for planning, testing, pilot-
ing, or developing a national identification
card.
Section 516. The bill continues a provision
directing that any official required by this
Act to report or certify to the Committees
on Appropriations may not delegate such au-
thority unless expressly authorized to do so
in this Act.
Section 517. The bill continues a provision
prohibiting the use of funds for the transfer
or release of individuals detained at United
States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba into or within the United States.
Section 518. The bill continues a provision
prohibiting funds in this Act to be used for
first-class travel.
Section 519. The bill continues a provision
prohibiting the use of funds to employ illegal
workers as described in Section 274A(h)(3) of
the Immigration and Nationality Act.
Section 520. The bill continues a provision
prohibiting funds appropriated or otherwise
made available by this Act to pay for award
or incentive fees for contractors with below
satisfactory performance or performance
that fails to meet the basic requirements of
the contract.
Section 521. The bill continues and modi-
fies a provision to make permanent a re-
quirement that the Secretary ensure screen-
ing of passengers and crews for transpor-
tation and national security purposes are
consistent with applicable laws, regulations,
and guidance on privacy and civil liberties.
Section 522. The bill continues a provision
prohibiting the use of funds to enter into a
federal contract unless the contract meets
requirements of the Federal Property and
Administrative Services Act of 1949 or chap-
ter 137 of title 10 U.S.C., and the Federal Ac-
quisition Regulation, unless the contract is
otherwise authorized by statute without re-
gard to this section.
Section 523. The bill continues and modi-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2609
March 22, 2018
DIVISION G—DEPARTMENT OF THE INTE-
RIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED
AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018
The following statement is an explanation
of the effects of Division G, which makes ap-
propriations for the Department of the Inte-
rior, the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), the Forest Service, the Indian Health
Service, and related agencies for fiscal year
2018.
The joint explanatory statement accom-
panying this division is approved and indi-
cates congressional intent. Unless otherwise
noted, the language set forth in House Re-
port 115–238 carries the same weight as lan-
guage included in this joint explanatory
statement and should be complied with un-
less specifically addressed to the contrary in
this joint explanatory statement. While
some language is repeated for emphasis, it is
not intended to negate the language referred
to above unless expressly provided herein.
In instances where the House report speaks
more broadly to policy issues or offers views
that are subject to interpretation, such
views remain those of the House and are not
affirmed by this explanatory statement un-
less repeated herein. In cases where the
House report or this explanatory statement
directs the submission of a report, such re-
port is to be submitted to both the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations.
Where this explanatory statement refers to
the Committees or the Committees on Ap-
propriations, unless otherwise noted, this
reference is to the House Subcommittee on
Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies
and the Senate Subcommittee on Interior,
Environment, and Related Agencies.
The Committees direct each department
and agency funded in this Act to follow the
directions set forth in this Act and the ac-
companying statement, and not reallocate
resources or reorganize activities except as
provided herein or otherwise approved by the
Committees through the reprogramming
process as referenced in this explanatory
statement. This explanatory statement ad-
dresses only those agencies and accounts for
which there is a need for greater explanation
than provided in the Act itself. Funding lev-
els for appropriations by account, program,
and activity, with comparisons to the fiscal
year 2017 enacted level and the fiscal year
2018 budget request, can be found in the table
at the end of this division.
Unless expressly stated otherwise, any ref-
erence to ‘‘this Act’’ or ‘‘at the end of this
statement’’ shall be treated as referring only
to the provisions of this division.
Committee Directives.—The Department
of the Interior and Forest Service are di-
rected to continue the directions included in
the Explanatory Statement accompanying
the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017
(P.L. 115–31) relating to Vacant Grazing Al-
lotments; State Wildlife Data; Bighorn
Sheep; Land Grants, Acequias, and Commu-
nity Ditches; and Public Access.
Recreation Fee Authority.—The one-year
extension of recreation fee authority for the
Department of the Interior and U.S. Forest
Service contained in the budget request and
included in both fiscal year 2018 House and
Senate Interior, Environment, and Related
Agencies Appropriations bills was included
in the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018
and Supplemental Appropriations for Dis-
aster Relief Requirements Act, 2017 (Public
Law 115–56).
Making Litigation Costs Transparent.—
The Department of the Interior, EPA, and
the Forest Service are directed to provide to
the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations, and to make publicly available no
later than 60 days after enactment of this
Act, detailed Equal Access to Justice Act
(EAJA) fee information as specified in the
explanatory statement accompanying Divi-
sion G of the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2017 (Public Law 115–31).
White-Nose Syndrome.—The four Federal
land management agencies and the U.S. Geo-
logical Survey are expected to continue to
prioritize research on, and efforts to address,
white-nose syndrome in bats and to work
with other Federal, State, and non-govern-
mental partners to implement the North
American Bat Monitoring Program.
Multi-Agency Transparency.—The Com-
mittees support increasing transparency
within all agencies of the Department of the
Interior, the Forest Service and the Environ-
mental Protection Agency. These agencies
are encouraged to disclose costs associated
with analyses required by the National Envi-
ronmental Policy Act.
Paper Reduction Efforts.—The Committees
urge the Department of the Interior, EPA,
Forest Service, and Indian Health Service to
work with the Office of Management and
Budget to reduce printing and reproduction
costs and direct each agency to report to the
Committees within 90 days of enactment of
this Act on steps being undertaken to
achieve this goal and how much each agency
expects to save by implementing these meas-
ures.
Alaska National Interest Lands Conserva-
tion Act (ANILCA) Training.—The Depart-
ment of the Interior and the Forest Service
shall follow the directive in Senate Report
114–281 regarding ANILCA training for agen-
cy employees.
Transparency of Information.—The Com-
mittees expect that Federal agencies funded
under this Act shall, to the extent prac-
ticable, clearly state within materials used
for advertising or educational purposes that
the communication is funded by taxpayer
dollars.
Fleet Management Practices.—Agencies
shall provide supporting documentation on
their methods for determining their optimal
fleet inventories and justification for any de-
viation from the General Services Adminis-
tration’s Federal Property Management Reg-
ulations upon request of the Committees.
Agency inspectors general shall provide re-
sults from audits of fleet management prac-
tices and make them publicly available.
Invasive Species.—The Department of the
Interior is directed to provide a written re-
port to the Committees within 180 days of
enactment of this Act, detailing the funds
appropriated and expended, actions taken,
and outputs achieved for the early detection
of and rapid response to invasive species, as
prescribed in the National Invasive Species
Council Management Plan, 2016–2018.
Delivery of Reports and Correspondence.—
All reports, correspondence, and reprogram-
ming requests from the agencies to the Com-
mittees shall be provided in both physical
and electronic formats.
Youth Partnership Programs.—The Sec-
retary of the Interior and the Secretary of
Agriculture are encouraged to utilize, where
practicable, youth partnership programs like
the Public Lands Corps, Youth Conservation
Corps, Student Conservation Association,
Job Corps and other related partnerships
with Federal, State, local, tribal or non-prof-
it groups that serve young adults.
Land and Water Conservation Fund.—The
agreement includes $425,000,000 derived from
the Land and Water Conservation Fund
(LWCF) for programs consistent with chap-
ter 2003 of title 54 of the United States Code,
as identified in the table below.

There is bipartisan support for the Land
and Water Conservation Fund and this agree-
ment includes funding for State assistance
and new land acquisition projects. The Com-
mittees expect the agencies to move forward
with all projects specifically identified and
funded through this agreement and those
funded in previous fiscal years; to utilize
funding in a timely manner; and to seek Con-
gressional approval for reprogramming unob-
ligated balances if applicable. Agencies are
directed to continue their longstanding proc-
ess of identifying and prioritizing potential
Federal land acquisition projects in anticipa-
tion of program appropriations as consistent
with previous years. Within 30 days of enact-
ment of this Act, each agency is directed to
submit to the Committees a prioritized list
of projects for fiscal year 2019 consideration.
In future years, the agencies are directed to
submit their lists within 30 days of the Presi-
dent’s budget submission to Congress.
The Committees believe increasing access
to our public lands for hunting, fishing, and
other recreational activities is important
and again include funding for these projects.
The Committees expect recreational access
projects to be selected based on their role in
meeting key recreation needs and the agen-
cies should work with their respective re-
gions, State offices, and/or management
units to identify potential projects. The
Committees are to be informed about the se-
lection process and how the agencies are
meeting the outlined objectives prior to pro-
ceeding with projects. Further, the agencies
are again directed to include in future budg-
et justifications an explanation of the proc-
ess used for allocating funds for recreational
access in the previous year.
National Ocean Policy.—The Committees
direct the Department of the Interior to
identify by agency and account, and submit
no later than 60 days after enactment of this
Act, all funding and associated actions in the

President’s budget submission for fiscal year
2019, proposed for the implementation of the
coastal and marine spatial planning and eco-
system-based management components of
the National Ocean Policy developed under
Executive Order 13547.
REPROGRAMMING GUIDELINES
The following are the procedures governing
reprogramming actions for programs and ac-
tivities funded in the Department of the In-
terior, Environment, and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act. The Committees remind
the agencies funded in this Act that these re-
programming guidelines are in effect, and
must be complied with, until such time as
the Committees modify them through bill or
report language.
Definitions.—‘‘Reprogramming,’’ as de-
fined in these procedures, includes the re-
allocation of funds from one budget activity,
budget line-item, or program area, to an-
other within any appropriation funded in
this Act. In cases where either the House or
Senate Committee report displays an alloca-
tion of an appropriation below that level,
that more detailed level shall be the basis for
reprogramming.
For construction, land acquisition, and for-
est legacy accounts, a reprogramming con-
stitutes the reallocation of funds, including
unobligated balances, from one construction,
land acquisition, or forest legacy project to
another such project.
A reprogramming shall also consist of any
significant departure from the program de-
scribed in the agency’s budget justifications.
This includes proposed reorganizations, espe-
cially those of significant national or re-
gional importance, even without a change in
funding. Any change to the organization
table presented in the budget justification
shall be subject to this requirement.
The Committees are aware that agencies
funded by this Act are currently working to
implement Executive Order 13781, a Com-
prehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Execu-
tive Branch, and have included in the fiscal
year 2019 budget request a number of signifi-
cant reorganization proposals for the Com-
mittees’ consideration. The Committees are
also aware of reports that agencies funded by
this Act may be weighing additional organi-
zational changes during the remainder of
this fiscal year. Agencies are reminded that
this agreement continues longstanding Gen-
eral Guidelines for Reprogramming that re-
quire agencies funded by this Act to submit
reorganization proposals for Committee re-
view prior to their implementation. It is
noted that such reprogramming guidelines
apply to proposed reorganizations, workforce
restructure, reshaping or transfer of func-
tions presented in the budget justifications,
or bureau-wide downsizing, especially those
of significant national or regional impor-
tance, and include closures, consolidations,
and relocations of offices, facilities, and lab-
oratories presented in the budget justifica-
tions. In addition, no agency shall imple-
ment any part of a reorganization that modi-
fies regional or State boundaries for agencies
or bureaus that were in effect as of the date
of enactment of this Act unless approved
consistent with the General Guidelines for
Reprogramming procedures specified herein.
Any such reprogramming request submitted
to the Committees on Appropriations shall
include a description of anticipated benefits,
including anticipated efficiencies and cost-
savings, as well as a description of antici-
pated personnel impacts and funding changes
anticipated to implement the proposal.
General Guidelines for Reprogramming.—
(a) A reprogramming should be made only
when an unforeseen situation arises, and
then only if postponement of the project or
the activity until the next appropriation
year would result in actual loss or damage.
(b) Any project or activity, which may be
deferred through reprogramming, shall not
later be accomplished by means of further
reprogramming, but instead, funds should
again be sought for the deferred project or
activity through the regular appropriations
process.
(c) Except under the most urgent situa-
tions, reprogramming should not be em-
ployed to initiate new programs or increase
allocations specifically denied or limited by
Congress, or to decrease allocations specifi-
cally increased by the Congress.
(d) Reprogramming proposals submitted to
the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations for approval shall be considered ap-
proved 30 calendar days after receipt if the
Committees have posed no objection. How-
ever, agencies will be expected to extend the
approval deadline if specifically requested by
either Committee.
Criteria and Exceptions.—A reprogram-
ming must be submitted to the Committees
in writing prior to implementation if it ex-
ceeds $1,000,000 annually or results in an in-
crease or decrease of more than 10 percent
annually in affected programs or projects,
whichever amount is less, with the following
exceptions:
(a) With regard to the tribal priority allo-
cations of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)
and Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), there
is no restriction on reprogrammings among
these programs. However, the Bureaus shall
report on all reprogrammings made during a
given fiscal year no later than 60 days after
the end of the fiscal year.
(b) With regard to the EPA, the Commit-
tees do not require reprogramming requests
associated with the States and Tribes Part-
nership Grants, or up to a cumulative total
of $30,000,000 from carryover balances among
the individual program areas delineated in
the Environmental Programs and Manage-
ment account. No funds, however, shall be
reallocated from individual Geographic Pro-
grams.
Assessments.—‘‘Assessment’’ as defined in
these procedures shall refer to any charges,
reserves, or holdbacks applied to a budget
activity or budget line item for costs associ-
ated with general agency administrative
costs, overhead costs, working capital ex-
penses, or contingencies.
(a) No assessment shall be levied against
any program, budget activity, subactivity,
budget line item, or project funded by the In-
terior, Environment, and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act unless such assessment
and the basis therefor are presented to the
Committees on Appropriations in the budget
justifications and are subsequently approved
by the Committees. The explanation for any
assessment in the budget justification shall
show the amount of the assessment, the ac-
tivities assessed, and the purpose of the
funds.
(b) Proposed changes to estimated assess-
ments, as such estimates were presented in
annual budget justifications, shall be sub-
mitted through the reprogramming process
and shall be subject to the same dollar and
reporting criteria as any other reprogram-
ming.
(c) The Committees direct that each agen-
cy or bureau which utilizes assessments shall
submit an annual report to the Committees
which provides details on the use of all funds
assessed from any other budget activity, line
item, subactivity, or project.
(d) In no case shall contingency funds or
assessments be used to finance projects and
activities disapproved or limited by Con-
gress, or to finance programs or activities
that could be foreseen and included in the
normal budget review process.
(e) New programs requested in the budget
should not be initiated before enactment of
the bill without notification to, and the ap-
proval of, the Committees on Appropria-
tions. This restriction applies to all such ac-
tions regardless of whether a formal re-
programming of funds is required to begin
the program.
Quarterly Reports.—All reprogrammings
between budget activities, budget line-items,
program areas, or the more detailed activity
levels shown in this agreement, including
those below the monetary thresholds estab-
lished above, shall be reported to the Com-
mittees within 60 days of the end of each
quarter and shall include cumulative totals
for each budget activity, budget line item, or
construction, land acquisition, or forest leg-
acy project.
Land Acquisitions, Easements, and Forest
Legacy.—Lands shall not be acquired for
more than the approved appraised value (as
addressed in section 301(3) of Public Law 91–
646), unless such acquisitions are submitted
to the Committees on Appropriations for ap-
proval in compliance with these procedures.
Land Exchanges.—Land exchanges, where-
in the estimated value of the Federal lands
to be exchanged is greater than $1,000,000,
shall not be consummated until the Commit-
tees have had a 30-day period in which to ex-
amine the proposed exchange. In addition,
the Committees shall be provided advance
notification of exchanges valued between
$500,000 and $1,000,000.
Budget Structure.—The budget activity or
line item structure for any agency appro-
priation account shall not be altered without
advance approval of the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations.
Fiscal Year 2019 Process.—Historically, the
Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act has not included re-
programming direction in bill language.
However, this historical practice is not con-
sistent with the majority of other Appropria-
tions subcommittees’ bills. Therefore, the
Committees plan to consider including bill
language in fiscal year 2019. The agencies are
therefore strongly encouraged to work col-
laboratively with the Committees to develop
language in order to avoid any barriers to
implementation.
TITLE I—DEPARTMENT OF THE
INTERIOR
BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT
MANAGEMENT OF LANDS AND RESOURCES
Bureau of Land Management Directives.—
The Bureau is reminded of the importance of
the directives included in House Report 115–
238 not addressed herein, as well as the new
directives in this explanatory statement, in-
cluding the front matter.
The agreement provides $1,166,043,000 for
Management of Lands and Resources. Within
this amount, the agreement includes an ad-
ditional $50,000,000 for deferred maintenance.
The Committees direct that the Bureau pro-
vide a report no later than October 1, 2018, on
the projects to be funded with this funding.
The Committees also note that there is
$5,465,000 in unobligated balances in the Con-
struction appropriation, which was discon-
tinued in fiscal year 2014. To augment the
new funds for deferred maintenance, the Bu-
reau is directed to utilize these Construction
funds for deferred maintenance projects and
to submit a reprogramming request to the
Committees, as necessary, to fully obligate
the prior year balances in fiscal year 2018.
In addition to the funding allocation table
at the end of this explanatory statement, the
agreement includes the following instruc-
tions:
Wild Horses and Burros.—The Committees
are extremely disappointed that the Depart-
ment has failed to provide a comprehensive
plan, as directed by the Consolidated Appro-
priations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115–31) to address
VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:28 Mar 28, 2018 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00566 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A22MR7.046 H22MRPT2
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2611
March 22, 2018
the fast-rising costs of the Wild Horse and
Burro program and overpopulation of wild
horses and burros on the range. The failure
to address these problems is irresponsible
and will result in irreparable damage to the
landscape and the welfare of the animals pro-
tected by the Wild Free-Roaming Horse and
Burro Act. The Committees reiterate their
belief that there is no one solution to the
problems with this program, and that Con-
gress and the Administration must work to-
gether to correct them. Until the Depart-
ment provides a comprehensive plan and any
corresponding legislative proposals to the
appropriate authorizing committees, the
Committees will maintain the existing pro-
hibitions and reduce the resources available
for the program. Reprogramming requests
will only be considered for urgent needs. At
a minimum, the Committees expect a
science-based, detailed plan that 1) reduces
the complexity and cost of contracting poli-
cies and procedures; 2) eliminates unneces-
sary environmental reviews; 3) simplifies and
expands the use of partnerships and coopera-
tive agreements; 4) identifies statutory and
regulatory barriers to implementing the
plan; and 5) has the goal of reducing costs
while improving the health and welfare of
wild horses and burros, and the range. The
Committees direct the Department to pro-
vide the report within 30 days of enactment
of this Act.
Greater Sage-grouse.—The agreement pro-
vides $60,000,000 for greater sage-grouse and
related sage-steppe conservation activities.
This is equal to the amount of base funding
provided in fiscal year 2017. The Bureau is
encouraged to continue working with States
and other interested entities on the existing
sage-grouse conservation plans and to im-
prove the condition of the sage-steppe eco-
system.
Energy and Minerals.—The agreement pro-
vides sufficient funding, within the total
made available, to complete the next cluster
of legacy well remediation. Congress is close-
ly following the litigation regarding the
Waste Prevention, Production Subject to
Royalties, and Resource Conservation regu-
lation and directs the Bureau to provide a re-
port on the costs and staffing needs associ-
ated with it, within 30 days of enactment of
this Act, to help the Committees prepare for
the fiscal year 2019 appropriations process.
Onshore Orders #3 and #4.—The Commit-
tees are aware that the Bureau is working
with affected industries and other interested
stakeholders regarding these Orders and ex-
pect that the Bureau will expeditiously re-
solve any remaining issues consistent with
current law.
Required Reports.—The Bureau is re-
minded that the reports to Congress required
by 42 U.S.C. 15924(e) are due on February 1
annually, and therefore is directed to submit
the reports for 2016 and 2017 no later than 30
days after the date of enactment of this Act.
Realty and Ownership Management.—The
agreement provides $1,000,000 for surveys
along the Red River in Oklahoma and Texas.
Chaco Canyon Regional Management
Plan.—The Bureau is directed to continue its
collaborative work with the Bureau of Indian
Affairs in the Greater Chaco Canyon area
and to maintain current management prac-
tices surrounding Chaco Culture National
Historical Park while a new resource man-
agement planning process to protect cultural
and historical resources is completed.
Rio Puerco Watershed.—The Bureau is en-
couraged to continue supporting the Rio
Puerco Watershed Committee’s work to
identify and implement projects to restore
the watershed.
Resource Management Planning.—The
agreement provides $60,125,000 for resource
management planning, which is $8,000,000
above the fiscal year 2017 level. The Bureau
is directed to focus these additional re-
sources on greater sage-grouse, sage-steppe,
and other high priority conservation areas.
Committee Directives.—The Bureau is di-
rected to continue to follow the directions
included in the explanatory statement ac-
companying the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2017 (P.L. 115–31) related to Cooperative
Efforts in Alaska, Tribal Coordination, and
Red River Land Ownership. The Bureau also
is directed to comply with the timelines re-
quired in the Alaska National Interest Land
Conservation Act (ANILCA) and complete
environmental reviews, after local consulta-
tion and subsistence impact reviews, as it re-
lates to the consideration of the application
for the road from Dalton Highway to the
Ambler Mining District, as well as continue
the directions included in the explanatory
statement accompanying the Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114–113) re-
lated to placer mining.
Soda Ash.—The Committees are concerned
about maintaining the United States’ global
competitiveness in the production of natural
soda ash. The United States contains ap-
proximately 90 percent of the world’s natural
soda ash deposits, while many international
competitors are producing synthetic soda
ash using more energy and generating higher
emissions than natural soda ash production.
Therefore, the Committees expect the Bu-
reau to consider using its authority to re-
duce the Federal royalty rate for soda ash to
2 percent.
LAND ACQUISITION
The bill provides $24,916,000 for Land Ac-
quisition. The amounts provided by this bill
compared with the budget estimates by ac-
tivity and project are shown in the table
below, listed in priority order pursuant to
the project list received for fiscal year 2018.
Further instructions are contained under the
Land and Water Conservation Fund heading
in the front of this explanatory statement.
The Committees note that almost none of
the fiscal year 2017 land acquisition funding
for the Bureau has been spent through the
first quarter of fiscal year 2018, and are con-
cerned about delays in project completions.
The Committees expect all projects, particu-
larly those in project areas identified by
Congress in this report and in previous fiscal
years, to be completed as expeditiously as
possible.

UNITED STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
The bill provides $1,279,002,000 for Resource
Management. All programs and activities,
including youth programs and cooperative
recovery grants, are funded at the amounts
proposed in the budget request to the Con-
gress unless otherwise specified below or in
the table at the end of this division. The
Service is expected to comply with the in-
structions and requirements at the begin-
ning of this division, in addition to the fol-
lowing:
Endangered Species Act (ESA).—The Com-
mittees support and reiterate the guidance
and directives beginning on page 12 of House
Report 115–238, aimed at improving and in-
creasing collaboration with States and other
partners in all stages of ESA implementa-
tion. Such collaboration ensures lasting con-
servation success and upholds the integrity
of the ESA, which is premised upon the Fed-
eral Government working with the States
and other partners to recover species and
subsequently remove Federal protections.
As the Service indicated in its fiscal year
2017 budget request, ‘‘Given the growing
number of listed species—limited resources
force the Recovery Program to make dif-
ficult tradeoffs among these activities in-
cluding 5-year reviews, developing recovery
plans, implementing recovery actions,
delisting and downlisting, all of which are
necessary to achieve recovery.’’ Such trade-
offs have led to backlogs of 837 species (53
percent) without a current 5-year review,
and 49 species awaiting downlisting or
delisting, and have contributed to a common
sentiment that, once a species is put on the
list, it doesn’t come off. Such sentiment has
made for reluctant State and local partners,
adding further strain to the Service’s budget
and making recovery more difficult. Though
the Service is to be commended for having
made progress on these backlogs in recent

years, it cannot eliminate these backlogs
without additional help.
Flexibilities already inherent in the ESA
allow the Service to collaborate and benefit
from partner expertise and on-the-ground
conservation, and the Service, to its credit,
already does a considerable amount of that
in some regions. But the Committees also
recognize that several States and non-gov-
ernmental partners have indicated a willing-
ness to increase their involvement when the
Federal Government is a willing and equal
partner. The aim of this fiscal year 2018 ap-
propriation is twofold: 1) to foster a more
open, transparent, and collaborative ESA
process; and 2) to begin to shift the workload
by incentivizing increased involvement by
States and other partners in activities such
as species status assessments, and recovery
planning and implementation, so the Service
can prioritize the ESA responsibilities that
are inherently Federal.
Ecological Services.—The agreement pro-
vides $247,825,000 for programs and activities
within Ecological Services, as discussed
below.
Listing.—The agreement provides
$18,818,000 for status assessments, listings,
critical habitat determinations, and related
activities. Bill language funding limitations
are consolidated under one cap.
The Committees urge the Service to avoid
entering into any multi-species settlement
agreement unless the State and local govern-
ments where the species are located are a
party to that agreement.
The Service is urged to continue to follow
the guidance contained in House Report 114–
170 regarding the yellow-billed cuckoo.
The Service is directed to develop a plan to
improve transparency of the underlying data
it uses to make determinations for species
listings and de-listing activities before the
end of fiscal year 2018, including details on
how the Service will publish data and mate-
rials used in listing determinations on the
Internet and improve what is currently
available on www.regulations.gov and the
Service website.
The Committees expect the Service to
work with the States to develop a more rea-
sonable policy whereby the Service’s regu-
latory assurance criteria include responsible
land management commitments by private
landowners, as described in further detail in
House Report 115–238.
The Committees are concerned that the
Service has not fully incorporated tradi-
tional Tribal knowledge in its implementa-
tion of the ESA. When appropriate, the Com-
mittees expect the Service to make every ef-
fort to incorporate traditional knowledge in
ESA decisions. The Committees also expect
the Service to engage in additional outreach
to Tribal governments in circumstances
where traditional knowledge may provide
valuable information, including for species
like the northern sea otter. The Service
should brief the Committees on its efforts re-
garding traditional knowledge within 60 days
of enactment of this Act.
Planning and Consultation.—The agree-
ment provides $105,579,000 for project permit-
ting and consultation activities. A program
increase of $2,500,000 is included to avoid per-
mitting delays and to achieve compliance
with other statutes, and should be appor-
tioned in accordance with workload needs
nationwide rather than by region. Funding
for all other program elements within this
subactivity are restored to the fiscal year
2017 enacted levels, including $4,000,000 for
Gulf Coast restoration. Because the Commit-
tees have provided substantial resources for
Gulf Coast restoration, the Service is ex-
pected to move forward with project reviews
in a timely manner. The Service is also en-
couraged to evaluate establishing a reim-
bursement policy to recover costs for work
required by statute for projects funded by fu-
ture disaster settlements.
The Committees support the continuation
of collaborative efforts in the Pacific North-
west with the National Marine Fisheries
Service, the Washington Department of Fish
and Wildlife, and affected Tribes that will re-
sult in the completion of all Puget Sound
hatchery program consultations by the Fall,
2018.
The Service is encouraged to place a pri-
ority on providing technical assistance to
partners making good faith efforts to de-
velop and implement responsible habitat
conservation plans as authorized by the
ESA.
The Service is urged to address consulta-
tions and permitting of public and private
projects related to the Preble’s meadow
jumping mouse as one of the highest prior-
ities.
Conservation and Restoration.—The agree-
ment provides $32,396,000 for conservation
and restoration activities. Funding for all
program elements within this subactivity
are restored to the fiscal year 2017 enacted
levels.
The Service is expected to focus Candidate
Conservation funding on the annual Can-
didate Notice of Review as required by the
ESA, providing technical assistance to
States and others, and developing agree-
ments that provide regulatory certainty to
landowners. The Service should look to its
other programs and its partners to fund and
implement conservation activities on the
ground. The Service is commended for its ef-
forts in the Southeast to work with States
and others to preclude the need to list many
of the hundreds of species recently peti-
tioned for listing, and is expected to expand
this model nationwide.
Recovery.—The agreement provides
$91,032,000 for activities in support of the re-
covery and delisting of threatened and en-
dangered species, with continued funding for
the following program elements at or above
the fiscal year 2017 enacted levels: Bay Delta,
$1,659,000; white nose syndrome, $2,000,000;
State of the Birds, $3,000,000; and the wolf-
livestock loss demonstration program,
$1,000,000. States with de-listed wolf popu-
lations shall continue to be eligible for fund-
ing, provided that those States continue to
meet the eligibility criteria contained in
Public Law 111–11.
General program activities are funded at
$74,000,000. The Service is expected to focus
the funds on inherently Federal activities
such as recovery plan approvals, the backlog
of five-year reviews, status changes, and as-
sociated collaboration with States and other
partners. An additional $4,373,000 is provided
to propose and finalize rules for the backlog
of species with completed 5-year reviews that
recommend delisting and downlisting.
In developing and implementing recovery
plans, the Service is directed to make full
use of its authority under section 4(f)(2) of
the ESA to ‘‘procure the services of appro-
priate public and private agencies and insti-
tutions, and other qualified persons.’’ While
recovery plan approval and delisting deci-
sions ultimately rest with the Service and
make collaboration essential to success, plan
development and implementation are not in-
herently Federal. Species recovery is a
shared responsibility that does not default to
the Fish and Wildlife Service. Where able
partners are willing to increase or lead these
efforts, the Service is expected to shift to
supportive roles through technical assist-
ance and cost-shared grants.
To expand partnerships through cost-
shared grants, the agreement includes pro-
gram increases within the Cooperative En-
dangered Species Conservation Fund and
State and Tribal Wildlife Grants. In addi-
tion, $5,000,000 is provided in Resource Man-
agement for Recovery Challenge matching
grants to enhance and increase partnerships
with agencies and organizations imple-
menting highest priority recovery actions as
prescribed in recovery plans, and in par-
ticular for genetically-sound breeding,
rearing, and reintroduction programs. Long-
standing partnerships, including for the
northern aplomado falcon, California condor,
and Steller’s eider, should be funded at not
less than $2,000,000 and partner contributions
should be not less than their current
amounts. The remaining funds should be
dedicated to new partnerships and should re-
quire a 50:50 match, which may include in-
kind services. Unless an affected State is a
partner on the project, none of the funds
may be awarded to a project until the
project partners have consulted with such
State. The Service is strongly encouraged to
transfer similar recovery plan implementa-
tion partnerships to Recovery Challenge
grants in future budget requests, so that all
other Recovery funds in the Resource Man-
agement account are prioritized to ensure
accomplishment of inherently Federal func-
tions.
The Service is urged to work with the
State of Utah on a mutually agreeable plan
to recover the Utah prairie dog, as discussed
in House Report 115–238.
The Committees are aware that the Serv-
ice is currently undertaking a required sta-
tus review of the American Burying Beetle
to determine whether listing as an endan-
gered species is still warranted. Within funds
provided, the Service is directed to propose a
rule by the end of the fiscal year to delist or
downlist the American Burying Beetle
should the status review make a finding that
delisting or downlisting is warranted.
The Committees acknowledge the impor-
tant roles that science and Federal wildlife
biologists have in the Service’s decisions to
recover species. The Service’s Science pro-
gram is directed to initiate a study not later
than 90 days after the date of enactment of
this Act, through a qualified independent en-
tity such as the Smithsonian Institution, to
determine whether or not animals currently
classified as red wolves and Mexican gray
wolves are taxonomically valid species and
subspecies designations, respectively. The
study shall include publication of a scientific
literature review, including genetic research,
not later than one year after the date of en-
actment of this Act and, if the literature is
inconclusive, shall include any additional
necessary research and publication not later
than three years after the date of enactment
of this Act. In the meantime, the Service’s
Recovery program is reminded of its legal
mandate to cooperate to the maximum ex-
tent practicable with the States, especially
when there has been conflict between species
and private property owners. As such, the
Service is directed to continue working
closely with the North Carolina Wildlife Re-
sources Commission on management of red
wolves in fiscal year 2018.
The Service should seek the most current
science as it works to implement the agree-
ment between the United States and the
Russian Federation on management of the
Alaska-Chukotka Polar Bear Population.
The Service is expected to consult with and
incorporate traditional knowledge from
Alaska Native Organizations on matters re-
lated to subsistence hunting, and to work
with Alaska Native Organizations and other
wildlife management organizations with ex-
pertise in subsistence hunting to implement
a civil-based, co-management regime.
Habitat Conservation.—The agreement
provides $65,008,000 for habitat conservation
programs, of which $51,633,000 is for the Part-
ners for Fish and Wildlife program and

$13,375,000 is for the Coastal Program. All
program elements within these two sub-
activities are restored to fiscal year 2017 en-
acted levels, except as discussed in the open-
ing paragraph, including $1,285,000 for fish-
eries enhancement. The Chesapeake Bay Nu-
tria Eradication Project is funded at
$1,725,000.
National Wildlife Refuge System.—The
agreement provides $486,757,000 for the Na-
tional Wildlife Refuge System and maintains
subactivities and program elements at fiscal
year 2017 enacted levels, except where identi-
fied in the opening paragraph or described
below.
Wildlife and Habitat Management.—The
agreement includes: $2,835,000 to manage sub-
sistence fishing and hunting; $10,000,000 for
invasive species, including $75,000 for the
Chesapeake Bay Nutria Eradication Project;
$1,500,000 for the Pacific Remote Islands Ma-
rine National Monument; and $196,089,000 for
general program activities which includes
the absorption of the former Healthy Habi-
tats and Populations initiative.
The agreement supports the directive in
House Report 114–632 instituting signage on
any individual refuge where trapping occurs
and establishing guidance to be included in
the refuge manual. Until the Committees are
notified in writing that all directives are
complied with, $2,000,000 of the funding pro-
vided for Wildlife and Habitat Management
is not available for obligation.
The Service is reminded of the directive
contained in House Report 115–238 regarding
the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration
Plan.
The Service is expected to follow the direc-
tive from previous fiscal years that prohibits
a caribou hunt on Kagalaska Island and ef-
forts to remove cattle on Chirikof and
Wosnesenski Islands in the State of Alaska.
Visitor Services.—The agreement includes
$2,000,000 for the youth program. Funding has
been provided to continue the Urban Wildlife
Refuge Partnership program at the fiscal
year 2017 enacted level and to support efforts
to promote conservation in urban areas. The
Committees encourage the Service to con-
sider prioritizing funding for a new visitor
center at the Canaan Valley National Wild-
life Refuge. The Service is directed to brief
the Committees on options for preserving
historic aircraft located within the World
War II Valor in the Pacific National Monu-
ment on Atka Island in Alaska within 90
days of enactment of this Act. The Commit-
tees encourage the Service to work with
local stakeholders and consider prioritizing
enhancements at the Wheeler National Wild-
life Refuge in its internal budget processes—
including new trails, visitor center exhibits,
and other infrastructure priorities—to im-
prove the visitor experience for the increas-
ing number of visitors at the refuge.
Conservation Planning.—The Service is en-
couraged to work with affected landowners
to address concerns about the acquisition
boundary for Bitter Creek National Wildlife
Refuge, as discussed in House Report 115–238.
The agreement directs the Service to ap-
prove the establishment of the Green River
National Wildlife Refuge in the Green River
Bottoms area near the confluence of the
Green River and Ohio River in Henderson
County, Kentucky. The refuge should consist
of approximately 24,000 acres—to be acquired
from willing landowners. The Service should
partner with other stakeholders on estab-
lishment of the refuge and look for opportu-
nities related to environmental mitigation
for interstate bridge construction projects in
the area. The Service is directed to wait to
establish final boundaries of the refuge until
the new I–69 interstate bridge corridor is se-
lected. Within 120 days of the date of enact-
ment of this Act, the Service is directed to
report to the Committees on its progress to-
ward establishment of the refuge.
Refuge Maintenance.—The agreement in-
cludes $42,901,000 to reduce the backlog of de-
ferred maintenance and $649,000 to continue
the Youth Conservation Corps. The Service
is encouraged to consider prioritizing repairs
of water control structures at the Don
Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wild-
life Refuge.
Conservation and Enforcement.—The
agreement provides $141,290,000 for other con-
servation and enforcement programs as de-
scribed below.
Migratory Bird Management.—The agree-
ment provides $48,421,000 to continue all Mi-
gratory Bird Management programs at or
above fiscal year 2017 enacted levels, includ-
ing: $2,000,000 for aviation safety; $350,000 to
manage bird-livestock conflicts; and
$3,424,000 to expedite permits. The Service is
commended for its efforts to work with land-
owners to reduce black vulture predation on
livestock.
Law Enforcement.—The agreement pro-
vides $77,053,000 to continue all law enforce-
ment programs at fiscal year 2017 enacted
levels and includes a $2,000,000 increase for
wildlife inspectors at ports currently with-
out personnel, in order to deter illegal ac-
tivities and to ensure that legal trade is not
significantly slowed because of a lack of
Service personnel. Wildlife trafficking en-
forcement activities continue to be funded at
$7,500,000, which may also be used as needed
to supplement inspections. The Service is di-
rected to enforce illegal logging violations
pursuant to the Lacey Act. From within gen-
eral program activities, funding is provided
to continue the Service’s work with the In-
dian Arts and Crafts Board to combat inter-
national trafficking of counterfeit arts and
crafts and to conduct criminal investigations
of alleged violations of the Indian Arts and
Crafts Act.
The Committees support efforts outlined in
House Report 115–238 for the Service to col-
laborate with U.S. Customs and Border Pro-
tection on the Automated Commercial Envi-
ronment (ACE).
International Affairs.—The agreement pro-
vides $15,816,000 and continues all program
elements at the fiscal year 2017 enacted lev-
els, including $550,000 to support the Arctic
Council.
As outlined in House Report 115–238, the
Committees encourage the Service to con-
tinue to work with stakeholders to address
their concerns related to international trade
in wood and wood products and advance ef-
forts to develop a domestic electronic per-
mitting system and an electronic form for
data collection to expedite processing of licit
imports and exports of these products.
The Committees recognize the Service’s
work with Mexico and Central American na-
tions and urge the continuation of these
international partnerships.
Within 150 days of enactment of this Act,
the Committees expect the report directed in
House Report 115–238 on the CITES permit-
ting process for live plants and the analysis
of actions that could create efficiencies.
Fish and Aquatic Conservation.—The
agreement provides $164,627,000 for fish and
aquatic conservation programs and main-
tains subactivities and program elements at
fiscal year 2017 enacted levels, except where
identified in the opening paragraph or de-
scribed below. The Service is expected to
continue its tradition of improving fresh-
water subsistence, commercial, and rec-
reational fishing since 1871.
National Fish Hatchery System Oper-
ations.—The agreement provides $55,822,000
and includes: $550,000 to implement the Great
Lakes Consent Decree; $1,430,000 for the na-
tional wild fish health survey program;
$1,475,000 to continue mass marking
salmonids in the Pacific Northwest; and
$1,200,000 for the Aquatic Animal Drug Ap-
proval Partnership. None of the funds may
be used to terminate operations or to close
any facility of the National Fish Hatchery
System. None of the production programs
listed in the March 2013 National Fish Hatch-
ery System Strategic Hatchery and Work-
force Planning Report may be reduced or ter-
minated without advance, informal consulta-
tion with affected States and Tribes.
The Service is expected to continue fund-
ing mitigation hatchery programs via reim-
bursable agreements with Federal partners.
Future agreements should include reim-
bursement for production, facilities, and ad-
ministrative costs. The Service is expected
to ensure that its costs are fully reimbursed
before proposing to reduce or redirect base
funding.
Maintenance and Equipment.—The agree-
ment provides $22,920,000 which includes
$13,249,000 to reduce the deferred mainte-
nance backlog, and, in addition to amounts
provided in the Construction account, fund-
ing should continue to be allocated to facili-
ties with the most severe health and safety
deficiencies across the System as a whole,
rather than by region. All other funds should
continue to be allocated as in prior years and
should include mitigation hatcheries as
needed to supplement reimbursable funds.
Habitat Assessment and Restoration.—The
agreement provides $33,987,000, which in-
cludes $13,998,000 for the National Fish Pas-
sage Program, $3,000,000 to implement the
Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement, and
$5,000,000 to implement the Delaware River
Basin Conservation Act (DRBCA). Within 90
days of enactment of this Act, the Service is
directed to brief the Committees on its ef-
forts related to the DRBCA. The Service is
directed to be transparent with its partners
regarding Federal costs for program coordi-
nation and administration of the National
Fish Habitat Action Plan.
Population Assessment and Cooperative
Management.—The agreement provides
$30,150,000 which includes $9,554,000 for sub-
sistence fisheries management and $15,635,000
for general program activities, of which
$489,000 is for the Lake Champlain sea lam-
prey program.
Aquatic Invasive Species.—The agreement
includes $21,748,000 for aquatic invasive spe-
cies programs, of which: $1,000,000 is to help
States implement plans required by the Na-
tional Invasive Species Act (NISA); $1,566,000
is for NISA coordination; $3,088,000 is to im-
plement subsection 5(d)(2) of the Lake Tahoe
Restoration Act; $10,400,000 is for controlling
Asian carp in the Mississippi and Ohio River
Basins and preventing them from entering
and establishing in the Great Lakes, includ-
ing $2,000,000 to expand and perfect the com-
bined use of contract fishing and deterrents
to extirpate Asian carp, including grass carp,
where already established; and $2,000,000 is to
prevent the spread of quagga and zebra mus-
sels.
The Committees support efforts to address
threats to aquatic invasive species and direct
the Service to continue to make available
competitive grant funding for projects to
eliminate invasive species, including Asian
carp, quagga and zebra mussels, and vari-
able-leaf watermilfoil. The Service should
continue to support research, monitoring,
and mitigation efforts, as well as efforts to
disseminate such work, in all regions.
Cooperative Landscape Conservation.—The
agreement provides $12,988,000 for coopera-
tive landscape conservation, of which
$1,000,000 is for the Gulf Coast ecosystem.
The Committees recognize the disparate lev-
els of partner support across the States and
expect the Service to focus funding where
partnerships are strong.

Science Support.—The agreement provides
$17,267,000 for the Science Support program
and includes $931,000 to restore the Gulf
Coast ecosystem, and $3,500,000 for white-
nose syndrome in bats. The Service should
continue to co-lead and implement the North
American Bat Monitoring Program with
other Federal, State, and non-governmental
partners. The Service is expected to partner
with Cooperative Research Units whenever
possible.
General Operations.—The agreement pro-
vides $143,240,000 for general operations and
includes funding for central office oper-
ations, regional office operations, and Serv-
ice-wide bill paying at the requested levels.
The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation
is funded at the fiscal year 2017 enacted
level. A one-time program increase of
$4,300,000 is provided for annual maintenance
needs of the National Conservation Training
Center (NCTC). The Committees understand
this funding will fully address backlog main-
tenance at NCTC.
CONSTRUCTION
The bill provides $66,540,000 for Construc-
tion and includes a one-time increase of
$50,000,000 for the backlog of deferred mainte-
nance principally at national fish hatcheries
and national wildlife refuges. The Service is
directed to provide a spend plan to the Com-
mittees within 120 days of enactment of this
Act for the additional deferred maintenance
funding. The detailed allocation of funding
by activity is included in the table at the
end of this explanatory statement. For line-
item construction, the Service is expected to
follow the project priority list in the table
below. When a construction project is com-
pleted or terminated and appropriated funds
remain, the Service may use those balances
to respond to unforeseen reconstruction, re-
placement, or repair of facilities or equip-
ment damaged or destroyed by storms,
floods, fires and similar unanticipated
events.

LAND ACQUISITION
The bill provides $63,839,000 for Land Ac-
quisition. The amounts provided by this bill
compared with the budget estimates by ac-
tivity and project are shown in the table
below, listed in priority order pursuant to
the project list received for fiscal year 2018.
Further instructions are contained under the
Land and Water Conservation Fund heading
in the front of this explanatory statement.
In a time when budgetary constraints
allow for only a limited number of new land
acquisition projects, the Committees are en-
couraged by programs that leverage public/
private partnerships for land conservation
like the Highlands Conservation Act, which
has a record of more than a 2 to 1 ratio in
non-Federal matching funds. Therefore, the
Committees include $10,000,000 for the High-
lands Conservation Act Grants and direct
the Fish and Wildlife Service to work with
the Highlands States regarding priority
projects for fiscal year 2018.
The Committees recognize there are con-
cerns regarding the acquisition and manage-
ment of easements in some States. Any un-
certainty about the scope of management re-
sponsibilities among stakeholders and agen-
cies should be addressed by engaging in a
constructive dialogue and reaching a unified
solution that honors the rights of individual
landowners while implementing sound con-
servation practices. Therefore, in lieu of the
House directive, the Service is strongly en-
couraged to begin this dialogue and brief the
Committees within 60 days of enactment of
this Act on the challenges of the Service har-
monizing current easement laws and regula-
tions with landowners and State govern-
ments with options to resolve these chal-
lenges.

the Cooperative Endangered Species Con-
servation Fund and $19,638,000 is to be de-
rived from the Land and Water Conservation
Fund. The detailed allocation of funding by
activity is included in the table at the end of
this explanatory statement. The Service is
directed to lift the artificial caps and appor-
tion funds to Habitat Conservation Plans
(HCPs) based on need in order to increase on-
the-ground conservation and eliminate unob-
ligated balances. The agreement includes a
program increase of $2,000,000 in traditional
conservation grants in order to foster in-
creased partner involvement in recovery
plan development and implementation,
which is offset by a decrease in HCP plan-
ning assistance grants due to a lack of de-
mand.

NATIONAL PARK SERVICE
OPERATION OF THE NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM
The agreement provides $2,477,969,000 for
the Operation of the National Park System
and includes requested fixed costs. The de-
tailed allocation of funding by program area
and activity is included in the table at the
end of this division.
Operation of the National Park System.—
The bill does not support reductions pro-
posed in the budget request that would di-
minish visitor services and reduce park and
program operations system-wide.
Within Resource Stewardship, the Commit-
tees have restored all proposed reductions to
Everglades restoration efforts and to com-
plete restoration projects at newly estab-
lished park units. The recommendation also
includes $3,000,000 to continue zebra and
quagga mussel containment, prevention, and
enforcement in western water bodies, and
$500,000 for cave and karst ecosystem re-
search. The agreement continues the direc-
tive provided within the Visitor Services line
item contained in House Report 115–238. The
reduction from fiscal year 2017 within Park
Protection is for non-recurring expenses re-
lated to the Presidential Inauguration. The
agreement includes $5,000,000 to support
timely aviation fleet replacement by the
Washington, DC area U.S. Park Police avia-
tion unit which supports law enforcement
and public safety in the national capital re-
gion. Within Facility Operations and Main-
tenance, the Committees have accepted the
Service’s proposal to eliminate the Flex
Park program in order to focus resources on
critical park operations and programs. The
agreement retains funding increases pro-
vided within the Consolidated Appropria-
tions Act, 2017 to address deferred mainte-
nance needs and provides an additional
$15,000,000 to address cyclic maintenance
needs, an additional $10,000,000 for repair and
rehabilitation projects, and an additional
$10,000,000 for project planning. These funds
are supplemented by $23,000,000 provided
within the Centennial Challenge matching
grant program account dedicated to funding
joint public-private investments in parks.
Increases within Park Support are to address
new responsibilities and critical needs at
park units including but not limited to Free-
dom Riders, Castle Mountains, and Bir-
mingham Civil Rights units. The rec-
ommendation also restores proposed reduc-
tions to park units including the Manhattan
Project National Historical Park and
Honouliuli units, and the Partnership Wild
and Scenic River program. Each are funded
at the fiscal year 2017 enacted level. Funding
for the Roosevelt-Campobello International
Park is also maintained at the fiscal year
2017 enacted level.
Quagga and Zebra Mussel Control.—The
Committees remain concerned about the
spread of quagga and zebra mussels in the
West and have provided $3,000,000 for contin-
ued containment, prevention, and enforce-
ment efforts.
Eastern Legacy Study (Lewis and Clark
Trail Study).—The Eastern Legacy Study,
authorized to determine the feasibility of ex-
tending the Lewis and Clark National His-
toric Trail, is now four years overdue. The
Committees direct the Service to complete
the study expeditiously.
Mississippi National River and Recreation
Area.—The agreement maintains the direc-
tive related to the Mississippi National River
and Recreation Area contained in House Re-
port 115–238.
Elwha Water Facilities.—The agreement
includes the directive related to the Elwha
Water Facilities contained in House Report
115–238.
Natchez Visitor Reception Center.—The
Committees understand that the Service is
engaged in discussions with Natchez, MS
over accepting a donation of the Natchez
Visitor Reception Center and encourage the
Service to reach agreement on such donation
in a timely fashion.
National Park Service Local Hire Imple-
mentation.—Within 90 days of enactment of
this Act, the Committees direct the Service
in cooperation with other relevant agencies
to provide a report on numbers of employees
hired in Alaska with the authorities under
the Alaska National Interest Lands Con-
servation Act (ANILCA).
Blackstone River Valley National Histor-
ical Park.—The agreement includes re-
quested funding for the Blackstone River
Valley National Historical Park with the ex-
pectation that the Service will continue to
make funds available to the local coordi-
nating entity to maintain staffing and ca-
pacity to assist in management of the park
as authorized in Public Law 113–291.
Cape Lookout National Seashore.—As the
Service reviews the Cape Lookout National
Seashore’s Off-Road Vehicle Management
Plan, the Committees expect the Service to
adopt the least restrictive land use option
that allows adequate access to the Seashore
while maintaining sufficient protections for
wildlife and natural resources.
National Trails System.—In preparation
for the National Trails System’s 50-year an-
niversary in 2018, the Committees urge the
Service to make funding the construction
and maintenance of national trails a pri-
ority.
Biscayne National Park.—The agreement
maintains the directive related to Biscayne
National Park contained in House Report
115–238.
Everglades Restoration.—The Committees
note the progress made toward restoration of
the Everglades ecosystem and continue to
support this multi-year effort to preserve
one of the great ecological treasures of the
United States.
Vicksburg National Military Park.—The
agreement maintains the directive related to
Vicksburg National Military Park contained
in House Report 115–238.
Arlington Memorial Bridge.—The Commit-
tees commend the Department for its efforts,
working with bipartisan Federal, State, and
local leaders, to secure $227,000,000 to reha-
bilitate the Arlington Memorial Bridge, a
historic and critical transportation link in
the nation’s capital. As awarded, the design-
build contract will save $35,000,000 and accel-
erate the project’s completion by 18 months.
Major construction is scheduled to begin
later in 2018.
Ozark National Scenic Riverways.—The
Service is directed to work collaboratively
with affected parties to ensure that imple-
mentation of the General Management Plan
for the Ozark National Scenic Riverways ad-
dresses the concerns of affected stakeholders
including, but not limited to, local commu-
nities and businesses.
St. Anthony Falls Lock.—The agreement
includes the directive related to St. Anthony
Falls Lock contained in House Report 115–
238.
Yosemite Medical Clinic.—The agreement
maintains the directive related to the Yo-
semite Medical Clinic contained in House
Report 115–238.
Director’s Order 21.—Within 90 days of en-
actment of this Act, the Service shall report
to the Committees on steps it has taken or
plans to take in fiscal year 2018 to imple-
ment Public Law 113–291.
Oklahoma City National Memorial & Mu-
seum.—The Committees direct the Service
to provide a report within 30 days of enact-
ment of this Act indicating what funds have
been allocated to the Memorial and options
to provide the remaining authorized amount.
Alaska Hunting and Trapping.—The Com-
mittees are aware that the National Park
Service intends to initiate a rulemaking
process that will consider changes to the
final rule published October 23, 2015, related
to hunting and trapping in National Pre-
serves in Alaska. This will include identi-
fying ways to address recreational hunting
and fishing cooperation, consultation, and
communication with State of Alaska wildlife
managers. The Committees expect the Serv-
ice to complete the review in a timely man-
ner.
NATIONAL RECREATION AND PRESERVATION
The agreement provides $63,638,000 for Na-
tional Recreation and Preservation with the
following specific directives:
Natural Programs.—The Committees
maintain funding for Natural Programs, in-
cluding the Chesapeake Gateways and Trails
program and Rivers, Trails and Conserva-
tion, at the fiscal year 2017 enacted level.
Cultural Programs.—The Committees pro-
vide $25,062,000 for Cultural Programs, an in-
crease of $500,000 above the enacted level.
The increase is provided for grants to non-
profit organizations or institutions pursuant
to 20 U.S.C. 4451(b). The Committees direct
the Department to consider funding the
Northwest Coast arts program as outlined by
the memorandum of agreement between the
Institute of American Indian Arts and the
Sealaska Heritage Institute. Funding for the
Native American Graves Protection and Re-
patriation Grant Program and the Japanese
American Confinement Site Grant Program
is maintained at the fiscal year 2017 enacted
level.
Heritage Partnership Program.—The
agreement provides $20,321,000 for the Herit-
age Partnership Program. The Committees
continue to encourage individual heritage
areas to develop plans for long-term suffi-
ciency. The Committees commend the Alli-
ance of National Heritage Areas, in response
to Congressional direction, for developing an
allocation model that maintains core serv-
ices of more established areas while pro-
posing additional resources to newer areas.
The Committees note this progress and di-
rect the Service to work with heritage areas
to further develop consensus toward a sus-
tainable funding distribution. As this effort
continues, the Committees expect the Serv-
ice to distribute funds in the same manner as
fiscal year 2017 with the increase above the
enacted level to be equally distributed to
Tier I areas or Tier 2 areas currently receiv-
ing the minimum funding levels of $150,000
and $300,000 respectively.
Muscle Shoals National Heritage Area.—
The Committees encourage the continued
partnership between the Muscle Shoals Re-
gional Center and the University of North
Alabama.
National Heritage Area Feasibility
Study.—The Committees understand that
the Service has no intent to initiate or con-
duct a feasibility study to establish a na-
tional heritage area in Baca, Bent, Crowley,
Huerfano, Kiowa, Las Animas, Otero,
Prowers, and Pueblo counties, Colorado. In
the event the Service alters its intentions,
the Committees direct the Service to notify
the Committees 120 days in advance of initi-
ating such a study.

tained under the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund heading in the front of this ex-
planatory statement.
The Committees continue to support the
American Battlefield Protection Program

CENTENNIAL CHALLENGE
The agreement provides $23,000,000 for the
Centennial Challenge matching grant pro-
gram. The program provides dedicated Fed-
eral funding to leverage partnerships for sig-
nature projects and programs for the na-
tional park system. The Committees expect
these funds to be used by the Service to ad-
dress projects which have a deferred mainte-
nance component in order to alleviate the
sizeable deferred maintenance backlog with-
in the national park system. A one-to-one
matching requirement is required for
projects to qualify for these funds. The Serv-
ice is urged to give preference to projects
that demonstrate additional leveraging ca-
pacity from its partners. From amounts in
the Centennial Challenge account, the Com-
mittees encourage the Department to make
$3,000,000 available for critical programs and
projects, pursuant to 54 U.S.C. 1011 Sub-
chapter II, subject to terms and conditions
outlined in Title VI of Public Law 114–289.
UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY
SURVEYS, INVESTIGATIONS, AND RESEARCH
The bill provides $1,148,457,000 for Surveys,
Investigations, and Research of the U.S. Geo-
logical Survey (USGS, or the Survey). This
includes additional, one-time funding for the
purchase of equipment, infrastructure re-
lated projects, and deferred maintenance
that should not be considered programmatic
increases and for which the Committees ex-
pect a detailed spend plan within 180 days of
enactment of this Act. The detailed alloca-
tion of funding by program area and activity
is included in the table at the end of this ex-
planatory statement.
Congressional Budget Justification.—The
Committees direct the Survey to include in
future justifications base funding and pro-
gram descriptions for any subactivity, pro-
gram, project, or study proposed for in-
creases or reductions.
Ecosystems.—The agreement provides
$157,732,000, and does not include reductions
for program terminations proposed in the
budget request for Status and Trends and the
Wildlife Program. The Survey is directed to
formulate a transition plan with the Smith-
sonian Institution regarding the curation of
the Institution’s collection for which the
Survey is currently responsible.
The agreement also includes an increase of
$500,000 from within available funds to ad-
dress white-nose syndrome in bats. The Com-
mittees are aware of the work the Survey is
performing in critical landscapes such as the
Arctic, Puget Sound, California Bay Delta,
Everglades, Great Lakes, Columbia River,
and the Chesapeake Bay, and expect this
work to continue. The Terrestrial, Fresh-
water, and Marine Environments program is
funded as reported in House Report 115–238,
and species-specific fisheries and Asian carp
funding are maintained at fiscal year 2017 en-
acted levels. The Committees understand
certain programs are nearing completion;
therefore, the Survey is directed to report
back to the Committees within 180 days of
enactment of this Act on anticipated bal-
ances of such programs.
Land Resources.—The agreement provides
$152,499,000, which includes $93,094,000 for the
National Land Imaging activity. Within
these funds, Landsat 9 is fully funded at a
program level of $26,200,000; satellite oper-
ations receive $52,337,000; National Civil Ap-
plications Center receives $4,847,000; and the
AmericaView State grant program receives
$1,215,000.
The Committees accept the proposed budg-
et structure changes with the understanding
that the work previously funded in the fiscal
year 2017 structure will continue at fiscal
year 2017 enacted levels and that the Survey
will continue to track and provide informa-
tion on funding within the Land Change sub-

lines. The Committees provide funding for
the eight regional science centers and grant
awards should be made at the negotiated an-
nual agreement levels. The Survey is di-
rected to provide notification to the Com-
mittees as the grants are awarded in full. As
a result of the budget restructure, $5,025,000
is provided so that work previously funded
under the old budget structure will continue
within the Land Change Science subactivity.
Energy, Minerals, and Environmental
Health.—The agreement provides $102,838,000
for Energy, Minerals, and Environmental
Health, including $1,000,000 toward the do-
mestic mineral base survey and $4,700,000 for
the implementation of Secretarial Order
3352. As a result of the budget restructure,
$1,477,000 is provided for work previously
funded at this level in fiscal year 2017 and
now funded under the Mineral and Energy
Resources subactivity. The Committees ac-
cept the $2,457,000 reduction proposed in the
budget due to the completion of reports as
required by the Energy Independence and Se-
curity Act of 2007 (P.L. 110–140). The Com-
mittees expect geologic and biologic re-
search to continue under the new budget re-
structure.
The Committees continue geophysical and
remote sensing activities at the enacted
funding levels and direct the Survey to con-
tinue this work following the requirements
outlined in the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2017 (P.L. 115–31). The Committees also
expect low permeability reservoir assess-
ments to continue at the 2017 enacted level
and that the Survey will continue to abide
by the directive outlined in Public Law 115–
31 concerning consultation with State geo-
logical surveys.
The agreement provides $12,398,000 for
toxic substances hydrology. The Committees
support the Survey’s comprehensive research
on cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms and
provide an increase of $1,350,000 over the fis-
cal year 2017 enacted level for this effort.
Natural Hazards.—The agreement provides
$178,613,000 for the Natural Hazards Program,
including $83,403,000 for earthquake hazards.
Within this funding, $12,900,000 is provided
for continued development of an earthquake
early warning (EEW) system and for the first
limited public rollout of ShakeAlert, and an
additional $10,000,000 is provided for capital
costs associated with the buildout of the
EEW. Within 60 days of enactment of this
Act, the Survey is directed to provide to the
Committees an updated Technical Imple-
mentation Plan for the ShakeAlert Produc-
tion System, including revised cost esti-
mates and timelines. Additionally, $5,000,000
is provided for necessary upgrades and re-
placement equipment at the USGS National
Earthquake Center and seismic stations that
make up the Advanced National Seismic
System (ANSS).
The agreement includes $800,000 for the
Central and Eastern U.S. Seismic Network
(CEUSN). The Committees continue
$1,000,000 for regional seismic networks and
expect the Survey to allocate funds accord-
ing to the same methodology used in fiscal
year 2017. The agreement includes $1,400,000
for the adoption of seismic stations cur-
rently deployed as part of the Earthscope
USArray project. The Committees direct the
Survey to consult with the National Science
Foundation (NSF) on acquiring these seismic
stations beginning in fiscal year 2019 and to
brief the Committees within 60 days of en-
actment of this Act on the progress of these
discussions and the plan to acquire the sta-
tions. The Committees understand the adop-
tion of the seismic and geodetic stations cur-
rently deployed as part of the USArray
project, along with the ANSS investments in
seismic monitoring, could contribute to a
monitoring network similar to the earth-
quake early warning system currently under
development for the west coast and encour-
age the Survey to consider this effort once
the west coast system is close to completion.
The agreement provides $42,621,000 for vol-
cano hazards, which includes $1,000,000 for
next-generation lahar detection systems and
$13,000,000 for the repair and upgrade of ana-
log systems on high-threat volcanos, includ-
ing $12,500,000 to update the instrumentation
that is currently not in compliance with the
National Telecommunication and Informa-
tion Administration (NTIA) radio spectrum
guidelines.
The agreement provides an additional
$1,500,000 for new lahar detection instrumen-
tation and telecommunications equipment
to address significant lahar threats and meet
National Volcano Early Warning System
(NVEWS) standards.
The Committees are concerned about the
potential landslide risk to communities and
direct the Survey to report back within 180
days of enactment of this Act identifying
specific areas of the country that are at the
highest risk.
Water Resources.—The agreement provides
$217,554,000 for Water Resources, with
$59,927,000 directed to activities associated
with the Cooperative Matching Funds. In-
creases include an additional $1,000,000 for
groundwater resource studies in the Mis-
sissippi River Alluvial Plain; $1,500,000 for
streamgages; and $300,000 to begin research
on shallow and fractured bedrock terrain.
The National Groundwater Monitoring
Network is funded at the fiscal year 2017 en-
acted level of $3,600,000. The agreement in-
cludes funding for the streamgage on trans-
boundary rivers at $120,000. The Committees
direct the Survey to partner with local
Tribes and other Federal agencies as nec-
essary in the area to develop a water quality
strategy for the transboundary rivers im-
pacted by mining activities. Within 180 days
of enactment of this Act, the Survey is di-
rected to report back to the Committees on
the necessary work needed to collect, ana-
lyze, and assess the hydrologic, water-qual-
ity, and ecological data needed to document
baseline conditions and assess potential min-
ing-related impacts.
Core Science Systems.—The agreement
provides $116,302,000, which includes
$23,000,000 for 3D Elevation Program (3DEP)
National Enhancement and $7,722,000 for
Alaska Mapping and Map Modernization.
Facilities.—The agreement includes
$120,091,000 for facilities, deferred mainte-
nance and capital improvement. Within
these amounts, $11,772,000 is included for the
Menlo Park facility transition. The Commit-
tees have almost doubled the funding for de-
ferred maintenance with the expectation the
Survey will be able to make much needed fa-
cility improvements. The Committees under-
stand that a report on the National Wildlife
Health Center’s infrastructure needs is near-
ing completion and expect the report to be
provided to the Committees within 60 days of
enactment of this Act.
BUREAU OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT
OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT
The bill provides $171,000,000 for Ocean En-
ergy Management to be partially offset with
the collection of rental receipts and cost re-
covery fees totaling $56,834,000, for a net dis-
cretionary appropriation of $114,166,000. The
bill does not include a rescission of funds to
cover the anticipated shortfall from the loss
of revenue, but the Committees are moni-
toring the continued decline in rental re-
ceipts. The Bureau is reminded to review the
directives contained in the front matter of
this explanatory statement. The agreement
includes the following additional guidance:
Five-year lease plan.—The request for the
Bureau’s efforts to initiate a new five year
offshore leasing program is fully funded and
the Committees encourage an expeditious
and thorough review.
Offshore Revenues.—The Committees do
not approve of the proposal in the budget re-
quest to divert outer continental shelf oil
and gas revenues from Gulf of Mexico coastal
communities. The Committees direct the De-
partment to distribute revenues from Gulf of
Mexico operations in a manner consistent
with the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act
of 2006 (P.L. 109–432).
Offshore Wind Energy Development.—The
Committees understand that the Bureau is
continuing to work in North Carolina with
local stakeholders, industry, and State task
forces and that there will be no lease sales
for offshore areas in North Carolina during
fiscal year 2018.
Renewable Energy.—The Bureau should
continue to follow the direction under this
heading in Senate Report 114–281 concerning
offshore wind energy and working coopera-
tively with the Department of Energy and
coastal States.
BUREAU OF SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL
ENFORCEMENT
OFFSHORE SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL
ENFORCEMENT
The bill provides $186,411,000 for Offshore
Safety and Environmental Enforcement to
be partially offset with the collection of
rental receipts, cost recovery fees and in-
spection fees totaling $77,871,000 for a net dis-
cretionary appropriation of $108,540,000. The
bill does not include a rescission of funds to
cover the anticipated shortfall from the loss
of revenue, but the Committees are moni-
toring the continued decline in rental re-
ceipts.
OIL SPILL RESEARCH
The bill provides $14,899,000 for Oil Spill
Research.
OFFICE OF SURFACE MINING RECLAMATION AND
ENFORCEMENT
REGULATION AND TECHNOLOGY
The bill provides $115,804,000 for the Office
of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforce-
ment (OSMRE) Regulation and Technology
account. Within this amount, the bill funds
regulatory grants at $68,590,000, equal to the
fiscal year 2017 enacted level.
Approximate Original Contours.—When ap-
propriate, the Committees encourage
OSMRE to discontinue cases related to Ap-
proximate Original Contour policies and reg-
ulations when OSMRE has lost the initial
administrative court case on the merits of
the case.
ABANDONED MINE RECLAMATION FUND
The bill provides $139,672,000 for the Aban-
doned Mine Reclamation Fund. Of the funds
provided, $24,672,000 shall be derived from the
Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund and
$115,000,000 shall be derived from the General
Fund.
The agreement provides $115,000,000 for
grants to States and Indian Tribes for the
reclamation of abandoned mine lands in con-
junction with economic and community de-
velopment and reuse goals. Consistent with
fiscal year 2017, $75,000,000 shall be distrib-
uted in equal amounts to the three Appa-
lachian States with the greatest amount of
unfunded needs and $30,000,000 shall be dis-
tributed in equal amounts to the three Appa-
lachian States with the subsequent greatest
amount of unfunded needs. Grants shall be
distributed to States with the same goals,
intent and direction as in fiscal year 2017.
The Committees believe that Tribes can
also contribute to the success of the pilot
and provide $10,000,000 for grants to federally
recognized Indian Tribes to be distributed for
the same goals, intent and purpose as the

grants to States. Eligible grant recipients
for the $10,000,000 are limited to Tribal gov-
ernmental entities who may subcontract
project-related activities as appropriate.
Coal Act.—The Committees believe
OSMRE should avoid taking any action that
would place in jeopardy the mandatory bene-
fits for eligible United Mine Workers of
America (UMWA) health beneficiaries, in-
cluding those who receive benefits because of
the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017
(P.L. 115–31), as well as mandatory funds pro-
vided to States and Indian Tribes. It has also
been brought to the attention of the Com-
mittees that certain businesses in rural
areas may face job losses because of affiliate
liability for healthcare that is unrelated to
the benefits enacted in the Consolidated Ap-
propriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115–31). Given the
disproportionate impact of job losses in rural
areas, the Committees are concerned about
those job losses. The Committees urge stake-
holders to find a solution that would both
avoid job losses in rural areas and is con-
sistent with other potential needs for the
mandatory funds overseen by OSMRE.
BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS AND BUREAU OF
INDIAN EDUCATION
OPERATION OF INDIAN PROGRAMS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The bill provides $2,411,200,000 for Oper-
ation of Indian Programs. The Bureaus are
expected to execute their budgets in accord-
ance with the justification submitted to the
Congress, except as otherwise directed below
or in the funding allocation table at the end
of this report. The table has been expanded
to include additional lines for the Bureau of
Indian Education and Public Safety and Jus-
tice. The Bureaus are reminded of the guid-
ance and reporting requirements contained
in House Report 115–238 that should be com-
plied with unless specifically addressed to
the contrary herein, as explained in the front
matter of this explanatory statement. The
Committees also expect the timely submis-
sion of reporting requirements as contained
in House Report 115–238 and as outlined in
this explanatory statement. The agreement
includes requested fixed costs and transfers
except where discussed below, and the fol-
lowing details and instructions.
The Committees are concerned about the
addition of several programs to the Govern-
ment Accountability Office’s 2017 high risk
list (GAO–17–317). The inclusion of these pro-
grams to this list indicate there are several
challenges to overcome in order to improve
the Federal management of programs that
serve Tribes and their members. The Com-
mittees stand ready to work with the Bu-
reaus to implement the necessary GAO rec-
ommendations.
Tribal Government.—The agreement pro-
vides $317,967,000 for Tribal government pro-
grams, of which $1,120,000 is for new Tribes
including those recognized during fiscal year
2018 beyond those contemplated in the budg-
et request. The Committees expect the Bu-
reau to efficiently administer the Tribal rec-
ognition process and strongly encourage ac-
tion on pending requests. The Small and
Needy Tribes program is funded at $4,448,000,
ensuring that all Tribes receive the max-
imum base level provided by the Bureau to
run Tribal governments.
Road maintenance is funded at $34,653,000
and includes $1,000,000 to improve the condi-
tion of unpaved roads and bridges used by
school buses transporting students, and
$1,000,000 for road maintenance in support of
implementing the NATIVE Act (P.L. 114–
221). The Bureau is directed to report back to
the Committees within 60 days of enactment
of this Act on how the Bureau plans to allo-
cate the funds provided in the bill and the
progress being made to implement the GAO
recommendations outlined in the report
GAO–17–423.
The Committees are aware that in some
areas along the border, including the areas of
the Tohono O’odham Nation in Arizona, and
the Blackfeet Nation in Montana, U.S. Cus-
toms and Border Protection (CBP) and
Tribes work together on border security. The
Committees have included bill language to
support the transfer of funds from CBP to
BIA, in consultation with affected Tribes, for
the reconstruction or repair of BIA owned
roads needed as a result of cooperative secu-
rity efforts on the U.S. border.
The Committees are concerned about the
Consolidated Tribal Government Program
internal transfer of $1,733,000 and have not
agreed to any changes from the fiscal year
2017 enacted level of $75,429,000 for this pro-
gram. The Bureau is directed to report back
to the Committees within 30 days of enact-
ment of this Act with a description of the
number of Tribes that use this program and
how increases for this program compare to
others that offer similar services.
Human Services.—The agreement provides
$161,063,000 for human services programs and
includes funding to continue the Tiwahe ini-
tiative at the fiscal year 2017 enacted level.
The Bureau is directed to report back to the
Committees within 90 days of enactment of
this Act on the performance measures being
used to monitor and track the Tiwahe initia-
tive’s effectiveness in Indian Country. The
Committees are aware of the pressing needs
women and children face in domestic vio-
lence situations; therefore, the Committees
expect at least $200,000 from human services
activities be used to support women and chil-
dren’s shelters that are serving the needs of
multiple Tribes or Alaska Native Villages in
the areas served by the Tiwahe pilot sites.
The Committees are concerned about the
funding distribution for welfare assistance
and direct the Bureau to report back to the
Committees within 30 days of enactment of
this Act on how this funding would be dis-
tributed.
Trust—Natural Resources Management.—
The agreement provides $204,202,000 for nat-
ural resources management programs and in-
cludes $390,000 to continue the Seminole and
Miccosukee water study as requested. The
agreement includes $355,000 in the Tribal
Management Development Program (TMDP)
for fisheries activities previously funded
within the Forestry program. Future funding
requests should reflect the transfer of this
activity to TMDP.
It is the Committees’ understanding that
the Bureau has entered into cooperative
agreements with the Ahtna Intertribal Re-
source Commission and the Kuskokwim
River Inter-Tribal Fisheries Commission,
and with other organizations interested in
establishing similar agreements; therefore,
it is the Committees’ expectation that with-
in the funding provided for the Tribal Man-
agement Development Program (TMDP),
pilot projects and programs for Alaska sub-
sistence will continue.
Consistent with treaty and trust obliga-
tions, the Committees direct the Bureau to
work with at-risk Tribes to identify and ex-
pedite the necessary resources to address the
resiliency needs of Tribal communities.
Within the amounts provided for Fish,
Wildlife, and Parks, the agreement continues
$545,000 for substantially producing Tribal
hatcheries in BIA’s Northwest Region cur-
rently not receiving annual BIA hatchery op-
erations funding. This funding should be al-
located in the same manner as in fiscal year
2017 but should be considered base funding in
fiscal year 2018 and thereafter.
The Department of the Interior is expected
to promote and expand the use of agreements
with Indian Tribes to protect Indian trust re-
sources from catastrophic wildfire, insect
and disease infestation, or other threats
from adjacent Federal lands, as authorized
by law. The Committees direct the Bureau to
coordinate with the Office of Wildland Fire
to submit a report describing how the De-
partment determines the use of wildfire sup-
pression and rehabilitation resources and
prioritizes Indian forest land, the title to
which is held by the United States in trust.
The Bureau is directed to enter into a for-
mal partnership with local Tribes and the
United States Geological Survey to help de-
velop a water quality strategy for trans-
boundary rivers.
The Committees expect that Tribes east of
the Mississippi River who have resource
challenges also receive appropriate funding.
Trust—Real Estate Services.—The agree-
ment provides $129,841,000 for real estate
services. All program elements within this
subactivity are continued at fiscal year 2017
enacted levels plus fixed costs and transfers,
except where discussed below.
The following line items each receive a
$500,000 program increase: land title and
records offices; land records improvement—
regional; and regional oversight. The Bureau
is expected to distribute the program in-
creases to regional offices to address admin-
istrative backlogs for Trust Real Estate
Services programs. As discussed in House Re-
port 115–238, the Committees expect an up-
date on the status of outstanding convey-
ances by September 2018, and an update on
what the Bureau will be changing in its oper-
ations policy to ensure backlogs and docu-
mentation-related rejections do not occur in
the future.
Alaska Native programs are funded at
$1,470,000 to support a program level of
$450,000 for the ANCSA Historical Places and
Cemetery Sites Program.
A program increase of $3,000,000 is included
for the plugging of abandoned wells not
under Bureau of Land Management author-
ity. The Committees direct the BIA to con-
duct an inventory of wells for which the BIA
is responsible to reclaim, including cost esti-
mates for submission to the Committees
within 180 days of enactment of this Act.
The Committees direct the Secretary, or
his designee, to work with the Lower Elwha
Klallam Tribe to identify appropriate lands
in Clallam County, Washington, to satisfy
the requirements of section 7 of the Elwha
River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration
Act (P.L. 102–495).
The Secretary, in consultation with other
interested agencies, is directed to provide a
report to Congress, on or before August 1,
2018, on the estimated cost of responses that
are necessary under applicable Federal and
State laws to protect human health and the
environment with respect to any hazardous
substance or hazardous waste remaining on
the property as authorized by section 13 of
Public Law 102–497.
Public Safety and Justice.—The agreement
provides $405,520,000 for public safety and jus-
tice programs. The detailed allocation table
at the end of this explanatory statement has
been expanded in order to more fully outline
program levels. Included within Criminal In-
vestigations and Police Services is $1,000,000
to implement the Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act and
$7,500,000 to help people affected by opioid
addiction. Within Detention/Corrections is a
$1,400,000 increase for recently constructed
facilities that do not currently have existing
program funding within the BIA budget; ad-
ditional funding in future years will be con-
sidered as information becomes available.
Within Law Enforcement Special Initiatives
is $3,033,000 to reduce recidivism through the
Tiwahe initiative. Within Tribal Justice
Support is $2,000,000 to implement the Vio-
lence Against Women Act for both training

and specific Tribal court needs, and
$13,000,000 to address the needs of Tribes af-
fected by Public Law 83–280. Within Law En-
forcement Program Management is a $500,000
increase for the Office of Justice Services’
District III Office to promote timely pay-
ments.
The Committees remain concerned about
Tribal courts’ needs as identified in the In-
dian Law and Order Commission’s November
2013 report, which notes that Federal invest-
ment in Tribal justice in ‘‘P.L. 280’’ States
has been more limited than elsewhere in In-
dian Country. The Committees expect the
Bureau to continue to work with Tribes and
Tribal organizations in these States to con-
sider options that promote, design, or pilot
Tribal court systems for Tribal communities
subject to full or partial State jurisdiction
under Public Law 83–280.
The Committees understand that several
Tribes whose Federal recognition was termi-
nated and then subsequently restored now
face significant challenges in securing law
enforcement funding through self-determina-
tion contracts. The Bureau is directed to
work with affected Tribes to assess their law
enforcement needs and submit a report with-
in 120 days of enactment of this Act that de-
tails the amounts necessary to provide suffi-
cient law enforcement capacity for them.
Community and Economic Development.—
The agreement provides $46,447,000 for com-
munity and economic development pro-
grams, of which: $12,549,000 is for job place-
ment and training and includes $1,550,000 for
the Tiwahe initiative; $1,826,000 is for eco-
nomic development; $26,416,000 is for min-
erals and mining and includes $1,000,000 for
the modernization of oil and gas records in-
cluding the National Indian Oil and Gas
Management System (NIOGEMS); and
$5,656,000 is for community development cen-
tral oversight, of which $3,400,000 is to imple-
ment the Native American Tourism and Im-
proving Visitor Experience Act, including
via cooperative agreements with Tribes or
Tribal organizations. The Committees under-
stand that the NIOGEMS has been distrib-
uted to some Tribes and regional offices; the
Bureau is instructed to report back within
120 days of enactment of this Act on the cost
to further expand this system to more res-
ervations and offices.
The recent high risk GAO report (GAO–17–
317) found the Bureau does not properly man-
age Indian energy resources. The Commit-
tees request the Bureau to report back with-
in 180 days of enactment of this Act out-
lining any barriers, statutory or regulatory,
that impede development of these resources.
Executive Direction and Administrative
Services.—The agreement provides
$231,747,000 for executive direction and ad-
ministrative services. All budget line items
are funded at fiscal year 2017 enacted levels
and adjusted for fixed costs and transfers, ex-
cept for human capital management and
intra-governmental payments, which are
funded at the requested levels.
Within 60 days on enactment of this Act,
the Bureau is directed to make funds pro-
vided within executive direction available to
solicit proposals from independent non-profit
or academic entities to prepare a report on
the likely impacts of the closure of the Nav-
ajo Generating Station power plant on af-
fected Tribes, State and local governments
and other stakeholders within the Four Cor-
ners region. In consultation with impacted
Tribes, an entity shall be selected to prepare
a report within 12 months of the award that
(1) details potential economic impacts re-
lated to the plant’s closure; and (2) identifies
specific policy recommendations that would
mitigate the potential economic and societal
consequences of the plant’s closure on af-
fected Tribes or other stakeholders.
The Committees note that the Bureau has
not yet complied with the fiscal year 2017 di-
rective to provide a report on funding re-
quirements associated with operating and
law enforcement needs for congressionally
authorized treaty fishing sites on the Colum-
bia River. The Bureau is directed to transmit
the report no later than 30 days following en-
actment of this Act. The Bureau is also
urged to incorporate unfunded needs for
these sites as part of future budget requests.
Indian Affairs is directed to complete an-
nual health and safety inspections and back-
ground checks at all BIE system facilities,
and to submit quarterly updates on the sta-
tus of such efforts to the Committees.
Bureau of Indian Education.—The agree-
ment includes $914,413,000 for the Bureau of
Indian Education, the details of which are
included in the expanded allocation table at
the end of this explanatory statement. Trib-
al grant support costs continue to be fully
funded. Additional details follow:
A one-time increase is provided to com-
plete the transition to a school year funding
cycle for all Tribal colleges and universities,
including Haskell Indian Nations University
and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Insti-
tute. The Committees recognize that many
Tribal colleges have significant unfunded
needs, and direct the Bureau to work with
Tribal leaders and other stakeholders to de-
velop a consistent methodology for deter-
mining Tribal college operating needs to in-
form future budget requests. The Commit-
tees expect the methodology to address oper-
ating and infrastructure needs including
classrooms and housing.
The agreement includes $18,810,000 for
early child and family development, which
should be used to expand the Family and
Child Education (FACE) program. The agree-
ment rescinds $8,000,000 from expiring prior
year balances that the Bureau failed to obli-
gate. This rescission does not impact the
program’s operating level for fiscal year 2018.
The Committees support efforts to revi-
talize and maintain Native languages and ex-
pand the use of language immersion pro-
grams. The ISEP program is expected to con-
tinue to enhance access to Native language
and culture programs in Bureau-funded
schools, and the Bureau shall report back
within 60 days of enactment of this Act on
how funding has been and can continue to be
used to support these programs. In addition,
$2,000,000 is provided within Education Pro-
gram Enhancements for capacity building
grants for Bureau and tribally operated
schools to expand existing language immer-
sion programs or to create new programs.
Prior to distributing these funds, the Bureau
shall coordinate with the Department of
Education and Department of Health and
Human Services to ensure that Bureau in-
vestments complement, but do not duplicate,
existing language immersion programs. The
Committees also direct the Bureau to submit
a report to the Committees within 120 days
of enactment of this Act regarding the sta-
tus of fiscal year 2017 funds and the planned
distribution of funds in this Act.
The Johnson O’Malley program is funded
at $14,903,000. The Committees remain con-
cerned that the distribution of funds is not
an accurate reflection of the distribution of
students. The Bureau is directed to report
back to the Committees within 90 days of en-
actment of this Act on the status of updating
the student counts.
The Committees remain concerned about
recent Government Accountability Office
(GAO) reports detailing problems within the
K–12 Indian education system at the Depart-
ment of the Interior, in particular as they
pertain to organizational structure, account-
ability, finance, health and safety, and ulti-
mately student performance. As the Depart-
ment takes steps to reform the system, the
Secretary is reminded that future support
from Congress will continue to be based in
large part upon successful implementation of
GAO report recommendations. In particular,
consistent with GAO report 13–774, the Sec-
retary is urged to reorganize Indian Affairs
so that control and accountability of the BIE
system is consolidated within the BIE, to
present such reorganization proposal in the
next fiscal year budget request, and to sub-
mit to the Committees a corresponding up-
dated workforce plan. Consistent with GAO
testimonies 15–389T, 15–539T, 15–597T, and
any subsequent reports, the Secretary is
urged to personally oversee immediate ac-
tions necessary to ensure the continued
health and safety of students and employees
at BIE schools and facilities. The Office of
the Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs is di-
rected to report back within 60 days of en-
actment of this Act on the progress made to-
wards implementing all the GAO rec-
ommendations and the current status of the
reform effort.
The Committees understand the impor-
tance of bringing broadband to reservations
and villages, but remain concerned about the
planning process used for this type of invest-
ment. The Committees direct the agency to
report back within 90 days of enactment of
this Act on a scalable plan to increase band-
width in schools, procure computers and
software, and to include in this report how
the Bureau is working with other Federal
agencies to coordinate and plan for the tech-
nology buildout.
The BIE is encouraged to coordinate with
the Indian Health Service to integrate pre-
ventive dental care and mental health care
at schools within the BIE system.
The bill includes modified language lim-
iting the expansion of grades and schools in
the BIE system which allows for the expan-
sion of additional grades to schools that
meet certain criteria.
The Committees continue to encourage ef-
forts to improve interagency coordination
for the wide range of programs that affect
the wellbeing of Native children and expect
the Bureau to work with relevant Federal,
State, local and Tribal organizations to
make these programs more effective.
The Committees are concerned by the re-
cent Government Accountability Office re-
port (GAO–17–423) on Tribal transportation,
which identified potential negative impacts
of road conditions on Native student school
attendance. The Committees recommend
BIE take steps to improve its data collection
on the cause of student absences, including
data on road and weather conditions, and to
report back to the Committees within 120
days of enactment of this Act regarding its
actions to improve student absence data
tracking and analysis.
CONTRACT SUPPORT COSTS
The bill provides an indefinite appropria-
tion for contract support costs, consistent
with fiscal year 2017 and estimated to be
$241,600,000.
CONSTRUCTION
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The bill provides $354,113,000 for Construc-
tion. Details are contained in the justifica-
tion submitted to the Congress and in the
funding allocation table at the end of this
explanatory statement, except as otherwise
discussed below:
Account-wide.—Not later than 90 days
after enactment of this Act, Indian Affairs
shall submit an operating plan to the Com-
mittees detailing how fiscal year 2018 fund-
ing will be allocated and including specific
projects where available and the method-
ology used in the prioritization. Where spe-
cific project allocations are not yet avail-
able, the plan shall provide the cir-
cumstances and Indian Affairs shall brief the

Committees when project allocations are
available.
Joint Ventures.—Indian Affairs is expected
to comply with the directive in House Report
115–238 regarding the establishment of joint
venture programs for schools and justice
centers and modeled after the Indian Health
Service’s program.
Education Construction.—The agreement
provides $238,245,000 for schools and related
facilities within the Bureau of Indian Edu-
cation system and includes the following:
$105,504,000 for replacement school campus
construction; $23,935,000 for replacement fa-
cility construction; $13,574,000 for employee
housing repair; and $95,232,000 for facilities
improvement and repair. The Committees
expect the increase provided for facilities
improvement and repair to be used to ad-
dress deficiencies identified by annual school
safety inspections.
The Committees continue to expect BIA
and BIE to work together to ensure that an-
nual safety inspections are completed for all
BIE schools and remain concerned that the
Bureaus have not developed concrete track-
ing and capacity-building systems to ensure
that safety issues flagged by these inspec-
tions are addressed in a timely manner. The
Committees are also concerned by reports
from tribally operated schools that BIE is
not providing necessary training or access to
funding from the Facilities Improvement
and Repair program to meet urgent safety
and maintenance needs. The Committees di-
rect BIE and BIA to provide an implementa-
tion plan to the Committees to address these
concerns within 120 days of enactment of
this Act.
The Bureau of Indian Education is directed
to report back within 60 days of enactment
of this Act on the progress the Bureau has
made towards implementing a long-term fa-
cilities needs assessment modeled after the
Department of Defense Education Activity,
as directed by House Report 114–632.
The Committees continue to strongly sup-
port innovative financing options to supple-
ment annual appropriations and accelerate
repair and replacement of Bureau schools,
including through the use of construction
bonds, tax credits, and grant programs.
Public Safety and Justice Construction.—
The agreement provides $35,309,000 for public
safety and justice construction and includes
the following: $18,000,000 to restart the facili-
ties replacement and new construction pro-
gram; $4,494,000 for employee housing;
$9,372,000 for facilities improvement and re-
pair; $169,000 for fire safety coordination; and
$3,274,000 for fire protection.
The Committees include funding for the re-
placement construction program, which has
not received funding from the Bureau since
fiscal year 2010, as other agencies have
sought to build these facilities. The Commit-
tees also understand the Bureau currently
has compiled a list of replacement facilities
based upon the facilities condition index, in-
mate populations, and available space. It is
the expectation the funding made available
for this activity will utilize this list. Fur-
ther, the Committees encourage the Bureau
to develop a master plan that details the lo-
cation and condition of existing facilities
relative to the user population, and incor-
porates the use of existing tribally con-
structed facilities and regional justice cen-
ters, such as the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes’
Justice Center, as an efficient approach to
filling gaps where additional facilities are
needed. Reasonable driving distances for vis-
itation should be taken into consideration.
Resources Management Construction.—
The agreement provides $67,192,000 for re-
sources management construction programs
and includes the following: $24,692,000 for ir-
rigation project construction; $2,596,000 for
engineering and supervision; $1,016,000 for
survey and design; $648,000 for Federal power
compliance; and $38,240,000 for dam safety
and maintenance.
The Committees are aware of the aging In-
dian irrigation systems and that most of
these systems are in need of major capital
improvement; therefore, additional funding
has been included to address the infrastruc-
ture needs. Additionally, it is the Commit-
tees’ understanding that these projects are
consistent with those activities authorized
as part of the Water Infrastructure Improve-
ments for the Nation Act (P.L. 114–322).
The Committees are concerned that there
are an unknown number of dams on reserva-
tions that have not received a hazard classi-
fication, and that the current review process
is behind schedule. The Committees strongly
encourage the Bureau to begin the work on
these dams and report back to the Commit-
tees on the best way to effectively quantify
the potential pool of dams on reservations in
need of a review and/or classification.
Other Program Construction.—The agree-
ment provides $13,367,000 for other programs
and includes the following: $1,119,000 for tele-
communications; $3,919,000 for facilities and
quarters; and $8,329,000 for program manage-
ment, including $2,400,000 to continue the
project at Fort Peck.
INDIAN LAND AND WATER CLAIMS SETTLEMENTS

encourage the Secretary to coordinate with
the Department of Agriculture, other Fed-
eral agencies, States, Tribes, private enti-
ties, and communities to establish a scientif-
ically based and watershed-focused pilot pro-
gram to eradicate tamarisk in the south-
western United States.
Departmental Documents.—The Commit-
tees remind the Department of the need in
departmental documents that delineate Fed-
eral, State, and private land, such as acquisi-
tion boundary maps and resource manage-
ment plans, to more clearly indicate that
Federal land management documents apply
only to Federal lands and do not apply to
private land unless authorized by law and ap-
proved by the landowner.
Tribal Energy Development.—The Com-
mittees direct the Secretary to provide a re-
port to the Committees within 90 days of en-
actment of this Act on efforts to improve the
ability of Tribes to develop energy resources
on tribal lands. Such report should address
any potential obstacles, including statutory
or regulatory, to full resource utilization.
Conservation Partnerships.—The Commit-
tees continue to support the partnership be-
tween the Department and the 21st Century

TITLE II—ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION AGENCY
The bill provides $8,058,488,000 for the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency (EPA). The
bill does not support reductions proposed in
the budget request unless explicitly noted in
the explanatory statement.
Congressional Budget Justification.—The
Agency is directed to continue to include the
information requested in House Report 112–
331 and any proposals to change State alloca-
tion formulas that affect the distribution of
appropriated funds in future budget jus-
tifications.
Reprogramming and Workforce Reshap-
ing.—The agreement does not include any of
the requested funds for workforce reshaping.
Further, the Committees do not expect the
Agency to consolidate or close any regional
offices in fiscal year 2018. The Agency is held
to the reprogramming limitation of $1,000,000
and should continue to follow the reprogram-
ming directives as provided in the front of
this explanatory statement. It is noted that
such reprogramming directives apply to pro-
posed reorganizations, workforce restruc-
ture, reshaping, transfer of functions, or
downsizing, especially those of significant
national or regional importance, and include
closures, consolidations, and relocations of
offices, facilities, and laboratories.
Further, the Agency may not use any
amount of deobligated funds to initiate a
new program, office, or initiative, without
the prior approval of the Committees. Within
30 days of enactment of this Act, the Agency
is directed to submit to the House and Sen-
ate Committees on Appropriations its annual
operating plan for fiscal year 2018, which
shall detail how the Agency plans to allocate
funds at the program project level.
Other.—It is noted that the current work-
force is below the fiscal year 2017 level,
therefore, the agreement includes rescissions
in the Science and Technology and Environ-
mental Programs and Management accounts
that capture expected savings associated
with such changes. The Agency is directed to
first apply the rescissions across program
project areas to reflect routine attrition that
will occur in those program project areas in
fiscal year 2018 and then to reflect efficiency
savings in a manner that seeks, to the extent
practicable, to be proportional among pro-
gram project areas. Amounts provided in
this Act are sufficient to fully fund Agency
payroll estimates. The Committees under-
stand that the Agency routinely makes fund-
ing payroll requirements a top priority, and
the Committees expect the Agency will con-
tinue to do so as it executes its fiscal year
2018 appropriation and applies the rescis-
sions.
The Committees do not expect the Agency
will undertake adverse personnel actions or
incentive programs to comply with the re-
scissions nor do the Committees expect the
Agency will undertake large-scale adverse
personnel actions or incentive programs in
fiscal year 2018. As specified in the bill lan-
guage, the rescissions shall not apply to the
Geographic Programs, the National Estuary
Program, and the National Priorities fund-
ing in the Science and Technology and Envi-
ronmental Programs and Management ac-
counts. The Agency is directed to submit, as
part of the operating plan, detail on the ap-
plication of such rescissions at the program
project level.
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
(INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)
For Science and Technology programs, the
bill provides $713,823,000 to be partially offset
by a $7,350,000 rescission for a net discre-
tionary appropriation of $706,473,000. The bill
transfers $15,496,000 from the Hazardous Sub-
stance Superfund account to this account.
The bill provides the following specific fund-
ing levels and direction:
Indoor Air and Radiation.—The bill pro-
vides $5,997,000 and funding for the radon pro-
gram is maintained at not less than the fis-
cal year 2017 enacted level.
Research: National Priorities.—The bill
provides $4,100,000 which shall be used for ex-
tramural research grants, independent of the
Science to Achieve Results (STAR) grant
program, to fund high-priority water quality
and availability research by not-for-profit
organizations who often partner with the
Agency. Because these grants are inde-
pendent of the STAR grant program, the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2622 March 22, 2018
Agency should strive to award grants in as
large an amount as is possible to achieve the
most scientifically significant research.
Funds shall be awarded competitively with
priority given to partners proposing research
of national scope and who provide a 25 per-
cent match. The Agency is directed to allo-
cate funds to grantees within 180 days of en-
actment of this Act.
Additional Guidance.—The agreement in-
cludes the following additional guidance:
Alternatives Testing.—The Agency is di-
rected to follow the guidance contained
under this heading in House Report 115–238
and to also include in its report to the Com-
mittees information and analysis related to
potential barriers or limitations on the use
of alternative test methods and to ensure
that any future plans address such barriers
or limitations, particularly as they relate to
susceptible populations.
Computational Toxicology.—The Commit-
tees support the Agency’s computational
toxicology research activities to advance the
next generation of risk assessment methods,
including for prioritization, screening and
testing under the Lautenberg Chemical Safe-
ty Act (LCSA). Such research activities
must be carried out following the require-
ments of the LCSA to ensure that alter-
native test methods ‘‘provide information of
equivalent or better scientific quality and
relevance’’ and to protect susceptible sub-
populations from unreasonable risk. The
Agency’s National Center for Computational
Toxicology (NCCT) is encouraged to expand
its collaborations with scientific experts
outside of the Agency to advance develop-
ment and use of human biology-based experi-
mental and computational approaches for
chemical assessments.
The Committees direct the Agency to de-
velop the strategic plan on alternative meth-
ods and testing strategies required by the
LCSA utilizing the leadership of the Director
of Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics
(OPPT), the Director of NCCT, the Director
of the National Toxicology Program (NTP),
and the Director of the National Center for
Environmental Assessment (NCEA). The
process for developing this strategic plan
shall include requests for information from
the scientific community and the public and
two or more public meetings or workshops.
The Agency shall circulate the draft stra-
tegic plan for public review and comment,
revise the plan to address comments and
then issue the strategic plan, which shall in-
clude an appendix documenting response to,
and disposition of, public comments. In addi-
tion, NCCT, OPPT, NTP, and NCEA shall
each assign 1 FTE to collaborate on evalu-
ating computational toxicology, in vitro
methods and alternative test methods for
specific scientifically-valid applications by
OPPT for implementation in the LCSA. The
Committees request the Agency to provide a
status report on these activities no later
than September 30, 2018.
Enhanced Aquifer Use.—The Agency is di-
rected to continue following the guidance
contained in Senate Report 114–281 in addi-
tion to the guidance contained in House Re-
port 115–238 directing the Agency to coordi-
nate with other Federal research efforts in
this area.
Integrated Risk Information System.—The
agreement continues to provide funding for
the Integrated Risk Information System
(IRIS) program at the fiscal year 2017 en-
acted level and direction that the program
continues within the Office of Research and
Development. The Committees remain con-
cerned that the program has appeared on the
Government Accountability Office’s (GAO)
High Risk List since 2008. The Committees
are aware of progress made by the Agency to
implement the 2011 National Academy of
Sciences’ (NAS) Chapter 7 and 2014 NAS re-
port recommendations for the IRIS program,
but remain concerned that the recommenda-
tions have not been fully implemented. The
Committees note that the Agency and the
NAS held a workshop in February 2018 to re-
view advances made to the IRIS process, and
that an NAS report on IRIS’ progress is
forthcoming. The Committees are encour-
aged that the program indicated its willing-
ness to more closely align the development
of risk assessments with stated regulatory
priorities of the Agency, and believes that
these efforts will make the assessments more
relevant. The Committees understand that
the program intends to continue the develop-
ment of new methodologies and technologies
to enhance the development of future IRIS
assessments and encourages the program to
do so, while also encouraging the program to
ensure that all IRIS methodologies attain
the highest scientific rigor. Finally, the
Committees urge the expedited completion
of the IRIS handbook and direct that the
public be afforded an opportunity to provide
comment on the handbook before it is placed
in use.
National Air Toxics Trends Station Net-
work.—The agreement maintains funding for
the National Air Toxic Trends Station Net-
work, which tracks air pollution trends at 27
stations across the country, at the fiscal
year 2017 enacted level to accommodate the
network’s ongoing activities to gather con-
sistent, high-quality monitoring data on haz-
ardous air pollutants across the country.
Nanomaterials Research.—The Agency
should continue to follow the direction in-
cluded in Senate Report 114–281 and seek to
maximize collaborative research efforts with
the Food and Drug Administration.
Partnership Research.—The Committees
encourage the Agency to continue leveraged
partnerships with not-for-profit institutions
that often partner with the Agency, indus-
try, and affected stakeholders to produce
independent science and evaluate the effec-
tiveness of environmental regulations relat-
ing to unconventional oil and gas develop-
ment. The study should be used to provide
credible science, of national scope, relating
to unconventional oil and gas development.
Within available funds, the Agency is di-
rected to use not less than $1,000,000 to part-
ner on such a study during fiscal year 2018.
STAR Grants.—The agreement provides
funds to continue the Science to Achieve Re-
sults (STAR) program and the Committees
direct the Agency to distribute grants con-
sistent with fiscal year 2017. Within 90 days
of enactment of this Act, the Committees di-
rect the Agency to provide a briefing on its
plans for the program in fiscal year 2018.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS AND MANAGEMENT
(INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)
For Environmental Programs and Manage-
ment, the bill provides $2,643,299,000 to be
partially offset by a $45,300,000 rescission for
a net discretionary appropriation of
$2,597,999,000. The bill provides the following
specific funding levels and direction:
Clean Air.—The agreement maintains
funding for the EnergySTAR program at the
fiscal year 2017 enacted level. In 2009, the
Agency and the Department of Energy (DOE)
signed a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) related to the EnergySTAR Program,
which shifted some functions related to
home appliance products from the DOE to
EPA. The Agency shall work with the DOE
to review the 2009 MOU and report to the
Committees within 90 days of enactment of
this Act on whether the expected efficiencies
for home appliance products have been
achieved.
Further, the Committees do not support
the proposed termination of voluntary pro-
grams, including Natural GasSTAR,
AgSTAR, the Combined Heat and Power
Partnership, and other partnership programs
where EPA works collaboratively with non-
governmental entities to identify beneficial
methods to reduce emissions, reduce pollu-
tion, or increase efficiency. The Committees
also maintain both program areas related to
stratospheric ozone at not less than the fis-
cal year 2017 enacted level.
Environmental Protection: National Prior-
ities.—The bill provides $12,700,000 for a com-
petitive grant program to provide technical
assistance for improved water quality or safe
drinking water, adequate waste water to
small systems or individual private well
owners. The Agency shall provide $10,000,000
for the Grassroots Rural and Small Commu-
nity Water Systems Assistance Act, for ac-
tivities specified under section 1442(e) of the
Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300j-
1(e)(8)). The Agency is also directed to pro-
vide $1,700,000 for grants to qualified not-for-
profit organizations for technical assistance
for individual private well owners, with pri-
ority given to organizations that currently
provide technical and educational assistance
to individual private well owners. The Agen-
cy is directed to provide on a national and
multi-State regional basis, $1,000,000 for
grants to qualified organizations, for the sole
purpose of providing onsite training and
technical assistance for wastewater systems.
The Agency shall require each grantee to
provide a minimum 10 percent match, in-
cluding in kind contributions. The Agency is
directed to allocate funds to grantees within
180 days of enactment of this Act.
The Committees understand the Agency
has made a decision to put out a multi-year
Request for Applications for fiscal year 2017
and fiscal year 2018 without expressed ap-
proval from the Committees. The Commit-
tees expect the Agency to formally consult
on similar decisions in the future.
Geographic Programs.—The bill provides
$447,857,000, as distributed in the table at the
end of this division, and includes the fol-
lowing direction:
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.—The
bill provides $300,000,000 and the Agency shall
continue to follow the direction as provided
in House Report 112–589 and in Senate Report
114–281 related to the Great Lakes Restora-
tion Initiative. Additionally, the Commit-
tees encourage Agency funds for Great Lakes
projects to be made available for projects in
the historic Great Lakes Basin, which in-
cludes the Chicago River Watershed.
Chesapeake Bay.—The bill provides
$73,000,000 and the Agency shall allocate
funds consistent with the direction under
this heading in Senate Report 114–281.
Gulf of Mexico.—The bill provides
$12,542,000 for the Gulf of Mexico Geographic
Program where hypoxia is a growing cause
for concern. The Committees direct the
Agency to coordinate with the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture, the Gulf States, and
other State, local and private partners to le-
verage greater resources toward conserva-
tion projects on working-lands within the
Gulf Region and Mississippi River Basin. The
Agency is directed to distribute funds in the
same manner as fiscal year 2017.
Lake Champlain.—The bill provides
$8,399,000 for the Lake Champlain program.
From within the amount provided, $4,399,000
shall be allocated in the same manner as fis-
cal year 2017 and $4,000,000 shall be for other-
wise unmet needs necessary to implement
the Agency’s 2016 Phosphorus Total Max-
imum Daily Load Plan for Lake Champlain
for projects and work identified in the State
implementation plan.
Puget Sound.—The bill provides $28,000,000
and the Agency shall follow the direction
under this heading in House Report 115–238.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2623
March 22, 2018
Northwest Forest Program.—The North-
west Forest Program is funded at not less
than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level.
South Florida Program.—The agreement
maintains funding for the South Florida Pro-
gram and directs the Agency to allocate
funds in the same manner as fiscal year 2017.
Indoor Air and Radiation.—The agreement
maintains funding for the radon program at
the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and funds
have been included for Radiation Protection
and Reduce Risks from Indoor Air programs.
Information Exchange/Outreach.—The
agreement includes funding for tribal capac-
ity building equal to the fiscal year 2017 en-
acted level, and the Agency is directed to use
environmental education funds for the smart
skin care program, similar to prior years.
The agreement also provides for the Small
Minority Business Assistance program to be
continued.
International Programs.—The bill provides
$15,400,000 and includes funds to maintain the
U.S.-Mexico Border program at the fiscal
year 2017 enacted level.
Legal/Science/Regulatory/Economic Re-
view.—The bill provides $111,414,000, equal to
the fiscal year 2017 enacted level. Within
that amount, Integrated Environmental
Strategies is funded at the fiscal year 2017
level, so that the Agency can continue to
provide locally-led, community-driven tech-
nical assistance to communities in partner-
ship with localities, States, and other Fed-
eral agencies.
Official Reception and Representation Ex-
penses.—The bill provides necessary funding
for the Agency’s Commission on Environ-
mental Cooperation meeting in fiscal year
2018.
Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act.—The bill provides $109,377,000. Of the
funds provided under this section, $6,000,0000
should be allocated for the purpose of devel-
oping and implementing a Federal permit
program for the regulation of coal combus-
tion residuals in nonparticipating States, as
authorized under section 4005(d)(2)(B) of the
Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C.
6945(d)(2)(B)). The Committees also reiterate
the importance of additional language in-
cluded in House Report 115–238 related to
coal combustion residuals and recognize that
additional State grants may be necessary as
States work to implement permit programs
as authorized under section 2301 of the WIIN
Act (Public Law 114–322).
Additionally, the Committees continue to
support the Waste Minimization and Recy-
cling program, and the Agency is encouraged
to use funds from within the program to help
public entities demonstrate community an-
aerobic digester applications to municipal
solid waste streams and farm needs such as
capturing excess phosphorus.
Toxics Risk Review and Prevention.—The
bill provides $92,521,000 and maintains fund-
ing for the Pollution Prevention program
and the Lead Risk Reduction program.
Water: Ecosystems.—The bill provides
$47,788,000. From within the amount pro-
vided, $26,723,000 has been provided for the
National Estuary Program (NEP) grants as
authorized by section 320 of the Clean Water
Act. This amount is sufficient to provide
each of the 28 national estuaries in the pro-
gram with a grant of at least $600,000.
Further, in the Administrative Provisions
section, the Committees direct that $1,000,000
in competitive grants be made available for
additional projects, and encourages the
Agency to work in consultation with the
NEP directors to identify worthy projects
and activities.
Water Quality Protection. —The bill pro-
vides $210,417,000 and maintains funding for
the WaterSENSE program at the fiscal year
2017 enacted level.
Additional Guidance.—The agreement in-
cludes the following additional guidance:
Chesapeake Bay.—The Committees note
the agreements signed by the Agency, States
and other stakeholders to locate a Chesa-
peake Bay Liaison Office in Annapolis,
Maryland to facilitate coordination among
jurisdictions and from participating Federal
agencies in support of the Chesapeake Bay
Program. Currently, the Chesapeake Bay
Program Office is located in Annapolis, per
the agreement, and houses staff from the
Chesapeake Bay Program, five Federal agen-
cies and 35 non-Federal partners in order to
facilitate program coordination. The Com-
mittees note and appreciate the commit-
ment made by the Agency to locate the of-
fice in, or immediately adjacent to, Annap-
olis, in compliance with the signed agree-
ments and to also ensure that the future of-
fice space will continue to accommodate all
of the current Chesapeake Bay Program Of-
fice participants. The Committees direct the
Agency to completely fulfill those commit-
ments and to keep the Committees fully ap-
prised of progress in each step of the lease
process.
Coal Refuse-Fired Electrical Generating
Units.—In its rulemaking on New Source
Performance Standards (NSPS), the Agency
provided a separate subcategory for SO2
emissions standards for owners and opera-
tors of affected coal refuse-fired facilities
combusting 75 percent or more coal refuse on
an annual basis. In the subsequent rule-
making, ‘‘National Emission Standards for
Hazardous Air Pollutants from Coal- and Oil-
Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating
Units,’’ (the MATS rule) the Agency did not
provide a separate subcategory for coal
refuse-fired Electric Generating Units
(EGUs). It is noted that some stakeholders
believe that the NSPS standard appro-
priately recognizes the multimedia environ-
mental benefits provided by coal refuse-fired
EGUs and that the high sulfur content
present in coal refuse presents economic and
technical difficulties in achieving the same
acid gas standards as for coal. The Agency
should consider revising the MATS Rule as
soon as practicable to provide a separate cat-
egory for coal refuse-fired EGUs for purposes
of the acid gas requirement and its SO2 sur-
rogate consistent with the NSPS.
Diesel Generators in Remote Alaska Vil-
lages.—Under 40 CFR 60.4216, diesel genera-
tors purchased after Model Year 2014 are re-
quired to have a diesel particulate filter if
they are used as the primary power gener-
ator. The Committees understand that these
filters have a high failure rate in harsh
weather conditions and that repair of the fil-
ters can be difficult and expensive. The Com-
mittees direct the Agency to reexamine 40
CFR 60.4216 and consider exempting these
Villages from the diesel particulate filter re-
quirement.
Ecolabels for Federal Procurement.—Mul-
tiple forest certification systems have been
recognized throughout the Federal govern-
ment as supporting the use of sustainable
products in building construction and other
uses. The Committees are concerned that the
Agency’s efforts have not acknowledged
many of these certification systems and are
therefore limiting the procurement of some
products that may be sustainable. The Com-
mittees understand that the Agency’s Wood/
Lumber product category recommendation is
currently under review. The Committees di-
rect the Agency to align its Wood/Lumber
recommendation with the provisions of the
USDA BioPreferred program.
Elk River.—The Committees encourage the
Agency, in coordination with the Depart-
ment of State and other Federal agencies, to
work with State, local, and Tribal partners
on efforts to reduce selenium, sulfates, ni-
trates and other harmful contaminants in
the Kootenai Watershed, to which the Elk
River is a tributary. The Agency is directed
to brief the Committees on its efforts within
180 days of enactment of this Act.
Exempt Aquifers.—The Agency shall follow
the guidance contained under this heading in
House Report 115–238.
Fish Grinding.—Under a Clean Water Act
general permit, onshore seafood processors
in Alaska are allowed to grind and discharge
seafood waste. The permit requires that all
seafood waste be ground to a size of no more
than one-half inch in any dimension. Unfor-
tunately, in some instances, the best avail-
able technology is unable to achieve a half
inch grind dimension on a consistent basis
due to the malleable nature of fish waste.
The Agency should develop a policy to en-
sure that fish processors using the best
available technology and/or best conven-
tional practice will be considered in compli-
ance. Additionally, processing vessels oper-
ating in waters off-shore of Alaska are sub-
ject to the same one-half inch grinding re-
quirement even though there are no docu-
mented water quality issues that require
such grinding. The Agency should exempt
offshore processing vessels from the require-
ment.
Glider Kits.—The Committees understand
the Agency has announced plans to revisit
portions of its Phase 2 Greenhouse Gas
(GHG) Emissions and Fuel Efficiency Stand-
ards for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines.
Upon completion of the review, the Agency
is directed to update the Committees on the
matter.
Integrated Planning.—The Agency is en-
couraged to continue using an integrated
planning approach to enhance flexibility for
communities struggling to meet compliance
costs mandated under the Clean Water Act
(CWA) as well as the Agency’s efforts to con-
sider a community’s ability to pay for com-
pliance costs when determining permitting
actions under the CWA. The Agency is di-
rected to maintain technical assistance and
outreach to communities seeking to develop
and implement an integrated planning ap-
proach to meeting Clean Water Act require-
ments. Further, the Committees urge the
Agency to implement integrated planning
measures through a flexible permit process
rather than enforcement actions and consent
decrees.
Interagency Consultations.—The Agency is
directed to continue following the require-
ments in Senate Report 114–281 regarding
consultation with the Secretary of Agri-
culture related to the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.
Pesticides Registration Improvement
Act.—The agreement provides additional
funding for compliance with the Pesticides
Registration Improvement Act. The Com-
mittees direct the Agency to comply with
the fiscal year 2017 quarterly reporting re-
quirement related to previously collected
maintenance fees that are currently unavail-
able for obligation. To ensure the Commit-
tees have the most accurate information re-
garding this issue, the Agency is directed to
provide a briefing within 30 days of enact-
ment of this Act.
Public Access to Research.—The Agency
released its Plan to Increase Access to Re-
sults of EPA–Funded Scientific Research on
November 29, 2016. The Committees urge the
Agency to continue its efforts towards full
implementation of the plan, and directs the
Agency to provide an update on its efforts
within 60 days of enactment of this Act.
Regulation of Groundwater.—Since enact-
ment in 1972, the Clean Water Act (CWA) has
regulated impacts to navigable waters, while
VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:28 Mar 28, 2018 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00579 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A22MR7.046 H22MRPT2
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2624 March 22, 2018
regulation of groundwater has remained out-
side of the Act’s jurisdiction. Instead, legis-
lative history surrounding the CWA indi-
cates that Congress intended for ground-
water pollution to be regulated through
CWA’s nonpoint source programs and other
Federal and State laws. For example, re-
leases into groundwater from solid waste
units are regulated at a Federal level by the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA). Recently, some courts have imposed
a broad view of CWA liability based on a the-
ory of hydrological connection between
groundwater and surface water. Other courts
have taken a more narrow view and have fo-
cused on statutory distinctions between sur-
face water and groundwater. The Commit-
tees are aware that the Agency has re-
quested comment on its previous statements
‘‘regarding the Clean Water Act (CWA) and
whether pollutant discharges from point
sources that reach jurisdictional surface
waters via groundwater or other subsurface
flow that has a direct hydrologic connection
to the jurisdictional surface water may be
subject to CWA regulation.’’ After com-
pleting the public comment process, the
Committees encourage the Agency to con-
sider whether it is appropriate to promulgate
a rule to clarify that groundwater releases
from solid waste units are regulated under
RCRA and are not considered point sources,
and, that releases of pollutants through
groundwater are not subject to regulation as
point sources under the CWA. The Agency is
directed to brief the Committees about its
findings and any plans for future rule-
making.
Small Refinery Relief.—The Committees
continue the directive contained in Senate
Report 114–281 related to small refinery re-
lief. The Agency is reminded that, regardless
of the Department of Energy’s recommenda-
tion, additional relief may be granted if the
Agency believes it is warranted.
Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Risk
Evaluations.—Under the agreement, the
Agency is directed to implement the Frank
R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st
Century Act in a manner that reflects the
best available science as now required under
TSCA section 26.
Agricultural Operations.—The Committees
note that Congress never intended the Solid
Waste Disposal Act to govern animal or crop
waste, manure, or fertilizer, or constituents
derived from such sources. The Agency’s
longstanding regulations accurately reflect
Congress’ intent not to regulate manure and
crop residues under the Solid Waste Disposal
Act, and the Committees support legislative
efforts to clarify and codify the treatment of
agricultural byproducts under the Solid
Waste Disposal Act.
HAZARDOUS WASTE ELECTRONIC MANIFEST
SYSTEM FUND
The bill provides $3,674,000 which is ex-
pected to be fully offset by fees for a net ap-
propriation of $0. The Committees continue
to support the expeditious development of a
system that would allow for the electronic
tracking of hazardous waste shipments pur-
suant to Public Law 112–195.
The Committees realize the Agency is
transitioning from the developmental phase
to the implementation phase for the E–Mani-
fest System. Therefore, the Committees urge
the Agency to use an adequate portion of
funding to begin the implementation of the
Application Program Interface System
which will allow hazardous waste treatment,
storage, transport and disposal facilities to
interface their computer systems with those
of EPA to upload and download manifest and
other important information related to full
scale implementation of the system.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
The bill provides $41,489,000 for the Office
of Inspector General.
BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES
The bill provides $34,467,000 for Buildings
and Facilities.
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE SUPERFUND
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
The bill provides $1,091,947,000 for the Haz-
ardous Substance Superfund account and in-
cludes bill language to transfer $8,778,000 to
the Office of Inspector General account and
$15,496,000 to the Science and Technology ac-
count. When combined with an additional
$54,389,000 for the Superfund Remedial pro-
gram and an additional $8,611,000 for the
Superfund Emergency Response and Re-
moval program in a general provision in
Title IV, the bill provides a total of
$1,154,947,000 for the Hazardous Substance
Superfund. The bill provides the following
additional direction:
Enforcement.—The agreement provides
$166,375,000 for Superfund enforcement, equal
to the fiscal year 2017 enacted level. The
Committees do not concur with the proposed
elimination of financial support to the De-
partment of Justice (DOJ). The Agency is di-
rected to continue financial support of the
DOJ in fiscal year 2018 at a level that will
ensure the DOJ can continue to initiate and
prosecute civil, judicial, and administrative
site remediation cases and ensure that re-
sponsible parties perform cleanup actions at
sites where they are liable.
Additional Guidance.—The Committees
have provided the following additional guid-
ance with respect to funding provided under
this account:
Baseline Testing Study.—The Committees
direct the Agency to work with the Munici-
pality of Vieques to partner with a Univer-
sity-led coalition, which shall include a
School of Public Health, to conduct research
to facilitate the effective testing, evalua-
tion, quantification and mitigation of the
toxic substances in the soil, seas, plant, ani-
mal and human population of Vieques. This
effort will fill an information void at this
site, which functioned as a military training
installation for decades, and serve as the
baseline study for all potential future miti-
gation efforts.
Contaminants of Emerging Concern.—The
bill provides $181,306,000 in base funds for
Emergency Response and Removal activi-
ties. When combined with an additional
$8,611,000 in a general provision in Title IV,
the bill provides a total of $189,917,000 for
Emergency Response and Removal activi-
ties. These activities should include collabo-
rative work with State, Tribal, and local
governments to help communities address
contaminants of emerging concern. Further-
more, the Committees recommend that the
Agency expeditiously remediate Superfund
sites contaminated by these emerging con-
taminants, and provide technical assistance
and support to States and Tribes during the
remedial cleanup process.
Financial Assurance.—Since enactment of
the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA)
in 1980, Federal agencies like the Bureau of
Land Management and Forest Service have
created and updated financial assurance re-
quirements for reclamation and closure of
hardrock mining facilities on Federal lands.
Similarly, several States have developed fi-
nancial assurance programs for mining ac-
tivities occurring on private and State lands.
The Committees understand that, pursuant
to a Federal Register notice signed on De-
cember 11, 2017, the EPA will not impose new
Federal financial assurance requirements on
hardrock mining facilities.
Sediment Guidance.—When implementing
the recommendations of the Superfund Task
Force, the Agency should consider additional
improvements to the consistency of the ap-
plication of sediment guidance among re-
gions. At sites expected to exceed $50,000,000,
the Committees encourage the Agency to in-
clude the Contaminated Sediment Technical
Advisory Committee (CSTAG) and the Na-
tional Remedy Review Board (NRRB)
throughout the process and to ensure that
their technical review and remedy rec-
ommendations are evaluated and considered
for inclusion in the final remedy. Addition-
ally, the Committees encourage the Agency
to, consistent with National Oil and Haz-
ardous Substances Contingency Plan, set
achievable cleanup goals, broaden the use of
adaptive management and early actions, ex-
plore the utility of public-private partner-
ships similar, expand stakeholder participa-
tion, and promote cost-effectiveness, rede-
velopment, and sustainability in the Super-
fund process.
Tribal Guidance.—The Committees recog-
nize the importance of government-to-gov-
ernment Tribal consultation as well as the
necessity to honor Tribal treaty rights and
resources protected by treaties. The Agency
is directed to fully implement the Agency’s
Guidance for Discussing Tribal Treaty
Rights to ensure Agency actions adequately
consider treaty rights proactively through-
out the consultation process.
LEAKING UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK TRUST
FUND PROGRAM
The bill provides $91,941,000 for the Leaking
Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund Pro-
gram.
INLAND OIL SPILL PROGRAMS
The bill provides $18,209,000 for Inland Oil
Spill Programs.
STATE AND TRIBAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS
The bill provides $3,562,161,000 for the State
and Tribal Assistance Grants program and
includes the following specific funding levels
and direction:
Infrastructure Assistance.—The bill pro-
vides $2,486,120,000 in base funds for infra-
structure assistance. When combined with an
additional $650,000,000 in a Title IV general
provision, the bill provides a total of
$3,136,120,000 for infrastructure assistance.
The amount provided increases funding for
the State Revolving Loan Funds $600,000,000
above the fiscal year 2017 enacted level. The
agreement includes a total of $1,693,887,000
for the Clean Water State Revolving Loan
Fund and $1,163,233,000 for the Drinking
Water State Revolving Loan Fund.
Assistance to Small and Disadvantaged
Communities.—Within a Title IV general
provision, the bill provides $20,000,000 to
begin a grant program to help small and dis-
advantaged communities develop and main-
tain adequate water infrastructure. The pro-
gram was created in section 2104 of Public
Law 114–322. The Agency is directed to brief
the Committees prior to publishing its re-
quest for applications related to this new
grant program.
Reducing Lead in Drinking Water.—Within
a Title IV general provision, the bill provides
$10,000,000 to begin a grant program, created
in section 2105 of Public Law 114–322, to pro-
vide assistance to eligible entities for lead
reduction projects. The Agency is directed to
brief the Committees prior to publishing its
request for applications related to this new
grant program.
Lead Testing.—Within a Title IV general
provision, the bill provides $20,000,000 to
begin a grant program for voluntary testing
of drinking water for lead contaminants at
schools and child care facilities, as author-
ized in section 2107 of Public Law 114–322.
The Agency is directed to brief the Commit-
tees prior to publishing its request for appli-
cations related to this new grant program.
Brownfields Program.—The bill provides
$80,000,000 for brownfields grants and directs

that at least 10 percent of such grants be pro-
vided to areas in which at least 20 percent of
the population has lived under the poverty
level over the past 30 years as determined by
censuses and the most recent Small Area In-
come and Poverty Estimates.
Use of Iron and Steel.—The bill includes
language in Title IV General Provisions that
stipulates requirements for the use of iron
and steel in State Revolving Fund projects,
and the agreement includes only the fol-
lowing guidance. The Committees acknowl-
edge that EPA may issue a waiver of said re-
quirements for de minimis amounts of iron
and steel building materials. The Commit-
tees emphasize that any coating processes
that are applied to the external surface of
iron and steel components that otherwise
qualify under the procurement preference
shall not render such products ineligible for
the procurement preference regardless of
where the coating processes occur, provided
that final assembly of the products occurs in
the United States.
Diesel Emission Reductions Grants
(DERA).—The bill provides $75,000,000 for
DERA grants. For fiscal year 2018, the Com-
mittees direct the Agency to continue to
make at least 70 percent of DERA grants
available to improve air quality in non-at-
tainment areas.
Targeted Airshed Grants.—The bill pro-
vides $40,000,000 for targeted airshed grants
to reduce air pollution in non-attainment
areas. The Agency is directed to distribute
the grants on a competitive basis using the
same criteria as specified under this heading
in the explanatory statement accompanying
Division G of the Consolidated Appropria-
tions Act, 2017 (Public Law 115–31). Not later
than the end of fiscal year 2018, the Agency
should provide a report to the Committees
on Appropriations that includes a table
showing how fiscal year 2016 and 2017 funds
were allocated. The table should also include
grant recipients and metrics for anticipated
or actual results.
Animas River Spill.—The Committees con-
cur with the Agency’s decision to reconsider
its previous determination to deny claims
for damages from the Animas River Spill by
invoking the discretionary act exemption in
the Federal Tort Claims Act, but are con-
cerned that little progress has been made on
processing or paying out claims. The Com-
mittees are also concerned that the Agency
is applying or may apply an inconsistent
standard that discriminates against certain
claimants. The Committees expect the Agen-
cy and the Federal government to take a
clear and consistent position on the question
of whether they are responsible for damages
caused to others by the Gold King Mine re-
lease. The Committees support paying out
all legitimate claims from the Judgment
Fund, consistent with the Federal Tort
Claims Act, and communicating all relevant
aspects of the claims process clearly to all
affected communities, State, local and Trib-
al governments, along with the Committees.
Within 30 days of enactment of this Act, the
Agency shall provide to the Committees a
written report detailing the status of the re-
view of the legal basis for allowing or reject-
ing claims and the date by which such review
will be complete, the current process under-
way for processing claims, the status of all
claims, including reconsidered claims, the
Agency’s complete plan for processing all
claims, and any other future planned actions
related to current or future claims. Finally,
the bill provides $4,000,000 for a long-term
water quality monitoring program, as au-
thorized by Public Law 114–322. The Agency
is directed to continue to work in consulta-
tion with affected States and Tribes on that
effort.
Categorical Grants.—The bill provides
$1,076,041,000 for Categorical Grants and fund-
ing levels are specified in the table at the
end of this division. Within this amount, the
Beaches Protection program and Radon pro-
gram are both maintained at the fiscal year
2017 enacted levels. The Agency shall con-
tinue to allocate radon grants in fiscal year
2018 following the direction in House Report
114–632.
The amount also includes $228,219,000 for
the State and Local Air Quality Manage-
ment grant program, and the Agency is di-
rected to allocate funds for this program
using the same formula as fiscal year 2015.
The Committees understand the Office of Air
and Radiation was able to provide some addi-
tional funds to the States in fiscal year 2016
using balances. The Committees encourage
the Agency to do the same in fiscal year 2018
and to provide those additional funds to the
regions with the highest need.
Categorical Grant: Multipurpose Grants.—
Because the States are expected to take a
leading role in compliance with environ-
mental cleanup, the agreement provides
$10,000,000 for Multipurpose grants to States
and Tribes. The Committees were dis-
appointed with the Agency’s funding formula
in fiscal year 2016 because it did not provide
the flexibility that Congress expected and in-
stead gave preference to air programs. In fis-
cal year 2018, the Agency is directed to give
maximum flexibility to States, so that
States, not the Agency, may determine
where funds from this grant program are of
most value.
Categorical Grant: Nonpoint Source (Sec.
319).—The bill provides $170,915,000 and the
Committees expect the Agency to examine
the allocation formula to ensure that the re-
sources are being spent in areas with the
most pressing needs.
WATER INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE AND
INNOVATION PROGRAM ACCOUNT
The bill provides a total of $63,000,000 for
the Water Infrastructure Finance and Inno-
vation Act (WIFIA) program. Within base
funding in Title II, the bill provides
$10,000,000 for the WIFIA program, and a
Title IV general provision provides an addi-
tional $53,000,000 for the program. By uti-
lizing $5,000,000 in base funds and $3,000,000 in
Title IV funds, the Agency may use up to a
total of $8,000,000 to assist with the adminis-
trative expenses for the program. The re-
maining $55,000,000 in WIFIA funds is pro-
vided for direct loan subsidization which
may translate into a potential loan capacity
in excess of $6,000,000,000 to eligible entities
for water infrastructure projects.
Greater investment in the replacement of
aging infrastructure will help mitigate na-
tionwide issues the Committees are tracking
related to contaminants such as lead and ar-
senic, help address Combined Sewer Over-
flows and Sanitary Sewer Overflows, and
allow systems to improve water delivery for
residents. The Committees expect that the
Agency will issue loans for the first time in
fiscal year 2018 and the Committees intend
to closely monitor implementation.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS—ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION AGENCY
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS AND RESCISSION OF
FUNDS)
The bill continues several administrative
provisions from previous years.
Rescission.—The bill rescinds $96,198,000 of
unobligated balances from the State and
Tribal Assistance Grants account. The Agen-
cy shall calculate the requisite percent re-
duction necessary to rescind such amounts
from new obligational authority provided to
this account, both from the direct appropria-
tion and from amounts provided in a general
provision in Title IV, and apply it across pro-
gram project areas by formula. The Agency
is directed to submit, as part of the oper-
ating plan, detail on the application of such
rescissions by program project area.
TITLE III—RELATED AGENCIES
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
FOREST SERVICE
Forest Service Directives.—The Forest
Service is reminded of the importance of the
directives included in House Report 115–238
not specifically addressed herein, as well as
the new directives in this statement, includ-
ing the front matter, and the Committees
encourage the Service to share this state-
ment with all staff. The Service also is re-
minded to include the research report, as re-
quired by the House report, in its fiscal year
2020 budget request.
Forest Service Accounting, Budgeting, and
Management.—The Committees appreciate
the Service’s efforts to improve its account-
ing, budgeting, and management practices
and look forward to working with the Serv-
ice, Office of Budget and Program Analysis,
Under Secretary for Natural Resources and
Environment, and Secretary of Agriculture
to continue these improvements. The agree-
ment includes bill language and directives to
further increase transparency and confidence
in the Service’s management of its programs
and activities.
Government Accountability Office Re-
port.—Over the past three fiscal years, the
Committees have become increasingly con-
cerned about the Service’s lack of internal
controls over budgetary resources, reimburs-
able agreements, and unliquidated obliga-
tions. The lack of controls indicates a weak
financial system, which increases the possi-
bility of inefficient and ineffective use, if not
outright waste, fraud, and abuse, of taxpayer
funds. After conducting an 18-month audit,
the Government Accountability Office (GAO)
recently made 11 recommendations in a re-
port titled ‘‘Forest Service: Improvements
Needed in Internal Control over Budget Exe-
cution Process’’ (GAO–18–56). While the Serv-
ice is expected to implement the rec-
ommended changes as soon as practicable,
Congress also recognizes the challenges of
developing, updating, and implementing
these important fiscal controls. As such, the
Committees request that the Service work
with the Committees to remedy any hin-
drances to their implementation.
Standardized Budget Practices.—The Com-
mittees continue to support the Service’s ef-
forts in centralizing and standardizing budg-
eting and accounting practices among the
Regions and program offices and look for-
ward to reviewing the Service’s plan for up-
dating its budget process and presentation.
Integrated Resource Restoration Pilot
Project.—The agreement ends the Integrated
Resource Restoration pilot project. The
Committees remind the Service of its pre-
vious direction to adopt the best practices
and methods discovered through the pilot
project and to require unit, forest, region,
station, and Washington Office budgets to be
collaboratively developed, while reflecting
the priorities established by Congress.
Alignment of Funding and Program
Goals.—This fiscal year, Congress takes an
important step to increase transparency by
aligning program dollars to the accounts
that best meet program goals. For example,
in the past, Fire Plan Research and Develop-
ment has been funded from within the
Wildland Fire Management Account, yet its
funding was routinely transferred to the For-
est and Rangeland Research Account. This
agreement appropriates funds for Fire Plan
Research and Development within the Forest
and Rangeland Research account and Haz-
ardous Fuels within the National Forest Sys-
tem account to minimize unnecessary trans-
fers and increase transparency.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2626 March 22, 2018
Cost Pools.—The Service has been utilizing
Cost Pools to pay for certain costs associ-
ated with personnel, administrative activi-
ties, facilities, and other expenses rather
than utilizing an administrative account. As
part of continuing efforts to improve col-
laboration in budgeting, the Committees
have determined that ending the practice of
Cost Pools in favor of more direct account-
ing is in the best interest of the Service and
the taxpayer. The Committees are com-
mitted to working with the Service as it re-
views options for replacing Cost Pools. As
such, the Service is directed to develop a
plan to transition away from Cost Pools,
with the exception of Cost-Pool 9, which oc-
curs with this bill, and provide that plan to
the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations within 180 days of enactment of
this Act.
Cost-Pool 9.—For 12 years, the Service has
assessed program funds for facilities mainte-
nance needs, causing the funds appropriated
to programs to appear greater than they ac-
tually were. The Committees believe all fa-
cility projects should be accounted for in the
facility line item, and that projects should
be prioritized within that line item. As such,
this agreement moves funds from programs
to the dedicated facilities account. Where
such changes have been made, it is noted
within the account in this explanatory state-
ment. If the Service identifies shortfalls for
critical facilities maintenance needs, it is di-
rected to submit a reprogramming request to
the Committees. Additionally, the Service
should reduce the size of its facilities foot-
print, where possible, particularly in areas
where management functions can be com-
bined while still providing comprehensive
service to a geographic area.
National Fire Plan.—Despite more than
$5,000,000,000 in investments in hazardous
fuels mitigation since the development of
the National Fire Plan following the 2000 fire
season, the Service has not been able to keep
pace with the challenges caused by previous
management decisions, a changing climate,
ever-increasing costs, and an expanding
wildland-urban interface, all of which exac-
erbate the risk of catastrophic wildfire. The
Committees direct the Service to work with
the Office of Management and Budget and
the Department of the Interior, as well as
other relevant agencies, to review and up-
date the National Fire Plan, as needed.
Fire Hazard Potential Mapping Initia-
tive.—The Committees believe the Service
should more precisely and effectively target
forest management activities to reduce the
threat of catastrophic wildfires, improve the
management of the national forests, and as-
sist in protecting other Federal, State, and
private lands. The Service is directed to de-
velop a Fire Hazard Potential mapping tool
to identify areas at a high risk for wildland
fire and describe the resources that would be
necessary to address the highest risk areas.
The Service should cooperatively work with
universities, such as the University of Cali-
fornia and the University of Nevada, that
have expertise in this area, as well as the De-
partment of the Interior.
Printing Costs.—The Committees continue
to be concerned about the Service’s printing
costs. The Service is directed to provide up-
dated information as specified by Senate Re-
ports 114–70 and 114–82 within 60 days of en-
actment of this Act. The Service should pro-
vide a justification for its costs, explain why
they have not been reduced, and signifi-
cantly reduce printing expenditures.
Reprogramming.—The Committees remind
the Service to follow the letter and spirit of
the reprogramming requirements in this ex-
planatory statement and direct the Service
to submit requests through the Office of
Budget and Program Analysis.
Ceratocystis Disease.—The Service is di-
rected to continue its collaborative efforts
to respond to the emergence of Ceratocystis
disease in Hawaii and Florida and to develop
recommended actions.
Puerto Rico Hurricane Recovery.—The
Committees recognize the devastating ef-
fects of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico’s
natural resources, especially El Yunque Na-
tional Forest, the International Institute of
Tropical Forestry, and private forests, and
strongly encourage the Service to utilize its
expertise, working with private partners and
the Government of Puerto Rico, to restore
and rehabilitate the island’s unique forest
ecosystems.
OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR
NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT
The bill provides $875,000 for the Office of
the Under Secretary for Natural Resources
and Environment. In previous fiscal years,
the Office was funded through the Agri-
culture, Rural Development, Food and Drug
Administration, and Related Agencies Ap-
propriations Act. This action aligns funding
for the Office consistent with the 2017 reor-
ganization of U.S. Department of Agri-
culture agencies and offices.
FOREST AND RANGELAND RESEARCH
The agreement provides $297,000,000 for
Forest and Rangeland Research, including
$77,000,000 for Forest Inventory and Analysis.
The Service is directed to continue impor-
tant work previously funded through the
Wildland Fire Management account for Fire
Plan Research and Development that signifi-
cantly contributes to the understanding of
wildfire regimes.
Cost-Pool 9.—The Committees note that
funding previously assessed for Cost-Pool 9
from Forest and Rangeland Research is now
accounted for in Capital Improvement and
Maintenance.
Forest Research Priorities.—The Commit-
tees are concerned that the research pro-
gram is not well aligned with the needs of
the National Forest System. When assessing
the value of existing programs and new pro-
posals, significant weight should be given to
projects whose findings could be incor-
porated into forest management decisions.
Within the funds provided, the agreement in-
cludes sufficient funding to support existing
academic partners focused on research and
technology development to create new and
expanded markets and to advance high-
value, high-volume wood markets; wood
bridge and other infrastructure needs in
rural areas; bottomland hardwood plantation
management research; and forest monitoring
cooperatives in the Northern Region.
Research Reports.—The Committees direct
the Service to cease publishing, within 30
days of enactment of this Act, paper copies
for public distribution of science and re-
search accomplishment reports and to redi-
rect these funds to priority research
projects, consistent with reprogramming re-
quirements.
STATE AND PRIVATE FORESTRY
(INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)
The agreement provides $335,525,000 for
State and Private Forestry.
Cooperative Forestry Activities.—The
Committees direct the Service to continue
to utilize existing partnerships with research
institutions and States to fund research to
establish methods, tools, and standard proto-
cols that help quantify forest ecosystem
services. Additionally, when funding deci-
sions are made regarding tree mortality,
strong consideration should be given to
spruce beetle, Emerald Ash Borer, and bark
beetle infestations, which affect forests
throughout the Nation.
Forest Legacy.—The bill provides
$67,025,000 for the Forest Legacy program.
This includes $6,400,000 for program adminis-
tration and $60,625,000 for projects. The Serv-
ice should fund projects in priority order ac-
cording to the updated, competitively se-
lected national priority list submitted to the
Committees and the directive contained in
Division G of the explanatory statement ac-
companying Public Law 115–31, the Consoli-
dated Appropriations Act, 2017. The Commit-
tees include a rescission of $5,938,000 in For-
est Legacy funds. This funding rescission is
from cost savings of some projects and funds
returned from failed or partially failed
projects.
International Forestry Technical Assist-
ance.—The Committees acknowledge that
Timor-Leste and Australia have entered into
a treaty to establish a permanent maritime
boundary. The Committees recognize the in-
creased development that will likely occur
and encourage the Service to provide tech-
nical assistance, as appropriate, to Timor-
Leste to protect the unique biodiversity of
the region while facilitating robust eco-
nomic development.
NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM
The agreement provides $1,923,750,000 for
the National Forest System.
Cost-Pool 9.—The Committees note that
funding previously assessed for Cost-Pool 9
from the National Forest System is now ac-
counted for in Capital Improvement and
Maintenance.
Hazardous Fuels.—The agreement provides
$430,000,000 for hazardous fuels management
activities within the National Forest System
account. With the accounting change for
Cost-Pool 9, this is a $45,500,000 increase over
the fiscal year 2017 level. Within the total
provided, $15,000,000 is for biomass utilization
grants, in accordance with the directions in-
cluded in Senate Report 114–281. The Com-
mittees direct the Service to prioritize haz-
ardous fuel removal projects that are critical
to protecting public safety in high hazard
areas in the national forests facing signifi-
cant tree mortality and to increase cross-
boundary collaboration with landowners
near National Forest System lands and en-
courage the use of hazardous fuels funding
for this purpose.
Uinta National Forest.—The Committees
are concerned about the number of dead and
dying trees in the Mirror Lake Scenic Byway
region in the Uinta National Forest and urge
the Service to evaluate the risk of wildfire to
the area and target management practices
accordingly.
Grazing Fee Rates.—The Service is di-
rected to provide information to the Com-
mittees detailing the implications on graz-
ing fee calculations if the Service adopted
the definition of Western States as defined
by Public Law 95–514.
Recreation, Heritage and Wilderness.— The
Committees have been made aware that the
majority of recreation special-use permit-
ting activities take place in the Landowner-
ship and Access Management subaccount,
previously known as Landownership Manage-
ment. Given the importance of special-use
permitting activities to users of our national
forests and concerns about significant delays
in processing requests, funding is included to
increase the pace and scale of such activi-
ties. Within the funds provided for recre-
ation, $750,000 shall be for the maintenance
of rural airstrips and $500,000 is made avail-
able to support infrastructure and trails de-
velopment and to build the capacity of local
user groups and partnership organizations
for all National Recreation Areas adminis-
tered by the Service that were established
after 1997.
Law Enforcement.—The agreement pro-
vides $2,500,000 for the Service’s illegal mari-
juana eradication and remediation efforts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2627
March 22, 2018
Lake Tahoe.—The Committees are encour-
aged by the work conducted in the Lake
Tahoe Basin Management Unit and expect
the Service to prioritize funding the imple-
mentation of P.L. 106–506, as amended, and to
do so in consultation with affected States,
local governments, and other stakeholders.
Within 60 days of enactment of this Act, the
Service shall report to the Committees on
these activities and the funding that will be
allocated in fiscal year 2018.
Tongass National Forest.—Without a com-
prehensive stand-level inventory, the transi-
tion plan described by the Tongass Land and
Resource Management Plan Amendment
lacks the scientific basis needed for success,
and no less than $1,000,000 is provided for the
continuation of the inventory currently un-
derway. The Committees expect the Service
to meet the requirements of section 705(a) of
the Alaska National Interest Lands Con-
servation Act (16 U.S.C. 539d(a)) and to con-
sider a plan revision or new plan amendment
based on the results of the inventory. Any
plan revision or amendment should include a
timber management program sufficient to
preserve a viable timber industry in the re-
gion. Until the Service has determined,
based on a completed stand-level inventory,
the timing and supply of economic young
growth needed for a successful final transi-
tion and whether the 2016 Forest Plan should
be amended or revised, the Service is di-
rected not to implement a final transition
away from its Tongass old growth timber
program to a program based primarily on
young growth.
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The agreement provides $449,000,000 for
Capital Improvement and Maintenance pro-
grams. This includes $49,986,000 made avail-
able by discontinuing the use of Cost-Pool 9
and $35,000,000 in one-time infrastructure
funding to address deferred maintenance.
Legacy Roads and Trails.—The Commit-
tees recognize the need to remediate legacy
roads and trails and direct the Service to ad-
dress these projects as they rank in priority
along with all other infrastructure needs
from the appropriations provided for roads
and trails through the Capital Improvement
and Maintenance account and provide
$40,000,000 within the Roads budget line item.
Smokejumper Bases.—The agreement pro-
vides funds for repairs, maintenance, and up-
grades at smokejumper bases to ensure oper-
ational readiness.
Green Mountain and Finger Lakes Na-
tional Forests.—The Committees urge the
Service to address longstanding capital im-
provement needs in the Green Mountain and
Finger Lakes National Forests, particularly
those that will save the Service money while
also improving the public’s access and use of
these forests.
Comprehensive Capital Improvement
Plan.—The Service is directed to establish a
long-term, multi-year plan to guide needed
investments in buildings, facilities, trans-
portation systems, and other infrastructure
by December 30, 2018. The plan should: (1) es-
tablish a process for setting and ranking
construction and maintenance priorities; (2)
reflect the Service’s mission, goals, and re-
quirements; (3) identify facilities, roads, and
other infrastructure that should be disposed
of or decommissioned; (4) consider existing
investments in planning, construction, and
maintenance, as well as deferred mainte-
nance needs; and (5) identify future needs for
investment to improve the physical infra-
structure and health of the national forests.
The plan also should include estimated fund-
ing requirements. In future budget requests,
the Service is directed to provide the Com-
mittees with a list of any proposed construc-
tion project with a cost greater than
$1,000,000.
LAND ACQUISITION
The agreement provides $64,337,000 for
Land Acquisition. The amounts provided by
this bill compared with the budget estimates
by activity and project are shown in the
table below, listed in priority order pursuant
to the project list received for fiscal year
2018. The Service is expected to use the Crit-
ical Inholdings/Wilderness account to ac-
quire high priority lands, such as wilderness
and lands of significant value in designated
conservation units, to consolidate Federal
ownership. The Committees strongly encour-
age the Service to close projects once funds
have been made available, an appraisal has
been completed, and a purchase contract has
been agreed to. Further instructions are con-
tained under the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund heading in the front of this ex-
planatory statement.
The Committees support the continuation
of efforts to resolve the long-standing man-
agement challenges regarding school trust
lands within the Boundary Waters Canoe
Area in the Superior National Forest in Min-
nesota and encourage the Service to collabo-
rate with nonprofit partners on the private
forestland exchange alternative, which will
provide the added benefit of preserving valu-
able forestlands outside of Superior National
Forest.

tees recognize Unmanned Aerial Systems
(UAS) can aid incident commanders as well
as improve the safety of firefighters and the
public. As such, the Service is expected to
work with the Department of the Interior
and the Federal Aviation Administration’s
Center of Excellence for Unmanned Aircraft
Systems to continue evaluating these sys-
tems’ use and to develop an overall strategy
for integrating this additional tool into the
Federal firefighting mission. The Commit-
tees also recognize that certain satellite-
based ground surveillance systems could sig-
nificantly improve the accuracy of informa-
tion provided to fire-fighters, other first re-
sponders, and communities and encourage
the Service to seek opportunities to utilize
these satellite systems, as appropriate, as

project shall be undertaken that increases
recurring program costs. Within 60 days of
enactment of this Act, the Service shall pro-
vide a complete list of anticipated projects
to the Committees on Appropriations uti-
lizing this entire amount. The Committees
expect these funds to be obligated in fiscal
years 2018 and 2019.
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE
INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES
The agreement provides a total of
$5,537,764,000 for the Indian Health Service
(IHS), of which $3,952,290,000 is for the Serv-
ices account as detailed below and in the
funding allocation table at the end of this
explanatory statement. All proposed cuts are
restored, and increases above the fiscal year
2017 enacted levels are detailed below and in
the table. The Service is reminded of the
guidance and reporting requirements con-
tained in House Report 115–238 which must be
complied with unless specifically addressed
to the contrary herein, as explained in the
front matter of this explanatory statement.
Current Services.—The agreement provides
$93,935,000 to partially cover the cost of
maintaining current levels of service, of
which $23,543,000 is for pay costs and
$70,392,000 is for medical inflation.
Indian Health Care Improvement Fund.—
The agreement provides $72,280,000 for the In-
dian Health Care Improvement Fund. The
Committees recognize the funding dispari-
ties that exist across the Indian Health Serv-
ice system and the ongoing efforts by Tribes
and the Service to update the allocation for-
mula accordingly. Upon completion of these
efforts, the Service is directed to update the
Committees on the resulting allocations.
Staffing for New Facilities.—The agree-
ment includes $60,336,000 for staffing newly
opened health facilities, which is the full
amount based upon updated estimates pro-
vided to the Committees. Funds for the staff-
ing of new facilities are limited to facilities
funded through the Health Care Facilities
Construction Priority System or the Joint
Venture Construction Program that have
opened in fiscal year 2017 or will open in fis-
cal year 2018. None of these funds may be al-
located to a facility until such facility has
achieved beneficial occupancy status.
Accreditation Emergencies.—The Commit-
tees consider the loss or potential loss of a
Medicare or Medicaid agreement with the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS) at any facility to be an accreditation
emergency. The agreement includes
$58,000,000 for accreditation emergencies at
an increasing number of direct service facili-
ties, and is based upon updated and itemized
information provided to the Committees on
December 13, 2017. The Service is encouraged
to share this information with Tribes, and to
keep Tribes and the Committees apprised of
any need for significant deviations from the
planned used of funds. Bill language has been
added as requested to allow the use of a por-
tion of the funds for facility expansion or
renovation and staff quarters.
Of the amounts provided, no less than
$20,000,000 is directed to facilities for pur-
chased/referred care, replacement of third-
party revenues lost as a result of decertifica-
tion, replacement of third-party carryover
funds expended to respond to decertification,
and reasonable costs of achieving recertifi-
cation, including recruitment costs nec-
essary to stabilize staffing. Primary consid-
eration should be given but is not limited to
facilities that have been without certifi-
cation the longest. Such funds shall be made
available to Tribes assuming operation of
such facilities pursuant to the Indian Self-
Determination and Education Assistance Act
of 1975 (P.L. 93–638).
The Committees are concerned by the con-
tinued occurrence of deficiencies in patient
care, facilities and hospital administration
at IHS facilities, including the recent identi-
fication of these deficiencies at the Gallup
Indian Medical Center (GIMC) by the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
and the Joint Commission. It is imperative
that the Service take all needed steps to en-
sure patient safety, improve the quality of
care, and ensure that GIMC does not lose ac-
cess to third-party reimbursements, which
account for more than 90 percent of the fa-
cility’s funding. Within 90 days of enactment
of this Act, the Service is directed to provide
a report to the Committees that details all
actions taken to address the deficiencies
identified by CMS and the Joint Commission
and a list of any outstanding recommenda-
tions that require future action by GIMC or
the Service to implement. The Service is ex-
pected to include its corrective action plans
submitted to CMS and the Joint Commission
as well as the CMS 2567 deficiency report as
part of this report.
Hospitals and Health Clinics.—The agree-
ment provides $2,045,128,000 for hospitals and
health clinics, including: $36,242,000 for cur-
rent services; $43,708,000 for staffing new fa-
cilities; $1,000,000 for retinal cameras;
$58,000,000 for accreditation emergencies as
discussed above; $11,000,000 to continue oper-
ations and maintenance of village built and

$195,283,000 and includes $5,864,000 for current
services and $6,822,000 for staffing new facili-
ties. The Service is directed to backfill va-
cant dental health positions in headquarters
and encouraged to coordinate with the Bu-
reau of Indian Education to integrate pre-
ventive dental care at schools across the sys-
tem.
Mental Health.—The agreement provides
$99,900,000 for mental health programs and
includes: $2,891,000 for current services;
$2,929,000 for staffing of new facilities;
$6,946,000 to continue behavioral health inte-
gration; and $3,600,000 to continue the suicide
prevention initiative.
Alcohol and Substance Abuse.—The agree-
ment provides $227,788,000 for alcohol and
substance abuse programs and includes:
$8,220,000 for current services; $1,215,000 for
staffing new facilities; $6,500,000 for the Gen-
eration Indigenous initiative; $1,800,000 for
the youth pilot project; and $2,000,000 to fund
essential detoxification and related services
provided by the Service’s public and private
partners to IHS beneficiaries. The Commit-
tees expect the Service to continue its part-
nership with the Na’ Nizhoozhi Center in
Gallup, New Mexico, as directed by the Con-
solidated Appropriations Act, 2017, and to
distribute funds provided for detoxification
services in the same manner as in fiscal year
2017.
Purchased/Referred Care.—The agreement
provides $962,695,000 and includes $32,327,000
for current services and $1,538,000 for staffing
new facilities. The Committees remain con-
cerned about the inequitable distribution of
funds as reported by the Government Ac-
countability Office (GAO–12–446).
Public Health Nursing.—The agreement
provides $85,043,000 for public health nursing
and includes $2,702,000 for current services
and $3,640,000 for staffing new facilities.
Health Education.—The agreement pro-
vides $19,871,000 for health education and in-
cludes $724,000 for current services and
$484,000 for staffing new facilities.
Urban Indian Health.—The agreement pro-
vides $49,315,000 for urban Indian health and
includes $1,637,000 for current services. The
Service is expected to continue to include
current services estimates for urban Indian
health in future budget requests.
The Committees direct the Service to work
with Veterans Affairs on the report exam-
ining services for Indian veterans at urban
clinics as outlined in House Report 115–188
accompanying the Fiscal Year 2018 Military
Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related
Agencies Appropriations bill.
Indian Health Professions.—The agreement
provides $49,363,000 for Indian health profes-
sions and includes $18,000 for current serv-
ices. Within funds, the agreement includes
funding for the Quentin N. Burdick Amer-
ican Indians into Nursing Program, Indians
into Medicine Program, and American Indi-
ans into Psychology Program at no less than
fiscal year 2017 enacted levels.
Extension Services.—The Committees con-
tinue to be concerned about the urgent need
for skilled health providers in AI/AN commu-
nities and are encouraged by the success of
the University of New Mexico’s Project
ECHO—Extension for Community Healthcare
Outcomes—in delivering timely care to un-
derserved communities. The Service shall
consider how Project ECHO could support ex-
isting Indian Health Service providers, and
how potential partnerships with Project
ECHO could aid in the recruitment and re-
tention of healthcare providers to IHS sites,
thereby expanding the provider network and
improving access to care.
Patient Wait Times.—The Committees are
encouraged by the Service’s recent focus on
improving wait times for patients seeking
primary and urgent care, including the Au-
gust 2017 publication of Circular No. 17–11
and related efforts to track, report, and im-
prove patient wait times. The Committees
direct the Service to provide a report to the
Committees on the status of these efforts no
later than 90 days after enactment of this
Act. This report shall include a clear expla-
nation of how these efforts will address
GAO’s recommendation in report number
GAO–16–333 of setting and monitoring agen-
cy-wide standards for patient wait times in
federally operated facilities and an analysis
of any potential barriers to continued moni-
toring of wait times caused by IT infrastruc-
ture limitations or incompatibility.
The Committees request that the Service
provide, no later than 90 days after the date
of enactment of this Act, a detailed plan
with specific amounts identified to fully
fund and implement the Indian Health Care
Improvement Act, as discussed in House Re-
port 115–238.
Reimbursable Funding.—This agreement
directs the Service to report, within 180 days
of enactment of this Act, on patient popu-
lation and service growth over the past ten
years and the funding sources used to pro-
vide for these medical services. The Service
is to include a breakdown, by dollar amount
and percentage, of funding sources which
supplement appropriated dollars to cover the
provision of medical services at Service oper-
ated facilities. The Committees are inter-
ested in detailed information on whether

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2629
March 22, 2018
medical services have been able to expand
over this time period as a result of increases
in the ability to charge medical services due
to new authorities outlined in the Indian
Health Care Improvement Act and other
Federal laws. As a point of comparison, and
to the extent possible, the Service shall com-
pare these impacts across the twelve Service
areas, with the degree to which patient popu-
lation services in the respective States has
increased.
Quality of Care.—The Committees are ex-
tremely concerned about the lack of access
to quality healthcare for Tribes around the
Nation, including the ongoing healthcare
quality problems in the Great Plains. In
order to address these issues, the agreement
includes a pilot program and related direc-
tives to improve access to quality health
services and to improve recruitment and re-
tention of qualified medical personnel as de-
tailed below:
Housing Improvements.—In addition to
funds provided for staffing quarters within
the Facilities Appropriation, the administra-
tive provisions section of the bill also con-
tains new language allowing for a program
to provide a housing subsidy to medical per-
sonnel at facilities operated by the Indian
Health Service. The Committees are con-
cerned that the lack of affordable and avail-
able housing plays a significant role in the
agency’s personnel vacancy rates and con-
tributes to lowering the quality of care. The
Committees expect the Service to provide a
plan within 90 days of enactment of this Act
that details how the agency plans to use this
authority in fiscal year 2018, including the
measures it will use to determine whether
the authority is successful and how it should
be expanded in future years. The Committees
have added funds for accreditation emer-
gencies that could be made available for this
purpose. The Committees also direct the
Service to work with Tribes and with the De-
partment of Housing and Urban Development
to develop a long-term strategy to address
professional housing shortages in Indian
Country and to ensure that the Service and
its partner agencies are fully utilizing exist-
ing authorities to improve the availability of
housing stock.
Workforce Development.—The Committees
believe that expanded workforce develop-
ment training for all Service personnel—in-
cluding non-clinical personnel—must be part
of efforts to improve healthcare quality. In
addition to continuing skills development
opportunities, the Committees believe that
IHS should expand its efforts to provide edu-
cation to all staff, and Federal employee
management training to facility and area
leadership that will provide employees a bet-
ter understanding of their obligations to re-
port failures in quality of care.
Title 38 Personnel Authorities.—The Com-
mittees are aware of significant differences
between the personnel authorities used by
the Service versus the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs (VA) under Title 38 of the
United States Code. The Committees believe
that an analysis of these differences—which
include hiring and benefits authorities—may
provide strategies for recruiting and retain-
ing qualified personnel in the same rural and
remote locations as the VA. The Committees
direct the Service to work with the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services to ana-
lyze the differences between the two agen-
cies’ personnel authorities and to submit a
report no later than 90 days after enactment
of this Act that details the differences and
makes specific legislative recommendations,
as appropriate, to provide parity between the
two agencies.
ISDEAA Contracts.—The Committees en-
courage the transfer of amounts provided to
tribal organizations for the Substance Abuse
and Suicide Prevention Program, for the Do-
mestic Violence Prevention Program, for the
Zero Suicide Initiative, for aftercare pilots
at Youth Regional Treatment Centers, and
to improve collections from public and pri-
vate insurance at tribally-operated facilities
to such organizations through Indian Self-
Determination Act compacts and contracts,
and not through separate grant instruments.
This will ensure that associated administra-
tive costs will be covered though the con-
tract support cost process.
CONTRACT SUPPORT COSTS
The agreement continues language from
fiscal year 2017 establishing an indefinite ap-
propriation for contract support costs esti-
mated to be $717,970,000, which is equal to the
request. By retaining an indefinite appro-
priation for this account, additional funds
may be provided by the agency if its budget
estimate proves to be lower than necessary
to meet the legal obligation to pay the full
amount due to Tribes. The Committees be-
lieve fully funding these costs will ensure
Tribes have the necessary resources they
need to deliver program services efficiently
and effectively.
INDIAN HEALTH FACILITIES
The bill provides $867,504,000 for Indian
Health Facilities. In addition to the funding
allocation table at the end of this explana-
tory statement, the agreement includes the
following details and changes relative to fis-
cal year 2017 enacted levels:
Staffing for New Facilities.—The agree-
ment includes $5,480,000 for staffing newly
opened health facilities, which is the full
amount based upon updated estimates pro-
vided to the Committees. The stipulations
included in the ‘‘Indian Health Services’’ ac-
count regarding the allocation of funds per-
tain to this account as well.
Current Services.—The agreement provides
$4,329,000 to partially cover the cost of main-
taining current levels of service, of which
$2,440,000 is for pay costs and $1,889,000 is for
medical inflation.
Indian Health Care Improvement Fund.—
The bill includes language allowing funds in
the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund
to be used for activities in the Facilities ac-
count.
Maintenance and Improvement.—The
agreement provides $167,527,000. The Service
is directed to use this increase to address the
backlog of essential maintenance, alteration
and repair (BEMAR) and to provide a spend
plan within 60 days of enactment of this Act
detailing how IHS plans to utilize this fund-
ing.
Sanitation Facilities.—The agreement pro-
vides $192,033,000 for sanitation facilities con-
struction and includes $261,000 for current
services. The Committees expect the Service
to continue following its existing interpreta-
tion of criteria for the funding of new, im-
proved, or replacement sanitation facilities.
Health Care Facilities Construction.—The
agreement provides $243,480,000 for health
care facilities construction and includes
$15,000,000 for small ambulatory clinics and
$11,489,000 for staff quarters.
The Committees remain dedicated to pro-
viding access to health care for IHS patients
across the system. The IHS is expected to ag-
gressively work down the current Health Fa-
cilities Construction Priority System list, as
well as work with the Department and
Tribes to examine alternative financing ar-
rangements and meritorious regional dem-
onstration projects authorized under the In-
dian Health Care Improvement Act that
would effectively close the service gap. With-
in 60 days of enactment of this Act, the Serv-
ice shall submit a spending plan to the Com-
mittees on Appropriations that details the
project-level distribution of funds provided
for healthcare facilities construction.
The Committees believe that additional
funds for quarters is essential to help resolve
the widespread housing shortages which have
contributed to high vacancy rates for med-
ical personnel throughout the system, par-
ticularly in rural areas. These funds have
been used in areas with chronic housing
shortages like Alaska and the Great Plains
in order to ameliorate these problems. The
Committees expect a report from the Service
within 60 days of enactment of this Act on
the distribution of funds.
The Service is reminded of the directive in
House Report 115–238 regarding the comple-
tion and publication of a gap analysis.
The Committees strongly support the
small ambulatory clinic program. This pro-
gram provides another critical tool for ad-
dressing facilities maintenance and con-
struction backlogs throughout the nation.
In advance of the opening of the Sacred
Oaks Healing Center in California in late
2019, and within available funds, the Service
is expected to construct a left-turn lane and
make other safety improvements rec-
ommended by the Service’s 2017 transpor-
tation impact study. The Service is further
directed to report to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations within 60
days of enactment of this Act regarding the
status of the project.
Facilities and Environmental Health Sup-
port.—The agreement provides $240,758,000
for facilities and environmental health sup-
port and includes: $3,328,000 for current serv-
ices; $5,480,000 for staffing new facilities; and
a $5,000,000 program increase to address the
increased workload in construction. The
Service is expected to provide a spend plan
within 60 days of enactment of this Act for
the additional infrastructure funding pro-
vided above the fiscal year 2017 enacted
level.

provide funds as requested for the Institu-
tion’s Latino initiatives and support the
Smithsonian Latino Center’s goal of pro-
moting the inclusion of Latino contributions
in Smithsonian Institution programs, exhibi-
tions, collections, and public outreach. The
Committees continue to urge collaboration
between the Smithsonian Latino Center and
appropriate Federal and local organizations
in order to advance these goals and expand
the American Latino presence at the Institu-
tion. Further, the Committees provide funds
as requested for the Institution’s Asian Pa-
cific American initiatives and continue to
support the Institution’s efforts of devel-
oping programs and expanding outreach to

the replacement of the building’s façade and
internal building systems. The recommenda-
tion includes $198,000,000 for this critical re-
vitalization effort. The Institution is di-
rected to follow the reprogramming guide-
lines contained in this explanatory state-
ment and may not redirect the use of these
funds for other capital projects without prior
approval of the Committees. Given the scale
of the project, the Committees direct the In-
stitution to make available to the Commit-
tees on a timely basis the most updated and
comprehensive information on project and
funding requirements. The Government Ac-
countability Office is also directed to con-
tinue its review and analysis of the project’s
cost estimates, as directed in the Consoli-
dated Appropriation Act, 2017 (P.L. 115–31).
The Committees urge the Smithsonian to
evaluate potential partnership opportunities
that may provide non-Federal funding
sources to advance this and other revitaliza-
tion projects. The Institution is directed to
submit to the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations, within 60 days of enact-

The agreement provides $12,000,000 for the
Woodrow Wilson International Center for
Scholars.
NATIONAL FOUNDATION ON THE ARTS AND THE
HUMANITIES
NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS
GRANTS AND ADMINISTRATION
The agreement provides $152,849,000 for the
National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) to
continue the important work of the Endow-
ment. Changes to the enacted level are in-
cluded in the detail table accompanying this
agreement, and the agency is expected to use
the increases provided for direct grants to
expand its Creative Forces: Military Healing
Arts Network and to increase grants made
available to Tribes and to rural and under-
served areas. The Committees particularly
commend the NEA for its work incor-
porating arts therapy into the treatment of
active-duty military patients, veterans, and
their families through its Creative Forces:
Military Healing Arts Network. This suc-
cessful program places creative arts thera-
pies at the core of patient-centered care and
increases access to therapeutic arts thera-
pies at Walter Reed National Military Med-
ical Center, Fort Belvoir Community Hos-
pital, and eleven other clinical sites across
the United States. The Committees support
the expansion of this successful program to
assist service members and their families in
their recovery, reintegration, and transition
to civilian life. The Committees also urge
State arts agencies to explore how they can
contribute to expanding arts programs for
service members and their families at the
local level. The Committees acknowledge
there are currently vacancies on the Na-
tional Council on the Arts and many mem-
bers have agreed to continue to serve even
though their term has expired. While the
Council has the ability to operate and con-
duct important work, the Committees en-
courage the timely appointment of members.
The Committees value greatly the long-
standing collaborative relationship between
the NEA and the States. The Committees di-
rect that priority be given to providing serv-
ices and grant funding for projects, produc-
tions, or programs that encourage public
knowledge, education, understanding, and
appreciation of the arts. The Committees
maintain support for the 40 percent alloca-
tion for State arts agencies as allocated in
previous years. Any reduction in support to
the States for arts education should be no
more than proportional to other funding de-
creases taken in other NEA programs.
NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES
GRANTS AND ADMINISTRATION
The agreement provides $152,848,000 for the
National Endowment for the Humanities
(NEH) to continue the important work of the
Endowment. Changes to the enacted level
are included in the detail table accom-
panying this agreement, and the agency is
expected to use increases provided to expand
its work with Tribes to preserve Native lan-
guages and culture as detailed below as well
as to support other local history preserva-
tion initiatives. Funds are also provided
within the Challenge Grants program to sup-
port NEH’s local infrastructure and capacity
building grant program. The Committees ac-
knowledge there are currently vacancies on
the National Council on the Humanities and
many members have agreed to continue to
serve even though their term has expired.
While the Council has the ability to operate
and conduct important work, the Commit-
tees encourage the timely appointment of
members. The Committees commend the
NEH for its support of grant programs to
benefit wounded warriors and to ensure edu-
cational opportunities for American heroes
transitioning to civilian life. The Commit-
tees commend the NEH for its ongoing sup-
port to American Indian and Alaska Native
communities in preserving their cultural and
linguistic heritage through the Documenting
Endangered Languages program and a vari-
ety of preservation and access grants that
enable American Indian and Alaska Native
communities to preserve cultural artifacts
and make them broadly accessible. The Com-
mittees also support NEH efforts to provide
educational opportunities for tribal commu-
nities through Humanities Initiatives at
Tribal Colleges and Universities. The Com-
mittees commend the NEH Federal/State
partnership for its ongoing, successful col-
laboration with State humanities councils in
each of the 50 States as well as Washington,
DC, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the
U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Common-
wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and
American Samoa. The Committees urge the
NEH to provide program funding to support
the critical work of State humanities coun-
cils consistent with guidance provided in the
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L.
115–31). The Committees encourage NEH to
continue providing support to two popular
components of the ‘‘We the People’’ initia-
tive, the National Digital Newspapers Pro-
gram (NDNP) and the Landmarks of Amer-
ican History and Culture workshop that
focus on our Nation’s history and culture.
