RAISING A QUESTION OF THE
PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I
rise to a question of the privileges of
the House and send to the desk a privi-
leged resolution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the resolution.
The Clerk read as follows:
H. RES. 770
Whereas Chairman Schiff and Chairman
Nadler willfully and intentionally violated
the Rules of the House of Representatives by
abusing and exceeding their powers as Chair-
men of Committees;
Whereas, on September 9, 2019, without
consultation of the Ranking Minority Mem-
ber, in violation of rule 9 of the Rules of the
Permanent Select Committee on Intel-
ligence, Chairman Schiff, in coordination
with the Committees on Oversight and Re-
form and Foreign Affairs announced a wide-
ranging investigation into the ‘‘Trump-
Giuliani Ukraine scheme’’;
Whereas, on September 26, 2019, in an un-
precedented action, Chairman Schiff unilat-
erally released a redacted version of the Au-
gust 2019 whistleblower complaint;
Whereas, on September 26, 2019, in his
opening statement at a public hearing,
Chairman Schiff engaged in a false retelling
of the July 25, 2019 telephone conversation
between President Trump and President
Zelensky;
Whereas, on November 20, 2019, a letter was
transmitted from the Ranking Minority
Member to Chairman Schiff requesting, pur-
suant to House Resolution 660, the concur-
rence of the chair to issue certain subpoenas;
Whereas, on November 20, 2019, after excus-
ing the witnesses at an open hearing, and
without prior notice to the Republicans on
the Committee, Chairman Schiff announced
that the Committee had a ‘‘business matter
to take up’’ and convened an impromptu
business meeting to consider the Ranking
Minority Member’s November 20 request con-
cerning certain subpoenas;
Whereas, on November 20, 2019, Chairman
Schiff violated clause 2(g)(3) of rule XI of the
Rules of the House of Representatives, which
states, ‘‘The chair of a committee shall an-
nounced the date, place, and subject matter
of. . .a committee meeting, which may not
commence earlier than the third calendar
day. . .on which members have notice there-
of’’;
Whereas, on November 20, 2019, Chairman
Schiff’s actions further violated paragraph
4(B) of House Resolution 660, which states,
‘‘In the case that the chair declines to con-
cur in a proposed action of the ranking mi-
nority member. . .the ranking minority
member shall have the right to refer to the
committee for decision the question whether
such authority shall be so exercised and the
chair shall convene the committee promptly
to render that decision, subject to the notice
procedures for a committee meeting under
clause 2(g)(3)(A) and (B) of rule XI’’;
Whereas, on November 21, 2019, pursuant to
clause 2(j)(1) of rule XI of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, all Republican
Members on the Permanent Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence wrote to Chairman
Schiff demanding to call witnesses at a mi-
nority day of hearings;
Whereas, subsequent to receiving the re-
quest for an additional day of hearings by
members of the minority party, Chairman
Schiff refused to schedule such hearings;
Whereas, on December 6, 2019, Chairman
Schiff, without consultation of the Ranking
Minority Member, in violation of section 3 of
House Resolution 660, unilaterally trans-
mitted additional records and other mate-
rials to the Committee on the Judiciary;
Whereas Chairman Schiff compelled the
production of documents from AT&T and
Verizon and, in violation of clause 2(k)(6) of
rule XI of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives, publicly used these documents
to smear the personal attorneys of the Presi-
dent, a journalist, and to create a false nar-
rative about a sitting Member of Congress
and current and former congressional staff;
Whereas on multiple occasions in both
closed-door depositions and public hearings,
Chairman Schiff abused his power as chair
by unilaterally restricting Republican lines
of questions and supporting witnesses’ at-
tempts to evade answering Republicans’ [or
‘‘the minority’s’’] questions by directing wit-
nesses not to answer certain questions from
Republican Members and staff;
Whereas on multiple occasions in both
closed-door depositions and public hearings,
Chairman Schiff abused his power as chair
by failing to follow proper parliamentary
procedure, failing to recognize Members who
wished to raise valid points of order, and re-
peatedly interrupting Republican Members
and staff when they controlled the time;
Whereas at the House Judiciary Commit-
tee’s first hearing pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 660, on December 4, 2019, Chairman Nad-
ler was furnished with a request for a minor-
ity day of hearings, pursuant to clause 2(j)(1)
of rule XI of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives, signed by all Republican Mem-
bers of the Committee;
Whereas subsequent to receiving the re-
quest for an additional day of hearings by
members of the minority party, Chairman
Nadler refused to schedule such hearings;
Whereas Ranking Minority Member Collins
furnished Chairman Nadler with a letter re-
minding him of his obligation to schedule a
minority day of hearings, as requested by
members of the minority party, and Chair-
man Nadler ignored the letter and failed to
respond;
Whereas Chairman Nadler repeatedly mis-
stated the rules, misguiding members of the
Committee and the American people, and re-
fused to rule properly on members’ points of
order concerning the requested minority
hearing day;
Whereas Chairman Nadler refused to con-
sider the scheduling of the minority hearing
day during a committee meeting until the
markup of articles of impeachment;
Whereas in place of finding common
ground with the minority, Chairman Schiff
and Chairman Nadler have constantly dis-
regarded the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives and ignored the fundamental
rights of the minority; and
Whereas Chairman Schiff’s and Chairman
Nadler’s actions and abuses of power as
chairmen of the Permanent Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence and the Committee on
the Judiciary have willfully trampled on the
rights of the minority in violation of the
Rules of the House of Representatives and
brought dishonor and discredit upon the
House of Representatives: Now, therefore, be
it
Resolved, That—
(1) the House of Representatives strongly
condemns Chairman Adam B. Schiff for re-
peated and blatant abuse of power in a way
that is not befitting an elected Member of
the House of Representatives nor his posi-
tion as Chairman; and
(2) the House of Representatives strongly
condemns the manner in which Chairman

H12116 December 18, 2019
POINT OF ORDER
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I
raise a point of order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Louisiana will state his
point of order.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I
raise this point of order for failure to
disclose the waiver of clause 2(j)(1) of
rule XI, pursuant to clause 6(g) of rule
XIII, which requires the Rules Com-
mittee to specify in their report any
waiver of a point of order against a
measure under consideration.
Madam Speaker, this underlying res-
olution violates clause 2(j)(1) of rule
XI, which entitles the minority of the
committee to have the ability to call
witnesses to testify during at least one
day of a hearing on any given measure.
This was not afforded to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary minority
members during consideration of the
Articles of Impeachment, despite nu-
merous requests by a majority of the
minority members.
Therefore, I raise a point of order
against consideration of the rule and
the underlying resolution for the viola-
tion of minority rights and the denial
of this evidence to be put into the
RECORD and for this hearing, which the
House rules require, which was not
complied with and was denied.
Madam Speaker, I urge the enforce-
ment of this rule.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Louisiana seeks to raise a
point of order against House Resolu-
tion 767 on the grounds that the report
accompanying the resolution fails to
specify a waiver of a particular point of
order and is thus in violation of clause
6(g) of rule XIII.
The gentleman is stating a matter
for debate rather than a proper point of
order. Clause 6(g) of rule XIII is merely
informational on any specified waivers
‘‘to the maximum extent possible.’’
As elucidated by Chairman Solomon
in the legislative history accom-
panying the adoption of this rule in the
104th Congress, any ‘‘failure of the
Rules Committee to specify waivers in
a rule would not give rise to a point of
order against a special rule that waives
all points of order.’’
The Chair would therefore advise the
gentleman that he is not stating a
proper point of order.
The gentleman from Massachusetts
is recognized for 1 hour.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for
the purpose of debate only, I yield the
customary 30 minutes to the distin-
guished gentleman from Oklahoma
(Mr. COLE), my good friend, pending
which I yield myself such time as I
may consume. During consideration of
this resolution, all time yielded is for
the purpose of debate only.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts?
There was no objection.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, on
Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and
reported a closed rule for House Reso-
lution 767, providing for consideration
of H. Res. 755, impeaching Donald John
Trump, President of the United States,
for high crimes and misdemeanors.
The rule provides 6 hours of debate
equally divided and controlled by the
chair and ranking minority member of
the Committee on the Judiciary or
their designees. The rule provides that
the question of adoption of the resolu-
tion shall be divided between two arti-
cles. The rule limits access to the
House floor. It provides, at any time
after adoption of H. Res. 755, for con-
sideration of a resolution appointing
and authorizing managers for the im-
peachment trial, if offered by the chair
of the Committee on the Judiciary, de-
batable for 10 minutes.
No resolution incidental to impeach-
ment relating to H. Res. 755 shall be
privileged during the remainder of the
116th Congress. Finally, the rule pro-
vides that the chair of the Committee
on the Judiciary may insert explana-
tory material in the CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD.
Madam Speaker, 232 years ago, as he
walked out of the Constitutional Con-
vention in Philadelphia, Benjamin
Franklin stated that the Founders had
just created ‘‘a republic, if you can
keep it.’’ He understood that nothing
was preordained, that our Nation
would continue to be shaped decision-
by-decision, vote-by-vote, not by some
other leaders in some other time but
day in and day out, both through the
regular work of government and during
historic moments like the one we face
today.
Our Founders crafted the fundamen-
tals of government to guide us, pas-
sages like Article I, Section 2 of the
Constitution, giving this Chamber the
sole power of impeachment. But no-
where does it list exactly what con-
stitutes a high crime or misdemeanor.
In their wisdom, the Founders under-
stood they could not anticipate what
the future would bring. They gave sub-
sequent generations—us—the chance to
decide precisely what our government
would become, to decide with each
passing day what a nation defined by
the rule of law is willing to tolerate.
That is what brings us here today, to
decide nearly two-and-a-half centuries
later whether the United States is still
a nation where no one is above the law
or whether America becomes a land
run by those who act more like kings
or queens, as if the law doesn’t apply to
them.
Yes, Madam Speaker, this really is
that serious.
Over the past several months, the
House of Representatives has been con-
ducting an impeachment inquiry into
the 45th President of the United
States, Donald John Trump.
Our inquiry is simply to answer the
following question: Did President
Trump and his top advisers corruptly
withhold official government actions
to obtain an improper advantage in the
next election?
We now know, through the hard work
of our investigative committees, and
because of the President’s own admis-
sion, that the answer to that question
is yes. The President withheld congres-
sionally approved military aid to
Ukraine, a country under siege, not to
fight corruption but to extract a per-
sonal political favor. President Trump
refused to meet with Ukraine’s Presi-
dent in the White House until he com-
pleted this scheme.
All the while, leaders in Russia, the
very nation holding a large part of
Ukraine hostage, the very nation that
interfered with our elections, had an-
other meeting in the Oval Office just
last week.
The President of the United States
endangered our national security. The
President undermined our democracy.
And the President, a successor to the
same office as George Washington and
Abraham Lincoln, betrayed his oath to
preserve, protect, and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States.
These aren’t opinions. These are
uncontested facts.
Now, I have read the details of the
July 25 phone call with President
Zelensky, where President Trump said:
‘‘I would like you to do us a favor,
though.’’ I have seen the televised
press conference where his Chief of
Staff openly admitted to this deal and
told the Nation to ‘‘just get over it.’’
Hours and hours of depositions by the
Committee on Intelligence, Committee
on Oversight and Reform, and Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs have been
conducted where witnesses outlined the
President’s direct involvement in this
scheme.
The evidence is as clear as it is over-
whelming. If a President undermining
our national security and using the
Federal Government for his own self-
ish, personal gain is not impeachable
conduct, then, Madam Speaker, I don’t
know what is.
I have heard some on the other side
suggest this process is about over-
turning an election. That is absurd.
This is about protecting our democ-
racy.
These facts are beyond dispute. The
only question now is whether we are
willing to tolerate such conduct, not
just today by President Trump but,
furthermore, by any President of either
party. To not act would set a dan-
gerous precedent, not just for this
President, but for every future Presi-
dent.
Madam Speaker, 11 months ago,
many of us took an oath right here in
this Chamber. I have had the privilege
to take that oath 12 times now, and I
believe it is not just for show. It is a
contract between each of us and the
people we represent to place the na-
tional interest above partisan interests
and to preserve those laws that make
our country unique. We cannot rec-
oncile the President’s abuse of power

and obstruction of Congress with the
oath of office that we took.
Madam Speaker, we are being tested
on something greater than our ability
to toe a party line, something more
than our ability to score the next great
television sound bite. This is a democ-
racy-defining moment.
History will judge us by whether we
keep intact that fragile republic hand-
ed down to us by our forebearers more
than 200 years ago or whether we allow
it to be changed forever. For the sake
of our country’s future, I hope, and I
pray, that my colleagues will make the
right decision.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Massachusetts
(Mr. MCGOVERN), my good friend, for
yielding me the customary 30 minutes,
and I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Madam Speaker, today is a very sad
day for all of us—for me personally, for
the Rules Committee, for the entire
House of Representatives, and, most
importantly, for the American people.
For the second time in my life, the
House of Representatives will be voting
to impeach a President of the United
States. But unlike in 1998, the decision
to have this vote is not the result of a
bipartisan process nor an open or fair
process. Instead, it is going to be a
deeply partisan vote, coming at the end
of an unfair and rushed process pre-
scribed solely by Democrats to ensure
a predetermined result.
b 1015
Impeachment of a President is one of
the most consequential acts the House
of Representatives can undertake, and
it should only be done after the fullest
and most careful consideration.
Yet, today, after a truncated inves-
tigation that denied the President due
process and cherry-picked evidence and
witness testimony to fit their nar-
rative and trampled on Republicans’
minority rights, Democrats in the
House are pressing forward with a par-
tisan impeachment vote.
Doing so contradicts Speaker
PELOSI’s own words back in March of
this year when she said that an ‘‘im-
peachment is so divisive to the country
that unless there’s something so com-
pelling and overwhelming and bipar-
tisan, I don’t think we should go down
that path, because it divides the coun-
try.’’
But if we are really being honest,
Democrats have been searching for a
reason to impeach President Trump
since the day he was elected. In Decem-
ber of 2017, a current member of the
majority forced a vote to impeach the
President; and even then, long before
there was even an impeachment inves-
tigation, 58 Democrats voted to im-
peach the President.
Those Members have only grown
since then, to the point where the ma-
jority is now pushing forward with a
final vote on impeachment, heedless of
where it takes the country and regard-
less of whether or not they have proven
their case.
If my colleagues in the majority be-
lieve they have proven their case, let
me be clear: They have not. The entire
premise of these Articles of Impeach-
ment rests on a pause placed on
Ukrainian security assistance, a pause
of 55 days.
The majority has spun creative nar-
ratives as to the meaning and the mo-
tive of this pause, alleging the Presi-
dent demanded a ‘‘quid pro quo,’’ but
with no factual evidence to back it up.
Security aid to Ukraine was released.
The administration did so without
Ukraine ever initiating an investiga-
tion into anyone or anything.
It is even more startling to me that
the majority wants to move forward
with this resolution given how substan-
tially flawed and procedurally defec-
tive the entire process has been.
The Judiciary Committee, which
drafted these Articles of Impeachment,
engaged in an abbreviated process,
hearing from no witnesses with first-
hand knowledge of the events in ques-
tion. They did not conduct their own
investigation and only held two hear-
ings on this topic before drafting the
articles, one with staff and one with
constitutional law scholars. That is
hardly the type of lengthy and serious
consideration a topic as grave as im-
peachment demands.
The committee actually charged with
an impeachment investigation was the
Permanent Select Committee on Intel-
ligence, not the Judiciary Committee,
but that committee, too, followed a
primarily closed process. Republicans
were denied the right to call witnesses
or subpoena documents, and the Presi-
dent was denied the right to represen-
tation in the committee’s hearings.
Without respecting minority rights
and without respecting due process
rights of the President, how can any-
one consider this a fair process?
Madam Speaker, it gets worse. The
Articles of Impeachment we are consid-
ering today are based on the Schiff re-
port, the final document produced by
the Intelligence Committee and trans-
mitted to the Judiciary Committee.
But the Schiff report includes unsub-
stantiated allegations. It includes, in
some cases, news reports as the only
evidence supporting so-called factual
assertions, and it includes at least 54
different hearsay statements as asser-
tions of evidence without any firsthand
information from witnesses to corrobo-
rate those statements.
The author of the report, Chairman
SCHIFF, was never questioned by the
Judiciary Committee, and he refused to
sit for questions or to explain how his
committee conducted its investigation.
In fact, during the staff presentation of
evidence at the Judiciary Committee,
Ranking Member COLLINS asked how
the investigation was conducted that
resulted in the drafting of the Schiff
report, but he never received an an-
swer.
During the Rules Committee consid-
eration of H. Res. 755, there were nu-
merous times when the members on
both sides of the aisle posed questions
to our witnesses, questions they could
not answer because they sit on the Ju-
diciary Committee and were not the
author of the report that brought
about H. Res. 755.
The author has never appeared before
members of the minority to explain a
single thing in the report or to provide
factual information supporting the
many assertions it contains.
Madam Speaker, this is no way to go
about impeaching the President of the
United States. The articles before us
are based on very limited information.
They are based on hearsay, on news re-
ports, and on other unsupported allega-
tions. They are based on a report writ-
ten by a Member of Congress who re-
fused to answer questions about it; and
I do not believe the allegations, which
are subject to interpretation, actually
rise to the level of an impeachable of-
fense.
To make matters worse, when Repub-
licans attempted to exercise one of
their rights under House rules, they
were shut down by Chairman NADLER.
Under clause 2(j)(1) of rule XI, the mi-
nority is allowed to demand a minority
hearing day. On December 4, the Re-
publicans on the Judiciary Committee
properly exercised that right and
transmitted a demand to Chairman
NADLER for a hearing day at which the
minority could call their own wit-
nesses.
To be clear, Madam Speaker, a mi-
nority hearing day is not subject to the
chair’s discretion. It is a right, and Re-
publicans on the Judiciary Committee
properly demanded the exercise of that
right; yet, Chairman NADLER declined
to allow a minority hearing day to be
held before the voting of these articles.
I think we can all agree that it would
have been better for the institution
and for the American people to allow
all voices to be heard and all witnesses
to be questioned before proceeding to a
vote on something this consequential;
yet, the majority trampled on that
right.
But I suppose I should not be sur-
prised by any of this. When the House
passed H. Res. 660, the resolution set-
ting up the official impeachment in-
quiry less than 2 months ago, I warned
the House that what the majority was
doing was setting up a closed, unfair
process that could only have one out-
come. Today, we are seeing the end re-
sult of this closed and unfair process: a
quick rush to judgment forced through
not one, but two committees in short
order, with minority rights trampled,
witnesses left unquestioned, and due
process ignored.
It is also disappointing that Members
are not being given more time to de-
bate this issue on the floor.
Last night at the Rules Committee, I
offered an amendment to double the
amount of floor time debate from 6 to
12 hours. This would have allowed for

roughly the same amount of debate
time used in the Clinton impeachment,
and it would have been ensured that all
Members could have the opportunity to
speak on the floor. Unfortunately, that
amendment was not accepted.
While I know my friend, Chairman
MCGOVERN, did the best he could, I do
think it is ironic that, when all is said
and done, the 13 members of the Rules
Committee spent more time discussing
H. Res. 755 in committee yesterday
than we will spend debating it on the
House floor for every Member today. I
think that is a disservice to the Mem-
bers of this body and to the American
people.
Madam Speaker, we deserve better
than the flawed process that led to this
flawed outcome. The House of Rep-
resentatives deserves better than that.
The President certainly deserves better
than that. More importantly, the
American people deserve better than
what we are doing here today.
I oppose proceeding any further; I op-
pose the rule; I oppose this limited and
unfair process; and I certainly oppose
impeaching the President of the United
States. I urge opposition to the rule,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
include in the RECORD a letter that I
sent with regard to the Members’ day.
COMMITTEE ON RULES
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Washington, DC, December 16, 2019.
Hon. TOM COLE,
Ranking Republican,
House Committee on Rules, Washington, DC.
DEAR MR. COLE: Thank you for your letter
dated December 5, 2019, regarding a minority
day of hearings on the topic of ‘‘The Im-
peachment Inquiry into President Donald J.
Trump: Constitutional Grounds for Presi-
dential Impeachment.’’ I know that it comes
from a place of respect for this institution
and for the gravity of the matters at hand,
and I share your desire to ensure that this
process is in compliance with the House
rules.
You are correct that it is incumbent on
committee chairmen to schedule such a
hearing, following a request of the minority
members of the Committee pursuant to
clause 20(j)(1) of rule XI. After a careful re-
view of the legislative history of the rule,
the plain text of the rule, and Chairman
Nadler’s December 12, 2019, ruling, I have
concluded that Chairman Nadler has not vio-
lated either the spirit or the letter of the
rule.
At the hearing in question, the Judiciary
Committee minority requested and received
a witness. The legislative history of clause
20(j)(1) of rule XI makes clear that the intent
was to ensure the minority position is rep-
resented in hearings, codifying the existing
practice of honoring witness requests. The
Joint Committee on the Organization of Con-
gress proposed this change in their 1966 final
recommendations, suggesting that a min-
imum safeguard be established for ‘‘those in-
frequent instances when witnesses rep-
resenting the minority position are not al-
lotted time.’’ The Rules Committee report
on the Legislative Reorganization Act of
1970, which first created the rule, stated that
‘‘by custom, committees ordinarily honor re-
quests from their minority party members to
call certain witnesses. Section 114(b) will
make this a matter of right.’’
Consistent with this original purpose, the
rule has largely been used as leverage for the
minority to ensure they are not shut out of
hearings. It is standard practice across com-
mittees for the minority to negotiate adding
minority witnesses to the main panels rather
than holding a minority day—not to add wit-
nesses in addition to holding a minority day.
In the rare instance the minority is shut out,
the rule provides them a guarantee that the
committee will hear from their side on the
topic at hand.
The Rules Committee report specifies that
in creating this right, ‘‘We do not look upon
this as an authorization for delaying tactics
but rather as good legislative practice.’’ In
this instance, Chairman Nadler has complied
with the spirit of this good legislative prac-
tice as well as following modern committee
practice. He accommodated the Judiciary
Committee minority’s request to place Pro-
fessor Jonathan Turley on the main witness
panel, ensuring minority views on the con-
stitutional ground for presidential impeach-
ment were represented.
Chairman Nadler has also followed the let-
ter of the rule by agreeing to work with the
minority to schedule a hearing. According to
clause 20(j)(1) of rule XI, ‘‘Whenever a hear-
ing is conducted by a committee on a meas-
ure or matter, the minority members of the
committee shall be entitled, upon request to
the chair by a majority of them before the
completion of the hearing, to call witnesses
selected by the minority to testify with re-
spect to that measure or matter during at
least one day of hearing thereon.’’
As Chairman Nadler correctly stated in his
ruling, ‘‘the House rule does not require
[him] to schedule a hearing on a particular
day, nor does it require [him] to schedule the
hearing as a condition precedent to taking
any specific legislative action.’’ No prece-
dent exists requiring a minority day of hear-
ings to be scheduled before a matter is re-
ported out of committee. In fact, very little
precedent exists regarding this rule at all,
because it is typically used as a negotiating
tool and rarely invoked in practice.
The recent practice of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, in particular, has not been to delay
business in order to schedule a minority day
hearing. In his ruling, Chairman Nadler cited
a 2018 example in which he and other mem-
bers properly requested a minority day hear-
ing and never received a response to their re-
quest from then-Chairman Goodlatte, let
alone a hearing. That was a clear violation
of clause 2(j)(1) of rule XI. In this case, how-
ever, Chairman Nadler has appropriately
said that he will work with the minority to
schedule their hearing.
Chairman Nadler neither shut the minor-
ity out of the hearing on the constitutional
grounds of impeachment, nor did he refuse to
schedule a hearing. The process we set up
through H. Res. 660 even ensured that the
President and his counsel could participate
in the Judiciary Committee, though they
chose not to avail themselves of that right.
Impeachment is a solemn responsibility,
and I appreciate your concern that we under-
take the process in accordance with the
House rules. In these partisan times, I am
truly grateful for the professional and colle-
gial manner in which members of this com-
mittee conduct themselves. The fact that we
are able to work together even when we
sometimes disagree on the specifics gives me
hope for this institution.
Sincerely,
JAMES P. MCGOVERN,
Chairman, House Committee on Rules.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself 30 seconds.
I think it is important to correct the
RECORD that there were zero points of
order that lie against H. Res. 755.
We are here to talk about the Presi-
dent’s behavior, and that is what I
think we all should be focused on, not
just process. But I want to just say
that I am proud of the process.
Democrats and Republicans have had
equal opportunity to participate in the
months-long impeachment inquiry.
Members of both parties have been in-
volved at every stage of this process,
from sitting in and asking questions in
closed-door depositions to questioning
witnesses in open hearings.
The committees took more than 100
hours of deposition testimony from 17
witnesses and held seven public hear-
ings, which included Republican-re-
quested witnesses. They produced a 300-
page public report that laid out their
findings of evidence.
The Judiciary Committee then took
that report and conducted two public
hearings evaluating the evidence and
the legal standard for impeachment be-
fore reporting out the two articles.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself an additional 15 seconds.
President Trump was given the op-
portunity to participate in the Judici-
ary Committee’s review of the evidence
presented against him. He chose not to
participate. And President Trump, to
date, has not provided any exculpatory
evidence but, instead, has blocked nu-
merous witnesses from testifying about
his actions.
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to
the gentleman from South Carolina
(Mr. CLYBURN), the majority whip.
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I
rise today feeling the full weight of my
duty, as a Member of this august body,
reflecting upon our oath of office to
support and defend the Constitution
against all enemies, foreign and domes-
tic. It is my sincere belief that, under
the circumstances that bring us here
today, there is only one path for us to
take to fulfill that oath.
Thomas Paine, in the first of his se-
ries of pamphlets entitled ‘‘The Amer-
ican Crisis,’’ published 243 years ago to-
morrow, intoned that ‘‘these are the
times that try men’s souls. The sum-
mer soldier and sunshine patriot will,
in this crisis, shrink from the service
of their country; but he that stands by
it now, deserves the love and thanks of
man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is
not easily conquered.’’
These words were written at a time
when our Founders were rebelling
against the tyrannical rule of the Brit-
ish monarchy. Today, we have a Presi-
dent who seems to believe he is a king
or above the law. Paine warned us that
‘‘so unlimited a power can belong only
to God Almighty.’’
My faith leads me to take very seri-
ously the final words of our oath to
faithfully discharge the duties of the
office, ‘‘so help me God.’’
Madam Speaker, 3 days ago, I joined
with a bipartisan delegation of our col-
leagues celebrating the 75th anniver-
sary of the Battle of the Bulge. We laid

wreaths at the memorials of Generals
George Patton and Anthony McAuliffe.
We visited foxholes that were occupied
by some brave soldiers who fought in
some of the worst winter weather ever
visited upon a battlefield, and we vis-
ited the Luxembourg American Ceme-
tery, the final resting place of thou-
sands of them and General George Pat-
ton.
They were not summer soldiers in
their efforts 75 years ago to preserve
the Republic, and we must not be sun-
shine patriots today in our efforts to
protect the Constitution upon which
this great Republic stands. While our
fight is not in the trenches or battle-
fields but in the Hallowed Halls of this
Congress, our duty is no less patriotic.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself 15 seconds just to respond to my
friend.
President Trump, for the Record, was
not provided the opportunity to chal-
lenge the facts and still has not re-
ceived the materials from the Judici-
ary Committee, as required by H. Res.
660, another example of why this isn’t a
fair process.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY),
the distinguished chairman of the Re-
publican Conference, for the purpose of
a unanimous consent request.
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent to amend House
Resolution 767 to provide for voting by
a manual call of the roll so the Amer-
ican people can see precisely who is
supporting the impeachment of a duly-
elected President.
Members should be required to stand
and identify themselves openly and on
camera on the question of adoption of
these Articles of Impeachment.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time
has been yielded for the purpose of de-
bate only by the gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts.
Does the gentleman from Massachu-
setts yield for this unanimous consent
request?
Mr. MCGOVERN. I do not.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts does not
yield; therefore, the unanimous con-
sent request cannot be entertained.
b 1030
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield to
the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.
SMITH), my good friend and the distin-
guished secretary of the Republican
Conference for the purpose of a unani-
mous consent request.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to
amend House Resolution 767 to provide
for 12 hours of debate equally divided
by the majority and the minority,
which would allow each Member of the
House at least 12⁄3 minutes of debate, as
opposed to currently 50 seconds. The
people’s representatives deserve the
right of more than 50 seconds to be
heard in this important matter.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time
has been yielded for the purpose of de-
bate by the gentleman from Massachu-
setts.
Does the gentleman from Massachu-
setts yield for this unanimous consent
request?
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
do not.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. There-
fore, this unanimous consent request
cannot be entertained.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 4
minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. BURGESS), my good friend, a dis-
tinguished member of both the Energy
and Commerce Committee and the
House Rules Committee.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, yesterday the Rules
Committee spent 8 hours considering
whether to bring H. Res. 755, the Arti-
cles of Impeachment, to the House
floor. Given the four-to-nine ratio of
Republicans to Democrats on the com-
mittee, it is no surprise that we are
now considering the articles before us.
Despite robust debate on the so-
called facts derived from the impeach-
ment investigation and the process by
which they were obtained, Democrats
and Republicans remain in opposition
to each other on our conclusions.
As outlined yesterday by Ranking
Member COLLINS and several members
of the Rules Committee through direct
quotes, some Democrats have been
seeking President Trump’s impeach-
ment since his inauguration. The rush
to impeach first and solidify the case
second threatens the credibility of the
process and threatens the credibility of
the body engaged, this very House of
Representatives.
In fact, it has been quoted before and
it will be quoted again today, I suspect,
Chairman NADLER recognized the grav-
ity of impeachment when he stated in
December of 1998, ‘‘The effect of im-
peachment is to overturn the popular
will of the voters as expressed in a na-
tional election. There must never be a
narrowly voted impeachment or an im-
peachment substantially supported by
one of our major political parties and
largely opposed by the other. Such an
impeachment would lack legitimacy,
would produce divisiveness and bitter-
ness in our politics for years to come.
And will call into question the very le-
gitimacy of our political institutions.’’
On October 31, this House voted to
authorize the official impeachment in-
vestigation in H. Res. 660. The process
outlined in H. Res. 660 did not include
the robust minority protections af-
forded the minority party in previous
impeachment investigations. Even
more concerning, Chairman NADLER
and Chairman SCHIFF refused to com-
ply with the very rules of the House in
granting access to committee records
for members in scheduling a minority
hearing in a reasonable amount of
time, thus preventing the American
people from being equally represented
in the process.
Refusing to allow members to access
their own records, these are records of
the Members of the House of Rep-
resentatives, and we were not allowed
to access these records obtained down
in secret under armed guard in the In-
telligence Committee, but it is re-
quired under section 2(e) of rule XI, and
they have denied members the ability
to do their job.
The Judiciary Committee did not
hear testimony from even one fact wit-
ness, not even one, after they received
a deluge of materials from the Intel-
ligence Committee. This reversal of re-
sponsibility is indeed unprecedented.
But turning to the case upon which
the argument is based, we had a whis-
tleblower, not a fact witness, a whistle-
blower who never appeared before any
Member of Congress that we know of, a
whistleblower complaint concerning a
congratulatory call between President
Trump and President Zelensky of
Ukraine.
The whistleblower is known to have
had contact with Chairman SCHIFF’s
staff while Republicans were denied
any contact. The whistleblower com-
plaint is not based on first-hand knowl-
edge, and the call transcript that was
to support impeachment reveals noth-
ing more than a congratulatory phone
call.
A request for investigations as to
how American foreign aid will be spent
does not equal soliciting election inter-
ference. The evidence brought before us
does not amount to a high crime; in-
deed, it does not amount to any crime.
Democrats claim that we must pro-
tect the integrity of our election. If
you really cared, then I have to ask,
what are we missing while we have
been focused on impeachment? We tied
up the Intelligence Committee. We tied
up the Judiciary Committee. And, oh,
by the way, the Ways and Means Com-
mittee had to give up their room. They
couldn’t even meet while you were
doing all of this.
This impeachment investigation is
being painted as a protection against
future interference, when in reality
President Trump’s request looks back
at the 2016 election. Russia is the win-
ner in this exchange because they have
disrupted the process.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker,
the gentleman is passionate about
records. I should remind him that we
have gotten no records from this White
House, not a single document.
At this time I yield 11⁄2 minutes to
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.
SHALALA), a distinguished member of
the Rules Committee.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
come to impeachment with deep sad-
ness. The facts of this case are painful
and indisputable. We know that the
President illegally held up congression-
ally appropriated aid to Ukraine. We
know that he conditioned the release of
this aid on Ukrainian President
Zelensky’s opening an investigation
based on a debunked conspiracy theory
about his political rival and foreign in-
terference in the 2016 election.

We also know that the President has
actively blocked congressional at-
tempts to determine the extent of his
misconduct by ordering executive
branch officials to defy subpoenas and
withhold information.
Despite the unprecedented obstruc-
tion from the President, the evidence
in this case is powerful enough that to
delay this vote any further would risk
interference in the 2020 election and
the permanent erosion of our system of
checks and balances.
Madam Speaker, this is not a matter
of politics. This is a matter of pro-
tecting the integrity of our democracy
for the next generation.
As we labor to pass on to future gen-
erations many of the great hallmarks
of our society, we must also work with
active stewardship and vigilance to
pass on a vibrant and functional de-
mocracy.
If we don’t do our duty to protect the
Constitution, the republic that we
hand to our children will be less vi-
brant. If we do not do our duty to pro-
tect the Constitution, the republic that
we hand to our children will be less re-
silient and less effective than the sys-
tem that we were so fortunate to in-
herit.
Democracy is fragile. Its survival depends
on the strength and courage we display in
maintaining it.
But this fragility is also a strength. It re-
quires our public servants to put our nation’s
interests ahead of their own and to hold each
other accountable to the high standards de-
mocracy demands.
That’s why we take an oath to defend the
Constitution. If protecting the Constitution were
trivial, we wouldn’t have to take an oath.
For over 200 years, honesty and vigilance
have won out as generations of public serv-
ants have adhered to their oaths of office and
met the standards of service that our democ-
racy demands.
We cannot let this legacy die on our watch.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 4
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ari-
zona (Mrs. LESKO), my very good friend
and fellow member of the Rules Com-
mittee and member of the Judiciary
Committee.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I
thank Mr. COLE for yielding me the
time.
Madam Speaker, God takes us on
journeys in our life, and about 30 years
ago I was married to an abusive ex-hus-
band. When I finally left him, there
were times in my life when I had no
money and no place to live.
And I tell you what, I never dreamed
in a million years that I would be
standing here today as a Congress-
woman in the United States House of
Representatives.
And I tell you what, I never would
have believed that I would be standing
here talking about impeachment of a
President of the United States.
I serve on the Judiciary Committee. I
also serve on the Rules Committee. I
have spent hours and hours reading
transcripts, looking at documents,
hearing testimony, and I can tell you
one thing: I believe this is the most un-
fair, politically biased, rigged process
that I have seen in my entire life.
Here are the facts: There is no proof,
none, that the President has com-
mitted an impeachable offense. Not one
of the Democrat witnesses was able to
establish that the President committed
bribery, treason, or high crimes and
misdemeanors as required in the U.S.
Constitution.
And as I have said before, the Demo-
crats are really undermining their own
argument here because 17 out of the 24
Democrat members on the Judiciary
Committee voted here on this floor to
put forward, move forward Articles of
Impeachment on July 17 of this year
before President Trump’s call even
took place. And five out of the nine
Rules Committee members that are
Democrats did the same thing.
So if your argument is that this
phone call is the main reason for this
impeachable offense, why did you vote
for impeachment, moving impeach-
ment forward before the call even took
place?
The process has been rigged from the
start. Other Members have told you.
Never in the history of the United
States have we had an impeachment
that has gone through the Intelligence
Committee in closed-door hearings
where a Member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, myself, wasn’t even able to ask
one single question of a fact witness.
The whole thing has been rigged, been
unfair.
In the process that you had set forth
you made sure that the President
didn’t have any right to have his coun-
sel there until Judiciary, but by then it
was too late. It was too late because
there were no fact witnesses allowed in
Judiciary. So I couldn’t even ask a
question, nor could the President.
This is the most partisan impeach-
ment in the history of the United
States. Not one Republican voted for it
in the Judiciary Committee, not one
Republican voted for it in the Rules
Committee, and not one Republican, I
don’t think, is going to vote for it here
today.
Madam Speaker, this is a sad day. I
believe the Democrats are tearing this
country apart. They are tearing fami-
lies apart.
May God continue to bless all of you.
May God continue to bless the Presi-
dent of the United States. And may
God continue to bless our great Nation.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, if
Republicans want to defend the Presi-
dent’s indefensible behavior, they can
do so, but I would urge my colleagues
to stand up for the Constitution and to
stand up for this country and our de-
mocracy.
I now yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr.
DESAULNIER), a distinguished member
of the Rules Committee.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding, and
I thank the leadership of the Rules
Committee, Mr. MCGOVERN and Mr.
COLE, for our civility last night. Al-
though it was a long hearing and we
are very much in disagreement, I felt
proud to be part of that hearing, and I
really want to recognize both the rank-
ing member and the chair.
The previous speaker is part of that
Rules Committee, and I would just say
that the passion that she demonstrated
in her comments, I can’t say how much
I completely disagree with her, which
is a statement on the environment we
find ourselves in, and I, unfortunately,
agree with some of her comments, but
where the responsibility is I would put
at the White House and the President.
He is the divisive one. He is not trying
to heal our wounds.
The reality and urgency of this mo-
ment cannot be more consequential to
the American democracy. This is not a
hypothetical. President Trump vio-
lated the law and solicited foreign in-
terference in our election. At the same
time, objective experts have over-
whelming evidence that Russia inter-
fered in the 2016 election and is ac-
tively engaged in undermining the 2020
elections.
Our vote today and the Senate’s ac-
tions on impeachment have very real
long-term consequences for American
democracy. Where do we go from here
if the Senate does not remove him? The
President has a pattern of escalating
behavior. The day before the special
counsel testified to Congress that the
Russian Government interfered in our
election in sweeping and systemic fash-
ion, President Trump made this call.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield an additional 15 seconds to the
gentleman from California.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Two days before
that, the President says that Article II
of the Constitution says that he can do
whatever he wants.
As Washington warned in his farewell
address, foreign interference tampers
with domestic factions and misleads
public opinion. We must honor the Na-
tion that our Founders envisioned and
impeach this president for violating
the law and betraying the American
people.

Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. BYRNE), my very good
friend, a distinguished member of the
Armed Services Committee and a
former member of the Rules Com-
mittee.
Mr. BYRNE. Madam Speaker, I rise
in strong opposition to the rule and the
underlying resolution to impeach
President Trump.
When the Framers granted the House
the power to impeach, they feared that
it would be abused.
Today, those fears are realized.
In record speed, this majority has as-
sembled hearsay, speculation, and pre-
sumptions for the purpose of over-
turning the 2016 election.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H12121
December 18, 2019
We are not here today, days before
Christmas, because the majority has
assembled a case against President
Trump. No. We are here today because
the Democrat majority believes get-
ting impeachment done now will pro-
vide their vulnerable Members time to
distance themselves from their vote.
But I assure you, Madam Speaker,
the American people are watching.
Many of my colleagues have, from
day one, rejected the people’s choice of
President Trump, but another Presi-
dent will come along more to the ma-
jority’s liking. Our actions here today
will be remembered and will set the
standard.
The second Article of Impeachment
seeks to remove President Trump for
failure to produce certain requested
witnesses and documents, but as the
majority knows, every President in
history has asserted executive privi-
lege.
The House has a legal avenue to chal-
lenge the President: the courts. But
the majority has skipped this step,
showing that this is about impeach-
ment as fast as possible, however pos-
sible.
Most of my friends on the other side
of the aisle had no problem backing
President Obama when he stonewalled
the House for years to block our quest
to find out the truth in the Fast and
Furious investigation. That is why I
filed an amendment to the resolution,
rejected by the Rules Committee, say-
ing, based upon the Democratic major-
ity standard, they should have written
Articles of Impeachment against Presi-
dent Obama and Eric Holder.
I wish my colleagues would think
about the standard being set. I predict
that they will very soon regret it.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from California (Mrs. TORRES), a distin-
guished member of the Rules Com-
mittee.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam
Speaker, the facts are clear. To quote
the USA Today editorial board:
‘‘Trump used your tax dollars to shake
down a vulnerable foreign government
to interfere in a U.S. election for his
personal benefit.’’
The rule of law is what gives our
great country its strength.
The rule of law is what separates us
from Third World countries, where dic-
tators reign for decades on end.
The rule of law is what makes us the
envy of the world, the place that other
countries look to as they grow their
own democracies.
It is the rule of law that brings us
here today.
We never want to see the rule of law
deteriorate or rampant corruption take
hold.
We never want to see the day when
future generations flee for refuge in an-
other country, the way that others are
seeking refuge on our southern border
right now.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ American values
and our Constitution are worth fight-
ing for.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from Indi-
ana (Mrs. WALORSKI), my very good
friend, also a distinguished member of
the Ways and Means Committee.
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in direct opposition to this
rule and in opposition to the divisive
partisanship that is on display right
now in this House of Representatives.
It is no secret Democrats have want-
ed to impeach President Trump from
day one, regardless of any fact.
They knew the result they wanted;
they just needed time to figure out how
to get there.
So they began their impeachment in-
quiry behind closed doors, selective
leaks instead of transparency, no due
process.
Once they crafted their perfect nar-
rative, they moved on to public hear-
ings.
They hoped the American people
wouldn’t notice that they failed to un-
cover one piece of evidence to justify
impeachment.
They failed to make the case for this
drastic action, and yet here we are.
For the first time in history, a Presi-
dent is on the brink of being impeached
with the votes of one single party.
But let’s be clear about one thing:
This impeachment obsession is not
about accountability; it is not about
justice; it is not even about the Con-
stitution.
It is about pure partisan politics at
its worst, and you are watching it right
here.
The American people see right
through this today. They have seen the
rigged process; they have seen the lack
of transparency and the complete ab-
sence of any supporting evidence.
They know that Washington is bro-
ken. That is why they sent us here: to
fix it.
But instead, House Democrats are di-
viding the country and further shaking
the people’s trust in this Congress.
It is a sham impeachment. It has
been carried out at the expense of hard-
working Americans who just want us
to move forward.
Madam Speaker, this charade should
go no farther. We should stop wasting
time and focus on what keeps our Na-
tion moving forward: helping workers
and families thrive, protecting the
safety and security of our country.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote against the rule so we
can get back to work for the American
people.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
New Mexico (Mr. LUJÁN), the Assistant
Speaker.
Mr. LUJÁN. Madam Speaker, no one
came to Congress to impeach a Presi-
dent.
We came here to solve the mighty
issues that impact the lives of the con-
stituents we pledged to serve.
I am here because too many families
in my district still rely on water
trucked in from dozens of miles away.
I am here because too many New
Mexican children still go to school
hungry.
I am here because too many women
in New Mexico drive for hours to find a
doctor able to care for them.
But this moment has found us. We
have reached a point in time where our
love of country compels action, where
our duty to this republic mandates
that we do what is right.
The President’s behavior is so bla-
tantly wrong that ignoring his abuses
of power would be abdicating the oath
we made to protect this country and
uphold our Constitution.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment on the rule that the House shall
not proceed to consideration of the un-
derlying resolution until six conditions
are met: all evidence in the possession
of Chairman SCHIFF has been made
available to the Judiciary Committee;
that Chairman SCHIFF appear before
the Judiciary Committee to testify to
the report that he authored; that all
underlying unclassified evidence has
been made available to the public; mi-
nority members of the Judiciary Com-
mittee have received their right to a
minority hearing day; minority wit-
nesses requested by Ranking Member
NUNES and Ranking Member COLLINS
are called and allowed to be heard in
accordance with H. Res. 660; and sub-
poenas requested by Ranking Member
NUNES in the Intelligence Committee
are issued and enforced.
Madam Speaker, to be clear, my
amendment ensures that the majority
does not proceed without providing a
fair, equitable, and transparent proc-
ess, one that respects minority rights,
one that opens up the investigation to
all Members of the House, and one that
allows Republicans on the Judiciary
Committee to examine the most rel-
evant witnesses.
Perhaps most crucially, it will allow
all Members to fully consider the infor-
mation available to the committee
that actually conducted the impeach-
ment investigation, the Permanent Se-
lect Committee on Intelligence.
The process the House has followed
has been abysmal. It was a closed, un-
fair process that did not respect minor-
ity rights and did not give the Presi-
dent due process. But we can change
that today. If we defeat the previous
question, the House will only move for-
ward with a real, thorough, and ulti-
mately fair process that all Members
can be proud of. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on
the previous question.
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous
consent to insert the text of my
amendment in the RECORD, along with
extraneous material, immediately
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma?
There was no objection.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H12122 December 18, 2019
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Georgia
(Mr. HICE), my good friend.
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
The majority has thrown almost
every allegation imaginable against
this President, and yet these Articles
of Impeachment that have been sub-
mitted cannot name a single actual
crime.
After all the drama, the majority has
not found a single shred of evidence,
only second-, third-, fourth-hand infor-
mation, but the facts have remained
the same. The transcript speaks for
itself.
There was no quid pro quo. The
Ukrainian Government said multiple
times they felt no pressure whatsoever.
The aid ultimately came. And even
Speaker PELOSI said that this whole
thing would have compelling, over-
whelming, bipartisan support.
None of those things exist.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to stand against the rule and
the forthcoming Articles of Impeach-
ment. This is a disgrace and dangerous
to America, and I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.
CLARK).
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts.
Madam Speaker, to paraphrase one of
our founding mothers, Abigail Adams:
A people may let a President fall, yet still
remain a people, but if a President lets his
people slip from him, he is no longer a Presi-
dent.
Just as Abigail Adams warned, Don-
ald Trump has let the people slip from
him. He works for himself, not us.
He tried to extort a foreign govern-
ment into investigating a political
rival, and he has unlawfully withheld
witnesses and evidence.
If we want a democracy, today we
must stand for the rule of law.
A vote to impeach is a vote to remain
a government that is of, for, and by the
people.
It is a vote born of great fear for our
future, but also rooted in optimism:
that if we stand for the truth, for our
Constitution, we can continue to cre-
ate a country of liberty, justice, and
equality for all.
Mr. COLE. Might I inquire, Madam
Speaker, how much time we have re-
maining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oklahoma has 51⁄4 minutes
remaining. The gentleman from Massa-
chusetts has 131⁄4 minutes remaining.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. ZELDIN), my good friend.
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle
throughout this whole process, their
allies in the media, they like to say
that Republicans only want to talk
about process, not substance, even
though we continue to talk about sub-
stance as well.
They declare their facts are
uncontested. They just did it again.
So just to, maybe, recap a few for ev-
eryone watching at home, as well as
my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle, and hopefully they will listen:
President Zelensky says there was no
demand, no pressure, no quid pro quo.
Andriy Yermak said on December 10
that their whole story with regard to
the December 1 meeting with Ambas-
sador Sondland is completely refuted.
We heard from Ambassador Sondland
himself, who admitted that he heard
from President Trump that he didn’t
want any quid pro quo and that he was
guessing when he stated otherwise.
Ambassador Sondland, that is, said he
was guessing and that no one on the
planet had told him otherwise.
Ambassador Volker tells us that
President Zelensky didn’t know that
there was a hold on aid on July 25. He
didn’t find out until after he read it in
Politico on July 29.
The aid got released shortly there-
after, and Ukraine didn’t have to do ab-
solutely anything in order to get the
hold released.
When our colleagues on the other
side of the aisle say that the July 25
call transcript says, ‘‘do me a favor,’’
we have to correct them time and
again that it says, ‘‘do us a favor.’’ And
if you look at that paragraph, it is only
about Ukrainians interfering in the
2016 election.
Now, if you want to ignore the Chaly
op-ed; Chalupa worked with the
Ukrainian Embassy to dig up dirt; the
black ledger to bring down the Trump
campaign; whether it is Avakov’s
statement; or the origins of the Steele
dossier—these are all examples. Look
at Ken Vogel’s reporting from January
2017. It is irrefutable.
These are all substance, so stop say-
ing that the facts are uncontested.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
include in the RECORD page 69 of the
Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence’s November 20 open hear-
ing where Deputy Assistant Secretary
of Defense Laura Cooper testified that
the Department of Defense was not
able to distribute all of the aid, with
$35 million not provided, since it was
released so late.
Quick question for you.
And I think just one question for you, Sec-
retary Hale.
Ms. Cooper, was DOD able to put all the se-
curity assistance funds into contract before
the end of the fiscal year?
Ms. Cooper. No, sir.
Mr. Maloney. And how much were they not
able to obligate? What was left unobligated?
Ms. Cooper. I believe the figure was 35 mil-
lion. It’s—we were able to actually obligate
88 percent, total.
Mr. Maloney. And I think you mentioned
that you were able because of legislation
that Congress passed, continuing resolution,
to do that. Is that right?
Ms. Cooper. So the remainder we are in the
process of obligating—
Mr. Maloney. Excuse me. The remainder.
Ms. Cooper.—right now because of the pro-
vision in the continuing resolution.
Mr. Maloney. Right. So, but for literally
an act of Congress, you couldn’t have spent
all the money.
Ms. Cooper. If we had not received the pro-
vision in the continuing resolution, we would
have obligated 88 percent but not the full
amount.
Mr. Maloney. Right. Which, of course,
would be a violation of law, to not spend
money that Congress appropriated.
Ms. Cooper. Sir, I am not a lawyer, but
that is my understanding.
Mr. Maloney. Sure. Thank you.
Secretary Hale, where were you born?
Mr. Hale. Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Mr. Maloney. And is your family from Ire-
land? Am I right about that?
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
include in the RECORD a November 18
AP article entitled, ‘‘U.S. officials
knew of Ukraine’s Trump anxiety.’’
[From the Associated Press, Nov. 18, 2019]
U.S. OFFICIALS KNEW OF UKRAINE’S TRUMP
ANXIETY
(By Desmond Butler and Michael Biesecker)
WASHINGTON (AP)—U.S. State Department
officials were informed that Ukrainian Presi-
dent Volodymyr Zelenskiy was feeling pres-
sure from the Trump administration to in-
vestigate former Vice President Joe Biden
even before the July phone call that has led
to impeachment hearings in Washington,
two people with knowledge of the matter
told The Associated Press.
In early May, officials at the U.S. Embassy
iri Kyiv, including then-Ambassador Marie
Yovanovitch, were told Zelenskiy was seek-
ing advice on how to navigate the difficult
position he was in, the two people told the
AP. He was concerned President Donald
Trump and associates were pressing him to
take action that could affect the 2020 U.S.
presidential race, the two individuals said.
They spoke on condition of anonymity be-
cause of the diplomatic and political sensi-
tivity of the issue.
State Department officials in Kyiv and
Washington were briefed on Zelenskiy’s con-
cerns at least three times, the two sources
said. Notes summarizing his worries were
circulated within the department, they said.
The briefings and the notes show that U.S.
officials knew early that Zelenskiy was feel-
ing pressure to investigate Biden, even
though the Ukrainian leader later denied it
in a joint news conference with Trump in
September.
Congressional Republicans have pointed to
that public Zelenskiy statement to argue
that he felt no pressure to open an investiga-
tion, and therefore the Democrats’ allega-
tions that led to the impeachment hearings
are misplaced.
‘‘Both presidents expressly have stated
there was no pressure, no demand, no condi-
tions, no blackmail, no corruption,’’ one Re-
publican lawmaker, John Ratcliffe of Texas,
argued on the first day of public hearings
last week.
The central allegation in the impeachment
inquiry is that Trump, through his allies, de-
manded that Ukraine, which is fending off
Russian aggression, launch an investigation
that would benefit him politically in ex-
change for crucial military and strategic
support.
Witnesses have detailed, in closed-door
depositions and public impeachment hear-
ings, that allies of Trump pressed Ukraine to
investigate Biden and his son while with-
holding military aid and a coveted meeting
between the newly elected Zelenskiy and
Trump.
The U.S. briefings—and contemporaneous
notes on Zelenskiy’s early anxiety about
Trump’s interest in an investigation—sug-
gest that Democrats have evidence in reach
to contradict Republican arguments that
Zelenskiy never felt pressure to investigate
Biden.
The Associated Press reported last month
about Zelenskiy’s meeting on May 7 with,

two top aides, as well as Andriy Kobolyev,
head of the state-owned natural gas company
Naftogaz, and Amos Hochstein, an American
who sits on the Ukrainian company’s super-
visory board. Ahead of the meeting,
Hochstein told Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambas-
sador, why he was being called in.
Zelenskiy’ s office has not replied to re-
quests for comment about the May 7 meet-
ing.
Notes circulated internally at the State
Department indicated that Zelenskiy tried
to mask the real purpose of his May 7 meet-
ing—which was to talk about political prob-
lems with the White House—by saying it was
about energy, the two people with knowledge
of the matter said.
After the meeting with Zelenskiy,
Hochstein separately briefed two U.S. Em-
bassy officials, Suriya Jayanti and Joseph
Pennington, about Zelenskiy’s concerns, said
the two people who spoke to the AP. Jayanti
and Pennington took notes on the meeting,
the people said.
Hochstein told the embassy officials about
Zelenskiy’s concerns and then traveled to
Washington to update Y ovanovitch on the
meeting. The ambassador, who was facing a
smear campaign, had just been called back
to Washington, where she was informed that
she no longer had the confidence of the presi-
dent. She was relieved of her duties as am-
bassador on May 20.
Jayanti was also one of three witnesses to
a phone call in which Trump discussed his
interest in an investigation of Biden with his
ambassador to the European Union, Gordon
Sondland. The call occurred while Sondland
was having lunch with three embassy offi-
cials in Kyiv. David Holmes, political coun-
sel at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, has already
detailed to House investigators what he
overheard. Jayanti and the third witness,
Tara Maher, have not been interviewed.
Hochstein, a former diplomat who advised
Biden on Ukraine matters during the Obama
administration, has also not been questioned
in the impeachment proceedings.
The Republican arguments about
Zelenskiy’s lack of concern stem from a
Sept. 25 joint media appearance by the
American and Ukrainian leaders in which
Zelenskiy discussed the July call with
Trump that effectively launched the im-
peachment inquiry.
The appearance came shortly after Trump
released a rough transcript of the call.
‘‘You heard that we had, I think, good
phone call. It was normal. We spoke about
many things. And I—so I think, and you read
it, that nobody pushed—pushed me,’’
Zelenskiy said in the appearance with Trump
on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assem-
bly meeting in New York.
‘‘In other words, no pressure,’’ Trump
spoke up to add.
In the impeachment hearings, Democrats
have countered that Zelenskiy’s public com-
ments came when he was trying to calm the
waters with the U.S. president in the imme-
diate wake of the transcript’s release. The
burgeoning scandal has brought further un-
certainty for Ukraine with its most impor-
tant Western partner as the country faces
simmering conflict with Russia. Zelenskiy’s
May 7 meeting suggests that he had been
concerned about U.S. support from the start.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I

Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. LEE).
Ms. LEE of California. Madam
Speaker, first of all, let me just say, I
taught my children that there are con-
sequences if they break the law.
I am saddened, but I am not shocked,
that we are here today considering Ar-
ticles of Impeachment against Presi-
dent Trump. I am saddened, but I am
not shocked because of the pattern of
corruption we have seen from this
President.
Yes, I am saddened, but I am not
shocked because this President has
routinely shown his disregard of Con-
gress and the rule of law.
The facts are not in dispute. The
President abused his power, defied the
public’s trust, and betrayed his oath of
office. He undermined our elections by
corruptly soliciting foreign inter-
ference in our elections to benefit his
own future reelection efforts. Then he
obstructed Congress every step of the
way in an effort to cover it all up.
Donald Trump has been and remains
a threat to our national security, a
clear danger to our democracy, and
wholly unfit to serve as President of
the United States.
We have an obligation to act today to
uphold the Constitution, but also to
show our children and grandchildren
that no one is above the law, and that
includes the President of the United
States.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Massachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN).
Mrs. TRAHAN. Madam Speaker,
today, I rise to defend our democracy.
In this Chamber, we debate the Na-
tion’s most pressing issues, and often,
reasonable people can draw different
conclusions. But not today.
The facts are black and white. Presi-
dent Trump abused the power of his of-
fice for personal and political gain, and
then he engaged in a coverup. It is up
to us to confront those facts and vote
to preserve and protect our democratic
Republic.
This is not a fight I or my colleagues
sought out when we ran for Congress,
but it is one we pledged when we raised
our right hand and swore an oath to de-
fend our Constitution.
Anything other than a vote to im-
peach will be read as a vote endorsing
a future President without rules or
consequences, an ‘‘anything goes, no
holds barred’’ brand of executive
branch authority that will leave us
weaker and surely undermine what the
Framers passed down.
We owe it to future generations to
transcend personal interests and party
loyalty and to vote our conscience for
what is really at stake here today, the
sanctity of our Constitution and the
sanctity of our democracy.

tinue to reserve the balance of my

Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I

‘‘Ukraine Knew of Aid Freeze by Early
August, Undermining Trump Defense.’’
[From The New York Times, Oct. 23, 2019]
UKRAINE KNEW OF AID FREEZE BY EARLY
AUGUST, UNDERMINING TRUMP DEFENSE
TOP OFFICIALS WERE TOLD IN EARLY AUGUST
ABOUT THE DELAY OF $391 MILLION IN SECU-
RITY ASSISTANCE, UNDERCUTTING A CHIEF AR-
GUMENT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS USED TO
DENY ANY QUID PRO QUO.
(By Andrew E. Kramer and Kenneth P.
Vogel)
KIEV, UKRAINE—To Democrats who say
that President Trump’s decision to freeze
$391 million in military aid was intended to
bully Ukraine’s leader into carrying out in-
vestigations for Mr. Trump’s political ben-
efit, the president and his allies have had a
simple response: There was no quid pro quo
because the Ukrainians did not know assist-
ance had been blocked.
But then on Tuesday, William B. Taylor
Jr., the top United States diplomat in Kiev,
told House impeachment investigators that
the freeze was directly linked to Mr. Trump’s
demand. That did not deter the president,
who on Wednesday approvingly tweeted a
quote by a congressional Republican saying
neither Mr. Taylor nor any other witness had
‘‘provided testimony that the Ukrainians
were aware that military aid was being with-
held.’’
In fact, word of the aid freeze had gotten to
high-level Ukrainian officials by the first
week in August, according to interviews and
documents obtained by The New York
Times.
The problem was not bureaucratic, the
Ukrainians were told. To address it, they
were advised, they should reach out to Mick
Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of
staff, according to the interviews and
records.
The timing of the communications, which
have not previously been reported, shows
that Ukraine was aware the White House was
holding up the funds weeks earlier than ac-
knowledged.
It also means that the Ukrainian govern-
ment was aware of the freeze during most of
the period in August when Mr. Trump’s per-
sonal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and two
American diplomats were pressing President
Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to make a
public commitment to the investigations.

H12124 December 18, 2019
The communications did not explicitly
link the assistance freeze to the push by Mr.
Trump and Mr. Giuliani for the investiga-
tions. But in the communications, officials
from the United States and Ukraine discuss
the need to bring in the same senior aide to
Mr. Zelensky who had been dealing with Mr.
Giuliani about Mr. Trump’s demands for the
investigations, signaling a possible link be-
tween the matters.
Word of the aid freeze got to the Ukrain-
ians at a moment when Mr. Zelensky, who
had taken office a little more than two
months earlier after a campaign in which he
promised to root out corruption and stand up
to Russia, was off balance and uncertain how
to stabilize his country’s relationship with
the United States.
Days earlier, he had listened to Mr. Trump
implore him on a half-hour call to pursue in-
vestigations touching on former Vice Presi-
dent Joseph R. Biden Jr. and a debunked
conspiracy theory about Ukrainian involve-
ment in the 2016 hacking of the Democratic
National Committee. Mr. Zelensky’s efforts
to secure a visit to the White House—a sym-
bolic affirmation of support he considered
vital at a time when Russia continued to
menace Ukraine’s eastern border—seemed to
be stalled. American policy toward Ukraine
was being guided not by career professionals
but by Mr. Giuliani.
Mr. Taylor testified to the impeachment
investigators that he was told it was only on
the sidelines of a Sept. 1 meeting between
Mr. Zelensky and Vice President Mike Pence
in Warsaw that the Ukrainians were directly
informed by Gordon D. Sondland, the United
States ambassador to the European Union,
that the aid would be dependent on Mr.
Zelensky giving Mr. Trump something he
wanted: an investigation into Burisma, the
company that had employed Mr. Biden’s
younger son, Hunter Biden.
American and Ukrainian officials have as-
serted that Ukraine learned that the aid had
been held up only around the time it became
public through a news article at the end of
August.
The aid freeze is drawing additional scru-
tiny from the impeachment investigators on
Wednesday as they question Laura K. Coo-
per, a deputy assistant defense secretary for
Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia. This month,
Democrats subpoenaed both the Defense De-
partment and the White House Office of Man-
agement and Budget for records related to
the assistance freeze.
As Mr. Taylor’s testimony suggests, the
Ukrainians did not confront the Trump ad-
ministration about the freeze until they
were told in September that it was linked to
the demand for the investigations. The
Ukrainians appear to have initially been
hopeful that the problem could be resolved
quietly and were reluctant to risk a public
clash at a delicate time in relations between
the two nations.
‘‘They didn’t even know the money wasn’t
paid,’’ Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter last
month.
The disclosure that the Ukrainians knew
of the freeze by early August corroborates,
and provides additional details about, a
claim made by a C.I.A. officer in his whistle-
blower complaint that prompted the im-
peachment inquiry by House Democrats.
‘‘As of early August, I heard from U.S. offi-
cials that some Ukrainian officials were
aware that U.S. aid might be in jeopardy,
but I do not know how or when they learned
of it,’’ the anonymous whistle-blower wrote.
The complainant said that he learned that
the instruction to freeze the assistance ‘‘had
come directly from the president,’’ and said
it ‘‘might have a connection with the overall
effort to pressure Ukrainian leadership.’’
Publicly, Mr. Zelensky has insisted he felt
no pressure to pursue the investigations
sought by Mr. Trump.
‘‘There was no blackmail,’’ Mr. Zelensky
said at a news conference this month. He
cited as evidence that he ‘‘had no idea the
military aid was held up’’ at the time of his
July 25 call with Mr. Trump, when Mr.
Trump pressed him for investigations into
the Bidens and a debunked conspiracy theory
about Ukrainian involvement in the hacking
of the Democratic National Committee in
2016.
Mr. Zelensky has said he knew about the
holdup of the military aid before his meeting
in Poland on Sept. 1 with Mr. Pence, but has
been vague about exactly when he learned
about it. ‘‘When I did find out, I raised it
with Pence at a meeting in Warsaw,’’ he said
this month.
In conversations over several days in early
August, a Pentagon official discussed the as-
sistance freeze directly with a Ukrainian
government official, according to records
and interviews. The Pentagon official sug-
gested that Mr. Mulvaney had been pushing
for the assistance to be withheld, and urged
the Ukrainians to reach out to him.
The Pentagon official described Mr.
Mulvaney’s motivations only in broad terms
but made clear that the same Ukrainian offi-
cial, Andriy Yermak, who had been negoti-
ating with Mr. Giuliani over the investiga-
tions and a White House visit being sought
by Mr. Zelensky should also reach out to Mr.
Mulvaney over the hold on military aid.
A senior administration official who spoke
on the condition of anonymity to speak pub-
licly about the issue said on Monday that
Mr. Mulvaney ‘‘had absolutely no commu-
nication with the Ukranians about this
issue.’’
Ukrainian officials had grown suspicious
that the assistance was in jeopardy because
formal talks with the Pentagon on its re-
lease had concluded by June without any ap-
parent problem.
In talks during the spring with American
officials, the Ukrainians had resolved condi-
tions for the release of the assistance, and
believed everything was on schedule, accord-
ing to Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze,
Ukraine’s former vice prime minister for
Euro-Atlantic Integration.
But by early August, the Ukrainians were
struggling to get clear answers from their
American contacts about the status of the
assistance, according to American officials
familiar with the Ukrainians’ efforts.
In the days and weeks after top Ukrainian
officials were alerted to the aid freeze, Mr.
Sondland and Kurt D. Volker, then the State
Department’s special envoy to Ukraine, were
working with Mr. Giuliani to draft a state-
ment for Mr. Zelensky to deliver that would
commit him to pursuing the investigations,
according to text messages between the men
turned over to the House impeachment in-
vestigators.
The text messages between Mr. Volker, Mr.
Sondland and the top Zelensky aide did not
mention the holdup of the aid. It was only in
September, after the Warsaw meeting, that
Mr. Taylor wrote in a text message to Mr.
Sandland, ‘‘I think it’s crazy to withhold se-
curity assistance for help with a political
campaign.’’
After being informed on Sept. 1 in Warsaw
that the aid would be released only if Mr.
Zelensky agreed to the investigations,
Ukrainian officials, including their national
security adviser and defense minister, were
troubled by their inability to get answers to
questions about the freeze from United
States officials, Mr. Taylor testified.
Through the summer, Mr. Zelensky had
been noncommittal about the demands from
Mr. Volker, Mr. Sandland and Mr. Giuliani
for a public commitment to the investiga-
tions. On Sept. 5, Mr. Taylor testified, Mr.
Zelensky met in Kiev with Senators Ron
Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, and
Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Con-
necticut.
Mr. Zelensky’s first question, Mr. Taylor
said, was about the security aid. The sen-
ators responded, Mr. Taylor said, that Mr.
Zelensky ‘‘should not jeopardize bipartisan
support by getting drawn into U.S. domestic
politics.’’
But Mr. Sondland was still pressing for a
commitment from Mr. Zelensky, and was
pressing him to do a CNN interview in which
he would talk about pursuing the investiga-
tions sought by Mr. Trump.
Mr. Zelensky never did the interview and
never made the public commitment sought
by the White House, although a Ukrainian
prosecutor later said he would ‘‘audit’’ a case
involving the owner of the company that
paid Hunter Biden as a board member.
Mr. Giuliani has said he had nothing to do
with the assistance freeze and did not talk to
Mr. Trump or ‘‘anybody in the government’’
about it. ‘‘I didn’t know about it until I read
about it in the newspaper,’’ he said in an
interview last week.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. SARBANES).
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the two Articles of Impeach-
ment against President Trump for
abuse of power and obstruction of Con-
gress.
Voting to impeach the President is a
weighty decision. It is not something
you reach for; it is something you are
brought to reluctantly when the evi-
dence presented can no longer be de-
nied.
In this sober and historic moment,
Members of Congress are called upon to
uphold our oath of office and our duty
to the Constitution. Today, we answer
that call.
The President’s actions compromised
the national security of the United
States, undermined the integrity of our
democratic process, and betrayed the
trust of the American people.
In soliciting foreign interference,
President Trump took direct aim at
the heart of our democracy. The Amer-
ican people should decide our elections,
not a foreign country. As long as the
President continues to invite foreign
interference into our democracy, the
integrity of the 2020 election remains
at risk.
The question is: Will Congress allow
the President to place his personal in-
terests above those of his country?
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues in the House to join me in an-
swering that question with a resound-
ing ‘‘no’’ because no one, not even the
President of the United States, is
above the law.

[From POLITICO Magazine, October 9, 2019]
THIS IS WHAT A LEGITIMATE ANTI-CORRUPTION
EFFORT IN UKRAINE WOULD LOOK LIKE
(By Samantha Vinograd)
President Donald Trump insists there’s an
innocent explanation for the July 25 phone
call in which he asked Ukraine’s president to
investigate political rival Joe Biden. ‘‘I don’t
care about Biden’s campaign,’’ he told re-
porters on Friday, ‘‘but I do care about cor-
ruption.’’ Now, congressional Republicans
seem to be bolstering that defense. Sen.
Lindsey Graham said on Tuesday that he
will invite Rudy Giuliani, a key player in
Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, to testify on
corruption in the country—an odd choice
when Graham could have asked, for example,
a U.S. government official who is an author-
ized expert on corruption in Ukraine.
When it comes to the Bidens, asking a for-
eign country to investigate an American,
when there is no domestic criminal inves-
tigation into him, is a non-starter. We have
domestic law enforcement avenues for that.
But there is no evidence of wrongdoing by
Biden and no criminal investigation into his
activities.
If Trump were really, legitimately focused
on rooting out corruption in Ukraine, how-
ever—whether at companies like Burisma,
which employed Hunter Biden, or within the
government—there are U.S. government
processes for doing so, when there is a cred-
ible case. Here’s what they are:
STEP 1: STOP CUTTING STATE DEPARTMENT
ANTI-CORRUPTION FUNDING
There is an entire State Department bu-
reau—the Bureau of International Narcotics
and Law Enforcement (INL)—focused on law
enforcement efforts overseas, including in-
vestigating corruption. INL is headquartered
in Washington, but it has experts serving at
many U.S. missions overseas. The officials at
INL work with their foreign diplomatic
counterparts—some willing and some less
so—as well as non-governmental organiza-
tions and law enforcement agencies at the
local, national and international level to
support foreign governments’ efforts to build
sound institutions by sharing best practices,
training and giving grants. In Ukraine, that
work has included supporting the establish-
ment of the National Anti-Corruption Bu-
reau of Ukraine and the Special Anti-Corrup-
tion Prosecutor’s Office. INL and its part-
ners can investigate and report on corrup-
tion and even take actions to punish it, like
barring entry to the United States for cer-
tain foreigners.
Strangely, while Trump has a new-found
interest in fighting ‘‘corruption’’—at least
that associated with his political rivals—his
administration has requested less money for
INL, not more. In fiscal year 2019, the bureau
was granted $5 million, but State requested
$3 million for fiscal year 2020. If the presi-
dent were really concerned about corruption
in Ukraine, he and Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo should have requested more re-
sources for INL work there.
STEP 2: ALERT THE UKRAINE AMBASSADOR, AND
LET HIM DEAL WITH IT
If Trump and Pompeo really wanted to po-
lice corruption in Ukraine, they would have
first alerted the acting U.S. ambassador
there to specific concerns, like Ukrainian ex-
ecutives laundering money or a Ukrainian
official misusing his or her position (such as
the former prosecutor general mentioned in
Trump’s phone call). Ambassadors can’t
interfere in a corruption investigation or di-
rect that one be opened, but they can pass
information along to experts at the em-
bassy—including INL experts and Depart-
ment of Justice personnel.
Those U.S. law enforcement professionals
in the foreign country could see if there were
a basis for them to open a criminal inves-
tigation based on that concern, and U.S.
anti-corruption experts there could review
suspect activity and decide how best to ad-
dress them with the relevant Ukrainian offi-
cials. If there were law enforcement concerns
about an American’s involvement, DOJ could
coordinate on that with Ukraine’s Ministry
of Justice.
For instance, the chargé d’affaires in Kiev,
Ambassador William Taylor, and his team
could send a ‘‘demarche’’—an official state-
ment of U.S. policy with respect to a corrupt
activity or individual—to Ukrainian officials
at the Ministry of Justice or in Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelensky’s office and
try to sort out ways to address them. EU
Ambassador Gordon Sandland and former
special envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker had
to have been aware of these official channels
for addressing corruption.
STEP 3. REQUEST COOPERATION (OFFICIALLY)
Trump and his team have another tool at
their disposal to investigate corruption in
Ukraine related to an ongoing criminal case:
the United States’ Mutual Legal Assistance
Treaty (MLAT) with the country. MLATs
are international agreements that establish
a formal process for one country to gather
evidence in another country for a criminal
investigation.
If there were an actual U.S. government
investigation into alleged criminal activity
by Americans in Ukraine, or foreigners sus-
pected of violating U.S. laws, a request for
cooperation could have been made through a
formal process that’s run by DOJ’s Office of
International Affairs. Once MLAT requests
are vetted by the DOJ, they are transmitted
to a foreign country’s ‘‘central authority’’—
in this case, Ukraine’s Ministry of Justice. If
granted in the foreign country, this arrange-
ment could allow the DOJ to obtain docu-
ments, locate people, take testimony, re-
quest searches and seizures, freeze assets and
more. If the United States were actually pur-
suing criminal investigations into corrup-
tion in Ukraine, U.S. officials would have
made a request under our MLAT for coopera-
tion.
The United States even has a Mutual Legal
Assistance Agreement (MLAA) with China,
the country that Trump called on last week
to investigate Biden, after the whistleblower
complaint was made public.
There is no shortage of official options
when it comes to cooperation on criminal
matters and fighting corruption with a for-
eign country—whether it be with the
Ukrainians or the Chinese or anyone else. If
the president actually cared about address-
ing corruption in Ukraine more broadly, he
would ensure that experts like INL staffers
at the State Department have the resources
they need to do their jobs. The fact that
Giuliani was his answer suggests that some-
thing very different is going on here.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Florida (Ms. CASTOR).
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam
Speaker, the President abused his
power. He violated his oath of office.
He sought to elevate himself as a dic-
tator or king. But we are not a mon-
archy. We are the United States of
America. We are a republic, a democ-
racy, where the executive does not
have absolute power. America was
founded on a system of checks and bal-
ances.
When the President withheld mili-
tary aid to vulnerable Ukraine and
pressed for a personal favor to manu-
facture dirt against a political oppo-
nent, he went too far. He undermined
America’s national security. He sought
to sabotage our elections. He elevated
his personal interests over the inter-
ests of America. Then, he tried to cover
up his scandalous behavior, and he ob-
structed the investigation.
He violated his oath of office, but I
intend to uphold mine to protect and
defend the Constitution of the United
States of America. The President must
be impeached today.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
include in the RECORD a December 5,
2019, Boston Globe editorial entitled
‘‘Impeach the President.’’
[Editorial: Boston Globe, December 5, 2019]
IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT
From the founding of this country, the
power of the president was understood to
have limits. Indeed, the Founders would
never have written an impeachment clause
into the Constitution if they did not foresee
scenarios where their descendants might
need to remove an elected president before
the end of his term in order to protect the
American people and the nation.
The question before the country now is
whether President Trump’s misconduct is se-
vere enough that Congress should exercise
that impeachment power, less than a year
before the 2020 election. The results of the
House Intelligence Committee inquiry, re-
leased to the public on Tuesday, make clear
that the answer is an urgent yes. Not only
has the president abused his power by trying
to extort a foreign country to meddle in US
politics, but he also has endangered the in-
tegrity of the election itself. He has also ob-
structed the congressional investigation into
his conduct, a precedent that will lead to a
permanent diminution of congressional
power if allowed to stand.
The evidence that Trump is a threat to the
constitutional system is more than suffi-
cient, and a slate of legal scholars who testi-
fied on Wednesday made clear that Trump’s
actions are just the sort of presidential be-
havior the Founders had in mind when they
devised the recourse of impeachment. The
decision by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to
proceed with drafting articles of impeach-
ment is warranted.
Much of the information in the Intel-
ligence Committee report, which was based
on witness interviews, documents, telephone
records, and public statements by adminis-
tration officials, was already known to the
public. The cohesive narrative that emerges,
though, is worse than the sum of its parts.
This year, the president and subordinates
acting at his behest repeatedly tried to pres-
sure a foreign country, Ukraine, into taking
steps to help the president’s reelection. That
was, by itself, an outrageous betrayal: In his
dealings with foreign states, the president
has an obligation to represent America’s in-
terests, not his own.
But the president also betrayed the US
taxpayer to advance that corrupt agenda. In
order to pressure Ukraine into acceding to
his request, Trump’s administration held up
$391 million in aid allocated by Congress. In
other words, he demanded a bribe in the form
of political favors in exchange for an official
act—the textbook definition of corruption.
The fact that the money was ultimately
paid, after a whistle-blower complained, is

immaterial: The act of withholding taxpayer
money to support a personal political goal
was an impermissible abuse of the presi-
dent’s power.
Withholding the money also sabotaged
American foreign policy. The United States
provides military aid to Ukraine to protect
the country from Russian aggression. Ensur-
ing that fragile young democracy does not
fall under Moscow’s sway is a key US policy
goal, and one that the president put at risk
for his personal benefit. He has shown the
world that he is willing to corrupt the Amer-
ican policy agenda for purposes of political
gain, which will cast suspicion on the moti-
vations of the United States abroad if Con-
gress does not act.
To top off his misconduct, after Congress
got wind of the scheme and started the im-
peachment inquiry, the Trump administra-
tion refused to comply with subpoenas, in-
structed witnesses not to testify, and intimi-
dated witnesses who did. That ought to form
the basis of an article of impeachment. When
the president obstructs justice and fails to
respect the power of Congress, it strikes at
the heart of the separation of powers and
will hobble future oversight of presidents of
all parties.
Impeachment does not require a crime.
The Constitution entrusts Congress with the
impeachment power in order to protect
Americans from a president who is betraying
their interests. And it is very much in Amer-
icans’ interests to maintain checks and bal-
ances in the federal government; to have a
foreign policy that the world can trust is
based on our national interest instead of the
president’s personal needs; to control federal
spending through their elected representa-
tives; to vote in fair elections untainted by
foreign interference. For generations, Ameri-
cans have enjoyed those privileges. What’s at
stake now is whether we will keep them. The
facts show that the president has threatened
this country’s core values and the integrity
of our democracy. Congress now has a duty
to future generations to impeach him.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
include in the RECORD the December 11,
2019, USA Today editorial entitled ‘‘Im-
peach President Trump: The Presi-
dent’s Ukraine shakedown and
stonewalling are too serious for the
House to ignore.’’
[From USA Today, Dec. 12, 2019]
USA TODAY’S EDITORIAL BOARD: IMPEACH
PRESIDENT TRUMP
(The Editorial Board)
‘‘Put your own narrow interests ahead of
the nation’s, flout the law, violate the trust
given to you by the American people and
recklessly disregard the oath of office, and
you risk losing your job.’’
USA TODAY’s Editorial Board wrote those
words two decades ago when it endorsed the
impeachment of President Bill Clinton, a
Democrat. Now, in graver circumstances
with America’s system of checks and bal-
ances at stake, they apply to another presi-
dent facing impeachment, Republican Don-
ald Trump.
The current board has made no secret of
our low regard for Trump’s character and
conduct. Yet, as fellow passengers on the
ship of state, we had hoped the captain
would succeed. And, until recently, we be-
lieved that impeachment proceedings would
be unhealthier for an already polarized na-
tion than simply leaving Trump’s fate up to
voters next November.
TRUMP LEAVES DEMOCRATS LITTLE CHOICE
Unless public sentiment shifts sharply in
the days and weeks ahead, that is the likely
outcome of this process—impeachment by
the Democratic-controlled House of Rep-
resentatives followed by acquittal in the
GOP-controlled Senate. So why bother? Be-
cause Trump’s egregious transgressions and
stonewalling have given the House little
choice but to press ahead with the most se-
vere sanction at its disposal.
Clinton was impeached by the House (but
not removed by the Senate) after he tried to
cover up an affair with a White House intern.
Trump used your tax dollars to shake down
a vulnerable foreign government to interfere
in a U.S. election for his personal benefit.
GOP leader on House Judiciary Com-
mittee: Articles establish nothing impeach-
able and allege no crime
In his thuggish effort to trade American
arms for foreign dirt on former Vice Presi-
dent Joe Biden and his son Hunter, Trump
resembles not so much Clinton as he does
Richard Nixon, another corrupt president
who tried to cheat his way to reelection.
This isn’t partisan politics as usual. It is
precisely the type of misconduct the framers
had in mind when they wrote impeachment
into the Constitution. Alexander Hamilton
supported a robust presidency but worried
about ‘‘a man unprincipled in private life
desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper’’
coming to power. Impeachment, Hamilton
wrote, was a mechanism to protect the na-
tion ‘‘from the abuse or violation of some
public trust.’’
APPROVE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT
Both articles of impeachment drafted by
the House Judiciary Committee warrant ap-
proval:
Abuse of power. Testimony before the
House Intelligence Committee produced
overwhelming evidence that Trump wanted
Ukraine’s new president to announce inves-
tigations into the Bidens and a debunked
theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered
in the 2016 U.S. election.
To pressure the Ukrainian leader, Trump
withheld a White House meeting and nearly
$400 million in congressionally approved se-
curity aid, funding that was released only
after an unnamed official blew the whistle.
To former national security adviser John
Bolton, the months-long scheme was the
equivalent of a ‘‘drug deal.’’ To Bolton’s
former aide Fiona Hill, it was a ‘‘domestic
political errand’’ that ‘‘is all going to blow
up.’’ To Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in
Ukraine, ‘‘it’s crazy to withhold security as-
sistance for help with a political campaign.’’
And to Ukrainian soldiers, fighting to fend
off Russian aggression in the eastern part of
their country, the money was a matter of
life and death.
Obstruction of Congress. Trump has met
the impeachment investigation with out-
right and unprecedented defiance. The White
House has withheld documents, ordered exec-
utive branch agencies not to comply with
subpoenas and directed administration offi-
cials not to testify.
Allowing this obstruction to stand unchal-
lenged would put the president above the law
and permanently damage Congress’ ability
to investigate misconduct by presidents of
either party.
The president’s GOP enablers continue to
place power and party ahead of truth and
country. Had any Democratic president be-
haved the way Trump has—paying hush
money to a porn star, flattering dictators
and spewing an unending stream of false-
hoods—there’s no doubt congressional Re-
publicans would have tried to run him out of
the White House in a New York minute.
Twenty-seven Republicans who voted to im-
peach or convict Clinton remain in Congress.
If they continue to defend Trump, history
will record their hypocrisy.
Our support for Trump’s impeachment by
the House—we’ll wait for the Senate trial to
render a verdict on removal from office—has
nothing to do with policy differences. We
have had profound disagreements with the
president on a host of issues, led by his reck-
less deficits and inattention to climate
change, both of which will burden genera-
tions to come.
Policy differences are not, however,
grounds for impeachment. Constitutional
violations are.
Bill Clinton should be impeached and stand
trial ‘‘because the charges are too serious
and the evidence amassed too compelling’’ to
ignore, the Editorial Board wrote in Decem-
ber 1998.
The same can be said this December about
the allegations facing Donald Trump. Only
much more so.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ).
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Madam Speaker, throughout this proc-
ess, I listened, as a member of the
House Committee on Oversight and Re-
form, to career diplomats testify in
depositions and found myself contem-
plating the gravity of this decision.
One of my daughters asked then how
I would make my decision about im-
peachment. I told her that, when her
future children learn about President
Trump’s impeachment, they may ask:
‘‘Mommy, what did Grandma do?’’ I
want my daughter to be able to tell her
children Grandma did the right thing
because, in America, no one is above
the law.
With his conduct around Ukraine,
President Trump corruptly abused his
power for his own interests, at direct
odds with our national welfare and our
Constitution. This President put his in-
terests before those of this Nation. Left
unchecked, he would do it again and
has said so.
The actions and ongoing schemes
that led us to this moment are severe
threats to our national security and
democracy that we cannot defend or
dismiss.
With history watching, I must fulfill
my constitutional duty and vote to im-
peach this President. His corrupt con-
duct and assault on our Constitution
leave no other choice.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
California (Mr. KHANNA).
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker,
today, the House is voting to affirm a
conservative principle. What makes
America the strongest and most pros-
perous nation in the world is our rev-
erence for the rule of law. It is our love
of the law that protects our freedoms,
our private property, and our families
from the exercise of arbitrary power.
The real threat to American leader-
ship in the 21st century is internal de-
cline. We choose not to stand idly by
while we see the corrupting of our body
politic with an attitude that might
makes right, that winners don’t have
to follow the rules.

Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
include in the RECORD a December 17
CNN article entitled ‘‘Fact check:
Trump’s wild letter to Pelosi is filled
with false and misleading claims.’’
[From CNN, December 17, 2019]
FACT CHECK: TRUMP’S WILD LETTER TO
PELOSI IS FILLED WITH FALSE AND MIS-
LEADING CLAIMS
(By Daniel Dale and Tara Subramaniam,
CNN)
Washington (CNN)—It was on White House
letterhead. It read like a string of President
Donald Trump’s tweets.
And it was just as dishonest.
On Tuesday afternoon, Trump released a
six-page letter to House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi in which—employing his distinctive
vocabulary and punctuation—he blasted
Democrats’ push to impeach him, defended
his dealings with Ukraine and touted his ac-
complishments in office.
Like much of his previous rhetoric about
Ukraine and impeachment, much of the let-
ter was false or misleading.
Trump repeated multiple false claims that
have been debunked on numerous occasions.
He also delivered some new claims that were
false, misleading or lacking in context.
We’re not finished going through all of
Trump’s claims in his letter, but here are
some early fact checks.
DEALINGS WITH UKRAINE
Trump decried ‘‘the so-called whistle-
blower who started this entire hoax with a
false report of the phone call that bears no
relationship to the actual phone call that
was made.’’
Facts First: The whistleblower’s account
of Trump’s July call with Ukrainian Presi-
dent Volodymyr Zelensky has been proven
highly accurate. In fact, the rough transcript
released by Trump himself showed that the
whistleblower’s three primary allegations
about the call were correct or very close to
correct. You can read a full fact check here.
Trump claimed the whistleblower ‘‘dis-
appeared’’ because ‘‘they got caught, their
report was a fraud.’’
Facts First: There is no evidence the whis-
tleblower has disappeared, let alone that
they have vanished because they were shown
to be inaccurate. Whistleblowers do not have
an obligation to speak publicly after filing
their anonymous complaints.
Trump wrote, ‘‘Ambassador Sondland tes-
tified that I told him: ‘No quid pro quo. I
want nothing. I want nothing. I want Presi-
dent Zelensky to do the right thing, do what
he ran on.’ ’’
Facts First: Sondland, Trump’s ambas-
sador to the European Union, did testify that
Trump told him this—but Sondland nonethe-
less said that, in his own opinion, there was
indeed a quid pro quo.
Trump wrote that the rough transcript of
his call with Zelensky ‘‘was immediately
made available.’’
Facts First: The call occurred in July.
Trump released the rough transcript in Sep-
tember, after the public learned of the exist-
ence of the whistleblower complaint about
the call.
Trump wrote, ‘‘President Zelensky has re-
peatedly declared that I did nothing wrong,
and that there was No Pressure. He further
emphasized that it was a ‘good phone call,’
that ‘I don’t feel pressure,’ and explicitly
stressed that ‘nobody pushed me.’ ’’
Facts First: Zelensky did say there had
been ‘‘no pressure’’ from Trump and made
other statements to that effect, but he has
not gone so far as to say Trump did nothing
wrong.
In an interview published by Time maga-
zine in early December, Zelensky did say,
‘‘Look, I never talked to the President from
the position of a quid pro quo. That’s not my
thing.’’ But Zelensky continued: ‘‘I don’t
want us to look like beggars. But you have
to understand. We’re at war. If you’re our
strategic partner, then you can’t go blocking
anything for us. I think that’s just about
fairness. It’s not about a quid pro quo. It just
goes without saying.’’
Trump wrote, ‘‘I said to President
Zelensky: ‘I would like you to do us a favor,
though, because our country has been
through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about
it.’ I said do us a favor, not me, and our
country, not a campaign. I then mentioned
the Attorney General of the United States.’’
Facts First: It’s worth noting that Trump
only adopted this explanation for his ‘‘favor’’
comments more than two months after he
released the rough transcript of the July
call. Trump quoted himself accurately here—
but in between his ‘‘favor’’ sentence to
Zelensky and his mention of the attorney
general, he had asked Zelensky to look into
a debunked conspiracy theory about Demo-
cratic computer servers. In his next series of
comments to Zelensky, after Zelensky
spoke, Trump asked Zelensky to look into
former vice president and current Demo-
cratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
JOE BIDEN AND UKRAINE
Trump wrote that Biden ‘‘used his office
and $1 billion dollars of U.S. aid money to
coerce Ukraine into firing the prosecutor
who was digging into the company paying
his son millions of dollars.’’
Facts First: There is a lot wrong with this
claim. The $1 billion in question was a loan
guarantee, not an aid payment. The pros-
ecutor, Viktor Shokin, was widely viewed by
American diplomats and in the international
community as corrupt; Biden was pursuing
official policy in pushing for Shokin’s oust-
er. And the prosecutor’s former deputy has
said that the investigation into the company
where Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, sat on the
board of directors was dormant at the time
Joe Biden applied the pressure.
Trump wrote, ‘‘Biden openly stated: ‘I said,
‘‘I’m telling you, you’re not getting the bil-
lion dollars’’ . . . I looked at them and said:
‘‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is
not fired, you’re not getting the money.’’
Well, son of a bitch. He got fired.’ ’’ Even Joe
Biden admitted just days ago in an interview
with NPR that it ‘looked bad.’ ’’
Facts First: Trump was not entirely clear
on what he meant by ‘‘it,’’ but he left open
the impression that Biden had recently told
NPR that his effort to oust Shokin, or the
2018 video of him telling the story of his ef-
fort to oust Shokin, ‘‘looked bad.’’ In fact,
Biden’s ‘‘looked bad’’ comment was about
something different: Hunter Biden’s position
on the board. Specifically, Biden said ‘‘the
appearance’’ of Hunter Biden’s presence on
the board ‘‘looked bad and it gave folks like
Rudy Giuliani an excuse to come up with a
Trumpian kind of defense.’’
Trump wrote, ‘‘Now you are trying to im-
peach me by falsely accusing me of doing
what Joe Biden has admitted he actually
did.’’
Facts First: Democrats are accusing
Trump of abuse of power for soliciting for-
eign interference in the presidential election
and for trying to use official acts to pressure
the Ukrainian government into doing some-
thing that would help him personally. Biden
has not admitted to anything of the sort.
THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS
Trump wrote, ‘‘I have been denied the most
fundamental rights afforded by the Constitu-
tion, including the right to present evidence,
to have my own counsel present, to confront
accusers, and to call and cross-examine wit-
nesses.’’
Facts First: The constitutional rights of
criminal defendants do not apply to public
officials in a House of Representatives im-
peachment process, though Trump is free to
argue that they should. Trump’s counsel was
denied the opportunity to participate in
House Intelligence Committee impeachment
hearings but was invited to participate in
House Judiciary Committee hearings;
Trump’s counsel declined that opportunity.
House Republicans were allowed to have
their lawyer question witnesses at the House
Intelligence Committee.
Trump wrote, ‘‘More due process was af-
forded to those accused in the Salem Witch
Trials.’’
Facts First: Trump might have meant this
as a non-literal figure of speech, but as a fac-
tual matter, the claim is absurd. (Salem’s
current mayor told Trump to ‘‘learn some
history.’’) Nineteen innocent people were
hanged after they were accused of witchcraft
in the trials of the late 1600s. The courts ac-
cepted ‘‘spectral evidence’’ from dreams.
Some of the accused were tortured into con-
fessions.
DEMOCRATS
Trump wrote of Hillary Clinton: ‘‘Your
chosen candidate lost the election in 2016, in
an Electoral College landslide (306–227).’’
Facts First: Leaving aside Trump’s charac-
terization of the result as a ‘‘landslide,’’ he
got the numbers wrong—again. If he was
going by the number of electoral votes each
candidate earned in the voting, the result
was 306 for him to 232 for Clinton. If he was
going by the final result, after some ‘‘faith-
less electors’’ defected from both him and
Clinton, the result was 304 for him to 227 for
Clinton. This was not a one-time slip; Trump
is habitually inaccurate about this.
Trump said Pelosi has a policy of ‘‘open
borders.’’
Facts First: While Pelosi wants a more lib-
eral immigration policy than he does, she
does not support completely unrestricted mi-
gration. She has repeatedly endorsed funding
for border security measures aside from the
President’s proposed wall.
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION
Trump again claimed the cost of the
Mueller investigation was ‘‘45 million dol-
lars.’’
Facts First: The investigation cost $32 mil-
lion, according to figures released by the
Justice Department, and the government is
expected to recoup about $17 million as a re-
sult of the investigation, most from former
Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort,
according to a CNN analysis of the sentences
handed out to people charged by Mueller.
Trump said that the world now knows that
former FBI Director James Comey is ‘‘one of
the dirtiest cops our Nation has ever seen.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H12128 December 18, 2019
Facts First: We give Trump wide latitude
to express opinions about public figures, but
the December report from Justice Depart-
ment Inspector General Michael Horowitz
presented no evidence that Comey was cor-
rupt in any way. Horowitz found significant
errors in FBI work connected to the Russia
investigation, and rejected Comey’s claim of
vindication, but he did not make any finding
accusing Comey of deliberate malfeasance.
SUPPOSED ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Trump claimed ‘‘a colossal reduction in il-
legal border crossings.’’
Facts First: While there has been a reduc-
tion since May, it is only a reduction from
the high point of the Trump era; the total
number of people apprehended at the south-
west border, a proxy measure for the number
of actual crossings, has been higher under
Trump than it was in the late Obama era.
Trump boasted of the US ‘‘becoming the
world’s top energy producer.’’
Facts First: The US became the world’s
top energy producer in 2012, according to the
government’s Energy Information Adminis-
tration—under Obama, whom Trump has re-
peatedly accused of perpetrating a ‘‘war on
American energy.’’
Trump claimed ‘‘a completely reformed VA
with Choice and Accountability for our great
veterans.’’
Facts First: The Veterans Choice program
was signed into law by Obama in 2014. Trump
signed a law in 2018 to expand and modify the
Choice program, the VA MISSION Act, but
he did not create Choice.
Trump touted ‘‘the building of the South-
ern Border Wall.’’
Facts First: As of December 6, the date of
the latest official update from Customs and
Border Protection, no miles of border wall
had been constructed where barriers did not
previously exist. (Construction had started
on some new barriers, the government said.)
Trump has argued that the replacement of
old barriers with newer barriers should count
as the building of his wall; as of December 6,
90 miles of replacement barriers had been
erected.

Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD).
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, I rise on this solemn occasion as we,
the House of Representatives, exercise
the power given to us by the United
States Constitution.
The original Constitution was flawed
in some respects, but with respect to
Presidential misconduct, it was unmis-
takable. The Framers knew that Presi-
dents could be corrupt or abusive with
their power so impeachment was writ-
ten into our organic law.
Since taking office nearly 3 years
ago, President Trump has consistently
and intentionally divided this country.
He has consistently encouraged foreign
actors to interfere in our elections. He
has thumbed his nose, Madam Speaker,
at the legislative branch.
Enough is enough. We must protect
our Constitution, our democracy. I will
vote today to prefer serious charges
against President Trump and deliver
the charges to the Senate for trial, a
place where President Trump can de-
fend himself and attempt, if he choos-
es, to convince the Senate and the
American people that his conduct does
not violate the Constitution.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Indiana
(Mr. BAIRD), my good friend, a distin-
guished combat veteran for our coun-
try.
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, today
marks a sad day for America. Instead
of getting to work to solve the issues of
our time, the House Democrats have
decided to try to discredit President
Trump and undo the results of the 2016
election.
The facts here are clear. The Presi-
dent did not commit any crimes. He did
not break any laws. And there was no
quid pro quo.
This has been a secretive, mis-
directed process from the very begin-
ning, and the American people see
right through it.
I look forward to voting against this
impeachment charade and getting back
to work to support the efforts of Presi-
dent Trump to continue growing our
economy, creating jobs, and improving
the lives of all Americans.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE).
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, this is the
fourth impeachment proceeding
against an American President and the
most serious.
The President committed numerous
crimes, threatening the national secu-
rity.
Ultimately, the matter before us
today is not a question of fact, for the
evidence is undisputed, nor is it a ques-
tion of law, as the Constitution is
clear.
The heart of the matter is this: Will
Members of this House have the cour-
age to choose fidelity to the Constitu-
tion over loyalty to their political
party?
For the sake of our Constitution and
our country, for Americans today and
tomorrow, I urge all Members to sum-
mon the courage to uphold the rule of
law and vote ‘‘yes.’’
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentleman from Missouri (Mr. CLAY).
Mr. CLAY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to hold Donald John Trump ac-
countable for his repeated abuse of
power, his deliberate obstruction of the
House’s constitutionally mandated
oversight responsibilities, and his un-
precedented misuse of the Presidency
to weaken the separation of powers and
subvert our Constitution by dangling
$391 million in congressionally appro-
priated tax dollars over the head of an
embattled ally in order to coerce a
fraudulent investigation into a poten-
tial political opponent.
b 1115
Our Founders feared a lawless, amor-
al President would willfully put na-
tional security at risk for his own per-
sonal gain.
In 1974, Republicans made it clear
that their ultimate loyalty was not to
one man, but to upholding the Con-
stitution. Today, the uncontested evi-
dence shows Donald Trump violated his
oath of office. My friends on both sides
of the aisle can either defend him or
defend the Constitution. History will
not permit you to do both.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Madam Speaker, before I begin my
formal remarks in closing, I want to
say one thing for the record.
I have great respect for all of my
friends on the other side of the aisle,
and I am sure they are voting their
convictions; so when I vote mine,
please don’t imply I am doing it for my
political party. I am doing it because it
is what I believe is right. I do believe I
can defend both the President and the
Constitution of the United States, and
I think that is exactly what I am
doing.
Madam Speaker, I cannot oppose this
rule strongly enough. The process we
saw leading up to it today was a com-
plete charade. It was a closed process,
an unfair process, and a rushed process,
and it could only have ever had one
logical, predetermined ending.
Throughout it all, the majority
trampled on minority rights: They re-
fused to call witnesses with relevant,
firsthand knowledge; they relied on
hearsay news reports to make their
case; they denied Republicans the right
to hold a minority hearing day; and
they refused the President of the
United States his due process rights in
the committee that was actually con-
ducting the impeachment process and
investigating him.
In the end, what was the result? Arti-
cles of Impeachment based on an event
that never happened; a purported quid
pro quo that did not exist; aid that was
allegedly withheld that, in reality, was
never withheld at all; and a narrative
of intent based on nothing more than
fantasy.
Madam Speaker, we deserve better
than this. Impeachment is the most
consequential act the House of Rep-
resentatives can undertake. It must
not and cannot be based on a flawed
process. It cannot come at the expense
of minority rights or due process to the
accused. It cannot be based on a ven-
detta against the President that the
majority has pursued since the day he
was elected, and it cannot be based on
nothing more than spin and hearsay. I
oppose this rule, and I opposed the
flawed and unfair process.
Madam Speaker, it is a very solemn
vote that all of us will cast.
I want to end by, number one, thank-
ing my good friend, the chairman of
the Rules Committee, for conducting
the kind of hearing he conducted yes-
terday; but I also want to underscore,
again, that we are very violently op-
posed to the process and very strongly
opposed to the rule. We think this is a
charade and has been very unfair.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous
question, ‘‘no’’ on the rule, ‘‘no’’ on the

underlying measure, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Madam Speaker, let me thank my
friend, Mr. COLE, for his kind words,
and I appreciate his leadership on the
Rules Committee and the fact that he
respects this institution.
But, Madam Speaker, let me say
again what happened here: The Presi-
dent withheld congressionally approved
military aid to a country under siege
to extract a personal, political favor.
That is a cold, hard fact.
The question before us comes down
to this: Should a President be allowed
to ask a foreign nation to interfere in
an American election?
I remember my first political experi-
ence as a middle schooler in 1972, leav-
ing leaflets at the homes of potential
voters urging them to support George
McGovern for President—no relation,
by the way. I remember what an honor
it was to ask people to support him,
even though I was too young to vote
myself, and what a privilege it was
later in life to ask voters for their sup-
port in my own campaigns.
I have been part of winning cam-
paigns, and I have been part of losing
ones, too. People who I thought would
be great Presidents, like Senator
McGovern, were never given that
chance. Make no mistake: I was dis-
appointed, but I accepted it.
I would take losing an election any
day of the week when the American
people render that verdict, but I will
never be okay if other nations decide
our leaders for us. The President of the
United States is rolling out the wel-
come mat for that kind of foreign in-
terference.
To my Republican friends: Imagine
any Democratic President sitting in
the Oval Office—President Obama,
President Clinton, any of them. Would
your answer here still be the same? No
one should be allowed to use the pow-
ers of the Presidency to undermine our
elections, period.
This isn’t about siding with your
team. I didn’t swear an oath to defend
a political party. I took an oath to up-
hold the Constitution of the United
States of America. And when I vote
‘‘yes’’ on this rule and the underlying
articles, my conscience will be clear.
I ask all of my colleagues to search
their souls before casting their votes. I
ask them all to stand up for our democ-
racy, to stand up for our Constitution.
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote
on the rule and the previous question.
The material previously referred to
by Mr. COLE is as follows:
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 767
Notwithstanding the first section of this
resolution, the House shall not proceed to
consideration of H. Res. 755, impeaching
Donald John Trump, President of the United
States, for high crimes and misdemeanors,
until such time as the Chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee notifies the
House that:
(a) All evidence in possession of Chairman
Schiff of the House Permanent Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence has been made avail-
able to the House Judiciary Committee.
(b) All members of the House Judiciary
Committee have been given the opportunity
to ask questions of the Chairman of the
House Permanent Select Committee on In-
telligence with regards to his report titled
‘‘The Trump-Ukraine Impeachment Inquiry
Report.’’
(c) All underlying, unclassified, evidence
used to create the report described in sub-
section (b) has been made available to the
public.
(d) Minority members of the House Judici-
ary Committee have received their right to a
minority hearing day.
(e) Minority witnesses requested by Rank-
ing Member Nunes at the House Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence and Rank-
ing Member Collins at the House Judiciary
Committee are called and allowed to be
heard in accordance with H. Res. 660.
(f) Subpoenas requested by Ranking Mem-
ber Nunes at the House Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence pursuant to H.
Res. 660 are issued and enforced.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time, and
I move the previous question on the
resolution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on ordering the previous
question.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, on that I
demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair
will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum
time for any electronic vote on the
question of adoption of the resolution.
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 229, nays

So the resolution was agreed to.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, had I been

No. 694.
f
IMPEACHING DONALD JOHN
TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES, FOR HIGH
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 767, the House
will proceed to the immediate consid-
eration of House Resolution 755.
The Clerk will report the resolution.
The Clerk read the resolution as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 755
Resolved, That Donald John Trump, President
of the United States, is impeached for high
crimes and misdemeanors and that the following
articles of impeachment be exhibited to the
United States Senate:
Articles of impeachment exhibited by the
House of Representatives of the United States of
America in the name of itself and of the people
of the United States of America, against Donald
John Trump, President of the United States of
America, in maintenance and support of its im-
peachment against him for high crimes and mis-
demeanors.
ARTICLE I: ABUSE OF POWER
The Constitution provides that the House of
Representatives ‘‘shall have the sole Power of
Impeachment’’ and that the President ‘‘shall be
removed from Office on Impeachment for, and
Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high
Crimes and Misdemeanors’’. In his conduct of
the office of President of the United States—and
in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully
to execute the office of President of the United
States and, to the best of his ability, preserve,
protect, and defend the Constitution of the
United States, and in violation of his constitu-
tional duty to take care that the laws be faith-
fully executed—Donald J. Trump has abused the
powers of the Presidency, in that:
Using the powers of his high office, President
Trump solicited the interference of a foreign
government, Ukraine, in the 2020 United States
Presidential election. He did so through a
scheme or course of conduct that included solic-
iting the Government of Ukraine to publicly an-
nounce investigations that would benefit his re-
election, harm the election prospects of a polit-
ical opponent, and influence the 2020 United
States Presidential election to his advantage.
President Trump also sought to pressure the
Government of Ukraine to take these steps by
conditioning official United States Government
acts of significant value to Ukraine on its public
announcement of the investigations. President
Trump engaged in this scheme or course of con-
duct for corrupt purposes in pursuit of personal
political benefit. In so doing, President Trump
used the powers of the Presidency in a manner
that compromised the national security of the
United States and undermined the integrity of
the United States democratic process. He thus
ignored and injured the interests of the Nation.
President Trump engaged in this scheme or
course of conduct through the following means:
(1) President Trump—acting both directly and
through his agents within and outside the
United States Government—corruptly solicited
the Government of Ukraine to publicly an-
nounce investigations into—

HOUSE
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H12131
December 18, 2019
(A) a political opponent, former Vice Presi-
dent Joseph R. Biden, Jr.; and
(B) a discredited theory promoted by Russia
alleging that Ukraine—rather than Russia—
interfered in the 2016 United States Presidential
election.
(2) With the same corrupt motives, President
Trump—acting both directly and through his
agents within and outside the United States
Government—conditioned two official acts on
the public announcements that he had re-
quested—
(A) the release of $391 million of United States
taxpayer funds that Congress had appropriated
on a bipartisan basis for the purpose of pro-
viding vital military and security assistance to
Ukraine to oppose Russian aggression and
which President Trump had ordered suspended;
and
(B) a head of state meeting at the White
House, which the President of Ukraine sought
to demonstrate continued United States support
for the Government of Ukraine in the face of
Russian aggression.
(3) Faced with the public revelation of his ac-
tions, President Trump ultimately released the
military and security assistance to the Govern-
ment of Ukraine, but has persisted in openly
and corruptly urging and soliciting Ukraine to
undertake investigations for his personal polit-
ical benefit.
These actions were consistent with President
Trump’s previous invitations of foreign inter-
ference in United States elections.
In all of this, President Trump abused the
powers of the Presidency by ignoring and injur-
ing national security and other vital national
interests to obtain an improper personal polit-
ical benefit. He has also betrayed the Nation by
abusing his high office to enlist a foreign power
in corrupting democratic elections.
Wherefore President Trump, by such conduct,
has demonstrated that he will remain a threat
to national security and the Constitution if al-
lowed to remain in office, and has acted in a
manner grossly incompatible with self-govern-
ance and the rule of law. President Trump thus
warrants impeachment and trial, removal from
office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy
any office of honor, trust, or profit under the
United States.
ARTICLE II: OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS
The Constitution provides that the House of
Representatives ‘‘shall have the sole Power of
Impeachment’’ and that the President ‘‘shall be
removed from Office on Impeachment for, and
Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high
Crimes and Misdemeanors’’. In his conduct of
the office of President of the United States—and
in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully
to execute the office of President of the United
States and, to the best of his ability, preserve,
protect, and defend the Constitution of the
United States, and in violation of his constitu-
tional duty to take care that the laws be faith-
fully executed—Donald J. Trump has directed
the unprecedented, categorical, and indiscrimi-
nate defiance of subpoenas issued by the House
of Representatives pursuant to its ‘‘sole Power
of Impeachment’’. President Trump has abused
the powers of the Presidency in a manner offen-
sive to, and subversive of, the Constitution, in
that:
The House of Representatives has engaged in
an impeachment inquiry focused on President
Trump’s corrupt solicitation of the Government
of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 United States
Presidential election. As part of this impeach-
ment inquiry, the Committees undertaking the
investigation served subpoenas seeking docu-
ments and testimony deemed vital to the inquiry
from various Executive Branch agencies and of-
fices, and current and former officials.
In response, without lawful cause or excuse,
President Trump directed Executive Branch
agencies, offices, and officials not to comply
with those subpoenas. President Trump thus
interposed the powers of the Presidency against
the lawful subpoenas of the House of Represent-
atives, and assumed to himself functions and
judgments necessary to the exercise of the ‘‘sole
Power of Impeachment’’ vested by the Constitu-
tion in the House of Representatives.
President Trump abused the powers of his
high office through the following means:
(1) Directing the White House to defy a lawful
subpoena by withholding the production of doc-
uments sought therein by the Committees.
(2) Directing other Executive Branch agencies
and offices to defy lawful subpoenas and with-
hold the production of documents and records
from the Committees—in response to which the
Department of State, Office of Management and
Budget, Department of Energy, and Department
of Defense refused to produce a single document
or record.
(3) Directing current and former Executive
Branch officials not to cooperate with the Com-
mittees—in response to which nine Administra-
tion officials defied subpoenas for testimony,
namely John Michael ‘‘Mick’’ Mulvaney, Robert
B. Blair, John A. Eisenberg, Michael Ellis, Pres-
ton Wells Griffith, Russell T. Vought, Michael
Duffey, Brian McCormack, and T. Ulrich
Brechbuhl.
These actions were consistent with President
Trump’s previous efforts to undermine United
States Government investigations into foreign
interference in United States elections.
Through these actions, President Trump
sought to arrogate to himself the right to deter-
mine the propriety, scope, and nature of an im-
peachment inquiry into his own conduct, as well
as the unilateral prerogative to deny any and
all information to the House of Representatives
in the exercise of its ‘‘sole Power of Impeach-
ment’’. In the history of the Republic, no Presi-
dent has ever ordered the complete defiance of
an impeachment inquiry or sought to obstruct
and impede so comprehensively the ability of the
House of Representatives to investigate ‘‘high
Crimes and Misdemeanors’’. This abuse of office
served to cover up the President’s own repeated
misconduct and to seize and control the power
of impeachment—and thus to nullify a vital
constitutional safeguard vested solely in the
House of Representatives.
In all of this, President Trump has acted in a
manner contrary to his trust as President and
subversive of constitutional government, to the
great prejudice of the cause of law and justice,
and to the manifest injury of the people of the
United States.
Wherefore, President Trump, by such conduct,
has demonstrated that he will remain a threat
to the Constitution if allowed to remain in of-
fice, and has acted in a manner grossly incom-
patible with self-governance and the rule of
law. President Trump thus warrants impeach-
ment and trial, removal from office, and dis-
qualification to hold and enjoy any office of
honor, trust, or profit under the United States.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 767, the
amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute recommended by the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary is adopted. The
resolution shall be debatable for 6
hours equally divided and controlled by
the chair and ranking member of the
Committee on the Judiciary or their
respective designees.
The gentleman from New York (Mr.
NADLER) and the gentleman from Geor-

The Chair recognizes the gentleman

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H. Res. 755.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. PELOSI), the dis-
tinguished Speaker of the House.
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding and
for his tremendous leadership in help-
ing us honor the Constitution of the
United States.
I also extend my gratitude to Chair-
man SCHIFF, who will be presiding later
in the day.
Madam Speaker, this morning and
every morning when we come together,
Members rise and pledge allegiance to
the flag. Every day, all across America,
children in school, members of the
military, officials, and those civilly en-
gaged, also pledge allegiance to the
flag.
Let us recall what that pledge says:
‘‘I pledge allegiance to the flag of the
United States of America, and to the
Republic for which it stands, one na-
tion under God, indivisible, with lib-
erty and justice for all.’’
‘‘The Republic for which it stands’’ is
what we are here to talk about today:
‘‘a republic, if we can keep it.’’
We gather today, under the dome of
this temple of democracy, to exercise
one of the most solemn powers that
this body can take: the impeachment
of the President of the United States.
No Member, regardless of party or
politics, comes to Congress to impeach
a President; but every one of us, as our
first act as a Member of Congress,
stood on this historic House floor, be-
fore our beautiful American flag, and
raised our hands in this sacred oath: ‘‘I
do solemnly swear that I will support
and defend the Constitution of the
United States against all enemies, for-
eign and domestic. . . . So help me
God.’’
For 230 years, Members have taken
that sacred oath, which makes us
custodians of the Constitution.
When our Founders declared inde-
pendence and established our new Na-
tion, they crafted a system of govern-
ment unlike any ever seen before: a re-
public, starting with the sacred words,
‘‘We the People.’’
For centuries, Americans have
fought—and died—to defend democracy
for the people. But, very sadly, now,
our Founders’ vision of a republic is
under threat from actions from the
White House. That is why, today, as
Speaker of the House, I solemnly and
sadly open the debate on the impeach-
ment of the President of the United
States.
If we do not act now, we would be
derelict in our duty. It is tragic that
the President’s reckless actions make
impeachment necessary.
He gave us no choice.
What we are discussing today is the
established fact that the President vio-
lated the Constitution.

H12132 December 18, 2019
It is a matter of fact that the Presi-
dent is an ongoing threat to our na-
tional security and the integrity of our
elections: the basis of our democracy.
Hundreds of historians, legal schol-
ars, and former prosecutors—regardless
of party—have stated that the Presi-
dent committed impeachable offenses.
Since today is a national civics les-
son, though a sad one, I submit these
documents for the RECORD and com-
mend them for students to study.
450+ FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTORS
STATEMENT ON MUELLER REPORT
May 6
We are former federal prosecutors. We
served under both Republican and Demo-
cratic administrations at different levels of
the federal system: as line attorneys, super-
visors, special prosecutors, United States At-
torneys, and senior officials at the Depart-
ment of Justice. The offices in which we
served were small, medium, and large; urban,
suburban, and rural; and located in all parts
of our country.
Each of us believes that the conduct of
President Trump described in Special Coun-
sel Robert Mueller’s report would, in the
case of any other person not covered by the
Office of Legal Counsel policy against indict-
ing a sitting President, result in multiple
felony charges for obstruction of justice.
The Mueller report describes several acts
that satisfy all of the elements for an ob-
struction charge: conduct that obstructed or
attempted to obstruct the truthfinding proc-
ess, as to which the evidence of corrupt in-
tent and connection to pending proceedings
is overwhelming. These include:
The President’s efforts to fire Mueller and
to falsify evidence about that effort;
The President’s efforts to limit the scope
of Mueller’s investigation to exclude his con-
duct; and
The President’s efforts to prevent wit-
nesses from cooperating with investigators
probing him and his campaign.
ATTEMPTS TO FIRE MUELLER AND THEN CREATE
FALSE EVIDENCE
Despite being advised by then-White House
Counsel Don McGahn that he could face legal
jeopardy for doing so, Trump directed
McGahn on multiple occasions to fire
Mueller or to gin up false conflicts of inter-
est as a pretext for getting rid of the Special
Counsel. When these acts began to come into
public view, Trump made ‘‘repeated efforts
to have McGahn deny the story’’—going so
far as to tell McGahn to write a letter ‘‘for
our files’’ falsely denying that Trump had di-
rected Mueller’s termination.
Firing Mueller would have seriously im-
peded the investigation of the President and
his associates—obstruction in its most lit-
eral sense. Directing the creation of false
government records in order to prevent or
discredit truthful testimony is similarly un-
lawful. The Special Counsel’s report states:
‘‘Substantial evidence indicates that in re-
peatedly urging McGahn to dispute that he
was ordered to have the Special Counsel ter-
minated, the President acted for the purpose
of influencing McGahn’s account in order to
deflect or prevent scrutiny of the President’s
conduct toward the investigation.’’
ATTEMPTS TO LIMIT THE MUELLER
INVESTIGATION
The report describes multiple efforts by
the president to curtail the scope of the Spe-
cial Counsel’s investigation.
First, the President repeatedly pressured
then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to re-
verse his legally-mandated decision to recuse
himself from the investigation. The Presi-
dent’s stated reason was that he wanted an
attorney general who would ‘‘protect’’ him,
including from the Special Counsel inves-
tigation. He also directed then-White House
Chief of Staff Reince Priebus to fire Sessions
and Priebus refused.
Second, after McGahn told the President
that he could not contact Sessions himself to
discuss the investigation, Trump went out-
side the White House, instructing his former
campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, to
carry a demand to Sessions to direct Mueller
to confine his investigation to future elec-
tions. Lewandowski tried and failed to con-
tact Sessions in private. After a second
meeting with Trump, Lewandowski passed
Trump’s message to senior White House offi-
cial Rick Dearborn, who Lewandowski
thought would be a better messenger because
of his prior relationship with Sessions. Dear-
born did not pass along Trump’s message. As
the report explains, ‘‘[s]ubstantial evidence
indicates that the President’s effort to have
Sessions limit the scope of the Special Coun-
sel’s investigation to future election inter-
ference was intended to prevent further in-
vestigative scrutiny of the President’s and
his campaign’s conduct’’—in other words,
the President employed a private citizen to
try to get the Attorney General to limit the
scope of an ongoing investigation into the
President and his associates.
All of this conduct—trying to control and
impede the investigation against the Presi-
dent by leveraging his authority over oth-
ers—is similar to conduct we have seen
charged against other public officials and
people in powerful positions.
WITNESS TAMPERING AND INTIMIDATION
The Special Counsel’s report establishes
that the President tried to influence the de-
cisions of both Michael Cohen and Paul
Manafort with regard to cooperating with in-
vestigators. Some of this tampering and in-
timidation, including the dangling of par-
dons, was done in plain sight via tweets and
public statements; other such behavior was
done via private messages through private
attorneys, such as Trump counsel Rudy
Giuliani’s message to Cohen’s lawyer that
Cohen should ‘‘[s]leep well tonight[], you
have friends in high places.’’
Of course, these aren’t the only acts of po-
tential obstruction detailed by the Special
Counsel. It would be well within the purview
of normal prosecutorial judgment also to
charge other acts detailed in the report.
We emphasize that these are not matters
of close professional judgment. Of course,
there are potential defenses or arguments
that could be raised in response to an indict-
ment of the nature we describe here. In our
system, every accused person is presumed in-
nocent and it is always the government’s
burden to prove its case beyond a reasonable
doubt. But, to look at these facts and say
that a prosecutor could not probably sustain
a conviction for obstruction of justice—the
standard set out in Principles of Federal
Prosecution—runs counter to logic and our
experience.
As former federal prosecutors, we recog-
nize that prosecuting obstruction of justice
cases is critical because unchecked obstruc-
tion—which allows intentional interference
with criminal investigations to go
unpunished—puts our whole system of jus-
tice at risk. We believe strongly that, but for
the OLC memo, the overwhelming weight of
professional judgment would come down in
favor of prosecution for the conduct outlined
in the Mueller Report.

LETTER TO CONGRESS FROM LEGAL SCHOLARS
Dec. 6
We, the undersigned legal scholars, have
concluded that President Trump engaged in
impeachable conduct.
We do not reach this conclusion lightly.
The Founders did not make impeachment
available for disagreements over policy, even
profound ones, nor for extreme distaste for
the manner in which the President executes
his office. Only ‘‘Treason, Bribery, or other
high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’ warrant im-
peachment. But there is overwhelming evi-
dence that President Trump betrayed his
oath of office by seeking to use presidential
power to pressure a foreign government to
help him distort an American election, for
his personal and political benefit, at the di-
rect expense of national security interests as
determined by Congress. His conduct is pre-
cisely the type of threat to our democracy
that the Founders feared when they included
the remedy of impeachment in the Constitu-
tion.
We take no position on whether the Presi-
dent committed a crime. But conduct need
not be criminal to be impeachable. The
standard here is constitutional; it does not
depend on what Congress has chosen to crim-
inalize.
Impeachment is a remedy for grave abuses
of the public trust. The two specific bases for
impeachment named in the Constitution—
treason and bribery—involve such abuses be-
cause they include conduct undertaken not
in the ‘‘faithful execution’’ of public office
that the Constitution requires, but instead
for personal gain (bribery) or to benefit a for-
eign enemy (treason).
Impeachment is an especially essential
remedy for conduct that corrupts elections.
The primary check on presidents is political:
if a president behaves poorly, voters can pun-
ish him or his party at the polls. A president
who corrupts the system of elections seeks
to place himself beyond the reach of this po-
litical check. At the Constitutional Conven-
tion, George Mason described impeachable
offenses as ‘‘attempts to subvert the con-
stitution.’’ Corrupting elections subverts the
process by which the Constitution makes the
president democratically accountable. Put
simply, if a President cheats in his effort at
re-election, trusting the democratic process
to serve as a check through that election is
no remedy at all. That is what impeachment
is for.
Moreover, the Founders were keenly con-
cerned with the possibility of corruption in
the president’s relationships with foreign
governments. That is why they prohibited
the president from accepting anything of
value from foreign governments without
Congress’s consent. The same concern drove
their thinking on impeachment. James
Madison noted that Congress must be able to
remove the president between elections lest
there be no remedy if a president betrayed
the public trust in dealings with foreign pow-
ers.
In light of these considerations, over-
whelming evidence made public to date
forces us to conclude that President Trump
engaged in impeachable conduct. To mention
only a few of those facts: William B. Taylor,
who leads the U.S. embassy in Ukraine, tes-
tified that President Trump directed the
withholding of hundreds of millions of dol-
lars in military aid for Ukraine in its strug-
gle against Russia—aid that Congress deter-
mined to be in the U.S. national security in-
terest—until Ukraine announced investiga-
tions that would aid the President’s re-elec-
tion campaign. Ambassador Gordon

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H12133
December 18, 2019
Sondland testified that the President made a
White House visit for the Ukrainian presi-
dent conditional on public announcement of
those investigations. In a phone call with the
Ukrainian president, President Trump asked
for a ‘‘favor’’ in the form of a foreign govern-
ment investigation of a U.S. citizen who is
his political rival. President Trump and his
Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney made public
statements confirming this use of govern-
mental power to solicit investigations that
would aid the President’s personal political
interests. The President made clear that his
private attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was central
to efforts to spur Ukrainian investigations,
and Mr. Giuliani confirmed that his efforts
were in service of President Trump’s private
interests.
Ultimately, whether to impeach the Presi-
dent and remove him from office depends on
judgments that the Constitution leaves to
Congress. But if the House of Representa-
tives impeached the President for the con-
duct described here and the Senate voted to
remove him, they would be acting well with-
in their constitutional powers. Whether
President Trump’s conduct is classified as
bribery, as a high crime or misdemeanor, or
as both, it is clearly impeachable under our
Constitution.
700+ HISTORIANS’ STATEMENT ON THE
IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP
Dec. 16
We are American historians devoted to
studying our nation’s past who have con-
cluded that Donald J. Trump has violated his
oath to ‘‘faithfully execute the Office of
President of the United States’’ and to ‘‘pre-
serve, protect and defend the Constitution of
the United States.’’ His ‘‘attempts to subvert
the Constitution,’’ as George Mason de-
scribed impeachable offenses at the Con-
stitutional Convention in 1787, urgently and
justly require his impeachment.
President Trump’s numerous and flagrant
abuses of power are precisely what the Fram-
ers had in mind as grounds for impeaching
and removing a president. Among those most
hurtful to the Constitution have been his at-
tempts to coerce the country of Ukraine,
under attack from Russia, an adversary
power to the United States, by withholding
essential military assistance in exchange for
the fabrication and legitimization of false in-
formation in order to advance his own re-
election.
President Trump’s lawless obstruction of
the House of Representatives, which is right-
ly seeking documents and witness testimony
in pursuit of its constitutionally-mandated
oversight role, has demonstrated brazen con-
tempt for representative government. So
have his attempts to justify that obstruction
on the grounds that the executive enjoys ab-
solute immunity, a fictitious doctrine that,
if tolerated, would turn the president into an
elected monarch above the law.
As Alexander Hamilton wrote in The Fed-
eralist, impeachment was designed to deal
with ‘‘the misconduct of public men’’ which
involves ‘‘the abuse or violation of some pub-
lic trust.’’ Collectively, the President’s of-
fenses, including his dereliction in pro-
tecting the integrity of the 2020 election
from Russian disinformation and renewed in-
terference, arouse once again the Framers’
most profound fears that powerful members
of government would become, in Hamilton’s
words, ‘‘the mercenary instruments of for-
eign corruption.’’
It is our considered judgment that if Presi-
dent Trump’s misconduct does not rise to
the level of impeachment, then virtually
nothing does.
Hamilton understood, as he wrote in 1792,
that the republic remained vulnerable to the
rise of an unscrupulous demagogue, ‘‘unprin-
cipled in private life, desperate in his for-
tune, bold in his temper, possessed of consid-
erable talents . . . despotic in his ordinary
demeanour.’’ That demagogue, Hamilton
said, could easily enough manage ‘‘to mount
the hobby horse of popularity—to join in the
cry of danger to liberty—to take every op-
portunity of embarrassing the General Gov-
ernment & bringing it under suspicion—to
flatter and fall in with all the non sense of
the zealots of the day.’’ Such a figure, Ham-
ilton wrote, would ‘‘throw things into confu-
sion that he may ‘ride the storm and direct
the whirlwind.’ ’’
President Trump’s actions committed both
before and during the House investigations
fit Hamilton’s description and manifest utter
and deliberate scorn for the rule of law and
‘‘repeated injuries’’ to constitutional democ-
racy. That disregard continues and it con-
stitutes a clear and present danger to the
Constitution. We therefore strongly urge the
House of Representatives to impeach the
President.
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, what
we are discussing today is the estab-
lished fact that the President, again,
violated the Constitution.
It is a matter of fact that the Presi-
dent is, again, an ongoing threat to our
national security. And the testimony
of decorated war heroes, distinguished
diplomats, and patriotic, career public
servants—some the President’s own ap-
pointees—over the past weeks have
told us this.
The President used the power of his
public office to obtain an improper per-
sonal, political benefit at the expense
of America’s national security. When
the President weakens a democratic
ally that is advancing American secu-
rity interests by fighting an American
adversary, the President weakens
America.
This abuse of power also jeopardizes
the integrity of our elections. All
Americans agree that American voters
should choose our President, not some
foreign government.
The Founders understood that it is
profoundly corrosive for our democracy
for a President to invite interference in
our elections.
As George Washington, our Nation’s
patriarch, under whose gaze we stand
today, warned: ‘‘History and experience
prove that foreign influence is one of
the most baneful foes of republican
government’’—George Washington.
Sadly, the American people have wit-
nessed further wrongs of the President,
which necessitate the second Article of
Impeachment: obstruction of Congress.
When the President’s wrongdoing was
revealed, he launched an unprece-
dented, indiscriminate, and categorical
campaign of defiance and obstruction.
Never before in the history of our Na-
tion have we seen a President declare—
and act as if—he is above the law.
The President even goes so far as to
say and act on this absurdity when he
says: ‘‘Article II says I can do whatever
I want.’’
No, it doesn’t.
That recklessness is a profound viola-
tion of the Constitution and our Re-
public, which endure because of our
system of separation of powers: three
coequal branches, each a check and
balance on the others—‘‘a republic,’’
again, ‘‘if we can keep it.’’
b 1215
The Founders’ great fear of a rogue
or corrupt President is the very reason
why they enshrined impeachment in
the Constitution.
As one Founder, William Davie of
North Carolina, warned, unless the
Constitution contained an impeach-
ment provision, a President might
spare no efforts or means whatever to
get himself reelected.
Another Founder, George Mason, in-
sisted that the President who procured
his appointment in the first instance
through improper and corrupt acts
might repeat his guilt and return to
power.
We in Congress, Article I, the legisla-
tive branch, must stand up and make
clear to the American people and to all
people who this body still stands by the
principles enshrined in the Constitu-
tion and defended by generations of
Americans.
Last week, in observance of the 75th
anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge,
Members traveled to that hallowed
ground to express our gratitude to the
heroes who sacrificed everything to se-
cure victory of freedom over tyranny,
not just for America but for the world.
The veterans of that battle, who are in
their nineties, told us how, after the
war was won, the Europeans whom
they liberated would ask: Why did you
risk—you don’t know us—and give your
lives to save us? We are not Americans.
Our men would say: We came here to
fight for you not because you are
Americans but because we are Ameri-
cans.
As our beloved Elijah Cummings, our
Oversight Committee chair, our North
Star, said when he announced his sup-
port of this action: ‘‘When the history
books are written about this tumul-
tuous era, I want them to show that I
was among those in the House of Rep-
resentatives who stood up to lawless-
ness and tyranny.’’
He also said, almost prophetically:
When we are dancing with the angels, the
question will be: What did we do to make
sure we kept our democracy intact?
Elijah has since passed on. Now, he is
dancing with the angels.
I know that he and all of us here are
very proud of the moral courage of
Members who want to honor the vision
of our Founders for a republic, the sac-
rifice of our men and women in uni-
form to defend it, and the aspirations
of our children to live freely within it.
Today, we are here to defend democ-
racy for the people. May God bless
America.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Madam Speaker, we are here today to
enter into a debate that should sur-
prise no one. This has not been a sur-
prise, and it is not even something that
we would not have thought about.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H12134 December 18, 2019
From the very moment that the major-
ity party in this House won, the inevi-
tability that we would be here today
was only a matter of what date they
would schedule it, nothing else.
In fact, how it even began to look
even further was, on September 24, the
Speaker announced an impeachment
inquiry even before seeing the call
transcript that we are going to hear so
much about today.
You know, it is not about what this
body can do and its constitutional
oath, and there has been a lot of ‘‘con-
stitutional’’ and ‘‘Founders’’ thrown
around and will be all day today. But
there is one thing that I will mention
all along, and that is, also, the Found-
ers were very concerned about a par-
tisan impeachment in which politics or
the majority, who have their strength,
can do what they want to do, regard-
less of any facts.
In fact, I have said it before, and I
will say it again, I do not believe, no
matter what was said today and even
what has been said—this is not a sol-
emn occasion. When you go looking for
something for 3 years, and especially
this year since January, you ought to
be excited when you find it, but they
can’t because I know what has now
happened. It took me till last night,
but I was thinking about it. Why do we
keep calling this a solemn occasion
when you have been wanting to do this
ever since the gentleman was elected?
The President came forward and did
what he saw fit for the American peo-
ple, but yet they wanted to impeach
him. And it hit me. Now I know.
The reason they wanted to is now
they are realizing what I told them and
have been telling them for the last few
weeks, that the clock and the calendar
are terrible masters. The clock and the
calendar are terrible masters. They do
not care about anything except getting
the time done and the calendar fixed.
They do not care about facts. They do
not care about time. And one day, the
clock and the calendar will hang along
this body in a very detrimental way.
How do I know this? Because one of
our Members, Ms. TLAIB, said on the
night she was sworn in: We are going to
impeach.
Well, you know the rest. In May 2019,
AL GREEN said: I am concerned if we
don’t impeach this President, he will
get reelected.
That is probably the most prescient
thing said by the majority in the last
year is that they said: We can’t beat
him if we don’t impeach him.
There is a reason behind the im-
peachment. Even Speaker PELOSI said
it would be dangerous to leave it to
voters to determine whether President
Trump stays in office. Really? After we
just said the Pledge of Allegiance, we
go back to the Speaker’s own words
and she said it would be dangerous to
leave it to the voters.
I will tell you right now, Madam
Speaker, we on the Republican side
have no problem taking our case to the
majority and to the people of this
country because they elected Donald
Trump, and it is a matter for the vot-
ers, not this House, not in this way,
not in the way this is being done. It has
trampled everything this House be-
lieves in.
I said it yesterday, and I believe this
to be true today, I will fight this on
process, which has been deplorable, to
use a word of the majority. It has been
awful.
The calendar and the clock make it
impressive that we actually do it
quickly. We don’t care about rules. We
don’t care about minority hearing
days. We don’t care about giving the
opportunity for witnesses to be called
because the chairman gets to deter-
mine what is relevant. Wow, that is
pretty good. Let the accuser determine
what is relevant to the one being ac-
cused.
The people of America see through
this. The people of America understand
due process, and they understand when
it is being trampled in the people’s
House.
You see, it is also not a matter of
process, which will be discussed today.
It is a matter of actual facts. I will
fight the facts all day long because
what we have found here today is a
President who did not do as being
charged. In fact, they had to go to
abuse of power, this amorphous term
that you are going to hear many argu-
ments about that abuse of power, ex-
cept for one thing, the call itself, the
two parties say no pressure. Nothing
was ever done to get the money. In
fact, they didn’t even know the money
was held.
But there is something that very
much bothers me about the facts.
There were five meetings—we will hear
about those today—in which there was
never a linkage made. There was one
witness who is depended on over 600
times in the majority’s report that, in
the end, after questioned, had to say:
Well, that was my presumption of what
was happening.
You see, this is an impeachment
based on presumption, basically also a
poll-tested impeachment on what actu-
ally sells to the American people.
Today is going to be a lot of things.
What it is not is fair. What it is not is
about the truth. What is true today,
and I just heard it just a moment ago
in the articles themselves where it
said—and the Speaker, I believe, actu-
ally talked about this, that the Presi-
dent weakened a foreign leader.
Do you know what the truth of the
matter is, Madam Speaker? The most
interesting and deplorable thing that I
have heard over the last few weeks is
the actual attack by the majority on
President Zelensky because they real-
ize the whole crux of their case is that
if he was not pressured, their house of
cards falls. By the way, it has already
fallen.
But if we can’t show pressure, then
we either have to call him a liar, a
world leader, or we have to make up
names to call him. That is exactly
what happened in the Judiciary Com-
mittee when a Member of the majority
actually compared him to a battered
wife. That is below the dignity of this
body, to take a world leader and, when
he doesn’t make your case for you, to
belittle him, especially, as is going to
be often said by the majority, that
they are in the middle of a hot war
with Russia.
You see, President Trump actually
did give them offensive weapons. Presi-
dent Trump did nothing wrong. We are
going to talk about that all day long
today.
We went on process, and we went on
facts. Why? Because the American peo-
ple will see through this.
Before I close this first part, I will
have to recognize that even the minor-
ity leader in the Senate recognizes that
the House did not do their job because
he can’t make the case to his own
Members so he is having to ask for wit-
nesses, ask for more time. You see, and
even yesterday, it was sort of funny. I
thought it was hilarious that the mi-
nority leader in the Senate went out
and did a press conference and said:
They denied my witnesses. They denied
my requests.
Well, welcome to the club, Mr. SCHU-
MER. That is exactly what has hap-
pened over here for the last 3 months.
Today, we are going to talk a lot
about impeachment. We are going to
talk a lot about our President. We are
going to talk about two Articles of Im-
peachment, abuse of power because
they can’t actually pin anything of fac-
tual basis on him—the President did
nothing wrong in this issue—and then
they are going to talk about obstruc-
tion of Congress.
You know, obstruction of Congress,
as I have said before, is like petulant
children saying we didn’t get our way
when we didn’t ask the right way, and
we didn’t actually go after it and try to
make a case.
You know why, Madam Speaker? The
clock and the calendar are terrible
masters. The majority will own that
problem today because to the clock and
the calendar, facts don’t matter. The
promises to the base matter, and today
is a promise kept for the majority—not
a surprise, a fact.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, the House of Rep-
resentatives must now consider two
Articles of Impeachment against Presi-
dent Trump. The first article charges
that the President used his public of-
fice to coerce a foreign government
into attacking his political rival. The
second article charges that the Presi-
dent took extreme and unprecedented
steps to obstruct our investigation into
his conduct.
Taken together, the two articles
charge that President Trump placed
his private political interests above our
national security, above our elections,

and above our system of checks and
balances.
After months of investigation, there
can be no serious debate about the evi-
dence at hand. On July 25, when he
spoke to President Zelensky of
Ukraine, President Trump had the
upper hand. The President, through his
agents, had already demanded that
Ukraine announce an investigation of
his political opponents. Ukraine needed
our help, both military aid, which had
been appropriated by Congress because
of our security interests, and an Oval
Office meeting to show the world that
the United States continues to stand
with Ukraine against Russian aggres-
sion.
President Trump should have been
focused on the interests of the Amer-
ican people on that call. Instead, he
prioritized his private political inter-
ests. President Trump asked President
Zelensky for a favor. He wanted
Ukraine to announce two bogus inves-
tigations, one into former Vice Presi-
dent Biden, then his leading opponent
in the 2020 election, and another to ad-
vance a conspiracy theory that
Ukraine, not Russia, attacked our elec-
tions in 2016.
Neither request was premised on any
legitimate national security or foreign
policy interests. One was intended to
help President Trump conceal the
truth about the 2016 election. The other
was intended to help him gain an ad-
vantage in the 2020 election.
After the call, President Trump
ratcheted up the pressure. He deployed
his private attorney and other agents,
some acting far outside the regular
channels of diplomacy, to make his de-
sires clear. There would be no aid and
no meeting until Ukraine announced
the sham investigations.
To our founding generation, abuse of
power was a specific, well-defined of-
fense. A President may not misuse the
powers of the Presidency to obtain an
improper personal benefit. The evi-
dence shows that President Trump did
exactly that.
For this alone, he should be im-
peached. But the first article also iden-
tifies two aggravating factors.
When President Trump conditioned
military aid on a personal favor, he
harmed America’s national security.
When he demanded that a foreign gov-
ernment target his domestic political
rival, he took steps to corrupt our next
election. To the Founders, these of-
fenses clearly merited removal from of-
fice.
The President faces a second Article
of Impeachment for his efforts to ob-
struct our investigation of his mis-
conduct. The Constitution grants the
sole power of impeachment to the
House of Representatives. Within our
system of checks and balances, the
President may not decide for himself
what constitutes a valid impeachment
inquiry, nor may he ignore lawful sub-
poenas or direct others to do so.
Many Presidents, including President
Trump, have asserted privileges and
other objections to specific subpoenas,
but only President Trump has ordered
the categorical defiance of a congres-
sional investigation, the automatic re-
jection of all subpoenas. The President
is not above the law, and he should be
impeached for this, as well.
Congress cannot wait for the next
election to address this misconduct.
President Trump has demonstrated a
clear pattern of wrongdoing. This is
not the first time he has solicited for-
eign interference in an election, has
been exposed, and has attempted to ob-
struct the resulting investigation.
We cannot rely on the next election
as a remedy for Presidential mis-
conduct when the President threatens
the very integrity of that election. He
has shown us he will continue to put
his selfish interests above the good of
the country. We must act without
delay.
By his actions, President Trump has
broken his oath of office. His conduct
continues to undermine our Constitu-
tion and threaten our next election.
His actions warrant his impeachment
and demand his removal from office.
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the

Donald Trump:

Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. SENSEN-
BRENNER).
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Madam
Speaker, I rise in opposition to im-
peaching the President.
The Constitution says that any civil
officer, including the President, may
be impeached for treason, bribery, or
other high crimes and misdemeanors.
Unlike the Nixon and Clinton cases,
there are no allegations that the Presi-
dent has committed a crime.
We have had almost 3 years of non-
stop investigations. We have had the
Mueller report, we have had the Schiff
investigation, we have had the Nadler
investigation, and at no time has there
been any evidence that indicates that
Donald J. Trump violated any criminal
statute of the United States.
So why are we here?
We are here because the majority
caucus, the Democratic Caucus, has
been hijacked by the radical left. They
have wanted to reverse the course of
the 2016 election ever since Donald J.
Trump won that election.
So let’s look at these two phony Ar-
ticles of Impeachment.
First of all, abuse of power. The
phone call in question had the Presi-
dent say, ‘‘our country has been
through a lot. I want you to do us a
favor.’’ Not ‘‘me’’ a favor; ‘‘us’’ a favor.
And there he was referring to our coun-
try, the United States of America, not
a personal political gain.
He was not afraid to let this tran-
script go public, and he released the
transcript almost immediately after
the call.
Now, the second Article of Impeach-
ment, obstruction of Congress, basi-
cally says that, unless the President
gives us everything we want, when we
want it, then he has committed an im-
peachable offense.
That is a bunch of bunk.
Now, the President has certain indi-
vidual and executive privileges by vir-
tue of his office.
Whenever there has been a dispute
between the executive and legislative
branches heretofore, they have gone to
court. The Supreme Court a couple
weeks ago said they would take juris-
diction over deciding whether the
President has to comply with one sub-
poena relating to his tax returns.
Now, here, the Democrats have been
bent to impeach the President of the
United States before the court decides
this. This means that there is a rush
job to do this.
Why is there a rush job? Because
they want to influence the 2020 elec-
tions.
They have spent 3 years doing this;
they have spent millions of taxpayer
dollars, including the Mueller report,
putting together this impeachment;
and they also have had this Congress
wrapped around impeachment and not
doing their jobs until the dam broke
this week.

H12136 December 18, 2019
Stop this charade. Vote ‘‘no.’’
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin knows full well
the President asserted no privileges
here. He simply ordered complete defi-
ance of the impeachment inquiry.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.
SCANLON).
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Chairman NADLER for his leadership as
we navigate this challenging time, not
just for our committee and Congress,
but for our country.
It is with profound sadness that I
stand here today in support of these
Articles of Impeachment.
President Trump’s behavior is ex-
actly what our Founders feared most.
They knew that with the awesome
power of the Presidency came the risk
of a President abusing that power for
personal gain.
They were particularly concerned
about an executive who became entan-
gled with foreign governments, cor-
rupted our elections, or sought to avoid
consequences for his own misconduct
in office.
That is why they included impeach-
ment in the Constitution: to protect
our Republic.
Our colleagues across the aisle have
claimed that we are impeaching the
President because we don’t like him,
but this moment is about more than
disagreement with the President’s poli-
cies or personality. Those issues belong
in the voting booth.
Our task here is not to judge the
President himself. Instead, we must
judge his conduct and whether his ac-
tions have undermined our Constitu-
tion.
The President has committed the
highest of high crimes under our Con-
stitution. He used the highest office in
our government and taxpayer dollars
to pressure a foreign country to inter-
fere in our elections. He undermined
our national security.
When he got caught, he tried to cover
it up, obstructing our investigation
and refusing to produce subpoenaed
documents and witnesses.
A government where the President
abuses his power is not ‘‘of the people.’’
A government where the President
pressures a foreign country to under-
mine our elections is not ‘‘by the peo-
ple.’’
A government where the President
puts his own interests before the coun-
try is not ‘‘for the people.’’
This isn’t complicated. You know it.
I know it. The American people know
it.
President Trump’s wrongdoing and
the urgent threat that his actions
present to our next election and our de-
mocracy leaves us no principled alter-
native but to support these Articles of
Impeachment.
Our Constitution, our country, and
our children depend upon it.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I wish, as the gentlewoman just
said, that they would examine the fac-
tual conduct, but I guess that is not
going to happen.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHN-
SON).
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. COLLINS) for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, the Founders of this
country warned us against a single-
party impeachment because they
feared it would bitterly and perhaps ir-
reparably divide our Nation.
The truth is, in the 243 years of this
Republic, there has never been a single-
party, fraudulent impeachment process
like the one being used today.
Our Democrat colleagues have
weaponized the impeachment provision
of the Constitution to nullify the votes
of 63 million Americans who elected
President Donald J. Trump.
This is not about a phone call or
Ukraine or even his use of the execu-
tive privilege.
You have to remember that 95 of the
Democrats on this floor today voted to
impeach Donald Trump before the July
25 phone call ever happened between
President Trump and President
Zelensky.
Not only is this a single-party im-
peachment, it is also evidence-free.
After all their Herculean efforts,
they could only come up with two
short Articles of Impeachment.
On the first, the Democrats know
there is zero direct evidence in the
record of these proceedings to show
that President Trump engaged in any
abuse of power.
As you will hear today, their entire
case is based on hearsay, speculation,
and conjecture, and there is not a sin-
gle fact witness that can provide testi-
mony to support their baseless allega-
tions.
The Democrats’ second claim is that
President Trump obstructed Congress
by simply doing what virtually every
other President in the modern era has
also done, and that is to assert, Mr.
Speaker, a legitimate executive privi-
lege, which protects the separation of
powers.
And you know what? If they dis-
agreed with that, the Democrats could
and should have just simply gone a few
blocks away to a Federal court to get
an expedited court order compelling
the extra documents and information
they requested. That is what has al-
ways been done in the past, but they
didn’t do that here, because these
Democrats don’t have time for it.
They are trying to meet their own
arbitrary, completely reckless, and
Machiavellian timeline to take down a
President that they loathe.
The real abuse of power here is on
the part of the House Democrats as
they have feverishly produced and pur-
sued this impeachment 20 times faster
than the impeachment investigation of
Bill Clinton.
They are trying to reach their pre-
determined political outcome, and
along the way, they have steamrolled
over constitutionally-guaranteed due
process, previously sacrosanct House
rules, and the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure.
This must fail. This is a shameful
day for the country.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, the gen-
tleman knows that impeachment was
put into the Constitution as a defense
of the Republic in between elections.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.
JAYAPAL).
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, this is a
day of accountability and defending
our democracy.
The facts in front of us are clear: this
President, Donald J. Trump, coerced a
fragile foreign ally to investigate his
political opponent and interfere in our
elections. He leveraged critically need-
ed, congressionally-approved military
aid to Ukraine.
The President’s allies want to claim
that he did this because he cared about
corruption, but if President Trump
truly cared about corruption, then he
would have listened to the talking
points that were prepared by the Na-
tional Security Council on
anticorruption. He did not. In fact, on
those two calls with President
Zelensky, he never mentioned the word
‘‘corruption.’’
He did not abide by the Department
of Defense’s own recommendation that
Ukraine had passed all the
anticorruption benchmarks, and he
didn’t listen to the unanimous conclu-
sion of all of his top advisers that he
must release that aid to Ukraine.
He did release the aid in 2017 and
2018, but not in 2019. Why? Because in
2019, Vice President Joe Biden was run-
ning for President.
This is not hearsay. We have a re-
sponsibility. The President told us
himself on national television exactly
what he wanted from the phone call
with President Zelensky. He came onto
the White House lawn and he said:
I wanted President Zelensky to open an in-
vestigation into the Bidens.
He solicited foreign interference be-
fore, he is doing it now, and he will do
it again.
The President is the smoking gun.
Our Founders, Mr. Speaker, en-
trusted us with the awesome responsi-
bility of protecting our democracy,
which gets its power not from the
bloodlines of monarchs, but from the
votes of We the People.
Without that, we are no longer a de-
mocracy, we are a monarchy or a dicta-
torship.
So today, to uphold my oath to Con-
stitution and country, I will vote to
impeach Donald J. Trump.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I also remind my chairman that im-
peachment was never meant as a polit-
ical weapon in between elections when
you can’t win the next one.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY).
Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, other
than authorizing an act of war, im-
peachment is the gravest item that we
as a Congress can consider.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H12137
December 18, 2019
The decision to move forward with
impeachment of a United States Presi-
dent is so consequential that it has
only been done three times previously
in our Nation’s history, all based on le-
gitimate evidence of criminal behavior.
Unfortunately, many of my col-
leagues have diminished what should
be a solemn and grave proceeding into
an absolute political circus simply be-
cause they don’t like the man occu-
pying the White House.
Many Democrats have been intent on
impeaching the President since the day
he took office. Their actions are clear-
ly motivated by hatred for President
Trump. This impeachment vote today
is the next step in their long-held plan
to remove him from office.
The partisan impeachment investiga-
tion run by the House Intelligence
Committee was unnecessarily held be-
hind closed doors in a room designed to
share classified information.
Nothing classified was shared during
these meetings, but the result of this
decision was that most Members of
Congress and all Americans were
blocked from hearing the facts for
themselves.
Chairman SCHIFF repeatedly with-
held crucial information from the Re-
publicans, including the ability for
anyone but himself and his staff to
speak with the whistleblower at the
center of this investigation. He was
even called out by liberal media for
spreading misinformation and false-
hoods throughout the impeachment
process.
The public hearings were held with
complete disregard for the House rules
and decades of precedent. Republicans
were not allowed to call witnesses or to
make basic parliamentary motions. In
fact, the only witnesses allowed to tes-
tify publicly were those who fit neatly
within the Democrats’ predetermined
narrative.
Most importantly, we have not been
presented with any real evidence that
proves the President is guilty of high
crimes and misdemeanors, as required
by the Constitution to remove a duly-
elected President. If there was criminal
activity, as many of my Democrat col-
leagues claim, then why are there no
crimes listed in the Articles of Im-
peachment?
We have forever weakened this body
by turning impeachment into a polit-
ical weapon. This impeachment scheme
is nothing more than an attempt to
conduct taxpayer-funded opposition re-
search and damage the President’s
electability heading into 2020.
The American people see right
through this charade and are fed up.
It is time for this madness to stop
and for us to get back to the important
work the American people sent us here
to do.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TED LIEU).
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr.
Speaker, I thank Chairman NADLER for
his leadership.
Let’s start by making this very sim-
ple. No one in America could do what
Donald Trump did and get away with
it. No American elected official can
call up a foreign government and ask
for an investigation of a political oppo-
nent. No Member of Congress can call
up a foreign official and ask for help in
our reelection campaign. If we did that,
we would likely get indicted.
No one is above the law, and the Con-
stitution is the supreme law of the
land.
I first swore an oath to the Constitu-
tion when I joined the United States
Air Force on Active Duty. The oath I
took was not to a political party or to
a President or to a king; it was to a
document that has made America the
greatest nation on Earth, and that doc-
ument contains a safeguard for when
the President’s abuse of power is so ex-
treme that it warrants impeachment.
We are not here because of policy dis-
putes. While I disagree with the Presi-
dent, I acknowledge he has the right to
restrict the number of refugees enter-
ing our country, he has the right to
eliminate environmental executive or-
ders, and he has the right to sign a bill
that has given tax breaks to the
wealthy.
But the President does not have the
right to cheat and to solicit foreign in-
terference in our elections. That is ille-
gal, it is not what the voters elected
him to do, and we will not stand for it.
The President’s actions in this case
were particularly insidious, because he
also used our government for his pri-
vate gain.
He conditioned taxpayer-funded mili-
tary aid and a critical White House
meeting with the Ukrainian president
on the requirement that Ukraine pub-
licly announce an investigation into
his opponent. And by harming Ukrain-
ian national security, the President
also harmed U.S. national security.
b 1245
Then, the President solicited foreign
interference again on the south lawn of
the White House when he again asked
Ukraine to investigate his political op-
ponent. Then, he asked China, our peer
competitor, to do the same. That abuse
of power is not acceptable.
Whether or not the Senate convicts,
the House has an independent duty to
do the right thing. That is why we have
passed over 275 bipartisan bills that are
stuck in the Senate. Whether impeach-
ing or legislating, we will continue to
be faithful to the Constitution, regard-
less of what the Senate may or may
not do.
Moreover, impeachment is a form of
deterrence. Our children are watching.
No President ever wants to be im-
peached. Whether Donald Trump leaves
in 1 month, 1 year, or 5 years, this im-
peachment is permanent. It will follow
him around for the rest of his life. His-
tory books will record it, and the peo-
ple will know why we impeached.
It is all very simple. No one is above
the law, not our Commander in Chief,
not our President.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, it is my pleasure to yield 11⁄2 min-
utes to the gentleman from North
Carolina (Mr. MCHENRY).
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, in 2016,
63 million Americans went to the polls
and elected Donald Trump President of
the United States. House Democrats
have been trying to overturn the elec-
tion ever since. In fact, they have tried
five additional times to the one that is
before us to impeach the President, in-
cluding the vote in May 2017, just 5
months into his term.
In January of this year, House Demo-
crats took control of this Chamber, and
they were faced with a choice. They
could use the tools of the majority to
pursue legitimate priorities of the
American people, policies that can im-
pact their lives, or they could use the
tools to undo the 2016 election. They
made their choice.
Since then, House Democrats have
issued more subpoenas than bills have
been signed into law. That tells us all
we need to know about this Congress
and that party.
Rather than launch a legitimate in-
vestigation, Democrats turn to focus
groups to workshop their language, to
see if they could sell this to the Amer-
ican people, and the American people
have rejected it.
Instead of negotiating with the exec-
utive branch, for instance, and allow-
ing the courts to resolve any legiti-
mate disputes, House Democrats
rushed toward an impeachment vote.
So here we are, 12 weeks later, voting
whether to impeach the President
based off the thinnest record in modern
history. It is no surprise that the Sen-
ate is already asking for additional
witnesses, more documents, and real
evidence. The body of evidence is weak
and woefully insufficient for impeach-
ment.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. RASKIN).
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, American
elections belong to the American peo-
ple, not the American President and
not foreign powers.
No President may cheat the people
by working with foreign governments
to steal from us a free and fair elec-
tion. And no President who attempts it
may cover up that cheating by system-
atically obstructing Congress in our
work.
Article II of the Constitution does
not authorize a President to do what-
ever he wants. The reason we have a
Constitution is to keep government of-
ficials from doing whatever they want.
If we the people lose the certainty of
free and fair elections to Presidential
corruption and foreign manipulation,
then we lose our democracy itself, the
most precious inheritance we have re-
ceived from prior generations who
pledged their sacred honor and gave ev-
erything they had to defend it.
The struggle for democracy is the
meaning of America. That is why we
remain the last best hope of a world

We must act now to protect our elec-

mocracy for the enormous and unprece-
dented challenges that still lie ahead of
us.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, it is my pleasure to yield 11⁄2 min-
utes to the gentlewoman from West
Virginia (Mrs. MILLER).
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
opposition to H. Res. 755.
Today is a disappointing day. It is
the day my colleagues from across the
aisle cast the vote that they have spent
the last 3 years obsessing over, the
vote to impeach our duly-elected Presi-
dent.
There are two charges claimed by
House Democrats, and there is zero
cause for either.
While President Trump has led, our
country has thrived, and Washington
liberals have failed.
Despite the commitment of many of
our colleagues to obstruct the Trump
administration’s agenda at every turn,
our country continues to succeed.
In this body, however, we have not
been able to deliver on what Americans
want and need. We still have not fin-
ished securing our border. The opioid
epidemic still rages in our commu-
nities. Our infrastructure is still in
dire need of an overhaul. We still have
not reached a bipartisan resolution on
drug pricing.
If Congress hadn’t spent the last year
stuck in a divisive, ugly, partisan im-
peachment debacle, think of what we
could have done, the lives that could
have been saved, the communities that
could have been improved, the crisis on
our southern border ended, and the
positive work that we should do for our
country. But we didn’t, all because of
divisive political theatrics.
Congress can do better than this, and
America deserves better.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Rhode Island (Mr.
CICILLINE).
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
in support of the Articles of Impeach-
ment against Donald J. Trump, the
45th President of the United States.
Mr. Speaker, no one runs for Con-
gress to impeach a President. But this
President has left us no choice.
President Trump abused the enor-
mous powers of his office when he so-
licited foreign interference for the pur-
pose of helping him in his reelection
campaign in 2020.
The President betrayed our national
security and undermined the security
of our elections when he put his own
personal political interests ahead of
the interests of our country. He tried
to cheat to win reelection.
This wasn’t an attack on Vice Presi-
dent Biden. This was an attack on our
democracy.
If we do not hold the President ac-
countable today, we will no longer live
in a democracy. We will live in a dicta-
torship where any future President will
be free to abuse their office in order to
get reelected.
Today, every Member of this Cham-
ber faces a choice: whether to do what
the Constitution demands and the evi-
dence requires or to turn a blind eye to
the President’s grave misconduct, a
blind eye to the overwhelming evidence
of high crimes and misdemeanors.
To my friends on the other side of
the aisle, I say this: This is not about
making history. This is about holding
a lawless President accountable in the
way our Framers intended. This is a
time to put our country over your po-
litical party. Do not seek safety in the
high grass of a vote against these arti-
cles. We are all Americans. Show the
American people your devotion to your
country is more powerful than your
loyalty to your political party.
United, we can defend our democracy
from all enemies, foreign and domestic.
Divided, we risk losing our democracy.
All you have to do is look at the evi-
dence because it will leave you with
only one answer: The President of the
United States must be impeached.
Remember these facts: He tried to
cheat. He got caught. He confessed.
Then, he obstructed the investigation
into his misconduct.
For our democracy, for our Constitu-
tion, for the people you represent, and
for all who will inherit our country
from us, I pray you will do the right
thing.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, it gives me pleasure to yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. ROGERS).
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in complete and total
support of President Trump.
The matter before the House today is
based solely on a fundamental hatred
of our President. It is a sham, a witch
hunt, and it is tantamount to a coup
against the duly-elected President of
the United States.
This is a sad day for our Nation when
one political party, along with their
cohorts in the deep state and the main-
stream media, try to hijack our Con-
stitution.
The Democrat majority has irrespon-
sibly turned the impeachment process
into a political weapon, something that
Republicans refused to do when our
base was calling for the impeachment
of President Obama.
It is well past time for the House to
move beyond this hoax and put our Na-
tion first. That is exactly what Presi-
dent Trump is doing. The United
States has record-low unemployment
and historic performance in the stock
market. President Trump is rewriting
failed trade deals of the past to put
America first. He is rebuilding our
military, helped create Space Force,
and the list goes on.
I implore my colleagues to end this
spectacle now.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I am
hearing a lot from my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle, except a de-
fense of President Trump’s conduct,
which is indefensible.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
distinguished gentleman from Florida
(Mr. DEUTCH).
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, some say
this impeachment is about eight lines
in a call transcript, but there is so
much more. This was about a scheme
that lasted months and involved dozens
of Trump administration officials.
Look at the evidence, look at the di-
rect evidence: text messages, emails,
calls, and meetings.
Way back in May, the President told
his team: ‘‘Talk to Rudy’’ Giuliani.
The President’s message? No White
House meeting unless Ukraine helped
him in the 2020 election.
Ambassador Sondland said there was
a ‘‘prerequisite of investigations’’ into
the Bidens and announcement of inves-
tigations was a ‘‘deliverable.’’
Ambassador Volker said the most im-
portant thing for the Ukrainian Presi-
dent to do was commit to an investiga-
tion of the Bidens.
Just before the July 25 call, Volker
told the Ukrainians: ‘‘Assuming Presi-
dent Z convinces Trump he will inves-
tigate . . . we will nail down date for
visit to Washington.’’
The direct evidence kept coming
after the call, more texts, more emails,
and more calls, all with the same mes-
sage: If Ukraine didn’t announce an in-
vestigation into the President’s polit-
ical rival, then they wouldn’t get the
White House meeting that they had
been promised, and they wouldn’t get
the aid that they needed in their war
against Russia.
American Presidential power comes
from the people through elections. The
Constitution requires that we protect
those elections. But when the Presi-
dent abused his power to solicit foreign
interference, he was cheating American
voters before they even had a chance to
vote.
Mr. Speaker, President Trump’s ac-
tions force us to protect our elections
and the Constitution. I urge my col-
leagues to defend the Constitution,
support these Articles of Impeachment,
and remind the world that, in America,
no one is above the law.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I would remind this whole body that
it is more than eight lines. In fact,
there are four facts: There is no pres-
sure. There is no conditionality. They
did nothing to get it. And they got the
money.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to
the gentleman from Florida (Mr.
SPANO).
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
opposition to this political effort to re-
move President Trump from office.
I am not surprised this day has come,
but I am disappointed, disappointed be-
cause impeachment is one of the most
consequential decisions that we can
make in this body, and this impeach-
ment is based purely on partisan mo-
tives.
Speaker PELOSI said we shouldn’t go
down this path unless there was some-
thing compelling, overwhelming, and

bipartisan because of how divisive it
would be. Unfortunately, it is clear the
majority has had laser focus on one
thing for 3 years: impeaching the Presi-
dent.
The majority has failed to deliver for
the American people. They failed to
pass a budget on time, failed to pass
the spending bills on time, and failed
to deliver bipartisan solutions that will
actually help improve the lives of
Americans.
But the American people see through
this sad charade for what it is: an at-
tempt to undo the 2016 election based
on hearsay and opinion, not fact.
The transcript of the call showed no
conditions were placed on the aid.
President Trump and President
Zelensky have said there was no pres-
sure, and Ukraine received the aid
without taking any actions.
The Constitution is clear. The Presi-
dent may only be impeached for com-
mitting treason, bribery, or other high
crimes and misdemeanors. Nowhere in
the two Articles of Impeachment
brought today does it argue that the
President has committed treason, brib-
ery, or any crime under the law.
This is not overwhelming. It is not
compelling. It is not bipartisan. But
the Speaker was right in one way. This
is incredibly divisive and has lowered
the bar for what future Presidents will
face.
Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose the
articles before us today, and I hope
that we will finally move past this
nightmare and get to work to deliver
results for the American people.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, the evi-
dence is clear that President Trump
took advantage of Ukraine’s vulnera-
bility and abused the powers of his of-
fice to pressure Ukraine to help his re-
election campaign. This is the highest
of high crimes, and President Trump
must be held to account.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
distinguished gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CORREA).
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, as a member of the
Homeland Security Committee, I know
firsthand the dangers that foreign in-
terference in our elections present to
our democracy. As a Member of Con-
gress, it is my sworn duty to ensure
that our Nation is secure from all
threats, foreign and domestic. And
Congress has a constitutional job to in-
vestigate allegations of misconduct by
the executive branch, including the
United States President.
b 1300
The Constitution is the highest law
of the land, creating a system of
checks and balances to prevent the cre-
ation of a king. Congress is a coequal
branch of our Nation’s government,
equal with the Presidency, with duties
that are given to us by the Framers.
This is a very sad day, and I do not
take impeachment lightly; yet, I am
here to do my job as a Member of Con-
gress.
(English translation of the statement
made in Spanish is as follows:)
My town sent me to Washington to
work with everyone, Democrats and
Republicans, to improve the lives of
our communities.
Sadly, we are here, today, consid-
ering the actions of the President of
the United States.
My vote will be to ensure that we re-
main a democracy, and not a dictator-
ship.
Many of our sons and daughters have
paid the price of our freedom with their
blood. Our liberty and democracy must
be the inheritance that we leave to our
sons and daughters.
A democracy exists when nobody is
above the constitution, and we are all
subject to the law.
I ask God to give us wisdom, and to
help us unite our beloved homeland,
the United States of America.
Mi pueblo me mando a Washington
para trabajar con todos, Democratas y
Republicanos, para mejorar las vidas de
nuestra comunidad.
Tristemente estamos presentes,
considerando las acciones del president
de los Estados Unidos.
Mi voto, sera para asegurar que
sigamos siendo una democracia, y no
una dictadura.
Muchos de nuestros hijos y hijas, han
pagadado el precio de nuestra libertad
con su sangre. Nuertra liberated y
democracia, tienen que ser la herencia
que les dejamos a nuertros hijos y
hijas.
Una democracia existe cuando nadie
esta sobre la constitucion, y todos
somos sujetos a la ley.
Le pido a dios que nos de sabiduria, y
que nos ayude unir nuestra querida
patria, los Estados Unidos Americanos.
Mr. Speaker, today I pray to God for
His guidance in uniting our great Na-
tion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
BUTTERFIELD). The gentleman from
California will provide a translation of
his remarks to the Clerk.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I would have to disagree with my
chairman. I am not sure what he has
been watching, but the facts are not
undisputed. They are very much dis-
puted, not only by the minority, but by
the witnesses who actually testified.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CAR-
TER).
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to the Democrats’ sham process,
which makes a mockery of the rules of
the House and is, frankly, dangerous to
this country.
Since day one, the Democrats have
made it clear that they wanted to
move toward impeachment well before
any of the accusations took place.
What Democrats, unfortunately, don’t
recognize is the damage that this will
cause for our political institutions and
America’s trust for years to come.
Every American should be concerned
that Speaker PELOSI doesn’t trust our
citizens to let them decide who should
lead our great country.
This impeachment process isn’t fo-
cused on strengthening and protecting
our political foundations but, rather,
shaping public opinion.
I ask you: Is it worth that?
Not only is the process alarming, but
it is wasting taxpayer dollars and valu-
able time that elected officials could be
using to move our country forward.
That includes: securing our borders,
addressing student loan debt, and
bringing down the cost of healthcare
and prescription drugs.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues, while considering these arti-
cles, to ask themselves whether this is
truly being done for the good of the
country.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I would
remind the gentleman that, after re-
covering millions of dollars in ill-got-
ten gains, the Mueller investigation
was actually a net plus for the tax-
payers.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Colorado (Mr.
NEGUSE).
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I want to
thank Chairman NADLER and Speaker
PELOSI for their leadership and their
moral courage.
Today, the House of Representatives
is debating whether to take the rare
step of voting to impeach a President
for only the third time in our country’s
history. Unfortunately, President
Trump has left us no choice.
The fact of the matter is that the
President abused the power of his office
and invited a foreign country to inter-
fere in our elections. In so doing, he
undermined the sanctity of the free
and fair elections upon which our Re-
public rests.
Making matters worse, over the past
several months, President Trump and
his administration have done every-
thing they can to prevent Congress
from uncovering the truth.
Let us be clear, in the history of our
Republic, no President has ever ob-
structed Congress like this before.
During the Watergate investigation,
as my colleagues well know:
President Nixon’s chief of staff testi-
fied before Congress; President
Trump’s chief of staff refused.
President Nixon’s counsel testified;
President Trump’s counsel refused.
White House aides close to President
Nixon testified; President Trump re-
fused to allow any aide who may have
knowledge relevant to this investiga-
tion to testify.
Simply put, his administration has
engaged in a wholesale obstruction of
Congress, and that is exactly why we
are considering not just one but two
Articles of Impeachment before the
House today.
Every Member of this body has a re-
sponsibility to uphold our Constitu-
tion, to defend our Republic, and, when
necessary, to hold the executive branch
accountable. We are exercising that re-
sponsibility today.

Mr. Speaker, therefore, I will vote
‘‘yes’’ on both articles because it is
what the Constitution requires and
what my conscience demands.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I would never have thought that a
Department of Justice investigation
was used as a money revenue plot, but
I guess one thing is true: It was a loser
for the minority in a net profit situa-
tion.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to
the gentleman from Washington (Mr.
NEWHOUSE).
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, the
people’s House should be better than
this. We should be better than this.
During the Member’s remarks in the
Judiciary Committee, the committee’s
impeachment proceedings, he stated:
‘‘To my Republican colleagues: . . .
How do you want to be remembered
during this watershed moment in our
Nation’s history?’’
Mr. Speaker, it won’t be watching
sports on a laptop during official Judi-
ciary Committee proceedings to im-
peach a sitting President;
It won’t be using expletives to refer
to our President, calling for his im-
peachment just hours after being sworn
into Congress;
It won’t be using the chairmanship of
the once-respected Intelligence Com-
mittee to distort the President’s words
in order to mislead the American peo-
ple; and
It certainly won’t be using the most
serious and solemn powers of Congress
to overturn a legitimate national elec-
tion for political expediency.
No, Mr. Speaker, my fellow Repub-
lican colleagues and I won’t be remem-
bered in history for doing any of those
things because we know this is far too
grave a matter for subversions such as
these of our democratic Republic.
We should all be better than this.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire how much time remains on both
sides.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 1563⁄4 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from
Georgia has 157 minutes remaining.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR).
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, our
country faces a great tragedy and mo-
ment of truth. We have witnessed the
President of the United States abuse
his public office for personal political
gain and invite foreign governments to
interfere in our elections, putting the
integrity of a government of, for, and
by the people at great risk.
The evidence is overwhelming and
clearly shows that President Trump
will continue to abuse his office and
obstruct Congress if left unchecked.
The Intelligence Committee con-
ducted a robust investigation into the
President’s misconduct. Members
interviewed 12 witnesses in public hear-
ings, totaling over 30 hours; conducted
17 depositions, totaling over 100 hours;
examined text messages and emails; re-
viewed the President’s own words and
actions; and published a 300-page report
detailing their findings.
All of this, despite the fact that,
under the President’s direction, 12 cur-
rent and former administration offi-
cials refused to testify, even ignoring
subpoenas, and 71 document requests
were denied.
The Judiciary Committee then re-
viewed the evidence and concluded that
two Articles of Impeachment, which I
support, were warranted.
The evidence shows that President
Trump is a clear and present danger to
our free and fair elections and our na-
tional security. The most powerful evi-
dence of this pattern has come from
the President himself.
In 2016, we heard him when he called
on Russia to interfere in our elections.
He said: ‘‘Russia, if you’re listening.
. . .’’
He then repeated this call for elec-
tion interference on the July 25 call
with the Ukrainian President, and we
heard him again, on the White House
lawn, further adding China to that mix.
I stand ready to protect our sacred
Republic, support these Articles of Im-
peachment, and pray that my col-
leagues have the courage to do the
same. We must uphold our oath of of-
fice and defend the Constitution and
our fragile democracy, because no one
is above the law.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman
from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD).
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, in 2016, Vladimir Putin
and his cronies waged a war on our
elections with the goal of sowing dis-
cord and division in America.
Do you think he has been successful?
Somewhere in Russia right now, Putin
is laughing at us today. The majority
is giving him exactly what he wants: a
divided America with pure, partisan
politics, with nasty political rhetoric
at an all-time high. And some across
the aisle are discrediting the results of
future elections already.
It seems to many Americans that, for
the past 3 years, the House majority
has been carrying out the wishes of the
Kremlin. The sad part is the Democrats
have vowed to continue their sham in-
vestigations even after today’s vote.
Impeaching a duly-elected President
in a purely partisan manner with no
crimes to show for it—not one element
of a crime defined—disgraces the integ-
rity of our democracy.
Now is the time to end the partisan
politics, come together, and put Amer-
ica first.
Mr. Speaker, I urge this body to vote
‘‘no’’ to partisan impeachment.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES).
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, George
Washington, in his farewell address to
the Nation, counseled America that the
Constitution is sacredly obligatory
upon all. It is in that spirit that we
proceed today.
Donald Trump pressured a foreign
government to target an American cit-
izen for political gain and, at the same
time, withheld, without justification,
$391 million in military aid to a vulner-
able Ukraine as part of a scheme to so-
licit foreign interference in an Amer-
ican election.
That is unacceptable. That is uncon-
scionable. That is unconstitutional.
There are some who cynically argue
that the impeachment of this President
will further divide an already fractured
Union, but there is a difference be-
tween division and clarification.
Slavery once divided the Nation, but
emancipators rose up to clarify that all
men are created equally.
Suffrage once divided the Nation, but
women rose up to clarify that all
voices must be heard in our democracy.
Jim Crow once divided the Nation,
but civil rights champions rose up to
clarify that all are entitled to equal
protection under the law.
There is a difference between division
and clarification.
We will hold this President account-
able for his stunning abuse of power.
We will hold this President account-
able for undermining our national se-
curity. We will hold this President ac-
countable for corrupting our democ-
racy.
We will impeach Donald John Trump.
We will clarify that, in America, no
one is above the law.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman
from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK).
b 1315
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, nul-
lifying a national election requires an
overwhelming case of high crimes sup-
ported by indisputable evidence that
the vast majority of the Nation finds
compelling.
Now, article I is a made-up crime
called abuse of office. It does not
charge that the President broke any
law, but that Congress doesn’t like the
way he lawfully discharged his con-
stitutional duties. This would reduce
the Presidency to that of a minister
serving at the pleasure of Congress, de-
stroying the separation of powers at
the heart of our Constitution.
Article II is another made-up crime
called obstruction of Congress. It
means the President sought to defend
his constitutional rights and those of
his Office. This removes the judiciary
from our Constitution and places Con-
gress alone in the position of defining
the limits of its own powers relative to
the President.
Our Bill of Rights guarantees every
American the right to confront their
accuser, to call witnesses in their de-
fense, to be protected from hearsay,
and to defend these rights in court. The
Democrats have trampled them all in
their stampede to impeach. Even in
this kangaroo court, the Democrats’
hand-picked witnesses provided no
firsthand knowledge that the President
linked aid to action—in fact, two wit-
nesses provided firsthand knowledge

that he specifically ordered no quid pro
quo.
Any case that charged no actual
crime and offered no legally admissible
evidence would be laughed out of court
in a heartbeat. That is the case before
us today. It would redefine the grounds
for impeachment in such a way that
assures that it will become a constant
presence in our national life. Now we
know just how reckless is the Demo-
crats’ chant of ‘‘resist by any means
necessary.’’ This is a stunning abuse of
power and a shameless travesty of jus-
tice that will stain the reputations of
those responsible for generations to
come.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, abuse of
power was no vague or weak notion to
the Framers. It had a very specific
meaning: the use of official power to
obtain an improper personal benefit
while ignoring or injuring the national
interest. President Trump has abused
his office and must be removed.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
distinguished gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COHEN).
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, from our
founding, the United States has been a
special nation, a city upon a hill. Our
values are enshrined in our Constitu-
tion: liberty, equality, and oppor-
tunity. We are a self-governing people
where every person is equal before the
law. In the United States, we don’t
have a king. We choose our leaders. We
vote.
Generations of Americans have
fought, and some have died to secure
these inalienable rights. The Constitu-
tion begins: ‘‘We the People of the
United States.’’ That is us. It is not
‘‘we the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, or
China’’ or ‘‘we the Democrats’’ or ‘‘we
the Republicans.’’ It is: ‘‘We the People
of the United States.’’ All Americans—
and only Americans—get to have a say
in our elections.
Donald Trump used the high power of
the Presidency to pressure a foreign
nation to besmirch his perceived pri-
mary political opponent. He corrupted
our elections and compromised our na-
tional security so that he could keep
power—not power for the people, power
for himself. In 2016, Candidate Trump
called for foreign interference when he
said: ‘‘Russia, if you are listening.
. . .’’
In 2019, President Trump sought for-
eign interference when he needed a
favor from Ukraine to intervene in the
2020 election. President Trump at-
tacked and is a continuing threat to
our system of free and fair elections.
Like all of you, Mr. Speaker, I took
an oath to support and to defend the
Constitution. I urge my colleagues to
abide by that oath and stand up to
President Trump’s abuse of power and
obstruction of Congress. To my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle, I ap-
peal to your patriotism and implore
you to defend free and fair elections
and preserve the Constitution.
God save the United States of Amer-
ica.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman and all Members are reminded
to address their remarks to the Chair.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I do believe that our elections
should be free and fair. I do believe
that with all my heart. Except it seems
like in this case impeachment is based
on the fact that the Speaker said last
month it would be dangerous to leave
it to the voters to determine if Mr.
Trump stays in office.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.
HIGGINS).
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr.
Speaker, I have descended into the
belly of the beast. I have witnessed the
terror within, and I rise committed to
oppose the insidious forces which
threaten our Republic. America is
being severely injured by this betrayal,
by this unjust and weaponized im-
peachment brought upon us by the
same Socialists who threaten unborn
life in the womb, who threaten First
Amendment rights of conservatives,
who threaten Second Amendment pro-
tections of every American patriot, and
who have long ago determined that
they would organize and conspire to
overthrow President Trump.
We don’t face this horror because the
Democrats have all of a sudden become
constitutionalists. We are not being de-
voured from within because of some
surreal assertion of the Socialists’ new-
found love of the very flag that they
have trod upon.
We face this horror because of this
map. This is what the Democrats fear.
They fear the true will of we the peo-
ple. They are deep establishment D.C.
They fear what they call on this Re-
publican map, flyover country. They
call us deplorables. They fear our faith,
they fear our strength, they fear our
unity, they fear our vote, and they fear
our President.
We will never surrender our Nation
to career establishment D.C. politi-
cians and bureaucrats. Our Republic
shall survive this threat from within.
American patriots shall prevail.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON).
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I was not among those who sup-
ported impeachment before Ukraine,
but I have called for impeachment
today because our President is, as we
speak, abusing his power and placing
himself above the law.
President Trump’s attempt to sabo-
tage the 2020 election is a clear and
present danger on our democracy.
We the people know this, and more
Americans support impeachment today
than at any time since Richard Nixon’s
final weeks in office. We know that it
is wrong to enlist the help of foreigners
in interfering in our elections. We
know it is wrong to cheat, and we know
what is at stake. It is not just that our
elections were attacked; our elections
are under attack right now.
The very day the Judiciary Com-
mittee voted out Articles of Impeach-
ment, President Trump welcomed Rudy
Giuliani back to the White House.
President Trump is still at it. He is
doubling down. He doesn’t think he can
win an election fair and square, so he is
trying to cheat. To ignore these crimes
is not just giving the President a pass;
it is giving him a green light. Those
who vote against impeachment are not
just endorsing President Trump’s past
actions but his future ones as well.
If you think I exaggerate in warning
that our elections can be undermined, I
would urge my colleagues to come
down to Georgia and find a Black man
or woman of a certain age. They will
tell you that the danger is real. And
they will tell you of brave Americans—
patriots—willing to risk far more than
a political career who marched, strug-
gled, and sometimes died so that we
could have fair and free elections. We
are not asked to possess even a fraction
of their courage. We are simply called
upon today to do what is right. I am
proud to vote ‘‘yes’’ on impeachment.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I am glad that my colleague
just mentioned Georgia, because since
2014 the actual voter participation
among minorities—African American
female and African American male,
Hispanic male and Hispanic female—
has risen double-digits. I am very
proud of what Georgia is doing to get
everybody to the poll. I am glad he
chose to highlight it. Unfortunately, he
just highlighted it in the wrong way.
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes
to the gentleman from Pennsylvania
(Mr. MEUSER).
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, back
home people refer to Capitol Hill as a
bubble. They are right. It is as if we are
completely detached from what is
going on in communities across Amer-
ica. Many here don’t hear or listen to
what people are saying, and many here,
as well, think they know better than
the people we serve.
Our communities are benefiting
greatly from President Trump’s agen-
da: a booming economy, a secure bor-
der, better trade deals, and a stronger
military. Unfortunately, inside the
Halls of Congress, Democrats’ obses-
sion with impeachment is all con-
suming.
Is this how Democrat leadership
chooses to represent the people of
America, by nullifying the results of
the 2016 election, disregarding the will
of the American people, and doing ev-
erything in their power to prevent the
President and this Congress from doing
the job we were elected to do?
After 3 years of trying and months of
unfair, politically motivated impeach-
ment proceedings, Democrats have de-
livered two weak Articles of Impeach-
ment.
Abuse of power?
Not according to Ukraine. President
Zelensky confirmed many times that
there was no quid pro quo, no action
taken, and significant military aid was
delivered without anything in return.
Of course, his words have been conven-
iently dismissed.

H12142 December 18, 2019
Obstruction of Congress?
Is this the new standard?
If this is the new standard, then
every President since Jimmy Carter
and every President moving forward
would and will be impeached.
Let me be clear: It is an honor to
serve in the United States House of
Representatives, but today I am dis-
traught. Today Democrats will dis-
regard the will of the American people
and vote to impeach the duly elected
President of the United States. What
should be equally troubling is that this
has eroded, if not wiped out, the trust
the American people have in the 116th
Congress.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker,
President Trump said no quid pro quo
only after the White House learned of
the whistleblower complaints and after
the Washington Post had published an
article about the President’s pressure
campaign on Ukraine.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the distinguished gentlewoman from
California (Ms. BASS).
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, this is a
sad day in U.S. history when we have
to vote on Articles of Impeachment be-
cause Donald Trump has abused the
power of the Office of the Presidency in
his attempt to cheat his way to reelec-
tion.
The facts are uncontested.
Fact one: The President abused the
power of his office by attempting to
shake down the president of a country
that has been our ally. Trump wanted
President Zelensky of Ukraine to dig
up and to make up dirt on Vice Presi-
dent Biden because he sees him as the
biggest threat to his reelection.
Fact two: Trump wanted Zelensky to
go before the press and announce an in-
vestigation of Biden hoping the mere
announcement would create doubt
about Biden and strengthen Trump’s
hand in the 2020 election.
Fact three: Trump obstructed Con-
gress by engaging in a coverup. Trump
has refused to comply with congres-
sional subpoenas and has blocked cur-
rent and past employees from testi-
fying before congressional committees.
Congress is a coequal branch of gov-
ernment, and one of our central respon-
sibilities is to provide oversight and in-
vestigation of the administration—the
very checks and balances the Framers
built into the Constitution so no one
branch would have unchecked power.
The House of Representatives has no
choice but to vote and pass Articles of
Impeachment because President Trump
has abused his power and obstructed
the ability of Congress from per-
forming our constitutional duty. The
urgency to move forward with Articles
of Impeachment is because there is no
reason to believe President Trump
won’t continue to abuse the power of
his office, no reason to believe he won’t
continue to put his foot on the scale of
his reelection, and, in fact, his attor-
ney just returned from Ukraine, and in
an article just released in The New
Yorker magazine confesses to con-
tinuing the effort to interfere in the
election.
In many of our congressional dis-
tricts we worry about voter suppres-
sion and schemes that purge legitimate
voters from participating in the elec-
tion, or we worry about Russian inter-
ference in our election. It is a sad day
in America when we have to worry
about the Commander in Chief inter-
fering in the election in order to be re-
elected. Elections should be decided by
the American people.
I will vote for both Articles of Im-
peachment. It is my constitutional
duty to fulfill my oath of office. No one
is above the law.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Utah (Mr. STEWART).
Mr. STEWART. Madam Speaker, I
discovered something recently. It is
shocking, I know, but it turns out that
some people don’t like President
Trump. They think he is loud, they
think he can be arrogant, they think
sometimes he says bad words, and
sometimes he is rude to people; and
their sensitive natures have been of-
fended. I get that. I really do.
But let’s be clear. This vote this day
has nothing to do with Ukraine, it has
nothing to do with abuse of power, and
it has nothing to do with obstruction of
Congress.
This vote this day is about one thing
and one thing only: They hate this
President, and they hate those of us
who voted for him. They think we are
stupid, and they think we made a mis-
take. They think Hillary Clinton
should be the President, and they want
to fix that. That is what this vote is
about.
They want to take away my vote and
throw it in the trash. They want to
take away my President and
delegitimize him so that he cannot be
reelected. That is what this vote is
about.
For those who think this started
with this investigation, what nonsense.
You have been trying to impeach this
President since before he was sworn
into office.
b 1330
Some of you introduced Articles of
Impeachment before he was sworn into
office. This isn’t something you are ap-
proaching prayerfully and mournfully
and sadly: Oh, the chaos. Oh, the sad-
ness.
This is something you are gleeful
about, and you have been trying to do
it for 3 years. And it is very clear. You
don’t have to go back and Google very
much to find out that is the absolute
truth. I could give you pages of exam-
ples of things you have said for 3 years
about this President. That is what this
is about.
If this impeachment is successful, the
next President, I promise you, is going
to be impeached, and the next Presi-
dent after that.
If you set this bar as being impeach-
able, every President in our future will
be impeached. It erodes our Republic in
ways that our Founding Fathers recog-
nized. They got it right, high crimes
and misdemeanors. Other than that,
settle it at the ballot box.
I look forward to that day. Let the
American people decide.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
DEGETTE). Members are reminded to
address their remarks to the Chair.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
mind the gentleman that, if President
Trump is impeached and removed, the
new President will be MIKE PENCE, not
Hillary Clinton.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.
MUCARSEL-POWELL).
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Madam
Speaker, I did not have the privilege of
being born into this country. My moth-
er brought me from Ecuador, looking
for freedom and opportunity.
But that is not my story alone. This
is a story that I share with so many
people who live in Florida’s 26th Dis-
trict and all over the country. We have
experienced corruption in our countries
of birth, where brutal dictatorships
have choked their potential to benefit
those in power.
This President elected by the Amer-
ican people has violated his oath of of-
fice and violated the rule of law. The
evidence is overwhelming that he with-
held military aid approved by Congress
and leveraged a White House meeting
to extract a political favor from a for-
eign government.
The President actively sought for-
eign election interference to benefit
himself. It is undeniable that he has
abused his power and obstructed Con-
gress. He presents a clear and present
danger to our democracy.
As an immigrant, I still get chills be-
cause I feel so fortunate to live in this
extraordinary country. The genius of
American democracy lies in our Con-
stitution and the dedication to the rule
of law. I want my children, and all of
our children, to feel the same way
when they grow up.
However, if we sit idly by as cracks
begin to appear in our democratic in-
stitutions, our children will be in the
same situation so many of us experi-
enced when we left countries whose
leaders destroyed democracy.
We in Congress must abide by our
oath to defend our Constitution. That
is my duty as a Member of this body.
That is my duty as a mother.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. KING).
Mr. KING of New York. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for
yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in
strong opposition to the Articles of Im-
peachment against President Trump.
As Chairman NADLER must recall, ex-
actly 21 years ago today, I spoke on
this floor in opposition to the impeach-
ment of President Clinton. And 21
years ago tomorrow, I voted against all
four Articles of Impeachment against
President Clinton.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H12143
December 18, 2019
Today’s Articles of Impeachment
against President Trump are an assault
on our Constitution and the American
people. To impeach a President for a
phone call for which no crime is
charged, never mind a high crime, and
asserting his constitutional preroga-
tive as a President is a clear abuse of
power by the Congress. It sets a dan-
gerous precedent of weaponizing im-
peachment to undo the solemn decision
of the American people.
Madam Speaker, President Trump
and I grew up in the same borough of
New York City, and today, I am proud
to stand with President Trump and
urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on these horrible Ar-
ticles of Impeachment. I strongly urge
a ‘‘no’’ vote.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. LOFGREN).
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, the
President and Members of Congress
each take an oath to uphold the Con-
stitution. When the President abuses
his Presidential power to upend the
constitutional order, we have an obli-
gation to live up to our oath of office.
We have been presented with direct
evidence about the President’s actions.
They threaten our national security
and undermine the integrity of the
next election. We now vote on Articles
of Impeachment for abuse of power and
contempt of Congress as a result of
that evidence.
I have worked on Presidential im-
peachments as part of the Committee
on the Judiciary twice before. This
third time brings me no joy.
President Nixon attempted to cor-
rupt elections. His agents broke into
the Democratic Party headquarters to
get a leg up on the election, and then,
just like President Trump, he tried to
cover it up. Then, he resigned. This is
even worse.
President Trump not only abused his
power to help his reelection, he used a
foreign government to do it. He used
military aid provided to fight the Rus-
sians as leverage solely to benefit his
own political campaign.
George Washington would be aston-
ished since he warned ‘‘against the in-
sidious wiles of foreign influence.’’
The direct evidence is damning. The
President hasn’t offered any evidence
to the contrary. These actions con-
stitute grounds for Presidential im-
peachment.
What is before us is a serious abuse of
power and obstruction of Congress.
These abuses strike at the heart of our
Constitution.
The President’s unconstitutional
abuse of power, a high crime and mis-
demeanor, is ongoing. He totally re-
fused to provide any information to
Congress related to the impeachment
inquiry.
It is our responsibility to use the tool
our Founders gave us in the Constitu-
tion to preserve the constitutional
order. We must impeach.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr.
ROUZER).
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, The
Washington Post headlined the story
immediately following President
Trump taking the oath of office stat-
ing: ‘‘The campaign to impeach Presi-
dent Trump has begun.’’ How accurate
they were.
Here we are, almost 3 years later, and
what we are witnessing today is un-
precedented in American history, a
very partisan-based impeachment with
no facts that warrant it. This is an im-
peachment based on hearsay and specu-
lation rooted in a deep-seated hatred
for a man whom many of my colleagues
on the other side detest—not all, but
many. Nowhere in the Constitution
does it say that personal disdain is
grounds for impeachment.
At every turn, the claims made by
my Democratic colleagues have turned
out to be false.
Early on, it was claimed there was
evidence of Russian collusion. There
was none.
We were told the FBI didn’t abuse
the FISA process in its investigation of
the Trump campaign. That, too, has
now been proven completely false.
Then, when the Russian collusion
hoax collapsed, we were told that we
would hear from a whistleblower that
had details of a nefarious call between
the President and the President of
Ukraine. Then, we found out they
weren’t even on the call, and we still
don’t even know who the whistleblower
is.
We were told there was clear evi-
dence of a quid pro quo for personal
gain. After reading the transcript, it is
obvious that you have to make as-
sumptions that wouldn’t even stand up
in traffic court to come to that conclu-
sion.
Instead, the indisputable facts of
record destroy their case:
The call transcript shows no conditionality
between aid and an investigation.
President Zelensky said there was no pres-
sure.
The Ukrainian government had no knowl-
edge that any aid was being held up at the
time of the call.
Ukraine never opened an investigation, but
still received aid and a meeting with President
Trump.
Though they allege treason and brib-
ery by the President, the articles we
consider today only make vague accu-
sations of abuse of power and obstruc-
tion of Congress because they found no
evidence of treason or bribery, or any-
thing else, for that matter.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield an additional 30 sec-
onds to the gentleman from North
Carolina.
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, today
is a very sad day for our Republic. The
country is now more divided than it
ever has been in my lifetime. The truth
has been trampled by this House of
Representatives. Because of the abuses
of the FBI and the Department of Jus-
tice, more Americans have an even
dimmer view of very important Amer-
ican institutions. Thankfully, the lens
of history will ensure that the truth is
told and will endure.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, one
specific concern of the Framers was a
President who would corrupt our elec-
tions and who would abuse the great
powers of his office to ensure his own
reelection.
The impeachment inquiry is not an
effort to overturn an election. It is a
reaffirmation of the simple truth that,
in the United States of America, no
person—not even the President—is
above the law, and our democracy can-
not allow a duly-elected President to
abuse the power of his office for per-
sonal and political gain.
Madam Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes
to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.
JACKSON LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I hate no woman or man.
Today, the American people should
receive clarity and truth. The Con-
stitution is the highest law of the land.
The President breached and violated
the Constitution of the United States
of America. The President committed
constitutional crimes. The President’s
crimes are impeachable.
John F. Kennedy said: ‘‘If this coun-
try should ever reach the point where
any man or group of men by force or
threat of force could long defy the
commands of our court and our Con-
stitution, then no law would stand free
from doubt . . . and no citizen would be
safe from his neighbors.’’
The facts are undisputed.
First, President Trump violated his
oath of office by placing his personal
political interests above the national
interest by scheming to coerce Ukraine
into investigating a potential election
opponent.
Second, President Trump betrayed
the Nation’s interests by withholding
the congressionally agreed $391 million
to a fragile ally against a very strong
foe, Russia.
Third, the essential purpose of the
scheme concocted by the President was
to enlist a foreign country to help in
the 2020 election.
These acts are constitutional crimes
and abuse of power. The truth is, the
President did ask for a favor. Those
were his own words in the July 25 call—
no mention of corruption, only the
mention of the Bidens.
The President was engaged in wrong-
doing and is a clear and present danger.
He has a pattern, and his behavior re-
mains a continuing threat to America’s
national security.
The truth is that abuse of power does
violate the Constitution while both
corrupting and cheating our American
democracy. His acts betrayed the Na-
tion. He must take care to execute
laws faithfully.
This is the truth. Why does the truth
matter? Because it matters to the
farmer at his or her plow. It matters to

The Constitution must be preserved.
Our laws must be honored and re-
spected. The bloodshed and sacrifice of
fellow Americans cannot be ignored,
trampled on, or rejected.
Our actions on the vote taken today
must be for no personal gain or gran-
deur.
The bright light of this constitu-
tional democracy has been dimmed be-
cause of his acts. The truth is no
longer for all. It is for one man, Donald
J. Trump, his truth, his way.
We must reject that abuse of power
because that is not America. No one is
above the law. Alexander Hamilton
said impeachment was designed to deal
with ‘‘the misconduct of public men’’
and violations of public trust.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield an additional 30 seconds to the
gentlewoman from Texas.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. The President
has violated the trust. We must im-
peach Donald J. Trump.
Madam Speaker, I hate no woman or man.
Today the American people should receive
clarity and truth. The Constitution is the high-
est law of the land. The President breached
and violated the Constitution of the United
States of America. The President committed
Constitutional Crimes. The President’s crimes
are impeachable.
President John F. Kennedy said that, ‘‘If this
country should ever reach the point where any
man or group of men by force or threat of
force could long defy the commands of our
court and constitution, then no law would
stand free from doubt, and no citizen would be
safe from his neighbors.’’
The facts are undisputed. First, President
Trump violated his oath of office by placing his
personal and political interest above the na-
tional interest by scheming to coerce Ukraine
into investigating a potential election oppo-
nent.
Second, President Trump betrayed the na-
tional interest by withholding vital, congres-
sionally appropriated security assistance; $391
Million to a beleaguered and besieged ally fac-
ing armed aggression from Russia, America’s
implacable foe.
Third, the essential purpose of the scheme
concocted by President Trump was to enlist a
foreign country to help him fix the 2020 presi-
dential election in his favor, the very type of
interference most feared by the Framers.
These acts are Constitutional crimes and an
abuse of power.
The truth is this President did ask for a
favor—those were his own words.
The truth is 391 million dollars was withheld.
He jeopardized not only Americans’ national
security by putting Ukraine at the mercy of
Russia. He also threatened honest and fair
elections in 2020. In the July 25 call—no men-
tion of corruption/only the mention of the
Bidens.
The President was engaged in wrongdoing
and is a clear and present danger. His pattern
of behavior remains a continuing threat to
America’s national security. The truth is that
abuse of power does violate the Constitution,
while both corrupting act and cheating our
American democracy. His acts betrayed our
nation.
The Framers were concerned about abuse
of power as the Judiciary Committee impeach-
ment report said. The abuse of power was the
use of official power in a way that on its face
grossly exceeds the President’s constitutional
authority and violates the take care clause
which commands the President to faithfully
execute the law—not to demand a foreign
country to investigate his 2020 opponent and
deprives Americans a fair and unfettered right
to vote. This is the truth.
Why does the truth matter? Because it is
the American way. It matters to the farmer at
his or her plough.
It matters to the waitress on an early morn-
ing bus for the breakfast shift.
It matters to the steelworker helping to build
America.
It matters to the teacher in her fifth-grade
social studies class.
It matters to a Mother kissing her young
military recruit before he or she goes off to
war.
The Constitution must be preserved, our
laws must be honored and respected, the
bloodshed and sacrifice of our fellow Ameri-
cans cannot be ignored, trampled on or re-
jected and today our actions on the vote taken
today must be for no personal gain or gran-
deur.
The bright light of this constitutional Democ-
racy has been dimmed because of his acts—
the truth is no longer for all—it is for one
man—Donald J. Trump—his truth, his way—
we must reject that abuse of power—because
this is not America. No one is above the law.
As Alexander Hamilton wrote in The Fed-
eralist, impeachment was Designed to deal
with ‘the misconduct of public men’ which in-
volves ‘the abuse or violation of some public
trust.’ ’’ The President has violated that public
trust and the House of Representatives must
now protect and defend the Constitution and
impeach Donald J. Trump.
Madam Speaker, I include in the RECORD
several supporting documents.
The President: I would like you to do us a
favor though because our country has been
through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about
it. I would like you to find out what hap-
pened with this whole situation with
Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike . . . I guess
you have one of your wealthy people. . . The
server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a
lot of things that went on, the whole situa-
tion. I think you’re surrounding yourself
with some of the same people. I would like to
have the Attorney General call you or your
people and I would like you to get to the bot-
tom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole
nonsense ended with a very poor perform-
ance by a man named Robert Mueller, an in-
competent performance, but they say a lot of
it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can
do, it’s very important that you do it if
that’s possible.
President Zelenskyy: Yes it is very impor-
tant for me and everything that you just
mentioned earlier. For me as a President, it
is very important and we are open for any fu-
ture cooperation. We are ready to open a new
page on cooperation in relations between the
United States and Ukraine. For that pur-
pose, I just recalled our ambassador from
United States and he will be replaced by a
very competent and very experienced ambas-
sador who will work hard on making sure
that our two nations are getting closer. I
would also like and hope to see him having
your trust and your confidence and have per-
sonal relations with you so we can cooperate
even more so. I will personally tell you that
one of my assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani
just recently and we are hoping very much
that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to
Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to
Ukraine. I just wanted to assure you once
again that you have nobody but friends
around us. I will make sure that I surround
myself with the best and most experienced
people. I also wanted to tell you that we are
friends. We are great friends and you Mr.
President have friends in our country so we
can continue our strategic partnership I also
plan to surround myself with great people
and in addition to that investigation, I guar-
antee as the President of Ukraine that all
the investigations will be done openly and
candidly. That I can assure you.
The President: Good because I heard you
had a prosecutor who was very good and he
was shut down and that’s really unfair. A lot
of people are talking about that, the way
they shut your very good prosecutor down
and you had some very bad people involved.
Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He
was the mayor of New York City, a great
mayor, and I would like him to call you. I
will ask him to call you along with the At-
torney General. Rudy very much knows
what’s happening and he is a very capable
guy. If you could speak to him that would be
great. The former ambassador from the
United States, the woman, was bad news and
the people she was dealing with in the
Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let
you know that. The other thing, There’s a
lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden
stopped the prosecution and a lot of people
want to find out about that so whatever you
can do with the Attorney General would be
great. Biden went around bragging that he
stopped the prosecution so if you can look
into it. . . It sounds horrible to me.
President Zelenskyy: I wanted to tell you
about the prosecutor. First of all I under-
stand and I’m knowledgeable about the situ-
ation. Since we have won the absolute ma-
jority in our Parliament; the next prosecutor
general will be 100% my person, my can-
didate, who will be approved by the par-
liament and will start as a new prosecutor in
September. He or she will look into the situ-
ation, specifically to the company that you
mentioned in this issue. The issue of the in-
vestigation of the case is actually the issue
of making sure to restore the honesty so we

told me that she was a bad ambassador be-

his side. She would not accept me as a new
President well enough.
The President: Well, she’s going to go

Giuliani give you a call and I am also going
to have Attorney General Barr call and we
will get to the bottom of it. I’m sure you will

PUTIN RECLAIMS CRIMEA FOR RUSSIA AND
BITTERLY DENOUNCES THE WEST
(By Steven Lee Myers and Ellen Barry,—
Mar. 18, 2014)
MOSCOW.—President Vladimir V. Putin re-
claimed Crimea as a part of Russia on Tues-
day, reversing what he described as a his-
toric injustice inflicted by the Soviet Union
60 years ago and brushing aside international
condemnation that could leave Russia iso-
lated for years to come.
In an emotional address steeped in years of
resentment and bitterness at perceived
slights from the West, Mr. Putin made it
clear that Russia’s patience for post-Cold
War accommodation, much diminished of
late, had finally been exhausted. Speaking to
the country’s political elite in the Grand
Kremlin Palace, he said he did not seek to
divide Ukraine any further, but he vowed to
protect Russia’s interests there from what
he described as Western actions that had left
Russia feeling cornered.
‘‘Crimea has always been an integral part
of Russia in the hearts and minds of people,’’
Mr. Putin declared in his address, delivered
in the chandeliered St. George’s Hall before
hundreds of members of Parliament, gov-
ernors and others. His remarks, which lasted
47 minutes, were interrupted repeatedly by
thunderous applause, standing ovations and
at the end chants of ‘‘Russia, Russia.’’ Some
in the audience wiped tears from their eyes.
A theme coursing throughout his remarks
was the restoration of Russia after a period
of humiliation following the Soviet collapse,
which he has famously called ‘‘the greatest
geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th cen-
tury.’’
He denounced what he called the global
domination of one superpower and its allies
that emerged. ‘‘They cheated us again and
again, made decisions behind our back, pre-
senting us with completed facts,’’ he said.
‘‘That’s the way it was with the expansion of
NATO in the East, with the deployment of
military infrastructure at our borders. They
always told us the same thing: ‘Well, this
doesn’t involve you.’ ’’
The speed of Mr. Putin’s annexation of Cri-
mea, redrawing an international border that
has been recognized as part of an inde-
pendent Ukraine for 23 years, has been
breathtaking and so far apparently
unstoppable.
While his actions, which the United States,
Europe and Ukraine do not recognize, pro-
voked renewed denunciations and threats of
tougher sanctions and diplomatic isolation,
it remained unclear how far the West was
willing to go to punish Mr. Putin. The lead-
ers of what had been the Group of 8 nations
announced they would meet next week as the
Group of 7, excluding Russia from a club
Russia once desperately craved to join.
Certainly the sanctions imposed on Russia
ahead of Tuesday’s steps did nothing to dis-
suade Mr. Putin, as he rushed to make a
claim to Crimea that he argued conformed to
international law and precedent. In his re-
marks he made clear that Russia was pre-
pared to withstand worse punishment in the
name of restoring a lost part of the country’s
historic empire, effectively daring world
leaders to sever political or economic ties
and risk the consequences to their own
economies.
Mr. Putin, the country’s paramount leader
for more than 14 years, appeared to be gam-
bling that the outrage would eventually
pass, as it did after Russia’s war with Geor-
gia in 2008, because a newly assertive Russia
would be simply too important to ignore on
the world stage. As with any gamble, though,
the annexation of Crimea carries potentially
grave risks.
Only hours after Mr. Putin declared that
‘‘not a single shot’’ had been fired in the
military intervention in Crimea, a group of
soldiers opened fire as they stormed a
Ukrainian military mapping office near Sim-
feropol, killing a Ukrainian soldier and
wounding another, according to a Ukrainian
officer inside the base and a statement by
Ukraine’s Defense Ministry.
The base appeared to be under the control
of the attacking soldiers, who like most of
the Russians in Crimea wore no insignia, and
the ministry said that Ukrainian forces in
Crimea were now authorized to use force to
defend themselves.
The episode underscored the fact that the
fate of hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers, as
well military bases and ships, remains dan-
gerously unresolved.
In the capital, Kiev, Ukraine’s new prime
minister, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, declared
that the conflict had moved from ‘‘a polit-
ical to a military phase’’ and laid the blame
squarely on Russia.
Mr. Putin’s determined response to the
ouster of Ukraine’s president, Viktor F.
Yanukovych, last month has left American
and European leaders scrambling to find an
adequate response after initially clinging to
the hope that Mr. Putin was prepared to find
a political solution—or ‘‘off ramp’’—to an es-
calating crisis that began with the collapse
of Mr. Yanukovych’s government on the
night of Feb. 21.
Within a week, Russian special operations
troops had seized control of strategic loca-
tions across Crimea, while the regional au-
thorities moved to declare independence and
schedule a referendum on joining Russia that
was held on Sunday.
Even as others criticized the vote as a
fraud, Mr. Putin moved quickly on Monday
to recognize its result, which he called
‘‘more than convincing’’ with nearly 97 per-
cent of voters in favor of seceding from
Ukraine. By Tuesday he signed a treaty of
accession with the region’s new leaders to
make Crimea and the city of Sevastopol the
84th and 85th regions of the Russian Federa-
tion.
The treaty requires legislative approval,
but that is a mere formality given Mr.
Putin’s unchallenged political authority and
the wild popularity of his actions, which
have raised his approval ratings and un-
leashed a nationalistic fervor that has
drowned out the few voices of opposition or
even caution about the potential costs to
Russia.
Mr. Putin appeared Tuesday evening at a
rally and concert on Red Square to celebrate
an event charged with emotional and histor-
ical significance for many Russians. Among
the music played was a sentimental Soviet
song called ‘‘Sevastopol Waltz.’’
‘‘After a long, hard and exhaustive journey
at sea, Crimea and Sevastopol are returning
to their home harbor, to the native shores,
to the home port, to Russia!’’ Mr. Putin told
the crowd. When he finished speaking, he
joined a military chorus in singing the na-
tional anthem.
He recited a list of grievances—from the
Soviet Union’s transfer of Crimea to the
Ukrainian republic in 1954, to NATO’s expan-
sion to Russia’s borders, to its war in Kosovo
in 1999, when he was a little-known aide to
President Boris N. Yeltsin, to the conflict in
Libya that toppled Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi
in 2011 on what he called the false pretense of
a humanitarian intervention.
Since Russia’s stealthy takeover of Crimea
began, Mr. Putin has said very little in pub-
lic about his ultimate goals. His only exten-
sive remarks came in a news conference with
a pool of Kremlin journalists in which he ap-
peared uncomfortable, uncertain and angry
at times. In the grandeur of the Kremlin’s
walls on Tuesday, Mr. Putin sounded utterly
confident and defiant.
Reaching deep into Russian and Soviet his-
tory, he cast himself as the guardian of the
Russian people, even those beyond its post-
Soviet borders, restoring a part of an empire
that the collapse of the Soviet Union had left
abandoned to the cruel fates of what he de-
scribed as a procession of hapless democratic
leaders in Ukraine.
‘‘Millions of Russians went to bed in one
country and woke up abroad,’’ he said.
‘‘Overnight, they were minorities in the
former Soviet republics, and the Russian
people became one of the biggest—if not the
biggest—divided nations in the world.’’
He cited the 10th-century baptism of
Prince Vladimir, whose conversion to Ortho-
dox Christianity transformed the kingdom
then known as Rus into the foundation of
the empire that became Russia. He called
Kiev ‘‘the mother of Russian cities,’’ making
clear that he considered Ukraine, along with
Belarus, to be countries where Russia’s own
interests would remain at stake regardless of
the fallout from Crimea’s annexation.
He listed the cities and battlefields of Cri-
mea—from the 19th-century war with Brit-
ain, France and the Turks to the Nazi sieges
of World War II—as places ‘‘dear to our
hearts, symbolizing Russian military glory
and outstanding valor.’’
He said that the United States and Europe
had crossed ‘‘a red line’’ on Ukraine by
throwing support to the new government
that quickly emerged after Mr. Yanukovych
fled the capital following months of protests
and two violent days of clashes that left
scores dead.
Mr. Putin, as he has before, denounced the
uprising as a coup carried out by
‘‘Russophobes and neo-Nazis’’ and abetted by
foreigners, saying it justified Russia’s efforts
to protect Crimea’s population.
‘‘If you press a spring too hard,’’ he said,
‘‘it will recoil.’’
He justified the annexation using the same
arguments that the United States and Eu-
rope cited to justify the independence of
Kosovo from Serbia and even quoted from
the American submission to the United Na-
tions International Court when it reviewed
the matter in 2009.
Mr. Putin did not declare a new Cold War,
but he bluntly challenged the post-Soviet
order that had more or less held for nearly a
quarter-century, and made it clear that Rus-
sia was prepared to defend itself from any
further encroachment or interference in
areas it considers part of its core security,
including Russia itself.
He linked the uprisings in Ukraine and the
Arab world and ominously warned that there
were efforts to agitate inside Russia. He sug-
gested that dissenters at home would be con-
sidered traitors, a theme that has reverber-
ated through society with propagandistic
documentaries on state television and moves
to mute or close opposition news organiza-
tions and websites.
‘‘Some Western politicians already threat-
en us not only with sanctions, but also with
the potential for domestic problems,’’ he
said. ‘‘I would like to know what they are
implying—the actions of a certain fifth col-
umn, of various national traitors? Or should
we expect that they will worsen the social
and economic situation, and therefore pro-
voke people’s discontent?’’

JETLINER EXPLODES OVER UKRAINE; STRUCK
BY MISSILE, OFFICIALS SAY
(By Sabrina Tavernise, Eric Schmitt and
Rick Gladstone, July 17, 2014)
GRABOVO, UKRAINE.—A Malaysia Airlines
Boeing 777 with 298 people aboard exploded,
crashed and burned on a flowered wheat field
Thursday in a part of eastern Ukraine con-
trolled by pro-Russia separatists, blown out
of the sky at 33,000 feet by what Ukrainian
and American officials described as a Rus-
sian-made antiaircraft missile.
Ukraine accused the separatists of car-
rying out what it called a terrorist attack.
American intelligence and military officials
said the plane had been destroyed by a Rus-
sian SA-series missile, based on surveillance
satellite data that showed the final trajec-
tory and impact of the missile but not its
point of origin.
There were strong indications that those
responsible may have errantly downed what
they had thought was a military aircraft
only to discover, to their shock, that they
had struck a civilian airliner. Everyone
aboard was killed, their corpses littered
among wreckage that smoldered late into
the summer night.
Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin,
blamed Ukraine’s government for creating
what he called conditions for insurgency in
eastern Ukraine, where separatists have
bragged about shooting down at least three
Ukrainian military aircraft. But Mr. Putin
did not specifically deny that a Russian-
made weapon had felled the Malaysian jet-
liner.
Whatever the cause, the news of the
crashed plane, with a passenger manifest
that spanned at least nine countries, ele-
vated the insurgency into a new inter-
national crisis. The day before, the United
States had slapped new sanctions on Russia
for its support of the pro-Kremlin insur-
gency, which has brought East-West rela-
tions to their lowest point in many years.
Making the crash even more of a shock, it
was the second time within months that Ma-
laysia Airlines had suffered a mass-casualty
flight disaster with international intrigue—
and with the same model plane, a Boeing 777–
200ER.
The government of Malaysia’s prime min-
ister, Najib Razak, is still reeling from the
unexplained disappearance of Flight 370 over
the Indian Ocean in March. Mr. Najib said he
was stupefied at the news of Flight 17, which
had been bound for Kuala Lumpur, the Ma-
laysian capital, from Amsterdam with 283
passengers, including three infants, and 15
crew members. Aviation officials said the
plane had been traveling an approved and
heavily trafficked route over eastern
Ukraine, about 20 miles from the Russia bor-
der, when it vanished from radar screens
with no distress signal.
‘‘This is a tragic day in what has already
been a tragic year for Malaysia,’’ Mr. Najib
told reporters in a televised statement from
Kuala Lumpur. ‘‘If it transpires that the
plane was indeed shot down, we insist that
the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to
justice.’’
Mr. Najib said he had spoken with the lead-
ers of Ukraine and the Netherlands, who
promised their cooperation. He also said that
he had spoken with President Obama, and
that ‘‘he and I both agreed that the inves-
tigation must not be hindered in any way.’’
The remark seemed to point to concerns
about evidence tampering at the crash site,
which is in an area controlled by pro-Russia
insurgents.
Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin also spoke about
the disaster and the broader Ukraine crisis,
White House officials said, and Mr. Putin ex-
pressed his condolences. But in a statement
quoted by Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency,
Mr. Putin said, ‘‘This tragedy would not
have happened if there was peace in the
country, if military operations had not re-
sumed in the southeast of Ukraine.’’
The United Nations Security Council
scheduled a meeting on the Ukraine crisis
for Friday morning.
Adding to Ukrainian and Western sus-
picions that pro-Russia separatists were cul-
pable, Ukraine’s intelligence agency, the
State Security Service, known as the S.B.U.,
released audio from what it said were inter-
cepted phone calls between separatist rebels
and Russian military intelligence officers on
Thursday. In the audio, the separatists ap-
peared to acknowledge shooting down a ci-
vilian plane.
The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry sent re-
porters a link to the edited audio of the
calls, with English subtitles, posted on
YouTube by the S.B.U.
According to a translation of the Russian
audio by the English-language Kyiv Post,
the recording begins with a separatist com-
mander, identified as Igor Bezler, telling a
Russian military intelligence official, ‘‘We
have just shot down a plane.’’
In another call, a man who seems to be at
the scene of the crash says that a group of
Cossack militiamen shot down the plane. He
adds that it was a passenger jet and that the
debris contains no sign of military equip-
ment. Asked if there are any weapons, he
says: ‘‘Absolutely nothing. Civilian items,
medical equipment, towels, toilet paper.’’
Asked if there are any documents among
the debris, the man says, ‘‘Yes, of one Indo-
nesian student.’’
Myroslava Petsa, a Ukrainian journalist in
Kiev, said that the people in the audio
sounded shocked by what they had found in
the wreckage.
By Thursday night, American intelligence
analysts were increasingly focused on a the-
ory that rebels had used a Russian-made SA–
11 surface-to-air missile system to shoot
down the aircraft and operated on their own
fire-control radar, outside the checks and
balances of the national Ukrainian air-de-
fense network.
‘‘Everything we have, and it is not much,
says separatists,’’ a senior Pentagon official
said. ‘‘That said, there’s still a lot of conjec-
ture.’’
Russian troops, who have been deployed
along the border with eastern Ukraine, have
similar SA–11 systems, as well as larger
weapons known as SA–20s, Pentagon officials
said.
Petro O. Poroshenko, Ukraine’s president,
said he had called the Dutch prime minister,
Mark Rutte, to express his condolences and
to invite Dutch experts to assist in the in-
vestigation. ‘‘I would like to note that we
are calling this not an incident, not a catas-
trophe, but a terrorist act,’’ Mr. Poroshenko
said.
Reporters arriving at the scene near the
town of Grabovo described dozens of lifeless
bodies strewn about, many intact, in a field
dotted with purple flowers, and remnants of
the plane scattered across a road lined with
fire engines and emergency vehicles. ‘‘It fell
down in pieces,’’ one rescue worker said as
tents were set up to gather the dead. The
carcass of the plane was still smoldering, and
rescue workers moved through the dark field
with flashlights.
For months, eastern Ukraine has been the
scene of a violent pro-Russia separatist up-
rising. Rebels have claimed responsibility for
attacking a Ukrainian military jet as it
landed in the city of Luhansk on June 14,
and for felling an AN–26 transport plane on
Monday and an SU–25 fighter jet on Wednes-
day. But this would be the first commercial
airline disaster to result from the hostilities.
Despite the turmoil, the commercial air-
space over eastern Ukraine is heavily traf-
ficked and has remained open. Questions are
likely to be raised in the coming days about
why the traffic line, which is controlled by
Ukraine and Russia, was not closed earlier.
With the news of the crash on Thursday,
Ukraine declared the eastern part of the
country a no-fly zone. American and Euro-
pean carriers rerouted their flights, and
Aeroflot, Russia’s national carrier, an-
nounced that it had suspended all flights to
Ukraine for at least three days. The con-
spicuous exception was Aeroflot flights to
Crimea, the southern peninsula that Russia
annexed in March, a pivotal point in the
Ukraine crisis.
It was unclear late Thursday whether any
Americans had been aboard the flight. Rus-
sia’s Interfax news agency said there had
been no Russians aboard.
In Amsterdam, a Malaysia Airlines offi-
cial, Huib Gorter, said the plane had carried
154 Dutch passengers; 45 Malaysians, includ-
ing the crew; and 27 Australians, 12 Indo-
nesians, nine Britons, four Belgians, four
Germans, three Filipinos and one Canadian.
The rest of the passengers had not been iden-
tified.
Prof. David Cooper, director of the Kirby
Institute at the University of New South
Wales in Sydney, Australia, said that a
prominent AIDS researcher traveling to the
20th International AIDS conference in Mel-
bourne was among those on the flight.
Professor Cooper, who was heading to the
conference from Sydney, said he was un-
aware how many other passengers were also
on their way to the conference, which is
scheduled to start on Sunday.
Andrei Purgin, deputy prime minister of
the Donetsk People’s Republic, an insurgent
group in eastern Ukraine, denied in a tele-
phone interview that the rebels had anything
to do with the crash. He said that they had
shot down Ukrainian planes before but that
their antiaircraft weapons could reach only
to around 4,000 meters, far below the cruising
level of passenger jets.
‘‘We don’t have the technical ability to hit
a plane at that height,’’ Mr. Purgin said.
Mr. Purgin did not rule out the possibility
that Ukrainian forces themselves had shot
down the plane. ‘‘Remember the Black Sea
plane disaster,’’ he said, referring to the 2001
crash of a Siberia Airlines passenger jet,
bound for Novosibirsk from Tel Aviv, that
the Ukrainians shot down by accident during
a military training exercise.
In comments broadcast on Ukrainian tele-
vision, Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kiev,
said the crash illustrated the threat to peace
in Europe posed by the fighting in eastern
Ukraine. ‘‘This is not just a local conflict in
Donetsk and Luhansk, but a full-scale war in
the center of Europe,’’ he said. ‘‘I’m certain
the international community this time will
pay attention and understand.’’

IN UKRAINE, THE US TRAINS AN ARMY IN THE
WEST TO FIGHT IN THE EAST
(By Ben Watson, News Editor)
For more than two years, the U.S. mili-
tary’s contingent of 300 or so soldiers have
been quietly helping train an enormous al-
lied military in western Ukraine. Meanwhile,
Russian-backed separatists appear to be
keeping pace some 800 miles to the east,
showcasing entire parking lots full of new
tanks and artillery just a 15-minute drive
from the front lines.
‘‘Every 55 days we have a new battalion
come in and we train them,’’ said U.S. Army
National Guard Capt. Kayla Christopher,
spokesperson for the Joint Multinational
Training Group-Ukraine, at Yavoriv Combat

Training Center in western Ukraine. ‘‘And at
the end of that 55-day period, we’ll do a field
training exercise with that battalion.’’ The
U.S. and partnered armies have trained
seven battalions in the past roughly two
years or so.
That’s what she calls the ‘‘main line of ef-
fort that you tend to see most of the time in
the news.’’
Building a host-nation’s military, the U.S.
has learned painfully in the 21st century, has
rarely been a good news story. And Ukraine’s
conflict has largely taken a backseat to the
sequel to one of those stories: the war on
ISIS, in which eight Americans have lost
their lives fighting since 2014. In the same
period, Ukraine is believed to have lost near-
ly 4,000 soldiers to Russian-backed separat-
ists.
Since Crimea was annexed in 2014, the U.S.
and partner militaries have helped grow
Ukraine’s forces from just over 100,000 troops
to nearly 250,000 today. Just since January,
Capt. Christopher’s unit of 250 soldiers has
added another 3,000 or so Ukrainian soldiers
to Kiev’s ranks.
‘‘But that’s not the real end state,’’ she
said. ‘‘Essentially, what we’re trying to do is
get them to the point where they are run-
ning their own combat training center,’’ like
the U.S. Army’s National Training Center at
Fort Irwin, Calif., or the Joint Readiness
Training Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana.
In other words, their task is to build an
army’s entire training infrastructure almost
from the ground up—a tall order following
decades of not-so-casual corruption that has
plagued Ukraine’s and many post-Soviet
countries’ militaries across eastern Europe.
‘‘Our overall goal is essentially to help the
Ukrainian military become NATO-interoper-
able,’’ Christopher said. ‘‘So the more they
have an opportunity to work with different
countries—not just the U.S., but all their
Slavic neighbors, and all the other Western
European countries that come’’ and train or
exercise with Ukraine’s military.
That includes Poland, Estonia, Lithuania,
Canada, and the U.K. The U.S. has also sent
a variety of non-lethal military help to
Ukraine—equipment like Humvees, medical
supplies, bulletproof vests, and radars to
track the hundreds of artillery shells that
have fallen on the eastern Donetsk and
Luhansk regions. Maybe Javelin anti-tank
missiles, Defense Secretary Mattis said in
August. But Christopher’s unit is far from
the fighting. Their mission is ‘‘training the
trainers’’ and in particular, adding to
Ukraine’s NCO corps—the stern disciplinar-
ians who help ensure that units are fit and
ready for combat.
TERRORISM IN THE EAST
For Ukraine’s new soldiers, combat means
fighting terrorists—at least according to the
U.S. military’s way of looking at things.
‘‘They’re called anti-terrorism operations
rather than something else because of the
issue with the Russian-backed separatists,’’
said Capt. Christopher. ‘‘So they’re not real-
ly Russians, you know. They’re essentially
terrorists.’’
So the U.S. calls eastern Ukraine’s most
troubled regions an Anti Terrorism Oper-
ation zone, or ATO, where those Russian-
backed forces have attacked and counter-
attacked Ukraine’s soldiers and civilians.
(See, for example, this interactive day-by-
day map of alleged shelling by Ukrainian
government and separatist forces.)
In just the first two days of this month,
UN monitors recorded dozens of violations to
the Minsk II ceasefire, an agreement reached
in February 2015 between Russia, Ukraine,
France and Germany. The deal never really
stuck. It called for all heavy weapons—
tanks, rocket launchers and artillery—to be
pulled away from the front lines and kept in
monitored storage. By that time, more than
5,400 civilians had already been killed in the
fighting. In the months after Minsk II was
signed, the death toll barely slowed.
The UN calls these statistics ‘‘a conserv-
ative estimate based on available data,’’ and
inevitably incomplete ‘‘due to gaps in cov-
erage of certain geographic areas and time
periods.’’ Military casualties, especially in-
juries, have been particularly underreported,
the UN says.
Most of the civilians killed in the fighting
were killed by tanks and artillery, 55 per-
cent; followed by IEDs, 36 percent; and small
arms fire, 9 percent. For months it puzzled
observers how allegedly local separatists
could have obtained so much heavy weap-
onry, even factoring in Ukraine’s legacy as a
sort of junkyard of old Soviet weapons fac-
tories. The appearance of more advanced
equipment—drones and armored vehicles, for
example—revealed Russia’s hand in Ukraine
as early as January 2015, although President
Vladimir Putin didn’t admit Russia’s role
until that December. Since then, their ad-
vanced equipment has only grown more so-
phisticated and deadly for Ukraine’s front-
line soldiers.
International ceasefire monitors aren’t
having an easy go of their job in 2017, either.
During the first six months, they were re-
stricted from or intimidated through armed
confrontation (see photo below) inside re-
gions mandated by the Minsk agreement no
fewer than 480 times. More than 75 percent of
those occurred in separatist-held areas.
A WORLD AWAY
U.S. troops are largely kept away from the
conflict. That is by design; the U.S. and the
international community have struggled
with the appropriate response to Russia’s in-
vasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea.
Speaking alongside Ukrainian Prime Min-
ister Petro Poroshenko in August, U.S. De-
fense Secretary James Mattis said, ‘‘We do
not, and we will not, accept Russia’s seizure
of Crimea and despite Russia’s denials, we
know they are seeking to redraw inter-
national borders by force, undermining the
sovereign and free nations of Europe.’’
So far, sanctions have been the U.S. and its
European allies’ preferred response, hitting
Russia’s major banks and energy companies.
But President Trump has indicated that he
feels sanctions may not be in the best inter-
est of the U.S. In August, he complained
about a new round of sanctions passed by
Congress, calling it ‘‘seriously flawed.’’ But
the measure reached the Oval Office with a
veto-proof majority, and so he grudgingly
signed it into law.
But that is a world away from the U.S.
Army in Yavoriv, and even the fighting on
the other side of Ukraine feels remote, Chris-
topher said. ‘‘It’s actually pretty remarkable
how little you feel the effect of the conflict
on the western side of Ukraine. It’s almost
as if nothing is happening,’’ she said. ‘‘And if
I didn’t work directly with soldiers every
day, I don’t think you would really know. I
mean, we see it on the news every day, and
I work with soldiers every day. So we know
about it. But you go out into Lviv, or any of
the other big cities around this area and you
really don’t feel the effects of there being
war here.’’
Except, perhaps, for the U.S. and NATO
soldiers who for months have had their
phones and social media accounts breached
by what appear to have been Russian hack-
ers. On top of that, Moscow has spent the
past few months ferrying troops around its
border with Ukraine and into Belarus for ex-
tended exercises that run from the Barents
Sea to the Mediterranean.
So Russia is hardly backing down from a
tense region. And apparently, neither is the
U.S. Despite the Trump administration’s
hesitancy, its approach in Ukraine is not ter-
ribly different from the Obama administra-
tion’s.
‘‘The U.S. will continue to press Russia to
honor its Minsk commitments and our sanc-
tions will remain in place until Moscow re-
verses the actions that triggered them,’’ said
Mattis in August during the visit with
Ukraine’s Poroshenko.
For its part, Moscow’s latest move has
been not to reverse its annexation of Crimea,
but rather to fence off some 30 miles of land
on the seized peninsula. One Russian law-
maker even said in May that Moscow would
use nuclear weapons if the U.S. or NATO
tried to enter Crimea.
Which would suggest that the U.S. Army’s
quiet mission in Ukraine may go quietly on
for many, many months to come.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL).
Mr. MITCHELL. Madam Speaker,
today, the House of Representatives
votes on two Articles of Impeachment
for President Trump.
Members, and all Americans, must
recognize that impeachment was in-
tended to be a safety valve, rarely
used, only when a President acts in
such an immoral and blatantly unlaw-
ful manner as to threaten the very
basis of our Republic.
As we cast votes on these articles,
the future tone of this House and poli-
tics in this Nation must be carefully
considered. The issue is not whether we
agree with or like the President’s rhet-
oric, political tactics, use of Twitter,
policy choices, or his political rallies.
One of our Founders, Alexander Ham-
ilton, warned of the risks of impeach-
ment becoming a solely partisan act in
the Federalist Papers.
This impeachment inquiry and these
articles clearly do not heed that warn-
ing. These proceedings are weaponizing
impeachment, making it another elec-
tion tool.
I have carefully examined the evi-
dence presented throughout the in-
quiry and, contrary to some, consid-
ered our history, our founding docu-
ments, and our future. It is clear,
President Trump’s actions, as de-
scribed in these articles, do not con-
stitute treason, bribery, or high crimes
and misdemeanors. You simply don’t
like him.
I will be voting ‘‘no’’ on these arti-
cles and will hope, someday, we return
to serving the needs of the American
people.

Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Louisiana (Mr. RICHMOND).
Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker,
President Trump, on January 20, 2017,
raised his hand and swore to preserve,
protect, and defend the Constitution.
Now we must preserve, protect, and de-
fend the Constitution from him.
Madam Speaker, I rise today, not to
disparage and embarrass the President
of the United States, but to defend our
precious democracy.
I speak today, not because I hate this
President, but because I love this body,
the people’s House.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H12148 December 18, 2019
I have heard Republicans say: Why
are we rushing to judgment? This is
not a rush to judgment; it is a rush to
justice, and we must not delay.
Corruption is corrosive; it eats away
like acid. The longer we wait, the more
time we allow for this President to do
irreparable harm to our country and
our democracy.
Just last week, Rudy Giuliani was
back at it in Ukraine. So please don’t
tell us to wait, because the corruption
continues.
There is a famous quote that says:
Politicians worry about the next elec-
tion; statesmen worry about the next
generation. Today calls upon us to be
statesmen and stateswomen—Demo-
crat, Republican, and Independent. Our
election is under attack from within.
So, to my Republican colleagues,
many of whom spent a lifetime trying
to build a reputation of honesty and
courage, I beg you: Don’t throw that
away for President Trump. He doesn’t
deserve it, nor will he appreciate it
past the next tweet or next week.
My fear and my prediction is that his
actions will continue.
Madam Speaker, Donald Trump re-
cently said: I can do anything I want.
He also bragged that he could shoot
someone on Fifth Avenue and get away
with it. Well, he is shooting holes in
our Constitution on Pennsylvania Ave-
nue, and our House, the people’s House,
must defend the Constitution from a
domestic enemy to the rule of law:
Donald Trump.
Because I don’t want generations to
come to blame me for letting our de-
mocracy die, I, therefore, rise in favor
of impeaching Donald Trump.
Mr. COLLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKE-
MEYER).
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in strong opposition to
this political charade that has tor-
mented our country for nearly 3 years.
If there was ever any doubt that this
entire illegitimate investigation is 100
percent politically motivated, earlier
this month, Speaker PELOSI actually
admitted the impeachment process
began 21⁄2 years ago.
Let me say that again. The Speaker
of the House said publicly that the
Democrats have been trying to remove
our President from office since the day
he got elected, simply because it was
not the outcome they wanted.
Another of my Democrat colleagues
publicly admitted, in May, that the
driving force behind their actions was:
‘‘If we don’t impeach the President, he
will get reelected.’’
This wasn’t an investigation, Madam
Speaker; this was a political crusade.
In order to arrive at their Stalinistic,
predetermined conclusion, House
Democrats spent the last several
months staging well-rehearsed hear-
ings where the charges were drawn up
by their own focus groups; Democrat
donors served as witnesses; and Demo-
crat staff served as judge and jury.
Even with the odds so blatantly
stacked against the President, Demo-
crats still came up with absolutely
nothing.
A while ago, the Speaker spoke of the
Pledge of Allegiance. The last phrase of
the pledge is ‘‘justice for all.’’
Justice was not something afforded
the President during the investigation.
He was denied due process, something
the Supreme Court said should be af-
forded in all congressional investiga-
tions. That makes this process illegal
and illegitimate.
What a shame. What a sham.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. GARCIA).
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I didn’t come to Congress to im-
peach the President—even when he sep-
arated babies from their parents at the
border, even when he took money from
our troops to build his wall.
No, I didn’t call for impeachment be-
cause I am here to make a difference in
the lives of my constituents. Yet, here
we are in the middle of a constitutional
crisis.
As a former judge, I took my respon-
sibility seriously to weigh the evidence
and determine if the President’s ac-
tions were impeachable. Unfortunately,
the evidence in the Intelligence and
Judiciary reports leaves us with no
choice but to impeach the President.
So I stand on my oath that I have
sworn to the Constitution and to the
American people, and, today, I urge my
colleagues to stand by their oaths, too.
The Framers of the Constitution in-
cluded impeachment as a safeguard
against a corrupt President whose mis-
conduct could destroy the very founda-
tions of our country.
Donald J. Trump abused his power
when he obstructed Congress and or-
dered government officials not to ap-
pear before us.
Donald J. Trump corrupted our elec-
tion when he asked a foreign govern-
ment to interfere for his personal and
political gain.
Today, sadly, I ask my colleagues:
Will you put your party over our coun-
try, or will you help save our democ-
racy and vote ‘‘yes’’ on the Articles of
Impeachment before you? I urge you to
vote ‘‘yes.’’
Mr. COLLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I do have an inquiry as to the
time remaining for both sides.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 2 hours and
221⁄2 minutes remaining. The gentleman
from New York has 2 hours and 271⁄2
minutes remaining.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Iowa (Mr. KING).
Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
I start out, first, that this is the larg-
est, most massive coverup of such a list
of crimes against our country, and to
go so far as to bring impeachment
hearings to try to cover all of this up.
I would take you back to October of
2015, when Barack Obama said Hillary
Clinton would never intend to jeop-
ardize our national security. Again, the
following April, the next month, Peter
Strzok wrote the statement that was
delivered by James Comey: They have
spent Democrat money and Hillary
Clinton money in Russia to pick up
dirt on Donald Trump.
And then Joe Biden goes to Ukraine
and makes the statement: Here is a bil-
lion dollars, but you must do what I
told you to do.
You are accusing Donald Trump of
doing that which Joe Biden has con-
fessed to doing.
And, by the way, Joe Biden was not
the opponent of Donald Trump. He is in
a 21-way primary, and he is running
third in that race. His opponents are
the other 20 Democrats. How would
anybody dig into that mess of 21 people
and decide he is going to go overseas
and pull some maneuver like this?
You have to assign him a motive.
You assign him a motive, then you cre-
ate the dots, then you go dot to dot.
But the reality is that it was Biden
who was doing the extortion of the
power play in order to protect his own
son, and it was Donald Trump that was
following the law that said you have to
ensure that there is not corruption
here before this money is handed over.
By the way, there was a violent war
going on in Ukraine, and that is when
we sent blankets and MREs over there,
under Barack Obama.
But when I hear this from the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON): He
doesn’t think he can win the election
fair and square, so he would cheat—and
I have heard that here on this floor.
No, it is the other way around. Demo-
crats’ number one proponent of im-
peachment is AL GREEN of Texas, and
he said those very same things; and
they brought this case November 9, the
day after Trump was elected.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN).
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, words
matter. We have heard many words
over the course of these last weeks.
Still, what strikes me are the words
that are missing from my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle, a gaping
hole in this conversation, the words
they cannot or will not mouth, defend-
ing a President’s conduct, conduct that
threatens our constitutional order.
So, Madam Speaker, I ask: When is it
ever right for a President to coerce a
foreign power to interfere in our elec-
tions?
When is it ever right for a President
to intimidate a foreign leader into an-
nouncing false investigations into a po-
litical rival?
When is it ever right for that Presi-
dent to withhold congressionally ap-
propriated aid to that country at the
expense of its national security and our
very own?
And when is it ever right for a Presi-
dent to block a coequal branch of gov-
ernment from investigating this
scheme to cheat an election?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H12149
December 18, 2019
The answer, of course, is never. But
that word does not come trippingly
from the tongues of those who are
making the choice to stand behind a
man whose behavior is not worthy of
your tortured words.
By our vote today, we are speaking
to future Presidents and to future gen-
erations. We are declaring that we will
not tolerate foreign interference in our
Presidential elections. Americans
alone will determine the outcome.
And we will not permit a President
to order the complete defiance of a co-
equal branch of government.
In the end, regardless of the outcome
of this impeachment, the President’s
tenure will end, and this body and our
grandchildren will be left with what we
did here today.
Ours is a somber generational duty
about love of country and lifting our
Constitution to its gravest protections
but its highest aspirations.
Our democracy is a matter of con-
science and, by voting to safeguard our
Constitution, mine is clear.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
As I have reminded many times, we
have followed a sham process that we
have had to deal with, and we have fol-
lowed the facts and won both.
I will remind that, if you want to
talk about elections, remember, it was
the Speaker of the House who said we
can’t trust the voters; it is too dan-
gerous to leave it with the voters for
President Trump next year.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs.
LESKO).
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, as you
all know, I serve on both the Judiciary
Committee and Rules Committee, and I
have literally spent hours—hours—
poring over testimony, looking at doc-
uments, sitting in hearings.
And do you know the conclusion I got
from all of that? This impeachment is
a total joke and a total sham. And let
me tell you one of the reasons why I
think that.
All of those witnesses, the 17 wit-
nesses that the Democrats brought for-
ward, not one single one of them was
able to establish that President Trump
committed bribery, treason, high
crimes, or misdemeanors, which is re-
quired in the U.S. Constitution.
And, again, 17 out of 24 Democrat
Members on the Judiciary Committee
voted on this floor to move forward Ar-
ticles of Impeachment before the phone
call, and five out of nine Rules Com-
mittee Democrat Members did the
same thing.
So, if the main part of your impeach-
ment is the call, why did you vote for
impeachment prior to the call?
I also want to remind the American
public and others that, for 2 years,
ADAM SCHIFF claimed he had proof—
proof—that President Trump had
colluded with Russia. That turned out
to be false.
And then, overnight, it was obstruc-
tion of justice, then quid pro quo, then
bribery, then extortion, and the list
goes on; yet, not one of those is listed
in the Articles of Impeachment.
To my Democrat colleagues, Madam
Speaker, I say: Please stop tearing the
country apart. Stop this sham.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
The gentlewoman is correct. Presi-
dent Trump’s behavior is not new. He
has a pattern of engaging in mis-
conduct and then obstructing any in-
vestigation into his misconduct to
cover up his actions and hide the truth
from the American people.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. ROY-
BAL-ALLARD) for the purpose of a unan-
imous consent request.
(Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD asked and
was given permission to revise and ex-
tend her remarks.)
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam
Speaker, I rise in support of today’s
impeachment proceedings. I include
my statement in the RECORD.
Madam Speaker, today, the House of Rep-
resentatives will vote to impeach the President
of the United States. In America’s 243-year
history, he is only the third president to be im-
peached. The rarity of this process reminds us
impeachment is an extraordinary remedy and
should be taken only against a president if
their actions are simply beyond the pale.
When Congress learns a president may
have committed an impeachable act, it is
Congress’s constitutional duty to investigate
whether the president’s actions are impeach-
able. Our House did just that when we learned
the president may have undermined the Con-
stitution in his dealings with the Ukrainian gov-
ernment.
I disagree with President Trump on almost
every issue. I do not agree with the way he
runs his government. I do not agree with his
spending priorities. I do not agree with his
treatment of migrants seeking asylum in this
country. I believe he is temperamentally ill-
suited to his office, to put it mildly. But I have
had disagreements, of one kind or another,
with every president with whom I have served.
However, disagreements over policy, tone,
and style are simply not enough to justify im-
peaching a president.
The voters of our country placed incredible
trust in this president when they elected him.
He now holds the most powerful office in the
most powerful country in the world, the United
States of America. As president, he has a duty
to use that power to uphold the Constitution
and the rule of law. Sadly, this president has
violated that trust by soliciting and pressuring
a foreign nation to interfere in the 2020 U.S.
presidential election and by obstructing
Congress’s impeachment investigation. His ac-
tions undermine our Constitution, our system
of government, and the rule of law.
Today, the House is considering two sepa-
rate articles of impeachment. The first is that
the president abused his power and second,
that the obstructed Congress. Both of these
charges needed substantial evidence in order
to be proven, and the investigations of the
House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees
have given us that evidence.
Having reviewed that evidence, I will vote to
impeach the president. I take no partisan joy
in doing so. No American should take joy in
the impeachment of a president. But as Mem-
bers of Congress, we took an oath to support
and defend the Constitution of the United
States. Today we are living up to that respon-
sibility. My impeachment vote is also a signal
to future presidents that they are not above
the law and will be held accountable if they
violate our Constitution. When our children
and grandchildren look back on this historic
time, I hope they will know we did not shy
away from our oath of office and that we
fought to protect our democracy and to pre-
serve our Constitution for them and for future
generations.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.
LANGEVIN).
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, our
Nation was founded on certain prin-
ciples: that government should be of,
by, and for the people; that a system of
three coequal branches of government
would provide the checks and balances
necessary to ensure the people’s voices
are heard; and that no one is above the
law.
Today, sadly, we are voting to im-
peach President Donald John Trump
because he has fundamentally broken
his covenant with the American people.
In doing so, we are using the powers
the Founding Fathers enshrined in the
Constitution to address a President
who has violated his oath of office.
The evidence is clear and the facts
are not in question:
President Trump has consistently en-
gaged in a pattern of behavior incon-
sistent with the rule of law;
He has refused to take responsibility
for his actions;
He has undermined the checks and
balances we rely on by obstructing
Congress at every turn;
And, most importantly, he has
abused his power by using his office to
solicit foreign interference in our elec-
tions, undermining the will of the peo-
ple.
So, on this sad day for our Nation, I
will do what the President has so often
failed to do: I will fulfill my oath to
support and defend the Constitution,
and I will vote in favor of impeach-
ment.

Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT).
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, today
is a sad day in our Nation’s history as
House Democrats are poised to ap-
prove, on a strictly party-line vote, Ar-
ticles of Impeachment based on what
constitutional scholar Jonathan
Turley called wafer-thin evidence. This
will set a dangerous precedent where
impeachment becomes the norm rather
than the exception.
That is not what our Founding Fa-
thers intended. They wanted impeach-
ment to be rare. They set a high bar for
impeachment: treason, bribery, high
crimes and misdemeanors.
Alleged abuse of power, the first arti-
cle, is not a high crime and mis-
demeanor. In fact, that is not even a

crime. And since there is no concise
legal definition of abuse of power, the
majority party in the House can des-
ignate nearly any disagreement with
the President from now on an impeach-
able offense.
The second article, alleged obstruc-
tion of Congress, would produce a simi-
larly dangerous precedent. Asserting
executive privilege, a practice that
began with George Washington, is not
obstruction of Congress; rather, it is a
function of the essential checks and
balances contemplated under the Con-
stitution.
Here is what nearly every grade
school student in America knows but,
apparently, House Democrats do not: If
Congress disagrees with the President,
if they don’t agree with the President,
take it to court. Let the third branch
of government decide. They are the
refs.
The House has never—I repeat,
never—approved either abuse of power
or obstruction of Congress as an Arti-
cle of Impeachment, but that is going
to change today.
Today, House Democrats are pur-
suing a wacky constitutional theory
under which all four Presidents on
Mount Rushmore could have been im-
peached. If all of this sounds absurd,
Madam Speaker, it is because it is ab-
surd. In fact, this whole process is ab-
surd and has been from the outset.
But here is what is not absurd but,
rather, frightening: House Democrats,
today, are setting a dangerous prece-
dent under which no future President
will be immune from impeachment,
and that will forever negatively tar-
nish the history of this House.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, the
President’s conduct constituted the
highest of high crimes against our
country. An offense does not have to
violate a criminal statute to be im-
peachable. That was confirmed in
President Nixon’s case and again in
President Clinton’s. There is no higher
crime than for the President to use the
power of his office to corrupt our elec-
tions.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.
POCAN).
Mr. POCAN. Madam Speaker, this
July, President Trump blocked $400
million in congressionally approved aid
that Ukraine desperately needed to de-
fend itself against Russia because he
needed Ukraine to do him a favor first.
He asked the President of Ukraine to
launch a public investigation into a po-
litical rival. Military aid and other
benefits would only come after.
But this is not about a single call or
a single transcript; this is about a per-
fect storm, months of activity directly
ordered by the President to his senior
Cabinet and political appointees, an or-
chestrated plan demanding a foreign
power interfere in our democracy.
President Trump betrayed his oath of
office. He abused the power of his office
for personal and political gain and has
refused to cooperate with a coequal
branch of government.
This is a vote for our Constitution,
setting the precedent for all future
Presidents, Democrat or Republican.
Donald Trump must be held account-
able for his actions. Today, we send a
clear signal to this President and all
future Presidents: No one is above the
law.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL).
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in opposition to the im-
peachment of the legitimately elected
President of the United States.
Enough. Madam Speaker, for the love
of this country, enough. Enough of this
impeachment circus. Enough of these
sham witch hunts.
I am voting ‘‘no’’ because the Presi-
dent has done nothing wrong. The only
thing that President Trump is guilty of
is doing the things he said he would do;
and if my Democrat colleagues were
honest, they would tell us the only
thing President Trump is guilty of is
not being Hillary Clinton.
The only party guilty of obstruction,
abuse of power, or whatever focus
group terms they are using today is the
party on the other side of this aisle.
They are obstructing the will of the
American people. They are obstructing
the very foundations of our country.
By politically weaponizing impeach-
ment, they have dangerously shattered
precedent and abused our Constitution.
They, alone, will bear this responsi-
bility.
Madam Speaker, they will fail, and it
is no wonder the American people don’t
trust this body. It is past time to be
done with this circus and get to the
work that matters, like securing our
borders and passing trade deals.
I will vote ‘‘no’’ and encourage this
body to move on from this heart-
breaking, disgraceful day to things
that actually matter.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. PRICE).
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, the moment our Founders an-
ticipated in establishing the power of
impeachment has arrived.
The evidence is clear: President
Trump abused his power by asking a
vulnerable foreign leader to investigate
both his political rival and a baseless
Russian conspiracy theory, while with-
holding congressionally appropriated
defense aid and a coveted White House
visit. He then blocked congressional in-
vestigation into these abuses.
These abuses threaten the integrity
of our elections, they corrupt our di-
plomacy, and they undermine national
security.
We sometimes regard constitutional
checks and balances as the indestruct-
ible underpinnings of our democracy.
In fact, they’re not fixed. They’re not
indestructible. The President has dem-
onstrated this beyond all doubt.
It’s up to the Congress, the first
branch of government, to apply the
remedy that the Constitution pre-
scribes, because the threats to our de-
mocracy are real and present.
With this vote, we affirm that no
one, including the President, is above
the law.
Madam Speaker, impeachment was de-
signed by our framers as the ultimate constitu-
tional protection against presidential mis-
conduct, reserved, as North Carolina’s James
Iredell put it, for ‘‘acts of great injury to the
community.’’ The impeachable acts the fram-
ers envisioned were not disputed policy posi-
tions, as disastrous as they might be, nor
flaws in character, as deep as those might be,
but acts that threaten the very foundation of
the country and Constitution we vowed to pro-
tect.
In this moment, the future of our democracy
hangs in the balance.
The evidence is abundantly clear: President
Donald Trump abused his power by asking a
vulnerable foreign leader both to investigate
his political rival and to validate a baseless
conspiracy theory propagated by Russia, while
congressionally appropriated defense aid and
a coveted White House visit hung in the bal-
ance. He then blocked Congressional inves-
tigations into his abuses.
These abuses threaten the integrity of our
elections, corrupt our diplomacy, and under-
mine our national security. Underlying it all is
the President’s often-expressed conviction that
his powers are constitutionally unlimited.
We often regard constitutional ‘‘checks and
balances’’ as indestructible underpinnings of
our democracy. In fact, they are neither fixed
nor unbreakable. President Trump has dem-
onstrated this beyond all doubt.
When constitutional boundaries are broken,
it’s we—living, breathing people within our in-
stitutions who must rise to defend our democ-
racy. It is this accountability that prevents
creeping authoritarianism and protects our
representative democracy, where no one, in-
cluding the President, is above the law.
It’s up to the Congress, the first branch of
government, to apply the remedy that the
Constitution prescribes, because the threats to
our democracy are real and present. The eyes
of history are upon us.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER).
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, since
the beginning of this impeachment in-
quiry, it has been extremely troubling
to see the partisan, divisive way in
which Democrats have carried out this
entire process.
I guess we shouldn’t be surprised,
though. They promised they would un-
seat this President since the day he
took his oath of office. From the start,
this has been a baseless attempt to
undo the will of 63 million Americans
who voted for President Trump.
I can tell you the people I represent
in Kentucky, the very people who
voted for this President to enact
change and fight for this country, are
appalled at the charade they have seen
in the House in recent months. They
are appalled at the actions from House
Democrats who have failed to even
come close to proving their case.

of this sham process and these illegit-
imate Articles of Impeachment. These
articles were written and built on a re-
port that was drafted with biased pre-
sumptions, cherry-picked witnesses,
and vastly disputed facts.
The President did not commit any
impeachable offense, and it is clear for
all of us to see through the now very
well-known transcript. This rigged
process sets a concerning precedent for
impeachable offenses moving forward,
and I wholeheartedly oppose these
baseless Articles of Impeachment.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
California (Mr. PETERS).
Mr. PETERS. Madam Speaker, many
have lamented that this effort is not
bipartisan, but that is on my Repub-
lican colleagues.
Republicans have not sought the
truth. They have sought to avoid the
truth. They have demeaned and in-
sulted witnesses, patriots, warriors,
and career diplomats who have pro-
vided evidence against the President.
No House Republican has joined us to
demand the documents and witnesses
that President Trump has refused to
produce.
And Senate Republican leaders, this
week, have announced that President
Trump, himself, can set the rules of his
trial and there will be no fact wit-
nesses.
Republicans refuse to seek the truth
and condemn the abuse of power or to
work with us to prevent this ongoing
behavior in the future, and that is the
tragedy of today’s events.
In our Nation’s history, thousands of
Americans have gone into battle with-
out reservation to fight for our Repub-
lic as they still do today. Many have
been gravely injured, and some have
made the ultimate sacrifice. But today,
in contrast, for fear of losing an elec-
tion, my colleagues will not speak up
for the rule of law or against Presi-
dential abuse of power. Voters may
give them a pass, but history will judge
them harshly.
I will vote for the Articles of Im-
peachment.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr.
LOUDERMILK).
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker,
I thank my colleague and friend from
Georgia (Mr. COLLINS) for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in oppo-
sition not only to these Articles of Im-
peachment, but in strong opposition to
the process that has brought us to this
point.
Our Constitution and Bill of Rights
are all about process. Our Founders
knew that a government without con-
straints could accuse anyone of any
crime at any time, even without com-
pelling evidence. That is why the Fifth
and the Fourteenth Amendment have
established a bedrock principle of inno-
cent until proven guilty beyond a rea-
sonable doubt.
But on November 14, Speaker PELOSI
informed the press that the President
should prove his innocence when she
stated: Mr. President, if you have any-
thing that shows your innocence, then
you should make that known.
The Constitution also guarantees
that the accused can call witnesses to
testify on their behalf, but the Repub-
licans and the President were contin-
ually denied that right throughout this
process.
The Sixth Amendment guarantees
the right of the defendant to face their
accuser, but not only have the Demo-
crats prohibited Republicans and the
President from questioning the so-
called whistleblower, his identity has
been kept secret.
Before Members take this historic
vote today, one week before Christmas,
I want Members to keep this in mind:
When Jesus was falsely accused of trea-
son, Pontius Pilate gave Jesus the op-
portunity to face his accusers. During
that sham trial, Pontius Pilate af-
forded more rights to Jesus than the
Democrats have afforded this President
in this process.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, the
President was given the opportunity to
come and testify before the Judiciary
Committee, to send his counsel, to
question witnesses. He declined to do
so.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KIL-
DEE).
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, this is
a sad day for our country and for our
democracy. The President has abused
the powers of his office, betrayed the
public trust, and undermined Amer-
ica’s national security by pressuring a
foreign government to interfere in our
elections for his own political gain.
In this moment in our history, the
Constitution is clear: The remedy for
such misconduct by a President is im-
peachment.
I didn’t come here to Congress to im-
peach a President of the United States,
but, sadly, the President’s misconduct
leaves us no choice but to follow the
Constitution.
I have two grandchildren. My grand-
daughter, Caitlin, is 8, and my grand-
son, Colin, is 4. Some day a long time
from now, they will ask me about this
day. They will ask about the time a
President put himself above the law,
and they will want to know what I did
to stop him. And I will have an answer
for them.
Today, I vote to uphold the Constitu-
tion. I will vote to impeach Donald
Trump.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, it is interesting that the
President was supposedly given rights
in the Judiciary Committee, but maybe
who would he have asked questions of,
three law school professors and a staff
member? Not a lot of due process there.
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.
BABIN).
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, we are
here today because House Democrats
have spent upwards of $30 million in 3
years trying to overturn the 2016 elec-
tion of President Trump and come up
with nothing.
Because of their radical leftwing,
Democrats are willing to make all fu-
ture Presidential elections invalid
until judged worthy by the majority in
the House of Representatives.
The President of the United States
does not serve at the pleasure of the
House of Representatives.
Perhaps the greatest denial of reality
regarding President Trump is acknowl-
edging that, under his policies, things
are actually going much better than
they have in decades for working
Americans.
We are a democratic constitutional
Republic in which power flows from we
the people to our President and elected
officials.
The Democrat majority thinks other-
wise. They believe that they are enti-
tled to rule us even if they have to
change the rules to invalidate the will
and the votes of the people of America.
That is why the absence of a case does
not matter in this charade of impeach-
ment.
I believe that the American people
recognize and share my urgency about
what is at stake here.
Madam Speaker, you and your major-
ity may decide today, but I have faith
that the American people will decide
otherwise next November.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Washington (Ms. DELBENE).
b 1415
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in support of this resolution.
After carefully reviewing all of the
evidence and the Articles of Impeach-
ment before us, it is clear that Presi-
dent Trump abused the power of the
Presidency and obstructed Congress.
I did not come to this conclusion
lightly.
Impeachment is an extremely serious
matter, but no President can be al-
lowed to pressure a foreign country for
personal and political gain. No Presi-
dent is above the law.
His behavior has jeopardized the in-
tegrity of our elections, put our na-
tional security at risk, and placed his
personal interests above those of the
American people.
His obstruction has prevented the
House from conducting its constitu-
tional duty of oversight of the execu-
tive branch.
By failing to uphold his oath of of-
fice, President Trump forces each of us
as Members of the House of Represent-
atives to uphold ours.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to do just that, and defend our
democracy.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. RIGGLEMAN).
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Speaker, I
oppose this impeachment effort and
will vote ‘‘no’’ on the Articles of Im-
peachment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H12152 December 18, 2019
I represent the Fifth District of Vir-
ginia, which was home to so many
Founding Fathers whose vision shaped
the great country we are living in
today.
Thomas Jefferson and James Madi-
son are not around to see what their
creation has become, but I don’t think
they would be pleased to see Congress
subverting the will of democracy by
holding an impeachment vote because
the majority party simply cannot ac-
cept the 2016 election.
Instead of wasting the taxpayers’
time and money on specious investiga-
tions, we could have passed legislation
to address surprise medical billing, se-
cure the border, address the opioid epi-
demic, reduce student debt, and solve a
litany of other issues that Americans
actually care about.
Tomorrow, we might have a vote on
the USMCA, which we should have
passed months ago had it not been for
the obstruction and delays from Demo-
crats, delays that have made farmers
in my district and other districts suf-
fer.
Votes like the one we will take
today, the decisions that have led up to
today’s vote, the nature and entire
process of this proceeding reeks of ca-
reerist bureaucrats and politicians that
put politics over people.
I was not elected to take political
votes that attempt to overturn the will
of the American people. I ran for office
to serve my constituents. Let’s remem-
ber: that is why we are here.
Weaponizing emotion is not the way
to serve the United States of America.
And, Madam Speaker, to my col-
leagues who do just that, I offer a
quote Thomas Paine wrote in ‘‘The Cri-
sis’’: ‘‘To argue with a person who has
renounced the use of reason is like ad-
ministering medicine to the dead.’’
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
would remind the gentleman that the
House has passed over 400 bills, 275 bi-
partisan bills: driving down costs of
healthcare and prescription drugs, rais-
ing wages, rebuilding infrastructure,
taking on corruption and self-dealing
in Washington. Eighty percent of these
bills are languishing on Senator
MCCONNELL’s desk.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAP-
TUR).
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I
thank the chairman for yielding.
I wish to place on the record that
Members of Congress swear a solemn
oath to protect and defend the Con-
stitution against all enemies, foreign
and domestic. Today we fulfill our oath
by defending liberty.
The central figure testing America’s
resolve is not here in Washington
today. Rather, the closeted villain sits
in Moscow at the Kremlin.
Vladimir Putin has coordinated mur-
ders, election hacking, propaganda, the
entrapment of willing fools and greedy
underlings who put their own selfish
interests over liberty.
Putin seeks to sow disarray and de-
stabilize democracies and the NATO al-
liance. At Putin’s direction, Russia il-
legally invaded Ukraine in 2014. As
Ukrainians defend Europe’s eastern
flank, 14,000 people have been killed at
Putin’s hand, with over 2 million dis-
placed.
Rather than stand up to Putin, Presi-
dent Trump and his minions aided
Putin, first in hastening Russian inter-
ference in our 2016 elections, and then
more recently withholding vital mili-
tary aid from Ukraine to coerce its in-
terference in our 2020 elections for Mr.
Trump’s personal gain.
Might I end by saying: Onward to lib-
erty. Vote for the Articles of Impeach-
ment.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr. MUR-
PHY).
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina.
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to
these baseless Articles of Impeachment
and the unprecedented process that has
been used in this effort to impeach-
ment the duly elected President of the
United States.
It is a mockery of American justice.
In 1788, one of our Founding Fathers,
Alexander Hamilton, wrote in the Fed-
eralist Papers:
In many cases, impeachment will connect
itself with the preexisting factions . . . and
in such cases, there will always be the great-
est danger that the decision will be regulated
more by the comparable strength of parties,
majority and minority, than by real dem-
onstrations of innocence or guilt.
What does this mean? It means that
the majority can exert its influence re-
gardless of justice.
In this statement, Hamilton warned
us about the danger of mob rule.
Democrats have a criminal and have
been searching for a crime for 3 years,
but this President has not committed a
crime.
As the leader of American foreign
policy, the President has a constitu-
tional obligation to root out corrup-
tion in countries to which we provide
aid. This is not an abuse of power. It is
his job.
One of the articles is obstruction of
Congress. The only thing that has been
obstructed is this President’s right to
due process.
I don’t blame the President for refus-
ing to fully participate in this guilty-
until-proven circus. This is not how
our Founding Fathers framed Amer-
ican justice.
This is a tragic day in our Nation’s
history. We have individuals that hate
this President more than they love this
country.
Our country needs prayer, and not
this disruptive partisanship.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, the President’s ob-
struction is unprecedented and cat-
egorical. President Trump claims that
the House cannot investigate his mis-
conduct outside of an impeachment in-
quiry. He defies lawful congressional
subpoenas and then he sues to block
third parties from complying with such
subpoenas.
Even as he pursues his own interests
in court, his administration simulta-
neously argues that Congress is barred
from obtaining judicial enforcement
when executive branch officials dis-
regard its subpoenas.
So when can the President be held
accountable for his wrongdoing? In his
mind, never.
The Constitution, however, disagrees.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentlewoman from the District of
Columbia (Ms. NORTON).
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, my
words are my only remedy today, in
spite of the upcoming D.C. statehood
vote we expect to be successful.
The people of the District of Colum-
bia have no vote on impeachment or on
any other matter on this floor now.
I spoke on this floor on the impeach-
ment of President Clinton 20 years ago.
Unlike the Clinton impeachment on
perjury concerning an affair with an
intern, Trump’s impeachment turns on
sabotage of national security to get
himself reelected.
Clinton repented. Trump insists that
he did nothing wrong. That is a prom-
ise to continue his long pattern of
abuse of power and obstruction of Con-
gress.
Impeachment is our only recourse.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK), a
member of the Judiciary Committee.
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COL-
LINS) for yielding.
Today, Democrats lower the bar for
impeachment.
Under this standard, a President can
be impeached in the absence of a crime,
without due process, and for asserting
a legally, constitutionally recognized
privilege.
History shows Democrat Presidents
have abused power and undermined de-
mocracy to win elections, and yet they
have not been impeached.
President Franklin Roosevelt used
the IRS to target his political oppo-
nents. His son later admitted FDR used
‘‘the IRS as a weapon of political ret-
ribution.’’
President John F. Kennedy used the
FBI to wiretap and monitor political
opponents, including congressional
staff. He deported one of his mistresses
to avoid scandal.
President Lyndon Johnson spied on
Goldwater’s campaign, signing off on
wiretapping his opponent and Gold-
water’s airplane, and using a CIA spy
to obtain advance copies of Goldwater’s
strategies and speeches.
President Barack Obama refused to
provide documents to Congress related
to Fast and Furious. His unconstitu-
tional recess appointments were unani-
mously struck down by the Supreme
Court. He used national security agen-
cies to lie to the American people
about Benghazi to win the 2012 elec-
tion. He spied on reporters. Finally, it

was the Obama administration that
committed 17 serious violations before
the FISA Court to spy on Trump cam-
paign associates.
Despite these clear abuses of power
by FDR, JFK, LBJ, and Obama, Repub-
licans did not impeach.
Why? Because the Framers did not
want a low bar for impeachment. They
wanted Congress and the President to
work out their differences.
When I asked Professor Turley in a
Judiciary Committee hearing if any
President could avoid impeachment
with those low standards, he said,
‘‘No.’’
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
mind the gentleman that President
Obama provided thousands of pages of
information to congressional requests,
and that Attorney General Holder and
others testified, unlike now.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.
KELLY).
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, today is a solemn day in
America, a day that none of us hoped
for when we came to Congress, but the
events of today are something that
each of us swore that we were prepared
to execute in defense of the Constitu-
tion of the United States against all
enemies, foreign and domestic.
This is the oath that binds the men
and women of the 116th Congress, as
our democracy implores we defend her.
A clear and present threat to Amer-
ican democracy is what brings us here.
The architect, a President who asked
that a foreign nation interfere in our
election: this was our Founding Fa-
thers’ greatest fear.
I cast this solemn vote for the many
individuals in my district who en-
trusted me to be their voice in Con-
gress. They entrusted me to uphold our
Constitution for them.
I vote ‘‘yes’’ for Sarah in Chicago,
Doug in Kankakee, Diane in
Flossmoor; ‘‘yes’’ for Kathy in
Momence, Kathryn in Crete, and
Jimmy in Park Forest.
The facts are simple. The path for-
ward is clear. Impeachment is not an
option, it is an obligation, because no
one is above the law.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
RESCHENTHALER), another member of
the Judiciary Committee.
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam
Speaker, I thank Ranking Member
COLLINS for yielding.
You know, in the Navy, we had a say-
ing: BLUF, bottom line up front.
Well, I will give you the bottom line.
Democrats are terrified that President
Trump is going to win reelection.
They can’t beat him on the merits, so
Democrats are caving to their far left
radical base and they are using the
thoughts and feelings and the assump-
tions of some unnamed bureaucrats
rather than relying on facts and law to
impeach a duly elected President.
Let me be clear: This is nothing more
than a political hit job.
You know, I have been on all sides of
the courtroom. I was a prosecutor in
the Navy, I was a defense attorney in
the Navy, I was a district judge in my
hometown.
And let me tell you, as a lawyer, I
would defend this case every day of the
week. As a judge, I would dismiss this
on day one for lack of merit. There is
no prima facie case here.
I will tell you who I would prosecute,
though. I would prosecute ADAM SCHIFF
for abuse of power. Why? How about
the fact that he used his position as
chairman to leak phone records of
Ranking Member DEVIN NUNES? How
about the fact that he dumped over
8,000 pages of documents on Repub-
licans less than 48 hours before a hear-
ing? That is the abuse of power.
And obstruction? I would prosecute
the Democrats for obstruction. How
about the fact that the Judiciary Com-
mittee Democrats voted down my re-
quest to subpoena the whistleblower?
How about the fact that Chairman
NADLER refused every single Repub-
lican request for a fact witness? That is
obstruction of Congress.
So, again, let me be clear: Today is
nothing more than a political hit job.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, once
again, I hear a lot of attacks on Demo-
cratic Members of Congress, but not
one single word of substantive defense
of the President’s conduct.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY).
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker,
each of us here took an oath to protect
and defend the Constitution of the
United States, not the President, and
not our political party.
Today, history will judge. Did we
abide that oath?
To extort a foreign country to inves-
tigate your political opponent is an un-
constitutional abuse of power. To so-
licit foreign interference in an Amer-
ican election is an unconstitutional
abuse of power.
The need to protect against just such
abuses prompted our Founders to grant
the sole power of impeachment to this
House.
The delicate balance of power that
underpins our democracy is threatened
when a President disregards the Con-
stitution by obstructing Congress’
power in order to cover up illegal be-
havior. In doing that, President Trump
violated his oath.
b 1430
Today, we must put country over
party, conscience over complicity.
Today, we must assert no one is above
the law. Today, we are summoned by
history to do the right thing.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I know this is probably not
true, but I think the speakers are not
working on the majority side because I
have talked about it, and many of our
Members have talked about the facts.
Let’s just go over them real quickly:
no pressure, no conditionality, nothing
was ever denied them, and when they
got through, they actually got the
money, and they never did anything for
it.
We have talked about the facts. That
is a distraction that doesn’t need to
happen.
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes
to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DA-
VIDSON).
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam
Speaker, I have heard numerous col-
leagues say they didn’t run for Con-
gress to impeach the President. Well,
maybe not originally, but, unfortu-
nately, from the moment proceedings
began, after the fourth vote to launch
an impeachment inquiry, today’s vote
was inevitable. Many of them cam-
paigned on it.
I love this country with a soldier’s
passion. I came here to defend freedom,
not to deny due process to anyone. I
came here to solve problems and
change the broken status quo, not to
distract or disrupt those, like Presi-
dent Donald Trump, who deliver on
promises to put America back on the
path of peace and prosperity that has
made and kept our country free.
For months now, Americans have
heard speculation about the Presi-
dent’s motives in Ukraine. Despite
months of effort, dozens of hearings,
and countless documents, Americans
have not seen proof that the President
committed a high crime or a mis-
demeanor.
We have a republic, if we can keep it.
This is a disgraceful and dishonest
process. It is a discredit to this body
and to our Nation.
Madam Speaker, I urge the House to
drop these divisive Articles of Im-
peachment and get to work for the
American people.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, how
much time do both sides have remain-
ing, please?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 1 hour and
2 minutes remaining. The gentleman
from Georgia has 2 hours and 3 minutes
remaining.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from New York (Ms. VELÁZQUEZ).
Ms. VELÁZQUEZ. Madam Speaker,
the facts are clear. The President of
the United States withheld $400 million
in military aid to an ally of the United
States and also held back a White
House meeting to compel a foreign na-
tion to investigate his political oppo-
nent.
At the exact time the President was
doing this, Ukraine was engaged in a
battle for its very existence with one of
America’s adversaries, Russia.
The President abused his power to
persuade a foreign nation to dig up dirt
on a political opponent, and that is the
truth. This was, quite simply, a geo-
political shakedown.
The President then tried to block
Congress from exercising its constitu-
tionally mandated duty to uncover the
truth.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H12154 December 18, 2019
Every single one of us, today, faces a
stark choice. If we choose to turn a
blind eye, to put political expediency
before the Constitution, then we are
complicit in this subversion of democ-
racy. If we do not hold this President
accountable, we have failed the people
who sent us here, and we have abdi-
cated our own oath to defend the Con-
stitution.
In the United States of America, no
one is above the law, not even the
President.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. BYRNE).
Mr. BYRNE. Madam Speaker, in 3
months, we have gone from receiving
an unsubstantiated, hearsay, and dis-
credited whistleblower complaint to
the production of Articles of Impeach-
ment against a President of the United
States. Not since Andrew Johnson has
the House engaged in such a partisan
political stunt.
From the beginning, this has been a
sham, and this House has been nothing
but a star chamber. The Democratic
majority literally locked themselves in
the basement of this building, hiding
from the American people. When my
colleagues and I refused to stand for it,
Democrats moved to public hearings
but denied us questions, denied us wit-
nesses, and denied the President any
meaningful opportunity to defend him-
self.
With this complete abuse of process,
the Democratic majority has produced
the flimsiest and most legally unsound
Articles of Impeachment in the history
of this Nation. Never before has the
House reported an Article of Impeach-
ment that does not allege an under-
lying crime, yet this majority will do
so today.
Read the transcripts. There was no
quid pro quo, no bribery, no extortion,
no crime, and no abuse of power. They
don’t even allege a crime in their Arti-
cles of Impeachment. The President
raising Ukrainian corruption is not an
impeachable offense.
If the dealings of Hunter Biden were
so aboveboard, you would think the
majority would be just fine looking
into this matter. Yet, they haven’t
moved my resolution asking for an in-
vestigation, and our subpoenas for
Hunter Biden have all been denied.
Hunter Biden doesn’t get a pass be-
cause his dad was Vice President.
I am proud to have fought against
this charade every step of the way, and
I will proudly vote ‘‘no’’ today.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE).
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, the
facts are uncontestable. The evidence
is overwhelming. The President grossly
misused the Office of President and ob-
structed Congress, and justice requires
this impeachment.
I feel compelled to respond to the
false narrative that Democrats are
using this process to overturn an elec-
tion.
I agree that elections are the appro-
priate venue for public policy disputes.
However, we are not talking about a
public policy dispute. We are talking
about a President who subverted na-
tional security by soliciting foreign in-
terference in our elections, the exact
thing our Founding Fathers feared and
the exact circumstance for which they
drafted the impeachment clause.
Our democracy, our Constitution, de-
serves standing up for, not Donald
John Trump.
I will leave my colleagues with this
last thought as they decide how to cast
this historic vote: For what shall it
profit a man to gain the whole world
only to lose his own soul.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GOODEN).
Mr. GOODEN. Madam Speaker, this
is the day the Founding Fathers feared
when they granted Congress the power
of impeachment, where we have a polit-
ical party so dead set against the
President that they will do anything to
impeach him. And they are about to
get away with it, simply because they
have the votes. But that is not how
this process is supposed to work.
It is not meant to be dictated by a
thin partisan majority, nor is it meant
to be used when an election is just
around the corner.
No one understands that better than
our Speaker, for whom I have great re-
spect. And I agree with the comments
she made on March 6 of just this year:
‘‘Impeachment is so divisive to the
country that unless there is something
so compelling and overwhelming and
bipartisan, I don’t think we should go
down that path because it divides’’ the
Nation.
That is exactly what has happened.
When we walk out of here tonight, we
all know how this result is going to go.
The Democrats are voting for this. Not
one Republican is breaking. This is not
bipartisan.
The American people are disgusted
with the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, and we bring shame upon
this body today by moving forward
with this impeachment.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
California (Mr. LOWENTHAL).
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Madam Speaker,
the facts in this case are as simple as
they are tragic. Witness after witness
attested to these facts. No one has
credibly refuted them.
President Trump tried to coerce
Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 elec-
tions. He used the power of his office
for personal political gain.
By withholding aid to Ukraine, the
President has endangered our ally
Ukraine and undermined our own na-
tional security. When he got caught,
the President attempted to cover up
the crime and shut down any investiga-
tion by obstructing Congress.
We have overwhelming evidence that
this President poses an urgent threat
to our elections, to our national secu-
rity, and to the rule of law. Congress
must vote to impeach him to protect
our constitutional Republic. There is
no alternative.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, the only urgent threat to this
body is the clock and the calendar and
the desire to impeach the President be-
fore we go home for Christmas.
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes
to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.
DAVID P. ROE).
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, today is a sad day in
the people’s House. Since Donald
Trump was elected in 2016, Democrats
have been on a crusade to stop him by
any means.
I believe the American people are the
fairest people on this Earth. They be-
lieve that everyone should be treated
equally under the law, no matter what
station you occupy in life: rich or poor,
President or factory worker—fair. This
process has been anything but fair.
For 2 years, we have been told that
then-candidate Donald Trump colluded
with Russians to interfere with our
elections. Two years and millions of
dollars spent on the Mueller investiga-
tion: no collusion.
You would think, after being that
wrong, Democrats would finally decide
to work on the problems that the
American people sent us here to do.
You would be wrong again.
Then, we were told that the Presi-
dent withheld money to the Ukrainians
in a quid pro quo. No, no, a bribery. No,
abuse of power. I guess whatever polls
best—to gather information on a po-
tential political rival.
Well, here are some facts about what
happened:
Fact number one: The transcript of
the July 25 phone conversation that
the President released shows no pres-
sure.
Fact number two: President Zelensky
did not know the money was withheld.
Fact number three: No investigation
occurred or was announced.
Fact number four: The money was re-
leased September 11, 2019.
Facts are stubborn things. One Mem-
ber on the other side of the aisle said:
‘‘I’m concerned that if we don’t im-
peach this President, he will get re-
elected.’’ That, Madam Speaker, says it
all.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI).
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I
take seriously my oath to uphold and
defend the Constitution, and I do not
take today’s proceedings lightly.
The Founding Fathers included the
impeachment process in the Constitu-
tion to uphold our values and to main-
tain the checks and balances that are
essential to separation of powers and
to democracy. They knew way back in
1787 that a President could abuse the
power of the office. In fact, they adopt-
ed the phrase ‘‘high crimes and mis-
demeanors’’ from a phrase that had
been used in the English Parliament

since 1386 intended to cover situations
where an official abused his power and
included disobeying an order from the
Parliament.
Donald Trump has abused the power
of his office by inviting a foreign gov-
ernment to interfere in the U.S. elec-
tion. He did this not to help the United
States but to benefit himself. That is
wrong, and it is an impeachable of-
fense.
Then, when Congress exercised our
constitutional duty to investigate
these wrongdoings, he obstructed the
investigation every step of the way.
That is also wrong, and it is also an
impeachable offense.
In our country, no one is above the
law. That includes the President of the
United States.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
KELLY).
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam
Speaker, December is such a great
month, and there are so many great
dates in December. We talk about the
wonderful things that have happened in
Decembers of the past.
In addition to Christmas being some-
thing we celebrate, the Boston Tea
Party took place in December. Also, on
December 7, 1941, a horrific act hap-
pened in the United States, one that
President Roosevelt said: This is a date
that ‘‘will live in infamy.’’
Today, December 18, 2019, is another
date that will live in infamy. Just be-
cause you hate the President of the
United States, and you can find no
other reason other than the fact that
you are so blinded by your hate that
you can’t see straight, you have de-
cided the only way we can make sure
this President doesn’t get elected again
is to impeach him.
On the floor of the people’s House,
the bastion of democracy and liberty in
the whole world, we have decided that
political power is far more important
than principle.
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members
of the House to vote ‘‘no’’ on impeach-
ment and to look their voters in the
eye.
Listen, let me tell you, the voters
will remember next November what
you are doing this December. This is a
terrible time. This is a date that will
live in infamy.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Florida (Ms. FRANKEL).
Ms. FRANKEL. Madam Speaker, in
1787, at the conclusion of the Constitu-
tional Convention, Benjamin Franklin
was asked: Do we have a republic or a
monarchy?
He responded: ‘‘A republic, if you can
keep it.’’
Madam Speaker, a republic is a form
of government in which the country is
considered a public matter, not the pri-
vate concern or property of the rulers.
b 1445
In a republic, no person is above the
law. In a republic, the President may
not abuse his power by withholding
critical foreign assistance for his own
personal political gain nor may he stop
witnesses from talking.
I did not come to Congress to im-
peach a President, but I did take an
oath to keep the Republic. For our
children and our grandchildren, we
should do nothing less. One day, I will
tell my grandson that I stood up for
our democracy.
I will vote ‘‘yes’’ to impeach the
President.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 1–2/3 minutes to the
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.
GROTHMAN).
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I would like to ad-
dress why we are here.
We are certainly not here because of
a misquoted phone call in July of 2019.
The Washington Post ran an article,
headlined, ‘‘The Campaign to Impeach
President Trump Has Begun,’’ the day
he was sworn in.
The gentleman from Maryland who
spoke earlier today called for impeach-
ment 2 days before President Trump
was sworn in.
The gentleman from Texas was intro-
ducing impeachment resolutions 2
years ago and said: President Trump
should be impeached so he can’t get re-
elected.
This impeachment is not about any-
thing that happened on a phone call.
This impeachment is about what Presi-
dent Trump has done.
The people in this country who are
let in who are inadmissible or appre-
hended and don’t have legal authority
fell from 100,000 people in May to under
5,000 people in November, and you hate
him for it.
Ben Carson thinks that low-income
housing should be used by American
citizens and not people who are here il-
legally, and you hate him for it.
President Trump doesn’t want people
coming here and going on welfare, and
you hate him for it.
President Trump wants able-bodied
people on food stamps to try to work,
and he is hated for it.
President Trump renegotiated that
rip-off trade agreement with Mexico
and Canada and that was put in place
by President Bush and President
Obama, and you hate him for it.
President Trump sides with law en-
forcement instead of criminals and
murders dropped 1,000 people last year,
and you hate him for siding with the
police.
President Trump lets Christian adop-
tion agencies choose whom they want
to be parents, and you don’t like him
for that.
President Trump won’t let foreign
aid go to agencies that perform abor-
tions, and you hate him for that.
President Trump’s judges stick to
the Constitution, and he is disliked for
that.
President Trump is keeping his cam-
paign promises, and you hate him for
that.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are again reminded to address
their remarks to the Chair.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
We do not hate President Trump, but
we do know that President Trump will
continue to threaten the Nation’s secu-
rity, democracy, and constitutional
system if he is allowed to remain in of-
fice. That threat is not hypothetical.
President Trump has persisted, dur-
ing this impeachment inquiry, in solic-
iting foreign powers to investigate his
political opponent.
The President steadfastly insists
that he did nothing wrong and is free
to do it all again. That threatens our
next election as well as our constitu-
tional democracy.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentleman from California (Mr.
MCNERNEY).
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker,
the House of Representatives, the peo-
ple’s House, is vested by the Constitu-
tion with the power of impeachment to
balance the power of the Presidency.
Without this essential duty, the Presi-
dent could exploit his sacred office
without any regard for the law.
On January 3, 2019, every Member of
the House swore an oath to defend the
Constitution, and this week, we are
being asked to do just that.
When allegations arose that the
President tried to coerce a foreign gov-
ernment to help undermine the 2020
election, the House carried out its duty
to investigate a potential abuse of
power; but the President refused to co-
operate and forbade his administration
from doing so, obstructing Congress
from carrying out our sworn responsi-
bility.
If these actions bear no consequence,
future Presidents may act without con-
straint and American democracy will
be at an end. Therefore, compelled by
my sworn duty to defend the Constitu-
tion, I will vote to impeach this Presi-
dent.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO), my
friend.
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I would
like to address my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle and reiterate
President Washington’s warning to the
Republic 223 years ago.
The Constitution rightly sets a high
bar for impeachment, but the integrity
of the process also depends on the abil-
ity of the legislators to vote their
minds, independent of party politics.
Removing a President is too impor-
tant and lawmakers are given too
much latitude to define ‘‘high crimes
and misdemeanors’’ for it to be any
other way. Otherwise, excessively par-
tisan politicians could overturn an
election simply because the President
is a member of the opposite and oppos-
ing party.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H12156 December 18, 2019
It is in regard to this impeachment
process that George Washington fore-
warned us as a nation at this moment
in history. When political parties ‘‘may
now and then answer popular ends,
they are likely, in the course of time
and things, to become potent engines
by which cunning, ambitious, and un-
principled men’’ and women ‘‘will be
enabled to subvert the power of the
people to usurp for themselves the
reins of government. . . . ’’
How wise he was.
Vote ‘‘no’’ on this assault to our Re-
public, the Constitution, and against
President Trump.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, John
Adams warned in a letter to Thomas
Jefferson that these risks are unavoid-
able and might sometimes overlap:
‘‘You are apprehensive of foreign inter-
ference, intrigue, influence. So am I—
but, as often as elections happen, the
danger of foreign influence recurs.’’
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs.
LAWRENCE).
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker,
today, history is being written. The
facts are conclusive: The President at-
tempted to use the power of the power-
ful Office of President to force Ukraine
to influence our 2020 election.
In the process, President Trump jeop-
ardized our national security and with-
held vital military assistance intended
to prevent further Russian aggression
in the region.
However, as our committees—includ-
ing the Committee on Oversight and
Reform, of which I am a member—
sought to interview additional wit-
nesses and obtain documents, the
President ordered, from the power of
his office, that the executive branch
not participate and obstructed the con-
gressional oversight.
Article I provides the House of Rep-
resentatives with the sole power of im-
peachment, as well as the authority to
conduct oversight of the executive
branch.
What did he have to hide?
When the Framers met over 200 years
ago, they went to great lengths to en-
sure future Presidents will be forced to
answer to their constitutional respon-
sibility. I stand today in support of the
two Articles of Impeachment.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. CLINE).
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, today is
a sad day for this body, for the voters
who sent me here last November, and
for our Nation.
Benjamin Franklin cautioned, when
asked what he had given us: ‘‘A repub-
lic, if you can keep it.’’
Today, we take a step further toward
losing the Republic that our Founding
Fathers envisioned by engaging in ac-
tivity that they specifically warned
against: the misuse of the constitu-
tional power of impeachment for one
party’s political gain.
Our Constitution is the very founda-
tion of our Republic. Its assurance of
self-determination has been the shining
beacon by which our Nation has char-
tered its course over the last two cen-
turies.
From a new democratic experiment
struggling to survive to the greatest
Nation on Earth, America has been
powered, over the years, not by govern-
ment, but by the ingenuity, the brav-
ery, and the faith of its people, con-
fident in their place as one nation
under God, indivisible, with liberty and
justice for all.
So it is we the people who determine
our President, not we the Judiciary
Committee nor we the Congress. The
Constitution is clear. It is only when
we see clear proof of the impeachable
offenses outlined in Article II, Section
4, treason, bribery, or other high
crimes and misdemeanors, that we are
to challenge the decision of the voters,
break the figurative glass, and pull the
emergency rip cord that is impeach-
ment.
We do not have that proof today.
Thomas Jefferson said: ‘‘I know no safe
depository of the ultimate powers of
the society but the people themselves;
and if we think them not enlightened
enough to exercise their control with a
wholesome discretion, the remedy is
not to take it from them, but to inform
their discretion by education.’’
But rather than educate, this major-
ity has chosen today to obfuscate with
hearsay, innuendo, and speculation.
And when history looks back on this
shameful period for this House, it will
judge it for what it truly is: the ugly
hijacking, by the majority, of our Con-
stitution and the powers it so solemnly
entrusts to us to engage in a blatantly
political process designed to finally
achieve what they could not achieve at
the ballot box: the removal of a duly
elected President.
Compelled by my sworn duty to up-
hold this Constitution and for the peo-
ple, I vote ‘‘no’’ on impeachment
today.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
California (Mr. HUFFMAN).
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, as
we take this solemn, necessary step of
impeaching President Trump, my Re-
publican colleagues have made up their
minds. We can’t persuade them to do
the right thing, so I will address my re-
marks to the future.
Today’s vote will be judged by future
generations, including my precious
children, Abby and Nathan—maybe
grandkids.
Historians will study what Members
of this Congress did when our democ-
racy was tested like never before by a
President who put personal interests
above country, who compromised na-
tional security to cheat his way to re-
election and, when caught, not only
lied and refused to admit wrongdoing,
but flouted Congress’ authority. He
even called the constitutional im-
peachment mechanism unconstitu-
tional.
Historians will marvel how some
Members of Congress continued to
stand by this man; how they put blind,
partisan loyalty or fear of Donald
Trump above their duty to defend the
Constitution; how they made absurd
partisan arguments and tried to ob-
struct these proceedings; and how, in-
stead of pushing back when their party
fell under the dark spell of
authoritarianism, they embraced it as
if the Constitution, the rule of law, and
our oath of office mean nothing.
Madam Speaker, for our future gen-
erations, our children, the judgment of
history, let me be clear: I stand with
our Constitution, with the rule of law
and our democracy. I will be voting
‘‘yes’’ to impeach Donald J. Trump.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS).
Mr. WILLIAMS. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding me
time.
Today’s vote to impeach the duly
elected President of the United States
is truly historical. However, its unique
place in history is not for the reasons
the Democratic Party and their main-
stream media overlords are so des-
perately trying to convey.
Today, will be remembered as the
day that the Democrats, claiming a
false moral supremacy over the desire
of the American people, executed a de-
liberate and orchestrated plan to over-
turn a Presidential election.
It will be the first time in history
that a party paraded out their Ivy
League academics to explain to 31
States and almost 63 million people
that their voice should not be heard
and why their votes should not be
counted.
I pray for our Nation every day, but
today, I am praying for my colleagues
across the aisle who arrived at this
partisan and self-directed fork in the
road and chose the road never before
traveled and one that has a dead end.
Donald J. Trump is our President,
chosen by the American people, fair
and square. As we say in Texas: ‘‘It’s a
done deal.’’ Democrats’ attempt to
change history will never undo that.
May God bless the greatest country
in the world, the United States of
America.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
would remind the gentleman that the
impeachment clause is placed in the
Constitution to protect the American
people and our form of government
against a President who would subvert
our constitutional liberties in between
elections.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the distinguished gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN).
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise.
Madam Speaker, I rise because I love
my country, and, Madam Speaker,
‘‘Shall any man be above justice?’’
That is the question posed in 1787 by
George Mason at the Constitutional
Convention.
Shall any man be beyond justice?

lowed to thwart the efforts of Congress

with a legitimate impeachment in-
quiry, the President will not only be
above the law, he will be beyond jus-
tice. We cannot allow any person to be
beyond justice in this country.
In the name of democracy, on behalf
of the Republic, and for the sake of the
many who are suffering, I will vote to
impeach, and I encourage my col-
leagues to do so as well.
No one is beyond justice in this coun-
try.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I also remind my chairman
that the impeachment was not to be
used between election cycles to defeat
a sitting President who you think will
be reelected.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentleman from Florida (Mr.
BUCHANAN).
b 1500
Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Speaker, I
will vote today against both Articles of
Impeachment because they are without
merit and setting a dangerous prece-
dent for our country. This political
vendetta is an abuse of the impeach-
ment process and would subvert the
votes of 63 million Americans.
Just because the President’s oppo-
nents are afraid that he will win reelec-
tion is no excuse for weaponizing im-
peachment. No President in history has
been impeached 10 months before an
election.
Elections are the heart of our democ-
racy. Our Founding Fathers devised a
simple way to remove a President if
you disagree with him. It is called an
election, and we have one coming up in
less than a year.
Madam Speaker, let’s let the people
decide this next November.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB).
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in support of impeachment. I
learn so much every single day from
my residents at home. Their common
sense and understanding of what is
right and wrong is centered on why
they oppose any person using the most
powerful position in the world for per-
sonal gain.
We honor our veterans in this Cham-
ber almost on a daily basis. Do we ever
follow their lead, where we serve the
people of the United States and uphold
the Constitution, not as Republicans or
Democrats, but as Americans?
We should learn from their sense of
duty and responsibility to country and
democracy, not political party. Doing
nothing here, Madam Speaker, is not
an option. Looking away from these
crimes against our country is not an
option.
This is about protecting the future of
our Nation and our democracy from
corruption, abuse of power, criminal
coverups, and bribery.
Madam Speaker, this vote is also for
my sons and the future of so many gen-
erations. I urge my colleagues to please
vote ‘‘yes’’ on these Articles of Im-
peachment.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE).
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam
Speaker, I rise today on this dark day
in the United States House of Rep-
resentatives to voice my opposition to
the shameful impeachment process
that has occurred in the people’s
House.
Some of my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle do not like President
Trump. We know this because they
proudly boasted about their intention
to impeach our President before he was
even sworn into office.
Out of disdain for the President and
for those of us who elected him, the
House of Representatives is considering
two Articles of Impeachment that are
so very weak that they even fail to in-
clude specific crimes.
The people that I represent in south–
central and southwestern Pennsylvania
know the truth. The American people
know the truth. This impeachment cir-
cus has never been about the facts.
This process has always been about
seeking revenge for the President’s
election in 2016 and attempting to pre-
vent him from winning again in 2020.
Madam Speaker, I wholeheartedly
oppose this partisan and shameful ef-
fort to impeach our democratically and
duly elected President.
Madam Speaker, for the sake of our
Nation, I urge my colleagues to join
with me and vote ‘‘no’’ on the Articles
of Impeachment.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, all
we keep hearing from the other side
are attacks on the process and ques-
tions of our motives. We do not hear,
because we cannot hear, because they
cannot articulate a real defense of the
President’s actions.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentlewoman from Massachusetts
(Ms. PRESSLEY).
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to protect our democracy.
Today, we take a stand against corrup-
tion and abuses of power.
What we are doing here today is not
only patriotic, it is uniquely American.
America is a story of ordinary people
confronting abuses of power with a
steadfast pursuit of justice.
Throughout our history, the op-
pressed have been relegated to the mar-
gins by the powerful, and each time we
have fought back, deliberate in our ap-
proach, clear-eyed.
Each generation has fought for the
preservation of our democracy, and
that is what brings us to the House
floor today. Efficient and effective in
the pursuit of our truth.
Congress has done its due diligence.
Today we send a clear message. We will
not tolerate abuses of power from the
President of the United States of
America. The future of this Nation
rests in our hands.
Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy
heart, but a resolved one, and because
I believe our democracy is worth fight-
ing for, I will vote to impeach Donald
J. Trump, and I urge my colleagues to
do the same.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
The chairman hears us. He doesn’t
want to acknowledge it. When you
have nothing but a process that was
completely amuck, you talk about
process. I have already debunked the
facts many times. Let’s do it one more
time.
No pressure by either Mr. Trump or
Mr. Zelensky. In fact, what really just
horrifies me is they continue to say
that Mr. Zelensky, who is the supposed
victim here, said many times there was
no pressure. The Democrats are calling
him a liar and weakening him in his
own country. That is deplorable.
There is no conditionality in the
transcript or conditionality after that.
Five meetings prove that. They were
all high-level meetings. No condition-
ality. Two of those meetings were after
the Ukrainians actually knew of the
possibility that aid was being held.
They have not ever addressed the
truths and the facts. After there was
nothing done to get the money, guess
what? They got the money. That is the
fact. That is what they don’t want to
deal with. That is where we are today.
So let’s continue to see how the sham
was perpetrated. That is what many of
our Members are talking about.
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes
to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.
BERGMAN).
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in opposition to the Articles
of Impeachment against President
Trump. I believe all American people
need to be looked in the eye by all
their Representatives.
Today is the culmination of the
Democrats’ 3-year-long quest to
delegitimize the President. This has
been in the works since November 2016
and was all but promised when the
Democrats took the majority.
This sham process began without a
formal vote in the House and was con-
tinued over these past several months,
willfully trampling on decades of bipar-
tisan precedent—no due process;
closed-door depositions, even though
nothing in this investigation was clas-
sified; and leaking only details that fit
their narrative.
If this isn’t partisan politics, I don’t
know what is. Holding our elected offi-
cials accountable is a job I take ex-
tremely seriously, but the impeach-
ment votes today represent the worst

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H12158 December 18, 2019
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. BARRAGÁN).
Ms. BARRAGÁN. Madam Speaker, it
is with a solemn sense of duty that I
rise today in support of impeachment.
As this Chamber debates two Articles
of Impeachment against the President
for his abuse of power and obstruction
of Congress, I want history to know
that I stood up to say that I stand for
the Constitution and our democracy.
When my immigrant mom became a
United States citizen, she took an oath
of allegiance to our country and Con-
stitution. When I stood on this floor as
a new Member of Congress, I took an
oath to uphold and defend our Con-
stitution.
The President abused his power when
he used his official office and power to
ask a foreign government to interfere
in our elections. When he asked a for-
eign government for a personal favor to
dig up dirt on his political opponent so
he could cheat, the President got
caught, and then he tried to cover it
up.
Today we say no more. Today we say
we will not allow this President to
abuse his power and endanger our na-
tional security. I stand to say that no
one is above the law, not even this
President.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
PERRY).
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, since
before inauguration, the press and
Members of this Congress have been for
impeachment. Members refused to at-
tend the inauguration. They called for
impeachment, and they voted for im-
peachment without any evidence. They
voted for impeachment creating and
manufacturing evidence.
Recall and votes of no confidence are
not included in our Constitution for a
reason. Our system demands evidence
of high crimes and misdemeanors. If
such evidence existed, there would be
an agreement in this Chamber, but
there is not. There is not an agreement
because there is no evidence.
Madison and Hamilton warned us
that this might happen and that im-
peachment would veer toward political
factions, and that is exactly what this
is. This is bitterly and nakedly par-
tisan.
My colleagues on the other side of
the aisle have made a mockery of this
process and this government. They de-
spise the President and are themselves
abusing the power of their office all to
settle the political score they were un-
able to resolve at the ballot box.
Madam Speaker, they hope that if
they repeat them over and over and
stay on message that you will believe
their charges. Repeating things that
are not true does not make them true.
The call record between the two
Presidents was clear: President Trump
was interested in getting to the bottom
of what happened in the 2016 election.
He asked the Ukrainians to work with
our Attorney General. The Ukrainians
were already getting the military hard-
ware, and they got the assistance
money and the meeting they desired.
These are not crimes. These are dis-
agreements over foreign policy and the
fact that this President is conducting
it.
If it weren’t so sad, it would be
laughable, Madam Speaker. My col-
leagues are not driven by a quest for
facts or truth; they are driven by their
partisan animus and a timetable. These
are the reckless and irresponsible acts
of elitists in the swamp, and they un-
dermine the fabric of our Republic.
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume to remind the gentleman that
there is, in fact, extensive direct evi-
dence—including the President’s own
words and actions—which is corrobo-
rated and supported by indirect and
circumstantial evidence.
The record leaves the following key
facts indisputable: President Trump’s
personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, pushed
Ukraine to investigate Vice President
Biden and a debunked conspiracy the-
ory about the 2016 elections.
President Trump directed U.S. offi-
cials and President Zelensky himself to
work with Mr. Giuliani to fulfill his de-
mands.
President Trump withheld critical
military aid for Ukraine.
And President Trump stonewalled
Congress’ investigation to cover up his
misconduct.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.
CASTEN).
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, this should not be a partisan
vote. This is a vote about America. It
is a vote about our democracy and our
oath to the Constitution.
We all took an oath to protect the
Constitution against all enemies, for-
eign and domestic. We all know that
what President Trump did was wrong.
We all know it is wrong to withhold
foreign aid for a political favor. We
know it is wrong to ignore congres-
sional subpoenas. We know it is wrong
to default to silly partisan and process
arguments rather than to rise and de-
fend this beautiful, but all too fragile,
democracy.
When those in elected power abuse
their position for personal advantage,
it is on us to somberly uphold and de-
fend the responsibility that the Found-
ers bestowed on us.
So, when my colleague talks about
partisanship, I would remind him of
those great words of Lincoln. I am
paraphrasing him slightly:
When one party would inflame par-
tisanship rather than let the Nation
survive, I am proud to be the party
that would accept partisanship rather
than let the Nation perish.
So in this moment the answer is
clear, not because we want to impeach
but because we must.
So, Madam Speaker, when you vote
in a few hours, don’t vote your party;
vote your character. That is how you
are going to be judged, and that is how
we are all going to be judged.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I inquire how much time is
remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 1 hour and
441⁄2 minutes remaining. The gentleman
from New York has 1 hour and 471⁄2
minutes remaining.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman
from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON).
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Speaker, I rise
in strong opposition to this partisan
impeachment process.
Make no mistake, this process did
not begin with the whistleblower re-
port. In fact, impeachment efforts
began shortly after the President was
elected. The theatrics and political
posturing that have ensued are not
part of an effort that this body is actu-
ally pursuing to preserve checks and
balances, rather, this process echoes
the calls by some who refuse to accept
the 2016 election results.
Neither of the articles receiving a
vote justify the removal of the Presi-
dent from office. The first article sug-
gests that the President pressured a
foreign government to be able to assist
in an upcoming election. Ukraine re-
ceived its aid without a prearranged
agreement, proving this article to be
an unsubstantiated allegation.
The second article is premised that
obstruction occurred when the White
House ignored subpoenas issued by the
House. Our Federal courts are the ulti-
mate arbiters of these decisions. In
fact, previous administrations, Repub-
lican and Democrat both, have dealt
with these issues and claimed execu-
tive privilege.
Madam Speaker, the articles that are
before this House are unsubstantiated.
I intend to vote ‘‘no’’ on these articles,
and I encourage my colleagues to do
the same.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO).
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker,
today I will vote to impeach President
Donald Trump for abuse of power and
obstruction of Congress.
Those still defending the President’s
actions are desperately grasping at
straws while living in an alternate uni-
verse where facts do not exist.
b 1515
To those still unwilling to search
their souls, ask yourselves: Would you
support a Democratic President using
taxpayer dollars to pressure a foreign
government to investigate a Repub-
lican political opponent based on false
Russian conspiracy theories?
Of course not. That is absurd.
Any President who does that has
abused the power of the Presidency for
personal gain and undermined our most
sacred tradition: our elections.

make a choice. Will you fall into the

age-old political trap of thinking blind
partisanship is all that matters? Will
you vote to defend the Constitution
and our democracy so that President
Trump and every future President will
know that they are not above the law
and will be held accountable for their
actions?
I have made my choice. I hope every
Member puts the defense of our Nation
first and joins me.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Nebraska (Mr. SMITH).
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to speak out
against this attempt to remove the
duly elected President of the United
States.
Impeachment is importantly estab-
lished in our Constitution. The im-
peachment of a President has only hap-
pened twice in our country’s 243-year
history. Yet, today, for highly political
purposes, the House majority is trying
to remove President Trump from office
based on secondhand, indirect ac-
counts.
The Articles of Impeachment we are
voting on today offer no evidence of a
crime but, instead, are purposely broad
to fit the majority’s narrative.
Less than 1 year until the next Presi-
dential election, we are being asked to
override the choice of the American
people. This lopsided, hyperpartisan,
biased impeachment process has been
predetermined as an outcome from the
very beginning.
This is an unfortunate day in the his-
tory of our great country. We must
hope this political game does not set a
precedent of which to follow in the fu-
ture.
Surely, there will be disagreements
between the President and Congress for
many years to come. Instead of unnec-
essarily dividing our country, as we are
seeing today, we should be looking at
ways to bring our country together.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker,
President Trump’s actions are both im-
peachable and criminal. Although the
violation of the Federal criminal stat-
ute is neither necessary nor sufficient
to justify impeachment, President
Trump’s conduct violated the Federal
antibribery statute very clearly.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.
BEYER).
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, today,
I vote to impeach President Donald
Trump for abuse of power and obstruc-
tion of Congress. I don’t hate the Presi-
dent, but I love my country, and I have
no other choice.
Voting for these Articles of Impeach-
ment is the only moral course of ac-
tion, the only way to honor our oath of
office.
I have no doubt that the votes I cast
today will stand the test of time. This
has nothing to do with the 2016 elec-
tions.
I am so disappointed that my Repub-
lican friends approve of the President’s
abuses of power and solicitation of for-
eign interference in our elections. This
is the very definition of the willful sus-
pension of disbelief. They know in their
hearts that what the President has
done is deeply wrong. They know that
they would vote without hesitation to
impeach a Democratic President who
had done these things.
I remind all Americans, the Presi-
dent did not rebut the facts—the many,
many facts—which have led to these
Articles of Impeachment today.
For the sake of our democracy, our
Constitution, and our country, we must
do the right thing and vote to impeach
President Trump.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I am just amazed by what the
chairman just said. If it was obvious
that he violated the bribery statute
clearly, then why didn’t we add it as an
Article of Impeachment?
The reason why? It didn’t.
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes
to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.
GUEST).
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, Article
II, Section 4 of the United States Con-
stitution states that the President of
the United States may be removed
from office for treason, bribery, or high
crimes and misdemeanors.
As a former prosecutor, I am con-
fident that no court would accept these
Articles of Impeachment as having met
the standards set forth by our Found-
ing Fathers. The impeachment articles
rely almost exclusively on hearsay and
opinion testimony, and they present no
direct evidence of wrongdoing.
As a former district attorney, I am
dismayed that the Democrats have sub-
mitted Articles of Impeachment
against a sitting President using cir-
cumstantial evidence that fails to offer
proof of an impeachable offense.
Additionally, the charges levied
against the President in the Articles of
Impeachment lack historical precedent
and are motivated by pure political
reason. If the House of Representatives
passes the Articles of Impeachment,
the Democrats will have set a dan-
gerous precedent by undoing America’s
vote for President because a single
party disagreed with the 2016 Presi-
dential election results.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the Articles of
Impeachment.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentleman from California (Mr. THOMP-
SON).
Mr. THOMPSON of California.
Madam Speaker, I find no pleasure
coming to the floor today to consider
impeachment. I ran for Congress to
represent my community and to serve
the country I love.
As a combat veteran and having
served 8 years on the Intelligence Com-
mittee, I understand the threat that
foreign actors can play in our elec-
tions. Every elected official must dedi-
cate themselves to protecting our de-
mocracy. No one should invite a for-
eign country to interfere with our most
sacred act of voting.
It was abuse of power by the Presi-
dent to ask a foreign nation to inter-
fere in our election to benefit his per-
sonal and political interests and to
condition bipartisan, congressionally
approved aid on that interference.
Unchecked, these actions could lead
us down a path that will unravel the
fabric of our Nation.
Madam Speaker, I am saddened we
are here today, but in the interest of
defending our Nation, I will vote for
the Articles of Impeachment.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ROY).
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, our
Founders intentionally did not em-
brace recalls or votes of no confidence.
Rather, we demand from Congress evi-
dence of high crimes and mis-
demeanors.
While my colleagues are free to dis-
like the President, and while they may
reasonably view the infamous phone
call and negotiations with Ukrainians
as something less than perfect, they
are not free to impeach for something
less than a high crime and mis-
demeanor.
In just over 10 months, though, the
people are free to decide, and we should
let them.
Madam Speaker, the eyes of the
world are upon us. The press galleries
are full. Our floor is filled with Mem-
bers. When will we give the world
something better than this?
My colleagues wax eloquent about
the Constitutions they found under
mothballs. Where is the respect for the
Constitution when the people’s House
daily refuses to do its actual job while
shredding federalism and limited gov-
ernment?
Today, in Mexico, a young girl will
be abused while being trafficked to-
ward our open borders, while some yell
‘‘kids in cages’’ and play race politics
in the false name of compassion.
Today, in New York, a young mother
will be coerced into abortion by tax-
payer-funded Planned Parenthood,
while we allow the genocide of the un-
born in the false name of choice.
Today, across America, diabetics will
struggle to afford insulin due to a
healthcare system ravished by govern-
ment and insurance bureaucrats em-
powered in the false name of coverage.
Today, our children inherit $100 mil-
lion of debt an hour, borrowed in the
false name of what government can
provide.
It is this conduct by Congress failing
to do its jobs that should be im-
peached. One might ask if America
would be better off taking the first 435
names out of the phonebook to rep-
resent us in the United States House
than what is on display here today.
Today is not a dark day because the
American people know this: America is
great. Washington is broken. And we
are taking our country back

H12160 December 18, 2019
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise
today with a heavy heart. I came to
Congress to serve the great people of
Sacramento and to build a better fu-
ture for our children and grand-
children, including my grandkids,
Anna and Robby.
The facts before us are crystal clear.
We heard testimony from 17 brave pa-
triots who value our democracy and
the Constitution. They testified that
President Trump threatened to with-
hold congressionally approved money
in exchange for dirt on a political rival
and, worse, that he continues to invite
foreign powers to violate our sov-
ereignty even today.
On its face, these are impeachable of-
fenses that represent a clear and
present danger to our country. That is
why the only answer is to act now. We
need to stand together and stop Presi-
dent Trump immediately so that he
cannot violate the next election.
Madam Speaker, for the sake of our
country and our democracy, I will vote
‘‘yes’’ to impeach the President.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
SMUCKER).
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to ask my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle: How much is the
trust of the American people worth?
When the American people are dissat-
isfied with their government, the pri-
mary tool that the Constitution gives
them to make a change is their vote.
On November 8, 2016, Americans from
every part of this Nation packed the
polls to elect Donald J. Trump to be
the President of the United States. The
country wanted a disruptor, a fighter,
a dealmaker, a President who would
put America first.
Sadly, on that very same day, Demo-
crats had no plan or interest in hon-
oring the vote of the American people.
They were going to attempt, from day
one, to delegitimize this President and,
ultimately, remove him from office.
Right after the President was sworn
in, The Washington Post wrote: ‘‘The
campaign to impeach President Trump
has begun.’’ Even before he took office,
a Politico article headline read: ‘‘Could
Trump Be Impeached Shortly After He
Takes Office?’’
House Democrats have been planning
for this day since January 2017. It is
clear that facts have never mattered to
the House Democrats. They never
planned to work with the President. In-
stead, they intended only to fulfill
their divisive partisan agenda.
Again, I ask, how much is the trust
of the American people worth? Because
after the vote today, for what you
think is a short-term partisan gain,
you can be sure that the American peo-
ple will have lost their trust in our in-
stitution; they will have lost their
trust in Congress; and most impor-
tantly, they will have lost trust that
their vote counts.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
California (Mr. GARAMENDI).
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker,
impeaching a President is one of the
most solemn and consequential deci-
sions the United States Congress can
make. It is not an action that I or my
fellow House colleagues take lightly.
Investigations and hearings con-
ducted by the House provide over-
whelming evidence that President
Trump abused his power and endan-
gered our national security.
President Trump also issued a blan-
ket order prohibiting all executive of-
fice personnel from testifying, respond-
ing to subpoenas, or turning over docu-
ments. Therefore, he has obstructed
the legitimate and constitutional obli-
gation of Congress.
The President’s actions leave me no
choice. President Trump violated his
oath of office. Now, I will uphold my
oath of office to preserve and protect
our Constitution and my promise to
my constituents to carefully analyze
all issues before me. I will vote in favor
of both Articles of Impeachment
against President Donald John Trump.
Madam Speaker, impeaching a President is
one of the most solemn and consequential de-
cisions the United States Congress can make.
It is not an action I or my fellow House col-
leagues take lightly. Impeachment exists to
protect our democracy. As Alexander Hamilton
wrote in the Federalist Papers, the impeach-
ment clause in the Constitution exists to ad-
dress ‘‘the misconduct of public men,’’ which
involves ‘‘the abuse or violation of some public
trust.’’
The investigations and hearings conducted
by the House Intelligence and Judiciary Com-
mittees provide overwhelming evidence that
President Trump abused his power and en-
dangered our national security when he co-
erced Ukraine into investigating his likely rival
in the 2020 election by withholding $391 mil-
lion in critical military aid and a White House
meeting from the Ukrainian government. With-
holding this military assistance to Ukraine as it
enters the fifth year of its deadly war against
Russia endangers Ukraine’s sovereignty and
safety as well as the United States’ national
security interests.
President Trump has also issued a blanket
order prohibiting all executive office personnel
from testifying in Congressional impeachment
hearings, responding to subpoenas and turn-
ing over documents. Therefore, he has ob-
structed the legitimate and Constitutional obli-
gation Congress has to conduct an impeach-
ment inquiry when there is evidence of wrong-
doing by the President.
No one is above the law. The President’s
actions leave me no choice. President Trump
has violated his oath to ‘‘faithfully execute the
Office of the President of the United States,’’
and to, ‘‘preserve, protect and defend the
Constitution of the United States against all
enemies foreign and domestic.’’ Now I will up-
hold my Oath of Office to preserve and protect
our Constitution and my promise to my con-
stituents to carefully analyze all issues before
me. I will vote in favor of both articles of im-
peachment against President Donald John
Trump.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN).
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I stand
before you today a disappointed man. I
am disappointed in a broken and par-
tisan process that has consumed House
Democrats.
We were told this investigation was
going to be bipartisan and transparent.
Instead, the proceedings were held in
secret behind closed doors with no at-
tempt at a fair hearing.
All this was done deliberately in an
effort to undo the results of the 2016
election.
Madam Speaker, my constituents in
Florida want to see us get to work.
They are counting on us to actually fix
the surprise medical billing, to lower
the cost of prescription drugs. Instead,
we are here a week before Christmas,
voting to impeach the legitimate
President, Donald J. Trump, on the
strength of nothing but rumors.
We have wasted almost a year on this
process while House Democrats chose
political theater over serving the
American people. This shameful vote
to impeach our President will be a last-
ing stain on our House.
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no.’’
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO).
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, it is
clear-cut. The President of the United
States has violated his oath of office
and betrayed the Constitution and the
American people.
He admitted to soliciting assistance
from a foreign leader to interfere in the
U.S. election and aid his political re-
election campaign. That is a violation
of law, a violation of the Constitution,
a betrayal of the American people, and
an impeachable offense.
Overwhelming evidence also dem-
onstrates the President withheld con-
gressionally approved taxpayer dollars
to blackmail the young, new President
of Ukraine under attack from Russia.
The gentleman from Georgia says
Ukraine didn’t feel any pressure. They
are being invaded by Russia, Vladimir
Putin, you know, Trump’s friend. He
withheld that aid until the whistle-
blower report came out, then the aid
was released. It wasn’t released for any
good purpose.
Congress voted for that aid; the
President signed the bill. That is an-
other impeachable offense.
The Committee on the Judiciary has
put together an extensive document
which shows that there is evidence of
numerous other Federal crimes, includ-
ing bribery and wire fraud.
Madam Speaker, the President’s ac-
tions threaten the continuation of our
representative democracy. I am proud-
ly voting for impeachment today.

Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
I am glad to know that Mr. Trump
was giving them lethal aid, actually,
something to fight back with, not what
was previously given to them. And
there was, again, from the President,
himself, no pressure put on him.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H12161
December 18, 2019
Your whole case is sort of destroyed
if you are coercing somebody if there
was no pressure felt; yet, we don’t seem
to get that part on this floor debate
today.
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes
to the gentleman from Montana (Mr.
GIANFORTE).
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker,
today this Chamber is pushing through
the most partisan, baseless Articles of
Impeachment in our history.
House Democrats’ hyperpartisan im-
peachment has been a sham since day
one, driven by those whose bitter rage
against President Trump has blinded
their better judgment.
The fact is they resolved to overturn
the results of the 2016 election the day
President Trump won. Earlier this
year, Speaker PELOSI said: ‘‘Impeach-
ment is so divisive to the country that
unless there’s something so compelling
and overwhelming and bipartisan, I
don’t think we should go down that
path.’’
None of those standards have been
met—none.
The committee hearings were a
scripted, substance-free, made-for-TV
show. They would be comedy if im-
peachment weren’t so serious and
grave. Witnesses denied awareness of
an impeachable offense. And because
the majority has failed to make the
case for impeachment, there is no bi-
partisanship.
Compelling? Overwhelming? Bipar-
tisan? Speaker PELOSI has not met her
own criteria for impeachment, but here
we are. Despite Democrats testing and
tweaking their impeachment message,
the American people have rejected it.
I will vote against this partisan im-
peachment sham. Let’s get back to the
work that the American people sent us
here to do on this sad day of an im-
peachment charade.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GONZALEZ).
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam
Speaker, I rise on a sad day for Amer-
ica, a sad day for Texas, and a very sad
day for the people I represent. I am not
gleeful for today.
I came to Congress to lower the costs
of prescription drugs, fight for a debt-
free education, and improve the care of
special-needs children, our seniors, and
our veterans.
I did not come to Congress to im-
peach a sitting President, but we have
been given no choice. He has eroded the
foundations of our democracy and used
the office of the Presidency for per-
sonal and political gain.
Our Founding Fathers feared that
one day the power of the Presidency
would stretch beyond its limits; thus,
they enshrined in the Constitution a
system of checks and balances.
We cannot and will not lower the eth-
ical standards of our Presidency. We
cannot afford to wither like a cheap
flower in bad weather, watching our de-
mocracy crumble and rot from within.
That is not the America the world
knows and loves, and it is certainly not
the America we would be proud to have
our future generations inherit. And
that is why, today, I must vote to im-
peach the President of the United
States and fulfill my oath to the Con-

Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. HURD).
Mr. HURD of Texas. Madam Speaker,
throughout this process, the American
people have learned of bungling foreign
policy decisions, but we have not heard
evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, of
bribery or extortion. Allegations of
these two crimes aren’t even men-
tioned in the Articles of Impeachment
being debated today.
Today, we have seen a rushed process
divide our country. Today, accusations
have been hurled at each other, ques-
tioning one another’s integrity. Today,
a dangerous precedent will be set: im-
peachment becoming a weaponized po-
litical tool.
We know how this partisan process
will end this evening, but what happens
tomorrow? Can this Chamber put down
our swords and get back to work for
the American people?
This institution has a fabled history
of passing legislation that has not only
changed our country, but has inspired
the world. This feat has been possible
because this experiment we call Amer-
ica has one perpetual goal: make a
more perfect Union.
We can contribute to this history if
we recognize the simple fact that way
more unites our country than divides
us. Tomorrow, can we start focusing on
that?
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS).
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, this is, indeed, a sad
day for our country. This is, indeed, a
sad day for America. But it is a good
day for our Constitution.
It is a sad day for our country be-
cause President Trump has defied our
Constitution, our rules, our require-
ments, and our expectations.
It is clear that President Trump
places himself above the law, above our
Constitution, and above the expecta-
tions of the American people.
At my last townhall meeting, which
was held Saturday, December 15, at
Malcolm X College in Chicago, some-
one asked the question: What is our po-
sition on impeachment?
Madam Speaker, every person there
rose and said: Impeach.
When I speak, I speak for the people
of the Seventh District of Illinois, and
my vote will be impeach, impeach, im-
peach.
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GOHMERT).
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, in
1998, Senator SCHUMER said: ‘‘This im-
peachment will be used as a routine
tool to fight political battles.’’
We thought it was a prediction. It
was a promise, and now it is playing
out. That is exactly what is being done
here.
And for those who say we don’t ad-
dress the defenses of fact, here you go.
The impeachment served two purposes:
Number one, stop the investigation
by the U.S. Department of Justice and
Ukraine into the corruption of Ukraine
interference into the U.S. election in
2016.
You have said this was about, oh,
this terrible Russia collusion. Oh, then
that fell through. It is about emolu-
ments. It is about bribery. It is about
extortion. It has changed.
But one thing hasn’t changed, and
that is the intent to impeach this
President. It has always been there.
But let’s be honest. The President
turning his back on Ukraine, that hap-
pened in 2009, because in 2008 Ukraine
invaded Georgia.
What happened? Bush put sanctions
on Russia to teach them a lesson.
What happened after that? Well, in
March of 2009, Hillary Clinton was sent
over to Russia with a reset button to
say: Bush overreacted. We are okay
that you invaded Georgia.
It was a green light to Russia to in-
vade Ukraine.
And what do you do? Oh, yeah, you
send blankets and MREs. They can eat
and be warm while the Russians are
killing them. That is what the Obama
administration did.
This is a travesty, and we are in big
trouble because SCHUMER was right.
Now it has lowered the bar even far-
ther. It will be used for political bat-
tles, and this country’s end is now in
sight. I hope I don’t live to see it.
This is an outrage.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I am
deeply concerned that any Member of
the House would spout Russian propa-
ganda on the floor of the House.
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from New York (Mr. HIGGINS).
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam
Speaker, the United States Constitu-
tion is explicit: Bribery is an impeach-
able offense.
Bribery involves the abuse of power,
and the President of the United States
abused the power of his office by solic-
iting a bribe of a foreign leader to
interfere in an election that he was
afraid he could not win honorably, fair-
ly, or freely: You, President of
Ukraine, open and announce an inves-
tigation of my political rival, and I,
President of the United States, will re-
lease $391 million in military aid and
give you the stature-amplifying White
House meeting that you need.
This is a this-for-that, something-for-
something transaction. Soliciting a
bribe from a foreign leader is an abuse
of power and a Federal crime.
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman
from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS).
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I
want to thank my Republican col-
leagues who have toiled honorable in
defense of the Constitution and the
rule of law under difficult cir-
cumstances. Madam Speaker, it is a

darn shame that we have found our-
selves in this position today.
Every time I step into this Chamber,
I am humbled to be serving in the
greatest legislative body in the history
of the world. However, it is deeply dis-
appointing that the hyperpartisanship
that has gripped this country has made
its way into this Chamber.
I pride myself on being a consensus
builder who works across the aisle to
get things done for the American peo-
ple, but when it comes to the matter of
impeachment, I have no doubt that the
entire process has been politically mo-
tivated.
There is absolutely no evidence that
President Trump committed an im-
peachable offense, which is why I will
vote ‘‘no.’’
This whole process has been a ploy to
circumvent the will of the people by re-
moving a duly elected President of the
United States. It is a national disgrace,
and it sets a dangerous precedent.
But we are a great nation, and we
will survive this indignity. Let’s put
this ugly chapter behind us, Madam
Speaker, and get to work.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON).
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Madam Speaker, the question that will
be answered today is: Will Members
honor their oath to uphold the Con-
stitution?
Democrats are not supporting im-
peachment based on a policy disagree-
ment or the election results of 2016. No
one is above the law. The President
must be held accountable.
A constitutional process is not a
hoax or a witch hunt. President Trump
just opposes it. No one is above the
law, not even President Donald J.
Trump.
The President abused his power by
pressuring Ukraine to help his reelec-
tion campaign. Impeachment is a con-
stitutional remedy for these actions.
Trump betrayed his oath, betrayed
the Constitution, and undermined the
integrity of our elections. Those who
are against the impeachment inquiry
are willing to turn a blind eye to con-
stitutional violations by the President.
As a nation, we have no other alter-
native. We must protect our Constitu-
tion and the United States of America.
In his own words: ‘‘No intelligent
person believes what he is saying.’’
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman
from Indiana (Mr. BAIRD).
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, the to-
tality of this process is just another re-
minder that my colleagues across the
aisle are more focused on politics than
policy. The American people deserve
better. Our Republic deserves better.
The brave men and women of our
military, myself included, have fought
for freedom and democracy all around
the world. Yet, today, my colleagues
are eroding those freedoms through a
process that ignored facts, abused
power, and was shrouded in secrecy.
Those facts could not be more clear:
The President committed no crime,
broke no laws, and there was no quid
pro quo.
I look forward to doing the right
thing, representing the Hoosiers in my
district, and voting against this im-
peachment charade. I stand with Presi-
dent Trump and look forward to pass-
ing policies that continue to move our
country forward.

Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER).
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker,
thanks to the hard work of our com-
mittees and the leadership of the
Speaker, we found overwhelming evi-
dence Trump invited foreign interests
to interfere in our elections for his per-
sonal gain, and then he took unprece-
dented efforts to cover it up, obstruct-
ing Congress.
I am proud of the courage of new
Members to do their duty, so that, for
the first time in his privileged life,
Donald Trump will be finally held ac-
countable for his reckless personal be-
havior and business practices.
I vote proudly for these two Articles
of Impeachment. And then I hope the
House retains control of the articles
until the Speaker and Leader SCHUMER
can negotiate an agreement on process
and witnesses from MCCONNELL so that
the next stage will be open and fair so
that Donald Trump will ultimately be
held accountable.
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman
from Oklahoma (Mr. KEVIN HERN).
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Pub-
lic hearings began November 13. Less
than a month later, Speaker PELOSI an-
nounced Articles of Impeachment on
December 5, saying the investigation
had revealed enough information to
move forward with impeachment.
Let’s think about that 22-day inves-
tigation. Six of those days were week-
ends where hearings weren’t hap-
pening, and the House was not in ses-
sion. Seven of those days were week-
days that the House was in recess, in-
cluding the week of Thanksgiving. Two
of those days were fly-in days, where
Congress doesn’t hold hearings. So out
of the 22 days, just 7 days were used to
investigate, debate, and vote on the
impeachment of the duly elected leader
of our country.
No wonder my constituents are
upset; 7 days to impeach the President
of the United States. Not to mention
that this 7-day investigation uncovered
zero facts in support of impeachment. I
spent every minute I had in there as an
observer of these hearings, and all I
learned is if you hate someone so
strongly and enough people agree with
you, that is grounds enough to be im-
peached.
We asked for 12 hours of debate, the
same amount of time allotted to Presi-
dent Clinton’s impeachment, 12 hours
of debate for possibly the biggest vote
I would cast in my tenure as a Rep-
resentative. It isn’t asking too much,
but, no, they want to get out of here
before Christmas, so it is okay to rush
the process.
I am ashamed to be part of this
today, even as I vote against the im-
peachment. My constituents are call-
ing every day mad as hell, saying we
should be ashamed that this historic
Chamber has fallen so low as to allow
something like this to happen.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, my friend, the gen-
tleman from Georgia, has a tagline
about the clock and the calendar.
Madam Speaker, this is not about the
clock and the calendar. It is about cor-
ruption and the Constitution. It is
about a President who abuses power to
coerce an ally to intervene in our elec-
tion and poses a continuing threat to
the integrity of our next election.
The President’s defense is built on
three pillars, and when those three pil-
lars fall, the entire defense of the
President collapses.
First, they claim there was no quid
pro quo. Well, the evidence is undis-
puted. President Trump conditioned a
White House visit and military aid on
President Zelensky’s public announce-
ment of the investigations. Ambas-
sador William Taylor wrote at the
time, ‘‘I think it’s crazy to withhold
security assistance for help with a po-
litical campaign.’’
A reporter asked White House Chief
of Staff Mick Mulvaney if there had
been a quid pro quo here, and he re-
plied, ‘‘We do that all the time. Get
over it.’’ The President refused to help
our ally until he got a personal polit-
ical favor, and so the first defense falls.
Second, the minority claims that the
Ukrainians didn’t know about the hold.
The evidence, again, is undisputed.
Ukraine knew about the hold on the
military assistance within hours of the
President’s July 25 call. Laura Cooper
of the Department of Defense testified
under oath that on July 25 the State
Department sent two emails to the De-
partment of Defense notifying them
that Ukrainian officials were asking,
Where is the aid? The Ukrainians un-
derstood exactly what President
Trump was asking. He wanted a per-
sonal political favor before the aid was
released. And so the second defense
falls.
Third, and finally, my Republican
friends say the aid was released. But
the aid was released only after the
President got caught. This House
launched its investigation on Sep-
tember 9. The hold on the aid was lifted
on September 11. This is not evidence
of innocence. It is evidence of culpa-
bility. The evidence is overwhelming.
And when the President got caught, he
did everything in his power to prevent
the American people from learning the
truth about his actions by defying the
congressional investigation, by order-
ing that all requests and demands for
information be denied.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H12163
December 18, 2019
With our national security and the
integrity of our election at risk, we
must act, not because of the clock and
the calendar, but to fight against cor-
ruption and for continued self-govern-
ment by the American people.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I
would just point out that, to believe
everything that was just said, you have
to also believe that President Zelensky
is a pathological liar.
I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman
from South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN).
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, we
are not debating impeachment of an
American President today. Your minds
are already made up. The Democrat
majority has had a verdict, impeach-
ment, looking for a crime since the in-
auguration.
The Washington Post ran the head-
line, ‘‘The Campaign to Impeach Presi-
dent Trump Has Begun’’ just 19 min-
utes after President Trump took the
oath of office.
The freshman Congresswoman from
Michigan told a group of supporters,
‘‘We are going to impeach the mother-
blank’’ shortly after she was sworn in.
Even Speaker PELOSI admitted last
week that the impeachment effort has
been going on for 21⁄2 years, long before
any phone call between two world lead-
ers.
In fact, 71 percent of the Democrats
on the Judiciary Committee supported
an impeachment before the phone call.
The impeachment sham is based on
hearsay, conjecture, and opinion. And
you know what, you can’t even get a
speeding ticket in this country based
on hearsay, yet we are going to im-
peach an American President based on
just that.
Where are the crimes of treason, high
crimes or misdemeanors committed
here? Those are things that constitute
impeachable offenses, not hatred or
policy disagreements. If memory serves
me right, Congress told the administra-
tion to withhold aid to Ukraine until
they got their act together, addressed
corruption, and straightened it out.
That was in multiple NDAAs voted on
by both parties in this Chamber.
So in the simplest terms, we are im-
peaching the President for doing some-
thing we told him to do. Give me a
break. We have wasted precious time
we were given to serve the American
people while you held secret hearings
and depositions behind closed doors in
Chairman SCHIFF’s chamber of secrets.
But the American people have a
great sense of fairness, I promise you.
They see President Trump has not been
treated fairly in this process. Impeach-
ment based on hearsay and opinion,
not facts. It is a sad day in this Cham-
ber, the people’s House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I now
inform you that the gentleman from
California (Mr. SCHIFF) the chair of the
Intelligence Committee, will now serve
as my designee and will control the re-
mainder of the time on the majority
side.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league, Chairman NADLER, for yielding,
and I thank him for the extraordinary
job that he has done as chairman of the
Judiciary Committee throughout these
difficult proceedings.
Madam Speaker, my colleagues, my
fellow Americans, I rise to support the
impeachment of President Donald J.
Trump.
‘‘When a man unprincipled in private
life desperate in his fortune, bold in his
temper, possessed of considerable tal-
ents, having the advantage of military
habits—despotic in his ordinary de-
meanor—known to have scoffed in pri-
vate at the principles of liberty—when
such a man is seen to mount the hob-
byhorse of popularity—to join in the
cry of danger to liberty—to take every
opportunity of embarrassing the gen-
eral government and bringing it under
suspicion—to flatter and fall in with
all the nonsense of the zealots of the
day—it may justly be suspected that
his object is to throw things into con-
fusion that he may ride the storm and
direct the whirlwind.’’ These are the
words of Alexander Hamilton written
in 1792. Could we find a more perfect
description of the present danger ema-
nating from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?
The Framers crafted a Constitution
that contemplated free and fair elec-
tions for the highest office in the land,
but also afforded the Congress with a
power to remove a President who
abused the powers of his office for per-
sonal gain, who compromised the pub-
lic trust by betraying our Nation’s se-
curity or who sought to undermine our
democratic system by seeking foreign
intervention in the conduct of our elec-
tions.
I would say that the Founders could
have little imagined that a single
President might have done all of these
things, except that the evidence has
sadly proved this is exactly what this
President has done. Hamilton, among
others, seems to have predicted the rise
of Donald Trump with a staggering pre-
science.
Having won freedom from a king, the
drafters of our Constitution designed a
government in which ambition was
made to check ambition, in which no
branch of government would predomi-
nate over another, and no man would
be allowed to be above the law, includ-
ing the President, especially the Presi-
dent, since with whom would the dan-
ger be greater than with the officer
charged with being our Commander in
Chief?
Over the course of the last 3 months,
we have found incontrovertible evi-
dence that President Trump abused his
power by pressuring the newly elected
President of Ukraine to announce an
investigation into President Trump’s
political rival, Joe Biden, with the
hopes of defeating Mr. Biden in the 2020
Presidential election and enhancing his
own prospects for reelection. He didn’t
even need the investigation to be un-
dertaken, just simply announced to the
public; the smear of his opponent
would be enough.
To effectuate this scheme, President
Trump withheld two official acts of
vital importance to a nation at war
with our adversary, Vladimir Putin’s
Russia. The President withheld a White
House meeting that Ukraine des-
perately sought to bolster its standing
on the world stage. And even more per-
niciously, President Trump suspended
hundreds of millions of dollars of mili-
tary aid approved by this Congress to
coerce Ukraine into doing his electoral
dirty work.
The President of the United States
was willing to sacrifice our national se-
curity by withholding support for a
critical strategic partner at war in
order to improve his reelection pros-
pects.
But for the courage of someone will-
ing to blow the whistle, he would have
gotten away with it. Instead, he got
caught. He tried to cheat, and he got
caught.
Now, this wasn’t the first time. As a
candidate in 2016, Donald Trump in-
vited Russian interference in his presi-
dential campaign, saying at a cam-
paign rally, ‘‘Russia, if you’re listen-
ing, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000
emails that are missing,’’ a clear invi-
tation to hack Hillary Clinton’s
emails. Just 5 hours later Russian Gov-
ernment hackers tried to do exactly
that.
What followed was an immense Rus-
sian hacking and dumping operation
and a social media disinformation cam-
paign designed to help elect Donald
Trump. Not only did candidate Trump
welcome that effort, but he made full
use of it, building it into his campaign
plan and his messaging strategy. And
then he sought to cover it up.
This Russian effort to interfere in
our elections didn’t deter Donald
Trump. It empowered him. The day
after Special Counsel Bob Mueller tes-
tified before Congress about Russia’s
sweeping and systematic effort to in-
fluence the outcome of our last elec-
tion, the day after President Trump be-
lieved that the investigation into his
first electoral misconduct had come to
an end, the President was back on the
phone urging yet another country, this
time Ukraine, to help him cheat in an-
other election.
Three consecutive days in July tell
so much of the story, three consecutive
days in July of 2019:
July 24, the day that Special Counsel
Mueller testified before Congress and
President Trump thought he was fi-
nally in the clear.
July 25, the day that President
Trump got on the phone with the
Ukrainian President and, in the con-
text of a discussion about military sup-
port for that embattled nation that the
President had recently frozen, said, ‘‘I

would like you to do us a favor,
though,’’ and asked Ukraine to do two
investigations to help his reelection ef-
forts in 2020. That was July 25.
And then we come to July 26, the day
Gordon Sondland called President
Trump on his cell phone from a res-
taurant in Ukraine. Gordon Sondland,
not some anonymous ‘‘never Trump-
er,’’ but a million-dollar donor to the
President’s inauguration, and his hand-
picked ambassador to the European
Union.
b 1600
What does President Trump ask
Sondland? The day after this call, what
does President Trump ask? What does
the President want to know?
Did he ask about Ukraine’s efforts to
battle corruption? Of course not. Did
he ask how the war with Russia was
going? Not a chance.
On the phone, his voice loud enough
for others to hear, President Trump
asked Sondland, ‘‘So he is going to do
the investigation?’’ And the answer
was clear. Sondland assured Trump
that the Ukrainian president was
‘‘going to do it’’ and that ‘‘he would do
anything you ask him to.’’
Madam Speaker, I say to my col-
leagues, if that wasn’t telling enough,
in a conversation that followed, an
American diplomat dining with
Sondland asked if it was true that
President Trump didn’t give a blank
about Ukraine.
Sondland agreed, saying, the Presi-
dent cared only about ‘‘big stuff.’’
The diplomat noted that there was
big stuff in Ukraine, like a war with
Russia.
And Sondland replied that the Presi-
dent cared only about big stuff that
benefits him personally, like the
‘‘Biden investigation that Mr. Giuliani
was pushing.’’
In that short conversation, we
learned everything we need to know
about the 45th President of the United
States. He doesn’t care about Ukraine
or the impact on our national security
caused by withholding military aid to
that country fighting for its demo-
cratic life. All that matters to this
President is what affects him person-
ally: an investigation into his political
rival and a chance to cheat in the next
election.
As Professor Gerhardt testified be-
fore the Judiciary Committee 2 weeks
ago: ‘‘If what we are talking about is
not impeachable, then nothing is im-
peachable.’’
Even as this body uncovered the facts
of this Ukraine scheme, even as we
opened an impeachment inquiry, even
as we gathered evidence, President
Trump continued his efforts to seek
foreign help in the next election.
‘‘Well, I would think,’’ he said from the
White House lawn on October 3, ‘‘that,
if they are being honest about it, they
would start a major investigation into
the Bidens. It is a very simple answer,’’
he said.
And he made it clear it is an open in-
vitation to other nations as well, say-
ing, ‘‘China should start an investiga-
tion into the Bidens,’’ too.
President Trump sent his chief of
staff to the White House podium, and
he told the world that, of course, they
had linked aid to investigations, and
that we should just ‘‘get over it.’’
And even as these articles have made
their way to this House floor, the
President’s personal attorney has con-
tinued pursuing these sham investiga-
tions on behalf of his client, the Presi-
dent.
The President and his men plot on.
The danger persists. The risk is real.
Our democracy is at peril.
But we are not without a remedy pre-
scribed by the Founders for just these
circumstances: impeachment.
The only question is this: Will we use
it? Or have we fallen prey to another
evil that the Founders forewarned? The
excess of factionalism, the elevation of
party over country.
Many of my colleagues appear to
have made their choice: to protect the
President, to enable him to be above
the law, to empower this President to
cheat again as long as it is in the serv-
ice of their party and their power.
They have made their choice, despite
this President and the White House
stonewalling every subpoena, every re-
quest for witnesses and testimony from
this co-equal branch of government.
They have made their choice, know-
ing that to allow this President to ob-
struct Congress will empower him and
any other President that follows to be
as corrupt, as negligent, or as abusive
of the power of the Presidency as they
choose.
They have made their choice, and I
believe they will rue the day that they
did.
When Donald J. Trump was sworn in
on January 20, 2017, he repeated these
words: ‘‘I do solemnly swear that I will
faithfully execute the Office of the
President of the United States, and
will, to the best of my ability, pre-
serve, protect, and defend the Constitu-
tion of the United States.’’
Has he lived up to that sacred obliga-
tion? Has he honored his oath of office?
Has he preserved, protected, and de-
fended the Constitution of the United
States?
The uncontested evidence provides
the simple yet tragic answer: He has
not.
In America, no one is above the law.
Donald J. Trump sacrificed our na-
tional security in an effort to cheat in
the next election, and for that and his
continued efforts to seek foreign inter-
ference in our elections, he must be im-
peached.
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
It is nice to see you here, Chairman
SCHIFF. It would have been nice to have
either you or the whistleblower present
in either the Judiciary or the Over-
sight hearings.
I think we are continuing to neglect
the four key facts of this. The tran-
script is out. Everybody can read it.
The American people can read it. There
is no conditionality or aid discussed on
that call. The two principals on that
call, President Trump and President
Zelensky, have said there was no pres-
sure. President Zelensky has basically
screamed from the rooftops on numer-
ous occasions that there was no pres-
sure, no bribery, no quid pro quo.
The Ukrainian Government got the
money and didn’t know the aid was
being paused, and no investigation was
announced and a meeting with the
President took place, and the aid was
released.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are once again reminded to ad-
dress their remarks to the Chair.

vinces nor satisfies me.
I am from the Show Me State. You
have to show me.
The only thing that you all have
shown so far is that you are about to
impeach a duly elected President who
has done nothing wrong.
Democrats are not impeaching the
President because they are scared for
our republic or that he has committed
a crime; they are impeaching him be-
cause they fear the President’s policies
and how well they are working for the
American people. Most of all, they fear
the election, because they know they
can’t beat him.
In fact, one of my Democrat col-
leagues is quoted as stating: ‘‘I am con-
cerned if we don’t impeach him, he will
get reelected.’’
This kind of rhetoric is disgusting.
Impeachment is not a political weap-
on, and any Member who votes for im-
peachment should be ashamed today.
You cannot undo the results of the
2016 election simply because your
flawed candidate did not win.
And I thank God she didn’t.
Over the last 3 years, unemployment
has dropped to the lowest point in gen-
erations, we are seeing better trade
agreements with our trading partners,
and record numbers of taxes and regu-
lations that stifle economic growth
have been rolled back, all thanks to
President Trump’s leadership and com-
mitment.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I
yield an additional 15 seconds to the
gentleman.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam
Speaker, this is very important. We
shouldn’t be surprised. Democrats have
introduced Articles of Impeachment
against five out of our last six Repub-
lican Presidents.
They are the party of impeachment.
The Democrats are the party of im-
peachment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H12165
December 18, 2019
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Once
again, Members are admonished to ad-
dress their remarks to the Chair.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. SWALWELL).
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker,
Donald Trump is using the Presidency
to put his own personal gain above our
national interests.
He is using our taxpayer dollars and
foreign interference to cheat the next
election, and it jeopardizes our na-
tional security and integrity at the
ballot box.
Not a single fact in this case is seri-
ously in dispute.
I ask my colleagues: Who sent his
personal lawyer to Ukraine to inves-
tigate his political rival? Who fired an
ambassador who stood in his way? Who
conditioned a White House meeting on
investigations that only personally
benefited him and not the national in-
terest? Who cut off military aid to an
ally that desperately needed it? Who
pressured President Zelensky to con-
duct those investigations? Who stood
on the White House lawn and asked not
only Ukraine to investigate his rival,
but also China? Who has buried evi-
dence and blocked witnesses from tes-
tifying? And who is still today sending
his personal lawyer to Ukraine to dig
up dirt and rig an election?
The answer to all of these questions
is President Donald Trump.
This is a crime spree in progress, but
we know how to stop it: courage.
Yes, this investigation has shown us
how corrupt President Trump is, but it
has also shown us the courage of some
of our fellow patriotic civil servants,
who have used their courage to not
only stand up around the world to ex-
tinguish corruption, but also to extin-
guish it at the White House.
How so? Well, my colleagues argue:
‘‘No harm, no foul. Ukraine got the
aid.’’
Wrong. Trump cheated. Patriots
caught him. Then Ukraine got the aid.
Standing up, it turns out, works.
Now is the time to summon the cour-
age of those patriots and to summon
the courage that they showed against
Donald Trump.
If they can risk their careers, even
their lives, to do the right thing, can
my colleagues also do the same?
After all, more is on the line than
just military aid to an ally.
Our national security is at stake.
Stand up for that.
Our election integrity is at stake.
Stand up for that.
Our Constitution is at stake. Stand
up for that.
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker,
may I inquire as to how much time re-
mains on each side.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from North Dakota has 1 hour,
231⁄4 minutes remaining. The gentleman
from California has 1 hour, 18 minutes
remaining.
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I
appreciate the detail.
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes
to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOHN-
SON).
Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Madam
Speaker, this is a sad day for America.
This partisan impeachment sham seeks
to disenfranchise 63 million American
voters.
I want to use my time to call on this
Chamber, for Members to rise and ob-
serve a moment of silent reflection, to
give every Member here the chance to
pause for a moment and remember the
voices of the 63 million American vot-
ers the Democrats today are wanting
to silence.
Madam Speaker, disenfranchising 63
million voters gives me 63 million rea-
sons to vote ‘‘no’’, and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
Alabama (Ms. SEWELL).
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam
Speaker, it is with a heavy heart and a
profound sense of the gravity of this
moment that I rise today in support of
the impeachment of President Donald
J. Trump.
To be clear, I did not run for Con-
gress to impeach a President.
I come to work every day on behalf of
the hardworking people of Alabama’s
Seventh Congressional District.
But the facts are uncontested. The
truth is clear. And I have been left no
other choice.
As a member of the Intelligence
Committee, I sat in shock, in awe as
witness after witness came forward,
their stories painting a clear picture of
the President’s abuse of power.
b 1615
They testified that the President had
direct orders to withhold vital military
aid for Ukraine and a White House visit
in exchange for investigations into the
Bidens.
To date, all the military aid has not
been released, and there still has been
no White House meeting.
The bottom line is clear. President
Trump endangered our national secu-
rity and the very essence of our democ-
racy for his own personal political
gain. Then, President Trump sought to
cover it up by subverting the oversight
authority of Congress.
If Presidential abuse of power is left
unchecked, we all become accomplices
when he does it again. This cannot be-
come the new normal, not on our
watch.
While President Trump’s indefensible
actions set in motion this event, my
vote for impeachment today is not
about the President. It is about my
oath to defend and protect the Con-
stitution of this United States of
America and to make sure that I up-
hold and honor the sacred trust that
my constituents gave me.
President Trump has betrayed his
oath of office. Let us not betray ours.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I am back. I also noticed
some changes around here since I left.
I notice I have a new manager on the
other side, who, as I came back in from
getting a quick bite, I noticed gave an
eloquent defense of his side of this
story that we are telling. I just wish we
could have had that same eloquent de-
fense before the Judiciary Committee,
where he could have been asked ques-
tions instead of just giving one side.
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes
to the gentleman from Pennsylvania
(Mr. KELLER).
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, today
will forever be remembered as a stain
on our Republic.
These impeachment proceedings are
not based upon facts, evidence, reason,
or any inappropriate or impeachable
actions by our President. Instead, the
actions being taken by those favoring
impeachment are a product of their
disdain for President Trump, his Amer-
ica First agenda, and, particularly, a
disdain by the other party for the 63
million Americans who elected him as
President.
Again, these Articles of Impeach-
ment are not based on any facts but,
rather, on hearsay, presumptions, in-
nuendo, and feelings, feelings by Demo-
crats and career bureaucrats who have
wanted President Trump removed from
office since the day he was elected.
In defense of the Constitution, I urge
all Members to oppose both Articles of
Impeachment. It is unclear who will
judge those voting for impeachment
today more harshly: history or voters.
I want Democrats voting for im-
peachment today to know that I will be
praying for them from the Gospel of
Luke, the 23rd chapter, verse 34: ‘‘And
Jesus said, ‘Father, forgive them, for
they know not what they do.’’’
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, my colleagues have
referred to patriotic Americans who
testified before the Intelligence Com-
mittee as career bureaucrats. I want to
remind people just who those career
bureaucrats are.
They are people like Ambassador Bill
Taylor, who has served this country for
decades. He graduated top in his class
at West Point, served during Vietnam
in combat, and earned a Bronze Star.
They are people like Colonel
Vindman, who served in Iraq and
earned a Purple Heart.
They are people like Ambassador
Marie Yovanovitch, who served in dan-
gerous places all over the world, one of
the most respected of all of our Foreign
Service officers.
These are the people who my col-
leagues would pejoratively label as
‘‘career bureaucrats.’’ Why? Because
they have the courage to do their law-
ful duty, to answer a subpoena and to
come and testify. For this, they are
called career bureaucrats. Well, we
should have more career bureaucrats of
that caliber.
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
California (Mr. COSTA).
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise
with a heavy heart. The two most dif-
ficult votes any Member of Congress

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H12166 December 18, 2019
ever has to cast is to vote to go to war
or to impeach. Today, I will vote for
the Articles of Impeachment.
Over the last few months, I have lis-
tened carefully to my constituents. I
have weighed all the available informa-
tion to determine whether or not the
President committed any wrongdoing.
There are disturbing facts from this ad-
ministration that informed my deci-
sion, including the President’s own
words.
His handpicked Ambassador to the
European Union testified there was a
quid pro quo to withhold aid to
Ukraine for an investigation of former
Vice President Biden, and that every-
one was in the loop.
His own National Security Advisor,
John Bolton, said he wanted nothing to
do with this drug deal, as he called it.
Then, the President openly acknowl-
edged that China and Ukraine should
investigate Mr. Biden.
There is much more evidence point-
ing to the President violating his own
oath of office. I have not made this de-
cision lightly, but I must uphold my
own oath of office because I believe the
President has failed to uphold his oath
of office.
The weight of history, my belief in
the Constitution of the United States,
and our own national security interests
have led me to this vote.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I appreciate anybody who
would come and give testimony. But it
is interesting to see that the same
chairman who just spoke eloquently
about those who testified would have
to actually dismiss completely almost
anything by Mr. Volker or Mr. Morri-
son.
But, again, I will say, at least they
had the ability and the willingness to
come and testify, unlike the chairman,
who wrote a report, sent it to the Judi-
ciary Committee, and didn’t.
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes
to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.
GRANGER).
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in strong opposition to the
politically driven Articles of Impeach-
ment that have been brought before
the House of Representatives today.
For the past 3 years, Democrats have
been unable to accept the voters’
choice to elect President Trump. They
have used any and all undemocratic
and unfair means necessary to try and
remove him from office.
My vote today is not only against il-
legitimate impeachment of our Presi-
dent, which began not with facts but
with a foregone conclusion; it is
against House Democrats making a
mockery of due process and the rule of
law.
This will not go anywhere in the Sen-
ate, so all that Democrats have accom-
plished is postponing the important
work the American people sent their
elected officials to Washington to do.
This endless crusade of Democrats to
remove the duly elected President of
the United States has put partisan pol-
itics above the issues that Americans
face today. It is time Democrats stop
playing partisan games that hurt hard-
working taxpayers. It is time for the
American people to be Congress’ pri-
ority again.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in voting ‘‘no.’’
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I am more than de-
lighted to refer to the testimony of
Ambassador Volker and Mr. Morrison—
Ambassador Volker, who acknowledged
that, in retrospect, he should have rec-
ognized that when they were calling for
investigations of Burisma, it really
meant the Bidens, and that to ask a
foreign leader to investigate a political
rival was wrong.
I am happy to refer to his testimony
as well as Mr. Morrison, who went to
the National Security Council lawyer
immediately after he listened to that
telephone call and who also testified
that he was informed by Ambassador
Sondland that the President wanted
Zelensky ‘‘in a public box,’’ that he
wanted him to be forced to go to the
mike and announce these sham inves-
tigations.
I am happy to refer to their testi-
mony as well.
Madam Speaker, I am now happy to
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. SPEIER).
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, my fa-
ther fled Nazi Germany for America be-
cause he saw what happened when a
despot became untethered. He fled be-
cause he believed in democracy, the
rule of law, and the right to vote. Be-
fore he died, he asked to be buried in a
simple pine box with an American flag
to symbolize his love of this country.
Today, we are called upon to do our
duty out of love of country. The Presi-
dent stands accused. We must judge
him as we judge any of our fellow citi-
zens: on the facts and on the law.
The facts show that the President’s
North Star is Russia, not the Constitu-
tion.
There is no question that President
Trump delayed military aid to
Ukraine, our ally, as they were under
attack by Russia, our adversary.
There is no question the President
withheld a meeting with President
Zelensky at the White House, giving
Russia the upper hand in peace nego-
tiations with Ukraine.
There is no question that President
Trump promoted the Russian hoax that
Ukraine attacked our election in 2016,
a canard that has been proven to be a
lie, a Russian lie.
The only question is his motive. The
fact is, his conduct and crimes are rep-
rehensible and unquestionably im-
peachable.
When I vote today, my father’s leg-
acy is deep, very deep, within me. My
father loved America, and I love Amer-
ica. That is why I will vote to impeach
the President of the United States.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Madam Speaker, I see how this is
playing out. Instead of coming to tes-
tify for 7 or 8 hours and answering all
questions, we are going to do it in pot-
shots.
Again, let’s talk about Mr. Volker.
He never testified that anyone wanted
to investigate Vice President Biden.
What he did testify to, which was left
out, was that they wanted to, if the
Ukrainians are doing bad things, place
Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma
to avoid anything that needed to be in-
vestigated and found out.
Let’s at least tell the story. Again,
they had plenty of time to do this in an
actual hearing, not here. This is what
they want. This is what they have been
wanting. The majority has played this
the whole time. We will play this out
as long as they want to. It would have
been better, though, if they actually
had a case, to have made it in the prop-
er setting instead of not coming and
not testifying.
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.
WEBER).
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, it is very interesting to hear the so-
cialistic left Democrats that have a
newfound appreciation for the Con-
stitution and our Founders’ principles.
Would that those same socialists,
Madam Speaker, afford unborn babies
the right to life, liberty, and the pur-
suit of happiness, as well.
Madam Speaker, history tells us, in
the first three impeachments in this
country, crimes were involved. John-
son violated a law that Congress had
just passed, over his veto. Nixon was
involved in a coverup in Watergate.
Clinton lied to a Federal grand jury
and expected Monica Lewinsky to fal-
sify an affidavit. Crimes, all instances
of crimes.
Now come the socialistic-leaning D’s,
in my opinion, Madam Speaker, osten-
sibly reading the President’s mind,
knowing what his intent was, and dic-
tating to us and the witnesses that
were in the hearings what his mindset
was. Quite frankly, they didn’t believe
that he had the right to be in charge of
foreign policy.
We heard Ambassadors, and, yes, we
heard career bureaucrats, career dip-
lomats, whatever you want to call
them. They get to ride the bus; they
don’t get to drive the bus. The Presi-
dent is in charge of foreign policy.
They said that the President had the
audacity to use his judgment on for-
eign policy instead of theirs. Opinions.
Opinions. Suppositions, indeed. The
very swamp he is draining is objecting.
Who knew?
Today, now, during the earlier rule
debate, comes the floor manager of the
other side from Massachusetts citing
not facts, nor fact witnesses, but news-
paper articles from CNN and USA
Today, opinions and editorials.
Unbelievable, Madam Speaker. Amer-
icans are watching. The D’s are delu-
sional, deleterious, delirious, and in
deep yogurt.

December 18, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I
would just remind my colleagues that
Ambassador Volker said that the at-
tacks on Joe Biden were meritless, and
he tried to persuade Mr. Giuliani that
there was no factual support for them.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.
LEWIS).
Mr. LEWIS. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding. Madam
Speaker, I rise with a heavy heart to
support this resolution.
When we came to Washington in 1961
to go on the Freedom Rides, we chose
that day. When we came here on Au-
gust 28, 1963, for the March on Wash-
ington, it was joyful. We met with a
young President, President John Fitz-
gerald Kennedy.
When we came here on August 6, 1965,
for the signing of the Voting Rights
Act, we were excited and hopeful. We
met with President Lyndon Johnson.
But today, this day, we didn’t ask for
this. This is a sad day. It is not a day
of joy.
Our Nation is founded on the prin-
ciple that we do not have kings. We
have Presidents, and the Constitution
is our compass.
When you see something that is not
right, not just, not fair, you have a
moral obligation to say something, to
do something. Our children and their
children will ask us: What did you do?
What did you say?
For some, this vote may be hard. But
we have a mission and a mandate to be
on the right side of history.
b 1630
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I always like to be polite, and
I do appreciate the gentleman from
California confirming everything I just
said in my statement a moment ago.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.
WENSTRUP).
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker,
since 2016, America has seen a pattern
of failed and disproven attacks and al-
legations against President Trump.
Today is the fourth impeachment-re-
lated vote since President Trump took
office. It is yet another attempt to
reach their predetermined conclusion
of impeachment, a conclusion built on
political bias, accusations, and innu-
endo. These repetitive and false allega-
tions reveal a political obsession dis-
guised as some kind of righteous over-
sight.
When they didn’t win at the ballot
box, they pursued a Russian collusion
narrative that Special Counsel Robert
Mueller had to waste time and tax-
payer dollars to prove false.
When the Russian collusion mali-
cious deception didn’t work, Madam
Speaker, Democrats sought a new path
forward to impeach President Trump:
They created a made-for-TV set of
hearings complete with witness audi-
tions held in the basement of the Cap-
itol.
Despite all of their efforts, the
charges the House considers today lack
evidence to support them. There wasn’t
one witness who said a crime or im-
peachable offense was committed.
Madam Speaker, I remind my col-
leagues, no crime, no impeachable of-
fense. That is a pretty good defense if
you ask me.
I will work diligently to further re-
veal the truths and further reveal the
abuses of power, Madam Speaker, that
Democrats paid for and enacted during
the last 3 years, abuses of power from
the other side of the aisle within this
body and within our FBI. Americans
deserve the truth.
All in all, history will be remembered
today as the political impeachment
that set the precedent for Presidents to
be impeached every time there is a di-
vided government.
I oppose the articles before us today,
and I yield to the other side and their
superior imaginations.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. QUIGLEY).
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, in-
deed, we are here today because the
President of the United States abused
his power and betrayed his oath of of-
fice. He laid siege to the foundation of
our democracy: the electoral process.
These actions have posed a direct
threat to the freedom and fairness of
the upcoming 2020 election.
The very day after Robert Mueller
testified that Russia had systemati-
cally and relentlessly attacked the 2016
election, the President picked up the
phone and made his now infamous July
25 call to Ukrainian President
Zelensky, asking President Zelensky
on that call to ‘‘do us a favor though,’’
and announced investigations into his
political rival, Joe Biden.
We have since learned from numerous
National Security Council and State
Department officials that the Presi-
dent did not even expect Ukraine to
open these investigations; rather, he
just wanted them announced so he
could smear his rival. Rather than
trusting the voters to decide who
should hold the White House, he sought
the aid of a foreign country to tip the
scales in his favor—again.
After Russia’s unprecedented inter-
ference, a dark cloud hung over the
2016 election; and instead of leading the
American people out from under the
cloud, the President, instead,
emboldened by perceived lack of con-
sequence, attempted to pressure
Zelensky to interfere in the 2020 elec-
tion.
After a courageous whistleblower
came forward and warned Congress and
the public about the President’s
scheme, the President stood on the
White House lawn in front of TV cam-
eras broadcasting around the world and
called for China to interfere, too.
Some of my colleagues have asked:
Why not wait? Why are we proceeding?
That is very simple. Because nothing
could be more urgent. We are on the
precipice of the 2020 election, and Con-
gress has ultimate responsibility to
protect the sacred equalizer: our right
to vote.
To defend the integrity of our elec-
tions and to fulfill our duty to the Con-
stitution, I will be voting in favor of
impeachment today.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN).
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker,
anyone watching this impeachment
sound and fury, signifying nothing,
should look out for three misrepresen-
tations the Democrats are making:
One, Trump endangered national se-
curity.
No. The 55-day delay did not stop
Ukrainians from defending themselves.
Trump actually gave them lethal aid,
which Obama never did. During
Obama’s negligence, Democrats said
nothing.
Two, Trump is not above the law. No
one is.
But why don’t the Democrats tell us
what law he broke? They can’t, because
he didn’t break any. So Democrats
have resorted to two vague and subjec-
tive articles: abuse of power and ob-
struction of justice.
And, three, the evidence is not in dis-
pute.
No, the evidence is very much in dis-
pute. In fact, for every statement
Democrats cherry-pick to indict
Trump, more statements back up the
President.
In reality, this is nothing but a par-
tisan ploy by Democrats to overturn an
election. But this charade will fail, and
the Senate will exonerate Trump, and
everyone knows it.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. CASTRO).
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam
Speaker, as my colleagues have said,
the evidence of the President’s abuse of
power and obstruction of Congress is
uncontested. But let’s outline a few
key events involving the nearly $400
million in military aid that was held
up by President Trump and for Presi-
dent Trump despite congressional man-
date.
The summer of 2019 was a summer of
shame at the White House.
On July 3, the White House first
blocked security assistance money for
Ukraine with no explanation.
On July 10, Gordon Sondland states,
during a White House meeting with
Ukrainian officials, that they will get a
White House meeting only after an-
nouncing an investigation into Presi-
dent Trump’s political rival.
On July 18, a White House staffer an-
nounces the freeze on Ukrainian aid,
per direct Presidential order.
And just one day after Robert
Mueller’s testimony before Congress,
President Trump makes a now infa-
mous phone call with Zelensky asking
him to investigate the Bidens.
Then, things start to fall apart.
The White House learns that a whis-
tleblower has reported President
Trump’s phone call with President
Zelensky in a complaint.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H12168 December 18, 2019
On September 9, Congress starts to
investigate the President’s actions, and
then the jig is up.
On September 11, the aid is suddenly
released without explanation—over 2
months later.
When you read the call transcript
and follow the timeline I have laid out,
guilty is guilty. Nothing changed dur-
ing that time regarding the President’s
supposed concerns over corruption.
So let’s be clear. The military aid
was released because the President got
caught.
But getting caught doesn’t get you
off the hook.
And I ask my colleagues: Is at-
tempted murder a crime? Is attempted
robbery a crime? Is attempted extor-
tion and bribery by a President a
crime? Yes, it is.
The only question now is whether we
will find the moral courage to stand up
for our country and impeach the Presi-
dent of the United States.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Alabama (Mr. PALMER).
Mr. PALMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
in opposition to the impeachment of
President Trump.
Today is a day that diminishes the
reputation and stature of the United
States House of Representatives, a day
I never dreamed I would see.
Today, my Democratic colleagues
seek to overturn an election by forcing
a vote that will forever be a stain on
this Congress. They are not just voting
to impeach President Trump; my col-
leagues are voting to impeach the judg-
ment of every person who voted for
him and the process by which we elect
a President and by which we will gov-
ern our Nation.
My Democratic colleagues claim the
Russians influenced the outcome of the
2016 election, but based on their cor-
rupt impeachment proceedings, it ap-
pears my colleagues have been influ-
enced by how Russia conducts political
trials: no real evidence, no real crime,
no due process, and no justice.
The Democrats have failed to show
any legitimate justification for the im-
peachment of President Trump. When
they could not find real evidence, they
made it up and called it a parity.
They conducted most of the hearings
in secret.
They instructed witnesses not to an-
swer Republican Members’ questions,
and they denied Republicans the right
to call witnesses, making it absolutely
clear their objective was, from the be-
ginning, pathetically political.
We all understand that elections
have consequences.
To all of my colleagues, Democrats
and Republicans alike, this day will
surely have consequences, as well, as
we descend into more disrespect, dis-
trust, and even contempt that will
eventually be destructive of this Cham-
ber and, I fear, eventually, our Repub-
lic.
I urge all Members to vote ‘‘no’’ on
impeachment.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, very
quickly, my colleagues have made re-
peated reference to some secret pro-
ceedings in some secret star chamber.
This is apparently what they call depo-
sitions.
I remind my colleagues that, when
they were in the majority, they con-
ducted depositions, but they were dif-
ferent in this respect:
In the depositions we conducted in
the Intelligence Committee, over 100
Members were able to participate. That
is how secret they were. We revealed
all of the transcripts of those deposi-
tions.
The repetition of this falsehood does
not make it true; it only makes the
falsehood that much more deliberate.
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman
from Michigan (Mr. AMASH).
Mr. AMASH. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in support of these Articles of
Impeachment. I come to this floor not
as a Democrat, not as a Republican,
but as an American who cares deeply
about the Constitution, the rule of law,
and the rights of the people.
Under our system of government, im-
peachment is not about policy dis-
agreements or ineffective governance,
nor is it about criminality based on
statutes that did not exist at the time
our Constitution was written. Impeach-
ment is about maintaining the integ-
rity of the Office of the Presidency and
ensuring that Executive power is di-
rected toward proper ends in accord-
ance with the law.
The Constitution grants the House
‘‘the sole power of impeachment’’ and
the Senate ‘‘the sole power to try all
impeachments.’’
We in the House are empowered to
charge impeachable conduct. The Con-
stitution describes such conduct as
‘‘high crimes and misdemeanors,’’ but
because it pertains to high office and
relates to the misuse of that office, we
need not rely on any other branch or
body to endorse our determinations.
We have ‘‘the sole power of impeach-
ment.’’
In Federalist No. 65, Alexander Ham-
ilton wrote that high crimes and mis-
demeanors ‘‘are those offenses which
proceed from the misconduct of public
men, or, in other words, from the abuse
or violation of some public trust. They
are of a nature which may with pecu-
liar propriety be denominated polit-
ical, as they relate chiefly to injuries
done immediately to the society
itself.’’
President Donald J. Trump has
abused and violated the public trust by
using his high office to solicit the aid
of a foreign power, not for the benefit
of the United States of America, but,
instead, for his personal and political
gain. His actions reflect precisely the
type of conduct the Framers of the
Constitution intended to remedy
through the power of impeachment,
and it is our duty to impeach him.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, undoubtedly, H. Res. 660 does
not matter to the majority, in par-
ticular, the manager of this bill, be-
cause the inspector general, his tran-
script has not been released. There
have not been documents that were
transferred that were supposed to be
transferred to the White House, and we
are still not sure we got everything we
are supposed to get in the Judiciary
Committee.
I guess when you want to be trans-
parent and open, you hold it in a SCIF
and do whatever you want.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from Florida (Mr.
STEUBE).
Mr. STEUBE. Madam Speaker, this
impeachment charade did not start
with the whistleblower complaint. The
campaign to impeach a duly elected
President and overturn the will of 63
million Americans started 19 minutes
after the President took the oath of of-
fice.
Nineteen minutes after the inaugura-
tion, The Washington Post published a
story, headline, ‘‘The Campaign to Im-
peach President Trump Has Begun.’’
The first day of this Congress, on day
one, a Democratic member of my class
called for the impeachment of the
President long before the call to
Ukraine. Then it was the Russia collu-
sion hoax, then obstruction of justice,
then bribery, then quid pro quo—none
of which are included in these articles
before us today.
The first Article of Impeachment
crafted as a fiction is not an enumer-
ated basis in the Constitution for im-
peachment. The Democratic majority
would have you believe that abuse of
power is a high crime or misdemeanor.
It is not. It is an opinion. It is not even
a crime that can be charged in a court
of law.
Unlike Presidents Nixon and Clinton
who were tried for actual crimes, this
President is being impeached on vague
phrases that appear nowhere in our
Constitution.
The second article, obstruction of
Congress, again, doesn’t exist in the
Constitution as a basis for impeach-
ment and is attempting to impeach a
duly elected President for asserting
constitutionally based privileges that
have been asserted on a bipartisan
basis by administrations of both polit-
ical parties throughout our Nation’s
history.
This House is impeaching a President
over a phone call to another world
leader, a few lines in a phone transcript
that have been completely and utterly
misrepresented by the majority. The
process that ensued was anything but
open, transparent, bipartisan, or equi-
table.
Abandoning all past historical due
process afforded the minority and the
President, the Democrats ran a par-
tisan investigation, refusing rights of
the minority, refusing the ability of
the President’s counsel to call wit-
nesses, refusing to allow the Presi-
dent’s counsel to cross-examine fact
witnesses, and refusing a minority
hearing day, just to name a few.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H12169
December 18, 2019
The majority waves around a report
drafted that the Democratic staff con-
cocted as a matter of fact. When they
needed backup for their approach, they
paraded out liberal professors with ani-
mus against the President who gave
them license to impeach the President
for any reason they wish.
House Democrats are making them-
selves kings in a manner far worse and
more obvious than what they are ac-
cusing the President of doing. The only
abuse of power here is by the Demo-
cratic-led Congress.
b 1645
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CISNEROS).
Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker,
when I was 18 years old, I joined the
United States Navy and took the oath
to support and defend the Constitution
for the first time. I took that oath
again earlier this year as a Member of
Congress; and every day I work hard to
live by that oath and give the 39th Dis-
trict the representation it deserves.
I have always maintained that im-
peachment is a serious undertaking
and must be done with incredible care.
When the unprecedented allegations
against the President and his inter-
actions with Ukraine were first re-
ported, I felt that it was Congress’ duty
to investigate and find out the truth.
Now the facts are before Congress
and the American people. The Presi-
dent betrayed his oath to support and
defend the Constitution by attempting
to undermine the integrity of our elec-
tion for his own personal benefit. He
asked a foreign government to inves-
tigate a political rival and endangered
our national security by withholding
military aid to an ally.
For me, it is not about personal poli-
tics or party affiliation. It is about up-
holding my oath to put our country
and our Constitution first and protect
our national security. This is why I
will vote to move forward with the im-
peachment of the President. I hope all
my colleagues will join me in recog-
nizing this grave threat and stand up
to this administration in defense of our
country and our Constitution.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF).
Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Madam
Speaker, going back almost 3 years to
when the President was sworn into of-
fice, we have seen some Members on
the other side of the aisle pledging and
promising to impeach President
Trump. Prior to the start of this in-
quiry, Speaker PELOSI claimed that the
impeachment must be compelling,
overwhelming, and bipartisan. The im-
peachment inquiry was announced less
than 3 months ago, and what we know
is that the process has been fast,
faulty, and flawed.
What we have witnessed since Sep-
tember 24, when the inquiry was an-
nounced, is that the evidence we have
seen is not compelling, it is not over-
whelming, and the process is undoubt-
edly and unquestionably not bipar-
tisan.
I am viewing this through the lens of
a former United States Attorney, and
as we take this vote, here is the bot-
tom line for the American people:
there was no bribery, there was no ex-
tortion, there was no quid pro quo, and
there were no high crimes and mis-
demeanors committed by the Presi-
dent.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. JUDY CHU).
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam
Speaker, we know that President
Trump withheld needed military aid to
Ukraine. We know that he used it to
demand Ukraine interfere in the 2020
election for his own benefit, and we
know that Ukraine knew. None of
these facts have been disputed. Instead,
the White House has tried to hide the
truth. But the President is not above
the law. Nobody is.
Corruption and obstruction; the
President is guilty of both. The blatant
abuse of power was made clear from
over 100 hours of testimony before
three committees and was clear in the
call summary released by the White
House. The obstruction has been made
clear by the President’s refusal to co-
operate at every turn, even when or-
dered by a court.
Setting a precedent that any Presi-
dent can abuse their power to interfere
in our elections is an existential threat
to our democracy. It is also a betrayal
of the oath of office and the Constitu-
tion.
Therefore, in fulfillment of my own
oath of office, it is with solemn purpose
today that I vote to impeach President
Donald Trump.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. GIBBS).
Mr. GIBBS. Madam Speaker, Demo-
crats started with quid pro quo. That
didn’t work so well. Then it was brib-
ery and extortion. Then they brought
the witnesses in, and not one could an-
swer if they saw any evidence of brib-
ery, extortion, or any crime when ques-
tioned. It was just silence. Then the
witnesses testified they heard this
from so-and-so. When the Democrats
brought their star witness in, Ambas-
sador Sondland, when asked, he said: I
presumed the aid was held up.
I presumed?
Testimony was all hearsay, conjec-
ture, and assumptions. So now it is
abuse of power with no underlying
crime, which is opinion. Abuse of power
to the Democrats is they don’t like his
policies, or he treated a reporter harsh-
ly.
Obstruction of Congress: there are
three coequal branches of government.
When the executive branch and the leg-
islative branch have an impasse, that
is when the judicial branch intervenes.
They didn’t do that. The Democrats
didn’t take that route.
Every President, including George
Washington, could have been im-
peached based on these factless arti-
cles. There is no crime, and there is no
victim as Ukraine received their aid
before the December 30 deadline and no
witnesses who witnessed anything.
This isn’t about the rule of law. It is
politics at its worst. It is disgraceful.
It is time to end the charade and scam
on the American people.
Madam Speaker, I urge everybody to
vote ‘‘no’’ on these Articles of Im-
peachment.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I am
happy to remind my colleagues of Am-
bassador Sondland’s testimony.
He posed the question: Was there a
quid pro quo?
The answer is yes.
When he was asked about a quid pro
quo involving the military aid, he said
it was as clear as two plus two equals
four.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.
SCHAKOWSKY).
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
my adult son, Ian Schakowsky, I will
always credit for my decision last June
to support the impeachment inquiry. It
had never been my goal to impeach a
President, but Ian made such a compel-
ling case. He reminded me of the oath
I have taken 11 times now to support
and defend the Constitution of the
United States. He said: Mom, this is
not about politics, and this is not
about party.
Pushing back against my arguments,
he said: This has nothing to do with
the final outcome. It is about doing the
right thing, even if others don’t.
He made me see that it was about my
legacy, my modest place in history.
I want to thank my son for helping
me do the right thing today to vote to
impeach the President of the United
States, Donald Trump, because no
American is above the law.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I also would like to remind
the gentleman from California that Mr.
Sondland also said he had no direct evi-
dence; he presumed that that was going
on.
I guess we are back to presumption
again.
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FLO-
RES).
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, on
March 11 of this year, the Speaker of
the House said the following in an
interview with The Washington Post:
‘‘Impeachment is so divisive to the
country that unless there’s something
so compelling and overwhelming and
bipartisan, I don’t think we should go
down that path, because it divides the
country.’’
I think most Americans would agree
with that statement because it sounds
thoughtful and reasonable.
So here we are today to vote on the
Articles of Impeachment.
How did the majority party do in
meeting the objectives set forth by the
Speaker?
Here are the answers: First, the only
compelling attribute about this sham

is the lengths the majority has gone to
appease the radical, Socialist wing of
their party.
Second, the only overwhelming fea-
ture about this sham is the abuse of
power by the majority and the reckless
disregard for fairness by the majority
throughout this entire circus.
Finally, the only bipartisan activity
related to this sham will be the votes
against these flimsy Articles of Im-
peachment.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues
to join me in opposing these deplorable
Articles of Impeachment and to de-
mand that the House get back to work-
ing on the priorities that hardworking
American families care about the
most.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. RUPPERSBERGER).
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Madam
Speaker, I spent 12 years on the House
Permanent Select Committee on Intel-
ligence, including 4 as ranking mem-
ber. My bipartisan cooperation with
the Republican chairman was widely
recognized. When it comes to national
security, there is no room for bipar-
tisan politics.
All 17 witnesses—mostly Trump ap-
pointees—told the same story during
the Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence hearings, each testifying
that our Commander in Chief jeopard-
ized American national security for the
sake of his reelection. The President
held hostage military aid for the fight
against a common enemy, Russia.
He willfully obstructed Congress’
constitutionally prescribed impeach-
ment powers.
Over the last 2 years, I resisted calls
to begin impeachment proceedings, and
I resent those who say this is about re-
versing the election. This isn’t about
whether or not you like Trump. It is
about upholding our Constitution.
Allowing this conduct to go unques-
tioned sets a dangerous precedent and
permanently damages our system of
checks and balances. No one is above
the law. President Trump’s actions are
a clear threat to our national security
and democracy. We must uphold our
oath of office and support these arti-
cles.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG).
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in strong opposition to these
baseless Articles of Impeachment.
Our Founding Fathers never intended
impeachment to be a one-sided polit-
ical weapon. Sadly, the majority has
reduced this serious constitutional ac-
tion to a purely partisan tactic to take
down President Trump.
History will not be kind to the vote
today. It will be remembered as a
rushed process that lacks credibility or
transparency with a predetermined
outcome that puts a premium on polit-
ical theater instead of facts. By any ob-
jective standard, the Democrats’ im-
peachment case is the thinnest imag-
inable. There is no impeachable offense
before us today. It is a complete and
total sham.
I close, not by quoting a President
from the past, but rather from the duly
elected President Donald Trump: ‘‘You
are the ones interfering in America’s
election. You are the ones subverting
America’s democracy. You are the ones
obstructing justice. You are the ones
bringing pain and suffering to our Re-
public for your own selfish personal,
political, and partisan gain.’’ These are
hard words I know, but that is the sad
reality of this entire process.
I will proudly vote ‘‘no’’ today, a
vote that upholds our Constitution, de-
fends our President, and preserves the
pillars of our Nation’s democracy.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. GRIJALVA).
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I
will vote in favor of impeachment
today. The facts are irrefutable, and
the ongoing obstruction and coverup is
shameful.
My parents came here as immigrants,
and I am proud to live in a nation that
rewarded their hard work by providing
a better future for my sisters and me.
As a first generation American and
now a Member of Congress, a story like
mine is only made possible by a nation
that upholds the rule of law and truly
lives out the values enshrined in our
Constitution.
Mona and I are blessed with three
wonderful daughters and five
grandkids. Because of this living leg-
acy and the legacy I intend to pass on
to my grandchildren, my vote today is
rooted in protecting their future.
The underpinnings for impeachment
are real and historic. Trump has per-
verted the rule of law, abused his
power, and engaged in a coverup. No
amount of misdirection, lies,
disinformation, tantrums, and cries of
victimization by Trump and others can
undo the abuse of power and obstruc-
tion of Congress that remain clear and
present. The President leaves us no
choice but to vote to impeach, so that
we can protect our democracy and cor-
rect the damage that is already done.
I will vote in favor of the impeach-
ment of Donald J. Trump, not as a par-
tisan act but as a serious, urgent, and
necessary one.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY).
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, 21
years ago this week, I spoke here on
impeachment. Sadly, history will not
treat Democrats well. They will forever
be remembered as the Senator Joe
McCarthys of our time, so blinded by
their hatred of President Trump that
they abandoned American rights of due
process, fairness, and just decency.
Reminiscent of Joe McCarthy, they
assaulted the Constitution, took glee
in secret hearings, blocked evidence,
and switched charges like rogue pros-
ecutors. Ultimately, they chose abuse
of power because they practice it so
well.
President Trump committed no
crime or impeachable offense—none.
His legacy won’t be stained; Demo-
crats’ will. We will look back at these
days in shame because Trump haters in
Congress, like red haters of the past,
are willing to plunge America into
darkness for raw political gain.
This impeachment betrays the Na-
tion, the Constitution, and the Amer-
ican people. I vote ‘‘no.’’
b 1700
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. DOGGETT).
Mr. DOGGETT. Tyranny rarely ap-
pears full borne. It arises, it encroaches
as freedom ebbs. Our Nation’s great
Founders sought to protect us from
tyranny with a carefully crafted sys-
tem of checks and balances.
But now along comes a President
who actually says he is constitu-
tionally empowered to do whatever he
wants, that he can neither be pros-
ecuted nor even investigated for any
crime, and that he can totally ignore
any impeachment proceeding of which
he disapproves.
These are the claims of a wannabe
tyrant who has extolled the virtues of
tyrants and autocrats from Manila to
Moscow.
To advance tyranny, he adopts an
open-border policy inviting foreigners
to come into our country and intrude
in our elections. Foreign nations have
their own agendas, especially adver-
saries like Russia and China.
American citizens should be the only
ones determining the fate of America.
If the President continues demanding
more foreign interference, we will
never have truly free elections, and we
will not be free.
We act today, recognizing the solemn
responsibility to safeguard our security
and Constitution. We pledge allegiance
to the flag and the Republic for which
it stands, not to one man who would be
king.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, before I call my next speaker,
may I ask the time remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 1 hour and 31⁄4
minutes remaining. The gentleman
from California has 571⁄4 minutes re-
maining.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN).
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank
my friend from Georgia for his great
work in dealing with this very sad day
in our country.
Madam Speaker, today, for the third
time in our Nation’s history, a Presi-
dent will be impeached. This will be,
however, the first time impeachment
has been entirely partisan and without
merit. This charade is not because
President Trump is guilty of a high
crime or misdemeanor but because one
political party doesn’t like him or his
policies of America First.
Fact one: We have a divided govern-
ment, and House Democrats are at war
with the executive branch.

Fact two: They have been planning
for this day since President Trump
took office.
Fact three: They accused the Presi-
dent first and have spent months look-
ing for a crime.
Fact four: No evidence has been pre-
sented of an impeachable offense.
During one of the partisan hearings,
a Member of this body asked: If Presi-
dent Trump had evidence of his inno-
cence, why didn’t he bring it forward?
The Democrats want Americans to
believe that our President is guilty
until he proves himself innocent. This
whole process is unconstitutional.
Today, we have heard both sides, but
we need to get the truth. The truth is,
the decision of who should be our
President should be made by the Amer-
ican people, not Speaker PELOSI, ADAM
SCHIFF, and House Democrats.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
3 minutes to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. ENGEL).
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I thank
my friend.
As chairman of the Foreign Affairs
Committee, I have to say that this is a
sad day. No one is gleeful that the
President’s actions have brought us to
this point.
But when you boil it down, we are
here today because the President
abused the power of his office to help
his chances at reelection. He used the
enormous weight of the Presidency and
American foreign policy to push a for-
eign government to smear a political
rival. And he got caught.
Why is this conduct so serious? Why
has the President’s behavior pushed
the House of Representatives to exer-
cise one of its most consequential con-
stitutional responsibilities? Because
corrupting an American election, par-
ticularly in cahoots with a foreign
power, means corrupting American de-
mocracy.
Our elections are at the heart of our
democracy, the foundation of what
makes our system of government
great, our Republic, if we can keep it,
as Benjamin Franklin once said.
If our elections aren’t fair, then our
Republic cannot stand. Anyone who
tries to fix an election is taking away
the power of the American people to
choose their leaders. If it happens at
any level of government, it is toxic to
our democracy, and this came from the
highest level.
In this case, it is even more serious,
because what was the President willing
to give up for this advantage? What
price was he willing to pay? The price
was our national security.
When the President devised a shadow
foreign policy that undermined our di-
plomacy and diplomats; when he held
back assistance for Ukraine, which was
embroiled in a war against Russia;
when he pressured a foreign govern-
ment to interfere in our elections,
again, he sacrificed our security. He
shook the faith of a loyal ally. He
played right into the hands of Vladimir
Putin. He weakened our country all be-
cause he thought it might help his re-
election bid.
Only the President has that power to
corrupt our foreign policy for political
gain. The moment he chose to do so,
the moment he undermined our secu-
rity in this scheme to undermine our
democracy, whether he succeeded or
not—and thank God, he did not—at
that moment, it became an abuse of
power.
A President who abuses his power for
personal gain is exactly what the
Framers feared. It is why impeachment
is in the Constitution.
We need to pass these articles. The
President’s actions have left us no
choice. He cannot be allowed to under-
mine our democracy and tear apart the
fabric that holds our country together.
Madam Speaker, I will vote for im-
peachment.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. GAETZ), who
is a member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee.
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, this is
not about Ukraine. It is about power.
Donald Trump has it, and House Demo-
crats want it.
With no crime, no victim, no evi-
dence, no proof, no agenda for America,
this impeachment charade marches on,
following no rules and adhering to no
sense of honor.
The American people aren’t fooled by
dirty tricks. Voters will never forget
that Democrats have been triggered
into impeaching the President because
they don’t like him and they don’t like
us.
Those who vote ‘‘yes’’ on today’s Ar-
ticles of Impeachment must carry the
heavy burden of shame and guilt for as
long as they serve in Congress, which
won’t be long because the American
people will remember in November.
Democrats would rather trip the
President just to see him stumble than
see America succeed. They would rath-
er impeach the President than work to-
gether for the common good of our
country and our citizens.
Democrats may have won the House
in 2018, but they haven’t forgiven Don-
ald Trump for having the audacity to
win the Presidency.
And they haven’t forgiven you, the
American people, for voting for him.
The day before she was sworn in to
Congress, one Member of the body said
she promised to impeach the
mothereffer.
She is not alone. Trump’s impeach-
ment was plotted and planned before
the ink was even dry on his election
certificate and, possibly, before some
Democrats could even point to Ukraine
on a map.
In seeking the chairmanship of the
Committee on the Judiciary, the gen-
tleman from New York said that he
was the strongest Member to lead a po-
tential impeachment.
Democrats may not have known why
they were going to impeach the Presi-
dent, but they knew it was an inevi-
tability, facts be damned.
This impeachment is a slap in the
face to the millions of Americans who
voted for President Trump. The same
Americans who Democrats in Wash-
ington have mocked as smelly Walmart
shoppers and ‘‘deplorables.’’
Madam Speaker, this impeachment
isn’t legitimate. It is the radical left’s
insurance policy. But we have an insur-
ance policy, too. It is the next election,
and we intend to win it.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from
Vermont (Mr. WELCH).
Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, we, the
people, have a common tie that binds
us together now as it has since the
founding of our country, and it is our
shared respect for the Constitution of
the United States.
Let us all step back from the mael-
strom of the moment to recall that, at
our country’s inception 243 years ago,
the concept of a democratic, self-gov-
erning rule was a breathtaking and
idealistic aspiration. When the 13
American Colonies boldly rejected the
rule of the British monarch, our
Founders were determined to form a
government that would rule instead
with the consent of the governed.
Ensuring that this noble experiment
endured through the ages was an enor-
mous existential challenge. It was met
with the adoption of the Constitution
in 1788.
At its heart are two bedrock prin-
ciples that have served as touchstones
for our country ever since. First, it es-
tablished America as a nation of laws,
where no person is above the law. Sec-
ond, it established the concept of a sep-
aration of powers where three coequal
branches of government would check
each other, lest power be concentrated
in one at the expense of liberty to all.
Madam Speaker, when President
Trump abused the power of his office
by soliciting foreign interference in the
upcoming election for his personal ben-
efit, he willfully infringed upon the
right of citizens to decide who will lead
our Nation. In doing so, he placed him-
self above the law and in violation of
his oath.
When he denounced, denied, and de-
fied the clear authority of Congress to
investigate his conduct, he repudiated
our constitutional system of checks
and balances and further violated his
oath to preserve, protect, and defend
the Constitution.
It is for these reasons that I will cast
my vote in favor of impeaching Presi-
dent Donald John Trump.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS).
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, some of
my colleagues across the aisle have
said, ‘‘Hey, where are the facts?’’ as if
we have the burden of proof.
Madam Speaker, it is their burden of
proof. It is the Democrats’ burden of
proof.
But the facts are unchanged. Ukraine
received aid that they were promised
and appropriated for. The aid was law-
fully disbursed. In fact, it was dis-
bursed within the time limits set by

this Congress. If you wanted it sent to
them before September 30, 2019, you
should have put that in the legislation.
You did not.
The Ukrainians gave nothing in re-
turn. The Ukrainian President said he
felt no pressure, no coercion, no duress,
no conditionality.
What changed? On the day that the
aid was released, two anticorruption
measures were signed into law by the
Ukrainian President, President
Zelensky.
Democrats have manufactured this
sham and then argue that refusing to
cooperate is impeachable. The Supreme
Court is currently considering the ex-
tent of executive privilege when fight-
ing dubious subpoenas. But instead of
taking their process to court or wait-
ing for the Court to rule on the pending
case, the Democrats chose to press for-
ward because, simply, they said: ‘‘We
don’t want to wait.’’
‘‘We don’t have time,’’ they say. But
failing to do so is an abuse of power of
this institution that will have grave
consequences for our Republic.
When the other side claims they pro-
ceed with soberness, I am bemused by
media reports that indicate they have
been admonished not to do a jig today
when they win the vote, which we
know they will. I am struck that so-
lemnity of process shouldn’t need to
have an admonition against levity.
This process has been partisan, vin-
dictive, dishonest. In this impeach-
ment, Democrats have lied about the
content of the July 25 call; met se-
cretly with the whistleblower; held So-
viet-style hearings behind closed doors
where the Committee on the Judiciary,
the committee of jurisdiction, could
not attend; and blocked the President’s
counsel from participating in the fact-
finding portion of the inquisition.
Madam Speaker, it has been a sham
from start to finish.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.
SCOTT) for a unanimous consent re-
quest.
(Mr. SCOTT of Virginia asked and
was given permission to revise and ex-
tend his remarks.)
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam
Speaker, I include my remarks in favor
of both Articles of Impeachment.
Every Member of Congress swore an oath
to uphold and defend the Constitution, and
that oath should be the guide for all of us
when considering articles of impeachment
against the President of the United States.
There has been considerable public debate
over what constitutes impeachable offenses;
the Constitution names them as ‘Treason,
Bribery, or other high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors.’ Under normal circumstances, the
country could wait until the next election to re-
move an undesirable president from office.
Issues like the President’s Muslim ban, sepa-
rating babies from their parents at the border,
trying to undermine access to health care, cut-
ting funding for education, standing in the way
of commonsense gun legislation, or other
harmful policy stances are not impeachable of-
fenses, but issues that will be addressed in
the 2020 election. However, our founders in-
cluded impeachment in the Constitution for
times when an official’s conduct was so egre-
gious, we could not wait for the next election
to remove that individual from office. President
Trump’s Ukraine scheme was intended to in-
fluence the 2020 election to make it an unfair
process, and that highlights a key reason why
he must be impeached and removed from of-
fice.
Multiple House Committees have conducted
extensive investigations into the President’s
conduct. The facts are uncontested. President
Trump invited Ukraine to interfere in our next
presidential election and leveraged des-
perately needed military aid and a high-profile
visit to the White House to promote his
scheme. This constitutes an attack on our
electoral system and democracy itself and is a
gross abuse of presidential power. This
scheme needs to be viewed in the context of
other actions by this President. The Mueller
report found multiple instances of obstruction
of justice committed by the President, and that
obstruction has continued. Furthermore, the
President has continued to violate the Emolu-
ments Clause by profiting from foreign and do-
mestic business transactions from the moment
he took office, and that violation has contin-
ued.
With the Ukraine scheme, the President has
admitted in public to actions that sacrifice na-
tional security for his own personal, political
gain and then he insisted that he did nothing
wrong. His ongoing attack of the whistleblower
serves to discourage other whistleblowers
from coming forward, his intimidation of wit-
nesses during impeachment proceedings, his
orders to witnesses to ignore subpoenas, and
his invitation to China to meddle in our next
election all indicate that, left unchecked, this
President will not cease his misconduct and
will seek to do it again. The President con-
tinues to put his own personal and political
gain above the law and his conduct in these
matters constitutes clear abuses of power and
an ongoing threat to our democracy.
If the President had simple acknowledged
the basic fact that trying to sabotage the next
presidential election is wrong, and that he
would not continue such behavior, we could
be discussing the question of waiting until the
next election to express our views on his con-
duct. We would have to discuss the credibility
of such a statement, but a discussion over
waiting for the election would be a relevant
issue. However, that is not the case. President
Trump continues to obstruct properly con-
vened investigations and he continues to
abuse his power by trying to undermine the
next presidential election.
For all of these reasons, I will vote for both
articles of impeachment.
I came to the 116th Congress to serve the
people of Virginia’s Third Congressional Dis-
trict, and to focus on my work as chair of the
Committee on Education and Labor. Com-
mittee Democrats have been working to ex-
pand access to the building blocks of a strong
middle class—a quality education, a rewarding
job, and affordable health care. The House
has already passed the Raise the Wage Act,
the Lower Drug Costs Now Act, the Paycheck
Fairness Act, the Stronger Child Abuse Pre-
vention and Treatment Act, the Butch Lewis
Act, the Dignity in Aging Act, and the Work-
place Violence Prevention for Health Care and
Social Service Workers Act. The Committee
has also approved the College Affordability
Act, the Rebuild America’s Schools Act, the
Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act,
and other critical legislation awaiting a vote by
the full House. Later this week, the House will
ratify the USMCA with strong labor protec-
tions.
However, if we expect our democracy to
survive, President Trump’s abuse of power
cannot be ignored. No one is above the law.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Indi-
ana (Mr. CARSON).
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam
Speaker, as we continue and consider
this historic impeachment vote, let’s
be clear that the President’s actions
seriously jeopardize not only America’s
national security but the security of
our closest allies. His actions threaten
the goals of the U.S.-led NATO alli-
ance.
You see, Ukraine is a nation working
hard to make its democracy stronger.
Make no mistake, Ukraine is on the
front lines of Russian aggression.
Thankfully, U.S. military aid helps
Ukraine defend itself against Russia
and integrate itself into the European
community.
When our European allies are strong-
er, America is stronger. We are better
equipped to promote democracy and
put a stop to tyranny.
But, Madam Speaker, to President
Trump, strengthening this valuable na-
tional security objective was not as im-
portant as smearing a political rival.
Madam Speaker, we know that he
held nearly $400 million of aid to
Ukraine until President Zelensky
agreed to help him dig up dirt on his
potential 2020 opponent.
b 1715
This aid was approved by Congress
with strong bipartisan support.
President Trump’s actions hurt
American diplomacy and undermine
the integrity of our Nation’s promises
to our allies. We will not allow our
leaders to trade away our national se-
curity.
We cannot allow Russia’s continued
threats to democracy to go unan-
swered, and we must not allow our own
President of these United States to get
away with breaking his own oath of of-
fice.
Madam Speaker, that is why we take
this solemn but necessary vote to im-
peach.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. LATTA).
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, this is
a sad day for our country, one that our
forefathers warned us against.
We have watched this illegitimate
impeachment process unfold while
making a mockery of our constitu-
tional duties. House Democrats have
conducted the most polarizing im-
peachment process in our Nation’s his-
tory, and the men and women I rep-
resent are tired of this Democrat-run
House putting political games above
our Nation’s interests.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H12173
December 18, 2019
House Democrats held secret meet-
ings, withheld important documents,
deliberately misrepresented informa-
tion to the public, and did not give due
process to the President. This inves-
tigation was unfair, and the American
people expect more out of Congress.
The Articles of Impeachment are not
based on facts but, instead, are entirely
politically motivated. The truth is
there was no pressure put on President
Zelensky, and the transcripts confirm
that there was no conditionality.
This inquiry has been rigged from the
start, lacking fairness, transparency,
and truth. It has been a waste of tax-
payers’ dollars, and it is based off the
opinion of an unnamed whistleblower
and hearsay. The accusations in to-
day’s proceedings do not align with the
facts.
This impeachment process is out of
step with existing precedent for Presi-
dential impeachment proceedings, and
it is not a process I will support. I urge
my colleagues to put country first and
vote in opposition to the Articles of
Impeachment.
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentlewoman from New
York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY).
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the impeachment of President
Donald J. Trump.
President Trump abused the power of
his office for his own personal and po-
litical gain at the expense of our na-
tional security.
President Trump’s wholesale obstruc-
tion of Congress is unprecedented, in-
disputable, and impeachable. President
Trump is the first President in history
to openly and completely defy all as-
pects of the constitutional impeach-
ment process.
In an attempt to cover up his abuse
of power, he ordered the entire execu-
tive branch not to participate in the
inquiry and directed it to defy lawful
subpoenas from Congress.
As chairwoman of the Committee on
Oversight and Reform, I find this ob-
struction particularly offensive.
Even President Nixon accepted Con-
gress’ impeachment authority and al-
lowed his aides and advisers to produce
the documents to Congress. And Presi-
dent Nixon allowed current and former
staff to testify in both the House im-
peachment and the Senate Watergate
investigations, including his chief of
staff and White House counsel.
By contrast, President Trump, with-
out any legal basis, directed current
and former officials not to cooperate
with the House’s inquiry, which re-
sulted in nine administration officials
defying subpoenas for testimony. And
in response to the House’s inquiry,
President Trump refused to turn over
even one single—not one single—docu-
ment to Congress in response to lawful
subpoenas.
Put simply, President Trump’s ac-
tions are even worse than Nixon’s.
Let me repeat that. President
Trump’s actions are even worse than
Nixon’s.
Our Founding Fathers established a
system of checks and balances that
spread out power between the branches
of government. They decided that no
one would be a king, that no one is
above the law, including the President.
And they gave the responsibility of im-
peachment solely to the people’s
House.
When President Trump defies our
subpoenas and obstructs our impeach-
ment inquiry, he seeks to place himself
above the Constitution and above the
law.
We cannot let that stand; and if we
do, then that is the end of Congress as
a coequal branch of government, and
we have allowed President Trump to
elevate himself above the law.
It is our solemn duty, under the Con-
stitution, to impeach President Trump
for his blatant abuse of power and his
obstruction of Congress.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from Arkansas (Mr. WOMACK).
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for giving me this mo-
ment.
Mr. Speaker, years from now, history
books will tell of this day. It will tell
of a purely partisan effort to remove
the President of the United States, an
effort not built on a high crime or mis-
demeanor, not on a process in keeping
with the high American standard of
due process and equal treatment. This
effort is rooted only in the governing
party’s hatred of a man elected Presi-
dent of the United States.
Members on the other side of the
aisle have been in pursuit of this mo-
ment since 2016. They are consumed by
it. Earlier in this debate, one of our
colleagues referred to our President as
a ‘‘domestic enemy.’’
Our Founders warned us about this
day. That is why our Nation has en-
trusted the future of the country with
the outcome of elections, not the will
of a party filled with contempt for a
duly elected President.
My hope is that, when historians
write about this day, it is not written
in the context of a nation that lost its
way because its elected Members chose
hateful partisanship over the sacred
oath that has protected this great Re-
public since its founding.
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from New
Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI).
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, in
America, when we call the fire depart-
ment or enroll our children in school,
we do not expect a government official
to say to us: ‘‘I need you to do us a
favor, though.’’ Why would we tolerate
a President using his awesome power
to make foreign policy, when the safe-
ty of our country is at stake, not for
the people, but for himself?
I will vote to impeach today because
President Trump did just that when he
shook down a foreign country to crimi-
nally investigate his political rival.
If we fail to say that this was wrong,
then any President will be free to ask
a foreign power—be it Russia, China, or
Iran—to help him hurt his political en-
emies at home, and every foreign ty-
rant and kleptocrat will know that
America’s foreign policy can be bought
by doing our President a political
favor.
If you believe that our highest duty
is to protect America, then search your
conscience and ask: Do you want our
future Presidents to behave as this one
has done?
Do not whisper in the shadows of the
Capitol that you disapprove and then
defend that conduct here today. Do
your duty. Keep your oath. Defend
your country, as will I.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON).
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, over a month ago, on Novem-
ber 14, I spoke on the impeachment
hoax with points true then and still
true today.
After over a month of secret inves-
tigations into the administration,
Democrats have now decided to open
these controlled hearings to the public.
This continues the deception by Demo-
crats to mislead the American people.
It is insulting: no Republican wit-
nesses, no counsel by the President to
participate, and full exoneration by
courageous President Volodymyr
Zelensky of Ukraine.
It is sad that, instead of focusing on
funding our military through the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act
passed only last week or passing the
United States-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment to create jobs, Democrats con-
tinue, having wasted $30 million of tax-
payers’ money on the Russian hoax,
now proceeding with a Ukrainian hoax.
This partisan witch hunt diverts at-
tention from the President’s successes:
The unemployment rate remains at a
record low; there is record job creation;
and the stock market, again, today, is
thriving, showing that President
Trump keeps his promises.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GOMEZ).
Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, we are
here at this moment in our Nation’s
history because the President abused
the power of his office, bribed a foreign
government to intrude into our democ-
racy, and engaged in an unprecedented
campaign of obstruction of Congress to
cover it up.
Our credibility in the global commu-
nity has been compromised. Our char-
acter and motivations are questioned.
We know where the President’s true
loyalties lie: not with our constituents,
not with our allies, but with our adver-
saries and himself.
Abraham Lincoln once said: ‘‘Nearly
all men can stand adversity, but if you
want to test a man’s character, give
him power.’’
Donald Trump has failed this test,
and now our test is whether we will be

a check on that power. Therefore, we
must hold anyone to account, regard-
less of party or politics, who sets fire
to the very institutions that define our
Nation and our values. With this in
mind, I will vote ‘‘yes’’ to impeach
Donald J. Trump.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from North Carolina (Ms.
FOXX).
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to
the process and to the resolution.
When Congress sees fit to examine its
solemn power of impeachment, it is im-
perative that it does so in genuine pur-
suit of justice: fairly, transparently,
and objectively. Anything less is unac-
ceptable. This partisan impeachment
has fallen far short of that.
Sadly, Alexander Hamilton’s pre-
diction in Federalist No. 65 has come
true, where he warned: ‘‘In many cases,
it will connect itself with the pre-
existing factions and will enlist all
their animosities, partialities, influ-
ence, and interest on one side or on the
other; and in such cases, there will al-
ways be the greatest danger that the
decision will be regulated more by the
comparative strength of parties than
by the real demonstrations of inno-
cence or guilt.’’
After years of investigations, hear-
ings, and millions of taxpayer dollars,
Democrats found no proof that the
President committed a crime—no
proof—as the vague accusations in
these articles clearly reflect.
A basic prerequisite for impeaching
for ‘‘high crimes and misdemeanors’’ is
a charge that an actual crime was com-
mitted. These empty, baseless articles
expose for the American people what
this is: a desperate, partisan attempt
to avenge the loss of the Democrats’
preferred candidate in 2016.
We must respect American voters
and reject these articles.
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Just a quick fact-check before I yield
to the gentleman from Massachusetts.
My colleagues on the other side of
the aisle claim that no Republican wit-
nesses were allowed to testify. That is,
of course, not correct.
In the Intelligence Committee, three
of the Republican-requested witnesses
testified; that is, one out of every four
of the witnesses were Republican-re-
quested witnesses. That they incrimi-
nated the President did not make them
any less requested by the minority.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.
KEATING).
Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, today I
reflect on the imperatives of two sons
of Massachusetts:
John Adams, who, in one sentence,
captured the very foundation of our
country, saying, we are a government
of laws, not men—translation: no one
is above the law; and
John F. Kennedy, who, in his iconic
City Upon a Hill address, cautioned
that any one of us holding public office
would be judged by the high court of
history on whether we were truly men
and women of courage, with the cour-
age to stand up to one’s enemies and
the courage to stand up, as well, to
one’s associates, the courage to resist
public pressure as well as private
greed, and on whether we are truly
men and women of integrity who never
run out of the principles in which we
believe and for whom neither financial
gain nor political ambition could ever
divert from the fulfillment of our sa-
cred trust.
President Donald Trump, indifferent
and disdainful of this sacred trust, con-
spired to extract personal benefit from
his office.
He dishonored his oath. I refuse to
abandon mine.
b 1730
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I
would like to point out very quickly
that the only Republican witnesses al-
lowed in the Intelligence Committee
hearings were on the Democrats’
preapproved list.
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes
to the gentleman from South Carolina
(Mr. RICE).
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I rise in opposition to this
partisan sham of an impeachment reso-
lution that is ripping our country
apart.
Beginning even before he took office,
President Trump has been attacked by
a never-ending barrage of lies, corrup-
tion, and deceit by the liberal political
elite, including James Comey, Peter
Strzok, Lisa Page, Hillary Clinton, and
the impeachment zealots in this Con-
gress.
Democrats colluded with Russia and
Ukraine to interfere in our 2016 elec-
tion by producing the now-famous fake
dossier. Now, they accuse President
Trump of colluding with a foreign
power. What a joke.
They abuse their office to illegally
wiretap and spy on President Trump’s
campaign. Now, they accuse him of
abusing his office. What a joke.
Democrats structure these pro-
ceedings to deny the President and Re-
publicans in Congress a fair hearing.
Then, they accuse the President of ob-
structing Congress. Look in the mirror,
folks.
The reaction of the American people,
that this is contrived and corrupt, was
entirely predictable and is entirely cor-
rect. The polls will turn against them,
and the Democrats are desperate to
stop the bleeding. That is why we are
cramming this vote in today, just be-
fore leaving for recess, to dispose of
impeachment as quickly and painlessly
as possible.
The actions of the Democrats are a
stain on this Chamber. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in fighting against
this shameful abuse of power and vote
‘‘no’’ on this sham of an impeachment
resolution.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I
didn’t think I would have to do another
fact-check so quickly, but, of course,
there was no preapproved witness list.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentleman from New York (Mr.
MEEKS).
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, the de-
cision to impeach a President of the
United States is of enormous mag-
nitude and utmost significance. There
are few issues that so deeply reflect
upon the Constitution and the Amer-
ican system of governance.
As a senior member of the United
States House Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, I have spent years trying to
promote American values of democracy
and the rule of law in other parts of the
world, including Eastern Europe. Be-
cause I have been so steeped in Ukrain-
ian issues for so long, I know how dam-
aging President Trump’s actions were.
But the President’s damage does not
end there. He has consistently ob-
structed at every turn of this inves-
tigation. This Nation’s Founding Fa-
thers fought to end unaccountable rule.
We did not free ourselves from a King
to turn the President into a monarch.
The camera of history is rolling, and
I will cast my vote consistent with the
principles of democracy, the rule of
law, and our Constitution for the im-
peachment of President Donald J.
Trump. I do so because I could not look
my granddaughter or any member of
future generations in the eye having
condoned actions that undermine our
democratic system, and I urge all of
my colleagues to do the same.
May God bless the United States of
America.
I stand before you on a serious and solemn
day in the House of Representatives. The de-
cision to impeach a President of the United
States is of enormous magnitude and the ut-
most significance. There are few issues that
so deeply reflect upon the Constitution and the
American system of governance.
My ancestors were African slaves, forced on
a transatlantic journey from the coasts of Si-
erra Leone to the plantations of South Caro-
lina. I know full well that the designers of our
Constitution, who embedded an economy of
human bondage into the fabric of our political
institutions, were not perfect men. Yet they
wrote a malleable document that allowed
American society to adjust to changing times
while laying down eternal principles: democ-
racy, freedom of speech, freedom of belief,
open markets, and a separation of powers. In-
deed, they laid the foundation for a nation that
would allow men and women like myself, who
are descended from slaves, to become Mem-
bers of Congress with the right and duty to
weigh in on the most important questions con-
fronting our republic. I will exercise that re-
sponsibility here today.
Given my background as a lawyer and
former prosecutor, I believe we must look at
the relevant law in question before casting a
vote. That language comes directly from the
Constitution: ‘‘The President . . . shall be re-
moved from Office on Impeachment for, and
Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high
Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’ The two articles
of impeachment brought against President
Trump concern his abuse of power and his
obstruction of Congress.

trying to promote American values of democ-
racy and the rule of law in other parts of the
world including Eastern Europe. Other nations
have not been blessed with political institu-
tions that promoted civil liberties and the rule
of law. Today, in Ukraine however there are
leaders keen on anticorruption initiatives, in-
vested in following the Western democratic
model, and inspired by the American example.
Nearly 13,000 Ukrainians have been killed
since 2014 because of the conflict provoked
and sustained by Russia, who opposes this vi-
sion of liberty and opportunity.
Over the years, I have pushed for the U.S.
government to fund and protect these Ukrain-
ian freedom fighters from Russian aggression.
As the leader of the United States, President
Trump has responsibility to help Ukraine lay
the ground work for a more sustainable sys-
tem of governance, one that promotes the rule
of law and free and fair elections. This duty is
inextricably linked to American national secu-
rity interests. Because I have been steeped in
these issues pertaining to Ukraine for so long,
I know how damaging President Trump’s ac-
tions were. Based on witness testimony and
the overwhelming evidence presented, I am
forced to conclude that the President abused
the power of his office for his own personal
gain rather than the public interest and that
this was in fact an impeachable offense.
The second article of impeachment con-
cerns President Trump’s obstruction of Con-
gress. Our constitutional system was designed
to promote checks and balances among the
different branches of government, with a par-
ticular focus on ensuring that the judiciary and
the legislature could check the President. We
did not free ourselves from a King to tum the
President into a monarch.
In the case of our current President, he has
shown his disdain for separation of powers
unrelentingly and unrepentantly. This pattern
of behavior evidenced throughout the Mueller
investigation and repeated itself again as the
President has continually defied any oversight
initiatives from the legislature. This is in com-
plete contravention of our Constitutional sys-
tem. And it is an impeachable offense.
In sum, the founders knew from the very be-
ginning that the insertion of domestic political
interests into foreign policy would be an exis-
tential threat to the United States. Indeed,
confidence in our electoral system at home
has been indispensable to the strength of our
republic while the absence of quid pro quo
corruption from our foreign policy has been
essential to American leadership abroad.
President Trump’s misconduct has betrayed
both of these vital principals, weakening our
democratic institutions at home and our stand-
ing abroad.
The camera of history is rolling. Today’s
vote is not about one man, but instead about
the foundations of our republic for the years,
decades, and centuries to come. I will cast my
vote consistent with the principles of democ-
racy, the rule of law, and the American con-
stitutional system and for the impeachment of
President Donald J. Trump. I do so because
I could not look my granddaughter or any
member of future generations in the eye hav-
ing condoned actions that undermine our
democratic system.
I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.
May God bless the United States of Amer-
ica.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON).
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I am
strongly opposed to this impeachment.
No law was broken, no high crimes or
misdemeanors, no impeachable of-
fenses.
The Ukrainians received aid 1 week
prior to the law’s requirement, aid that
was previously rejected by the adminis-
tration before it. There was no inves-
tigation, and President Zelensky said
he received no pressure from the
Trump administration ever.
Simply put, there was no quid pro
quo and no crime. There was only the
majority’s disdain for the President,
and that is not an impeachable offense.
The elections are in 10 months, but
the majority doesn’t trust the Amer-
ican people. Too many have said that
the impeachment is necessary so that
the President is not reelected in 2020,
and that is shameful.
Today’s vote sets a new precedent for
America. In the future, the majority
will use impeachment as a tactic to re-
move a President simply based on par-
tisanship. Our Founders feared this,
and I strongly oppose it.
I want my statement to be in the
RECORD until the end of time to show
that I was on the side of the Constitu-
tion, that I oppose the majority taking
down a duly elected President who
committed no crime, and that I de-
fended the truth.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, my
colleagues continue to make the argu-
ment that the Ukrainians got the
money. Yes, the President got caught,
but they got the money. No harm, no
foul.
It is the equivalent of saying that if
you are pulled over by a cop and you
attempt to bribe the cop, and the cop
doesn’t take the money but arrests
you, well, where is the crime in that?
They didn’t get the money.
This is what my colleagues would
have you accept. This is what my col-
leagues would have you accept, that
because the President got caught in
the act, we must look the other way.
Of course, that is not the way the law
works. That is not the way the Con-
stitution works. That is not the way
our oath of office works.
Our oath of office requires us to im-
peach a President who abuses his
power, whether he gets away with it or
he gets caught. In this case, he got
caught.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.
NORCROSS).
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I
rise today at a time of grave concern
for all Americans.
This past weekend, I joined a bipar-
tisan delegation traveling to Belgium
and Luxembourg for the 75th anniver-
sary of the Battle of the Bulge, a battle
in which over 19,000 Americans gave
their lives. Today, we are called to pre-
serve that democracy that they so
bravely defended.
Over 2 years ago, I was one of the
first Members of Congress to vote to
advance the inquiry. Since then, I have
withheld final judgment as I reviewed
the facts and heard the testimony.
I believe there is overwhelming evi-
dence well beyond a reasonable doubt
that President Donald Trump is guilty
in both Articles of Impeachment, abuse
of power and obstruction of Congress.
Therefore, I will uphold my oath to
protect and defend the Constitution of
the United States in favor of impeach-
ment.
It is our solemn responsibility to
honor all those who have fought and
given their lives to uphold the truth. In
America, no one is above the law.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Wow, I just
love this, again, potshot it in when you
can.
Remember, quid pro quo didn’t work
out really well for them because that
was supposedly who had pressure on
President Zelensky. In fact, it didn’t
work out, so, well, you had to go poll
test it. The majority didn’t work out
because focus groups didn’t like it.
So, what do we do? We throw it in
here, a bribe. It is all in their report,
but if they had a bribe or if they actu-
ally had a crime, it would be in the ar-
ticles.
Guess what? He doesn’t have it. He
can’t put it in there. This is all fluff
and circumstance because they can’t
get to the President, and that is what
is killing them.
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes
to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.
BUCSHON).
Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker,
House Democrats have been obsessed
with impeaching President Trump
since he was elected.
He wasn’t supposed to win. ‘‘How
could the voters support him?’’ they
asked.
The American people were told the
only way the Speaker would move for-
ward with impeachment was if the case
was compelling, overwhelming, and bi-
partisan, yet the case for impeachment
that has been rushed forward by House
Democrats is anything but that.
To be clear, neither of these Articles
of Impeachment prove any wrongdoing
or impeachable offense has actually
taken place. Instead, House Democrats’
case rests solely on hearsay testimony
and presumptions from cherry-picked
witnesses.
The Framers of the Constitution
never intended impeachment to be used
as a tool to settle political and policy
differences. That is what elections are
for.
This is a sad and dangerous moment
in our history, as impeachment is
being used to undo the will of the
American people and silence the voices
of millions of Americans in the process.
Alexander Hamilton would be ashamed.
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on
this partisan impeachment sham.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield

rado (Mr. CROW).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H12176 December 18, 2019
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, years
ago, I took my first oath to the coun-
try, went to war, and fought alongside
our Nation’s finest men and women.
Some of them gave their lives for our
Nation. Not a day has passed that I
don’t reflect on those sacrifices.
I learned during that time that our
Nation is built on sacrifice. We have
overcome challenging times because
people have decided to put aside their
personal interests, their livelihoods,
and, yes, even given their lives to do
what is best for our Nation.
Our Founders created a system to en-
sure we would have no kings or dic-
tators, a system that vested power in
the people to ensure that no man or
woman is above the law.
Generation after generation, this sys-
tem has survived because people have
fought for it. Today, it is our turn.
The President’s abuse of power and
scorn for our constitutional checks and
balances is unprecedented. Unless we
stand up against these abuses, we will
set the country on a dangerous new
course.
My oath, my love of our country, and
my duty to honor the sacrifices of
those who came before us require me to
act. To my colleagues, it is time to put
aside our personal and political inter-
ests and honor those who have come
before us.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 35 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. HICE).
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, the Democrats’ new definition for
evidence is allegations, allegations
based on hearsay, I might add. So, they
hurl allegations against the President,
and then they say to him that it is not
their responsibility to prove guilt but
the President’s responsibility to prove
his innocence.
This impeachment has been a sham
and an act of injustice against the
President and against 63 million Amer-
icans who voted for him. Although this
process was rigged from the beginning,
Democrats never produced a single true
piece of evidence.
It is time for us to stop this hoax and
vote against these Articles of Impeach-
ment.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Mrs. LURIA).
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in support of our Constitution, in
support of the military members in
harm’s way who defend our Constitu-
tion, in support of Gold Star families
who keep faith that their loved one’s
sacrifice was justified.
I rise today in support of the oath I
first took at 17 upon entering the
Naval Academy and took five more
times in my 20-year Navy career; an
oath that comforted me in the years I
spent away from my family, deployed
around the globe; an oath that encour-
aged me to remain vigilant on the
bridge of the ship at night; an oath
that strengthened me when in com-
mand, as I sent my fellow sailors into
harm’s way; and today, an oath that
gives me resolve to do what is right
and not what is politically expedient,
resolve to stand with the President at
the White House last week, and resolve
to stand up to the President in this
House today.
I ask my colleagues to have the same
strength and the same resolve.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 35 seconds to the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr.
WALKER).
Mr. WALKER. Madam Speaker, when
emotions supersede the facts, the con-
clusion is cataclysmic. Today, we are
wrapping up not a 3-month process but,
rather, a 3-year process with Demo-
crats’ disdain so much that it has led
to the abuse of this very House.
These are the same Democrats who
promised America they saw evidence of
Russian collusion. Do the American
people trust them? Hell, no, they don’t.
A growing number of American peo-
ple have condemned this impeachment
process, and that is with House Demo-
crats setting the rules and then even
bending and breaking the rules to fit
their narrative. The majority of Ameri-
cans see this circus for what it is. I
wonder how many more will join them.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. ESHOO).
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to defend our Constitution and
our democracy by voting for the two
Articles of Impeachment.
The words of our sacred oath define
our duty, and those words must be
kept. Our Founders’ primal fear was
that powerful members of our govern-
ment would become, in Hamilton’s
words, ‘‘mercenary instruments of for-
eign corruption.’’
President Trump abused the powers
of the Presidency by ignoring and in-
juring national security and other vital
national interests to obtain an im-
proper personal benefit. He also be-
trayed our Nation by abusing his high
office to enlist a foreign power in cor-
rupting democratic elections.
Article II I agree with because it de-
tails the obstruction of Congress by the
President by directing unprecedented,
categorical, and indiscriminate defi-
ance of subpoenas issued by this House
of Representatives and abused the pow-
ers of the Presidency in a manner sub-
versive to the Constitution.
I believe the Constitution is the soul
of our Nation, and by defending it, we
are saying we will not be soulless.
b 1745
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 35 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR).
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, don’t be
fooled. Democrats are not impeaching
the President to protect national secu-
rity.
Democrats are impeaching the Presi-
dent for following a law that they
themselves voted for.
No less than five times in the last 6
years, bipartisan Congresses imposed
on the executive branch an affirmative
duty to ensure that the Government of
Ukraine was countering corruption.
And for good reason: Ukraine is the
third-most corrupt nation on Earth.
So the President not only had the
legal authority to temporarily pause
security assistance to Ukraine, he had
a mandate from Congress to do it.
As a result, President Zelensky’s
government made historic
anticorruption reforms, making
Ukraine a more reliable ally, coun-
tering Russian aggression.
Far from compromising national se-
curity, the President’s actions ad-
vanced national security.
Oppose this impeachment.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, my colleagues
would have the country believe that
the President held up the aid to
Ukraine because he was concerned
about corruption. Of course, there is
not a shred of evidence for that.
All of the national security experts
across all the departments testified
that Ukraine met the criteria to re-
ceive the aid.
So what was the real motivation
here? Well, one thing is telling. In 2017,
the President had no problem with aid
to Ukraine, raised no issue of corrup-
tion. In 2018, he had no problem with
the military aid for Ukraine.
So what changed in 2019? Joe Biden
announced he was running for Presi-
dent, and all of a sudden, Donald
Trump held up the aid for Ukraine.
As Ambassador Sondland testified,
the President didn’t care about
Ukraine. All he cared about was the big
stuff that affected him personally, the
investigation of the Bidens that
Giuliani was pushing.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms.
SPANBERGER).
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker,
I rise today in support of H. Res. 755.
As a CIA case officer, I used to meet
with foreign nationals who were pro-
viding vital intelligence to help inform
our hardest national security decisions
and keep our country safe. These indi-
viduals, from countries where leaders
abused their power and defied the rule
of law, risked imprisonment and often
their very lives in order to provide the
United States with information to help
us, to inform us.
But why? It was their belief in the
United States, their belief in our coun-
try, the longest-standing democracy in
the world; our country, a beacon of
hope in the world, a democratic repub-
lic founded on a document and the be-
lief in the rule of law and a belief in its
people.
Today, I am proud to serve in the
people’s House, representing my home-
town and again serving our country,
that beacon of hope in the world.
And today, especially today, I reflect
on the founding documents that have
set us apart in the world, leading peo-
ple across generations and across the

world to risk everything because of
their belief in our great Nation.
Today, especially today, I affirm my
commitment to upholding and pro-
tecting the Constitution, the rule of
law it defines, and the people it gov-
erns.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 35 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON).
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker,
today, many of my Democratic col-
leagues will be making history, unfor-
tunately, for supporting the first–ever
completely partisan impeachment of a
President of the United States.
Madam Speaker, I am deeply dis-
turbed that history will indeed be made
today in this hallowed Chamber, but
for all the wrong reasons: not for love
of country, but hatred for a political
foe; not to pursue justice, but to punish
a political adversary; not to seek
truth, but to seize political power.
Madam Speaker, for the love of coun-
try, I urge my colleagues to oppose this
disastrous political ruse.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
3 minutes to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. WATERS).
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, la-
dies and gentlemen, unfortunately, the
rules of debate won’t allow me to cite
all of the reasons why this President
should be impeached. There are many.
However, Madam Speaker and Mem-
bers of this House, to quote the late
Maya Angelou: ‘‘When someone shows
you who they are, believe them the
first time.’’
This day was not inevitable, but it
was predictable, because this President
has shown himself time and time again
to believe that he is above the law, and
he has no respect for our Constitution
or our democracy.
Based on all that we know about
Donald Trump, we could have predicted
he would have abused the power of the
Presidency by ‘‘corruptly soliciting the
Government of Ukraine’’ and Ukrain-
ian President Zelensky to publicly an-
nounce investigations into his political
opponent, former Vice President Jo-
seph R. Biden.
This impeachment resolution in-
cludes evidence that this President
withheld $391 million of taxpayer funds
that Congress appropriated for the pur-
pose of providing vital military and se-
curity assistance to Ukraine to oppose
Russian aggression, another blatant
abuse of power.
Our investigations revealed that this
President advanced ‘‘a discredited the-
ory promoted by Russia alleging that
Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered
in the 2016 United States Presidential
election.’’
‘‘For corrupt purposes in pursuit of
personal political benefit.’’
Never before in our history have we
experienced a President who has so
clearly conducted himself in a ‘‘man-
ner offensive to, and subversive of, the
Constitution,’’ and who directed his
Cabinet members, executive branch
agencies, and other White House offi-
cials to defy lawful subpoenas from
Congress.
Was he attempting to hide wrong-
doing?
It is without question that this Presi-
dent ‘‘has demonstrated that he will
remain a threat to national security
and the Constitution if allowed to re-
main in office, and has acted in a man-
ner grossly incompatible with self-gov-
ernance and the rule of law,’’ because
at every turn, he has shown us who he
is.
It is no secret that this President
could have been impeached a long time
ago.
Today, we stand here with an irref-
utable case and an indisputable set of
facts that this President absolutely
abused his power and obstructed Con-
gress.
Any other individual who would have
been caught conducting themselves in
the way this President has would have
been prosecuted to the full extent of
the law.
It is shameful that any Members of
this House are willing to disregard the
Constitution, turn a blind eye to hard
facts, and ignore a confession from the
President himself.
History will remember those who
were willing to speak truth to power.
Yes, I called for Trump’s impeach-
ment early.
This is our country. Our foremothers
and our forefathers shed their blood to
build and defend this democracy. I
refuse to have it undermined.
I wholeheartedly support this resolu-
tion. I am proud that, in the final anal-
ysis, justice will have been served in
America and Donald Trump will have
been impeached.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, reclaiming my time that the
gentlewoman did not have, I yield 35
seconds to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. ABRAHAM).
Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam Speaker,
what is shameful is that Speaker
PELOSI has allowed this Democratic
witch hunt to move forward. She is the
one that has abused her power, and we
should be debating her removal from
the House.
Reagan said that: ‘‘The trouble with
our liberal friends is not that they are
ignorant, it is just that they know so
much that isn’t so.’’
Democrat extreme partisanship will
set a dangerous precedent for this Na-
tion. And mark my words, Madam
Speaker: This sinister attempt to re-
move this lawful President will not go
unnoticed.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms.
TITUS) for a unanimous consent re-
quest.
(Ms. TITUS asked and was given per-
mission to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. TITUS. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD my statement sup-
porting the impeachment of Donald
Trump.
For 35 years I taught American government
to university students.
When we discussed impeachment, I never
thought I’d actually be participating in the
process, but this president has left us no
choice.
He tried to rig the 2020 elections by solic-
iting foreign interference, and then engaged in
an unprecedented cover-up once he got
caught.
No president can be permitted to abuse the
power of the office for personal, political gain,
nor try to hide his misdeeds by demanding
that his subordinates withhold key documents
and refuse to testify before Congress.
President Trump’s allies have offered lots of
crazy excuses for why he shouldn’t be im-
peached, but even they will not deny that he
wouldn’t have asked Ukraine to investigate
Biden if the former Vice President weren’t a
leading candidate for president.
I have analyzed the evidence thoroughly. It
is consistent and convincing. That is why I am
casting my vote to impeach President Trump.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Con-
necticut (Mr. HIMES).
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in anger and hope.
I am angry that President Donald
Trump has treated his oath of office so
disrespectfully that now we must hold
him to account.
The truth is clear to anyone not de-
liberately looking away. The President
withheld military aid and a White
House meeting unless and until a vul-
nerable Ukrainian President an-
nounced a nakedly political investiga-
tion.
It didn’t matter if the Ukrainians un-
covered any wrongdoing. The mere an-
nouncement of an investigation would
damage his political opponent.
Mr. Trump didn’t care about stopping
corruption in Ukraine. He never men-
tioned the word ‘‘corruption’’ once in
the infamous July 25 call. This was not
an attempt to reduce Ukrainian cor-
ruption.
It was an attempt by Donald J.
Trump to aim Ukrainian corruption
straight at the heart of the Presi-
dential election of 2020.
The President knows this, which is
why he has not given this Congress a
single email, phone record, or docu-
ment.
That is not the behavior of a man
with nothing to hide. It is, simply and
undeniably, contempt of this Congress.
But what makes this impeachment
essential is that the President’s abuse
of power has not stopped. As we speak,
he continues to urge foreign inter-
ference in our democracy: beseeching
China to investigate the Bidens, send-
ing Rudy Giuliani overseas to chase
Russian conspiracy theories.
This morning, the President tweeted,
‘‘I did nothing wrong,’’ all caps. He be-
lieves it, too. He sees nothing wrong
with inviting Russian, Ukrainian, or
Chinese interference into our election.
He did it, he continues to do it, and
he sees nothing wrong with it. He will
wake up tomorrow and do it again if we
don’t stop him today.
Therein lies our hope.

H12178 December 18, 2019
Madam Speaker, I am proud today to
answer the call to defend our democ-
racy and the United States Constitu-
tion, and I urge my colleagues to do
the same.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, for reasons that I really don’t
understand, I am having to yield 30 sec-
onds to the gentleman from Mississippi
(Mr. KELLY).
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam
Speaker, I am saddened today that I
spent two Christmases defending our
country overseas, and I get a measly 30
seconds to speak in this laughable
process.
Our President made a campaign
promise to drain the swamp, and there
are those today relying on swamp crea-
tures’ words to preserve the swamp.
How do you suppress the votes of 63
million people in an electoral land-
slide? You keep repeating the same lies
absent any factual basis.
I have heard some of the greatest fic-
tion ever spoken here today. If you
don’t like the facts, just rewrite them
in a parody and repeat.
If the facts are so clear and indis-
putable, why is the minority leader
begging for more witnesses?
You can’t disprove something that
never happened.
Mr. Speaker, due to a rushed process and
limited debate, I was not allocated time to
speak on the Floor ahead of this monumental
vote, an opportunity that every member should
be afforded.
I have spent two Christmases down range,
defending our Constitution and Country, and it
is a sad day when something this historic is
rushed to a desired result so my colleagues
will be home in time for the holidays.
I am disappointed in this body for putting
their own convenience over the sanctity of our
Nation.
I will tell you this: I would rather face attacks
from our Nation’s enemies than an attack on
our Constitution.
This is the first time in history that impeach-
ment proceedings have been completely par-
tisan, shrouded in secrecy, and based on he-
said-she-said accusations.
As a former prosecutor, I find it insulting my
colleagues have built a case on second hand
accounts, editorials, and opinions.
When the facts do not support the elements
of crime, my experience tells me there is no
crime.
Under the Constitution, it is the duty of the
prosecution to prove the crime and not the ac-
cused to prove their innocence.
The House has wasted time and tax dollars
on an unfounded witch hunt instead of legis-
lating on behalf of our country.
Upon passage along party lines, the Senate
will then be obligated to continue this circus at
the expense of the American people.
Today is a stain on this esteemed body for
generations to come and a detrimental prece-
dent is set for future presidencies.
Today is a day of reckoning and a day the
framers of our Constitution warned us about.
James Madison foresaw this day when he
feared the vague and heavily-disputed claims
by my colleagues would turn our republic into
an unruly parliamentary system in which Con-
gress could remove a president over political
differences with only partisan motives as evi-
dence.
The power to impeach the President is the
single most important vote that a member of
this body can cast.
It should not be taken lightly, and it certainly
shouldn’t be rushed through the House.
Alexander Hamilton feared the greatest dan-
ger of abusing impeachment authority is that
the decision would be ‘‘regulated more by the
comparative strength of parties than the real
demonstration of innocence or guilt.’’
The fears of our Founding Fathers have
manifested in this Chamber today.
We face a partisan process that will jeop-
ardize our 243-year experiment at self-govern-
ance, now, and for decades to come.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues
to vote ‘‘no’’ to this sham.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI).
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam
Speaker, like many of my colleagues, I
never ran for Congress wanting or ex-
pecting to impeach anybody, let alone
the President of the United States.
However, given the facts, here we
are.
While some questions remain unan-
swered, two key facts are clear and
compel me to support the Articles of
Impeachment.
First, President Trump attempted to
pressure a foreign government to help
his reelection campaign.
And second, the President used the
powers of his office to obstruct a con-
gressional investigation into that
wrongdoing.
The President has falsely claimed he
has been denied the chance to defend
himself, but at the same time, he is
preventing the testimony of witnesses
with direct knowledge of the events
under investigation.
If the President were innocent, as he
claims, surely these witnesses would be
able to testify to that. If there had
been no quid pro quo, these witnesses
could say that. If aid to Ukraine were
not intentionally delayed for improper
purposes, they could surely testify to
that also.
But rather than giving these wit-
nesses the chance to speak, the Presi-
dent has silenced them. The President
has silenced witnesses at the Defense
Department. The President has si-
lenced witnesses at the State Depart-
ment. The President has silenced wit-
nesses at the White House. He even si-
lenced the loquacious Mick Mulvaney,
who uttered at a press conference that
there was a quid pro quo and ‘‘get over
it.’’
By choosing to block this testimony,
the President is not proving his inno-
cence; he is just proving he is afraid of
what they have to say.
As a wise man once said, the truth
will come to light. And it has. It is our
duty to act on it.

Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, it is a shame, on the floor of
this House, when you accuse somebody
and then make them prove they are
not guilty of what you are accusing
them of.
Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to
the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.
JOHN W. ROSE).
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, today, I rise in strong
opposition to this partisan impeach-
ment spectacle that just seeks to ac-
complish what President Trump’s op-
ponents failed to do at the ballot box in
2016.
Our votes today are merely for-
malizing the decision my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle reached 3
years ago. This has been an embarrass-
ment to our country, an insult to our
Constitution, and a distraction from
the real work we should be accom-
plishing for the American people.
I stand with the people of Ten-
nessee’s Sixth District in strongly sup-
porting President Trump, and I will
vote against the Articles of Impeach-
ment before us today.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA).
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, in
her own words, Speaker PELOSI said
impeachment must be compelling,
overwhelming, and bipartisan. These
Articles of Impeachment being consid-
ered today by the House fail to meet
Speaker PELOSI’s own standards.
Process matters, folks. Representing
a good chunk of Gerald Ford’s old dis-
trict and being a staffer during the
Clinton administration, I have an inti-
mate understanding of the effects of
impeachment on this Nation. I am
stunned to see my Democratic col-
leagues whitewash, or maybe I should
say ‘‘Whitewater,’’ Bill Clinton’s co-
operation with the House of Represent-
atives. That is not exactly what was
going on.
This is the most partisan impeach-
ment that we have seen in our Nation’s
history.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. CLOUD).
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, it has
been very clear from the beginning
that this impeachment proceeding has
never been about an honest search for
the truth. If it were, our Democratic
friends would not have polled to see
what to charge the President with.
Calling an opinion a fact does not
make it so, and repeating it over and
over does not make it more true. When
one produces a committee report with
fabricated findings based on no fact
witnesses and then quotes from it like
it is authoritative, it is no more valid
than having a campaign pay for a for-
eign entity to create a private dossier
and then selling it to a FISA court in
order to spy on a campaign.
This has always been a verdict in
search of a crime, an impeachment

Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I con-

Mr. FULCHER. Madam Speaker, in a

every high crime and misdemeanor

Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Madam Speak-
er, my heart aches for our great Repub-

colleagues in this House: We are not
Republicans or Democrats. We are
Americans.
This is not the right place. This is
not the right procedure. Settle our po-
litical differences politically.
We owe the American people a great
duty to come together. Don’t give the
Senate the victory lap. Give the House
the victory lap. Vote ‘‘no’’ to impeach.
We owe it to the American people.
They want so dearly for us to come
together for our great Republic and
thank our great President.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I con-

Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, may I inquire of the time re-
maining for both the majority and the

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 43 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from Cali-
fornia has 29 minutes remaining.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. WALTZ).
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, I am a
Green Beret and a proud veteran, but
this process does not make me proud. I
fought all over the world, from Africa
to Afghanistan, and I have seen fair
and more transparent processes than
this.
Since the Democrats lost the election
in 2016, they have been focused on im-
peaching this President. Meanwhile, we
have not solved the problems America
entrusted us to solve: immigration,
healthcare, and infrastructure.
Nothing in President Trump’s call
rises to the level of high crimes and
misdemeanors worthy of impeachment.
For that reason, I will be voting
against impeachment today.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE).
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in opposition to the Articles
of Impeachment on President Trump.
My Democratic colleagues have been
planning to impeach President Trump
since he took office. After months of
wasting House time on partisan inves-
tigations, they have been unable to
produce evidence that President Trump
committed a crime.
I will vote ‘‘no’’ on today’s Articles
of Impeachment. I look forward to get-
ting back to the business on behalf of
Kentuckians.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY).
Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of
New York. Madam Speaker, the facts
and the evidence establish beyond per-
adventure that the President abused
the power of his office for personal gain
and sought to cover up his misconduct
by obstructing the Congress.
What we do today goes to the heart
of the oath we take to support and de-
fend the Constitution. These actions
are as necessary as they are heart-
breaking.
It is the President, not any Member
of this House, who has brought us to
this sad place. His actions echo in this
Chamber and, like a tin can tied to his
leg, will rattle behind him through the
pages of history.
For in the final analysis, none of us
will escape the truth. It will come for
us all in this world or the next.
What is the truth? The President
used taxpayer money and official acts
to pressure a foreign government to
help him win reelection by slandering a
fellow American.
How do we know this truth? We know
because brave Americans, soldiers and
public servants, came forward to reveal
the President’s misconduct.
And the President? He continues to
undertake an unprecedented coverup to
stonewall the public and obstruct their
Representatives in Congress. He with-
holds access to documents and records
belonging to the public that would fur-
ther establish his mendacity. He blocks
his advisers and associates from testi-
fying before the public to conceal the
wrongs they witnessed.
These actions are unworthy of the
Presidency.
Today is about right and wrong and
whether we still know the difference.
Today, we hold the President account-
able. If we fail to do so, future Presi-
dents would see corruption as without
consequence. And there, our democracy
goes to die.
We inherit this Republic from our an-
cestors, and we borrow it from our chil-
dren. With humility, we pray that the
history of this day will guide us to a
better future for our Nation.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Missouri (Mr. LONG).
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, we have
never, ever, in the history of this coun-
try, seen a Presidency like this one.
Once the President was sworn in, 19
minutes later, The Washington Post
said impeachment begins today. A mil-
lion women marched the next day in
Washington. Bank of America and
Starbucks, both who supported Hillary
Clinton, had their windows broken out
here in Washington because people
were so upset that this man was elect-
ed President of the United States.
He has had his head held under water
for almost 3 years now, never coming
up for a breath of air, just keep push-
ing him down.
Lowest Black unemployment ever,
lowest Hispanic unemployment ever,
highest stock market ever, and the
very lowest unemployment in years.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Nebraska (Mr. FORTEN-
BERRY).
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speak-
er, I have been concerned since the be-
ginning of this impeachment process
that it has been driven by a predeter-
mined guilty verdict.
It is unfair. It is wrong. And now,
every future President, Democrat or
Republican, will have to worry that the
impeachment process will be driven as
a blunt-force political instrument.
It has been said that this day is sad.
It is not sad; it is regrettable. But this
day will end shortly. The House has
had its cathartic moment. Tomorrow
will begin a new day. Let’s get back to
work.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA).
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker,
ready, fire, aim.
What we are hearing today are made-
up articles to fit an ever-shrinking im-
peachment foothold. George Wash-
ington could be impeached under this
criteria.
Democrats believe they are saving
our democracy with these hysterical,
made-up charges, which is odd because
we are a republic, not a democracy, as
they keep insisting.
No one came to Congress to impeach,
we hear. Several new and returning
Members have come specifically to im-
peach President Trump.
I hear a lot today about sadness and
solemnity. From impeachment? No, be-
cause their candidate lost in 2016. The
American people chose Donald J.
Trump to lead us into prosperity, not a
socialist government.
We will survive this day, but I call
upon the American people to see
through this sham, heal, and unite by
speaking the truth.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my

Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from South Dakota (Mr. JOHN-
SON).
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.
Madam Speaker, I am voting ‘‘no.’’
Impeachment is not in the best inter-
est of this country. In fact, it has only
deepened the partisan divide that truly
plagues this country.
When the Sun comes up tomorrow, I
pray with all my heart that the anger
and the division in this Chamber will
give way to an honorableness, a pro-
ductivity, and a time of working to-
gether.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Alabama (Mr. ADERHOLT).
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker,
today, a duly elected President is being
impeached by the House of Representa-
tives, by the Democrats compelled by
partisanship and not by the facts.
I am proud to stand here with Presi-
dent Donald Trump, and I plan to cast
my vote against both Articles of Im-
peachment.
It is not that the President abused
his power. It is my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle who are abusing
one of the most powerful tools that has
been entrusted to Congress in the Con-
stitution by our Founding Fathers.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON).
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, Web-
ster’s dictionary defines the star cham-
ber as ‘‘characterized by secrecy and
often being irresponsibly arbitrary and
oppressive.’’
Sadly, my Democratic friends have
turned this Chamber, the people’s
Chamber, into the star chamber of the
people.
One great example is the most impor-
tant thing we can do as Members is de-
clare war. The next one is to impeach
a President.
We are hoping Republicans can have
every Member stand up and vote, like
for Speaker, and say their vote loudly.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMP-
SON).
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, while this institution
should rightfully ensure the law is
faithfully executed by the administra-
tive branch, this exercise has shown
itself to be the ultimate manipulation
of the legislative branch’s oversight
powers in order to achieve political
gains.
I caution my colleagues, who have
placed political expediency ahead of
moderation, their votes later today
will forever change this institution.
Imagine a future where this body uti-
lizes the most severe of its constitu-
tional tools to continually put the op-
position party on trial.
Madam Speaker, the American peo-
ple have elected their Representatives
to be their voice and vote on matters
most important to this country. We
must collectively focus on these issues,
not on the political impulses of a few.
This cannot become the new normal.
I will be voting a resounding ‘‘no’’ on
these Articles of Impeachment.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, it is
my pleasure to yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Maryland (Mr.
BROWN).
b 1815
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam
Speaker, when I was commissioned a
second lieutenant in the United States
Army, I swore an oath to support and
defend the Constitution, and I have
done so 13 times in my 35 years of pub-
lic service. That oath means every-
thing: to serve and fight for our coun-
try and to protect and promote our val-
ues.
Yet, President Trump betrayed his
oath. He abused his power, the im-
mense power of the Presidency. He
threatened our elections by inviting
foreign interference. He chose inves-
tigating a political rival over defending
our national security.
So, today, we must use our power,
the extraordinary power endowed by
our Constitution and entrusted by the
people: the power to impeach. We must
hold President Trump accountable or
else we will be complicit in under-
mining our democracy, our security,
and our dignity.
His conduct demonstrates his
unfitness to serve as Commander in
Chief and warrants removal from of-
fice. The oath I took as a Member of
Congress is the same I took as a sol-
dier, an oath that reminds me values
matter, that duty, honor, and the rule
of law matter.
To keep my oath to the people I
serve, the country I love, today I will
vote to impeach the President of the
United States.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD).
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I have
said from the beginning of this process,
impeachment is and should be the nu-
clear option reserved for the most trea-
sonous activity and the most serious
activity. Clearly, that has not been
met here.
As I reviewed the facts and evidence,
as a former Federal prosecutor—I have
read the transcripts; I have watched
the hearings; I have read the whistle-
blower report—that has not been met
here.
In addition, this process has lacked
fairness, due process, and trans-
parency.
We shouldn’t be here tonight doing
this. This is a travesty.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HARRIS).
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, it is
unbelievable to the few Americans who
are going to be watching this because
they know what the outcome is. We all
know what the outcome is.
They are wondering: Why are we try-
ing to negate the vote of 63 million
Americans instead of talking about the
things that Americans care about: pre-
scription drug coverage, the high cost
of prescription drugs, the high cost of
healthcare, securing our borders, keep-
ing our economy going? These are the
things we should be talking about.
No, instead, we are going to pass this
resolution tonight and then go home
for Christmas vacation instead of doing
the job of America.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. WATKINS).
Mr. WATKINS. Madam Speaker, I
was a political newcomer before this;
and just like President Trump, perhaps
like me, he was naive to think that
this House, that in the people’s House,
everybody was true and just. That is
not the case.
Democrats weren’t saddened by this
sullen day. They weren’t waiting for all
of the evidence. This was always about
politics because they loathe the Presi-
dent because he doesn’t play by their
beltway rules.
I should have known.
But the fact is Kansas is better, the
U.S. is better, and the world is better
because of Donald Trump.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. CALVERT).
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, my
friends on the other side of the aisle
have been clamoring for this day since
President Trump was elected.
The refusal to accept the election re-
sults and, later, the findings of the
Mueller investigation have brought
forth Articles of Impeachment that are
negated by two simple facts, namely,
the military aid to Ukraine was pro-
vided, and no investigation was ever
started.
The real offense is that the President
won the election, and their fear is that
he will win again, despite all of their
efforts.
I will vote against the partisan at-
tempt to overturn the election.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my

Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H12181
December 18, 2019
This is based on hearsay that was
made by partisan witnesses behind
closed doors. This impeachment is a
sham, Madam Speaker, and it has di-
vided this country.
Congress’ wasted time on this im-
peachment would have been better used
to address issues that are facing Amer-
icans, like securing our southern bor-
der, the opioid epidemic, or estab-
lishing a constitutionally mandated
budget.
Now American workers have to wait
until the Senate trial to pass USMCA
that the President and the House Re-
publicans have been working on for
over a year.
I am disappointed in the path Con-
gress chose to go down.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR).
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, it is
obvious today that there is an intense
hatred by the Democrats for President
Donald Trump.
Why do they hate the man so much?
Maybe it is because of the out-of-con-
trol government gone wild: the abuses
of FISA, the abuses of the FBI, the
abuses in the State Department.
Maybe it is just the previous admin-
istration they are trying to cover up.
It is sad. This is a shameful act in
what we are doing today.
Shame on the Democrats. Shame on
them for pursuing this.
I ask every Member to vote ‘‘no’’ and
to take notice of who votes for these
Articles of Impeachment.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. POSEY).
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, this is
a sad day for America.
We know this impeachment is a
sham. They know this impeachment is
a sham. They know we know this im-
peachment is a sham, and they know
that most of the American people know
that this impeachment is a shameful
sham.
We know that it began the moment
the President was elected, long before
he ever had a telephone call with any
foreign leaders. We have heard the nu-
merous quotations from them that
validate those very points, yet they
persist in trying to overturn the duly
elected President of the United States
of America’s election.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I have heard several
of my colleagues in a row now, and it
is interesting to see how very few of
them want to address any of the facts
of the President’s misconduct.
Apparently, Madam Speaker, I have
struck a nerve. Nor do they wish to de-
fend a President who would extort an
ally, withhold military aid to help him
cheat in an election.
They don’t want to defend that con-
duct, so, instead, they say: Oh, Demo-
crats really want to impeach the Presi-
dent, or Democrats don’t like the
President.
But what they can’t say is that this
President’s conduct was ethical.
What they can’t say was that this
President’s conduct was legal.
What they can’t say was this Presi-
dent’s conduct was constitutional.
What they can’t say is this President
has upheld his oath of office.
No, they can’t say that. All they can
say is: We don’t like the process, or,
Our colleagues are just too happy to
impeach, or, It is overturning the will
of the public when it is a Republican
President.
Interestingly, my colleagues who
supported the impeachment of Bill
Clinton did not think it was over-
turning the will of the people. Appar-
ently, this impeachment provision only
overturns the will of the people if it is
a Republican President.
I would like to give them more credit
than that.
What is the distinction here is the se-
riousness of the conduct. This remedy
was put in the Constitution for a rea-
son. It is not an unconstitutional rem-
edy. It is part of the Constitution.
The only way you can conceive of
this remedy as being unconstitutional
is if you believe, as the President does,
that he is the state, that anything that
opposes him opposes the state and is,
by definition, anticonstitutional.
But that, of course, is nonsense. But
it is more than nonsense; it is dan-
gerous nonsense.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentlewoman from Washington
(Ms. SCHRIER).
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, the
people of Washington’s Eighth District
sent me to Congress to fight for their
families and make thoughtful, evi-
dence-based decisions.
I did not come to Congress to im-
peach a President, but evidence is evi-
dence, and a balance of power is funda-
mental to our democracy.
On my first day in office, like every-
body else here, I took an oath to up-
hold the Constitution and protect our
country. History will judge this mo-
ment. Given all of the facts before us,
impeachment is the only remedy.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Madam Speaker, I am sure it did
strike a chord with the chairman since
he showed up a little late, hadn’t heard
all of the arguments. We beat the facts
back all the time. It is the majority
side that had to run through this. That
clock and that calendar are killing
him, and it is killing him because his
arguments are falling flat.
To speak of evidence, we looked at
the evidence, and the evidence doesn’t
fit anything.
And by the way, if the gentleman had
extortion, put in articles. The gen-
tleman can’t because he can’t make
the case. He can only put it in his
notes and then come to the mike when
he can’t be questioned and talk about
it. That is the question, and that is the
chord that has been struck.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr.
ARMSTRONG).
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker,
once President Trump was sworn in,
Articles of Impeachment were intro-
duced almost immediately. In 3 years,
House Democrats have introduced 10
resolutions, getting support of over 100
of their Members, and all of that before
the July 25 phone call.
But also during that time, the Russia
conspiracy hoax was exposed. Obstruc-
tion of justice charges were abandoned
after the Mueller hearings fell flat.
So, after 2 years, 19 lawyers, 40
agents, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 warrants,
and 17 lies in a FISA warrant applica-
tion, they had nothing to show for it.
Undeterred by the facts and uninter-
ested in governing, the beat marched
on. So here we are today. We have no
quid pro quo, no bribery, no extortion,
no crimes alleged in the articles at all.
But don’t worry, because we have a
brand-new, 632-page report alleging all
kinds of things, some for the very first
time.
This isn’t a somber, solemn process.
This is a political drive-by. They just
want President Trump gone.
But this never-ending march toward
overturning the 2016 election has con-
sequences, because you are telling 63
million voters that you don’t respect
their vote.
Voters in States like mine, who not
that long ago used to send Democrats
to this august Chamber but, recently,
have found no home in the Democratic
Party, feel that their values have been
replaced by a liberal, elitist agenda and
feel that partisan points are more im-
portant than practical solutions.
Your never-ending impeachment
quest is a constant reminder to them
that you don’t trust their judgment,
you don’t understand their way of life,
and you couldn’t care less about the
issues that are important to them.
As Chairman NADLER has so omi-
nously stated, if you are serious about
removing a President from office, what
you are really doing is overturning the
results of the last election.
Well, they were serious. They spent
the last 3 years talking about it, un-
willing to accept the results of 2016.
I wonder if my colleagues recognize
the irony that their impeachment ven-
detta is the greatest election inter-
ference of all, and it was homegrown
right here in the Halls of Congress.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I re-

Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-

Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, this
impeachment is an embarrassment for
House Democrats.

claim that their case is uncontested,

H12182 December 18, 2019
relying on presumptions, hearsay, and
3 percent of the story trying to connect
dots that actually aren’t connected.
Some inconvenient truths: President
Zelensky didn’t know that there was a
hold on aid until August 29. The aid
gets released shortly thereafter, and
Ukraine didn’t have to do anything in
order to get that aid released; Presi-
dent Zelensky says no demand, no quid
pro quo, no pressure.
But Democrats want the public to ig-
nore the other 97 percent of this story.
It doesn’t work like that.
Senate Democrats want new wit-
nesses to show why there was a hold on
aid. That is an odd request if you think
you have already proven your case.
At the heart of this debate, two in-
vestigations are being discussed be-
tween countries. Democrats and media
allies want the public to believe it is
all just debunked that Ukrainians
interfered in the 2016 election. They
want you to ignore Avakov and Chaly’s
comments, that Chalupa worked with
the Ukrainian Embassy, origins of the
Steele dossier, the black ledger, and
more.
The problem with all of this is that
the American public are smarter than
Democrats are giving them credit for.
Next, the Democrats claim the Re-
publicans are arguing that it was
Ukraine and not Russia that wanted to
interfere and was interfering in the
2016 election. No, that is not what Re-
publicans are saying.
Of course, we have the Burisma-
Biden issue of a corrupt Ukrainian en-
ergy company run by a corrupt Ukrain-
ian oligarch hiring Hunter Biden for at
least $50,000 per month, with no energy
experience and no Ukraine experience,
solely because he is Vice President
Biden’s son.
Now, the company wanted to hire
Hunter Biden because they wanted to
curry favor while there was this ongo-
ing corruption investigation. Enter Joe
Biden. He gets that prosecutor fired,
threatening the loss of $1 billion if it
didn’t happen immediately, which it
was.
Now, Democrats believe that
Burisma and Biden should be immune
from scrutiny. I disagree. Never again
should that conflict of interest ever
happen. And our governments should
be working together to get to the bot-
tom of all of this.
This has also been a total disaster on
the process, from getting a Federal
worker to file a whistleblower com-
plaint to Schiff’s made-up version of
the July 25 call.
In the closed-door interviews, Schiff
was prosecutor, judge, jury, and wit-
ness coach. Every day he loved getting
America drunk on his favorite cock-
tail, three ingredients: cherry-picking
leaks, withholding key facts, and mis-
stating evidence.
In the depositions and in the public
hearings, the President’s counsel was
not invited to attend, present evidence,
or cross-examine witnesses; and Repub-
licans weren’t allowed to call witnesses
like Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, and oth-
ers.
Then there was the House Judiciary
debacle where Schiff couldn’t even
show up to present his reports. He had
to have one of his staffers present it for
him. This impeachment is ripping our
country in half. It is fatally flawed on
the process, the substance, the inten-
tions, and the consequences. It is a
total Schiff show. I encourage all my
colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’
b 1830
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr.
MEADOWS).
Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Speaker,
today, as we sit here debating impeach-
ment, all they want to talk about is
the Constitution and Alexander Ham-
ilton. During the last 30 days I have
heard more about Hamilton from my
Democrat colleagues, and until then
the closest they ever came to Hamilton
was a $10 bill. All of a sudden, what we
have are these strict constitutionalists
on the other side of the aisle.
Madam Speaker, this has nothing to
do with the Constitution. It has noth-
ing to do with anything but raw poli-
tics.
There is only one person on the other
side of the aisle who got seven
Pinocchios for not telling the truth. No
one on this side of the aisle got that
during this impeachment process,
Madam Speaker.
The American people need to under-
stand two key facts: The Democrats in
control set their own rules of evidence.
They said, what we need to do for im-
peachment is to have compelling evi-
dence and bipartisan support.
They don’t have either of those two
things. They failed the rules that they
made up themselves.
We have got President Zelensky of
Ukraine saying that there was no pres-
sure. We have got the number two guy
in Ukraine saying that there was no
pressure. We have got the number
three guy in Ukraine saying that there
was no pressure. These are the sup-
posed victims of this alleged crime, and
yet here we are supposedly having this
compelling evidence and facts when the
best witness they have—the very best
witness they had—had to change his
testimony twice. They mentioned him
611 times, and ultimately, he said: I
presume that that is what the Presi-
dent meant.
Madam Speaker, I can tell you that
there are not facts here to support it.
But what is more important than that,
Madam Speaker, is that here we are
today and we have bipartisan opposi-
tion to impeachment, not bipartisan
support.
My colleagues opposite want the
American people to think that this is a
sad and somber day. This is a sad day.
It is a sad day for this institution be-
cause we have lowered the bar to im-
peach a President who continues to
give us an economy that not only is
growing, but growing at levels that we
have never seen in the history of our
country. When we look at unemploy-
ment at a level that is truly remark-
able, they want to impeach.
But it is another sad day because now
what they are doing is they are telling
the American people that 233 Demo-
crats deserve to decide who the Presi-
dent of the United States should be and
disenfranchise 63 million voters.
When all is said and done, when the
history of this impeachment is written,
it will be said that my Washington
Democrat friends couldn’t bring them-
selves to work with Donald Trump, so
they consoled themselves instead by si-
lencing the will of those who did: the
American people.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. SHERMAN).
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker,
Robert Mueller lays out facts from 2017
that constitute Obstruction of Justice
but says the President cannot be in-
dicted, only Congress can apply the law
to those facts.
Many of us have been talking about
impeachment since those facts
emerged in 2017.
Of course, today, we focus on more
recent crimes.
So why did we talk of impeachment
back when a Republican-led Congress
would not act?
Why do we impeach today when a Re-
publican-led Senate is unlikely to act?
First, because it is our constitutional
duty, no matter what the political con-
sequences.
Second, because it is the most effec-
tive tool to chasten and restrain a
President who does not naturally feel
constrained by the rule of law.
I would note that the President’s at-
tempt to extort Ukraine was secretive
and furtive, far different from his
modus operandi of brazen threats that
we saw in 2017.
We can only imagine what high
crimes and misdemeanors this Presi-
dent would have boldly committed had
nobody been talking about impeach-
ment then—had he felt immune from
impeachment.
Today we will demonstrate that the
President is not above the law.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, it would have been nice if
they had actually thought those crimes
were bad enough to have put them in
the articles, but they didn’t.
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to
the gentleman from Texas (Mr.
RATCLIFF).
Mr. RATCLIFFE. Madam Speaker, do
you know who doesn’t think the Demo-
crats have presented enough testimony
or evidence to impeach President
Trump today?
It is the Democrats.
Sure, here in the House, Democrats
running this inquiry have declared
they have done everything needed and

they have all the testimony and evi-
dence necessary to impeach right now.
But right now, down the hall, Demo-
crats in the Senate are saying the
exact opposite. They are complaining
they need more evidence and more tes-
timony, because Senate Democrats
know that House Democrats have built
them a house-of-cards impeachment,
an impeachment built by the same
Democrats who told America: Trust us,
President Trump committed treason;
he is a Russian agent, and we have got
evidence—which, of course, proved to
be totally false.
To quote the favorite catchphrase of
one Member of this House, they got
caught.
Along the way, those same Demo-
crats said: Trust us, the FISA law and
court weren’t abused by the Obama ad-
ministration using a Democratic oppo-
sition research dossier against the
Trump campaign and President
Trump—again, totally false, and,
again, they got caught.
When Democrats started this latest
impeachment inquiry, they said: Trust
us, we have not yet spoken to the whis-
tleblower.
Again, totally false, and they got
caught.
Sadly, my Democratic colleagues
have placed their own credibility in the
hands of Members of this body who
have no credibility left, Members
whom nobody trusts because they keep
getting caught betraying America.
Unless a bolt of courage and integ-
rity strikes that side of the room in
the next hour, history will reflect that
Donald Trump is the third President to
be impeached. History may also short-
ly reflect that he will be the first
President to be reelected after being
wrongfully impeached.
If that happens, Democrats won’t be
able to hide behind a pretend veneer of
caring about the Constitution. History
will record the Democrats’ legacy as a
betrayal of the Constitution because
the Founders meant for impeachment
to be used for actions so extraordinary
and so rare that it has happened three
times in two and one-half centuries. It
wasn’t meant for congratulatory phone
calls where there is no crime alleged,
where there is no victim, and where the
Democrats themselves couldn’t even
decide what to accuse the President of
doing wrong before ending up with this
embarrassment of a grab bag of an
abuse of power article.
An obstruction of Congress?
To even allege it is an admission of
constitutional illiteracy. The Founders
had a term for what the Democrats call
the obstruction of Congress. The
Founders called it the separation of
powers. The funny thing about obstruc-
tion is every time Democrats get
caught trying to frame this President
for some crime he didn’t commit, they
follow up by accusing him of obstruct-
ing their efforts to frame him for the
things he never did in the first place.
The Founders warned and feared
today might come when impeachment
was used politically by the party that
had the most votes. Today the Demo-
crats are the Founders’ worst night-
mare come true. I think most Ameri-
cans are probably wishing they could
impeach the Democrats.
To them I say: You can next Novem-
ber.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I
think, when the history of this time is
written, it will record that, when my
colleagues found that they lacked the
courage to stand up to this unethical
President, they consoled themselves by
attacking those who did.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. TAKANO)
for a unanimous consent request.
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD my remarks sup-
porting the impeachment of President
Donald Trump.
Madam Speaker, I rise today as a strong
believer in the American experiment and the
democratic norms that distinguish us from the
monarchies that existed at the birth of our na-
tion and from the authoritarian tyrannies that
exist today.
The facts that were uncovered during the
House’s impeachment inquiry point to unlawful
misconduct by President Trump—misconduct
that demands that we, the Congress, hold him
to account.
The president’s egregious abuse of power
undermined the integrity of our elections,
which are the foundation of our democracy,
and threatened our national security.
Furthermore, his refusal to cooperate with
the House’s impeachment inquiry represents
an unprecedented level of contempt for the
law and violation of our democratic norms.
What the president obstructed wasn’t trivial,
nor was it about concealing private conduct—
he obstructed a Congressional investigation of
great significance to our national interest and
infringed on Congress’ ability to carry out our
constitutional duty.
As a separate and co-equal branch of gov-
ernment we must hold the president account-
able for his abuse of power and his violation
of the public trust.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentlewoman from New York
(Ms. CLARKE) for a unanimous consent
request.
(Ms. CLARKE of New York asked and
was given permission to revise and ex-
tend her remarks.)
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam
Speaker, I will include in the RECORD
my remarks supporting my vote for the
impeachment of Donald J. Trump.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentlewoman from California
(Mrs. NAPOLITANO) for a unanimous
consent request.
(Mrs. NAPOLITANO asked and was
given permission to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker,
I include in the RECORD my remarks
supporting the Articles of Impeach-
ment against Donald Trump.
Madam Speaker, I rise to say no one is
above the law, not even the President. Today,
we assert this truth, uphold our constitutional
duty, and hold President Trump accountable
for his actions. To fulfill my oath of office and
protect the Constitution, I will vote to impeach
President Donald Trump.
President Trump abused the power of his
office when he solicited help in the 2020 elec-
tion from Ukraine. He did this not to root out
corruption or with our nation’s interests in
mind, but to gain a personal, political advan-
tage in the election. The President withheld
$391 million in congressionally-approved mili-
tary aid for Ukraine until it agreed to inves-
tigate his political rival. This corrupt scheme
put at risk Ukraine’s security as well as our
own national security, and it undermined the
integrity of our elections. It is a clear abuse of
power.
President Trump then obstructed Congress,
which sought truth and accountability. He or-
dered the complete defiance of lawful sub-
poenas for relevant documents and prohibited
witnesses from giving testimony, further vio-
lating the Constitution. This unprecedented
blockade has threatened our cherished system
of Checks and Balances.
Madam Speaker, it is time to finally hold
President Trump accountable for these corrupt
and unconstitutional actions. We must pass
the two articles of impeachment before us
today to make certain no one is above the
law. I urge all of my colleagues to stand up for
the Constitution and join me in voting yes.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs.
BEATTY) for a unanimous consent re-
quest.

Donald Trump.
Madam Speaker, I rise today—a day that
will certainly be looked back upon by future
generations.
Many years from now, when conspiracy
theories are put aside and the truth made
plain, the American people will know that
President Trump broke his oath, abused the
power of that great office, and thought himself
above the law.
But they will also know that many members
of this body—the People’s House—kept their
oath to defend the Constitution and held Presi-
dent Trump accountable.
History will note each of our names and
where we stood today—for democracy, for jus-
tice, and for this great country.
When we vote to impeach this president this
evening, I can tell you that I will do so with a
clear conscience and with the full confidence
that future generations will judge us on the
right side of history.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms.

H12184 December 18, 2019
I did not come to Congress to impeach the
President, but his actions have left us no
choice.
The facts are uncontested and the truth is
inescapable.
The President leveraged the highest office
in the land for personal political gain. In doing
so, he jeopardized our national security, un-
dermined the integrity of our elections, and be-
trayed the public trust. The Framers gave
Congress the power of impeachment precisely
to protect our democracy from this kind of
abuse of power.
The President’s pattern of misconduct out-
lined in the articles of impeachment, and his
unrepentant contempt for the rule of law,
make it clear that he poses a clear and
present danger to the very foundations of our
democracy.
Voting to impeach the President is not an
easy decision, nor is it one I take any pleasure
in.
I will cast my vote tonight with a heavy heart
and a solemn sense of duty to protect our
Constitution.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from New
Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL).
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, we
are here today because of the failure of
so many to cast aside narrow ambition
to confront the threats standing before
us. Offered the chance to investigate
this government together, the Presi-
dent and his party stonewalled and ob-
structed. We are here today because we
choose comfort over courage and ava-
rice over the Republic.
This is the ongoing tragedy of our
age. And it is ongoing. The matter is
now solely in our hands and belongs to
us and us alone. The buck has stopped.
Many have invoked the judgment of
history as an anecdote to this threat,
but the threat to democracy is here
today, not tomorrow.
We need not and we must not await
the verdict of time for Donald Trump’s
abuse of power and obstruction.
We can offer that verdict right now,
and we are.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN).
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, the
Democrats forgot two key things. They
forgot about the facts, and they forgot
about fairness. Four facts will never
change: We have the call transcript, no
quid pro quo; we have the two guys on
the call who have repeatedly said there
was no pressure and there was no push-
ing; we have the fact Ukraine didn’t
know aid was held up at the time of the
phone call; and, most importantly,
Ukraine took no action and no an-
nouncement of investigation to get the
aid released.
But Democrats don’t care. They
don’t care about the facts, and they
sure don’t care about the process.
There was no subpoena power for Re-
publicans and no Republican witnesses.
During the depositions Republicans
were prevented from getting all their
questions answered, but Democrats got
every one of their questions, the wit-
nesses responded to every one of theirs,
but not Republicans’. The chairman
wouldn’t let them.
Of course, there was the whistle-
blower, the anonymous whistleblower,
with no firsthand knowledge, who was
biased against the President, who
worked for Joe Biden, and who was
never compelled to testify—the guy
who started it all.
This is really about that the Presi-
dent has been driving these guys crazy
because he is getting things done. He is
doing what he said he was going to do.
He is having results. Taxes have been
cut, regulations have been reduced, un-
employment is at its lowest level in 50
years, the economy is growing,
Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are on the
Court, we are out of the Iran deal, the
embassy is in Jerusalem, hostages are
home from North Korea, and a new
NAFTA agreement coming tomorrow.
But guess what, Madam Speaker?
When you drain the swamp, the
swamp fights back. And they started
attacking the President before the
election even. On July 31, 2016, they
opened the Russian investigation. The
FBI spied on four American citizens as-
sociated with the Trump campaign.
The FBI took the dossier to the FISA
court. The dossier they already knew
was false, they took to the court and
lied to the court 17 times.
Guess what, Madam Speaker?
Three days ago on national tele-
vision, even James Comey had to admit
the FBI was wrong. Yesterday—1 day
ago—the FISA court sends the FBI a
letter and says: Straighten up and get
your act together when it comes to the
FISA application process.
Think about this: the attacks started
then, and they have continued right up
until today. But, Madam Speaker, I
want you to think about something:
the individual who said that the FISA
process was fine, the dossier was fine,
and the Russian investigation was fine,
that same individual ran the impeach-
ment process. That same individual’s
staff met with the whistleblower, that
same individual is the only guy in Con-
gress who knows who the whistle-
blower is for sure, and that same indi-
vidual released the phone records of
the President’s personal attorney, re-
leased the phone records of a member
of the press, and released the phone
records of a Republican Member of the
United States Congress.
This process has been unfair, it has
been dangerous, and it has been harm-
ful to our country.
Democrats have never accepted the
will of the American people. NANCY
PELOSI made that clear 4 weeks ago
when she called the President of the
United States an imposter. The will of
we the people, the 63 million folks who
voted for this guy and made him Presi-
dent in an electoral college landslide,
they never accepted that fact.
We are less than 11 months away
from the election. Let the American
people decide who should be President.
Let the American people decide.

Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. SCHNEIDER).
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I
rise to defend the Constitution and
support these Articles of Impeachment.
The President abused the power of
his office by corruptly putting his own
political interest ahead of our Nation’s
security. He blocked congressionally
authorized military aid to coerce
Ukraine to launch a phony investiga-
tion into his political rival.
In the months since, he has waged a
campaign of absolute obstruction
against Congress’ constitutional au-
thority, ordering all Federal officials
to defy subpoenas and refusing to
produce even a single document.
Madam Speaker, I take no joy in to-
day’s impeachment vote or that the
President’s actions demand this re-
sponse. This is a sad moment for our
Nation. Only twice before has the
House voted to impeach a President,
and never before on accusations of
compromising our Nation’s security. I
hope, in the Senate, prosecution and
defense can call and cross-examine wit-
nesses, and the Senators will hear the
evidence and make their decisions
without prejudice or prejudgment.
This is a solemn moment, but our
system of checks and balances was de-
signed for times like these. I have faith
that our Constitution will guide us on
the path ahead.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. NUNES).
Mr. NUNES. Madam Speaker, as the
Democrats now admit, their attempt to
remove the President began on
Trump’s Inauguration Day. When the
Democrats’ semi-official mouthpiece,
The Washington Post, declared: ‘‘The
campaign to impeach President Trump
has begun.’’
For years, the Democrats tried to
expel the President with the prepos-
terous accusation that he was a Rus-
sian agent. As detailed by Inspector
General Horowitz, dishonest intel-
ligence officials used fake allegations
spread by the Democrats to gain ap-
proval of a spying operation against
the Trump campaign.
As they falsely accused the Trump
campaign of colluding with Russians,
the Democrats, themselves, colluded
with Russians to manufacture these al-
legations in the infamous Steele dos-
sier. They even tried to get nude pic-
tures of Trump from Russian prank-
sters.
With the Russian collusion hoax, the
Democrats had everything going for
them: Federal investigations run by
Trump haters; an endless supply of
media cheerleaders; and a galaxy of
leftwing interest groups amplifying
their ridiculous messages.
Yet, even with all those messages at
their disposal, the Russia conspiracy
theory collapsed, so they quickly con-
cocted plan B.
The Ukraine hoax was based on a
supposed whistleblower who colluded

beforehand with the Democrats. The
Democrats then prevented Congress
from interviewing the whistleblower
while conducting bizarre secret deposi-
tions and selectively leaking testi-
mony to discredited media hacks. The
Democrats showcased the most useful
witnesses in public hearings that some-
how reduced support for impeachment.
It is not easy to make a coup at-
tempt boring, but the Democrats found
a way. As it turns out, the American
people don’t think a routine phone call
with a foreign leader is a good basis for
ousting a U.S. President.
The Democrats also put forth ever-
changing accusations against the
President, including campaign finance
violations, quid pro quos, election in-
terference, bribery, and extortion.
Eventually, they ended up with the
ridiculous charges we consider today,
abuse of power, an utterly meaningless
term, and obstruction of Congress. One
Democrat has pronounced the Presi-
dent guilty simply because he won’t co-
operate with their plan to railroad
him.
But the only thing President Trump
is guilty of is beating Hillary Clinton.
The Democrats refuse to accept that
loss, and now they are indicating they
will continue their impeachment ef-
forts even after this one fails in the
U.S. Senate.
Madam Speaker, after all their de-
ceit, phony investigations, ginned-up
crises, and manufactured outrage, the
Democrats need a long period of reha-
bilitation. They must learn how to do
something productive for the American
people instead of ripping the country
apart in their lust for power.
Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman
for his remarks.
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to
the gentleman from Massachusetts
(Mr. NEAL), chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, it is
deeply unfortunate that we have to un-
dertake this impeachment proceeding
that unfolds this evening, but the part
we play in this process is not optional.
Among other things, as the Intel-
ligence Committee and Committee on
the Judiciary have painstakingly docu-
mented, the President has indeed
abused his authority, and he has indeed
obstructed justice.
He threatened to withhold congres-
sionally appropriated U.S. taxpayer
dollars from an ally under attack from
Russia unless they agreed to interfere
in our election on his behalf. He has ex-
pressed no remorse, and he continues
to maintain that his behavior was
‘‘perfect,’’ while simultaneously ob-
structing legitimate congressional
oversight and subpoenas and blocking
members of his administration from
providing truthful testimony to inves-
tigators.
His actions are so far beyond the pale
that they have left us with no remain-
ing recourse except impeachment, and
so we shall impeach because, as drastic
and as unwelcome as this step is, our
country faces even greater long-term
risk if we fail to respond.
We cannot excuse a President who
feels entitled to disregard or break the
law with impunity. We are a nation
built upon the rule of law, not the law
of rulers.
The Framers gave us their best effort
in 1787, and, indeed, it was an extraor-
dinary one. The Constitution they set
down wasn’t perfect, but it founded a
republic that has endured and thrived
with exceptional stability.
As the late Senator Moynihan point-
ed out, only two countries in the world
both existed in 1800 and have never had
their governments changed by violence
since then: the United States and Brit-
ain. Only eight governments have ex-
isted since 1914 and have not had their
form of government changed by force
since then: the United States, the
United Kingdom, Australia, Canada,
New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden,
and Switzerland.
The innovative system of checks and
balances that they constructed, with
the separation of powers, brought
about and successfully negotiated a
generation of challenges that we have
sustained.
In the very first week that the Fram-
ers began crafting this blueprint for
America’s freedom and stability, nego-
tiations immediately started on im-
peachment. No government in the
world at that time exposed the head of
government to impeachment, but
America was to be different.
In the view of the Framers, impeach-
ment is in no way a constitutional cri-
sis. It is a process that the Framers
wisely judged that we would sometimes
need. This evening is one of those rare
moments.
Madison worried that, one day, the
country would elect a President who
‘‘might pervert his administration into
a scheme of peculation or oppression.
He might betray his trust to foreign
powers.’’ George Mason asked the Dele-
gates: ‘‘Shall any man to be above jus-
tice? Above all, shall that man be
above it who can commit the most ex-
tensive injustice?’’
Of course not, because having just
thrown off one King, they would never
consent to anoint another one. Amer-
ica firmly rejected the notion of divine
right.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. NEAL. Article I of the Constitu-
tion prescribes Congress as the first
branch of government. Just as impor-
tantly, let me quote Speaker Rayburn,
who was asked: How many Presidents
did you serve under?
Speaker Rayburn answered: None. I
served with seven Presidents of the
United States.
Impeachment is reserved for mo-
ments of grave danger when the con-
stitutional order becomes dangerously
out of balance, moments like this one.
That is why I will vote to impeach.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 13⁄4 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON).
Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker,
well, here we are, on the verge of doing
exactly what America doesn’t want us
to do and what they feared that you
would do.
In 2016, I, along with 63 million
American voters representing 304 elec-
toral college votes, went to the polls,
and we raised our collective political
middle finger to D.C. and voted for
Donald Trump, folks like my father,
who watched this place destroy his pro-
fession of community banking; my
friends and family in the textile indus-
try who saw their way of life destroyed
following NAFTA; Americans in rural
areas whose opportunity and life and
voice have been drowned out by the
screams of socialist Democrats; our
friends and neighbors living in poverty
and crime, broken-down, project-based
public housing, who for generations
have been told by this place: ‘‘This is
the best that we think you can do. Here
is your check. God bless you. Now,
move along.’’ Those voters.
Now you want to remove our voice
from office. Well, our voice will be
heard. I stand here determined to make
sure that it will be because we will
fight back against this corrupt and un-
fair impeachment process.
How dare you, the liberal elites, the
condescending bureaucrats, and every
other kind of swamp critter in this
godforsaken place tell the American
public who the President should be.
That is the job of the American voter,
not yours.
This whole flipping rodeo is a sham
and a shame, and it will not be forgot-
ten.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. HECK).
Mr. HECK. Madam Speaker, this
week, Americans are busy finishing up
their Christmas shopping mostly for
their children, or if they are lucky
enough to have them, their grand-
children. And high school and college
students are taking final exams and
sweating out the results.
That got me to thinking about those
who follow and what our obligation is
to them, and that got me to thinking
about those who came before and how
they might have seen their obligation
to us, people like my grandfather, who
our family believes literally was born
on the boat on the way over here from
Germany, or my father, who fought in
World War II against the very people
that his grandfather had left.
We are all here today, all of us, be-
cause someone before us sacrificed so
that they could journey here and build
a new life in this unique land. We are
here today because those immigrants
and their children were dedicated not
just to the land of America, but to the
idea: freedom and opportunity secured
by self-government, choosing our own
leaders in free and fair elections, and
the rule of law under the Constitution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H12186 December 18, 2019
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Washington.
Mr. HECK. This idea of America is in
peril, brought about so by this Presi-
dent, who sought to cheat in an elec-
tion, a President who puts himself
above the law and attacks the bedrock
constitutional precept of checks and
balances.
Yet, the question is, can America
survive this behavior? What ideal will
we hand down to those who follow us?
And, finally, what is our obligation to
those who would follow?
It is simply this: to do our duty, to
defend the Constitution and the values
underpinning it by voting ‘‘yes’’ on the
Articles of Impeachment.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS).
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, we
live in the greatest democracy in the
world, and I am convinced that the
overwhelming majority of Americans
are good, decent people who work hard
and play by the rules.
But then, we have people who have
no respect for the law, people who have
little regard for the rules, people who
spend a lot of their time trying to fig-
ure out how to game the system. Law
enforcement officers call them habit-
ual offenders. The more they get away
with, the more likely they are to en-
gage in misconduct.
Some say it takes courage to hold
powerful people accountable, but I see
it differently. I see it as a sense of
duty, a regular part of my job as a
Member of Congress.
However, habitual offenders usually
don’t sneak up on you. They usually
telegraph their intentions time and
time again.
On July 27, 2016, in my home State of
Florida, then-candidate Trump said,
‘‘Russia, if you are listening, I hope
you’re able to find the 30,000 emails,’’
thereby inviting foreign interference
into U.S. elections.
Then, the day after the special coun-
sel testified before Congress, the Presi-
dent, feeling undeterred and
emboldened, called President Zelensky
and pressured him to help him rig the
elections and chose to hold much-need-
ed military aid over our ally’s head
until the President’s demands were
met.
Now, I served 12 years on the hostage
negotiations team, and I know that
pressure and demands come in many
forms. In this scheme, we had both.
I have enforced the laws, and now I
write the laws. But the laws mean
nothing if the accused can destroy evi-
dence, stop witnesses from testifying,
and blatantly refuse to cooperate. I ask
you to name somebody in your commu-
nity or your family who can do that.
I know the President said that he can
get away with anything he wants to. I
come today to tell you that, no, he
cannot, because no one is above the
law, and he shall be held accountable.

Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from
Arkansas (Mr. CRAWFORD) for a unani-
mous consent request.
(Mr. CRAWFORD asked and was
given permission to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I
include in the RECORD my remarks in
opposition to this sham impeachment.
Madam Speaker, the talking points that we
have heard all day are the same that have
been repeated for months—and they all point
to the same conclusions: the President did not
abuse his power and he has been subjected
to the most partisan, lopsided impeachment
attempt in history.
President Trump said there was no quid pro
quo. President Zelensky said there was no
quid pro quo. The two people with any direct
knowledge both said that there was no crime.
Despite that, one of my colleagues—the same
one who publicly claimed for over a year that
he had seen clear evidence that the President
was a Russian spy—secretly met with a whis-
tleblower who had heard that the President
had withheld aid for a quid pro quo. Now, we
don’t know if that knowledge came to the
whistleblower second, third, or even fourth
hand because we weren’t allowed to question
them—we just know it was hearsay.
What is readily apparent after years of this
garbage is that the Democrat party simply
cannot accept the will of the American people.
Robert Mueller investigated the Russian collu-
sion hoax for over a year and cleared that
cluster of lies with his report. Rather than in-
demnify President Trump for promoting and
campaigning on that sham, my colleagues
across the aisle cooked up another scandal to
deliver on their impeachment promises.
In 2024 there will be no Soviet-bloc coun-
tries left to accuse the President of colluding
with and then what will you do?
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY).
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today on the floor of this magnificent
Chamber, the very heart of our demo-
cratic Republic, and I would imagine,
Madam Speaker, that every one of us
in this Chamber, regardless of party,
understands, shares a common view,
that being citizens of this great Repub-
lic is among life’s most tremendous
blessings.
We all know that no force on Earth is
more powerful than the force of free-
dom. It is our miraculous constitu-
tional system, Madam Speaker, de-
fended by our men and women in uni-
form that has safeguarded that free-
dom for 230 years.
Each one of us in this Chamber bears
a sacred duty, passed down to us
through generations and affirmed in
our oath of office, to preserve and pro-
tect our Constitution.
Madam Speaker, our Nation’s Fram-
ers recognized that this Republic is
fragile and that extreme partisanship
can be among the most severe threats
to its survival. That is why, in Fed-
eralist 65, Alexander Hamilton wrote:
‘‘. . . there will always be the greatest
danger that the decision will be regu-
lated more by the comparative
strength of parties, than by the real
demonstrations of innocence or guilt.’’
Madam Speaker, our Democratic col-
leagues have been working to remove
this President since the day he was
elected, searching for an offense on
which they could impeach. Failing to
find one, Madam Speaker, they have
decided to assume one.
Rather than attempting to enforce
their subpoenas in court, they have
also decided to declare it a high crime
and misdemeanor when the President
of the United States asserts his con-
stitutional privileges.
The Democrats are asking Members
of this body to impeach, despite the
fact that they have presented no direct
evidence of any impeachable offense.
Let me say it one more time, Madam
Speaker. They have presented no direct
evidence of any impeachable offense.
If anyone in this Chamber still be-
lieves the Democrats have proven their
case, I would urge those Members to
ask the chairman of the Intelligence
Committee, Mr. SCHIFF, why he failed
to appear to answer questions about
his report. Before Members vote for im-
peachment, they might want to know
why the author of the impeachment re-
port will not defend it under ques-
tioning.
If the House impeaches here, Madam
Speaker, it will create exactly the type
of risk the Framers cautioned us to
avoid: It will mean that divided gov-
ernment can imperil a democratically
elected President based on unproven al-
legations and innuendo in the absence
of direct testimony.
Despite all the rhetoric you have
heard today, Madam Speaker, passage
of these Articles of Impeachment may
permanently damage our Republic.
From this day forward, a hyperpartisan
bare majority can cite this precedent
to try to remove a future Commander
in Chief.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to
think of our Republic, think of the
Constitution, think of the oath that we
all swore to protect and defend that
Constitution, and vote against these
partisan, reckless, and dangerous Arti-
cles of Impeachment.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. LEVIN).
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam
Speaker, today we proclaim that no
person is above the law, not even the
President of the United States.
Donald J. Trump abused the power of
his office and violated his oath of office
by extorting a new and inexperienced
President of a vulnerable foreign ally
to dig up dirt on Mr. Trump’s domestic
political opponents.
He then obstructed the Congress, this
equal branch of our government, from
undertaking our duty, outlined in the
Constitution itself, to investigate and
check these violations.
Today, we do nothing more and noth-
ing less than fulfill our duty to our
country and to our Constitution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H12187
December 18, 2019
Mr. Trump has allowed foreign pow-
ers to interfere in our domestic affairs.
He has endangered our national secu-
rity and our democracy itself. Madam
Speaker, for those reasons, we must
impeach this President.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from
Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) for a unanimous
consent request.
(Mr. WALDEN asked and was given
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I op-
pose this resolution on impeachment,
and I include my statement in the
RECORD.
Madam Speaker, President Donald Trump is
unique in the history of the American presi-
dency. No one has led as he has. His success
and his style have frustrated his opponents.
Remember back to the fall of 2016 when
pundits and politicians on the left lectured
Americans about the historical need to accept
the outcome of the election? Then Hilary Clin-
ton lost. Some began undermining and attack-
ing the President before he had even taken of-
fice. Others called for his impeachment.
Meanwhile, we now know—as a result of
the Horowitz investigation—that some in the
FBI engaged in nefarious actions to inves-
tigate the Trump campaign. They lied to and
misled the FISA court in an incredible abuse
of power by a government agency. Civil lib-
ertarians are rightly outraged by what oc-
curred. Laws designed to protect America
from foreign terrorists were misused to spy on
an American presidential campaign.
The false narrative of the Trump campaign
colluding with the Russians dominated the first
two years of the Trump presidency. I sup-
ported the appointment of Mr. Mueller and re-
peatedly stood up for the independence of his
investigation. I wanted the facts.
The Mueller investigation spent years and
millions of taxpayer dollars and came up
empty. That report produced nothing impeach-
able, or the articles of impeachment would in-
clude the findings of that report.
For me, overturning the outcome of an elec-
tion demands two things: A bipartisan and fair
process to determine wrong doing, and a
criminal offense worthy of overturning the out-
come of the voters’ will. Neither threshold has
been met in this case.
With a clear conscience, I will vote against
both articles of impeachment.
Read the articles of impeachment. ‘‘Abuse
of power’’ and ‘‘obstruction of Congress,’’ are
the charges. Neither of these are criminal vio-
lations. This isn’t perjury or burglary.
Every administration—Democratic and Re-
publican—pushes back against Congress’ re-
quest for witnesses and information. The Con-
stitution enshrines this separate-branch con-
flict. Congress doesn’t like being told no. At
times we’ve sued over it. It’s the tension our
founders designed into the competing
branches of government. Work it out, or go to
the courts. But in this case, they truncated the
timeline to exclude a judicial review. They an-
nounced the outcome before the investigation
was completed.
I voted to hold President Obama’s Attorney
General in contempt of Congress for refusing
to turn over documents related to the ‘‘fast
and furious’’ fiasco. Congress sued and won
this case. But Republicans never seriously
thought about impeaching the President.
I threatened to subpoena President Trump’s
Attorney General Jeff Sessions to his face in
the East Room of the White House during our
investigation of the opioid crisis. We eventually
worked it out and got to review the data we
sought. Not once did I think about impeaching
the President over this matter.
The anti-Trump crowd has weaponized im-
peachment and converted it into a partisan
tool, something one of America’s founding fa-
thers—Alexander Hamilton—warned against.
The American people elected President Trump
to shake things up in Washington, D.C. And
that’s precisely what he’s done.
Lower taxes and less oppressive regulations
would not have happened under a Clinton Ad-
ministration. Hillary Clinton would not have
stood up to China as President Trump has.
She would not have demanded and gotten a
new and better trade deal with our friends to
the north and south. As for the Russians,
she’s the one who led the ‘‘reset’’ with Russia
that offended our European allies and played
into Putin’s hand.
We’ve never had a better economy or lower
unemployment in the modern era. We’re the
envy of the world. America is standing up to
our competitors and enemies. We’re getting
new and better trade agreements and bringing
more jobs back to America.
We’ve never had a President lean in more
to get lower drug prices or make our allies
keep their promises to help pay for their na-
tional security.
President Trump is doing exactly what he
promised, and that includes violating the polit-
ical norms of the Washington, D.C. swamp.
And for that, the left wants to send him pack-
ing.
In facts matter, we should not impeach this
president, but instead get back to work solving
the problems facing American families.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN) for a
unanimous consent request.
(Mr. NORMAN asked and was given
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I op-
pose this resolution, and I include my
statement in the RECORD.
Madam Speaker, Today I have heard my
Democratic warn that our Republic is in a con-
stitutional crisis. Yet the only crisis I see is the
crisis of one party unable to accept its defeat.
When you lost, you called for the abolish-
ment of the Electoral College, to redraw the
electoral map, and now for impeachment
You claim to be the Defenders of our Con-
stitution, but is there any article you would not
shred to gain power?
But if we pretend for a second that you are
sincere about the dangers to our Republic, I
am left wondering:
Why would you not follow the historical
precedent of impeachment processes?
Why would you not have an open and fair
investigation?
Why would you rush through the entire
process?
In other words, if you are so concerned with
the fate of our Republic, why on earth would
you play politics with it?
The truth is, yours words do not match your
actions.
As you pretend to cry about the state of our
Republic, save a few tears for the state of
your own party.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from
Mississippi (Mr. PALAZZO) for a unani-
mous consent request.
(Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I op-
pose the Articles of Impeachment, and
I include my statement in the RECORD.
Madam Speaker, as the Democrats con-
tinue suppressing Republicans’ right to speak
out against the ridiculous impeachment in-
quiry, I was unable to provide remarks during
the debate in the House on the two articles of
impeachment today. I now ask my colleagues
on the other side of the aisle why they chose
to silence not only members of Congress but
also our constituents. The responsibility of im-
peachment is not one I take lightly. I am dis-
appointed the Democrats continued ramming
this baseless impeachment through the House
without hearing from every single member of
Congress. Had I been provided the oppor-
tunity to speak before the House, I would have
shared the following thoughts.
I rise with a heavy heart for our nation
today.
Later this evening, House Democrats will
force a vote on the weakest articles of im-
peachment this legislative body has ever seen
in an attempt to overturn the fair and lawful
election of Donald Trump.
Since the day President Trump was inaugu-
rated, Democrats have made it their sole pur-
pose to impeach this man, but for what? No
facts have been presented to substantiate a
single allegation made by the liberal majority.
Simply put Mr. Speaker, the Democrats in
Congress do not care about free and fair elec-
tions. They do not care about the will of the
American people. They care about obstructing
the work of a great American president with
whom they disagree.
The articles of impeachment before the
House today, fall significantly short of an im-
peachable offense. This vote sets a horrible
precedent that any majority can undo an elec-
tion based on personality conflicts and policy
disagreements.
The Democrats have entirely disregarded
process and procedure by blatantly ignoring
the notion that all are innocent until proven
guilty—the president is not guilty of obstruction
of Congress, and he is not guilty of an abuse
of power.
The president making efforts to curb corrup-
tion in a country well known for corruption is
not quid pro quo; it is good governance by a
chief executive dedicated to doing right by the
people of this country.
Make no mistake about it, when the work of
this House is done, and the Senate votes to
dismiss these charges, the other party will
continue to obstruct and slander the president
at every turn.
My constituents and I agree that the presi-
dent is changing the face of America for the
better. While some on the other side may not
like his straight-forward manner, it is hard to
argue that our country is not better because of
him.
The Democrats have forgone due process
in an attempt to fulfill their electoral short-
comings.
When my colleagues on the other side of
the aisle want to find reasons why they lost in
2016, they should not look beyond the con-
fines of their own caucus.

H12188 December 18, 2019
I encourage my colleagues to give up this
charade, get back to leading, and move past
personal vendettas against a duly elected
president.
The majority party could take some lessons
from our president. Let’s put Americans first
and get back to taking care of our country.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I would ask the gentleman if
he is ready to close.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I have
a few more speakers.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. ESPAILLAT).
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, if
you live on Lenox Avenue in the vil-
lage of Harlem in my district, you are
not above the law.
If you live on Webster Avenue in the
Bronx part of my district, you are not
above the law.
If you live in Washington Heights,
the immigrant neighborhood in my dis-
trict, you are not above the law.
So I submit to you, if you live at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue, you are not
above the law, and you will be held ac-
countable.
President Donald Trump asked the
Ukrainian President to ‘‘do us a favor’’
and look into the Bidens. That is abuse
of power.
President Trump used the official
White House meeting to extort the
Ukrainian President. That is abuse of
power.
President Trump ordered White
House staff to withhold $400 million in
aid to Ukraine. That is abuse of power.
President Trump and his staff defied
multiple subpoenas from Congress.
That is obstruction of Congress.
He blocked witnesses from testifying
before this body. That is obstruction of
Congress.
No one is above the law. I cast my
vote for these Articles of Impeach-
ment, and I ask my colleagues to do
the same.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from
Virginia (Mr. WITTMAN) for a unani-
mous consent request.
(Mr. WITTMAN asked and was given
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude my statement in the RECORD, re-
cording that I am opposed to these Ar-
ticles of Impeachment on the basis
that they do not measure up to Article
II, Section 4.
Madam Speaker, following the release of re-
ports from the Oversight, Intelligence, Foreign
Affairs, and Judiciary Committees, it is clear
the hearings held by House Democrats over
the last month have by no means proved
President Trump committed an impeachable
offense. Unhappy with the results of the elec-
tion, House Democrats have been working to
build a case for impeachment since the day
President Trump took office. Speaker PELOSI
said from the beginning that the impeachment
must be ‘compelling, overwhelming, and bipar-
tisan;’ and today, none of those are true. In
actuality, there is one thing bipartisan about
this impeachment: the opposition to it.
There is a reason why only three presidents
have gone through this before—it is supposed
to be an exceedingly rare occurrence. The
founders warned against a single party im-
peachment because it would divide the coun-
try—and that is what we are seeing right now,
we are seeing Democrats weaponize the im-
peachment process and I am worried for the
precedent this will set for the future.
The majority has wasted the Fall by being
solely focused on impeachment—leading us to
pass two continuing resolutions, miss impor-
tant deadlines for the NDAA, and leave fund-
ing to the last minute. I believe we need to be
focused on solving problems and working on
solutions for our constituents; the American
people are sick of this partisan stalemate. I
hope in the beginning of the next session we
can get back to the real issues—finding a bi-
partisan solution to lowering the price of pre-
scription drugs, creating an infrastructure
package, reforming our broken budget proc-
ess, and expanding access to broadband in
rural areas.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. BROWNLEY ).
Ms. BROWNLEY of California.
Madam Speaker, as the chair of the
Women’s Veterans Task Force, I see,
every single day, the immense sacrifice
our women veterans and all of our Na-
tion’s veterans have made in service to
our country, in service to our Com-
mander in Chief, our Constitution, to
protect our democracy, and for every
single man, woman, and child in our
country.
When the President of the United
States used $400 million meant to pro-
tect our national security in order to
cheat in our elections, he not only
abused his power, he turned his back
on the sacrifices our veterans and their
families have made for all that we hold
so dear. That abuse of power is rep-
rehensible, and it is exactly what im-
peachment was designed to prevent.
We have a solemn duty to protect our
Constitution, to protect our democ-
racy, and to honor all those who have
laid their lives on the line for these
United States of America.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman
from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI) for a
unanimous consent request.
(Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was
given permission to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I
will include in the RECORD my opposi-
tion to these Articles of Impeachment.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
30 seconds to the gentlewoman from
California (Mrs. DAVIS).
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam
Speaker, make no mistake. We are not
impeaching this President. He is im-
peaching himself.
If you are the President and you ob-
struct justice, try to bribe a foreign
leader, and threaten national security,
you are going to get impeached. End of
story.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) for a unani-
mous consent request.
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I include
in the RECORD my opposition to these
Articles of Impeachment.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentlewoman from New
Mexico (Ms. HAALAND).
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Speaker, I
stand before you as a Representative of
New Mexico, a place where we believe
in dignity and respect for all. In Con-
gress, I have been fighting for them.
We have been working to make
healthcare more affordable, education
accessible, and move our country for-
ward for the people.
But today, this President has forced
us into a serious debate. We are talking
about a President who used the power
of the Presidency for his own political
gain, risking our national security, and
putting the integrity of the next elec-
tion at risk.
It is a sad day when a President
shows complete disrespect for Congress
as a coequal branch of government and
for the American people who elected
us.
We collected the evidence, and the
facts are indisputable. We all took an
oath to protect and defend our Con-
stitution. We have the solemn responsi-
bility to hold this President account-
able because it is our job.
I urge my colleagues to live up to our
responsibility and show our fellow
Americans that no one, not even the
President, is above the law.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from
Oklahoma (Mr. MULLIN) for a unani-
mous consent request.
(Mr. MULLIN asked and was given
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MULLIN. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD my opposition to
these Articles of Impeachment.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentlewoman from North Caro-
lina (Ms. ADAMS) for a unanimous con-
sent request.
(Ms. ADAMS asked and was given
permission to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD my statement in
support of the Articles of Impeachment
against President Donald J. Trump.
After reviewing hours of testimony, count-
less pieces of evidence, and the Administra-
tion’s own words and actions, I believe the
case has been made that the President
abused his power and obstructed Congress
from fulfilling its constitutional duty.
As such, I will support both articles of im-
peachment today on the House floor.
The evidence shows that the President put
his interests above those of the country.
We must act quickly because President
Trump’s behavior poses a clear and present
danger to our democracy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H12189
December 18, 2019
His words and actions show that he is ac-
tively looking to interfere in next year’s elec-
tion by any means necessary.
We cannot stand for that kind of misconduct
in our country’s Chief Executive.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE),
the minority whip.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, im-
peaching a President of the United
States. This isn’t about some solemn
duty tonight. Let’s talk about what
this is really about.
This has been about a political ven-
detta, a political vendetta that didn’t
just start with the Zelensky call. It
started long before that.
Just listen to some of the quotes
from Democrats in this Chamber:
Speaker PELOSI: It’s been going on
for 22 months, 21⁄2 years, actually. We
cannot accept a second term for Donald
Trump. What’s more serious is that he
can’t win.
This isn’t about some crime that was
committed. It is about fear that he
might win reelection.
That is not why you impeach a Presi-
dent.
b 1915
AL GREEN: ‘‘I’m concerned that if we
don’t impeach this President, he will
get reelected.’’
The list goes on, Madam Speaker. In
fact, there are some quotes that I can’t
even read on this House floor that
some of our colleagues made.
And keep in mind, more than 100
Democrats on this House floor voted to
impeach this President before the
Zelensky phone call.
Just look at some of these Articles of
Impeachment they voted for 2 years
ago:
Fifty-eight Democrats voted to im-
peach the President over comments he
made about NFL players kneeling for
the Pledge of Allegiance. Over 50
Democrats voted to impeach him for
that.
Just this summer, over 90 Democrats
voted to impeach the President for
comments he made about The Squad.
So he makes comments about some
other Members of Congress who make a
lot of comments about him, and 95
Members vote to impeach the Presi-
dent of the United States.
This is a political vendetta. It has
nothing to do with a crime committed.
There was no crime.
And why don’t we listen to some of
the witnesses? Obviously, we weren’t
able to call all the witnesses we want-
ed, but there were witnesses. In fact,
Gordon Sondland, U.S. Ambassador to
the European Union, he is mentioned
over 600 times in the Schiff report. He
was their star witness.
And what did he say when asked:
‘‘Did President Trump ever tell you
personally about any preconditions for
anything?’’
His answer: ‘‘No.’’
‘‘Any preconditions for the aid to be
released?’’
‘‘No.’’
‘‘Any preconditions for a White
House meeting?’’
Under oath, he testified: ‘‘No.’’
Abuse of power, let’s talk about that
Article of Impeachment, Madam
Speaker.
George Washington Law Professor
Turley, who admitted under oath that
he voted against Donald Trump, spoke
to this claim of abuse of power. In fact,
he said: ‘‘If you make a high crime and
misdemeanor out of going to the
courts, it is an abuse of power; it is
your abuse of power.’’
You are doing precisely what you are
criticizing the President of doing,
abuse of power.
There is a House rule, Madam Speak-
er, that requires—not allows, but re-
quires—that the minority get a day of
hearing, which we asked for multiple
times. They broke this rule. They
didn’t allow us to have a minority day
of hearing. They didn’t want to hear
the facts about this case because it was
never about the facts because there
was no crime. It is about a personal po-
litical vendetta.
Now let’s talk about obstruction of
Congress, as they make up these terms
to impeach a President because they
didn’t find a crime, and they were look-
ing. It has been an impeachment in
search of a crime.
But they talk about obstruction of
Congress in saying the President defied
subpoenas, subpoena after subpoena.
Let’s go through the Departments.
The Department of State they sub-
poenaed. Do you know that, literally,
just 4 days after the subpoena, the Sec-
retary of State, himself, responded to
their subpoena?
The Department of Defense, a week
later responded to the subpoena.
The Department of Energy responded
to the subpoena.
We can go on and on with all of these
agencies.
That is an abuse of power, that is an
obstruction of Congress, responding to
your subpoena?
That is what they did: They re-
sponded.
You might not have liked the answer,
but that is not the way this works. You
don’t impeach a President because you
don’t like his foreign policy, as so
many of those foreign policy experts
came and testified.
But this isn’t just about Donald
Trump. They don’t just hate Donald
Trump, Madam Speaker. They hate the
63 million Americans who voted for
this President, the forgotten men and
women of this country who have been
left behind, Madam Speaker. Madam
Speaker, it is those forgotten men and
women of this country that Wash-
ington had left behind.
And what is this President doing for
them? He is delivering for them: 600
jobs in Pennsylvania; 1,000 jobs, work-
ers in Mingo Junction, Ohio; $750 mil-
lion investment for 600 new jobs across
this country; The Detroit News; Chrys-
ler, 6,500 new jobs. That is what this
President is doing to deliver for those
men and women of this country who
have been left behind.
It is about time somebody stands up
for Americans, and President Trump is.
So it is a political vendetta.
But if they are going to go through
with this, Madam Speaker, impeach-
ment will not just be a stain on this
Democrat majority; the impeachment
will be their legacy.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentlewoman from New Hamp-
shire (Ms. KUSTER) for a unanimous
consent request.
(Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire
asked and was given permission to re-
vise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire.
Madam Speaker, I include my state-
ment in the RECORD regarding the 75th
anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge
in favor of the Articles of Impeach-
ment.
Madam Speaker, earlier this week, I re-
turned from a bipartisan trip to Belgium to
commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Bat-
tle of the Bulge—the Germans’ last significant
offensive during World War II.
We celebrated with courageous 95-year-old
American veterans who turned the tide at Bas-
togne and the Ardennes Forest, so that my
generation and generations to come may live
in peace and freedom from tyranny.
My late father, Malcolm McLane, was shot
down during the Battle of the Bulge and spent
the final six months of World War II in a Nazi
prisoner-of-war camp.
In this solemn moment, on this historic day
for our nation, I reflect on the legacy of my fa-
ther and all World War II veterans. We owe
them—and all of the men and women who
have served our nation—an incredible debt of
gratitude for their service and bravery.
Today, we must defend a future worthy of
their sacrifice.
Just moments ago, I upheld my oath to pro-
tect and defend the Constitution when I cast
my vote to charge President Donald John
Trump with articles of impeachment.
I did so with a heavy heart, to protect and
defend the future of our great nation—our
American democracy—for generations to
come.
The evidence and facts are clear and
uncontested: President Trump has abused the
power of the Presidency for his own personal
gain, at the expense of our national security
and the integrity of the 2020 election.
Articles of impeachment are formal charges
against the President—this is not a vote to re-
move him from office. That decision will be
made following a trial in the United States
Senate.
I hope that the Senate will hold a fair, trans-
parent and thorough trial to get to the truth for
the American people.
Meanwhile, I will continue to focus my ef-
forts on our important work to improve the
lives of Granite Staters and all Americans. I
wish you and your family a Merry Christmas,
joyful holidays and peace in the New Year.
May God bless the United States of America.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the majority leader
of the House of Representatives.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H12190 December 18, 2019
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I have had the
honor of serving in this House for over
38 years. I have served during six Presi-
dencies. I have been here through mo-
ments of tremendous progress and ter-
rible tragedy. I have seen periods of
rank partnership and patriotic biparti-
sanship. I have seen our two-party sys-
tem work, and I have seen it break
down.
Never in all my years of serving in
this great institution that I love and
the people of my district did I ever ex-
pect to encounter such an obvious
wrongdoing by a President of the
United States, nor did I expect to wit-
ness such a craven rationalization of
Presidential actions which have put
our national security at risk, under-
mined the integrity of our elections,
and defined the constitutional author-
ity of the Congress to conduct over-
sight.
We have heard from Republicans that
this impeachment really has to do with
policy differences or how we feel per-
sonally about the President, about his
temperament or that we simply dislike
him.
Throughout the Trump Presidency,
Democrats have resisted pursuing im-
peachment even as we watched with
dismay and disgust at a pattern of
wrongdoing. That pattern included:
Ordering Federal agencies to lie to
the public;
Firing the FBI Director for refusing
to end investigations of his campaign;
Siding with Vladimir Putin against
our intelligence agencies;
Taking funding away from the mili-
tary to put towards an ineffective bor-
der wall; and
Setting policies that have led to the
separation of families and caging of
children.
We have, to be sure, deep disagree-
ments with the policies and actions
taken by this President.
There has been a lot of talk about
the 63 million people who voted for Mr.
Trump, little talk about the 65 million
people who voted for Hillary Clinton.
The policy difference, or those votes,
this President was elected legitimately
because we have an electoral college.
But none of these are reasons to pursue
what Chairman SCHIFF has called a
wrenching process for the Nation.
In fact, Democrats rejected that
process emphatically in three specific
votes:
In December of 2017, Democrats over-
whelmingly voted against pursuing Ar-
ticles of Impeachment, including the
Speaker and me.
We did so again in 2018, with over 60
percent of the Democrats rejecting pur-
suing Articles of Impeachment.
And again just months ago, in July of
2019, 60 percent of the Democrats said
no to pursuing Articles of Impeach-
ment just days before the infamous
July 25 telephone call. We did the same
with 60 percent of Democrats voting
not to proceed.
Credible witnesses, many of whom
were appointed to office by President
Trump, have corroborated the details
and timeline of his abuse of Presi-
dential power, which forms the basis of
the first Article of Impeachment in
this resolution. I will not recount all of
the witnesses or abuses that have oc-
curred.
I congratulate my colleagues and Mr.
NADLER and his committee and Mr.
SCHIFF and his committee for setting
forth a compelling case. They have
been laid out fully in the articles be-
fore us and by colleagues in their re-
marks.
What I will do is remind Americans
that the House provided President
Trump every opportunity to prove his
innocence, but the witnesses were pre-
cluded from coming forth.
The witnesses who had personal
knowledge did not come, either at the
President’s request, in which he re-
fused to show up because he thought it
was a sham, as so many of you have
said, or to the committees. Instead, he
ignored congressional subpoenas for
documents and for testimony by White
House officials and ordered his subordi-
nates not to cooperate. Perhaps they
could have exonerated him.
This, itself, I suggest to you, is un-
precedented. When Presidents Nixon
and Clinton were asked to hand over
documents and allow officials to tes-
tify, ultimately, both complied because
it is the law.
Such actions of the President can be
taken as further evidence of his ob-
struction and abuse of power. It is, in
and of itself, impeachable conduct, the
subject of the second Article of Im-
peachment.
These two articles, of course, concern
two very profound constitutional
issues about the abuse of power in our
Republic:
First, whether it is acceptable for the
President of the United States—any
President—to solicit foreign inter-
ference in our elections.
There is a difference as to whether he
has done that, and the place to try that
is in the United States Senate. But we
believe strongly there is probable cause
to conclude that, to undermine our na-
tional security, the integrity of our
elections, and the integrity of our de-
mocracy.
Secondly, whether it is permissible
for the President to obstruct Congress
and act as if he is above the law and
immune from constitutional oversight.
On December 4, the Judiciary Com-
mittee heard the testimony of con-
stitutional law experts who weighed in
on these points.
Some 1,500 historians have said the
same thing as Professor Noah Feldman
said: If we cannot impeach a President
who abuses his office for personal ad-
vantage, we no longer live in a democ-
racy. ‘‘We live in a monarchy or we live
under a dictatorship.’’
The votes we are about to take con-
cern the rule of law and our democracy
itself.
Let us not forget the words of John
Locke, so influential to the Founders
of our Republic. John Locke, a mil-
lennia ago, said this: ‘‘Wherever law
ends, tyranny begins.’’
b 1930
This impeachment asks whether we
are still a republic of laws, as our
Founders intended, or whether we will
accept that one person can be above
the law.
In America, as we have said over and
over again, no one is above the law, but
only as long as we hold every person
accountable for breaking the law, even
a President, will that be true.
If the House does not act, if we wait
and delay, we run the risk of allowing
the President’s misconduct, if we be-
lieve it to be so, to be repeated at the
expense of the integrity of our elec-
tions, our national security, and our
constitutional system of separation of
powers.
Democrats did not choose this im-
peachment. We did not wish for it.
We voted against it. We voted against
it once, we voted against it twice, we
voted against it three times, as re-
cently as July.
We did not want this.
However, President Trump’s mis-
conduct has forced our constitutional
Republic to protect itself.
These votes that we are about to
take and the process that will follow in
the Senate are not only an assessment
of the President’s commitment to the
Constitution or to his oath of office; it
is, as well, a test of our own.
Damning evidence of the President’s
high crimes has emerged.
Nevertheless, Republican Members of
this House and of the Senate have con-
tinued to defend the President, whose
actions seem to many of us to be inde-
fensible.
All of us feel a sense of loyalty to
party. It is what makes our two-party
system function. It is what helps hold
Presidents and majorities accountable.
But party loyalty must have its limits.
And as evidence of the President’s
impeachable offenses have mounted
daily as the witnesses testified, it has
become increasingly clear that the lim-
its of partisanship have been reached
and passed.
Now, Democrats and Republicans to-
gether face a test before our constitu-
ents, our countrymen, and our creator.
The New York Times on October 18
summarized the question now posed to
House and Senate, Republicans and
Democrats: ‘‘Compromise by com-
promise, Donald Trump has hammered
away at what Republicans once saw as
foundational virtues: decency, honesty,
responsibility,’’ and, yes, even civility.
It went on to say: ‘‘Will they commit
themselves and their party wholly to
Mr. Trump, embracing even his most
antidemocratic actions, or will they
take the first step toward separating
themselves from him and restoring
confidence in the rule of law?’’
Madam Speaker, we have seen Repub-
lican courage throughout our history,
from the Civil War to the Cold War.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H12191
December 18, 2019
In 1950, Margaret Chase Smith, the
Senator from Maine, a Republican,
spoke bravely against the cancer of
McCarthyism in her party, leading six
of her Republican colleagues in a ‘‘Dec-
laration of Conscience’’ against their
own leadership.
‘‘We are Republicans,’’ they declared.
‘‘But we are Americans first.’’
In 1974, one Congressman took the
brave and principled step of becoming
the first Republican on the Judiciary
Committee to support impeaching
President Nixon.
He said to his colleagues and to the
country: ‘‘It is not easy to align myself
against the President, to whom I gave
my enthusiastic support . . . on whose
side I have stood in many a legislative
battle, whose accomplishments in for-
eign and domestic affairs I have con-
sistently applauded.
‘‘But it is impossible,’’ he went on to
say, ‘‘for me to condone or ignore the
long train of abuses to which he has
subjected the Presidency and the peo-
ple of this country. The Constitution
and my own oath of office,’’ he said,
‘‘demand that I ‘bear true faith and al-
legiance’ to the principles of law and
justice upon which this Nation was
founded,’’ he concluded, ‘‘and I cannot,
in good conscience, turn away from the
evidence of evil that is to me so clear
and compelling.’’
My colleagues, that Congressman’s
name was Larry Hogan, Sr. He rep-
resented the Fifth District of Mary-
land, which I now represent. His son is
presently the second-term Republican
Governor of our State.
When Larry Hogan, Sr., died in 2017,
every obituary led with praise for his
act of political courage.
Who among us, many years from
now, will receive such praise as a man
or woman of courage?
Who will regret not having earned it?
We have talked a lot about partisan
differences.
There is one person who has spoken
today who is neither a member of the
Republican Party nor the Democratic
Party. His name is JUSTIN AMASH, who
represents a Republican district. He
left the Republican Party, and in doing
so, he admonished his colleagues that:
‘‘This President will only be in power
for a short time, but excusing his be-
havior will forever tarnish your name.’’
He spoke on this floor in support of
the two articles that we will consider
this evening, neither a Democrat nor a
Republican.
Representative AMASH, of course, is
the only Member of this House who has
no allegiance to either party, but to his
country. He is supporting, as I have
said, both articles.
We need not ask who will be the first
to show courage by standing up to
President Trump.
The question we must now ask is:
Who will be the last to find it?
The pages of our history are filled
with Americans who had the courage
to choose country over party or person-
ality, but as President Kennedy wrote:
‘‘The stories of past courage . . . can
teach, they can offer hope, they can
provide inspiration. But they cannot
supply courage itself. For this,’’ Presi-
dent Kennedy said, ‘‘each man’’—each
woman—‘‘must look into their own
soul.’’
Madam Speaker, I urge my fellow
colleagues in the House and, yes, in the
Senate, to look into your soul, sum-
mon the courage to vote for our Con-
stitution and our democracy.
I understand we will all not see the
same conclusion, but to do less betrays
our oath and that of our Founders, who
pledged their lives, their fortune, and
their sacred honor.
Let us neither turn away from the
evidence, which to me seems so clear,
nor from our good conscience, which
compels us to do what, in our hearts,
we know to be right.
Let us not allow the rule of law to
end or for tyranny to find its toehold.
With our votes today, we can bear
true faith and allegiance to the vision
of our Founders and we can show fu-
ture generations what it truly means
to be Americans first.
Vote ‘‘yes.’’
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, a few weeks ago just off of
this floor, I said that a dark cloud was
descending upon this body. And today,
because of the clock and the calendar,
it is closing.
It is amazing to me what I just heard
from the majority leader: that Mr.
SCHIFF and Mr. NADLER presented a
compelling case for impeachment.
If this is a compelling case for im-
peachment, I am not sure why we are
here right now.
It is not anywhere close to compel-
ling.
But you know what is interesting is
what I have heard today. The majority
leader just spoke and said that the
President was given every opportunity
to come prove his innocence.
I tell you what, Madam Speaker, let
me have just a few minutes, stop the
clock, and let me go around to the
press corps and everybody here and I
am going to accuse you of something.
You did it. You did it. You did it. You
did it. Now prove it is wrong. You did
it.
Guess what? You don’t want to, be-
cause deep down, you know that that is
turning the entire jurisprudence of this
country upside down.
You are not guilty until you are
proven innocent. You are innocent.
And today from this floor, we have
heard the majority leader say this
President is guilty, and not the other
way around.
He is innocent, and these articles
come nowhere close to proving it.
But what is left of this body? Let’s
have an honest conversation, Madam
Speaker.
What we have found over the past few
weeks is that it is okay for the major-
ity to tear down a foreign leader be-
cause they can’t make their case. They
have called him a liar or weak or
worse, or as he was called in the com-
mittee, he even looked like a battered
wife.
It is below the dignity of this body
and this majority to tear down a for-
eign leader because they can’t make
their case against this one.
We have broken rules in this House,
even to this moment. Chairman SCHIFF
and the others have broken H. Res. 660
by not turning over the things that
they should be turning over.
I still have not gotten a transcript
and the White House still has not got-
ten their stuff.
I guess to the minority here, the
rules today don’t matter either.
You see, there is a problem here, be-
cause we are going to vote on this to-
night while breaking the rules. What a
shameful incident.
But we also found a creative inter-
pretation of minority rights. We saw
the rise of partisanship, because of the
things that have been done even fur-
ther.
We have even seen Members smeared
in reports by drive-by political hacks
when they match phone numbers of the
ranking member and members of the
press.
That ought to concern every one of
you as much as it concerns every one
of us. Nothing but a drive-by hit.
But you know something? This ma-
jority leader also just said wherever
law ends, tyranny begins.
But I will say this: In this House,
wherever the rules are disregarded,
chaos and mob rule actually begin, and
the majority has taken that to a new
level.
It has been said today, where is brav-
ery?
I will tell you where bravery is found
and courage is found: It is found in this
minority, who has lived through the
last year of nothing but rules being
broken, people being put down, ques-
tions not being answered, and this ma-
jority saying, Be damned with any-
thing else, we are going to impeach and
do whatever we want to do.
Why? Because we won an election.
I guarantee you, one day you will be
back in the minority, and it ain’t going
to be that fun. Because when you look
at it, when you actually trash the rules
of this House, you want to really look
at: What did you gain at the end by
trashing the institution you claim to
love?
Those are the things we have found
out so far.
But you know they are really careful
in saying, Oh, you want to deal with
process and process.
As I said last night in the Rules Com-
mittee—where they didn’t want to lis-
ten—I will win on process and I will
win on facts, because we have the truth
on our side.
Let me remind you that here is what
the facts actually say. There was no
pressure. Look at the call between
President Zelensky and President
Trump: no pressure. There was no con-
ditionality. There was nothing done to
get the aid, and the aid actually came.

There were five meetings, but when
you look at it right now, none of which
matter, because right now the dark
cloud is descending upon this House.
I am fearful, Madam Speaker, when I
look out into that abyss. I don’t know
what I see, but I tell you what I do see.
I see coming up a President who will
put his head down, even through this
sham impeachment, and he will do his
job. He will put the American people
first. He will tell them, I care about
you. He will still put the economy
first, and he will make sure that this
country stands strong.
That is what I see in this abyss. That
is where we are going.
b 1945
Madam Speaker, it is with that hope
in the future that I recognize right now
that I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from California (Mr. MCCARTHY), the
Republican leader of this House.
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I
must warn you, I am about to say
something my Democratic colleagues
hate to hear: Donald J. Trump is Presi-
dent of the United States. He is Presi-
dent today. He will be President tomor-
row. And he will be President when
this impeachment is over.
Madam Speaker, when they accept
that, maybe this House can get back to
work for the American people.
But, tonight, I rise not as the leader
of the opposition to this impeachment
or as the elected Representative from
the Central Valley of California. I rise
as KEVIN MCCARTHY, citizen, no better,
no worse than the 435 Representatives
who are in this Chamber or the 330 mil-
lion Americans watching this institu-
tion make what I believe to be one of
the worst decisions we have ever made.
It doesn’t matter whether you are
Democrat or Republican, whether you
are liberal or you are conservative,
whether you are the first generation or
the tenth, at our core, we are all Amer-
ican, all of us. We choose our future.
We choose what kind of Nation we
want to be.
Here is our choice tonight: Will we
let impeachment become an exercise of
raw political power, regardless if it
damages our country? Or will we pro-
tect the proper grounds and process for
impeachment now and in the future?
For months, Democrats and many in
the media have attempted to normalize
the impeachment process that would
remove a duly elected President from
office. After 3 years of breathless and
baseless outrage, this is their last at-
tempt to stop the Trump Presidency.
Madam Speaker, Speaker PELOSI
even recently admitted that Democrats
have been working on this impeach-
ment for 21⁄2 years. Those were her
words; they were not mine. Because
they lost to him in 2016, they will do
anything or say anything to stop him
in 2020.
That is not America. That is not how
democratic republics behave. Elections
matter. Voters matter. And in 11
months, the people’s voice will be
heard again.
Impeachment is the most consequen-
tial decision Congress can make other
than sending our men and women into
war. Yet, 85 days ago, Speaker PELOSI
chose to impeach the President of the
United States. She wrote the script and
created an artificial timeline to make
the details fit. Why else are we doing
this just hours before Christmas?
If that is all it was, a rush to judg-
ment, she could be forgiven. But before
the Speaker saw one word, one shred of
evidence, she moved to impeach.
In the past, in this body, such a step
demanded a vote from all of us from
the start, but not only did she move to
impeach before she gave this House and
the hundreds of millions of people we
represent a say in whether to pursue an
impeachment inquiry, she threw out
the bipartisan standards this House
gave Presidents Nixon and Clinton.
That is why I immediately sent
Speaker PELOSI a letter asking her to
follow the rules of history, of tradition,
to follow those standards that have
served America well. What did she say?
She rejected it. She rejected it because
Democrats knew a fair process would
crumble their case.
A fair process would have exposed to
the American public what many al-
ready knew: Democrats have wanted to
impeach President Trump since the
day he was elected, and nothing was
going to get in their way, certainly not
the truth.
Madam Speaker, Chairman SCHIFF
said he had evidence, more than cir-
cumstantial, of collusion. That was
false.
In January, when we all stood in this
body, we stood up, we raised our hands,
and we swore that we would uphold the
Constitution. A few mere hours after
that, Congresswoman TLAIB said she
was going to impeach the mothereffer.
Those are not my words.
A year before taking the majority,
Chairman NADLER campaigned to the
Democrats that he wanted to be chair-
man of the Judiciary Committee,
where impeachment is, The New York
Times writes, Madam Speaker, because
he is the ‘‘strongest Member to lead a
potential impeachment.’’
Congressman RASKIN, a leading Dem-
ocrat on the Judiciary Committee, one
who the Democrats had represent them
in the Rules Committee for these arti-
cles just yesterday, told a crowd he
would impeach President Trump 2 days
before he was even sworn into office.
What we have seen is a rigged process
that has led to the most partisan and
least credible impeachment in the his-
tory of America. That is this legacy.
Any prosecutor in this country would
be disbarred for such blatant bias, espe-
cially if that prosecutor was the fact
witness, the judge, and the jury.
Madam Speaker, Democrats haven’t
just failed on process. They have also
failed on evidence. I have heard a lot of
debate on this floor today, but I
haven’t heard one Member of this body
dispute this simple fact: President
Trump provided lethal aid to Ukraine.
It came before the call; it came after
the call; and it continues to this day.
President Trump provided Ukraine
tank-busting bombs. The previous ad-
ministration, they gave blankets. This
is the truth.
Meanwhile, the Democrat’s case is
based on secondhand opinions and
hearsay. Simply put, there are no
grounds for impeachment.
As constitutional scholar Jonathan
Turley—and I would challenge to say
he is probably the most respected, and
we all know it—a Democrat who did
not vote for the President said, under
oath: There was no bribery. There was
no extortion, no obstruction of justice,
and no abuse of power.
Based on the facts, based on the
truth, based on the lack of evidence,
Turley called this the fastest, thinnest,
and weakest impeachment in U.S. his-
tory.
Such a definitive answer should be
the end of all of this. But Speaker
PELOSI is still moving forward with
this impeachment, without evidence or
facts or truth or public support. The
Speaker says it is out of allegiance to
our Founders.
On this, I agree. I agree with the
Speaker that we should listen to the
Founders. If one does, it is very clear
that this impeachment is unfounded
and improper.
In the Federalist Papers, Alexander
Hamilton wrote there would always be
the greatest danger that impeachment
would be driven by partisan animosity
instead of ‘‘real demonstrations of in-
nocence or guilt’’—that impeachment
would be driven by partisan animosity
instead of ‘‘real demonstrations of in-
nocence or guilt.’’
James Madison, another author of
the Federalist Papers, wrote the dan-
ger of legislative abuse ‘‘must lead to
the same tyranny as is threatened’’ by
executive abuse.
The Founders did not want impeach-
ment to be used for political or par-
tisan battles. If my colleagues do not
want to follow the constitutional high
standards for undoing a national elec-
tion, perhaps they could have followed
Speaker PELOSI’s standard, at least the
one she promised to follow back in
March. It was a very sensible standard.
She said that ‘‘impeachment is so divi-
sive,’’ the evidence must be ‘‘over-
whelming,’’ ‘‘compelling,’’ and ‘‘bipar-
tisan.’’
Not one of those criteria has been
met today. Based on the facts, based on
the evidence, based on the truth, this
impeachment fails even that Pelosi
test.
Those who now say removing Presi-
dent Trump would protect the integ-
rity of our democracy have it back-
ward. By removing a duly elected
President on empty Articles of Im-
peachment, Congress will erode public
trust in our system of government.
I understand they dislike the Presi-
dent, his beliefs, the way he governs,
and even the people who voted for him.
How do I know this? Because they say
so, day in and day out.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H12193
December 18, 2019
In 2016, they even dismissed his sup-
porters, calling us ‘‘deplorables.’’ Now,
they are trying to disqualify our voice
before the 2020 election. They want to
undo the results of the last election to
influence the next one.
As I said, President Trump will still
be President when this is all over. But
Congress will have wasted months of
time and taxpayer dollars on impeach-
ment rather than doing what the
American people want us to do. It
didn’t have to be this way.
Is this why we came here to serve, to
trample on due process rights, to issue
more subpoenas than laws, to appease
the new Democrat-socialist base? That
is not leadership. That is raw partisan
politics, and they know it.
By refusing to acknowledge the truth
or follow the facts by substituting par-
tisan animosity for real demonstra-
tions of innocence or guilt, and by con-
tinuing a 3-year effort to undermine
the President, this impeachment has
divided this Nation without any con-
cern for the repercussions. Moreover,
politicizing this process has discredited
the United States House of Representa-
tives and could forever weaken the
remedy of impeachment.
To again quote Professor Turley, it is
the Democrats’ rush to impeachment
on these grounds, with unfair proce-
dures, that is an ‘‘abuse of power.’’ His-
tory will right that.
Madam Speaker, as I said at the be-
ginning, we face a choice. Do you trust
the wisdom of the people, or do you
deny them a say in their government?
Fortunately, the people will have the
opportunity to speak up and render
their verdict in 11 months.
b 2000
To my fellow Americans, if you ap-
prove of the way this House has con-
ducted their business, if you want to
see your tax dollars go forward to end-
less investigations, support this im-
peachment.
But if you want to restore a working
Congress like the previous Congress
that listened to you and worked to
bring the best economy this country
has ever seen and one that, once again,
will work with the President to get
things done for you and your family,
then join with us in rejecting this base-
less impeachment.
That is what is wonderful about this
system of ours. We are a government
of, by, and for the people. Always re-
member, we work for you, not the
other way around.
Now, I will say this stronger and with
more conviction than I have ever said
it before: In this time of great trial and
tribulation, may God bless America.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Madam Speaker, after 8 hours, let us
return to where we began, with the ar-
ticles themselves.
Article I charges the President of the
United States with abusing the power
of his office by coercing an ally into
cheating in a U.S. election on his be-
half. It charges the President of the
United States with abusing his power
by withholding official acts; by with-
holding a White House meeting that
the President of Ukraine desperately
sought to establish the support of his
most important benefactor, the United
States; by withholding hundreds of
millions of dollars of military aid to a
nation at war in order to get that na-
tion to intervene in our election by
smearing his opponent. That is the gra-
vamen of the charge in Article I.
And what is the defense from my col-
leagues?
And I have listened carefully to my
colleagues for the last 8 hours, and I
have to say, it has been hard for me to
follow. But I think, when you cut
through it all, when you cut through
all of the sound and the fury signifying
nothing, what it really amounts to is
this: Why should we care? Why should
we care about what the President did
to Ukraine?
Well, first of all, we should care
about our allies. We should care about
Ukraine. We should care about a coun-
try struggling to be free in a democ-
racy.
We used to care about democracy. We
used to care about our allies. We used
to stand up to Putin and Russia.
We used to. I know the party of Ron-
ald Reagan used to.
Why should we care about Ukraine?
But, of course, it is about more than
Ukraine. It is about us. It is about our
national security.
Their fight is our fight. Their defense
is our defense.
When Russia remakes the map of Eu-
rope for the first time since World War
II by dint of military force and Ukraine
fights back, it is our fight, too.
And when the President sacrifices
our interests, our national security for
his election, he is sacrificing our coun-
try for his personal gain.
That is the gravamen of Article I.
Article II charges the President of
the United States with obstructing the
Congress, with denying the Congress
any witness, any document, by telling
all of his administration people: You
will not appear. You will ignore a co-
equal branch of government.
And what is the defense to this from
my colleagues again? It is: Why should
we care? He is the President of our
party. Why should we care if he ignores
this Congress?
Well, I remind my friends that he
will not be the last President. There
will be another President, and you may
be, one day—although you do not act
like it—you may one day be in the ma-
jority, and you will want to hold a
President accountable.
What will you say when that Presi-
dent says: ‘‘You are a paper tiger. You
have no oversight. I can ignore your
subpoenas’’? What will you say? What
will you argue?
‘‘Well, no, no, that was different.
Then we were in the minority. Then it
was a Republican President.’’
Will that be your argument? Is that
how little faith you have in our democ-
racy and our Constitution? Is that how
poorly you defend and uphold our Con-
stitution?
But, finally, let me ask this question
that overrides it all: Why should we
care about any of this?
I will bring you to one conversation
that came to light, because it is not
the most important conversation, but,
in many ways, it is the most revealing.
It took place on September 14 in
Ukraine, when Ambassador Volker sat
down with Andriy Yermak, the top ad-
viser to Zelensky, and he did what he
should do. He supported the rule of law,
and he said: You, Andriy Yermak,
should not investigate the last Presi-
dent, President Poroshenko, for polit-
ical reasons. You should not engage in
political investigations.
And do you know what Yermak said:
Oh, you mean like what you want us to
do with the Bidens and the Clintons?
And in that abrupt, brutal retort, we
see why we should care, because what
he was saying is: You, America, have
forgotten what it means to uphold the
rule of law. You have forgotten what it
means to say that no one is above the
law. We are a struggling democracy,
but even we know better than that.
What is at risk here is the very idea
of America. That idea holds that we
are a nation of laws, not of men. We
are a nation that believes in the rule of
law.
When we say we uphold the Constitu-
tion, we are not talking about a piece
of parchment; we are talking about a
beautiful architecture in which ambi-
tion is set against ambition, in which
no branch of government can dominate
another. That is what it means to up-
hold the Constitution.
If you ignore it, if you say the Presi-
dent may refuse to comply, may refuse
lawful process, may coerce an ally,
may cheat in an election because he is
the President of our party, you do not
uphold our Constitution. You do not
uphold your oath of office.
Well, I will tell you this: I will up-
hold mine. I will vote to impeach Don-
ald Trump.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, on March 7,
1788, six months after the Constitution was
signed at Independence Hall, Alexander Ham-
ilton laid out in detail the standards for im-
peachment in the Federalist papers.
Impeachment should, quote ‘proceed from
the misconduct of public men, or, in other
words, from the abuse or violation of some
public trust,’ Hamilton wrote.
Donald Trump has without question met
these standards.
These words from our framers—they don’t
only serve as guidance for people in this
country.
They serve as guidance for people around
the world wishing to build a sound system of
government.
And they have allowed us in the United
States of America, to stand for democracy and
the rule of law around the world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H12194 December 18, 2019
So as the world watches, captivated and be-
wildered by the lawlessness of our president,
I hope they are also able to see the full func-
tioning of our democracy as we hold him ac-
countable.
With this impeachment vote, the world is
able to see the fruits of our democracy and
the glory of the checks and balances pre-
served in our Constitution.
Unlike the dictatorship that my family fled
from, in a democracy, we don’t just vote. We
get to impeach a lawless president.
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I speak in op-
position to the unprecedented and unauthor-
ized impeachment of the President of the
United States.
Since the day after the 2016 election, many
of my colleagues have vowed to impeach
President Trump and have since spent more
than two years searching for a reason to do it.
Today, they have brought forward two arti-
cles of impeachment based on unfounded ac-
cusations of abuse of power and obstruction.
Despite a lack of evidence, an unfair proc-
ess and no bipartisan support, my colleagues
across the aisle have barreled toward im-
peachment, ignoring or delaying key priorities
like the US-Canada-Mexico Agreement along
the way.
This is a sad day and the fact remains that
this effort seeks to overturn the 2016 election
not based on evidence, but on a disdain for
President Trump.
I will vote against the articles of impeach-
ment before us because I think the American
people deserve better from the House of Rep-
resentatives.
So on behalf of hardworking Kansans in the
Fourth District and Americans across our
country, I call on my colleagues to vote
against articles of impeachment and focus on
priorities that matter like growing our econ-
omy, supporting our veterans and military,
lowering prescription drug costs, and helping
Americans prepare for jobs and retirement.
That’s what the American people sent us
here to do and it’s time we got back to work
and beyond this shameful impeachment.
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. Madam
Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this par-
tisan impeachment spectacle that seeks to ac-
complish what President Trump’s opponents
failed to do at the ballot box in 2016. The bed-
rock of this country is our Constitution. Article
II of the United States Constitution grants our
President the necessary authority to deal with
other nations and their leaders.
This President was lawfully elected by the
American people. When President Trump was
sworn into office, he assumed the role of our
nation’s Commander-in-Chief. And, as Com-
mander-in-Chief, he has done absolutely noth-
ing illegal. The impeachment votes today are
a sad continuation of the efforts that have
been underway since President Trump was
elected.
The majority has wrongly denied President
Trump the fair process that was afforded to
President Clinton and President Nixon at
every stage of this investigation. I am also
profoundly disappointed that the House Judici-
ary Committee refused to hold a minority day
hearing in compliance with Clause 2(j)(l) of
Rule XI of the Rules of the House.
It should also greatly concern all Americans
that co-equal subpoena authority was not
granted to the minority during this hyper-par-
tisan process. Co-equal subpoena authority for
both the minority and majority has been a
bedrock of past impeachment investigations. I
am disappointed that my resolution, H. Res.
667, which would have granted co-equal sub-
poena authority to the minority and majority,
was not adopted.
Instead of working to combat rising prescrip-
tion drug prices, securing our southern border,
protecting religious freedom, and reining in
out-of-control government spending, my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle have
been laser-focused on removing President
Trump from office for purely political reasons.
I want to remind those who are leading this
ridiculous waste of taxpayer resources that
there will be another election in 2020. The
next election is the avenue for deciding a new
president, not this. Throughout the history of
this country, impeachment has been a rare
process. With today’s impeachment, I worry
that in the next 230 years of our republic, it
will be rare that a president is not impeached.
On behalf of my fellow Tennesseans, and
on behalf of my constituents in the Sixth Dis-
trict of Tennessee, I stand with our President
and Commander-in-Chief and will vote ‘‘no’’ on
both articles of impeachment.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, long before
today’s votes were scheduled, my wife Karen
and I made arrangements to visit our son
Joshua in Tanzania where he’s serving in the
Peace Corp. At the White House last week I
informed President Trump that I would not be
present for these votes, and he was sup-
portive of me visiting my son. I told him I did
not support his impeachment, and I have re-
quested that this statement of my reasons for
opposing both articles of impeachment be en-
tered into the Congressional Record.
I’ve been to Ukraine twice this year. I was
an observer of the second round of the Presi-
dential election on April 21, 2019. I returned
with a bipartisan Congressional delegation
from September 28 thru October 5, 2019 right
in the middle of this supposed controversy.
We met with many people. We met with our
embassy leadership. We also met with the
Ukrainian Foreign Minister and Minister of De-
fense. We had a chance to visit our soldiers
who are helping in the training mission of the
Ukrainian military. During that time, we met
with the military leadership of both countries.
Finally, we met with members of the Ukrainian
parliament. During all these meeting no one
mentioned a quid pro quo.
What I also know is this: The Trump Admin-
istration provided the long-overdue aid to
Ukraine, including lethal Javelin anti-tank mis-
siles, that had been authorized by Congress
but withheld by the previous administration in
their misguided efforts to appease Russia.
Other assistance to Ukraine was temporarily
delayed this year following the election of a
new president—a political outsider we knew
little about.
The new president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,
also addressed this issue several times. He
has rejected the accusation that any quid pro
quo or any pressure was applied to him or the
Ukrainian government. The aid was also re-
leased prior to the Ukrainian government
being pulled into this political controversy.
These observations convince me that the first
article of impeachment, ‘‘abuse of power,’’ is
not credible.
My experience in Congress, including during
the impeachment of President Clinton, likewise
convinces me the second article of impeach-
ment, ‘‘obstruction of congress,’’ is not a cred-
ible charge.
Constant tension exists between our legisla-
tive and executive branches of government.
Every president I’ve served with has said at
one time or another he is empowered to do
this or to withhold that. When Congress dis-
agrees, we have at times taken those ques-
tions of executive authority or privilege to our
third branch of government: the courts. But the
Democrats haven’t even given President
Trump an opportunity to defend his executive
privilege through the courts, and they’re de-
manding that he just give up his constitutional
powers under Article II.
I’m disappointed to miss these votes but not
embarrassed. I’m embarrassed that they are
even happening.
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to op-
pose the articles of impeachment which have
been produced by this flawed process, which
was based on hearsay and testimony largely
collected from a closed-door, one-sided inves-
tigation.
In fact, the only witness we heard from who
had direct knowledge of the conversation in
question, testified that President Trump did not
want a quid pro quo and confirmed that the
aid to Ukraine was released without the
launching of any investigation that the Presi-
dent’s detractors say he was seeking.
The two articles of impeachment in the res-
olution—abuse of power and obstruction of
Congress—are broad and cite no specific
crimes that the President committed. The
House Democrats are basing the entire im-
peachment on hearsay testimonies grounded
on absolutely no evidence of a crime.
However, last week we had a look at some
real wrongdoing. We found out from the Jus-
tice Department’s Inspector General that the
investigation into whether President Trump
colluded with the Russians was based on
fraudulent information filed with the secret
court. The FBI was found to have withheld ex-
culpatory evidence and senior FBI leaders
were found to have manipulated facts in order
to support this false collusion narrative, justify
their investigation and expand it. This hap-
pened on multiple occasions.
While the Mueller investigation found no col-
lusion, some Members of Congress, like
House Impeachment Leader ADAM SCHIFF,
knowingly promoted this falsehood and used
similar tactics to engineer this impeachment
inquiry. This is unacceptable.
For the above reason, I voted to censor
Chairman ADAM SCHIFF and will vote against
these articles of impeachment.
We know this impeachment is a sham. They
know this impeachment is a sham. They know
that we know it is a sham.
We all know this shameful impeachment
began the moment the President was elected,
long before he ever had a single telephone
call with any foreign government. We’ve heard
the numerous quotations by those on the
other side that validate that fact. And, yet the
other side persists in attempting to over-turn
the results of the legitimate election of Presi-
dent Donald J. Trump, because he dares to
drain a swamp to which they are beholden.
When the President calls for an investiga-
tion of corruption, the other side calls it
‘‘digging for dirt.’’ When they dig for dirt, they
call it an ‘‘investigation.’’
This is a sad day for America. This im-
peachment is the worst case of partisan poli-
tics in the history of our Republic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H12195
December 18, 2019
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
there is no joy for me in the impeachment
process, because I know the nature of im-
peachment is polarizing. Unfortunately, based
on his own words, conduct, and the evidence
from credible witnesses, there is no other op-
tion but to impeach.
The first article alleges the President
abused the power of his office for personal
gain. He withheld military aid and an Oval Of-
fice meeting from a foreign government unless
they gave him dirt he could use against his
likely challenger to help his own re-election
bid. The President admitted he did this. This
conversation was in the transcript the White
House released. Two State Department offi-
cials’ texts and phone calls confirmed the tran-
script and the President’s own words.
The second article alleges the President ob-
structed Congress by refusing to comply with
the lawful requests made by Congress in the
impeachment inquiry. President Trump repeat-
edly instructed government officials and agen-
cies not to cooperate and spurn subpoenas. In
the history of impeachment in our country, this
has never happened. No President or Admin-
istration facing impeachment has ever cat-
egorically denied subpoenas and refused re-
quests for documents, until President Trump.
The facts are not in dispute. The President
and his Chief of Staff have admitted they did
it and told us ‘‘we do that all the time, get over
it.’’ We must not get over it. We must not let
the abnormal become the normal. We cannot
allow this President to ‘‘do whatever he wants’’
if it violates the Constitution and laws of the
United States.
To not impeach would say to future presi-
dents they can disregard the Constitutional au-
thority given to Congress. To not impeach
would announce to foreign countries that
America’s presidency is for sale. To not im-
peach would tell future presidents they too can
try to rig an election in their favor instead of
letting voters decide. To not impeach would
say our President is above the law.
The President and Members of Congress
take an oath to the Constitution. The President
violated his oath, but I will not violate mine.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, for the first
time in history, the House is moving to im-
peach a duly-elected president without assert-
ing a crime. Instead, they are charging Presi-
dent Trump with a vague ‘‘abuse of power’’ for
allegedly conditioning U.S. security assistance
to Ukraine on an investigation into an energy
company.
This deeply flawed inquiry did not produce
clear evidence or bipartisan support. At a min-
imum, one would expect bipartisan support for
such an extraordinary measure.
As a former federal prosecutor with the Pub-
lic Integrity Section of the Department of Jus-
tice, I approached this inquiry with the same
standards I would have applied to any case I
handled during that time. During six weeks of
depositions, I listened diligently and sought out
relevant facts. But the Majority, driven by a
political timeline, insisted on a rush to judg-
ment with an incomplete factual record. In-
stead of interviewing multiple people with first-
hand knowledge, they settled for speculation
and innuendo.
Ultimately, my colleagues on the other side
of the aisle failed to prove the President tied
U.S. aid to a political investigation. Here’s
what we learned instead:
The president placed a temporary hold on
U.S. security assistance in mid-July and re-
leased it September 11 without Ukraine ever
announcing an investigation.
Multiple witnesses provided testimony that
the pause was due to the President’s long-
standing concerns about corruption in Ukraine.
It took for firsthand accounts from administra-
tive officials, such as Vice President Mike
Pence, to see the sincerity of Ukraine’s new
President Volodymyr Zelensky. He cam-
paigned as an anti-corruption reformer and
made historic progress after his party took
over the Ukrainian parliament in August.
The Democrats’ key witness—of which there
was the only one who talked with the Presi-
dent about the aid—is Ambassador Gordon
Sondland. When pressed, Sondland admitted
he never knew why the aid was delayed. Nei-
ther President Trump, nor anyone else, ever
told him that aid was tied to investigations,
and any opinion he expressed to others about
such a connection was only him ‘‘speculating.’’
President Zelensky and his senior advisor
Andriy Yermak, the key Ukrainians in the
Democrat narrative, have repeatedly and
strongly denied they were ever pressured or
given any sense that the temporary hold was
connected to investigation requests. Indeed,
they were not even aware of the hold until it
was publicly reported in the press.
History will judge this inquiry for the rush to
impeach President Trump without direct evi-
dence, in defiance of historic precedent and
as a one-sided political probe. The ‘‘investiga-
tion’’ was held in the most secret room in the
Capitol. Depositions occurred on days law-
makers were out of town. The Minority was
denied basic fairness and did not allow them
to call a single witness. The administration
was not allowed to bring executive branch
lawyers to defend themselves during deposi-
tions.
This contrasts with previous impeachment
inquiries, where Presidents Nixon and Clinton
could have administration lawyers attend all
depositions and hearings, ask questions,
make objections, present evidence, and re-
quest their own witnesses. Those rights were
denied in this inquiry, as this impeachment
process was weaponized for political gain.
Opposing impeachment does not mean em-
bracing every decision made by the adminis-
tration in this case. I strongly disagreed with
the hold on the security assistance that Con-
gress had appropriated for Ukraine and wrote
an urgent letter with the gentleman from New
York, Chairman ELIOT ENGEL, a week before
the aid was released. Then and now, I believe
that unwavering support for Ukraine to counter
Russian malign influence is a vital component
of U.S. national security.
But the truth is, Democrats began their
three-year effort to impeach the President the
day he was sworn into office. In fact, 104 of
my Democratic colleagues voted for impeach-
ment before the phone call between President
Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky ever
took place.
Our constitutional order demands far more
than this to remove a duly-elected President.
Sixty-three million Americans voted for Presi-
dent Trump. With an election less than a year
away, Americans should decide their elected
president at the ballot box, as our Constitution
requires.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker,
the U.S. Constitution is clear and unambig-
uous—impeachment of any president is per-
mitted only for treason, bribery, high crimes
and misdemeanors.
Undoing the will of the people expressed in
a free and fair election with the proposed arti-
cles of impeachment, totally fails to meet the
legal standard prescribed by the U.S. Con-
stitution. Despite hearings and a process that
were egregiously flawed and unfair, there is
still no direct evidence whatsoever of any
crime.
Disagreement with or intense dislike for this
or any other president of the United States is
not now—nor should it ever be—grounds for
impeachment.
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, when I
made the decision to return to Congress, I did
so with a clear understanding of how impor-
tant this moment is for our country and the de-
mocracy of our nation. My desire to serve has
always been to help people who deserve an
effective voice fighting for them.
I did not come to Congress to impeach a
president. Despite the ongoing inquiry, I’ve re-
mained laser-focused on the issues that I hear
from my constituents most often—access to
affordable health care, lowering the cost of
prescription drug prices, passing common-
sense gun reforms that will make our commu-
nities safer, and addressing income inequality
in all of its forms.
My role as the Representative for Nevada’s
Fourth Congressional District also includes
faithfully preserving and upholding our Con-
stitution and the system of laws and norms
that undergird our federal government. Our
Constitution clearly lays out Congress’ role in
protecting our democratic institutions and the
delicate balance that exists within it. Today,
the House of Representatives is voting to up-
hold this solemn responsibility to hold Presi-
dent Trump accountable.
In an effort to fulfill my obligation to uphold
our Constitution and the rule of law, I have
paid careful attention to the investigations of
the impeachment inquiry in the House of Rep-
resentatives. The Committees of jurisdiction
and witnesses have brought forward evidence
uncovering the truth of President Trump’s July
phone call and subsequent inappropriate be-
havior toward President Volodymyr Zelensky
of Ukraine.
It has become apparent that President
Trump is a continuing threat to our democracy
and danger to our national security. He
abused the power of his office for personal
and political gain at the expense of our na-
tional security; he conditioned official acts—
millions in military aid and a White House
meeting—for his personal, political gain; and
he attempted to cheat our democracy and cor-
rupt our elections. And so today, I will vote in
favor of the two articles of impeachment
against President Trump. No one is above the
law. Not even the President.
The first article of impeachment charges
President Trump with violating his oath of of-
fice by abusing the powers of the Presidency
when he solicited the interference of Ukraine
in the 2020 United States presidential election.
The second article of impeachment charges
President Trump with violating his oath of of-
fice by obstructing justice and directing defi-
ance of subpoenas issued by the House as
part of its impeachment inquiry. This is no
longer a question of facts, it is a question of
duty—my duty to this country, our Constitu-
tion, and my oath of office to uphold that Con-
stitution and protect our democracy.
This decision took careful thought and con-
sideration. When I made my oath of office, I

swore to uphold the Constitution of the United
States and to serve this country. As difficult as
this moment is for the country given the polit-
ical divisiveness, preserving the integrity of our
system for posterity is how I can best serve
the interests of the people of Nevada. I hope
that following this vote I can turn my full atten-
tion back toward the issues that matter to Ne-
vada’s working families.
My mission in Washington has not changed,
and I’ll continue to fight for the issues that will
improve the lives of my constituents. My focus
will be on their stories and passing legislation
to positively advance their futures. I will con-
tinue to work to lower health care costs for all
Nevadans, to bring down the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs, to protect our children from mind-
less gun violence, and to ensure all Nevadans
have access to well-paying jobs and acces-
sible job training programs. It is the honor of
my life to serve the people of Nevada’s Fourth
Congressional District and I will continue to
put their interests first as I work to deliver on
their behalf.
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I’m pretty
angry.
I’m angry with you, the Speaker of the
House. I’m angry with Chairman ADAM SCHIFF.
I’m angry with the Chairman JERRY NADLER.
I’m angry they’re putting the country through
this.
They’ve bastardized the tool of impeach-
ment and are attempting to use it to overturn
the votes of 63 million people.
In just a few short hours, our president will
be the first president in history to be im-
peached by just one single political party.
Every person who is responsible for getting
us to this point should be held accountable.
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, tonight, I will
vote for impeachment. The President threat-
ened to withhold Congressionally approved
military aid to an ally under Russian attack un-
less the ally, a foreign government, agreed to
help the President with his campaign. That is
an abuse of power. The President refused to
cooperate with Congress’s constitutional duty
to provide oversight. That is obstruction.
As drastic and unwelcome as this is, inac-
tion would not only give this president a li-
cense to further abuse power and obstruct,
but set a dangerous precedent for all future
presidents, that their misdeeds are immune
from consequences. Inaction would also seri-
ously undermine our system of government by
relegating the Congress to a less than co-
equal branch of government.
As difficult as this is for our country, I be-
lieve this is the right thing to do for our coun-
try.
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, the
President should be impeached. His actions
were an abuse of power that jeopardizes
America’s national security and compromises
our elections. No one is above the law, and
that includes the President. By withholding
$400 million Ukraine desperately needed to
defend itself against Russia until Ukraine did
the President’s political bidding, the President
committed High Crimes and Misdemeanors for
which he should be impeached under Article I,
Section 2, Clause 5 and Article II, Section 4 of
the Constitution.
This abuse of power is compounded by the
President’s refusal to cooperate with Con-
gress’ impeachment investigation and his
stonewalling of witnesses from testifying or
turning over documents to Congress.
Almost 14,000 people have been killed
since Russia invaded Ukraine. Withholding
$400 million Congress appropriated to help
Ukraine defend herself unless Ukraine helped
the President dig up dirt on his political rival
Joe Biden was the last straw for me. People’s
lives and our national security were placed at
risk. This was more than paying hush money
for strippers, profiting from foreign govern-
ments staying at resort properties, or even ob-
structing justice as laid out in the Mueller Re-
port.
The Founders fought and died for freedom
and independence from a tyrannical ruler and
foreign government. Impeachment and re-
moval from office was the remedy they in-
cluded in the Constitution to act as a check on
a President who placed himself above the law,
abused his power for his own personal benefit,
and invited foreign governments to get in-
volved in our domestic affairs, especially our
elections. A President who flaunts the separa-
tion of powers and checks and balances in our
Constitution and who refuses to allow wit-
nesses to appear before Congress would re-
ceive our Founders’ universal condemnation.
Treating taxpayer money as his own to ex-
tort a ‘‘favor’’ from a foreign government to aid
him in his re-election goes to the very heart of
concerns raised by our Nation’s Founders
when they drafted and advocated for impeach-
ment to act as a check on the awesome pow-
ers of the chief executive. For instance, Madi-
son said in Federalist No. 47, ‘‘the accumula-
tion of all powers, legislative, executive and ju-
diciary, in the same hands . . . may justly be
pronounced the very definition of tyranny.’’ He
went on to say during the Constitutional Con-
vention, ‘‘the Executive will have great oppor-
tunities of abusing his power,’’ and further that
a President ‘‘might betray his trust to foreign
powers.’’ George Washington’s Farewell Ad-
dress warned of ‘‘foreign influence and corrup-
tion’’ which leads to the ‘‘policy and will’’ of
America being ‘‘subjected to the policy and will
of another.’’ Alexander Hamilton wrote in Fed-
eralist No. 65 that impeachment ‘‘proceeds
from the misconduct of public men . . . from
the abuse or violation of a public trust.’’
The USA Today editorial board stated it per-
fectly when they wrote in their December 12,
2019 editorial:
In his thuggish effort to trade American
arms for foreign dirt on former vice presi-
dent Joe Biden and his son Hunter, Trump
resembles not so much Clinton as he does
Richard Nixon, another corrupt president
who tried to cheat his way to re-election . . .
This isn’t party politics as usual. It is pre-
cisely the misconduct the Framers had in
mind when they wrote impeachment into the
Constitution.
Impeachment is the remedy the Founders
placed in the Constitution to remove a Presi-
dent during his or her term of office. This is
especially true when the misconduct involves
an upcoming election. The President invited
foreign participation in our elections at least
three times. First with, ‘‘Russia, if you’re listen-
ing . . .,’’ second with his demands on
Ukraine to ‘‘do us a favor, though,’’ and third
with his request for China to get involved in
the 2020 election by starting ‘‘an investigation
into the Bidens.’’ Any further delay or simply
allowing the election cycle to run its course re-
sults in the harm and abuse impeachment was
designed to prevent.
For the sake of the Constitution, fair elec-
tions free of foreign interference, and our na-
tional security, President Trump should be im-
peached.
Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in support of the impeachment of
Donald J. Trump. This is not a joyous mo-
ment. Impeachment ought to be an act that is
exceedingly rare. Madam Speaker, this is one
of those rare occasions because this Presi-
dent’s abuse of power strikes at the very heart
of our republic.
I was initially one of the holdouts on im-
peachment, preferring first to see a strong, de-
fensible case that Donald Trump had abused
the power of his office before endorsing such
a serious step. When it became clear that
President Trump abused the power of his of-
fice by attempting to extort the Ukraine gov-
ernment by withholding military aid in ex-
change for a political investigation, our only
choice was to move forward on impeachment.
Mr. Trump attempted to use the power of the
Presidency to subvert democracy itself.
My Republican friends argue, in part, that
no crime was committed because Mr.
Zelensky claims he never felt pressure when
asked to criminally investigate the political rival
of the most powerful man in the world. I agree
in part. These crimes were not committed
against Mr. Zelensky. Donald Trump believes
that the power of the Presidency is his per-
sonal tool to coerce the weak to do his bid-
ding. If it had not been Mr. Zelensky, it would
have been some other poor fellow com-
promised by need or greed. These crimes
were committed against the Republic and the
American people who belong to it. And the
power of impeachment was given to this body
to save us from small men entrusted with
great power. In 1787, Benjamin Franklin was
asked this simple question: ‘‘What have we
got, a republic or a monarchy?’’ I hope that
my colleagues will answer as Mr. Franklin did:
‘‘A republic, if we can keep it.’’ I will vote yes
to impeach the President of the United States.
I urge my colleagues to do the same.
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to express my support for the im-
peachment of Donald J. Trump.
Today’s vote to impeach the President is
sobering. While I have deep disagreements
with President Trump on immigration, health
care, climate change and other policy areas, I
did not come to Washington to impeach the
President. I came to represent the voices of
my constituents and I take my duty very seri-
ously.
The facts tell a disturbing yet highly con-
sistent story. The President’s misdeeds have
been verified by an immense body of evidence
and the testimony of dozens of witnesses—in-
cluding civil servants and constitutional schol-
ars of the highest caliber. President Trump
abused his power to bribe another country for
his own personal and political gain. This is
wrong.
I voted to impeach President Trump to do
right by my constituents, the future of our de-
mocracy, and to uphold the rule of law and my
oath to defend the Constitution. The facts are
clear. The President obstructed Congressional
investigations by instructing his accomplices to
ignore compulsory calls to testify before Con-
gress. No matter how he tries to spin it, Presi-
dent Trump violated the Constitution and must
be held accountable. Regrettably, House and
Senate Republicans are going along with the
President’s lies and attempts to cover up his
actions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H12197
December 18, 2019
No one is above the law, not even the
President.
Donald Trump indisputably violated the Con-
stitution and is, without a shadow of a doubt,
no longer fit to discharge the duties of the
President of the United States of America.
I urge my colleagues to support these arti-
cles of impeachment.
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam
Speaker, this year, our nation finds itself in the
midst of historic turmoil. President Donald J.
Trump’s defiance of the Constitution and dis-
regard for the rule of law have given Congress
no other choice but to proceed with impeach-
ment. The President has brought this on him-
self through his actions. As instructed by H.
Res. 660, on November 19, 2019, the House
Permanent Select Intelligence Committee
began conducting open public hearings to en-
sure the American people were able to hear
directly from witnesses as the committee col-
lects and examines evidence in a fair and pro-
fessional manner. This was followed by public
hearings in the House Committee on the Judi-
ciary, which allowed for an examination of the
constitutional grounds for impeachment and
an airing of evidence against the President.
After weeks of depositions, public hearings
and a thorough review of evidence, the House
Judiciary Committee concluded that President
Trump violated his oath of office and, on De-
cember 11th, 2019, approved H. Res. 755,
which set forth two articles of impeachment:
Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress.
As the House today deliberates and decides
on these articles, it is important to lay the full
scope of the President’s misconduct before
the American people.
My constituent and authentic American lead-
er, Ralph Nader, a consumer advocate, re-
nowned attorney, author, and a respected
voice in American politics and good govern-
ance, has partnered with constitutional schol-
ars, Bruce Fein and Louis Fisher, to assess
the President’s misconduct and whether it
meets the Constitutional standard for ‘‘. . .
Bribery, or other High Crimes and Mis-
demeanors.’’
I include in the RECORD his thinking and
those of others in our nation, in the hopes that
it will help the public further understand the
significance of this vote.
ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT
(By Ralph Nader, Bruce Fein, and Louis
Fisher)
ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT
Resolved. That Donald J. Trump, President
of the United States, is impeached for brib-
ery and high crimes and misdemeanors in
violation of his constitutional oath of office
and that the following article of impeach-
ment be exhibited to the Senate:
Article of Impeachment Exhibited by the
House of Representatives of the United
States of America and of All the People of
the United States of America, Against Don-
ald J. Trump, President of the United States
of America, in Maintenance and Support of
its Impeachment Against Him for Bribery
and High Crimes and Misdemeanors in Viola-
tion of his Constitutional Oath of Office To
Preserve, Protect and Defend the Constitu-
tion of the United States.
ARTICLE 1
In his conduct of the office of President of
the United States, Donald J. Trump, in vio-
lation of his constitutional duty faithfully to
execute the office of the President of the
United States, and, to the best of his ability,
preserve, protect and defend the Constitu-
tion of the United States, Article 1, section
1, clause 6, and, contrary to his public trust,
has systematically scorned the letter and
spirit of the Constitution on a scale vastly
beyond any previous occupant of the White
House in doing the following:
1. CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS. President
Trump has notoriously boasted, ‘‘Then I
have Article II, where I have the right to do
whatever I want as President.’’ He has chron-
ically acted in violation the Constitution ac-
cordingly.
The informing or oversight powers of Con-
gress are even more important than its legis-
lative prerogatives. The United States Su-
preme Court has repeatedly affirmed the ple-
nary authority of Congress to investigate
the executive branch for abuses, irregular-
ities, illegalities or the need for new laws.
Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis fa-
mously lectured, sunshine is said to be the
best of disinfectants; electric light the most
efficient policeman. The House Judiciary
Committee voted an article of impeachment
against President Richard M. Nixon for
defying a congressional subpoena that com-
promised the ability of Congress to inves-
tigate impeachable offenses.
President Trump has repeatedly and un-
constitutionally systematically undermined
the congressional oversight power, including
the ongoing congressional impeachment in-
quiry of the President himself, by instruct-
ing numerous current and former White
House staff and members of the executive
branch to defy congressional subpoenas on
an unprecedented scale far beyond any pre-
vious President. Without congressional au-
thority, he has secretly deployed special
forces abroad and employed secret guidelines
for targeted killings, including American
citizens, based on secret unsubstantiated in-
formation. He has unconstitutionally en-
deavored to block private persons or entities
from responding to congressional requests or
subpoenas for information, e.g., Deutsche
Bank. He has refused to provide Congress in-
formation about nepotistic or other security
clearances he granted in opposition to his
own FBI security experts. He has refused to
disclose his tax returns to the Chairman of
the Ways and Means Committee contrary to
a 1924 law, 26 U.S.C. 6103(f).
The informing or oversight powers of Con-
gress are even more bedrock than legisla-
tion. Without information, Congress cannot
enact informed legislative bills, repeal inad-
equate laws, or prevent maladministration of
good ones. The Supreme Court of the United
States has repeatedly affirmed the authority
of Congress to investigate the executive
branch for abuses, irregularities, illegalities
or the need for new laws. Transparency, not
secrecy, is the coin of the realm.
Congress possesses plenary authority inde-
pendent of the federal judiciary to determine
whether presidential defiance or obstruction
of a congressional subpoena warrants im-
peachment for destroying the rule of law in
favor of raw presidential power. A court
order is unnecessary. Under the Constitu-
tion, the Supreme Court held impeachment
questions are assigned to the House and Sen-
ate to the exclusion of federal courts in
Nixon v. United States, 506 U.S. 224 (1993).
2. ABUSE OF THE POWERS OF THE
PRESIDENT AND ABUSE OF PUBLIC
TRUST. President Abraham Lincoln fa-
mously declared that, ‘‘A house divided
against itself cannot stand.’’ The nation’s
motto is E Pluribus Unum. President Trump,
however, has fostered combustible division
and rancor among ‘‘We the people of the
United States’’ by inciting violence and
threatening civil war if removed from office.
Unlike prior presidents, he has made presi-
dential lies as routine as the rising and set-
ting of the sun, confounding civil discourse,
truth and public trust. He has disrespected,
belittled, and serially preyed upon women,
mocked the disabled, incited violence
against the mainstream media and critics,
and encouraged and displayed bigotry to-
wards minorities and minority Members of
Congress, including intercession with Israel
in serious violation of the Speech or Debate
Clause, Article I, section 6, clause 1, to deny
two Members visitor visas.
Mr. Trump has failed to superintend or
check the chronic lawlessness of his subordi-
nates, a dereliction of duty which James
Madison characterized as an impeachable of-
fense. In the very first Congress, Mr. Madi-
son elaborated:
‘‘I think it absolutely necessary that the
President should have the power of removing
his subordinates from office; it will make
him, in a peculiar manner, responsible for
their conduct, and subject him to impeach-
ment himself, if he suffers them to per-
petrate with impunity high crimes or mis-
demeanors against the United States, or ne-
glects to superintend their conduct, so as to
check their excesses.’’
George Washington when presiding over
the constitutional convention instructed,
‘‘Let us raise a standard to which the wise
and honest can repair.’’ Mr. Trump has so
disrespected that standard.
No other President has so consistently
voiced extremist and inflammatory views
across the board and so grossly neglected the
duties of the Oval Office.
3. APPROPRIATIONS CLAUSE, REVENUE
CLAUSE. Article I, section 9, clause 7 pro-
hibits federal government expenditures ‘‘but
in consequence of appropriations made by
law.’’ Congress has consistently voted much
less money than President Trump requested
to build an extensive, multibillion-dollar
wall with Mexico. In violation of the Clause
and the criminal prohibition of the Anti-De-
ficiency Act, President Trump has com-
mitted to spending billions of dollars far in
excess of what Congress has appropriated for
the wall. The congressional power of the
purse is a cornerstone of the Constitution’s
separation of powers. James Madison in Fed-
eralist 58 explained, ‘‘This power over the
purse may . . . be regarded as the most com-
plete and effectual weapon with which any
constitution can arm the immediate rep-
resentatives of the people, for obtaining re-
dress of every grievance, and to carrying
into effect every just and salutary measure.’’
Article I, section 7, clause 1 requires all
revenue measures to originate in the House
of Representatives. In violation of the
Clause, President Trump has raised tens of
billions of dollars by unilaterally imposing
tariffs with limitless discretion under sec-
tion 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.
He has become a Foreign Trade Czar in im-
posing tariffs or quotas or granting exemp-
tions from his trade restrictions in his unbri-
dled discretion to assist political friends and
punish political enemies. Literally trillions
of dollars in international trade have been
affected. Riches are made and livelihoods de-
stroyed overnight with the capricious stroke
of President Trump’s pen.
4. EMOLUMENTS CLAUSE. Article I, sec-
tion 9, clause 8 prohibits the President (and
other federal officers), without the consent
of Congress, from accepting any ‘‘present,
emolument, office, or title, of any kind
whatsoever, from any King, Prince, or for-
eign state.’’ The President should be above
suspicion. The clause aims to prohibit dual
loyalties or its appearance because of finan-
cial conflicts of interests. President Trump
has notoriously refused to place his assets in
a blind trust. Instead, he continues to profit
from opulent hotels heavily patronized by
foreign governments. He has permitted his
family to commercialize the White House.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H12198 December 18, 2019
He has compromised the national interest to
enrich family wealth on a scale unprece-
dented in the history of the presidency.
5. TREATY CLAUSE. Article II, section 2,
clause 2 requires Senate ratification of trea-
ties by two-thirds majorities. The text is si-
lent as to whether treaty termination re-
quires Senate ratification, and the Supreme
Court held the issue was a nonjusticiable po-
litical question in Goldwater v. Carter, 444
U.S. 996 (1979). But the Treaty Clause purpose
indicates Senate approval of treaty termi-
nations. Alexander Hamilton explained in
Federalist 75 that the President would be an
untrustworthy steward of the national inter-
est in the conduct of international affairs be-
cause of the enormous temptation to betray
the country to advance personal ambitions.
That suspicion of presidential motives is
equally implicated in treaty terminations
and points to requiring Senate ratification.
President Trump flouted the Treaty Clause
in terminating the Intermediate-Range Nu-
clear Forces Treaty (INF) with Russia uni-
laterally. The treaty assigned the termi-
nation decision to the ‘‘United States.’’ The
President alone is not the United States
under the Treaty Clause.
6. DECLARE WAR CLAUSE. Article I, sec-
tion 8, clause 11 empowers Congress alone to
take the nation from a state of peace to a
state of war. That power is non-delegable.
The Declare War Clause authors distrusted
the President to preserve the peace because
of the temptation to war to aggrandize exec-
utive power and earn a place in history. In
violation of the Declare War Clause, Presi-
dent Trump has continued to wage or has
initiated presidential wars in Libya, Soma-
lia, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and
Pakistan, and has used special forces offen-
sively in several African nations. President
Trump has claimed authority to initiate war
against any nation or non-state actor in the
world—not in self-defense-on his say-so
alone, including war against North Korea,
Iran, or Venezuela.
7. TAKE CARE CLAUSE; PRESENTMENT
CLAUSE. Article II, section 3 obligates the
President to ‘‘take care that the laws be
faithfully executed.’’ In violation of that
trust, President Donald J. Trump delib-
erately attempted to frustrate special coun-
sel Robert Mueller’s investigation of collabo-
ration between the Trump 2016 campaign and
Russia to influence the presidential election.
Among other things, the President refused to
answer specific questions relating to his
presidential conduct; endeavored to fire the
special counsel; dangled pardons for non-co-
operating witnesses; and, urged Attorney
General Jeff Sessions to reverse his recusal
decision to better protect his presidency. In
all these respects, the President was at-
tempting to obstruct justice.
President Trump has also systematically
declined to enforce statutory mandates of
Congress by arbitrarily and capriciously re-
voking scores of agency rules ranging from
immigration to the Consumer Financial Pro-
tection Board to the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency in violation of the Administra-
tive Procedure Act or otherwise. He has rou-
tinely legislated by executive order in lieu of
following constitutionally prescribed proc-
esses for legislation.
In violation of his constitutional duty to
take care that the laws be faithfully exe-
cuted, Mr. Trump has dismantled and dis-
abled scores of preventive measures to save
lives, avoid injuries or disease, help families,
consumers, and workers, and detect, deter,
and punish tens of billions of dollars of cor-
porate fraud. He has disputed climate disrup-
tion as a ‘‘Chinese hoax,’’ compounded the
climate crisis by overt actions that expand
greenhouse gas emissions and pollution, and
excluded or marginalized the influence of
civil service scientists.
Article I, section 7, clause 2, as President
George Washington explained, requires the
President either to sign or veto a bill passed
by Congress in toto. The President may not
exercise a line-item veto, as the United
States Supreme Court held in Clinton v. New
York, 524 U.S. 417 (1998). President Trump,
however, like several of his predecessors
commonly exercises the equivalent of uncon-
stitutional line-item vetoes through signing
statements declaring his intent to leave
unexecuted provisions he decrees are uncon-
stitutional without a court test. Presidential
signing statements weaken legislative power
by disarming Congress from bundling in a
single bill provisions both liked and disliked
by the President and forcing the White
House to choose between all or none. During
the administration of President George W.
Bush, an American Bar Association Task
Force issued a report condemning signing
statements as unconstitutional sent to the
President himself. ABA Task Force on Presi-
dential Signing Statements and the Separa-
tion of Powers Doctrine, August 2006.
8. DUE PROCESS CLAUSE. The Fifth
Amendment provides that no person shall
‘‘be deprived of life . . . without due process
of law.’’ In violation of due process, Presi-
dent Trump claims power, like his imme-
diate two predecessors, to act as prosecutor,
judge, jury, and executioner to kill Amer-
ican citizens or non-citizens alike, on or off
a battlefield, whether or not engaged in hos-
tilities, whether or not accused of crime, and
whether or not posing an imminent threat of
harm that would trigger a right of preemp-
tive self-defense. This combination of powers
are euphemistically referenced as ‘‘targeted
killings,’’ but they define tyranny.
9. APPOINTMENTS CLAUSE. President
Trump has repeatedly appointed principal of-
ficers of the United States, including the Na-
tional Security Advisor and Cabinet offi-
cials, who have not been confirmed by the
Senate in violation of the Appointments
Clause, Article II, section 2, clause 2. On a
scale never practiced by prior presidents, Mr.
Trump has filled as many as half of Cabinet
posts with ‘‘Acting Secretaries’’ who have
never been confirmed by the Senate.
10. SOLICITING A FOREIGN CONTRIBU-
TION FOR THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAM-
PAIGN AND BRIBERY. President Trump has
endeavored to corrupt the 2020 presidential
campaign by soliciting the President of
Ukraine to contribute something of value to
diminish the popularity of potential rival
Joe Biden, i.e., a Ukrainian investigation of
Mr. Biden and his son Hunter relating to po-
tential corrupt practices of Burisma, which
compensated Hunter handsomely ($50,000 per
month). In so doing, Mr. Trump violated the
criminal campaign finance prohibition set
forth in 52 U.S.C. 30121.
President Trump solicited a bribe for him-
self in violation of 18 U.S.C. 201 in seeking
something of personal value, i.e., discred-
iting Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign
with the help of the President of Ukraine to
influence Mr. Trump’s official decision to re-
lease approximately $400 million in military
and related assistance.
11. VIOLATING CITIZEN PRIVACY. The
Fourth Amendment protects the right to be
let alone from government snooping, the
most cherished right among civilized people
as Justice Brandeis elaborated in Olmstead
v. United States, 277 U.W. 438 (1928) (dis-
senting opinion). Government spying on
Americans ordinarily requires a warrant
issued by a neutral magistrate based on
probable cause to believe crime is afoot.
President Trump, however, routinely vio-
lates the Fourth Amendment with
suspicionless surveillance of Americans for
non-criminal, foreign intelligence purposes
under Executive Order 12333 and aggressive
interpretations of the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act.
12. SUPPRESSION OF FREE SPEECH. The
major purpose of a free press protected by
the First Amendment is to expose govern-
ment lies or illegalities—to shine light on
the dark side. Justice Hugo Black elaborated
in New York Times v. United States, 403 US.
713 (1971) in protecting publication of the
classified Pentagon Papers from suppression:
‘‘The Government’s power to censor the
press was abolished so that the press would
remain forever free to censure the Govern-
ment. The press was protected so that it
could bare the secrets of government and in-
form the people. Only a free and unre-
strained press can effectively expose decep-
tion in government. And paramount among
the responsibilities of a free press is the duty
to prevent any part of the government from
deceiving the people and sending them off to
distant lands to die of foreign fevers and for-
eign shot and shell.’’
President Trump is violating the First
Amendment in stretching the Espionage Act
to prosecute publication of leaked classified
information that are instrumental to expos-
ing government lies and deterring govern-
ment wrongdoing or misadventures, includ-
ing the outstanding indictment against Ju-
lian Assange for publishing information
which was republished by the New York
Times and The Washington Post with impu-
nity. The United States Supreme Court
upheld the First Amendment rights of the
New York Times and The Washington Post
to publish the classified Pentagon Papers,
which accelerated the conclusion of the dis-
astrous Vietnam War, in New York Times v.
United States.
In all of this, Donald J. Trump, since the
day of his inauguration, has conducted the
office of the President contrary to his oath
of office to destroy constitutional govern-
ment to the great prejudice of the cause of
law and justice and to the manifest injury of
the people of the United States.
Wherefore Donald J. Trump warrants im-
peachment and trial, and removal from of-
fice.
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam
Speaker, as we vote today, I think it is instruc-
tive that Americans reflect on how we got to
this point. The impeachment of Donald J.
Trump has largely been brought on by the
President himself.
The President took two specific actions: he
directly solicited a foreign government to gath-
er information on his political opponent. He
then further sought to promote a false nar-
rative that it was Ukraine, and not Russia, who
interfered with the elections in 2016. With the
ability to correct the record, clear his name, or
offer explanation for his actions, he chose in-
stead to obstruct a co-equal branch of govern-
ment from performing its Constitutional re-
sponsibilities of oversight and review. He did
this by refusing testimony, ignoring Congres-
sional subpoenas, and not providing Congress
with any pertinent information or data.
Today we’re putting Russia and other adver-
saries on notice, don’t interfere with our elec-
tions. Russia tried to divide the country in
2016, but they only succeed if America turns
away from the rule of law.
Some Republicans have excused the Presi-
dent’s behavior by saying, ‘‘Donald Trump isn’t
a politician, he’s a businessman. This is
Trump being Trump, this how he’s used to
doing business.’’
That very well may be true, but in a con-
stitutional democracy, no one, including Don-
ald Trump, is above the law.
I realize there are people who feel strongly
and differently than I do, but to do nothing, to

take no vote, is in essence condoning this be-
havior that disregards our Constitution. Repub-
licans may see today differently, but as we
look forward, we must stand united as a Con-
gress in defending our democracy.
For a democracy to work in a system of
check and balances, no one is above the law.
The President takes an oath of allegiance to
the United States Constitution; there are no
exceptions for the art of the deal.
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam Speak-
er, there have been quite a few comments
from the other side about how this is partisan,
and this is an attack, and we’re coming after
Donald Trump.
I don’t like this President. I don’t like his val-
ues, or his decision making, nor his policies or
the words he chooses to use. But these arti-
cles are not about a man. They are about the
ACTIONS of a man. They are about the ways
in which someone elected to the highest office
in this country abused that office, and violated
the basic tenets of the constitutional balance
of power.
I don’t want him to serve two terms, but this
is about that. This is about holding the Presi-
dent of the United States, whoever he may be,
to the standards and expectations of that of-
fice.
I say that genuinely. I would take this same
vote for any President who abused his office
in that way. And any member of this body who
fails to understand what this vote really
means—making clear what we expect of the
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, not the person
sitting in it—is deeply and horribly mistaken.
Anyone who fights for democratic values,
who values the balance of power, who wants
to ensure the underpinnings of the greatest
democracy in the world remain strong for gen-
erations to come, will support these articles of
impeachment as I intend to do.
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, as a citizen of
the United States of America, the greatest ex-
periment in democracy that our world has ever
known, as the duly elected U.S. House Rep-
resentative of my home communities of the
Coachella Valley, San Gorgonio Pass, and the
San Jacinto Pass in California’s 36th Congres-
sional District, and as the father to two young
daughters growing up in this great nation, I
rise today in support of impeaching the Presi-
dent of the United States, Donald J. Trump.
By conditioning $391 million in military aid to
a foreign ally on an investigation into his polit-
ical rival, Donald Trump abused the power of
the presidency for personal political gain. He
then obstructed Congress in its constitutionally
mandated oversight role. In doing so, Presi-
dent Trump violated our Constitution, com-
promised our national security, and under-
mined the integrity of our democratic process.
This was a principled decision made with
great reverence for the Constitution, in the
best interest of our nation, and without par-
tisan consideration. I was compelled by the
overwhelming evidence and the sacred oath I
took to preserve, protect, and defend the Con-
stitution—and by nature, our very democracy.
When Benjamin Franklin was leaving Inde-
pendence Hall at the close of the Constitu-
tional Convention in 1787, he was asked
whether America would be a republic or a
monarchy, and his response was, ‘‘A republic,
if you can keep it.’’
By voting in favor of impeachment today, I
am voting to keep it.
Benjamin Franklin and the Founding Fathers
envisioned the tragic scenario we are wit-
nessing at this moment in history: The Presi-
dent of the United States abusing the power of
the office with a foreign country for personal
political gain.
They gave us a constitutional remedy.
They gave us this remedy because the Con-
stitution is not a self-preserving document. It
needs people who will protect and defend it.
History must reflect that there are people
taking that oath of office seriously and fighting
to keep our Republic intact; that there are
people who are defending the Constitution and
fighting for the integrity of our Democratic
process; that there are people who say that
any President—regardless of political party—
who abuses the power of their high office for
personal gain will be held accountable.
It is important for me, for my daughters, Sky
and Sage, for my grandchildren, my great
grandchildren, and future generations; it is im-
portant for future leaders, future Congresses,
and for the historical record; it is important for
the ideals of the Constitution and the core of
our Republic that I solemnly cast my vote
today in favor of impeaching President Donald
Trump.
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise in support of H. Res. 755, a resolution
Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of
the United States, for high crimes and mis-
demeanors. Today is indeed a solemn day for
the United States of America.
The two Articles of Impeachment, as written
and passed by the House Judiciary Com-
mittee, outline the findings of the investiga-
tions done by several committees of jurisdic-
tion, charged with the constitutionally-man-
dated task of finding out the truth.
The truth is the President abused his power
of office by obstructing the impeachment in-
quiry; solicited the interference of the Ukraine
Government in the 2020 U.S. presidential
election in an attempt to undermine our elec-
tions; and posed a threat to national security
for political gain.
Madam Speaker, I have listened to and spo-
ken with my constituents in my district and
throughout the state of Texas. The corrupt
pattern of evidence is overwhelming. There-
fore, I am voting in favor of H. Res. 755, a
resolution Impeaching Donald John Trump,
President of the United States, for high crimes
and misdemeanors.
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, it
is a fundamental ideal of our republic that
every American receives justice under the law.
As a Member of this body, we are required to
uphold that ideal, and as a former judge, I was
tasked with the same responsibility. What I
have seen throughout this impeachment proc-
ess is far from justice.
In fact, this process has lacked impartiality,
respect for the United States Constitution, and
fairness. When I was on the bench, I in-
structed every jury the same way. I told them
that ‘‘what someone heard from another
source other than what they directly observed
is not evidence.’’ Rumors and hearsay are not
evidence under our laws, and it certainly
shouldn’t qualify as evidence in this chamber.
The evidence presented by the Majority in this
case is entirely hearsay and therefore, should
be inadmissible. In fact, the only direct evi-
dence presented to this body is the transcript
of President Trump’s telephone call with the
Ukraine President.
The Constitution is clear—treason, bribery,
high crimes and misdemeanors are impeach-
able offenses, and the evidence presented
does not meet those standards. Impeachment
is one of the most serious acts that Congress
will undertake. It is not to be taken lightly or
to be used as a political weapon against those
you disagree with, but unfortunately, that is
where we find ourselves today. For that rea-
son, I will not support the articles of impeach-
ment and I also ask my colleagues to reflect
on one thing: in light of what you have ob-
served about the process used to charge the
President, are we upholding justice?
I think not.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise to
discuss an issue of solemn, national impor-
tance. The impeachment of a president of the
United States is not a step we take lightly, nor
with anything but the seriousness it demands.
But, we take it, because it is our duty to up-
hold our oath of office, the Constitution, and
the trust that our constituents and the Amer-
ican people place in us. That is why I am vot-
ing for the articles of impeachment.
President Donald Trump’s actions are a
dangerous departure from his oath of office
and his duty to uphold the Constitution. As
with many of my colleagues, I was reluctant to
call for impeachment because I feared it would
further divide our country, be perceived as
overturning the 2016 election, and go to the
United States Senate where Republicans
would acquit President Trump regardless of
the evidence. But the President’s unchecked
actions gave the Congress no other choice.
Today, the House of Representatives is up-
holding its duty to protect the Constitution of
the United States. Our founders set up a sys-
tem of checks and balances, separation of
powers, and rule of law so that no person
would be above the law. That includes the
President of the United States. The Constitu-
tional recourse for ‘‘treason, bribery, or other
high crimes and misdemeanors’’ is clear: im-
peachment. It is a heavy price—intended only
for matters of grave consequence to our re-
public. President Trump’s actions meet that
high bar, and that is why I am voting in favor
of the articles of impeachment.
The facts of the case against President
Trump are indisputable. On July 25, 2019,
President Trump called Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelensky and asked him to ‘‘look
into’’ 2020 Presidential candidate Vice Presi-
dent Joe Biden and his son—an investigation
solely for his own personal and political gain.
In the weeks leading up to that call, the Presi-
dent withheld Congressionally-appropriated
foreign aid to Ukraine, as well as a meeting
between the two countries’ presidents in the
White House, as leverage. The President’s
abuse of power has been corroborated before
the Congress by brave public servants over
the last few months.
Facing a Congressional investigation into
these matters, President Trump ‘‘directed the
unprecedented, categorical, and indiscriminate
defiance of subpoenas issued by the House of
Representatives pursuant to its ’sole Power of
Impeachment.’’’ In doing so, President Trump
obstructed Congress’s Constitutionally-author-
ized investigation.
So, today, I will vote to uphold my responsi-
bility, outlined in the oath I have taken and the
Constitution. I will vote for the articles of im-
peachment.
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I did not
come to Congress to impeach the President.
But, I swore an oath to protect our country

and defend the constitution. That is why,
today, I will vote to approve two articles of im-
peachment against this President for abuse of
power and obstruction of Congress.
In order to arrive at that solemn and somber
conclusion, I used many of the same skills
that I acquired early on as a former pros-
ecutor. By putting politics and emotions aside
to focus on the underlying evidence and ap-
plying those facts to the articles of impeach-
ment, I found it clear that the President sub-
verted our national interest for his own per-
sonal and political interest. The President then
repeatedly ignored and refused to cooperate
with the numerous requests and subpoenas of
the investigation by Congress. Moreover, the
President proudly admitted this conduct and
refuses to acknowledge that he did anything
wrong.
I do not take pride in impeaching a sitting
president of the United States. But as the U.S.
Representative for the central coast of Cali-
fornia, I am upholding my obligation under the
United States Constitution and to protect the
future of our democracy.
The impeachment of the President and his
upcoming trial in the U.S. Senate will not stop
us from getting things done. As I have proven
during my limited time in Congress, I will con-
tinue to work on and pass legislation that re-
forms our immigration laws, especially for
Dreamers and farmworkers, promotes our ag-
riculture, combats the effects of climate
change, improves our health care system, low-
ers prescription drug prices, changes the tax
code to help the middle class and small busi-
nesses, defends equal rights, and protects our
values and way of life on the Central Coast.
Mr. GOLDEN. Madam Speaker, when I took
the oath of office in January, I entered Con-
gress prepared to work with President Trump
whenever possible and to stand up to him
whenever necessary. In my first year, I have
ranked among the top five of 235 House
Democrats in voting with the president. In a
deeply divided and partisan Congress, the op-
portunities for agreement have often felt lim-
ited, but I have sought in good faith to work
with him as best I can.
Since January, I have received many phone
calls and letters from constituents calling upon
me to support efforts to impeach the president
for a wide range of reasons. I have resisted
those efforts and maintained that the impeach-
ment of the President of the United States
must be considered as a last resort, reserved
only for the most serious crimes and constitu-
tional abuses.
Earlier this year, upon the conclusion of
Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investiga-
tion, I determined that there was no evidence
that the president had committed an impeach-
able offense, and as a result I opposed calls
for his impeachment. In my view, the Special
Counsel’s report identified a pattern of conduct
beneath the office of the presidency, specifi-
cally: poor judgement, efforts to exert undue
influence over an investigation, and attempts
to obstruct justice. However, in reviewing the
available facts, I did not find sufficient informa-
tion to support impeachment principally be-
cause the Special Counsel did not find ade-
quate evidence that the president or his cam-
paign team were involved in a conspiracy to
collude or coordinate with Russian efforts to
interfere with U.S. elections. It was my per-
sonal judgement that the president’s efforts to
impede the investigation did not meet the
threshold for launching impeachment pro-
ceedings.
What mattered most in my assessment of
the Special Counsel’s report was whether or
not the Trump campaign coordinated with
Russia to interfere in our elections—actions
that, if proven, would have crossed a clear red
line. This concern was rooted in the history of
our nation, for there is no doubt that the
Founders were fearful of foreign influence in
our domestic affairs. In Federalist No. 68,
Alexander Hamilton wrote:
‘‘Nothing was more to be desired than that
every practicable obstacle should be opposed
to cabal, intrigue, and corruption. These most
deadly adversaries of republican government
might naturally have been expected to make
their approaches from more than one quarter,
but chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to
gain an improper ascendant in our councils
[emphasis added]. How could they better grat-
ify this, than by raising a creature of their own
to the chief magistracy of the Union?’’
Our Framers also understood that impeach-
ment may be necessary to protect American
elections. During the Constitutional Conven-
tion, James Madison argued that waiting for
an election to vote a president out of office
might not be a sufficient safeguard, because
the president ‘‘might betray his trust to foreign
powers.’’ Similarly, in debating the need to in-
clude a procedure for impeachment in the
Constitution, the Framers conceived of how a
president might abuse his power in order to
win an election. George Mason asked the
Constitutional Convention, ‘‘Shall the man who
has practiced corruption, and by that means
procured his appointment in the first instance,
be suffered to escape punishment by repeat-
ing his guilt?’’
I have argued previously that to the extent
that my constituents consider the president’s
actions, most of them believe that the future of
our country’s leadership and direction should
be determined at the ballot box in 2020. I con-
tinue to believe that sentiment, but in order for
my constituents to voice their opinions on the
direction of the country, the security of the
2020 presidential election must be guaran-
teed, and the integrity of the election must be
without question. That is why I find the presi-
dent’s most recent actions with regard to
Ukraine and the upcoming election deeply
troubling and unacceptable.
In evaluating the president’s actions, I have
consulted the statements of the Founders and
of members of Congress who spoke during
previous impeachment hearings. I have stud-
ied the late law professor Charles Black’s
monograph Impeachment: A Handbook, writ-
ten at the height of Watergate. I have consid-
ered carefully the depositions of key wit-
nesses, watched hours of the testimony pro-
vided in public hearings, and carefully listened
to the questions and statements of my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle. The length
of my process has frustrated some of my con-
stituents, but on a matter of such gravity, I
have felt a responsibility to take the time nec-
essary to gather all available information be-
fore making a decision.
Here is what we know: in September, the
White House released a call summary show-
ing that on July 25, 2019, just one day after
the Special Counsel presented his findings
about the 2016 election to Congress, Presi-
dent Trump solicited the Government of
Ukraine to publicly announce investigations
into a political opponent, former Vice President
Joe Biden. The president requested this inves-
tigation despite the fact that officials in both
the United States and Ukraine have rejected
the accusations as baseless.
The president’s intent in the July 25 phone
call is clear. He specifically references both
the former vice president and his son, Hunter
Biden. We also know from depositions taken
as part of the House impeachment inquiry that
the president’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani,
was concurrently demanding that Ukrainian of-
ficials publicly announce investigations into
Burisma, the company where Hunter Biden
served as a board member, before the White
House would agree to arrange a meeting be-
tween President Trump and the new Ukrainian
president. Key members of the Trump Admin-
istration’s diplomatic corps testified under oath
that this head of state meeting was contingent
upon the announcement Of these politically-
motivated investigations.
The House investigation clearly unearthed a
pattern of evidence that demonstrates the cor-
rupt intent on the part of the president, his
personal lawyer, and members of his adminis-
tration to leverage the powers of the presi-
dency to damage a political opponent and
strengthen the president’s reelection pros-
pects. Given that the sought-after investigation
was solicited from a foreign government, the
president’s actions are a realization of the
Framers’ greatest fears: foreign corruption of
our electoral process, and a president willing
to leverage the powers of his office to benefit
his own reelection. This action crossed a clear
red line, and in my view, there is no doubt that
this is an impeachable act. For this reason, I
will vote for Article I of the House resolution to
impeach President Trump for an abuse of
power.
I did not reach this conclusion lightly. Al-
though I find that there is indisputable evi-
dence that the president solicited the inter-
ference of a foreign government in the 2020
U.S. presidential election, I believe that the
burden of proof for part of the first article, that
the president withheld military assistance to
Ukraine in order to secure the investigation of
Vice President Biden, will be harder to meet in
a Senate trial. While I believe it is reasonable
to conclude there is sufficient evidence to sup-
port the other charges in Article I and justify
sending an indictment to the Senate for trial,
I also regret that the House did not package
the charge regarding the military aid as a sep-
arate article, rather than combining it with the
president’s direct solicitation of a foreign in-
vestigation into his political rival.
I have advocated for this change to Article
I to House leadership, in part because I be-
lieve it would provide for clearer debate in the
Senate and among the general public. Why
exactly the Trump Administration withheld mili-
tary aid from Ukraine is a question on which
reasonable minds—looking at the same set of
facts—may reach different conclusions. But
there is no such room for disagreement on
one stark fact: the President of the United
States asked a foreign government to aid in
his reelection by soliciting an investigation of
his political opponent based upon trumped-up
charges. Our Founders feared exactly this sit-
uation, a president willing to illegitimately wield
the powers of his office against his political
opponents in order to secure his reelection. As
North Carolina’s William Davie remarked at
the 1787 Constitutional Convention, ‘‘If he be

not impeachable whilst in office, he will spare
no efforts or means whatever to get himself
reelected.’’
Article II of the resolution presents a sepa-
rate charge, that the president ‘‘without lawful
cause or excuse,’’ obstructed the congres-
sional inquiry into his actions. While I do not
dispute that the White House has been pro-
vocative in its defiance and sweeping in its
claims of executive privilege, I also believe
there are legitimate and unresolved constitu-
tional questions about the limits of executive
privilege, and that before pursuing impeach-
ment for this charge, the House has an obliga-
tion to exhaust all other available options.
It is important to note that the House has
not attempted to enforce subpoenas for key
witnesses to the charges before the president,
including those issued to Mick Mulvaney, John
Eisenberg, and Russell Vought. The House
has also failed to issue subpoenas to other
key witnesses, like John Bolton and Rick
Perry. In fact, because of a political decision
to wrap up impeachment proceedings as
quickly as possible, the House recently with-
drew a subpoena for Charles Kupperman, a
senior aide to John Bolton, and House coun-
sel asked a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit
that would clarify Mr. Kupperman’s obligation
to testify.
At the heart of this matter is a debate about
the limits of the president’s executive privilege,
especially in the face of subpoenas issued by
congressional committees conducting an im-
peachment inquiry. Professor Black has ar-
gued that executive privilege has a stronger
claim in the earlier stages of the impeachment
process, but that by the time of a Senate trial,
it should be clearer what specific information
is necessary for Congress to conclude its pro-
ceedings.
I believe that the House must exercise as
much restraint as possible in order to avoid
setting a dangerous precedent for the future.
On the one hand, each of the two political par-
ties has an interest in protecting the executive
privilege of the White House; there are some
communications that should remain confiden-
tial, or at the very least not be released pub-
licly in order to protect our national security.
On the other hand, the White House has
made broad and in my view excessive claims
regarding executive privilege, declaring as
early as April of this year that it would contest
‘‘all the subpoenas’’ and arguing that Con-
gress is powerless to force the White House
to comply.
This tension is precisely why our system of
government provides for a forum in which dis-
putes between the executive and the legisla-
ture over the scope of their respective privi-
leges and powers can be resolved. That forum
is the judicial branch. The House can—and in
other contexts has—gone to the courts to en-
force committee subpoenas. Before wielding
our awesome power to impeach a sitting
president, we first ought to exhaust available
judicial remedies, or—at the very least—give
the courts a chance. If the president were to
defy a court order to produce documents or to
give testimony in an impeachment inquiry, or
if he were to encourage his subordinates to do
the same, then a charge of obstruction would
be appropriate. But while the president’s re-
sistance toward our investigative efforts has
been frustrating, it has not yet, in my view,
reached the threshold of ‘‘high crime or mis-
demeanor’’ that the Constitution demands. For
that reason, I will vote against Article II of the
House resolution regarding obstruction of Con-
gress.
To my constituents: please know that I am
deeply dismayed by the circumstances sur-
rounding this inquiry, likely impeachment, and
coming trial of the president. Indeed, my con-
cerns about our politics and the health of our
democracy have only grown over the course
of this process. The divisiveness of this im-
peachment inquiry has been terrible for our
country, just as the Framers knew it would be.
I also believe, however, that the president’s ef-
forts to solicit a foreign government’s involve-
ment in our upcoming election to undermine a
political opponent represents a clear and im-
minent threat to our democracy that cannot go
unchecked. I see it as my duty to vote in sup-
port of Article I in order to send a clear mes-
sage to the president, to the country, and to
the world that foreign interference in American
elections is not acceptable, not welcomed, and
will not be tolerated. In the end, I believe the
failure of Congress to act in a bipartisan fash-
ion to send this message may represent the
greatest threat of all to the health of our de-
mocracy.
Earlier this year, I expressed my concern
that a partisan impeachment would further
deepen the political divisions in this country,
and that the best recourse would be to rely on
our electoral process to litigate our dif-
ferences. But in this current moment, when
the subject of the president’s actions has been
to corrupt that very process, relying on the
next election cannot be the solution. As I
square those concerns with our current mo-
ment, I take solace in the words of a previous
congressman from Maine’s Second District
who also confronted an impeachment vote
during his first term in office. Concerned with
the divisive impact of impeachment on the
country, then-Congressman William Cohen ob-
served:
It has been said that impeachment pro-
ceedings will tear this country apart. To say
that it will tear the country apart is a propo-
sition I cannot accept. I think what would tear
the country apart would be to turn our backs
on the facts and our responsibilities to ascer-
tain them. That in my opinion would do far
more to start the unraveling of the fabrics of
this country and the Constitution than would a
strong reaffirmation of that great document.
In the face of the evidence before me today,
I believe Cohen’s words still ring true—but
only if we commit ourselves not to become
mired in this current sad chapter of deep par-
tisanship in American history. We must turn
our eyes to the future and look for ways to ad-
dress the needs of the country and our con-
stituents. We have made progress in the past
few days with the passage of important legis-
lation, like the National Defense Authorization
Act and the announcement of a budget deal
that keeps government open, accomplishes
important healthcare reforms, secures our bor-
ders, and funds our military. There remains
much more potential in the year ahead, if only
we are able to set aside our differences and
work together toward common ground for the
good of the country.
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I include in
the RECORD an open letter to my constituents:
This is a somber time in our country as the
House this week weighs articles of impeach-
ment against our President. It’s a vote that
no Member should ever want to take, and I
certainly did not. I ran for Congress to work
to lower the price of prescription drugs, to
fight for education funding and to help our
family farmers. And as your representative
that is what I’ve been focused on. I’m par-
ticularly proud that over two-thirds of my
nearly 340 bills are bipartisan and that I’ve
developed strong relationships across the
aisle that are leading to important legisla-
tive accomplishments.
When I was sworn into office this past Jan-
uary, I swore an oath to protect and defend
the Constitution of our great nation. That is
why in mid-September I called for an open
and transparent process to determine wheth-
er the President’s actions warrant articles,
and if they should receive a full trial in the
Senate.
On Friday morning, the House Judiciary
Committee voted to send the resolution on
Articles of Impeachment to the House Floor.
You deserve to hear from me directly in ad-
vance of my vote now that the Committee
work is complete.
After reviewing the public testimony from
non-partisan public servants and officials ap-
pointed to their roles by the President him-
self—as well as the final House Intelligence
Committee report—I have decided that this
week I will vote yes on both Articles of Im-
peachment.
No elected leader is above the law.
It is clear from the testimony and the re-
port delivered to Congress that the President
attempted to coerce a foreign government
into investigating his political rival by with-
holding Congressionally-appropriated mili-
tary assistance to a foreign ally. This is a
clear abuse of power by a sitting U.S. Presi-
dent for his own personal gain. It is also
clear that the President obstructed Congress
by refusing to produce documents and block-
ing testimony during the impeachment in-
quiry, which is against the law.
My values would require the same vote if
this were a Democratic President. It is about
protecting our democratic values, about
right and wrong, and about upholding my
oath to the Constitution and the rule of law.
Gratefully yours,
Rep. Angie Craig
MN–02
December 15, 2019.
Mr. HAGEDORN. Madam Speaker, many
members of this body have publicly voiced
support for impeachment since before this
President was sworn into office—some even
skipping the Inauguration, a time-honored
American tradition, because they viewed him
as an illegitimate President.
For a significant number of my colleagues,
this will not be the first—and possibly not even
the last time they vote to impeach President
Trump. Several have openly admitted they are
concerned if they don’t vote to impeach the
President, he will be reelected.
Even the highest-ranking member of this
body publicly stated that this process has
been two and a half years in the making. The
Speaker admitted this just months after she
told the American people that impeachment
would need to be compelling, overwhelming
and bipartisan. Yet, the only thing bipartisan
about this impeachment is the opposition to it.
Here are the facts:
Both President Trump and President
Zelensky say there was no pressure.
The call transcript shows no conditionality—
or ‘‘quid pro quo’’—between aid and an inves-
tigation.
The Ukrainians were not aware that aid was
withheld when Trump and Zelensky spoke.
Ukraine did not open an investigation, and still
received aid and a meeting with President
Trump.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H12202 December 18, 2019
The sad truth is that this has been an overt-
ly political process from the very beginning,
and an unwarranted attempt to remove our
duly elected President from office. I will vote
‘‘no’’ and I urge my colleagues on both sides
of the aisle to vote against this divisive im-
peachment.
I include in the Record a letter from Presi-
dent Trump to Speaker PELOSI.
THE WHITE HOUSE,
Washington, December 17, 2019.
Hon. NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker of the House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: I write to express
my strongest and most powerful protest
against the partisan impeachment crusade
being pursued by the Democrats in the House
of Representatives. This impeachment rep-
resents an unprecedented and unconstitu-
tional abuse of power by Democrat Law-
makers, unequaled in nearly two and a half
centuries of American legislative history.
The Articles of Impeachment introduced
by the House Judiciary Committee are not
recognizable under any standard of Constitu-
tional theory, interpretation, or jurispru-
dence. They include no crimes, no mis-
demeanors, and no offenses whatsoever. You
have cheapened the importance of the very
ugly word, impeachment!
By proceeding with your invalid impeach-
ment, you are violating your oaths of office,
you are breaking your allegiance to the Con-
stitution, and you are declaring open war on
American Democracy. You dare to invoke
the Founding Fathers in pursuit of this elec-
tion-nullification scheme—yet your spiteful
actions display unfettered contempt for
America’s founding and your egregious con-
duct threatens to destroy that which our
Founders pledged their very lives to build.
Even worse than offending the Founding Fa-
thers, you are offending Americans of faith
by continually saying ‘‘I pray for the Presi-
dent,’’ when you know this statement is not
true, unless it is meant in a negative sense.
It is a terrible thing you are doing, but you
will have to live with it, not I!
Your first claim, ‘‘Abuse of Power,’’ is a
completely disingenuous, meritless, and
baseless invention of your imagination. You
know that I had a totally innocent conversa-
tion with the President of Ukraine. I then
had a second conversation that has been mis-
quoted, mischaracterized, and fraudulently
misrepresented. Fortunately, there was a
transcript of the conversation taken, and
you know from the transcript (which was im-
mediately made available) that the para-
graph in question was perfect. I said to
President Zelensky: ‘‘I would like you to do
us a favor, though, because our country has
been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot
about it.’’ I said do us a favor, not me, and
our country, not a campaign. I then men-
tioned the Attorney General of the United
States. Every time I talk with a foreign lead-
er, I put America’s interests first, just as I
did with President Zelensky.
You are turning a policy disagreement be-
tween two branches of government into an
impeachable offense—it is no more legiti-
mate than the Executive Branch charging
members of Congress with crimes for the
lawful exercise of legislative power.
You know full well that Vice President
Biden used his office and $1 billion dollars of
U.S. aid money to coerce Ukraine into firing
the prosecutor who was digging into the
company paying his son millions of dollars.
You know this because Biden bragged about
it on video. Biden openly stated: ‘‘I said, ‘I’m
telling you, you’re not getting the billion
dollars’ . . . I looked at them and said: ‘I’m
leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not
fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well,
son of a bitch. He got fired.’’ Even Joe Biden
admitted just days ago in an interview with
NPR that it ‘‘looked bad.’’ Now you are try-
ing to impeach me by falsely accusing me of
doing what Joe Biden has admitted he actu-
ally did.
President Zelensky has repeatedly de-
clared that I did nothing wrong, and that
there was No Pressure. He further empha-
sized that it was a ‘‘good phone call,’’ that ‘‘I
don’t feel pressure,’’ and explicitly stressed
that ‘‘nobody pushed me.’’ The Ukrainian
Foreign Minister stated very clearly: ‘‘I have
never seen a direct link between investiga-
tions and security assistance.’’ He also said
there was ‘‘No Pressure.’’ Senator Ron John-
son of Wisconsin, a supporter of Ukraine who
met privately with President Zelensky, has
said: ‘‘At no time during this meeting . . .
was there any mention by Zelensky or any
Ukrainian that they were feeling pressure to
do anything in return for the military aid.’’
Many meetings have been held between rep-
resentatives of Ukraine and our country.
Never once did Ukraine complain about pres-
sure being applied—not once! Ambassador
Sandland testified that I told him: ‘‘No quid
pro quo. I want nothing. I want nothing. I
want President Zelensky to do the right
thing, do what he ran on.’’
The second claim, so-called ‘‘Obstruction
of Congress,’’ is preposterous and dangerous.
House Democrats are trying to impeach the
duly elected President of the United States
for asserting Constitutionally based privi-
leges that have been asserted on a bipartisan
basis by administrations of both political
parties throughout our Nation’s history.
Under that standard, every American presi-
dent would have been impeached many times
over. As liberal law professor Jonathan
Turley warned when addressing Congres-
sional Democrats: ‘‘I can’t emphasize this
enough . . . if you impeach a president, if
you make a high crime and misdemeanor out
of going to the courts, it is an abuse of
power. It’s your abuse of power. You’re doing
precisely what you’re criticizing the Presi-
dent for doing.’’
Everyone, you included, knows what is
really happening. Your chosen candidate lost
the election in 2016, in an Electoral College
landslide (306–227), and you and your party
have never recovered from this defeat. You
have developed a full-fledged case of what
many in the media call Trump Derangement
Syndrome and sadly, you will never get over
it! You are unwilling and unable to accept
the verdict issued at the ballot box during
the great Election of 2016. So you have spent
three straight years attempting to overturn
the will of the American people and nullify
their votes. You view democracy as your
enemy!
Speaker Pelosi, you admitted just last
week at a public forum that your party’s im-
peachment effort has been going on for ‘‘two
and a half years,’’ long before you ever heard
about a phone call with Ukraine. Nineteen
minutes after I took the oath of office, the
Washington Post published a story head-
lined. ‘‘The Campaign to Impeach President
Trump Has Begun.’’ Less than three months
after my inauguration, Representative Max-
ine Waters stated. ‘‘I’m going to fight every
day until he’s impeached.’’ House Democrats
introduced the first impeachment resolution
against me within months of my inaugura-
tion, for what will be regarded as one of our
country’s best decisions, the firing of James
Corney (see Inspector General Reports)—who
the world now knows is one of the dirtiest
cops our Nation has ever seen. A ranting and
raving Congresswoman, Rashida Tlaib, de-
clared just hours after she was sworn into of-
fice, ‘‘We’re gonna go in there and we’re
gonna impeach the motherf****r.’’ Rep-
resentative Al Green said in May, ‘‘I’m con-
cerned that if we don’t impeach this presi-
dent. he will get re-elected.’’ Again. you and
your allies said, and did, all of these things
long before you ever heard of President
Zelensky or anything related to Ukraine. As
you know very well. this impeachment drive
has nothing to do with Ukraine, or the to-
tally appropriate conversation I had with its
new president. It only has to do with your
attempt to undo the election of 2016 and
steal the election of 2020!
Congressman Adam Schiff cheated and lied
all the way up to the present day, even going
so far as to fraudulently make up, out of
thin air. my conversation with President
Zelensky of Ukraine and read this fantasy
language to Congress as though it were said
by me. His shameless lies and deceptions,
dating all the way back to the Russia Hoax,
is one of the main reasons we are here today.
You and your party are desperate to dis-
tract from America’s extraordinary econ-
omy, incredible jobs boom, record stock mar-
ket, soaring confidence, and flourishing citi-
zens. Your party simply cannot compete
with our record: 7 million new jobs; the low-
est-ever unemployment for African Ameri-
cans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Ameri-
cans: a rebuilt military: a completely re-
formed VA with Choice and Accountability
for our great veterans; more than 170 new
federal judges and two Supreme Court Jus-
tices: historic tax and regulation cuts; the
elimination of the individual mandate; the
first decline in prescription drug prices in
half a century; the first new branch of the
United States Military since 1947, the Space
Force; strong protection of the Second
Amendment; criminal justice reform; a de-
feated ISIS caliphate and the killing of the
world’s number one terrorist leader, al-
Baghdadi; the replacement of the disastrous
NAFTA trade deal with the wonderful
USMCA (Mexico and Canada); a break-
through Phase One trade deal with China;
massive new trade deals with Japan and
South Korea; withdrawal from the terrible
Iran Nuclear Deal; cancellation of the unfair
and costly Paris Climate Accord; becoming
the world’s top energy producer; recognition
of Israel’s capital, opening the American
Embassy in Jerusalem, and recognizing
Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights; a
colossal reduction in illegal border crossings,
the ending of Catch-and-Release, and the
building of the Southern Border Wall—and
that is just the beginning, there is so much
more. You cannot defend your extreme poli-
cies—open borders, mass migration, high
crime, crippling taxes, socialized healthcare,
destruction of American energy. late-term
taxpayer-funded abortion, elimination of the
Second Amendment. radical far-left theories
of law and justice, and constant partisan ob-
struction of both common sense and common
good.
There is nothing I would rather do than
stop referring to your party as the Do-Noth-
ing Democrats. Unfortunately, I don’t know
that you will ever give me a chance to do so.
After three years of unfair and unwar-
ranted investigations, 45 million dollars
spent, 18 angry Democrat prosecutors, the
entire force of the FBI, headed by leadership
now proven to be totally incompetent and
corrupt, you have found NOTHING! Few peo-
ple in high position could have endured or
passed this test. You do not know, nor do
you care, the great damage and hurt you
have inflicted upon wonderful and loving
members of my family. You conducted a fake
investigation upon the democratically elect-
ed President of the United States, and you
are doing it yet again.
There are not many people who could have
taken the punishment inflicted during this
period of time, and yet done so much for the

success of America and its citizens. But in-
stead of putting our country first, you have
decided to disgrace our country still further.
You completely failed with the Mueller re-
port because there was nothing to find, so
you decided to take the next hoax that came
along, the phone call with Ukraine—even
though it was a perfect call. And by the way,
when I speak to foreign countries, there are
many people, with permission, listening to
the call on both sides of the conversation.
You are the ones interfering in America’s
elections. You are the ones subverting Amer-
ica’s Democracy. You are the ones Obstruct-
ing Justice. You are the ones bringing pain
and suffering to our Republic for your own
selfish personal, political, and partisan gain.
Before the Impeachment Hoax, it was the
Russian Witch Hunt. Against all evidence,
and regardless of the truth, you and your
deputies claimed that my campaign colluded
with the Russians—a grave, malicious, and
slanderous lie, a falsehood like no other. You
forced our Nation through turmoil and tor-
ment over a wholly fabricated story, ille-
gally purchased from a foreign spy by Hil-
lary Clinton and the DNC in order to assault
our democracy. Yet, when the monstrous lie
was debunked and this Democrat conspiracy
dissolved into dust, you did not apologize.
You did not recant. You did not ask to be
forgiven. You showed no remorse, no capac-
ity for self-reflection. Instead, you pursued
your next libelous and vicious crusade—you
engineered an attempt to frame and defame
an innocent person. All of this was moti-
vated by personal political calculation. Your
Speakership and your party are held hostage
by your most deranged and radical rep-
resentatives of the far left. Each one of your
members lives in fear of a socialist primary
challenger—this is what is driving impeach-
ment. Look at Congressman Nadler’s chal-
lenger. Look at yourself and others. Do not
take our country down with your party.
If you truly cared about freedom and lib-
erty for our Nation, then you would be de-
voting your vast investigative resources to
exposing the full truth concerning the FBI’s
horrifying abuses of power before, during,
and after the 2016 election—including the use
of spies against my campaign, the submis-
sion of false evidence to a FISA court, and
the concealment of exculpatory evidence in
order to frame the innocent. The FBI has
great and honorable people, but the leader-
ship was inept and corrupt. I would think
that you would personally be appalled by
these revelations, because in your press con-
ference the day you announced impeach-
ment, you tied the impeachment effort di-
rectly to the completely discredited Russia
Hoax, declaring twice that ‘‘all roads lead to
Putin,’’ when you know that is an abject lie.
I have been far tougher on Russia than Presi-
dent Obama ever even thought to be.
Any member of Congress who votes in sup-
port of impeachment—against every shred of
truth, fact, evidence, and legal principle—is
showing how deeply they revile the voters
and how truly they detest America’s Con-
stitutional order. Our Founders feared the
tribalization of partisan politics, and you are
bringing their worst fears to life.
Worse still, I have been deprived of basic
Constitutional Due Process from the begin-
ning of this impeachment scam right up
until the present. I have been denied the
most fundamental rights afforded by the
Constitution, including the right to present
evidence, to have my own counsel present, to
confront accusers. and to call and cross-ex-
amine witnesses, like the so-called whistle-
blower who started this entire hoax with a
false report of the phone call that bears no
relationship to the actual phone call that
was made. Once I presented the transcribed
call, which surprised and shocked the
fraudsters (they never thought that such evi-
dence would be presented), the so-called
whistleblower, and the second whistleblower,
disappeared because they got caught, their
report was a fraud, and they were no longer
going to be made available to us. In other
words, once the phone call was made public,
your whole plot blew up, but that didn’t stop
you from continuing.
More due process was afforded to those ac-
cused in the Salem Witch Trials.
You and others on your committees have
long said impeachment must be bipartisan—
it is not. You said it was very divisive—it
certainly is, even far more than you ever
thought possible—and it will only get worse!
This is nothing more than an illegal, par-
tisan attempted coup that will, based on re-
cent sentiment, badly fail at the voting
booth. You are not just after me, as Presi-
dent, you are after the entire Republican
Party. But because of this colossal injustice,
our party is more united than it has ever
been before. History will judge you harshly
as you proceed with this impeachment cha-
rade. Your legacy will be that of turning the
House of Representatives from a revered leg-
islative body into a Star Chamber of par-
tisan persecution.
Perhaps most insulting of all is your false
display of solemnity. You apparently have so
little respect for the American People that
you expect them to believe that you are ap-
proaching this impeachment somberly, re-
servedly, and reluctantly. No intelligent per-
son believes what you are saying. Since the
moment I won the election, the Democrat
Party has been possessed by Impeachment
Fever. There is no reticence. This is not a
somber affair. You are making a mockery of
impeachment and you are scarcely con-
cealing your hatred of me, of the Republican
Party, and tens of millions of patriotic
Americans. The voters are wise, and they are
seeing straight through this empty, hollow,
and dangerous game you are playing.
I have no doubt the American people will
hold you and the Democrats fully responsible
in the upcoming 2020 election. They will not
soon forgive your perversion of justice and
abuse of power.
There is far too much that needs to be
done to improve the lives of our citizens. It
is time for you and the highly partisan
Democrats in Congress to immediately cease
this impeachment fantasy and get back to
work for the American People. While I have
no expectation that you will do so, I write
this letter to you for the purpose of history
and to put my thoughts on a permanent and
indelible record.
One hundred years from now, when people
look back at this affair, I want them to un-
derstand it, and learn from it, so that it can
never happen to another President again.
Sincerely yours,
DONALD J. TRUMP,
President of the United States of America.
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to op-
pose the articles of impeachment that have
been produced by this flawed process, which
was based on hearsay and testimony largely
collected from a closed-door, one-sided inves-
tigation.
In fact, the only witness we heard from who
had direct knowledge of the conversation in
question, testified that President Trump did not
want a quid pro quo and confirmed that the
aid to Ukraine was released without the
launching of any investigation that the Presi-
dent’s detractors say he was seeking.
The two articles of impeachment in the res-
olution—abuse of power and obstruction of
Congress—are broad and cite no specific
crimes that the President committed. The
House Democrats are basing the entire im-
peachment on hearsay testimonies grounded
on absolutely no evidence of a crime.
However, last week we had a look at some
real wrongdoing. We found out from the Jus-
tice Department’s Inspector General that the
investigation into whether President Trump
colluded with the Russians was based on
fraudulent information filed with the secret
court. The FBI was found to have withheld ex-
culpatory evidence and senior FBI leaders
were found to have manipulated facts in order
to support this false collusion narrative, justify
their investigation, and expand it. This hap-
pened on multiple occasions.
While the Mueller investigation found no col-
lusion, some Members of Congress, like
House Impeachment Leader ADAM SCHIFF,
knowingly promoted this falsehood and used
similar tactics to engineer this impeachment
inquiry. This is unacceptable.
For the above reason, I voted to censure
Chairman ADAM SCHIFF and will vote against
these articles of impeachment.
We know this impeachment is a sham. They
know this impeachment is a sham. They know
that we know it is a sham.
We all know this shameful impeachment
began the moment the President was elected,
long before he ever had a single telephone
call with any foreign government. We’ve heard
the numerous quotations by those on the
other side that validate that fact. And, yet the
other side persists in attempting to over-turn
the results of the legitimate election of Presi-
dent Donald J. Trump, because he dares to
drain a swamp to which they are beholden.
When the President calls for an investiga-
tion of corruption, the other side calls it
‘digging for dirt.’ When they dig for dirt, they
call it an ’investigation’.
This is a sad day for America. This im-
peachment is the worst case of partisan poli-
tics in the history of our Republic.
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, no one
enters Congress hoping to impeach the presi-
dent. But when duty demands it, we have no
other choice. Our founders included in the
Constitution a provision for impeachment, a
provision to be used only in the face of the
gravest threats to our democratic republic.
Deciding how to vote cannot be accurately
portrayed in tweets or sound bites, so I wel-
come the opportunity to explain my thoughts.
Unlike many others in the Democratic Party,
I was, at first, hesitant about impeachment. As
one of the few who predicted that Donald
Trump could win the election, I made clear
that I would work with him if he would help the
hard-working men and women of my district in
Michigan.
I worked with his team on lowering drug
prices, improving trade policies, addressing
the opioid crisis and updating major conserva-
tion efforts. We made progress in some areas.
I have also opposed many of this adminis-
tration’s positions, including threatening to
take away protections for people living with
pre-existing medical conditions, withdrawing
from the Paris climate agreement, instituting a
travel ban affecting Muslim-majority countries
and tearing families apart at the border.
These policies were wrong, but they were
not impeachable offenses. Our democracy
supports dissenting opinions, and I respect the
office of the presidency.
Pressure began early this year for me to call
for impeachment. The billionaire Tom Steyer

ran advertisements in The Detroit News and
The Detroit Free Press and on news websites
and social media calling for impeachment.
People in my district had strong opinions ev-
erywhere I went, from the grocery store and
farmers markets to church and my bagel
place.
At the time, my constituents were focused
on the Mueller report into Russian interference
in the 2016 election, which they hoped would
provide a case for impeachment. But it wasn’t
clear. What the report did reveal—a finding
that was often overlooked in the focus on the
Trump campaign’s contacts with Russians—is
that Moscow is trying to divide our country.
Then, in October, came reports that Mr.
Trump and his administration withheld con-
gressionally approved military aid to Ukraine
while asking for a foreign government to in-
vestigate one of his political rivals. An inspec-
tor general appointed by Mr. Trump found that
there was a credible, urgent and potentially
immediate threat to our national security.
No matter the party affiliation of the person
occupying the White House or the party of the
majority in Congress, our founders built our
Constitution on a system of three equal
branches of government, with very clear over-
sight responsibilities delegated to the Con-
gress. The whistle-blower report required Con-
gress to investigate the facts and follow the
issue.
News outlets seem to assume that House
Democrats and Republicans have been as ob-
sessed with impeachment as they are, and
that every single Democrat had her mind
made up from Day 1. But the truth is that
many of us on both sides have remained fo-
cused on kitchen-table issues that matter to
everyone.
While the House Intelligence and Judiciary
Committees undertook the job of gathering the
facts, House leaders and other committees
worked to lower prescription drug prices, pro-
tect the environment, restore voting rights to
citizens and devise trade deals that level the
playing field.
A vote as serious as impeaching the presi-
dent of the United States deserves thoughtful,
reflective and deliberate attention. Each day,
after attending my own committee hearings
and markups, meetings and events with con-
stituents, I would come home to start my own
studies on the impeachment inquiry.
I read testimonies from firsthand witnesses,
parsed the majority and dissenting opinions
from the committees’ reports and listened to
the voices on both sides. I spent weeks read-
ing the Constitution, constitutional scholars,
the Federalist Papers and papers from both
the Nixon and Clinton impeachment proc-
esses.
By the end, I was convinced: The facts
showed that President Trump and his adminis-
tration put politics over country by asking a
foreign government to investigate a political
rival while withholding military aid that affects
our national security.
Further evidence showed a clear obstruction
of Congress. Blocking key witnesses from the
administration from testifying and even intimi-
dating sitting witnesses sets a dangerous
precedent.
If we don’t address this abuse of power, we
abdicate our constitutional and moral responsi-
bility. Failing to address it would also condone
these actions as acceptable for future adminis-
trations.
Did President Trump’s actions rise to the
level of a threat to our democracy? Yes. Fu-
ture generations and historians will judge us if
we did not address these dangers. I will cast
my vote to protect our Constitution, our demo-
cratic republic and the future of our country.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker, in
1998, I voted for three of the four counts of
impeachment brought against President Clin-
ton. Those votes were some of the most dif-
ficult I have cast during my 25 years in Con-
gress. Impeachment is an extreme remedy,
which, in effect, alters a decision made by the
American people through an election. It was
clear, however, that President Clinton had lied
under oath in a judicial proceeding, a felony
crime for which other Americans are routinely
prosecuted and convicted. In my view, dis-
missing such a crime because the lies in-
volved private rather than public actions or be-
cause the perjurer was the President of the
United States would have undermined the rule
of law and presented a danger to our constitu-
tional system of government. Therefore, I
voted for three of the counts.
The count of impeachment that I voted
against in 1998 involved ‘‘abuse of power.’’ It
was essentially a repeat of the perjury recited
in other counts and a failure to provide infor-
mation to Congress. It was also one of two
counts that failed to receive a majority of the
votes on the Floor of the House.
In contrast to 1998, the votes I make today
are not difficult at all. After three years of in-
vestigating this President, House Democrats
center their case for impeachment on one
phone call between President Trump and the
President of Ukraine, a transcript of which has
been released.
I believe that aspects of that phone call,
particularly discussing an investigation of a po-
litical opponent, were inappropriate for a presi-
dent. I recognize that ignoring potentially cor-
rupt behavior because of political prominence
could lead to another set of problems. None-
theless, under the circumstances, I believe
that it would have been best if the President
had avoided such topics.
Inappropriate does not mean impeachable.
The Constitution sets a high standard for im-
peachable conduct: ‘‘Treason, Bribery, other
high Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’ (Article II,
Section 4) A potentially inappropriate con-
versation does not begin to approach that
standard, as the counts brought before us
today demonstrate.
Count one alleges ‘‘abuse of power,’’ the
same phrase rejected by the House in the
Clinton impeachment. The allegations relate to
the phone call, an investigation that was never
conducted, and a temporary delay in military
aid being released. In spite of a last-minute at-
tempt in the Judiciary Committee’s report to
allege some form of bribery, the evidence and
the law do not support the charge, and the
Committee made no serious attempt to prove
it. Instead, we are left with a nebulous, subjec-
tive phrase that can be used to cover any po-
litical or stylistic difference.
Count two alleges ‘‘obstruction of Con-
gress.’’ I find it remarkable that an impeach-
ment process which, in contrast to those prior,
has been totally partisan with no attempt at a
jointly-decided bipartisan process, would at-
tempt to impeach a president for resisting
such partisanship. In addition, I believe that it
is a mistake to essentially criminalize the in-
herent tensions between the legislative and
executive branches of government.
To describe these counts as ‘‘weak’’ over-
states them. A partisan process, designed
from the beginning to achieve a desired result,
brings to the Floor two counts that do not
begin to meet the constitutional standard for
impeachment, even if all of the facts alleged
are assumed true. It is a misuse—one might
say ‘‘abuse’’—of the Constitution’s impeach-
ment power.
One final concern: the partisan process
used in this case degrades established bound-
aries of political competition that have helped
this nation survive intense political differences
for over two hundred years. As a result, I fear
that partisan impeachment efforts may well
become just another tool in the political arse-
nal, expected to be pursued by whichever
party loses a presidential election.
The damage done to our constitutional proc-
esses and to our institutions by this hyper-par-
tisan, flawed process is greater than any al-
leged harm done by the President’s phone
call. I hope and trust that the American people
in their wisdom will see that appropriate
boundaries and constitutional balance are re-
stored.
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, im-
peaching a President is one of the most sol-
emn and consequential decisions the United
States Congress can make. It is not an action
I or my fellow House colleagues take lightly.
Impeachment exists to protect our democracy.
As Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist
Papers, the impeachment clause in the Con-
stitution exists to address ‘‘the misconduct of
public men,’’ which involves ‘‘the abuse or vio-
lation of some public trust.’’
The investigations and hearings conducted
by the House Intelligence and Judiciary Com-
mittees provide overwhelming evidence that
President Trump abused his power and en-
dangered our national security when he co-
erced Ukraine into investigating his likely rival
in the 2020 election by withholding $391 mil-
lion in critical military aid and a White House
meeting from the Ukrainian government. With-
holding this military assistance to Ukraine as it
enters the fifth year of its deadly war against
Russia endangers Ukraine’s sovereignty and
safety as well as the United States’ national
security interests.
President Trump has also issued a blanket
order prohibiting all executive office personnel
from testifying in Congressional impeachment
hearings, responding to subpoenas and turn-
ing over documents. Therefore, he has ob-
structed the legitimate and Constitutional obli-
gation Congress has to conduct an impeach-
ment inquiry when there is evidence of wrong-
doing by the President.
No one is above the law. The President’s
actions leave me no choice. President Trump
has violated his oath to ‘‘faithfully execute the
Office of the President of the United States,’’
and to, ‘‘preserve, protect and defend the
Constitution of the United States against all
enemies foreign and domestic.’’ Now I will up-
hold my Oath of Office to preserve and protect
our Constitution and my promise to my con-
stituents to carefully analyze all issues before
me. I will vote in favor of both articles of im-
peachment against President Donald John
Trump.
Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, the arti-
cles of impeachment introduced in the U.S.

security, and ensure our democracy is not cor-
rupted by a foreign power. For every Member
of Congress, holding the President of the
United States accountable to the Constitution
and protecting our most fundamental demo-
cratic values is not a political decision based
on loyalty or partisan affiliation. In fact, it is an
inherent duty upon which we have sworn a sa-
cred oath.
The sole person responsible for precipitating
this impeachment process is President Donald
J. Trump. President Trump’s willful, flagrant,
and corrupt misconduct is a betrayal of the
public trust. At this historic and sober moment,
the American people understand that as a na-
tion of laws there can be no person, not even
the President of the United States, who is
above the law. Let these articles of impeach-
ment also serve as a clear and unambiguous
message to all future presidents: Congress, as
a co-equal branch of government, will never
tolerate or appease an abusive, corrupt execu-
tive.
With the power granted to the U.S. House
under Article I, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitu-
tion (‘The House of Representatives . . . shall
have the sole Power of Impeachment’), I in-
tend to vote in favor of the resolution to im-
peach President Donald J. Trump for high
crimes and misdemeanors.
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, this is the fourth impeach-
ment proceeding against a president of the
United States, and the most serious.
President Trump committed numerous
crimes. He conditioned two official acts, hun-
dreds of millions of dollars in military aid and
an Oval Office meeting, on getting help for his
campaign in return. When his scheme was
publicly exposed, he did everything possible to
obstruct the investigation.
Congress voted to grant hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars in military aid to our ally
Ukraine because it is both morally right and in
our national interest to stand with them in their
fight to preserve their independence against
Russian aggression. I was one of the mem-
bers of Congress who advocated and voted
for this military aid. It was never intended to
become a bargaining chip for the President to
use to get foreign help for his re-election cam-
paign.
The factual evidence is clear and con-
vincing. It was reinforced by the testimonies of
every single fact witness, all of whom are ca-
reer, nonpartisan public servants or Trump ap-
pointees.
So, the matter before us, ultimately, is not a
question of fact, for the evidence is undis-
puted. Nor is it a question of law, as the Con-
stitution is clear. The heart of the matter is
this: will Members of this House have the
courage to choose fidelity to the Constitution
over loyalty to political party?
The Constitution has endured for more than
two centuries, not just because of the bril-
liance of our founders, but because of the
commitment of generations of Americans to
uphold it. For the sake of our Constitution, and
the sake of our country, for Americans today
and tomorrow, I urge all Members to have the
courage to vote yes.
Mr. VISCLOSKY. I rise today in sup-
port of two articles of impeachment—
one regarding abuse of power and one
regarding obstruction of Congress—
against President Trump.
I decided to support the President’s
impeachment after a judicious consid-
eration of the facts established by the
House Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence (HPSCI) and the House
Committee on the Judiciary, as well as
reflecting upon my constitutional re-
sponsibilities as a Member of Congress.
I would note that the constitutional
remedy for high crimes and mis-
demeanors—such as abuse of power—is
impeachment. Regrettably, the Presi-
dent’s severe misconduct with respect
to Ukraine showed a complete dis-
regard for our constitution, our demo-
cratic system of government, and the
security of our nation and our allies.
The President left the House with little
choice but to faithfully discharge its
duty.
As the Chairman of the House Appro-
priations Subcommittee on Defense, I
believe that it is unconscionable that
an American leader would use nearly
$400 million in military aid appro-
priated by Congress—and signed into
law by the President himself—as lever-
age for personal gain.
There are fundamental reasons why
U.S. law provided these desperately
needed funds to Ukraine. I would em-
phasize that, in 2014, Russia invaded
Ukraine and illegally annexed the
Ukrainian territory of Crimea while
Russian-backed separatist forces seized
control of key cities in eastern
Ukraine. The fighting in eastern
Ukraine continues to this day and has
killed more than 13,000 Ukrainians
while forcibly displacing more than
two million individuals.
Additionally, the impeachment re-
ports issued by the HPSCI and the
House Committee on the Judiciary
present an irrefutable case that the
President’s behavior constituted an on-
going threat to a free and fair Presi-
dential election in 2020.
Further, I believe that the Presi-
dent’s refusal to comply with the im-
peachment inquiry is representative of
his broader contempt for Congress and
its constitutional role as a separate
and coequal branch of government.
Congress must continue to work dili-
gently to protect and fully exert its
complete range of constitutional pre-
rogatives and maintain the balance of
power that has existed for 231 years.
Finally, I would highlight that the
administration’s complete repudiation
of constitutionally-proscribed legisla-
tive authorities stands in stark con-
trast to the courage and patriotism
demonstrated by the whistleblower
who filed a formal complaint with the
Intelligence Community’s Inspector
General, as well as the public servants
who testified before the House. These
individuals deserve our utmost respect
and gratitude.
As the Senate moves forward with a
trial to determine whether to convict
the President of impeachable offenses,
be assured that I will continue to work
hard to address the pressing needs of
our nation’s citizens, from creating
more opportunities for good-paying
jobs to decreasing the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time
for general debate has expired.
Pursuant to House Resolution 767,
the previous question is ordered on the
resolution, as amended.
The question of adoption of the reso-
lution, as amended, shall be divided be-
tween the two articles.
The question is on the adoption of
Article I.

PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Eternal God, the giver of every good
and perfect gift, help our Senators to
listen clearly to Your sacred Word and
find wisdom in Your guidance. May
they remember Your teachings and
courageously follow them.
As You guide them along the right
path, keep them from stumbling. May
they live such exemplary lives that
they will be like sunlight at dawn,

Lord, give our lawmakers wisdom to

f
PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING
REDUCTION ACT
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President,
Senator WYDEN and I received a letter
from the Michael J. Fox Foundation
for Parkinson’s Research. Their letter
endorsed our bipartisan Prescription
Drug Pricing Reduction Act, which
tries to respond to what we are hearing
from our constituents about the public
outrage over the big increases in pre-
scription drugs.
Now, it happens with Parkinson’s dis-
ease that about 1 million Americans
have it, and it seems like up to now
there is no way to stop it or cure it,
but thanks to modern medicine, the
symptoms can be treated to help pa-
tients live a much better life.
Ninety percent of all individuals di-
agnosed with Parkinson’s disease are
on Medicare. Our bill, the bill to reduce
prescription drug prices, would help
these seniors afford their medicine
with a cap on out-of-pocket expenses.
In other words, they would know at the
beginning of the year that they only
have to spend x number of dollars on
drugs, no more.
Of course, this brings me to what
Congress should be doing. Congress
needs to act, not only for those with
Parkinson’s disease, but for all Ameri-
cans who need our help.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.

ator from Illinois.
TOBACCO TO 21
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this
week we are going to be voting on some
appropriation bills. They are rather
large. They call them minibuses. But
there will be six or eight appropria-
tions bills bunched together, and they
will include things other than strictly
spending measures.
One of the areas that will be ad-
dressed is the age that you must reach
to purchase tobacco and vaping mate-
rials in the United States. It is known
euphemistically as T–21, and I have
supported it for years. The notion of
raising the purchasing age to 21 for
these products, to me, just makes
sense.
We know that they are addictive.
Both cigarette tobacco and vaping ma-
terials have nicotine in them, a highly
addictive chemical. Raising the age of
purchase across the United States to 21
makes sense.
But I am disappointed as well. Al-
though I originally sponsored this bill,
there have been several revelations in
the last few months, which call for us
to move far beyond the idea of estab-
lishing a new age for purchasing these
products, and let me be specific.
One of the things we have been work-
ing on is trying to address the shock-
ing increase in the use of vaping mate-
rials and e-cigarettes by young people
across America. It has been called a
public health epidemic, not by a politi-
cian but by the Commissioner of the
Food and Drug Administration. That
Commissioner told us, as well as the
Surgeon General of the United States,
that this is an issue that cannot be ig-
nored.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7124 December 18, 2019
Today, we estimate that nearly 30
percent of school-age children are
vaping—more than 5 million kids
across America.
A group of young high schoolers
came in to see me from New York last
week and said: Senator, you are all
wrong. In our schools it is a majority.
A majority of the students are
vaping, not only outside of the school,
but even in the classroom. They have
hooked up vaping devices to the cloth-
ing that they are wearing, and when
the teacher turns his or her back on
the class, they are puffing on their
vaping materials—their Juuls—and
blowing the white vapor into the air of
the classroom.
It sounds incredible, but they told me
it is true and it happens all over the
school—in the restrooms, in the cafe-
teria, in the classrooms.
The reason it is happening is that so
many students are vaping now and it is
an addiction. As these students con-
tinue to vape, their appetite for the
product grows.
Kids are using these products for
many reasons, and I can get into the
psychology of it for a minute, but let
me dwell on the obvious.
The flavors that are being sold on
these vaping materials are designed for
them—to attract children to Juul’s
products, to flavors like Cotton Candy,
Unicorn Milk—whatever the heck that
is—Cool Mint, Mom’s Sugar Cookies,
and, yes, Menthol.
According to the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, more than 80 percent of
children who vape start with a flavored
e-cigarette.
Now, the vaping industry says: Oh,
you have got it all wrong. You see, this
is a non-tobacco product which people
can use to get off cigarettes.
Well, that sounds pretty noble;
doesn’t it? We want people to move
away from something more dangerous,
like tobacco cigarettes.
But when you look at the incidence
of people using this product, it is min-
iscule in terms of adults with a tobacco
addiction moving to vaping products,
and the number of children and young
students moving from non-vaping to
vaping is dramatic. As I mentioned, the
official figures are 30 percent of high
school students.
According to the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, one of the things that is
luring young people to this behavior is
the flavoring or the flavor pods. Does
anyone believe these flavors are in-
tended for some 50-year-old chain
smoker who wants to give up on to-
bacco cigarettes—flavors like Farley’s
Gnarly Sauce, Bubble Purp by Chubby
Bubbles, Blue Razz by Candy King, Cot-
ton Candy by Zonk? Some 50-year-old
is attracted to Cotton Candy by Zonk?
We know better. These flavor pods
are made for kids—to attract kids, get
them started, get them hooked, and
make them lifelong customers.
Together with bipartisan colleagues,
I have pressed the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration and the White House for
years to put an end to these kid-friend-
ly flavor pods.
Well, the tobacco giant Altria—it
used to be Philip Morris, if I am not
mistaken—stepped in and bought the
lion’s share of the stock of Juul, the
most prolific producer of vaping de-
vices in the United States.
Altria knows this business and how
to attract kids because they used to
make Marlboro cigarettes. Remember
that cowboy designed to appeal across
the board, particularly to young smok-
ers?
Well, now they have a new gig. It is
called vaping, e-cigarettes, and Altria
has bought in in a big way.
They have been taking out ads to
support raising the Federal age to pur-
chase tobacco products to 21.
Wait a minute. A tobacco company
wants to raise the age for purchasing
the products?
They do. They see it as inevitable,
but it is also part of their market
strategy. That is the same policy I
have supported, and I thank my col-
leagues Senator SCHATZ and Senator
KAINE for joining in the effort, along
with Senator ROMNEY. But what we
have seen is that Altria has invested
$13 billion to acquire a 35-percent stake
in Juul, which controls more than 70
percent of the vaping market. Tobacco
is big in vaping.
Altria and Juul together now believe
that if the only thing we do is just
raise the tobacco age to 21, they will be
in the clear and they can avoid the
scrutiny for their targeted efforts to
hook kids on e-cigarettes.
I disagree. I have made clear that
any T–21, ‘‘Tobacco to 21’’ policy must
be coupled with meaningful provisions
to get rid of the e-cigarette flavors now
addicting our kids, but they have
turned to one of their allies, Senator
MCCONNELL, on this effort, who was an
original sponsor on T–21. His party re-
sisted the effort to join the banning of
flavor pods for e-cigarettes as part of
the T–21 bill in our appropriations bill.
I fear that the spending bill will
come before us and include just the T–
21 policy, and that of course doesn’t ad-
dress what is happening with vaping
among children in America.
If we are serious about sparing Amer-
icans, particularly our kids, from ad-
dictions to nicotine, it has to reach be-
yond tobacco cigarettes to vaping. It is
a mistake not to do so.
The public health community agrees
with me on that. Any serious solution
to skyrocketing rates of youth e-ciga-
rette use must include the removal of
kid-friendly flavors—not just the to-
bacco industry’s preferred policy—and
I will continue to work with Members
on both sides of the aisle in pushing to
do so.
Finally, let me say on this subject
that on September 15, President Trump
held a press conference in the Oval Of-
fice on this subject of vaping. Sitting
next to him was the First Lady of the
United States, Melania Trump. She
doesn’t often stand up on political
issues, but she is the mother of a teen-
ager, and she decided to speak out
against vaping. I thanked her. I praised
her along with the President. They did
the right thing, but now we are not
sure where the President is on this sub-
ject. We are not sure if he is going to
continue his effort to end the scourge
of vaping and e-cigarettes.
I hope the President comes back to
the position he announced in Sep-
tember. We need his help to ban these
flavor pods.
The recent appointee as FDA Com-
missioner, Stephen Hahn, has told me
personally and many of my colleagues
that he thinks this is a serious issue. I
believe he ought to be given the au-
thority to exercise his legal right and
power to stop these pods and stop these
devices as quickly as possible.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRAMER). Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized.
IMPEACHMENT
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, all
eyes today are on the House of Rep-
resentatives. The country is waiting to
see whether these House Democrats
will give in to the temptation that
every other House in modern history
has managed to resist and misuse the
solemn process of impeachment to
blow off partisan steam. I will have
more to say on this subject if House
Democrats do, in fact, proceed.
Yesterday I came to the floor to dis-
cuss one initial aspect of this that con-
cerns our Senate process. Over the
weekend, my colleague the Democratic
leader began asking the Senate to
break from precedent, break with the
unanimous template from 1999, and
begin choreographing the middle of a
potential trial before we have even
heard opening arguments.
Back in 1999, all 100 Senators agreed
on a simple pretrial resolution that set
up a briefing, opening arguments, Sen-
ators’ questions, and a vote on a mo-
tion to dismiss. Senators reserved all
other questions, such as witnesses,
until the trial was underway. That was
the unanimous bipartisan precedent
from 1999. Put first things first, lay the
bipartisan groundwork and leave
midtrial questions to the middle of the
trial.
I have hoped, and still hope, that the
Democratic leader and I can sit down
and reproduce that unanimous bipar-
tisan agreement this time. His decision
to try to angrily negotiate through the
press is unfortunate, but no amount of
bluster will change the simple fact that
we already have a unanimous bipar-
tisan precedent. If 100 Senators

thought this approach was good enough
for President Clinton, it ought to be
good enough for President Trump.
I hope House Democrats see reason to
pull back from the precipice, but if
they proceed, I hope the Democratic
leader and I can sit down soon and
honor the template that was unani-
mously agreed to the last time.
Mr. President, on another matter, in
the meantime, the Senate is busy com-
pleting the legislation our country ac-
tually needs. Yesterday the Senate
passed the NDAA conference report and
put it on President Trump’s desk.
Thanks to the diligence of Chairman
INHOFE and Ranking Member REED,
this critical legislation to support our
armed services will become law for a
59th consecutive year.
APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. President, tomorrow we will vote
on government funding bills the House
passed yesterday. A lot of hard work
brought this appropriations process
back from the brink. Here are some of
the important things that will happen
as a result: stable, full-year funding for
our Armed Forces, including research
and modernization; the largest pay
raise for our troops in a decade; and
more support for key alliances like
NATO, close partners like Israel, and
high-priority areas like Hong Kong.
The bills also deliver on vital domes-
tic priorities as well. It funds infra-
structure and transportation projects.
It repeals even more of Obamacare by
cutting out more harmful taxes.
Every single State wins in this bill.
By way of example, here are a few ways
my State will benefit. This bill keeps
the decade-old promise of a new, mod-
ern VA medical center with a special
emphasis on care for women veterans.
There is support for fighting invasive
Asian Carp in West Kentucky, for Cen-
tral Kentucky’s role in high-tech agri-
cultural research. Of course, Kentucky
has a huge stake in our Nation’s battle
against opioid and substance abuse. I
am proud these bills fund housing and
treatment programs established by my
CAREER Act to help those in long-
term recovery reenter the workforce.
Speaking of addiction, I am espe-
cially proud that this legislation in-
cludes my T–21 legislation to raise the
nationwide age for purchasing tobacco
and vaping products to 21 years old and
help roll back the explosion in tobacco
and nicotine use among our Nation’s
youth.
I am proud to have worked with Sen-
ator KAINE and others on both sides to
ensure that the legislation we drafted
became law this year. Senator TODD
YOUNG of Indiana was also deeply in-
volved in this as well. I am proud that
these bills include direct bipartisan ac-
tion that I urged to shore up the loom-
ing pension and healthcare crisis faced
by coal communities in Kentucky and
across the Nation.
These are some examples from Ken-
tucky. This legislation touches, in fact,
all 50 States. This is why full-year
funding bills are better than chronic
CRs. This is why the Senate should
pass these bills this way and send them
to the President’s desk.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for

The Senator from South Dakota.
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, we are
wrapping up the year in the Senate,
and I am looking forward to getting
home to South Dakota for Christmas.
Before we leave, we will wrap up this
year’s spending bills, including the De-
fense funding bill.
Yesterday we passed the National De-
fense Authorization Act, which is year-
ly legislation to authorize funding for
our military and our national defense.
I am pleased to report that this year’s
bill authorizes the full annual funding
request for development of the B–21
bomber, which will be coming to Ells-
worth in the not-too-distant future.
The news that Ellsworth Air Force
Base had been selected as the first
home of the future B–21 Raider was ex-
citing news this year. Ellsworth Air
Force Base has been a priority of mine
since I first came to the Senate and
worked with a lot of dedicated people
to prevent Ellsworth from being closed
by the Base Realignment and Closure
Commission in 2005.
Since then, I have worked with the
other Members of the South Dakota
delegation and the Air Force and com-
munity leaders to make sure the base
never again finds itself in the same po-
sition. Among other things, our efforts
resulted in the expansion of the Powder
River Training Complex into the larg-
est training airspace in the continental
United States.
It is undoubtedly partly thanks to
this airspace that Ellsworth was cho-
sen as the first home for the B–21. Ells-
worth is going from strength to
strength. I am honored to advocate for
our national security and the airmen
at Ellsworth in the U.S. Senate.
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA TRADE
AGREEMENT
Mr. President, agriculture is the life-
blood of our economy in South Dakota,
and our farmers and ranchers are al-
ways at the top of my priority list in
the Senate. Thanks to national disas-
ters, protracted trade disputes, and
several years of low commodity prices,
farmers and ranchers have had a tough
few years.
This spring, farmers throughout the
Midwest were hit with heavy rainfall
and flooding. By the time the soil fi-
nally dried out enough for planting, it
was too late for many farmers to plant
their normal crops, and many had to
turn quick-growing cover crops that
could be used for feed and grazing and
to protect the soil.
The farmers in South Dakota and
other Northern States faced a problem.
The Department of Agriculture had set
November 1 as the first date on which
farmers could harvest these cover crops
for feed or use them for pasture with-
out having their crop insurance indem-
nity reduced.
Farmers who hayed or grazed before
this date faced a reduction in their pre-
vent plant indemnity payments, which
are crop insurance payments to help
them cover their income loss when the
fields can’t be planted due to flooding
or other issues.
While November 1 is a reasonable
date for farmers in Southern States,
for farmers in Northern States like
South Dakota, November 1 is too late
for harvesting thanks to killing frost
and the risk of late fall and early win-
ter storms. It is too late to maximize
the use of cover crops for pasture, since
a killing frost is liable to flatten cover
crops before they are grazed.
So, beginning in early May, I started
pressing the Department of Agriculture
to change the November 1 date. In
June, the Department of Agriculture
announced that it would move up the
November 1 date for 2019 by 2 months,
to September 1—a significant amount
of time that allowed South Dakota
farmers to plant cover crops without
worrying about whether they would be
able to successfully harvest or graze
them.
A year ago this week, the President
signed into law the 2018 farm bill,
which contained nearly 20 provisions
that I authored based on input from
South Dakota farmers and ranchers.
This year, I have closely monitored the
Department of Agriculture’s imple-
mentation of the bill. In particular, I
have pressed the Department of Agri-
culture to implement the bill’s im-
provements to the Conservation Re-
serve Program and hold CRP signups,
and I am pleased the administration
opened a CRP signup earlier this
month.
When I talk to farmers and ranchers
at home in South Dakota, they empha-
size that the most important thing
Washington can do to boost our agri-
culture economy is to take action on
trade agreements.
Farmers and ranchers need access to
new and expanded markets for their
products. Just as importantly, they
need certainty about what inter-
national markets are going to look
like going forward.
I have spent a lot of time this year
pushing for Congress to approve the
United States-Mexico-Canada Trade
Agreement. After months and months
of unnecessary delay, I am pleased this
agreement is now moving forward. I am
hopeful the Senate will pass it in Janu-
ary so the farmers and ranchers can
start experiencing the benefits.
RENEWABLE FUELS

for corn farmers came this year with

that it would permit the year-round

sale of E15, which is 15 percent ethanol-
blended fuel. I spent over a decade ad-
vocating the year-round sale of E15,
and I was very pleased by the adminis-
tration’s announcement.
However, for corn farmers to see the
full benefit of year-round E15 sales, the
Environmental Protection Agency
needs to start accounting for its un-
precedented use of small refinery ex-
emptions. These so-called hardship
waivers should be limited only to in-
stances where small refiners would no
longer be profitable or competitive by
complying with their blending obliga-
tion under the renewable fuel standard.
On Friday, the EPA is poised to final-
ize a supplemental rule that it assures
us will deliver on the President’s com-
mitments to account for waivers and to
truly blend 15 billion gallons of ethanol
each year.
However, based on this EPA’s track
record, it is difficult to trust it will re-
treat from its aggressive issuance of
small refinery exemptions. I hope the
EPA proves me wrong, but I think I
speak for most of farm country when I
say I will believe it when I see it.
On the topic of renewable fuels, I am
happy to be able to say that the bio-
diesel tax credit will be extended for 5
years, through 2022, as part of this
year’s tax extenders deal. Biodiesel is a
good deal for farmers, as it adds value
to each bushel of soybeans by making
use of the oil from bean processing, and
it is a good deal for our environment
because the use of this fuel lowers
emissions.
MOBILE NOW ACT
Mr. President, as a former chairman
of the Senate Commerce Committee
and current chair of the Commerce
Subcommittee on Communications,
Technology, Innovation, and the Inter-
net, I have spent a lot of time over the
last few years focused on Internet,
communications, and data privacy
issues.
One big priority of mine has been
paving the way for 5G—the next gen-
eration of wireless technology—ensur-
ing that rural areas and not just big
cities get this technology.
Last year, the President signed the
law, my bipartisan MOBILE NOW Act,
which was legislation I introduced to
help secure adequate spectrum for 5G
technology.
STREAMLINE SMALL CELL DEPLOYMENT ACT
Mr. President, earlier this year, Sen-
ator SCHATZ and I introduced the
STREAMLINE Small Cell Deployment
Act to address the other part of the 5G
equation. That is infrastructure.
I was thrilled to be home in Sioux
Falls to mark a huge milestone for the
city and for South Dakota—the unveil-
ing of Sioux Falls’ first 5G small cells,
which are small antennas that will join
traditional cell towers to support 5G
technology.
5G has tremendous promise for rural
areas, but it will deliver on that prom-
ise only if we ensure that 5G cells are
actually deployed in these areas. I am
proud we have made a good start in
South Dakota. The Sioux Falls mayor,
Paul TenHaken, has worked aggres-
sively to remove barriers to tele-
communications investment in Sioux
Falls.
Advancing 5G will continue to be a
priority of mine here in the Senate. We
want the United States, not China or
South Korea, to win the race to 5G and
to seize the economic benefits that 5G
will bring.
Another thing I have spent a lot of
time working on in the Commerce
Committee this year is data privacy. In
October, I introduced the Filter Bubble
Transparency Act, which is designed to
address one aspect of the data privacy
problem—the issues that arise from
internet companies’ use of consumers’
personal data to shape what consumers
see on their platforms.
I also introduced legislation this year
with Senator ED MARKEY to address
the problem of annoying, illegal
robocalls. I am hopeful that our legis-
lation, the Telephone Robocall Abuse
Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence
Act—or the TRACED Act—will pass
the Senate soon and be on the Presi-
dent’s desk before Christmas.
I have worked on a lot of other bills
this year to make life better for South
Dakotans and American families. I
have introduced tax reform bills to
help small businesses, update the tax
code for the 21st century economy, en-
courage charitable giving, and perma-
nently protect family farms from the
death tax. I have introduced legislation
to protect access to healthcare in rural
areas, helped Americans repay their
student loans, and much more. I will
continue to work on these issues in the
new year.
As always, my priority will be ensur-
ing that Congress is addressing the
challenges facing South Dakota fami-
lies.
The holidays are a time to reflect on
the blessings we have received, and I
feel truly blessed to call the great
State of South Dakota home. It is an
honor and a privilege to represent the
people of South Dakota in the U.S.
Senate.
To all South Dakotans, I hope you
have a wonderful Christmas and a joy-
ous holiday season. I look forward to
continuing to represent your priorities
here in Washington and in the coming
new year.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER

IMPEACHMENT
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in re-
sponse to the limited set of relevant
witnesses I proposed for a potential
Senate trial earlier this week, the Re-
publican leader gave a lengthy speech
on the floor yesterday and another
speech today. In neither of those
speeches could the Republican leader
offer one salient argument as to why
the witnesses I proposed—all senior
Trump administration officials—
shouldn’t be allowed to testify. In-
stead, he made what are, in my view,
irrelevant and incomplete comparisons
to the 1999 Clinton trial.
When faced with the fact that it is
only fair to have these witnesses, who
were eyewitnesses to the major, major
allegations against the President and
who had not testified before, the leader
can’t talk about 2019. He has to go back
to 1999 because he has no good argu-
ment as to why they shouldn’t testify.
We are not asking to be dilatory. We
are not asking for a list of 4,000 wit-
nesses. We are simply asking that
those who know the truth best come
and talk to us here in the Senate and
to the American people.
There is one fact that is impossible
for the Senate to ignore. In the two
Presidential impeachment trials in the
history of this body, the Senate heard
from witnesses, but Leader MCCONNELL
continues to push for no witnesses in
the Senate trial. I have yet to hear an
explanation as to why less evidence is
better than more evidence, particu-
larly when it comes to something as
somber, as serious, and as important as
impeachment of the President of the
United States of America.
Leader MCCONNELL keeps talking
about 1999 because he doesn’t want to
talk about 2019. The two situations are
not analogous. Rather than focus on
the past, the Republican leader should
focus on the present and offer one good
reason why relevant witnesses
shouldn’t testify in an impeachment
trial of President Trump, particularly
in light of the fact that we have not

heard from them. They probably have
better evidence than anybody, even
though the evidence the House has pre-
pared, in the eyes of so many, is over-
whelming.
I was disappointed to hear yesterday
that Leader MCCONNELL declared that
he would not be an impartial juror
when it comes to the serious charges
against President Trump. He said it
proudly. What kind of example does
that set for the country, which is look-
ing for fairness and impartiality?
In the event of a trial, every Senator
will swear an oath—different from our
standard oath of office—to do impartial
justice, but yesterday MCCONNELL told
reporters: ‘‘I’m not an impartial juror.
This is a political process. I’m not im-
partial about this at all.’’ Let me re-
peat that. Let the American people
hear it loud and clear. The Republican
leader said proudly: ‘‘I’m not an impar-
tial juror. . . . I’m not impartial about
this at all.’’ This is an astonishing ad-
mission of partisanship. The President
may demand these public displays of
fealty, but they are troubling for the
leader of an independent branch of our
government. I hope all Senators will
take seriously the oath to do impartial
justice that we seem likely to take in
the near future.
The House of Representatives, of
course, will take a historic vote today
on the impeachment of President Don-
ald J. Trump. If the articles of im-
peachment are passed, the focus will
quickly move to the Senate, where our
Chamber will serve as a court of im-
peachment. We must, very soon, figure
out the rules and procedures that will
allow the Senate to rise to this occa-
sion.
Despite our disagreements, I do ex-
pect to sit down with Leader MCCON-
NELL in the near future to discuss these
matters. I have proposed a very reason-
able structure for a trial based on the
grand American tradition of a fair and
speedy trial. We propose four wit-
nesses—only those with direct knowl-
edge of the charges made by the House;
only those who could provide new, rel-
evant, and potentially illuminating
testimony—and place strict time lim-
its on each stage of the process to pre-
vent the trial from dragging out too
long. No one is interested in delaying.
The Senate’s goal, above all, should
be to conduct a trial with dignity, fair-
ness to both sides, and one that exam-
ines all the relevant facts. There are
large partisan divisions these days, but
I suspect most Senate Republicans
would agree with these goals. I suspect
that even President Trump would agree
with these goals—or at least say that
he did. The President has repeatedly
complained about a lack of due process
and said that he ‘‘would love’’—his
words—‘‘would love’’ for aides like Mr.
Mulvaney to testify in the Senate.
Setting aside for the moment that
the President has refused to partici-
pate in the House process despite mul-
tiple invitations; setting aside for the
moment that he has blocked witnesses
from appearing and documents from
being produced—Mr. President, we are
offering you the due process you
sought in your letter last night. Allow
your current and former aides—
Mulvaney, Blair, Duffey, Bolton—to
testify on your behalf. Turn over all
the requested documents and show that
you and your aides didn’t try to use
taxpayer money to force a foreign gov-
ernment to announce an investigation
against your political opponent. Let
the truth come out.
Mr. President, we are offering you
due process. Due process means the
right to be heard. Please take it. Don’t
ask for it and then refuse to take ad-
vantage of it.
President Trump, you have a habit of
accusing others of the offenses that
you have, in fact, committed. You ac-
cuse the House of affording no due
process while obstructing the process
every step of the way. If you truly
want due process to present your side
of the case, President Trump, let your
aides testify and turn over the docu-
ments we requested.
We want to conduct a fair trial—fair
to both sides. We don’t know whether
the witnesses we propose will incrimi-
nate the President or exonerate him.
They are the appointees of President
Donald J. Trump; they are hardly bi-
ased. We don’t know what their testi-
mony will be, but we do know one
thing: We should hear from them. We
just want the facts—‘‘Just the facts,
ma’am,’’ as Detective Friday says—
facts that will allow Senators to make
fully informed decisions about some-
thing as serious—so serious—as the
conviction or acquittal of an im-
peached President.
Each individual Senator will have
the power and will have the responsi-
bility to help shape what an impeach-
ment trial looks like. Do my Repub-
lican colleagues want a fair and honest
trial that examines all the facts, or do
they want to participate in a coverup?
APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. President, now on appropria-
tions, before the week concludes, we
must pass legislation to keep the gov-
ernment open and provide appropria-
tions for the following year. Luckily,
over the weekend, an agreement was
reached between appropriators—House
and Senate, Democratic and Repub-
lican—that would see us achieve that
goal.
I am proud to report that the final
appropriations agreements include sev-
eral important Democratic priorities
to help American families and to help
American security.
Democrats have secured more than
$425 million in election security
grants—nearly double the amount Sen-
ate Republicans reluctantly supported
in earlier legislation. Democrats have
secured an increase of $550 million in
grants to help offset the cost of
childcare for low-income families.
Democrats have made progress on sev-
eral fronts to combat climate change,
record-level funding for clean energy
and energy efficiency programs,
record-level funding to provide clean,
electric buses, and increased funding
for climate change science and re-
search.
For the first time in decades, Demo-
crats have secured $25 million in gun
violence research at the CDC and NIH,
breaking through what had been a ri-
diculous ban on fact—another ban on
fact now broken because we can do gun
violence research. Medical research,
scientific research, environmental pro-
tection, and education and housing
programs will see significant increases
in Federal support.
Of course, we did not achieve every-
thing we wanted. I am particularly and
strongly disappointed, for one, that the
tax agreement included in the second
package omits critical clean energy
tax incentives to fight climate change,
including incentives for electric vehi-
cles, battery storage, and offshore wind
and solar energy. This is a fight we
have been waging and we will continue
to wage. It is a fight Democrats intend
to return to in 2020 when we negotiate
the next tax agreement.
I am also sorely and deeply dis-
appointed that we were unable to reach
an agreement on the drinking water
standard and more resources to clean
up PFAS contamination—a toxic
chemical that has plagued too many
communities in New York and across
the country.
People on the other side of the aisle
should look at these. The President,
who was against many of these pro-
posals, should reexamine them. We
need them. Senate Democrats—Senator
LEAHY, the appropriators—have done a
lot of hard work on this issue. Our dis-
appointment today will in no way di-
minish our resolve to force Congress to
take further actions next year, particu-
larly on PFAS and on clean energy.
I yield the floor.

HOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today
to talk about one of our most com-
plicated areas where diplomats have to
engage when brutal regimes and terror
groups seize Americans and use them
as hostages, hoping to extract conces-
sions from our government. These are
situations that are infuriating, and
they are heartbreaking. At the same
time, they are immensely complicated.
There are no easy solutions when deal-
ing with hostage-takers.
We know what doesn’t work. We
know that paying ransom for hostages,
as the Obama administration did with
Iran to the tune of billions of dollars,
only incentivizes more hostage-taking.
It is exactly the behavior you would
expect from hostage-takers, and it is
exactly the behavior we have seen
played out over and over. My col-
leagues and I, along with the Trump
administration, have sought other
ways of securing the release of Amer-
ican hostages.
Sometimes what is called for is diplo-
matic pressure. So early in my tenure
in the Senate, the very first bill that I
passed into law was legislation that
kept Iranian regime figures who had
seized American hostages in 1979 from
receiving diplomatic visas to come into
the United States.
I also recently joined with Senator
COTTON to introduce the Global Hos-
tage Act, a bill that would require the
President to impose sanctions on for-
eign government officials responsible
for taking Americans hostage.
The Trump administration recently
secured the release of Americans held
hostage in Iran without the need for
pallets of cash flown in the darkness of
night. Nevertheless, all of these solu-
tions are imperfect. So it is no surprise
that even in countries where we enjoy
successes, those successes are often
heartbreakingly partial, with hostages
left behind.
Today, I want to talk about two
countries, specifically, where Ameri-
cans from my home State of Texas are
languishing today.
In Syria we have seen some Ameri-
cans released while others remain away
from their families. This summer,
American Sam Goodwin and Canadian
Kristian Baxter were released by cap-
tors in Syria, which were joyful devel-
opments on their own and encouraging
signs of progress. But Austin Tice re-
mains in captivity after more than 7
agonizing years. Austin is a Texan and
a veteran Marine Corps captain who
served our country in Iraq and Afghan-
istan. He was working as a freelance
journalist to inform Americans about
the horror of the Syrian conflict when
he was captured.
I have repeatedly had the oppor-
tunity to sit down and visit with Aus-
tin’s parents, Marc and Debra. Austin’s
picture sits on my desk in my Senate
office, and I remain committed to
working with President Trump, with
the Trump administration, with my
colleagues in Congress to bring Austin
home.
I joined with 51 Senators, 120 Rep-
resentatives to write a letter to Presi-
dent Trump affirming that ‘‘the Tice
family and your own administration
are confident that Austin is alive’’ and
calling on President Trump to redouble
our country’s efforts to bring him
home. No one should doubt the entire
U.S. Government’s commitment to this
task.
Secondly, in Venezuela, we have also
seen partial progress but partial
progress of a different sort. In the case
of the Citgo 6—five American citizens
and one permanent American resi-
dent—they have been released from
jail, which is a good thing, but they re-
main under house arrest.
So while Jose Luis Zambrano, Alirio
Zambrano, Jorge Toledo, Gustavo
Cardenas, Tomeu Vadell, and Jose
Angel Pereira are no longer under the
constant threat of dying from abuse
and neglect, they are still very much
held captive and away from their loved
ones. Today, here in the gallery, are
Gabriela and Alirio Rafael, the daugh-
ter and the brother of Alirio Zambrano.
These five Texans and one
Louisianan are now 2 years into their
nightmarish journey. They had been
summoned to Caracas a week shy of
Thanksgiving, and upon their arrival,
they were summarily detained and re-
mained in jail on orders of the Ven-
ezuelan military. They would go days
without food and months without sun-
light, but the random punishments
were nothing if not persistent.
I have met members of the Citgo 6
families many times. Alexandra
Forseth, Alirio Zambrano’s daughter,
shared with me haunting accounts that
came from her father. He described ex-
actly how harrowing the experience
has been and the physical toll it has
taken.
These families have left no stones
unturned in their efforts to bring back
their loved ones. They have hired law-
yers who have grappled with the shift-
ing and inadequate legal institutions in
Venezuela, and they have found little
recourse.
After years of this literal darkness,
just last week the Citgo 6 were released
to house arrest. This is progress. It is
undeniable progress, but it is far from
enough. Here, too, we must redouble
our efforts to ensure their full release,
to ensure that they can come home to
America. Every effort must be made to
bring them back to the United States,
to their families, to their children, to
their homes.
Sergio Cardenas, the son of Gustavo
Cardenas, was born with a rare disease,
and at the age of 17, he is battling
chronic congestive heart failure. The
doctors and his family are gravely con-
cerned that he will never see his father.
Jose Toledo’s mother is severely
handicapped and requires constant
medical attention and care. Alirio and
Jose Luis both have teenage daughters
currently in high school. These fami-
lies are waiting for their fathers, for
their sons, for their husbands to come
home.
Venezuela has a seat on the United
Nations Human Rights Council. If
human rights means anything, it is
that citizens of all countries are enti-
tled to speedy due process and that
human rights violations must have
human rights remedies. The Citgo 6
have suffered enough. It is past time
for them to be released back to their
families.
Finally, let me say I believe that the
light of truth—calling attention to
these human rights atrocities—can
overcome the darkness of imprison-
ment. The voices of the families and

committing evil, should know that we
will not give up. We will not rest until
these Americans are set free.

PEARL HARBOR NAVAL SHIPYARD SHOOTING
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, 2 weeks
ago today, the State of Hawaii was in
shock as an active shooter took the
lives of two workers at Pearl Harbor
Naval Shipyard and wounded a third
worker.
Located on Joint Base Pearl Harbor
Hickam, the shipyard is a pillar of our
community. It employs over 6,400
workers who labor every day to keep
our Pacific Fleet ‘‘Fit to Fight.’’
Hawaii is a small place where we
have deep connections to one another.
Almost everyone in Hawaii either is re-
lated to or knows someone who works
on base or in the shipyard. In my State
office in Honolulu, a member of my
staff has a son who is an apprentice at
the shipyard and who was there that
day. These connections are part of the
reason why the shooting has impacted
our State so deeply. Too many families
were waiting that day for news of their
loved ones in harm’s way.
The investigation into what hap-
pened is ongoing, and there is no easy
explanation for what happened and
why.
It is clear that no community in our
country is immune from the tragedy of
gun violence. Today, I rise to honor the
lives of those we lost—Roldan A.
Agustin and Vincent J. Kapoi, Jr.
Mr. Kapoi and Mr. Agustin were both
dedicated Department of Defense—
DOD—civilian shipyard workers and
members of the International Federa-
tion of Professional and Technical En-
gineers Local 121.
Roldan Agustin was 49 years old and
lived in Ewa Beach. He was adored by
his family, who describe him as a ‘‘true
American patriot’’ who dedicated his
career to his country. After serving
honorably in the U.S. Navy, Mr.
Agustin also served in the Army Na-
tional Guard, retiring as a staff ser-
geant, having deployed to Afghanistan
and Kuwait.
At Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, he
served as a DOD civilian employee,
working as a shop planner in non-
destructive testing and a metals in-
spector.
In paying tribute to their lost loved
one, Mr. Agustin’s family said in a
statement:
He was a loving son, brother, uncle, and
friend to many. Having grown up in
Waipahu, Roldan enjoyed working on cars
with his friends and spending time with his
family and adored his nieces. We will forever
remember Roldan to be humble and honest,
and a generous and patient man.
Vincent Kapoi was 30 years old and
lived in Honolulu. He grew up in
Waianae and graduated from Kameha-
meha schools. His father, brother, sis-
ter, and sister-in-law are also civilian
employees at the shipyard, where he
served as a metals inspector appren-
tice. He was dearly loved by his family,
which includes his wife, parents, sib-
lings, aunties, uncles, grandmother,
cousins, and friends.
His wife offered these loving words:
I have been through a lot of tragedy in my
life, but nothing compares to losing the love
of your life. I will miss you truly, and I will
always love you Vincent J. Kapoi Jr.
His sister Theona said in a family
statement:
He will always be that easy going, fun lov-
ing, ‘‘let’s do this’’ man that will remain in
our hearts. There are so many unanswered
questions. We all have to be honest, it
changes nothing because we can’t bring him
back. What we must do is honor his memory,
keep him alive in our hearts.
I also want to honor Roger
Nakamine, who was wounded in the at-
tack. Mr. Nakamine was working as a
civilian apprentice at the shipyard
when he was wounded.
Upon leaving the hospital about a
week after the attack, Mr. Nakamine
said:
My family and I would like to express our
gratitude to the first responders and the ex-
pert medical staff at Queen’s, as well as to
all the friends and extended ‘ohana who have
been reaching out to offer their support
physically, emotionally and spiritually. Our
deepest condolences go out to the friends and
family of Vincent Kapoi Jr. and Roldan
Agustin.
Roldan and Vincent, like thousands
of their fellow workers, dedicated
themselves to the shipyard’s critically
important mission of repairing, main-
taining, and modernizing the U.S. Pa-
cific Fleet in defense of our country.
In recognition of their service and in
keeping with the words of their fami-
lies, I ask all my colleagues to join me
in honoring the lives of those we lost:
Roldan Agustin and Vincent Kapoi, Jr.
This is a photograph that depicts the
memorial, which was set up the day
after this tragedy, where friends and
family brought lei to honor their fallen
heroes, their loved ones.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana.
5G
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise
briefly today to thank a number of my
colleagues—first, the senior Senator
from Mississippi, ROGER WICKER, who
has offered a bill called the 5G Spec-
trum Act.
I have offered a bill pertaining to the
5G spectrum, as well, and my two
Democratic friends, Senator SCHATZ
and Senator CANTWELL, have offered a
bill on that subject as well.
We have been working enthusiasti-
cally and in good faith for some time
to try to work out our differences on
this legislation so that we could pass it
this calendar year. I regret that we are
not going to be able to work out our
differences for the moment, but we are
going to continue our efforts in good
faith.
The good news about all this legisla-
tion is that we all agree that the FCC
should conduct a public auction of the
5G spectrum.
What does that mean? We all have
heard about 5G. It is extraordinarily
fast internet—100 times faster than we
have right now. But in order for 5G to
work, there is a certain part of our
spectrum, or our radio waves, if you
will, that the telecommunications have
to use to deliver the 5G service. It is
called the C-band.
Of course, when we communicate be-
tween and among each other on the
internet or by cell phones through
wireless technology, all we are doing is
sending electromagnetic radiation or
radio waves from my device to your de-
vice. It is obviously more complicated
than that, but at its fundamental level,
that is what it is.
These radio waves and the airwaves
through which though radio waves
travel—this electromagnetic radi-
ation—belong to the American people.
It is called spectrum, and that is what
we mean when we talk about 5G spec-
trum. We can’t lose sight of that fact.
The wireless telecommunication
companies provide an extraordinary
service. They are going to make 5G
possible with the help of the U.S. Gov-
ernment and our other forms of govern-
ment, but we cannot lose sight of the
fact that none of this would be possible
without that spectrum, and that is
owned by the American people. That
spectrum is essential.
As a result of the efforts of some
swamp creatures both in and out of
government, we came that close to
having this spectrum, which belongs to
the American people and is worth as
much as $30 billion to $60 billion, given
away in a backroom through a private
auction to three satellite companies
that happen to be domiciled in foreign
countries.
The excuse given was that these
three foreign satellite companies can
conduct an auction themselves and al-
locate it to the American tele-
communication companies that need it
for 5G faster than the FCC can, even
though the FCC has only conducted
about 100 of these public auctions gen-
erating about $123 billion for the Amer-
ican people. Why? Because the Amer-
ican people own the spectrum that is
being auctioned off. It is theirs. But
there was a proposal that came that
close to passing the FCC to just give
this spectrum to these three companies
and let them keep the $30 to $60 billion
that the spectrum auction would have
generated and let them decide who was
going to get to participate in the 5G
throughout our country.
I thank the FCC. Fortunately, the
FCC, at the last minute, said no, and I
want to thank them. Hence, we have
the legislation by Senators WICKER,
CANTWELL, SCHATZ, and myself, and the
good news about the legislation is that
it would require a public auction by
the FCC of the spectrum that belongs
to the American people. The auction

would be open to anybody who wants to
bid. There would be a fair and level
playing field, and it would be con-
ducted in front of God and country in a
public meeting. The best way to resist
temptation is a strong set of values, a
proper upbringing, and witnesses.
There will be witnesses to this auction.
What we cannot agree on is how
much money, if any, to give to the for-
eign satellite companies. You ask: Why
should we give them a dime? Well, the
foreign satellite companies, the three
companies to which this spectrum was
almost given, are currently using this
spectrum. They don’t need all of it.
They don’t even need close to all of it,
but they have been using it for a num-
ber of years. The FCC just gave it to
them. They didn’t pay a dime for it.
Now, I am not criticizing. They put it
to good use, but they don’t own it.
They don’t have a license. They have
sort of a 30-day, month-to-month lease.
That is the way I think of it. And the
lease agreement says that the FCC can
take it back any time it wants to.
Since the satellite companies have
been using the spectrum and they have
customers, we want to be fair to these
companies. Certainly, when we decide
how to allocate the proceeds of the
public auction in front of God and
country, which the FCC is going to
conduct, we certainly want to consider
the satellite companies’ interests. But
I am not going to support giving them
half of the money this auction gen-
erates because this money belongs to
the American people. It can be used to
extend 5G and other forms of
broadband to those of us who don’t live
in major cities but happen to live in
rural areas and are all still very much
Americans.
So I rise today to say thanks to Sen-
ator WICKER, and I mean that from the
bottom of my heart. I learned so much
from working with him. I thank Sen-
ators CANTWELL and SCHATZ. We are
going to keep working toward a com-
promise in a way that will allocate this
money to everybody fairly and effi-
ciently.
I am going to end as I began—that
first and foremost in my mind is the
American people because the American
people own this spectrum.
I don’t own this spectrum. The U.S.
Senate doesn’t own the spectrum. The
three foreign satellite companies don’t
own the spectrum. The FCC doesn’t
own the spectrum. The telecommuni-
cations companies, for which we are
grateful, don’t own the spectrum. The
American people own the spectrum,
and the vast majority of the money
generated by this public auction should
go to them.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota.
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, before I
begin my comments about an upcom-
ing nominee, I want to say in response
to Senator KENNEDY that I agree 100
percent. Thank you.
NOMINATION OF DANIEL MACK TRAYNOR
Mr. President, later today the Senate
will have the opportunity to vote on
President Trump’s second nomination
to the U.S. District Court for North
Dakota. My friend, Dan Traynor, has
been nominated and we will be voting
on his confirmation to be district judge
for our district.
I have known Dan for a long time.
That is why I was honored to rec-
ommend him to the President and
pleased when the President nominated
him earlier this year.
Dan received his bachelor’s degree
from the University of North Dakota
and his jurist doctorate from the Uni-
versity of North Dakota School of Law.
He clerked for the legendary chief jus-
tice of the North Dakota Supreme
Court, Gerald VandeWalle, before head-
ing to Devils Lake, ND, where he
joined his family’s law firm and where
he works today.
Since that time, he has spent a cou-
ple of decades in various capacities,
practicing various types of law, includ-
ing being the assistant city attorney
for Devils Lake. His extensive criminal
and civil experience both as a pros-
ecutor and defender in State and Fed-
eral courts and also in Tribal court are
the main qualifications I think he
brings to this important position.
Again, I am honored to support him.
He has tried about 80-plus cases to a
verdict or judgment or to a final deci-
sion, which I think is very good experi-
ence for somebody who is then going to
stand in judgment. In addition, the
ABA gave him a unanimous ‘‘well
qualified’’ rating. He has also been rec-
ognized since 2015 as a ‘‘super lawyer.’’
In 2017 he received Martindale-Hub-
bell’s ‘‘AV Preeminent Rating.’’
So Dan’s academic record, experi-
ence, and qualifications are more than
adequate to be a good district judge.
What makes him an exception is that
Dan and his wife Trish, who is an Air
Force veteran, are raising a beautiful
family and are what we call pillars of
their community and our State. As for
Dan’s family, his mom and dad, Jack
and Jane, I know quite well, and they
are what we would call legends in their
community and in our State.
The bottom line is that Dan is emi-
nently qualified in every way, includ-
ing possessing the character, de-
meanor, and temperament, as well as
the intellectual capacity, to be an ex-
cellent judge. I look forward to voting
for him, and I urge my colleagues to do
the same.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
LANKFORD). Without objection, it is so
ordered.
BIPARTISAN AMERICAN MINERS ACT
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise
today to talk about something very
rare in Congress these days. On Mon-
day—on Monday, after 4 long years of
working hard through many uncertain-
ties, Congress came together—Demo-
crats and Republicans—to secure
healthcare and pensions for our Na-
tion’s coal miners. We did our job. This
confirms to me that we can do so much
more. This is so important.
It was the coal miners of America
who made us look beyond politics.
These were hard-working people. They
weren’t Democrats or Republicans;
they were hard-working Americans
who built America.
I want to give my sincere thanks to
all of my colleagues for putting par-
tisan politics aside and for rising above
the divisiveness and tribalism in order
to keep the promise that was made in
1946.
Over 70 years ago, President Harry
Truman recognized the importance of
the workers who produced the coal for
this country. After World War II, we
had to keep this economy moving, we
had to keep it churning, and we
couldn’t do it without the energy. Coal
was basically the driver of this at that
time, and there was a promise that the
government would guarantee our brave
coal miners benefits in return for their
services. This agreement was a sacred
promise between workers and our coun-
try, and it captured the very best of
our American values.
This week, we kept the promise by
including the Bipartisan American
Miners Act in the end-of-the-year fund-
ing bill. We kept our promise to 13,000
retired coal miners and their families
who will not lose their healthcare by
the end of the year. We kept our prom-
ise to the 92,000 coal miners and their
families who will not see their pensions
drastically reduced starting next year.
Coal miners are the most patriotic
people in America. They have done the
heavy lifting. They have done every-
thing that has been asked of them by
this country. They provided the energy
that made us the greatest country on
Earth and the superpower—the only su-
perpower in the world today.
Because of what they have done for
our country, we have won two World
Wars. We have built iconic American
cities, and we have a strong middle
class. They continue to provide the re-
sources that make us the energy leader
of the world, all while advancing the
American dream.
The journey has not been short, and
it sure hasn’t been easy. In 2015, we
knew the United Mineworkers of Amer-
ica’s 1974 pension plan was severely un-
derfunded. Unlike other public and pri-
vate pension plans, the 1974 pension
plan was well managed and funded
prior to the crash in 2008—the eco-
nomic financial crisis we had—which
hit at a time when the plan was being
drawn down more than ever because
more people were retiring. The mining
of coal, with the new automation, was
being replaced, and a lot of miners
were retiring out of it. This was cou-
pled with the fact that many of the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7131
December 18, 2019
beneficiaries are often retirees whose
employers are no longer in the coal
business—companies would shut down.
In fact, there are only 10,000 active
workers for 120,000 retirees. It doesn’t
take a mathematician to figure out
that this is not going to work.
It placed the plan on the road to in-
solvency, and that was what started
the collapse. If the plan became insol-
vent, these coal miners would have had
their pensions cut, and the government
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
would have had to step in and assume
billions of dollars in liabilities. That
would have started a tumbling effect
on all of our privately insured and pri-
vate pension plans. That is what we
were trying to prevent from happening.
That is why I wrote the Miners Pro-
tection Act and introduced it with my
fellow Senator from West Virginia,
SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO, and Senators
BOB CASEY and SHERROD BROWN. It was
bipartisan from day one.
I was told to go through the regular
order, which I did. In March of 2016,
Cecil Roberts, the President of the
UMWA, testified in front of the Senate
Finance Committee, and the Miners
Protection Act was passed out of the
Finance Committee in September with
strong bipartisan support and the
chairman of the majority.
A month later, 16,300 retired coal
miners and their widows received no-
tices that their healthcare would be
terminated by the end of that year. I
knew—I knew we could not let Con-
gress leave for Christmas without fix-
ing it. This is a tactic that I haven’t
used. It is one of the rules and one of
the privileges as a U.S. Senator that
each one of us has. In December of 2016,
at that time, I said I will shut down the
government. I will make us go through
the process and stay here as long as it
will take to get this taken care of. I
wanted to make sure that not one coal
miner would lose their healthcare.
MITCH MCCONNELL would agree to
nothing more than a 4-month extension
on healthcare at that time. So 16,300
coal miners would have been forced to
sit through the holidays and another 4
months of uncertainty, not knowing
when it was going to come to an end.
You talk about cruel and unusual pun-
ishment—that was it.
Things started to look up, though. In
January of 2017, I received assurances
from then-President-elect Donald
Trump that he was committed to find-
ing a fix, but by March, 22,600 coal min-
ers received letters telling them their
healthcare would be terminated by the
end of April. By the end of April, it
would be gone.
In typical fashion, Congress waited
until the very last minute, but on May
1, we secured a permanent healthcare
fix for 22,600 retired coal miners and
their families.
Although this was a huge win, we
still needed to fulfill other obligations
and secure the miners’ pension because
it was in dire need, and it was in jeop-
ardy of being cut drastically. Now I
was more determined than ever. I
turned around and immediately intro-
duced the America Miners Protection
Act with Senator CAPITO, Congressman
MCKINLEY, and Congressman WELCH to
secure pensions for 92,000 coal miners.
Now it was not only bipartisan; it was
bicameral.
In February of 2018, I was appointed
to the bipartisan, bicameral Joint Se-
lect Committee. I had the task of solv-
ing the country’s pension crisis, includ-
ing our coal miners, with all of our
other pensioners in our Central States
who are in dire need of our help too.
The United Mine Workers pension
fund was the first fund in jeopardy. So
I made it very clear during that—I
said: If this starts tumbling, if this
goes down, we will have to count on
the PBGC, which basically is Federal
Government funded, and if that hap-
pens, we are going to put that in insol-
vency. Then everything starts tum-
bling at a much faster rate, and it
would be an absolute financial calam-
ity for this country.
Things came to a head in October of
this year. Murray Energy declared
bankruptcy just this October. The larg-
est coal producer we have for union
workers was the Murray coal company.
They declared bankruptcy. Basically,
that significantly sped up the deadline
for pensions and truly put us in a debt
spiral.
Instead of going insolvent in 2022,
which is what was predicted, the
UMWA pension fund would now expe-
dite—speed up to insolvency by 2020,
next year. Not only that, but in be-
tween the time of securing healthcare
and now three coal companies had gone
bankrupt, putting another 13,000 more
coal miners in jeopardy of losing their
healthcare, 1,000 would have lost theirs
at the end of this month and another
12,000 at the end of March.
This bankruptcy, in particular, got
the attention of many of my col-
leagues. I appreciate all of you so
much, knowing how difficult this was
going to be on so many people and
their families.
It was a call to action for Congress to
step up to the plate and honor the
promises made to our miners. In 1946,
that was the only pension system in
America that had the silver approval of
Congress and the President of the
United States—the only one.
In November, I was proud to partner
with a bipartisan group of my col-
leagues again, including the majority
leader this time, which I am so appre-
ciative of. It is an act that would intro-
duce the Bipartisan American Miners
Act that would secure pensions for
92,000 coal miners and their families
and 13,000 coal miners and their fami-
lies who would get healthcare. Even
though that was good news, we still
weren’t over the finish line.
On December 11, for the first time
since I have been here—9 years—I put a
hold on all Senate legislation. I said
there is no way I am going to go home
or anyone else is going to go home and
enjoy Christmas with their family and
New Year’s when you have this many
people in dire straits in jeopardy—peo-
ple who built America. If we can’t
stand up for them, whom do we stand
up for? So I said: This is what we are
going to do. I was very clear. I
telegraphed it by December 11. There
were no surprises.
After many negotiations with the
House of Representatives and the
White House, we finally secured a per-
manent fix in the spending deal, ensur-
ing retired coal miners will not lose
their healthcare or pensions.
Throughout all of these years, thou-
sands of retired coal miners from all
across the country have come to Con-
gress. I know you have seen them
walking around. They have their shirts
on, their proud green shirts, if they are
working. They are walking the halls,
meeting with every person in Congress
they possibly can to tell their stories
and meeting with every Member. The
reason for that is, these are people who
have truly given their heart and soul,
their blood, and their sweat to this
country, and they are just saying: This
is something we negotiated. We didn’t
take the money home. We basically in-
vested this money into our pension and
our healthcare, and now because of a
bankruptcy loophole, we are the last in
line, and we lose everything. Some-
thing is wrong. It is not who we are as
Americans.
So we worked through all of this.
They walked the halls tirelessly, fight-
ing for what they earned, for what they
paid for, and truly for what they de-
served.
This would have never happened
without their relentless dedication. I
have said this. They dedicated them-
selves religiously, for almost 4 years,
day in and day out, coming here—com-
ing here at their expense. It has been
the honor of my life to fight alongside
them. I can’t be more proud of any-
thing I have been able to do in public
service than to stand shoulder to
shoulder with the people who have
made America great. I feel so honored
to have had that opportunity.
I thank all of my colleagues, current
and former Members of this body, who
have stood with them throughout the
years, even when the going got ex-
tremely tough.
I ask unanimous consent to have
printed in the RECORD a list of all of
those who have cosponsored these bills.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, they
have all recognized, just like President
Truman, that our country would not be
where it is today without them and
that we needed to get this done—and
we did.
I want to give you a little bit of a
background and history of why this is
so near and dear to me.
My grandfather came to this coun-
try—this wonderful country, the
United States of America—in 1900 as a
baby. He started working in the coal
mines at 9 years of age. So he was able
to get a fourth grade education before
he had to go help support his family.
In 1927, he and my grandmother had
four children, and my grandmother was
pregnant with my uncle. So she would
have had four and three-fourths of a
child at that time. My grandfather
would always tell me: JOEY, we
couldn’t pay the bills at the end of the
month. He said: I never did see any
money because it was all script, and it
went to the company house or the com-
pany store. So the old song lyrics, ‘‘I
owe my soul to the company store’’—
he truly did. He just said: We can’t
make it.
He would go out, and he would tell
people: We have to do better than this.
We have no healthcare. We have noth-
ing to look forward to and we can’t pay
our bills and we are working 6 days
like dogs. He had a mule. Poppa had a
mule; he had a buggy; and he had a car-
bide light.
He would go in and have to do every-
thing. He would have to, as he would
say—he loved to say: Fire in the hole.
He would always tell me that. Basi-
cally, what he meant by that is, he
would have to go back into the mine.
He would have to get a block of coal he
was assigned to, and he would have to
drill it. He would have to tamp it and
put the dynamite in it, and he would
pack it. Then he had to go back, and he
would fire it. Then everything would
blast away, and he had to get all the
coal and load it by hand. This is what
he did from 9 years of age.
He was trying to improve the quality
of life for all coal miners. He said: This
is not right. Well, he fought for those
rights of coal miners. It is engrained in
my family history.
The rest of the story is, in 1927—with
those four children and being pregnant
with Uncle Jimmy, because he was
talking about improving the quality of
life for the people who did this unbe-
lievable work for this great country, at
a time when this country needed it,
and the industrial age was coming—on
Christmas Eve, they came to the com-
pany house where he lived and rented,
took all of their furniture and threw it
in the middle of the street. They threw
them out because they said he was an
organizer.
Papa was a survivor. He was just try-
ing to survive, and he wanted other
people to have the same quality of op-
portunity to survive. I know this is in-
grained in me. Let me just tell you,
when you saw these miners and you
saw the fight they had in them, that is
why. There is still more that we have
to do. We have to do much more.
If you want to stop this from con-
tinuing and repeating itself in so many
different professions, we have to
change the bankruptcy laws in Amer-
ica. We cannot allow the bankruptcy
laws in this country that put hard-
working people—that take money out
of the paychecks of hard-working peo-
ple and let people from Wall Street
come in and take over—through hedge
funds or whatever they do—and rob
them and put them at the back of the
line.
Every working person in America
who pays in out of their paychecks and
their sweat and their blood and their
hard work should be at the front of the
line getting equal treatment, not just
the financial institutions. That is why
I am asking in a bipartisan way that
we make sure we protect the people
who continue to make this country go
and make this economy turn. We can
do that in this body and nowhere else.
In January, when we get back from
recess, I will be working with my col-
leagues to move this legislation
through Congress because if we cannot
continue to stand for American work-
ers ahead of the almighty dollar and
Wall Street greed, what in the world
are we here for? What is our purpose?
How do you go home and look at peo-
ple? ‘‘So sorry you lost everything. I
wish we could do more.’’ Well, we can
do more. We just showed them we can
do more for the miners. Let’s make
sure every working person is protected.
I have always said that we must set
our priorities based on our values. If
you can’t set your priorities based on
your values, you better check the box
in the morning before you go to work.
We have done that with the fight for
our coal miners, and we will continue
to do that for all American workers.
By working together across party
lines since 2016, we have been able to
secure lifetime healthcare benefits for
36,000 coal miners and their families.
We have also secured pensions for 92,000
miners and their families. Most of
these pensions are going to widows.
Their husbands have passed away. Do
you know what the average pension for
a coal miner’s widow is today? It is less
than $600. She doesn’t have a portfolio.
She doesn’t have investments in the

stock market. She has Social Security
and that $590 pension, and they want to
take that away.
That is what we fought for. That is
why every one of us should be proud,
Democrats and Republicans. We did our
job because we stood here as Ameri-
cans. We stood here representing Amer-
ica, not representing our parties and
our tribal interests and not con-
demning each other. We did this work-
ing together, and we can continue to do
a lot more.
Again, I thank all of my colleagues. I
thank Cecil Roberts, president of the
United Mine Workers, for being shoul-
der to shoulder all the way with us. I
thank all the coal miners and their
families, my colleagues in the House
and the Senate, and President Trump
for coming together to keep the prom-
ise that we have all made and that we
should continue to make and keep.
I thank you all very much from the
bottom of my heart. Merry Christmas
to all, and to all, a good night. This has
been very emotional, as you can tell. I
know what this place can do. I have
been here long enough that I have
heard enough.
When I was Governor of the State
and BOB BURR was sitting in his seat
over there, I saw the good that came
from him. It was basically all of us. Ev-
erybody in here has good in them or
they wouldn’t be here. Everybody came
here for the right reason or they
wouldn’t have gotten here. This is not
an easy place to get to, and by golly,
when we get here, we try to do the
right thing, and we did it. I can go
home and you can go home, and we can
be proud of what we did here. We fi-
nally did the job we were asked to do,
and I want to continue doing that with
you.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
RECOGNIZING GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I
start by thanking my friend and col-
league from West Virginia, Senator
MANCHIN, for his remarks and for his
steadfast support for workers through-
out the United States of America and
for working to try to bring us together
in a bipartisan manner to get things
done in the United States.
I rise today to give thanks to all who
serve our country in uniform and as ci-
vilians. Even as partisan division and
anger seem to reach new depths every
day, Democrats and Republicans have
remained united in our support and our
high regard for our fellow Americans
who honorably serve in the U.S. Armed
Forces. Those who serve have earned
every measure of gratitude shown to
them by friends and neighbors and by
all of us here in the Congress.
Other public servants deserve our
thanks as well, but unfortunately, sup-
port for them is not nearly as unani-
mous or as universal. I will focus the
remainder of my remarks on them.
While they do not go into combat, they
share the same dedication and love of
country as those who do. Many of them
also go into harm’s way—law enforce-
ment officers, diplomats in war-torn
lands, smokejumpers fighting forest
fires—and all of them swear an oath to
our Constitution, just like our troops
and just like Members of Congress.
I am talking about Federal civil serv-
ants. These dedicated public servants,
men and women, are not normally pub-
lic figures, but the Nation saw their
strength and their character at the
witness table in last month’s House im-
peachment hearings, Americans like
Laura Cooper, David Hale, George
Kent, Bill Taylor, Jennifer Williams,
Marie Yovanovitch, all of whom have
served in nonpolitical positions for all
or most of their careers. All of them
testified before Congress under sub-
poena.
These are just a few of the 2.1 million
Americans who make up the Federal
civil service and the Foreign Service.
They work together here at home and
abroad in every field of endeavor and
on behalf of all of us. For example, bud-
ding entrepreneurs can call on Small
Business Administration loan officers
for help accessing capital and foreign
commercial service officers to help sell
their inventions to the world. Farmers
know that the Natural Resources Con-
servation Service employees can help
them keep their land productive for the
long term. Foreign agricultural service
diplomats help American farmers make
a living feeding the world.
Yet, too many of our colleagues, in-
cluding many on the other side of the
aisle, have defamed public servants and
now accuse those who testified in the
House of attacking the President. That
accusation has it exactly backward.
The modern civil service was created
after an attack on a President in order
to prevent future attacks on Presi-
dents. Yes, President Garfield was as-
sassinated in 1883 by a disgruntled job
seeker.
In those days, each President handed
out most of the Federal jobs, often
based on political allegiance more than
skill. Imagine if that system still ex-
isted today—small business loans going
only to campaign aides, law enforce-
ment protecting only certain commu-
nities that voted for the President, and
farm assistance being denied to those
who backed the wrong Presidential
candidate. Countries today with cor-
rupt systems like that are among the
poorest on Earth. None of this came to
pass in America because the President
who came after Garfield, Chester A. Ar-
thur, signed a law creating the modern
civil service.
Today, the President still has the au-
thority to make political appointments
to the most senior positions in the ex-
ecutive branch, but the overwhelming
majority of positions are career civil
servants who are hired based on merit,
not political connections. The diplo-
matic corps was similarly professional-
ized in the decades that followed.
Put simply, that swamp was drained.
Now other swamps have arisen, and ac-
tions like campaign finance reform are
badly needed to address them, but pro-
fessional civil servants are not the
problem. In fact, since the civil service
and Foreign Service were created, they
have risen to every challenge. They
mobilized America’s resources to pro-
tect the public health and to beat back
the Great Depression and wage war on
fascism and on poverty.
Over the last half century, as the
number of Americans they are serving
has grown by more than 120 million,
the number of civil servants has re-
mained flat. That is doing a lot more
with less.
If problems arise in the conception or
execution of Federal programs, they
must always be acknowledged and they
must be fixed. Congress works hard to
do that, often with the help of whistle-
blowers who raise the alarm about
great fraud, waste, and abuse.
But some of my colleagues and our
predecessors have made the terrible
mistake over the last 40 years of sys-
tematically disparaging all ‘‘bureau-
crats.’’ This causes incalculable harm
by turning good people away from pub-
lic service and demoralizing those who
are there. It hurts dedicated public
servants to hear ‘‘bureaucrat’’ spat out
as some kind of insult when the Sen-
ator or candidate doing so was prob-
ably more upset by the policies they
were directed to implement than the
civil servants implementing those poli-
cies.
Of course, the attacks and criticism
leveled against Federal employees in
the past were a lovefest compared to
the hostility demonstrated by this ad-
ministration and this President—as-
saulting them with name calling, as-
saulting bargaining rights, and even
moving offices 1,000 miles away to get
people to quit.
A new report by the Partnership for
Public Service finds plummeting mo-
rale at the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture driven by a huge decline in
scores at the USDA’s Economic Re-
search Service and the National Insti-
tute of Food and Agriculture. The
Trump administration did not like the
reports that those researchers at those
agencies were publishing, and they
punished them by suddenly moving
their jobs halfway across the country
and in the process lost hundreds of ex-
perienced, knowledgeable Federal em-
ployees in the area of agriculture. The
vast majority of staff at those agencies
lost their jobs when they decided not
to move, and many of their jobs now
remain unfilled. This has needlessly
caused an upheaval that is delaying all
sorts of reports on which those in the
farming economy rely.
This administration’s hostile atmos-
phere has been cited as contributing to
a 61-percent increase in civil servants
resigning during the first 18 months of
this administration, including almost
1,600 leaving the EPA. Nearly half of
our most senior Foreign Service offi-
cers left the government during Presi-
dent Trump’s first 2 years, along with

many midcareer diplomats. Applica-
tions to the Foreign Service are at a
10-year low during this Presidency—a
hollowing out at every level. It will
take a generation to recover.
But as vicious as the attacks on Fed-
eral employees have been during the
first 3 years of this administration, in
recent months, we faced an even more
insidious threat from a President who
incites his followers to violence in one
breath or tweet and spews venom
against individual—individual—public
servants by name in the next. These
verbal assaults have led to harassment
of government employees, like those
who appeared as witnesses in the
House. The President’s supporters have
acted, in many cases, on his
incitements. There have been at least
29 criminal attacks or threats pros-
ecuted in our courts where the
attacker was echoing the President’s
rhetoric, according to one analysis.
This need to maintain support for
our Federal employees is going to be
especially important in the next sev-
eral months when events will unfold
that are sure to evoke strong passions
across the political spectrum and
around the country.
First, the election season is heating
up, as will, no doubt, the President’s
criticisms of those with whom he dis-
agrees, and we are going to consider
the question in this body of impeach-
ment, as they are doing so today in the
House.
I know it is hard, but I ask my fellow
Americans to set aside for a moment
how they feel about the impeachment
case. Set that aside, and think about
the particular individuals who testi-
fied, what they did and what they did
not say. Think about Ambassador Tay-
lor and Mr. Kemp, who learned four
languages, not to seek personal wealth
or personal glory but to advocate for
our country. Think about being raised
on stories of Nazi and Soviet oppres-
sion of your parents, like Marie
Yovanovitch. No one could have fault-
ed her for seeking a more comfortable
life here. Instead, she ventured back
out to some of the most dangerous
parts of the world and sometimes at
significant personal risk to herself. She
went abroad to extend the American
people’s hand of friendship and to pur-
sue our interests. She went as the di-
rect, chosen representative of three
Presidents.
These public servants don’t have the
luxury of choosing the policies they
pursue or of just speaking their own
minds at any time. Setting aside the
personal beliefs they may hold, all the
public servants I have spoken to so far
served America under both administra-
tions of both parties. Even last month,
they did not have the luxury of speak-
ing their minds on subjects of their
choice or at a time of their choosing,
as we do right here in the U.S. Senate.
No, congressional subpoenas and their
duty to our constitutional laws com-
pelled them to testify, not to opinions
but to facts.
The witnesses spoke about their love
of country and pride in serving it. They
did not speak about political affili-
ations or show any desire to under-
mine, let alone overthrow, this or any
other President. They honored their
oath of office, just as other dedicated
civil servants and Foreign Service Offi-
cers do every day, striving to accom-
plish what Congress, the President, and
their agency leaders ask of them.
Nobody—nobody—who swears the
same oath to the Constitution, as we
do in this Chamber, should criticize
them for honoring their oath.
Far from a nefarious deep state, the
depth of knowledge, the expertise, and
the diligence of public servants show
the depth of our agencies of govern-
ment, the depth of our state. They are
the ballast that keeps the ship of state
on course.
We believe that America’s strength
springs not only from the undisputed
benefits of a free people pursuing their
ambitions and dreams but also from
sometimes harnessing those talents for
important national purposes.
We believe that America’s greatness
has resulted not only from a collection
of individuals acting alone but from
our capacity to work together for the
common good. We should not see gov-
ernment as the enemy but as the im-
perfect instrument by which we can ac-
complish together, as a people, what no
individual or corporation can accom-
plish alone.
I ask my colleagues to stop, to think
about what we have built in this coun-
try—a system of government that has
helped eradicate many diseases, sent
mankind to the Moon, built the infra-
structure to connect the continent, and
so much more. American ingenuity,
harnessed to common purpose through
government, powered these achieve-
ments.
As we look to the future, let’s con-
sider what it will take to maintain our
momentum and maintain our greatness
as a united country. It takes people. It
takes skilled people, and it takes,
among others working in our free soci-
ety, a dedicated public service. We will
lose those public servants, as we are al-
ready seeing, if people keep attacking
them.
Let’s ask ourselves a simple ques-
tion. What kind of country do we want
to be—a country that embraces all who
serve, in uniform and out of uniform,
or a country that retreats even further
into tribalism and political echo cham-
bers?
I am proud to stand with our civil
servants. In 2017, Senator SULLIVAN and
I cofounded the Foreign Service Caucus
to support our diplomats, a bipartisan
start toward turning the tide.
This week, we have taken additional
steps forward with the passage of paid
parental leave for Federal employees,
and we will pass a well-deserved pay
raise shortly. There is so much more
we can do. Senators can start right
now and take personal responsibility
for ushering in a new era of respect for
all of our public servants. I ask my col-
leagues on both sides of the Capitol to
stop the insults, stop the verbal as-
saults, and stop questioning the patri-
otism of these fine Americans.
We can fight over programs; we can
fight over budgets; but let’s not speak
ill of civilians who serve. Let’s not hurl
the term ‘‘bureaucrat’’ as a slur. Let’s
not call people in certain government
agencies ‘‘scum.’’ Let’s disagree with
witnesses without questioning their pa-
triotism.
Let’s remember that those who join
the Federal service do so out of a desire
to help their fellow Americans and that
they deserve our respect and our
thanks. If we want to know what is
really going on with the Federal pro-
gram, we should be talking to our civil
servants to get ideas about what is
working and what needs to be fixed.
They are always willing to offer their
opinions for those purposes. If you
want to root out waste, fraud, and
abuse, let’s keep open the lines of com-
munication with Federal employees
and whistleblowers. Remember that
Federal employees cannot bargain for
wages or benefits, so, instead, they bar-
gain for a workplace that works better
for the American people.
On April 19, we will mark 25 years
since the bombing of the Alfred P.
Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma
City—America’s deadliest domestic
terror attack, where 168 people per-
ished, many of them Federal workers.
As we honor all those who were killed
that day, we must come together,
across the aisle. We must reject the
idea of politically motivated violence.
And we must do it every day, not just
on the anniversary of that tragedy.
We can do this. I have confidence we
can do it because we have done some-
thing like it before. I mentioned at the
outset of my remarks our universal re-
spect for our fellow citizens and aspir-
ing citizens who serve in the military.
But it wasn’t always universally so.
During the war in Vietnam, many of
us remember how polarized and divided
our country was and how in some cases
disagreement over the war morphed,
for some, into directing anger at our
troops. This country learned from that
mistake. We turned the tide. We came
together. Now we have nearly universal
agreement that it is wrong to blame
servicemembers for carrying out deci-
sions to go to war that they had no
part in making themselves; that you
can disagree with the war but still em-
brace the warrior.
For too many of our colleagues, espe-
cially as we witness what is happening
on the other side of the Capitol, that
fallacy is playing out again today; peo-
ple are blaming and attacking public
servants for following the laws they
are sworn to uphold, for obeying lawful
subpoenas, and for doing their duty to
tell the truth.
I am an optimist, and I believe to-
day’s critics will learn from our past
mistakes and correct our approach in
the future, just as we learned after the

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa.
FIRST STEP ACT ANNIVERSARY
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am
here today to commemorate and cele-
brate the 1-year anniversary of a
groundbreaking achievement. On De-
cember 18, 2018, the Senate passed the
FIRST STEP Act. Three days later,
President Trump signed this far-reach-
ing legislation into law. The FIRST
STEP Act is the most significant
criminal justice reform law in a gen-
eration.
I am proud of the work we accom-
plished 1 year ago on the Senate floor
by voting it out of this Chamber with a
rollcall vote of 87 to 12. This historic
vote means a lot to this Senator, who
then was chairman of the Judiciary
Committee. In fact, in one of the con-
ference rooms in my office in Wash-
ington, I have the official tally sheet
from this bill’s vote framed and hung
on a wall. Now Iowans, advocates, and
those who visit my office can see this
piece of history.
Our criminal justice system is based
on the rule of law. That means when
you commit a crime, you should be
punished. But the punishment should
fit the crime. If the penalty is too
harsh, it doesn’t do any more to deter
criminal activity, and it is a bad value
for our taxpayers when you keep people
in prison if it doesn’t do any good to
have them there.
Overly harsh penalties can also make
it harder for prisoners who are trying
to change their lives to turn over a new
leaf. It is worth noting that almost all
criminals are eventually released from
prison.
Our criminal justice system must do
much more than punish and deter. It
should rehabilitate and prepare pris-
oners to reenter society. That is ex-
actly what the FIRST STEP Act does.
It gives nonviolent prisoners an incen-
tive to participate in programs in pris-
on, such as job training, drug treat-
ment programs, and counseling, which
have been shown to reduce recidivism.
The FIRST STEP Act also makes
sentencing more fair. It leaves tough
penalties in place for the worst crimi-
nals, but it reduces mandatory min-
imum sentences, giving judges the abil-
ity to tailor punishment to fit the
crime.
Today marks a very happy occasion
and a time of reflection. However, we
must remain focused on the future and
implementation of that law. With vigi-
lant and consistent oversight into the
implementation of the FIRST STEP
Act, we can ensure these goals of re-
ducing recidivism and improving our
criminal justice system are met.
I have had the opportunity to meet
with dozens of former prisoners who
have been released because of the re-
forms in the FIRST STEP Act, and I
also had a chance to meet with some of
the families. These former prisoners
are inspiring. They are finding jobs.
They are taking care of their families.
They are paying their taxes and con-
tributing to their communities. They
have told me that the FIRST STEP
Act gave them hope. It reminded them
that the rest of the country had not
forgotten about them but wanted them
to succeed.
The FIRST STEP Act gives former
prisoners a better chance at changing
their lives. Every day, there are more
success stories. No doubt, there will be
some prisoners who don’t learn a lesson
and return to a life of crime, but the
reforms we put into place have been
shown at the State level to reduce
crime by reducing recidivism. It is the
right thing to do for people in the
criminal justice system, but it is a
good value for the taxpayers, as well,
because it costs tens of thousands of
dollars to keep people in prisons.
As we commemorate the FIRST
STEP Act, it is important to acknowl-
edge that this was a bipartisan effort.
A lot of people didn’t think it was even
possible, but we did it by working to-
gether and finding a way to work out a
reasonable compromise.
First and foremost, I want to ac-
knowledge Senator DURBIN. I guess you
would call the two of us partners in
crime. There is no better advocate for
criminal justice reform than Senator
DURBIN, and this bill would never have
passed without his hard work and will-
ingness to forge this bipartisan com-
promise.
I point especially to Senator LEE be-
cause he knows the criminal justice
code inside out, and when we needed
people to tell us what we could or could
not do, what was reasonable, he had an
answer. So I want to thank Senator
LEE.
I also thank Senators CORNYN, SCOTT,
WHITEHOUSE, BOOKER, and LEAHY,
among others.
I also want to recognize President
Trump and give a sincere thank-you to
him and his team, particularly Jared
Kushner, for the support and leadership
in this space.
Today, December 18, will always be
an important day for me as a legis-
lator. I look forward to making sure
that this law is implemented success-
fully and to finding additional ways to
improve our criminal justice system.

CONDEMNING THE TERRORIST AT-
TACK AT NAVAL AIR STATION
PENSACOLA ON FRIDAY, DECEM-
BER 6, 2019, HONORING THE MEM-
BERS OF THE NAVY WHO LOST
THEIR LIVES IN THE ATTACK,
AND EXPRESSING SUPPORT AND
PRAYERS FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS
AFFECTED BY THE ATTACK
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Today we
come together to honor the courage of
our brave men and women in uniform—
our heroes—and remember the victims
of the tragic terrorist attack that took
place at Naval Air Station Pensacola
on the morning of Friday, December 6.
I would like to thank my colleagues,
Senators RUBIO, PERDUE, ISAKSON,
SHELBY, and JONES, for standing with
me today as we honor the sacrifice and
memory of the three victims and their
families.
Amn Mohammed Sameh Haitham,
known to friends and family as ‘‘Mo,’’
was just 19 years old from St. Peters-
burg, FL. He was a great athlete who
loved to make others laugh.
ENS Joshua Kaleb Watson of Ala-
bama was a 23-year-old natural born
leader and selfless volunteer who had
lifted others up. Joshua died a hero
after giving first responders informa-
tion on the shooter’s location while he
was mortally wounded.
Amn Apprentice Cameron Scott Wal-
ters of Richmond, GA, was just 21 years
old, with a contagious smile. His dream
was to serve our country.
Our sailors and law enforcement offi-
cials showed heroism and bravery in
the face of evil as they ran toward the
shooter that day, saving lives. To our
first responders who came to the swift
aid of those in need, I would like to
thank each one of them.
Today, the State of Florida stands
united around the community of Pen-
sacola and the families of victims as
we pray for healing. I join my col-
leagues as we do everything we can to
prevent future terrorist attacks.
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the
Senate proceed to the consideration of
S. Res. 457, submitted earlier today.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the resolution by
title.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read as follows:
A resolution (S. Res. 457) condemning the
terrorist attack at Naval Air Station Pensa-
cola on Friday, December 6, 2019, honoring
the members of the Navy who lost their lives
in the attack, and expressing support and
prayers for all individuals affected by the at-
tack.
There being no objection, the Senate
proceeded to consider the resolution.
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President,
I ask unanimous consent that the reso-
lution be agreed to, the preamble be
agreed to, and the motions to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon
the table with no intervening action or
debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
The resolution (S. Res. 457) was
agreed to.
The preamble was agreed to.
(The resolution, with its preamble, is
printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’)
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. I yield the
floor to Senator RUBIO.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida.
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I want to
thank my colleague Senator SCOTT for
offering this and all of our colleagues
and, of course, all of the Senators who
voted for it unanimously.
My colleague from Florida has al-
ready mentioned the three names of
those in the service of our country who
lost their lives in Pensacola. I will talk
about them more in a moment.
I do want to say a couple of things.
First, Pensacola really is one of the
hidden gems of the State that Senator
SCOTT and I represent. To understand
Pensacola, you must understand that
is it not just a city in which a naval fa-
cility is located. The Navy is very

much a part of the fiber of that com-
munity. I would almost equate it to a
college town’s relationship with a uni-
versity; that is how much its identity
is connected to this naval air station.
This attack wasn’t just an attack on
this facility, but it was an attack on
the heart and soul of Pensacola as a
community.
As I had an opportunity to visit in
the aftermath of the attack, I was not
just deeply saddened by the loss of life
but impacted, first, by the way the
community responded and, second, by
some of the stories, which I hope we
will learn more about as the informa-
tion comes out, of extraordinary brav-
ery—not just the first responders but
others who happened to be there at
that time who exhibited extraordinary
stories of heroism in the face of evil in
this terror attack. People rushed into
the building the gunshots were coming
from instead of running away as most
people would do. I want to point out
some of those things.
ENS Joshua Kaleb Watson, who was
mentioned earlier, happened to be the
officer on deck at the time of the
shooting, and he ran toward the shoot-
er and was yelling for people to get out
of the way. He actually proceeded to
tackle the killer and fought him in an
attempt to disarm him, all while being
shot at least five separate times. He
was wounded, but he, nevertheless,
happened to make his way out to flag
down first responders and be able to
give an accurate description of the
shooter, which ultimately allowed him
to be neutralized.
Amn Mohammed Haitham’s family
moved to St. Petersburg from New Or-
leans after Hurricane Katrina. His
school’s assistant principal called him
‘‘the Perfect One’’ because he was a
good student, a track star, and basket-
ball player. This is a quote from the as-
sistant principal:
[He] would walk into any room and it
would light up. He had this magnetic person-
ality—big smile, always happy. And people
would always gravitate toward him.
His commanding officer told his fa-
ther that it was his son Mohammed
who had also bravely attempted to
take down the gunman and lost his life.
Then there was Cameron Walters of
Georgia, described as ‘‘an amazing guy,
he always had something good to say
to everybody, and was always smiling.’’
The morning of the shooting, Airman
Walters was randomly assigned to
watch duty in Building 633. He had
been stationed in Pensacola for only 2
weeks before this attack.
Again, I want to thank Senator
SCOTT, my colleague of Florida, for of-
fering this. It ensures that not only
will we not forget the heroes who sac-
rificed their lives while protecting fel-
low Navy members as this tragedy un-
folded, but it also reminds us of the ob-
ligation we have to get to the bottom
of how this happened and why this hap-
pened so that it may never, ever hap-
pen anywhere again.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia.
AGENT ORANGE
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise
today to draw attention to a group of
veterans who served this country dec-
ades ago but who continue to suffer to
this day as a result of their service. I
am talking about hundreds of thou-
sands of veterans who were exposed to
Agent Orange during their service.
From 1962 to 1975, the United States
sprayed over 20 million gallons of
Agent Orange across Vietnam, Cam-
bodia, and Laos. Millions of our serv-
icemembers, not to mention millions of
Vietnamese civilians, were exposed.
Fifty years later, hundreds of thou-
sands of Vietnam-era veterans are still
paying the price.
From the start, the Federal Govern-
ment has tried to slow-walk attempts
to cover the care these veterans
earned. It wasn’t until 1991 that the VA
recognized the connection between
Agent Orange exposure and several dis-
eases and conditions, finally allowing
these veterans to seek treatment from
the VA. Currently, the list of condi-
tions at the VA stands at 14, but
science tells us the list is far from
complete.
In 2017, then-Veterans Affairs Sec-
retary Shulkin called for three more
conditions to be added to the list: blad-
der cancer, underactive thyroid, and
Parkinson’s-like symptoms. Now, these
weren’t randomly chosen. They were
conditions found by the National Acad-
emy of Science to be connected to
Agent Orange exposure.
The science was there. The VA was
there. Yet this White House and its
OMB Director, Mick Mulvaney, have
blocked this effort to expand the list of
conditions.
Do you know what the deciding fac-
tor was? It wasn’t scientific evidence.
It wasn’t the advice of VA doctors. No,
the White House decided that the cost
of providing care to 83,000 veterans suf-
fering from these conditions was just
too high, and for that this administra-
tion turned its back on 83,000 veterans
who answered the call to serve.
Unfortunately, this is just the latest
example of the Federal Government
trying to avoid paying for the care of
men and women our Nation sent to
war. My office hears regularly from
veterans facing problems like prostate
cancer, Parkinson’s, and other condi-
tions that have been linked to Agent
Orange. Time and again, we hear how
the VA tries to deny benefits on the
basis of a technicality. This is just not
right. Unfortunately, this administra-
tion is far from the first to ignore evi-
dence about Agent Orange in order to
save a few bucks.
I want to share a few stories from my
State of Virginia, where more than
204,000 Vietnam veterans currently call
home. In many cases, veterans who
were exposed to Agent Orange have
been fighting multiple administrations
to get these life-or-death benefits—ben-
efits they earned by their service dec-
ades ago.
One veteran, William Badgett of
Hampton, VA, was exposed to Agent
Orange during his service in Vietnam
with the Army. He was in the 101st Air-
borne, 1st Cavalry, where he served as
a helicopter mechanic and supply ser-
geant. He has been diagnosed with a
number of health conditions, including
enlarged prostate, osteoporosis, kidney
disease, and hardened arteries, none of
which are on the VA’s presumptive list.
While the VA considers prostate can-
cer to be on the list, Mr. Badgett’s en-
larged prostate is not presumed by the
VA to be connected to his exposure to
Agent Orange simply because it is not
cancer.
Another example: Sam Harvey from
Newport News, VA, was exposed to
Agent Orange during the Vietnam war.
He served in the U.S. Navy from 1966 to
1970 aboard the USS Constellation. He
was diagnosed with aggressive prostate
cancer. Yet, with prostate cancer being
on the presumptive list, he struggled to
get VA approval for the treatment he
needs.
Finally, I want to talk about Dorman
Watts from North Chesterfield, VA. He
suffered for years to get the disability
rating from the VA that will qualify
him for the comprehensive care from
the VA. He has prostate cancer and
heart disease and is currently under-
going radiation treatment from a pri-
vate provider. This is unacceptable.
That is why I am glad Congress in-
cluded important accountability meas-
ures as part of the Defense appropria-
tions legislation we passed this week.
Finally, after years of reluctance,
years of ignoring the science, these
veterans are going to get some of the
answers about the conditions that have
resulted from their service.
There is more than enough evidence
to expand the list of Agent Orange-re-
lated conditions. We should be thank-
ing these veterans for their service, not
nickel-and-diming them. I urge my col-
leagues to listen to the veterans in
their States, and I urge the White
House to let the VA provide these vet-
erans with the benefits they have
earned.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, fol-
lowing the longest government shut-
down in history earlier this year, it
seemed to be a bipartisan consensus
that we need to get back on track with
the regular appropriations process.
Both parties knew there was a funding
crisis at stake this fall if we could not
come together and reach a com-
promise, so this summer, that is ex-
actly what we did—or at least we
thought we did.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7138 December 18, 2019
At the time we reached an agreement
that set top-line funding levels for de-
fense and nondefense spending, there
was a promise not to derail the appro-
priations process with poison-pill pol-
icy riders, and we got it done in August
with plenty of time to spare. It wasn’t
perfect. No negotiated product ever is,
but we knew this agreement would pro-
vide us the time and the space and the
framework to get the appropriations
process back on track and leave room
for necessary debate on government
spending habits. As our national deficit
continues to grow, that could not be
more critical. I actually remember a
time when concern about the deficit
and debt was a bipartisan concern, but
apparently, it is not currently.
Before we hit the first funding dead-
line, our Democratic colleagues backed
out of the commitment they made in
August of 2019. The open debate we
hoped for did not happen. We were
forced to pass two short-term funding
bills known as continuing resolutions,
and now, here we are, just days away
from the current continuing resolu-
tions expiration, reading text of these
funding bills that total nearly $1.4 tril-
lion. We are reading these for the first
time.
When it comes to the appropriations
process, I have learned from experi-
ence; you are never going to be 100 per-
cent happy. That is just the nature of
compromise. You have got to weigh the
good, the bad, and the ugly and decide
how the scales tip. There is certainly a
lot of calculating when it comes to
these appropriation bills, but let me
start with the good. I think the na-
tional security appropriations package
goes a long way to rebuilding our mili-
tary, providing them the resources
they need to maintain readiness, and
providing our Armed Forces with the
resources they need to face growing
threats around the world. From adver-
saries like Russia and China, to rogue
regimes like North Korea and Iran, our
military must be prepared to counter a
diverse range of threats.
This funding bill will continue the
work of Congress under President
Trump to invest in our military by pro-
viding a nearly $20 billion increase over
last year’s defense funding levels. It
will provide funds to both modernize
and grow our aging fleet so we can con-
tinue to send our troops around the
world where they are needed. One of
the major challenges we face is the de-
velopment of new technologies by our
adversaries. We cannot have our en-
emies deploying hypersonic glide vehi-
cles, artificial intelligence, and missile
defense systems that rival or perhaps
surpass our own. That would be desta-
bilizing. That may produce a mis-
calculation, which would be dangerous.
This bill sends funding toward the re-
search and development of new tech-
nologies so we can stay on the leading
edge. We should not be satisfied with
anything other than America being in
the lead when it comes to our national
security.
I am glad this package also includes
a number of provisions that support
our men and women in uniform, includ-
ing a 3.1 percent pay increase, which is
the largest in a decade. Above all, this
defense funding answers our com-
manders’ request for steady and pre-
dictable funding so they can address
and plan for the threats of today and
prepare for those we will face tomor-
row.
In addition to strengthening our na-
tional security, this package will also
make our community safer here at
home. It sends vital funding to the De-
partment of Justice law enforcement
grant programs and invests $1.4 billion
in the border wall system on the
Southwest border. As a border State
Senator, I can tell you the Border Pa-
trol, whom I consider the experts when
it comes to border security, say there
are three components of border secu-
rity: There is physical infrastructure;
there is technology; and then there is
the personnel, the boots on the ground.
This appropriation bill invests $1.4 bil-
lion in this system that includes a bor-
der wall.
Despite concerted attempts from our
Democratic colleagues, the President’s
authorities to transfer funds that he
deems necessary for border security re-
main intact.
Now, the domestic spending bill
takes strides to address some other
challenges. It allows us to bolster our
fight against the opioid epidemic, ex-
pand mental health access, and im-
prove our crumbling transportation in-
frastructure. It includes $400 million
for farmers and ranchers in Texas and
elsewhere affected by drought, trade
wars, and low commodity prices. It
would also send an additional half a
billion dollars to the Army Corps of
Engineers that can be used for infra-
structure projects right here at home.
With less than a year until the next
election, it would provide more than
$400 million in additional funds to safe-
guard our election systems so that vot-
ers can head to the polls with the con-
fidence that their vote will be counted
correctly.
As we continue to bring down
healthcare costs for the American peo-
ple by providing them more choice and
competition for their premium dollar,
this legislation permanently repeals
some of the three most oppressive
ObamaCare taxes that are burdening
American families: the premium tax,
the Cadillac tax, and the medical de-
vice tax.
This bill also extends funding for
critical healthcare programs like com-
munity health centers. This is the safe-
ty net in our healthcare system, the
community health center. It is some-
thing I have long supported.
Despite pushes from our colleagues
across the aisle, appropriators also
managed to fight off an electric vehicle
tax credit expansion, which would be
nothing more than a taxpayer subsidy
for wealthy Americans who want to
purchase electric vehicles.
There are a lot of great provisions in
these appropriations bills to address
some of our top priorities, but I remain
concerned that, with some of the short-
comings, these could also be described
as the bad part of this appropriation
process.
The domestic funding bill includes a
range of controversial provisions that
will move us further away from our
goal of decreasing the national debt. It
significantly increases deficit spending
without offsets or pay-fors for long-
needed reforms for mandatory spending
programs, which are the primary cause
of our deficits and debt, accounting for
about 70 percent of Federal spending.
This bill also includes a terrible pro-
vision, which is a retroactive tax on
American energy companies. We did
this without any sort of consideration
by the committee of jurisdiction—the
Finance Committee, upon which I sit—
with no opportunity to provide amend-
ments or even a debate on this massive
retroactive tax. The only choice we are
given now that it has been included as
a result of the negotiations among five
people is the choice to vote either up or
down on this massive piece of legisla-
tion.
This bill also extends other tax bene-
fits, without addressing problems with
the Tax Code, which actually have a
negative impact on American busi-
nesses and families.
This funding bill would also extend
the National Flood Insurance Program,
which is long overdue for reforms. This
sidesteps the need for those reforms en-
tirely. The program is hemorrhaging
money, and we need to be looking at
ways to improve it, instead of con-
tinuing to flush good money down the
drain.
As I mention, we started this process
on a strong path with the budget agree-
ment that was reached in August. I
know I wasn’t alone in thinking that
would help us get the regular appro-
priations process back on track, but
things quickly took a turn—not for the
good, not for the bad—but for the ugly.
Our colleagues let government funding
come second to their disagreements
with the President. They tried to inject
the very poison pills they vowed to
steer clear of and derailed the process
that they committed to restoring.
Rather than having an open debate
and votes on spending, as we planned,
the process fell to just a handful of peo-
ple negotiating behind closed doors.
This is reminiscent of the smoke-filled
backroom deals that Congress has long
been criticized for, and we really have
no alternative but to vote up or down
on this massive $1.4 trillion spending
package without any opportunity to
debate it or, more importantly, to
change it by offering amendments.
The way I see it, this has been the
plan of Speaker PELOSI and the minor-
ity leader here in the Senate all along.
If you think about it, this really puts
the power in their hands, which is ex-
actly what they want, and they can ex-
tract concessions and other things that

are important to them, rather than
allow the process to work as it was in-
tended to do through regular order,
through the regular appropriations
process.
This also takes power from their very
own Members because no Democrat or
Republican can offer any amendment
to this which can change it at all under
this closed process. So this really isn’t
just an affront to the Members on this
side of the aisle; it is an affront to
their own Members who have no oppor-
tunity to offer amendments or have
meaningful debate and modify the bill.
Our Democratic colleagues have held
these appropriations process hostage
for the past several months. Over
what? I think that is an important
question. Well, as it turns out, it was
their obsession with .3 percent of our
Nation’s budget. That is not how this
process should work, and it is certainly
not how to make decisions that are in
the best interest of the country.
As further evidence of the rush to get
this done without adequate consider-
ation or debate or amendment, our
House Democrats even had to violate
their own 72-hour posting rule for
major legislation just to get this legis-
lation done before we leave this week.
It is frustrating to see our colleagues
across the aisle undermine what could
have been a very productive discussion
about our Nation’s spending habits,
about deficits and debt and what our
priorities should be, and, instead, chose
to move forward with these bills, which
fall short in any number of places.
I must say that the majority leader,
the Senator from Kentucky, was com-
mitted to a process of getting these ap-
propriations back on track so we could
give a voice to all Members in these ne-
gotiations and take them up in an or-
derly fashion so amendments could be
offered, and they could be debated and
voted on, all of which has now been
swept to the side.
I am also grateful for the tireless
work of the chairman of the Appropria-
tions Committee in the Senate, the
Senator from Alabama, Mr. SHELBY, as
well as the other members of the com-
mittee who have been negotiating an
agreement to support our national de-
fense and avoid book-ending the 2019
year with a second shutdown.
As we move closer to a vote on these
appropriations bills tomorrow, I am
going to continue to review their text.
They are massive pieces of legislation,
and we have only recently gotten ac-
cess to them. I will be making my indi-
vidual decision—as I trust each Mem-
ber will—on whether to support these
appropriations bills and whether they
represent the best interests of their
States and of the American people.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader.
RELIEF ACT
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is
hard to believe that in this Nation of
immigrants we have such a broken im-
migrant system, but it is a fact.
We have addressed so many problems
in this system over the years. A few
years ago on the floor of the Senate, we
passed a comprehensive immigration
reform bill, which didn’t survive in the
House of Representatives. So it is no
surprise that, on a regular basis, we
face challenges when it comes to our
existing immigration laws.
One of the most serious challenges is
the green card backlog in this country.
To try to describe it in just the sim-
plest terms, under the current law, in
my estimation, there are not nearly
enough immigrant visas—also known
as green cards—available each year.
Each year in America, there are 226,000
family green cards available and 140,000
employment green cards available.
That is 140,000 each year for a nation of
350 million people. So many of those
who are aspiring to get a green card
and ultimately move to a permanent
resident status and citizenship wait
and wait and wait for the day to arrive.
Children in many of these families
who are from workers currently in the
United States on things like the H–1B
visa age out when they reach the age of
21, and they are no longer protected by
their parents’ presence. So they are at
risk of being deported, even as they go
into their teenage years. It is a hor-
rible situation. It is really a heart-
breaking situation. I have come to
meet and know many of the families
affected by it.
We are trying to deal with this green
card backlog with the reality of cur-
rent politics in Washington. Under the
current political environment, there
are limitations on what we can do.
My response is to increase the num-
ber of green cards that are available
each year so we have more than 140,000
available. There are currently at least
800,000 people waiting for 140,000 green
cards to come up each year. As a con-
sequence, we are in a predicament,
where we don’t have nearly enough
green cards for the people who are
waiting for them.
I would increase that number, but po-
litically that is not going to happen.
The President doesn’t agree with that
position, and many Republicans in the
Senate and the House don’t agree ei-
ther.
Senator LEE and I have confronted
this issue, coming at it from different
perspectives. Initially, we were at odds
on how to approach it. I objected to a
bill he brought to the floor; he objected
to a bill I brought to the floor; and
then we sat down to talk.
The bill I brought to the floor, as I
mentioned earlier, would increase the
number of green cards, would make
sure that the families would be pro-
tected from deportation while they are
waiting and would allow them to travel
and to change jobs. That is called the
RELIEF Act. I have introduced it. It
has been introduced in the House of
Representatives by Congresswoman
SHALALA. It is a bill I still support and
would like to see pass. That is my pref-
erence.
It is not a bill that would pass in the
Senate at this time, so Senator LEE
and I sat down to try to find common
ground, if we could, on an approach
that might work to deal with the back-
log in a humane fashion and to protect
the families during the course of that.
We have come up with a proposal
which I think moves us in the right di-
rection. It is an agreement between
us—a bipartisan agreement—which we
are now hoping to offer to the Senate
for consideration as quickly as pos-
sible.
I will very quickly state a summary
of what it tries to achieve.
It protects immigrants and their
families who are stuck in the green
card backlog I mentioned. Immigrant
workers and their immediate family
members would be eligible for what is
called early filing for their green cards.
Immigrant workers would not receive
their green cards early, but while wait-
ing, they would be able to switch jobs
and travel without losing immigration
status.
The amendment includes a critical
protection from the RELIEF Act that
protects the children of immigrant
workers from aging out of green card
eligibility while the family is waiting
so they will not face deportation.
Green card set-asides for immigrant
workers stuck in the backlog overseas
are provided. The amendment reserves
4,600 green cards on an annual basis for
immigrant workers stuck in the back-
log overseas and not eligible for early
filing. The number is based on the ac-
tual or, at best, approximate number of
the actual number of people who ap-
plied for employment green cards from
overseas each year.
Third, it addresses abuses in H–1B
temporary work visas. The first thing
Senator LEE and I want to make clear
is that we are committed, first and
foremost, to American workers getting
jobs.
In those circumstances where Amer-
ican workers with certain skills are
not available, we have what is known
as the H–1B visa. Working with Sen-
ator GRASSLEY, what we tried to do is
to come up with a bipartisan way of
strengthening that system.
Included in the strengthening of this
amendment is a 50–50 rule, which says
that the amendment would prohibit a
company from hiring additional H–1B
workers if the company’s workforce is
more than 50 employees and more than
50 percent are actually temporary
workers. I personally believe those
companies are suspect, and this bill
raises that question. The 50–50 rule, as
I mentioned, is from a bill Senator
GRASSLEY and I introduced. It was part
of comprehensive immigration reform.
The reality is, there is abuse in the
H–1B system. We don’t try to solve
every aspect of it, but we do address
what we consider to be one of the start-
ing points of the problem we currently
face.
Here is where we are. Senator LEE
and I have reached a bipartisan agree-
ment on what we think is a reasonable
approach, and we want to make sure it

is acceptable to our colleagues to move
forward.
I have been working on the Demo-
cratic side; Senator LEE has been work-
ing on the Republican side. We don’t
believe we can get it done at this very
moment, but we are hopeful to get it
done very quickly. The reason is obvi-
ous. These families affected by this
backlog are really going through hard-
ships and concerns no family should
face. The sooner we resolve them, the
better.
As I have talked to many of these
families, they have asked: Why don’t
you sit down with Senator LEE to see if
you can reach an agreement? I did. We
have. Now I hope we can move forward.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from the Utah.
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, it has been
an honor and privilege to work with
my friend and distinguished colleague,
the senior Senator from Illinois, on
this important project.
I have been working on bringing
about an end to the arbitrary per coun-
try caps put in place on employment-
based green cards for nearly the entire
9-year period I have been in the U.S.
Senate. At no point has it been an easy
process. These are significant and
weighty issues, and they require atten-
tion.
Senator DURBIN and I have spent the
last couple of months negotiating in
good faith with a lot of energy and a
lot of time and attention given to the
project not only by the two Members
involved, Senator DURBIN and myself,
but also by our very dedicated and de-
voted staffs who have really put a lot
of shoe leather, sweat, blood, and tears
into this effort.
I am grateful to Senator DURBIN for
being willing to work with me on this.
I have enjoyed working with him over
the years on a number of projects, in-
cluding the passage just about a year
ago—almost exactly a year ago—of the
FIRST STEP Act. This was the result
of a project that Senator DURBIN and I
had been working on for 8 continuous
years up until that point, culminating
in a lot of proposals, including things
like the Smarter Sentencing Act, the
Sentencing Reform and Corrections
Act, and, ultimately, the FIRST STEP
Act. Like I said, that was passed al-
most exactly a year ago.
At no point in that process was there
an easy path forward, an easy path to-
ward victory. Yet he and I remained
united in our desire to see something
get passed.
Senator DURBIN and I, along with our
staffs, have put a lot of energy and at-
tention into this effort as well to try to
bring about a resolution of the problem
created by the arbitrary per country
caps placed on employment-based im-
migrant visas.
I am very pleased with the outcome
of those negotiations. I am very con-
fident that this is something we can
get passed into law. He and I are going
to continue to work together. I am
going to make sure we have the buy-in
we need. I want to make sure the co-
sponsors of the legislation are com-
fortable with what we have negotiated
and that they understand it.
To that end, I thank the Senator
from Illinois and his staff and also my
own staff for working on this. I have
every hope, expectation, and con-
fidence that this is going to result in
something that can pass—something I
believe that can—and will soon pass
with the unanimous support of the
Members of this body.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.

ator from Maryland.
SECURE ACT
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, several
times on the floor of the Senate I have
talked about the issue of retirement se-
curity. It has been a priority for me
during my entire career in the U.S.
Congress.
When the United States has led the
world in just about every economic in-
dicator, there is always one in which
the United States is not doing well;
that is international savings, particu-
larly retirement savings.
When we take a look at recent fig-
ures, we find that 48 percent of those
who are near retirement—over 55 years
of age—have zero amounts in retire-
ment funds. Almost half of our near el-
derly have no retirement funds and
pensions at all. Twenty-nine percent
have zero savings. So we need to do a
lot better.
The issue is very much compromised
because we have seen a major trend in
the employment world from defined
benefit plans to defined contribution
plans.
In the defined benefit world, the em-
ployer guarantees certain benefits to
their employees who take the risks of
the market. In a defined contribution
plan, it requires the employee to put
his or her own money aside and be dis-
ciplined in order to do that. As a re-
sult, we find less retirement security
for many wage earners today. This puts
pressure on our Social Security sys-
tem.
Social Security is a very, very impor-
tant program, but it is only supposed
to be one leg of a three-legged stool of
retirement security, including private
retirement and private savings.
We have responded in the past, and
we have taken action. I am very proud
of the work I first started doing in the
House of Representatives with then-
Congressman ROB PORTMAN. The two of
us worked on pension legislation. We
were able to get it enacted, and it made
a big difference.
I hope we will be voting on these Om-
nibus appropriations bills tomorrow.
We are going to have a chance to take
a major step forward on retirement se-
curity with the passage the SECURE
Act.
The SECURE Act, Setting Every
Community Up for Retirement En-
hancement Act, is a bill that was first
acted upon by the Senate Finance
Committee back in 2016, so this has
been a long time in coming. It passed
the House of Representatives by a vote
of 417 to 3, so you see that there is very
strong bipartisan support for this next
chapter in retirement security. It ex-
pands opportunities for Americans to
increase their retirement savings and
improve the portability of lifetime in-
come options.
Many provisions are included in the
SECURE Act. I want to talk about just
a few, several of which I was very
proud to be part of working to include
within the SECURE Act.
First, for the first time in many
years, we do something about the re-
quired minimum distribution. Under
current law, once you reach 701⁄2 years
of age, you are required to take out a
certain amount of your retirement in-
come. The problem with that is, people
are living longer and longer and longer,
and their retirement income becomes
inadequate the longer they live. They
may have planned to live to be 80, 85,
or 90 but find they still have an active
lifestyle well beyond that. The required
minimum distribution works against
them being able to maintain an ade-
quate amount of retirement funds for
later in life.
This bill takes a step forward in in-
creasing the date in which you are re-
quired to take out a minimum distribu-
tion to 72 years of age.
We are now also providing retirement
opportunities for part-time workers.
This is a major improvement on our re-
tirement programs. I might tell my
colleagues that part-time work affects
women much more than men. This is
something that was long overdue, and I
am very pleased that this is also in-
cluded in this legislation.
Part of the legislation that Senator
PORTMAN and I have worked on deals
with the fact that we have defined ben-
efit plans that are available today, but
in some cases employers have found it
impossible to continue these plans for
new employees. These are called
‘‘closed plans.’’
Well, these defined benefit plans are
still there to protect those who were
enrolled in the plan before they became
closed. Here is the problem. As more
and more people are employed by the
company who are not in this plan and
more of the people who were in the de-
fined benefit plans are no longer
around, the nondiscrimination rule
test is much harder to be met, and, as
a result, these plans may have to be
frozen or canceled, and that would be
to the detriment of those who are cur-
rently protected under these closed
plans. I have been told that as many as
400,000 workers would risk losing bene-
fits by the end of this year if we do not
take action to change the non-
discrimination rules in regards to these
closed plans. The SECURE Act includes
the provision to do this. I was very
happy to work with Senator PORTMAN
in getting that done. That is included

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7141
December 18, 2019
in this legislation, and it is very impor-
tant that we enact it before the end of
December.
There is a provision in here that I
worked on with Senator ROBERTS, a bi-
partisan proposal to deal with church
pension plans. We have had a church
pension plan on the books for many
years, but we have gotten inconsistent
IRS regulations as it relates to the
management of these pension plans,
particularly when you are dealing with
church-affiliated institutions, such as
daycare centers or nursing homes. This
legislation will clarify that so that
these church plans can continue. It af-
fects thousands of workers, and it
makes a positive difference on retire-
ment security.
The SECURE Act also includes a pro-
vision that will exempt State and local
firefighters and emergency responders
from income tax liability that was
never intended on some pension plans.
All of that is included in the SECURE
Act, and it will help a great deal in
dealing with the issue I raised at the
beginning of my remarks, retirement
security for individuals.
Now, we will get that done, I hope,
this week. We expect to vote on the
bill, hopefully, within the next day.
That will be a major step forward for
retirement security, but it is not the
end. We have to do a lot more, and that
is why Senator PORTMAN and I have
filed the Retirement Security and Sav-
ings Act. That is a bill that contains
almost 50 different provisions. Some
are included in the SECURE Act, and
we are grateful for that, but most are
not. What is included in the Retire-
ment Security and Savings Act builds
on the SECURE Act to provide greater
opportunities for retirement security.
Let me just give you a couple of ex-
amples. It improves the requirement
for distribution, allowing individuals
to be able to reserve more for the later
years of their life. It also provides tre-
mendous incentives for lifetime in-
come.
Here is the problem. People may have
retirement savings, and they say:
Look, I guess I will live another 15
years. So they take their money out
over 15 years, and, guess what, after 15
years, they are still healthy, but they
have no money. Lifetime income guar-
antees that you will have income
throughout your entire life. We provide
incentives in our legislation on life-
time income options for retirement op-
tions when you retire.
We also make it easier for those who
have student loans to be able to par-
ticipate in retirement security. A lot of
times, people would like to contribute
to a pension plan but they have to pay
off student loans. Well, we allow the
paying off of student loans to act as a
match for an employer’s contribution—
again, offering additional opportunities
for people to participate in retirement
savings.
We have provisions in here that par-
ticularly help low-wage workers. The
bottom line is that low-wage workers
are the most challenged in order to
participate in retirement security
plans early in life. If you start a sav-
ings for retirement when you are
young, it will produce the type of sav-
ings you need when you retire. Young-
er people have lots of obligations, in-
cluding starting a family, paying off
student loans, and all the things that
we know about. So they need incentive.
We have found that just the tax incen-
tives alone will not be enough to get
younger workers to participate in re-
tirement.
We have the Thrift Savings Plan here
for Federal workers, which is wonder-
ful, because the Federal Government
matches some of those contributions.
What we are suggesting in the bill that
we filed is expanding the tax credit
program for savings, making it refund-
able directly into retirement accounts
so that younger, lower wage workers
will participate in retirement savings.
We provide provisions in this bill
that help small businesses so small
businesses can start retirement savings
plans. All of that is included in the
next step.
So, yes, let’s approve the SECURE
Act in the budget agreement, an impor-
tant step forward, but let’s recognize
that we need to do a lot more. Let’s
work in a bipartisan manner in 2020 to
build on the success of the SECURE
Act to help Americans save for their
retirement.
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF STEPHANIE DAWKINS DAVIS
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I
rise today because I am very glad to
see the Senate moving forward in tak-
ing up the nomination of Stephanie
Davis to be the district court judge for
the Eastern District of Michigan.
Judge Davis was nominated by Presi-
dent Trump back in March to be a U.S.
district judge for the Eastern District
of Michigan. Our bipartisan Eastern
District Judicial Nominations Advi-
sory Committee strongly supported
her. She was reported out of committee
by a voice vote on May 22, and no one
has expressed any concerns about her
record, nor would they have a reason to
express a concern. She is exceedingly
qualified.
Judge Davis has been working in the
U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Eastern
District of Michigan since 1997. During
her time there, she has served in both
the civil and criminal divisions. She
has prosecuted fraud, bank robbery,
embezzlement, violent crime, public
corruption, and criminal conspiracies
involving drug trafficking and money
laundering. We are very lucky to have
someone of her experience stepping for-
ward and wanting to serve in this posi-
tion. She has also overseen community
and law enforcement initiatives and
led the office’s diversity efforts.
I have had the opportunity to meet
with Judge Davis. I came away from
my very first meeting, as well as subse-
quent conversations, being very im-
pressed with her background and her
commitment to public service. She will
be an excellent addition to the Federal
judiciary, and I urge my colleagues to
support her nomination.
I yield the floor.
NOMINATION OF ANURAAG SINGHAL
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President,
Judge Anuraag Singhal has honorably
served the State of Florida for several
years, and I proudly support his con-
firmation as a district judge for the
Southern District of Florida today. He
has built a distinguished legal career,
serving as a criminal prosecutor for
Florida’s Seventeenth Judicial Circuit
and later opening a private practice fo-
cused on criminal defense and appel-
late work. Throughout his career, he
has demonstrated a firm commitment
to the rule of law, and as Governor of
Florida, I had the distinct honor to ap-
point Judge Singhal to Florida’s Sev-
enteenth Judicial Circuit court in 2011.
I am equally honored to support his
confirmation to the United States Dis-
trict Court for the Southern District of
Florida today and know he will con-
tinue to serve our State and Nation
well.

GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise
to discuss the spending bill, which we
are about to vote on, which is going to
increase our deficit by almost a fourth
of a trillion dollars over 10 years and of
which I think I might be the first
speaker. We are going to vote on this.
We got it yesterday—Monday, maybe—
and we are going to vote on it tomor-
row.
I smile because this is supposed to be
the world’s greatest deliberative body,
and we have not deliberated one bit on
far-ranging policies. Now, by the why,
the mess is kind of bipartisan. We can
spread the blame around.
Let me bring up the heart of it. When
ObamaCare passed, President Obama
famously said it would not increase the
deficit by one dime. That is gone. I
think that replaces ‘‘you can keep your
doctor if you want to’’ as the greatest
lie. What we did today is to repeal
about $400 billion in payments to pay
for all the healthcare that is going out.
It is kind of a joke on Republicans. We
are getting ObamaCare, but we are not
paying for it.
On the other hand, as I will explain
in a second, it may ultimately be a
joke on Democrats. Now, this concerns
me because we didn’t have a committee
hearing on it, and we haven’t had a
floor debate, but we just committed
that for almost $400 billion that have
been used to fund Medicaid expansion,
people getting subsidies for their
health insurance, and many other
things, we just went poof, and it is
gone.
Now, some of it, like the health in-
surance tax, was a tax that the insur-
ance industry agreed to so that the
Obama administration would force
ObamaCare upon the rest of us. But
now that it has been agreed to and
ObamaCare is stuck, they don’t want
to pay the tax. They would rather that
go poof.
Now, people say: Wait a second. If we
get rid of that tax, maybe insurance
premiums go down. One, they don’t
guarantee it, but, secondly, what we
could have done is we could have taken
that money, created reinsurance pools
across the Nation, and that is esti-
mated to lower premiums by 10 to 20
percent. In that case, not only would
the insurance industry be fulfilling
their bargain—hey, you stick the Na-
tion with ObamaCare, but we will help
pay for it—you would actually be able
to use the money to lower premiums.
That would be something good. One,
they would have kept their word, and,
two, it would have been good for the
American patient, if you will.
The other tax that has gone just
poof—$300 billion just gone without de-
bate, without deliberation, without a
committee hearing, which is still there
on Friday, and today we walk in on
Monday, and it is poof, and we vote on
it tomorrow, and I am the first person
to speak on it—is the so-called Cadillac
tax.
Now, on the Cadillac tax, that is a
provision under ObamaCare in which
for high-cost policies, if they go too
high, you get taxed on them. The whole
idea is to encourage wiser purchasing
of health insurance. Now, frankly, I
didn’t care for the Cadillac tax. I get
the reason it was there. But 100 dif-
ferent economists have said that it
serves a purpose across the political
spectrum. My preference is that if we
had replaced the Cadillac tax, one, we
would have paid for it. We shouldn’t be
getting ObamaCare without paying for
it. Secondly, we would have gotten

some reforms. They are reforms that
actually would have been—if we were
not going to use the Cadillac tax to
hold down the cost of premiums—an-
other mechanism by which we could
hold down the cost of premiums.
Why is this important? Because not
only did we just go poof to almost $400
billion, but because healthcare expend-
itures are driving our debt and deficit.
It is not just that we lost this $400 bil-
lion. We lost any restraint upon poli-
cies going higher and higher.
Now, that is bad for the American pa-
tient. It is bad for the American house-
hold because our country will continue
its indebtedness.
I am a doctor. I know if you put more
money into the furnace, it will burn
that much higher, and now there is just
no excuse to try and rein in those ex-
pensive policies.
It is not just that. One thing that my
Republicans apparently have agreed
with Democrats on is to stop the
Trump administration from taking on
something called ‘‘silver loading.’’ It is
a little technical here, but just hang
with me. For the middle-class family
in your State who buys their insurance
on the exchange and does not get a sub-
sidy, pop, there goes their premium.
How does this happen? When the
Trump administration ended the pay-
ments from the Federal Government to
insurance companies, insurance compa-
nies figured out a way around it. They
are smart. They know how to get out of
taxes that they have agreed to pay for,
as an example. So they did what is
called ‘‘silver loading.’’ They increased
the cost of so-called silver policies on
the ObamaCare exchange. So if you are
not getting a subsidy, you are paying a
lot more. But because if you are not
getting a subsidy and you are paying a
lot more, that increased the amount of
subsidies for people who were. So if you
are, you know, getting a subsidy, you
are probably pleased with it. If you are
the middle-class person making 400
percent of Federal poverty level and
you are paying your taxes and you are
trying to do it right, you just got stuck
with a higher premium.
The administration was trying to
take it on. This deal, which we have
not discussed, which was not heard in
committee, which we have not delib-
erated on at all, says to the adminis-
tration: You can’t take that on. Yes,
that middle class family not getting a
subsidy is paying far more, but you
can’t take it on. Stand down, adminis-
tration, we are going to stick it to that
family, as well as saying poof to $400
billion.
Now, there are some other issues that
are important to me in my State. The
National Flood Insurance Program is
an important program. We advanced
some reforms that would make it more
affordable for the homeowner, more
sustainable for society, and more ac-
countable to the taxpayer. We haven’t
had anything in there. We renewed it. I
am pleased that we renewed it.
We renewed it without reforms. You
have had flooding in your State, and I
have had flooding in my State. You
have had yours in yours, and I have had
it in mine. We need that program to be
sustainable, accountable, and afford-
able. We have lost the opportunity. I
forget how many short-term extensions
we have had without reform. I think it
is like 10, 12, 14, or 16. You lose count
after a while. We have missed that op-
portunity.
So we started on Friday. Everybody
goes home except for a few people.
They work on it over the weekend,
they come in on Monday, and we get a
2,000-page bill on Monday. We will vote
on it tomorrow, and I am the first per-
son to speak on it.
Now, I understand that impeachment
is taking a lot of energy and oxygen
out of the Chambers. I understand that
a lot of attention is addressed else-
where, but all I can say is that you
have just imperiled your country’s fis-
cal health.
On one more thing before I wrap up,
there is a little bit of an irony here.
Republicans are getting ObamaCare,
but it is unpaid for. There is another
irony here as well. The courts today
ruled that the individual mandate in
ObamaCare is unconstitutional. Now, I
am not an attorney, but I gather they
did not rule that this was so-called sev-
erable.
If this is not constitutional, then the
rest can stand because we just sever it
off. Imagine this. Imagine that the
courts decide that that portion of
ObamaCare—which is related to Med-
icaid expansion and is related to the
exchanges in which people get subsidies
to buy these policies—is unconstitu-
tional but would have allowed the
mechanism by which to pay for it to
stand, because that is another part of
the law. We have just repealed that.
Why is that important? Because if this
falls, we have to have the money to pay
for a replacement.
Democrats have so long screamed
that we need to have universal access.
By the way, I am a doc. I would like ev-
erybody to have insurance. I fought for
it, and I worked for it. But the other
party, which has said this is such a
high priority, has just eliminated the
funding that could be used for replace-
ment in Texas v. Azar, the court deci-
sion that may strike down that portion
of ObamaCare.
So, Republicans, we got ObamaCare
that is not paid for. Democrats, they
may end up with no ObamaCare at all.
Patients, whether they are on Med-
icaid, getting a subsidy, or not getting
a subsidy, will lose.
I hope that we can return to being
the world’s greatest deliberative body,
but as regards that, this has to be con-
sidered a low point.
I yield the floor.

ator from Oklahoma.
IMPEACHMENT
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, it is
a historic day and busy week in the
Senate. The historic day happening is
happening just south of us right now.
There is debate in the House of Rep-
resentatives over impeaching the
President of the United States. It is
only the third time that has ever oc-
curred in our Nation’s multicentury
history.
Current impeachment conversation is
an interpretation of a phone call Presi-
dent Trump had with President
Zelensky; that if you twist that phone
call just the right way, it sounds like
he is trying to influence the President
of Ukraine, except the President of
Ukraine never said he felt influenced
by that, and they never took any ac-
tion President Trump is being accused
of. Five different meetings happened in
the days after that phone call and none
of those meetings ever included any
conversation about Rudy Giuliani or
Hunter Biden or Joe Biden. The money
did go to Ukraine in time. It was the
11th of September, and the deadline for
it to arrive was the 30th of December.
The whole time the Ukrainians, who
apparently were threatened by Presi-
dent Trump according to the Articles
of Impeachment, said they never knew
they were threatened.
I have a feeling that if President
Trump wanted to threaten somebody,
they would know it, but apparently, in
this situation, the House is currently
impeaching the President because they
perceived the President meant to do
something he didn’t actually do, when
the whole time the President said that,
no, that was never his intent. The only
one fact witness the House called
through the entire process—the one
fact witness they called—said they ac-
tually talked to the President, and the
President said: No, there is not any
quid pro quo; of course I don’t want to
do that.
But they are going through impeach-
ment anyway. That will then come to
the Senate in January, and all of Janu-
ary will be consumed with walking
through the two Articles of Impeach-
ment the House is choosing to send
over.
It is ironic to me that earlier today,
Michael Horowitz, who is the inspector
general for the Department of Justice,
was in a hearing in the Senate, talking
about the process on the Russia inves-
tigation. I happened to be on that com-
mittee as we went through the process.
It was very ironic to me today, in the
line of questions and the issues and
things that were coming up in the
Horowitz report, one of the things that
probably the media will never report
on, but Michael Horowitz, the inspec-
tor general, pulled out through this
process, was, in October of 2016, Chris-
topher Steele—famous for the dossier
that was an opposition research project
from the Democratic National Com-
mittee on President Trump leading up
to the election that was supposedly all
this dirty information about Russia.
Christopher Steele was contacted by
someone in the State Department, the
Obama-led State Department. In Octo-
ber of 2016, Christopher Steele was in-
vited to the State Department where,

SENATE
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7147
December 18, 2019
at that time, State Department offi-
cials gave Christopher Steele informa-
tion that they said was from a Turkish
businessman who had been visiting
with a Russian member of the FSB
that was derogatory to President
Trump, and they were encouraging
Steele to take that back and then use
it before the election.
The irony of the day today for me is,
while the House is impeaching the
President, at the same time that is
being debated, Michael Horowitz, the
inspector general, is giving testimony
about individuals in the Obama-era
State Department getting information
from foreign individuals, slipping it to
individuals working on the Clinton
campaign, and literally using foreign
sources to fight against Candidate
Trump from Hillary Clinton’s staff at
the State Department.
Sometimes the world feels more up-
side down than others. This is one of
those weeks. A year ago today, the
Senate was working in a bipartisan
fashion to be able to pass the criminal
justice reform bill, called the FIRST
STEP Act. It was a landmark piece of
legislation dealing with helping us in
Federal prisons deal with recidivism.
That was a good day for us in Congress.
We started getting more job training
to people who are in prison, more op-
portunities for faith-based programs in
our Federal penitentiaries—just like
they are in our State penitentiaries—
more opportunities for prisoners to
connect with their families because the
vast majority of prisoners in our Fed-
eral prisons will be released one day,
and it would be helpful if they had job
training and if they had a faith-based
background, if they choose to, and if
they have connections to make with
their families. It helps us bring down
the crime rate in the days ahead. That
was a year ago today in the Senate, in-
stead of fighting through the impeach-
ment process that is happening now.
There are a lot of people who said to
me recently that nothing is getting
done. That was true for the past couple
of months while we have been waiting
on the House to be able to move on
other issues, but this week has been a
pretty busy week moving through
pieces of legislation.
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT
Mr. President, JIM INHOFE, who is the
chairman of the Armed Services Com-
mittee, has led this Senate and has led,
quite frankly, all of Congress through a
process on what is called the NDAA,
the National Defense Authorization
Act. That got passed this week. That is
an incredibly important bill, not just
to us in Oklahoma but to us across the
Nation and for our national security. It
included things like a pay raise for all
of our servicemembers. It included ad-
ditional benefits of things going to our
family members as they move from
place to place, living with their serv-
icemember, and helping them in their
transition.
It addressed the issue of housing,
which is so important to Oklahoma, as
we have had problems with private con-
tractors at some of our bases in Okla-
homa not living up to the standards of
their contract. JIM INHOFE has been the
one actually fighting to get that fixed.
He has been the one who has taken the
lead on that.
This is incredibly important to us in
Oklahoma for our five bases and posts,
as well as our National Guard and our
reservists. Just in Oklahoma, there
will be $2.2 billion for the KC–46A re-
fueling tankers. They will be trained in
Altus, and they will be repaired and
serviced at Tinker Air Force Base. The
authorization for the T-X Program,
which positively impacts Vance Air
Force Base, is incredibly important.
The improvements to military family
housing, which I have already talked
about, included an amendment in the
bill which dealt with reservists, in
what is called the DD–214 Act of 2019. If
you are not in the military, you have
no idea what that is. If you are in the
military, you know exactly what that
is. There was a problem that guards
and reservists didn’t have the same
kind of records in the DD–214 that Ac-
tive Duty does. We are fixing that now
so that when guards and reservists get
close to retirement, their records are
all in place.
We have a continuation of the Pal-
adin Integrated Management System,
which is at Fort Sill. We have the au-
thorization of the Fort Sill barracks
that are so incredibly important to be
able to have better living facilities
there as well.
The fuels storage complex at the
Tulsa International Airport is very im-
portant for the 138th Fighter Wing of
the Air National Guard.
Language to enhance our direct high-
er authority, which is so incredibly im-
portant—we expand that again to make
sure civilians who are being hired in
places like McAlester and Tinker con-
tinue to be able to serve there. Those
civilian service folks are so incredibly
important to our national security.
APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. President, that was just in the
NDAA that passed this week. There are
12 appropriations bills we have been
working on for months that I am glad
the House has finally come to a deci-
sion to work through this impeach-
ment process, and we can actually get
on to the 12 appropriations bills. They
affect a lot of things for Oklahoma.
Appropriations bills that are moving
through tomorrow will have things like
$50 million for medical student edu-
cation. That is really important to us
for the University of Oklahoma and
Oklahoma State University in the
awards they have received for medical
education.
We have been through our share of
disasters this year in flooding in Okla-
homa. The funding to continue those
grants in that process is in this set of
bills.
We have $710 million for SAFER
grants, which deal with fire depart-
ments throughout the States. It is in-
credibly important because they are
the first responders to acts of ter-
rorism.
The ag bill itself is moving through
right now. It deals with a lot of the dis-
aster supplementals that are incredibly
important to us—in fact, to many of us
in Western Oklahoma.
This set of bills not only does a 3.1-
percent increase for our military serv-
icemembers but it also does an increase
of 3.1 percent for our civil servants,
many of them who work in Oklahoma,
and they do a remarkable job of being
able to serve our neighbors.
There are a lot of different areas that
deal with things like military con-
struction projects that are all over our
State that affect not only the military
but civilians and those who have re-
tired as well.
There are a lot of changes here, in-
cluding dramatic funding increases for
the Department of Veterans Affairs to
fulfill what is called the MISSION Act.
That allows more veterans to get care
closer to home, where they are not
having to drive 100 miles to get radi-
ology work, and they can do that in a
rural hospital close by. They can con-
nect with their family doctor, just like
their spouse does. This gives them
greater opportunity to do this.
This set of bills also deals with the
electronic logging delays that are so
incredibly important to those who are
hauling ag and livestock. This deals
with the Fish and Wildlife Service.
Those of us who are in Southeast Okla-
homa know how incredibly important
it is to resolve the American burrowing
beetle that no one else will pay atten-
tion to but is incredibly important to
us so the Fish and Wildlife Service fi-
nally gets this downlisted. This gives
the instructions for them to do this.
There are oversight dollars that are
put in place to USDA to oversee the
SNAP program, often called food
stamps, which is actually SNAP. That
program gives greater oversight to deal
with fraud so people who need the help
get the help and the people who are
abusing are confronted.
The set of bills also deals with what
is called the RURAL Act. It is really
important to our co-ops across the
State. They deal with the cost of doing
business, which continues to provide
inexpensive energy all across our
State.
The border wall funding remains. It
is the exact same dollar amount as it
was last year. That was quite a fight in
the conversation to be able to go
through the House and the Senate.
There are some who believe we should
have no fences and no barriers and
open borders. I am amazed at how
many people do not know that the last
four Presidents—now five in a row, in-
cluding President Trump—have all
built border fencing. For the previous
four Presidents, they didn’t face the
same fight that President Trump does
in building border fencing. In the pre-
vious four Presidents, it was all about
national security. It is important we

have fencing in certain areas to keep
that area secure. For President Trump,
it is suddenly a divisive issue. We
maintained that funding for the border
fence to make sure that continues
through these bills that are moving
through.
There is a repeal of what is called the
nonprofit parking tax. A lot of folks
aren’t following this, but if you work
for a nonprofit, you certainly are. It
was something that was in the tax bill
that should not have been there, and it
caused great confusion for all of our
nonprofits and all of our churches all
over the country and certainly all over
my great State.
This section is something I and CHRIS
COONS from Delaware have worked on
for months and months, to finally get
it fixed for all these nonprofits. For
those of us who know and love the
work the nonprofits do all over the
country, this is one of the prime issues
they want to finally get resolved so
they can get back to focusing on tak-
ing care of people who are homeless
and hungry and needy, rather than
having to count parking spaces and
turn in, literally, a 30-page form to the
IRS.
Finally, dealing with the medical de-
vice tax, which has lingered for years.
It is an important issue for us to re-
solve because it is raising the cost of
people getting medical devices. We did
a boost in funding for NIH, National In-
stitutes for Health. That deals with an
increase in funding in things like Alz-
heimer’s, which we should continue to
invest in. That also deals with things
in Oklahoma: some of the Oklahoma
Medical Research Foundation, Ste-
phenson Cancer Center at OU, and also
some of the rural healthcare programs,
especially dealing with telemedicine. If
you are in a rural area in Oklahoma, it
is a long way to go to get healthcare.
This bill also deals with something
called the SECURE Act. The SECURE
Act deals with seniors’ retirement.
Right now you can’t continue contrib-
uting to your IRA past 701⁄2. You are
forced to take it. Lots of folks are now
choosing to work later and later. Some
retire earlier. That is fine. That is
their choice, but for folks who choose
to retire later, they don’t want to be
forced to take their IRA. They want to
still be able to contribute. This allows
them to be able to do this.
This also allows part-time workers to
participate in 401(k) plans. It is incred-
ibly important for a lot of people just
saving for their own retirement. People
should not count on just Social Secu-
rity. People should also set aside their
own retirement funds as well in addi-
tion to Social Security. This allows
more folks to do that and to continue
doing that.
There are several things on foreign
policy that maybe some Oklahomans
are not paying attention to but are im-
portant to us—things like the F–35 pro-
gram to Turkey. It is one of the areas
that I led in this bill. It says that Tur-
key should not be allowed to continue
to have the F–35. They purchased Rus-
sian air defense systems. They are
turning toward Russia. Why would we
sell to Turkey our most precious, high-
ly technical, highly secured technology
like the new F–35 when the direction
Turkey is headed in the days ahead is
unknown? This bill stops the delivery
of the F–35 to Turkey.
This bill also finally gives victims of
terrorism their day in court. Decades
ago, victims of terrorism asked to hold
to account organizations like the Pal-
estinian Authority, or the PLO, in
areas where they carried out acts of
terrorism that killed or injured Ameri-
cans. We decided as a Congress decades
ago to allow that, but the courts
stepped in and stopped it with this lit-
tle loophole, and we, as Congress, have
never fixed it. I worked with Chairman
GRASSLEY and with multiple others to
get to a point where we can resolve
this. This bill includes the fix so that
victims of terrorism can finally get
their day in court.
U.N. peacekeeping contributions
have hit a very high number in the
years past—way beyond what was set
as the cap. This bill keeps us down to
the current cap so that we are not
overgiving to the peacekeeping oper-
ations because we also expect other na-
tions, not just the United States, to
contribute to the peacekeeping oper-
ations.
I would love to say that everything
in these bills is good, but it is not. Peo-
ple talk about making the sausage
here. Quite frankly, I go back and
think about the very first time I ever
had a bite of supreme pizza. I don’t
know what everybody’s family was
like, but for us, growing up, we got a
hamburger pizza. It was a plain one,
which was the cheapest one, or cheese
pizza. That was a very good pizza. But
I remember the first time I went some-
where and had supreme pizza, and it
was all loaded with everything on it,
and I thought that it was going to be
great—until I bit into it. I also found
out it not only had the things I liked,
but there were some things that I real-
ly, really didn’t like in that bite, and
many times the things that I really
didn’t like overpowered the things that
I did.
There are some things in some of
these bills coming up this week that I
just cannot support. While I talked
through a lot of things that are mov-
ing—and there are a lot of things mov-
ing this week—there are also some
areas like the overseas contingency
fund, often called OCO. You will hear
it. It is a separate fund outside the
budget that is supposed to be just for
taking care of our military in the fight
against Afghanistan and Iraq. We have
been dialing down the fight in Afghani-
stan and Iraq and doing less and less
and less of that. The President has al-
ready announced he is going to con-
tinue to withdraw troops in a wise way
from those areas. Yet this agreement
that has come down the pike this week
also includes not less overseas funding
but $10 billion more of the overseas
contingency fund—$10 billion more.
The wind production tax credit sud-
denly reappears. It is the zombie tax
credit that we thought was already
gone that now has just bounced back.
Five years ago, Congress agreed that
wind power was prolific around the
country, and they no longer needed a
Federal tax benefit to sustain their
business. There was an agreement 5
years ago to, little by little, wean wind
off, and 2020 would be the first year
that it would go to zero. Except in this
bill, magically, the wind production
tax credit reappears. In the year that it
was supposed to be zero, it actually
pops up to a higher amount than it was
even last year.
There are multiple different items
called tax extenders in this package.
We have additional tax dollars going to
things like race tracks for horse rac-
ing. We have tax dollars going to mo-
torsports race tracks. And we have tax
dollars going to craft beer breweries
because, I assume, craft beer breweries
can’t make it without getting tax dol-
lars from their next-door neighbor—al-
most $1 billion worth. Almost $1 billion
Federal dollars are going to help folks
who do craft brewery. I am sure the
folks who do craft brewery would love
to have the tax benefit, but I think the
Nation has not run out of beer, and we
are not in a position that we need to
make sure we subsidize that to make
sure we sustain that for our national
benefit.
The tax side alone of one of the bills
that is coming—just one of the bills
that is coming—is almost one-half tril-
lion dollars in new debt. One of the
bills has one-half trillion dollars in new
debt. For a nation that has $23 billion,
many of us were shocked late on Mon-
day night when the bill was dropped
with an additional one-half trillion dol-
lars in new debt.
There are some important things
going on this week, and there are also
some things moving through this Con-
gress that need more attention than
impeachment, and they are not hap-
pening. I hope in the days ahead, as we
debate these issues and vote on these
issues, we can deal with the things that
are good that we all look at and say
‘‘We should do that,’’ but we will be
able to pause long enough to ask
‘‘Should we do those things?’’ and
make wise decisions.
We are at the same spot we always
are. Everything gets crammed in at the
very end of the year, and it becomes a
case where, if you don’t vote for every-
thing, then the government is going to
shut down. That is why MAGGIE HASSAN
and I—the Democratic Senator from
New Hampshire—worked so hard this
year to form a bill that we call the gov-
ernment shutdown prevention bill. We
want to end the possibility that we will
have government shutdowns so that
there is not a time that we get to the
end of the year, and everyone says: You
have to vote for all this stuff or the
government will shut down and people
will be furloughed.

December 18, 2019
I would like to have a moment when
we say that we will not ever have shut-
downs again and we debate the issues
that need to be debated in the time
they need to be debated so that we
don’t dump one-half trillion dollars in
new debt on our kids and go home for
Christmas.
Let’s get some things resolved. Let’s
solve the issues, and then let’s spend
some time with our families. I think
the entire country needs to take a deep
breath from the anger and bitterness
and divisiveness. There needs to be a
little peace on Earth and some good
will toward men.
I yield the floor.

DEBBIE SMITH ACT OF 2019
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am
delighted that we last week reached a
compromise enabling Congress to send
another 5-year reauthorization of the
Debbie Smith Act to the President’s
desk this week. Both Chambers’ adop-
tion of that compromise, which passed
the Senate by voice vote last night,
with my support, signals Congress’s
continued support for the DNA Backlog
and Capacity Enhancement Program.
Earlier this year, I called for reforms
to the grant program that the Debbie
Smith Act established. These reforms,
suggested this year by the Government
Accountability Office, would require
both that the Justice Department ar-
ticulate measurable, program-wide
goals and that the National Institute
of Justice take additional steps to pre-
vent lobbying-related conflicts of in-
terest. They would not resolve every
issue with this grant program, but I be-
lieve the implementation of such re-
forms would substantially strengthen
the program. I also advocated for re-
forms, which are included in the final
legislation, that ensure the analysis of
untested DNA in sexual assault cases is
accorded higher priority under this
program.
As mentioned earlier this week, I
have called on the Attorney General to
implement several of my proposed re-
forms through administrative action. I
thank the Attorney General for com-
mitting to do so, in the attached letter
dated December 11, 2019. My letter to
the Attorney General on this subject,
dated December 9, 2019, also is at-
tached, and I ask unanimous consent
that both letters be printed in the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,
OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS,
Washington, DC, December 11, 2019.
Hon. CHARLES E. GRASSLEY,
Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
Hon. JOHN CORNYN,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY AND SENATOR
CORNYN: This responds to your letter to the
Attorney General dated December 9, 2019, re-
garding the DNA Capacity Enhancement for
Backlog Reduction (CEBR) Program. We
write to assure you that the Department of
Justice places a high priority on the Govern-
ment Accountability Office’s (GAO) reports
and recommendations. The recommenda-
tions from the 2019 GAO report regarding the
CEBR program are being addressed by the
Office of Justice Programs, and specifically,
by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ).
In particular, NIJ concurs with the rec-
ommendations in the 2019 GAO report re-
garding performance measures. To create
and implement appropriate and meaningful
performance measures NIJ has: conducted an
in-depth analysis of currently available pro-
gram performance data to identify informa-
tion gaps; made corresponding modifications
to program performance measures to address
these gaps; aligned its performance measures
with consistently articulated program goals
and permitted program activities; clearly de-
lineated between measures intended to cap-
ture the state of DNA backlog and labora-
tory throughout, and those measures in-
tended to gauge grant program impact; made
clarifications to promote consistency in
grant recipient data reporting; augmented
its measures to efficiently capture the level
of DNA funding used for outsourcing DNA
sample analysis (which accounted for ap-
proximately only 10 percent of program costs
for FY 2015 award recipients).
Consistent with the recommendations in
the GAO report, NIJ will communicate en-
hancements to DNA CEBR program meas-
ures starting in calendar year 2020 and con-
tinuing through 2020. This will occur in ad-
vance of updated performance measures that
will appear in the FY 2021 DNA CEBR Pro-
gram solicitation. Grant recipients will be
required to report against the specific ar-
ticulated updated measures thereafter.
The 2019 GAO report expressed concern re-
garding lobbying disclosure certifications
and a lack of controls to follow-up with
grantees to help ensure they are meeting
statutory requirements. As of February 2,
2019, all entities registering for federal
awards in the System for Award Manage-
ment (SAM.gov) are required to review the
Financial Assistance Representations and
Certifications required by statutes or regula-
tions in accordance with guidance under
Title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
SAM.gov registration question 8.L. ref-
erences compliance with the Lobbying Dis-
closure Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.
Under this question, the registrant must at-
test as follows:
I have read each of the certifications and
representations presented on this page. By
submitting this certification, I, <VENDOR>,
am attesting to the accuracy of the certifi-
cation and representations contained herein.
I understand that I may be subject to crimi-
nal prosecution under Section 1001, Title 18
of the United States Code or civil liability
under the False Claims Act if I misrepresent
<VENDOR> by providing false, fictitious, or
fraudulent information to the U.S. Govern-
ment.
In addition, OJP plans to send annual re-
minders to all OJP vendors with open active
awards reminding them of the disclosure re-
quirements under the Lobbying Disclosure
Act along with instructions on how to sub-
mit the disclosures.
Finally, regarding GAO’s concerns regard-
ing controls for conflict of interest and lob-
bying, OJP has historically followed Justice
Management Division procedures. However,
OJP did not have these procedures reduced
to writing, as acknowledged by GAO. OJP
has memorialized the procedures in writing,
which the Principal Deputy Assistant Attor-
ney General has approved. The procedures
are in process for implementation.
It is OJP’s intent, as evidenced by the
work already completed and the plan moving
forward, to comply with the 2019 GAO report.
We hope this information is helpful. Please
do not hesitate to contact this office if we
may provide additional assistance regarding
this or any other matter.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7150 December 18, 2019
Sincerely,
STEPHEN E. BOYD,
Assistant Attorney General.
Hon. WILLIAM P. BARR,
Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice,
Washington, DC.
DEAR ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR: We are
writing to urge your immediate adoption of
a government watchdog agency’s rec-
ommendations respecting a U.S. Department
of Justice (DOJ) grant program that makes
resources available for criminal laboratories
across the country to process DNA evidence
collected from crime scenes and criminal of-
fenders. We also request that you commit to
implement specific and measurable goals for
this program, known as the ‘‘DNA Capacity
Enhancement and Backlog Reduction Pro-
gram’’ (CEBR), by the end of the year.
The Government Accountability Office
(GAO) repeatedly has faulted DOJ’s Office of
Justice Programs (OJP) and National Insti-
tute of Justice (NIJ) for neglecting to articu-
late, in clear, specific, and measurable
terms, program-wide goals for this formula
grants program, originally authorized by
Congress under the Debbie Smith Act. The
CEBR program, which has received roughly
$1.5 billion in congressional appropriations
since its inception 15 years ago, has been the
subject of two critical GAO reports, one in
2013 and another this year.
As stated by GAO in a 2019 report on this
subject:
‘‘[T]he Office of Justice Programs (OJP)—
the primary grant-making arm of the De-
partment of Justice—has not consistently
documented program-wide goals for its DNA
Capacity Enhancement and Backlog Reduc-
tion grant program (CEBR). For instance,
OJP has documented different meanings of
‘‘capacity enhancement.’’ Additionally,
CEBR performance measures do not fully re-
flect selected attributes of successful per-
formance measures, such as having measur-
able targets. These issues hinder OJP’s abil-
ity to assess program results.’’
This is not a new concern: GAO reported a
half dozen years ago that DOJ was not doing
enough to assess the results of the CEBR
program. As stated in a 2013 report by the
Comptroller General: ‘‘NIJ has a process in
place to determine DNA and forensic pro-
gram funding priorities, but its decisions re-
garding these priorities are not clearly docu-
mented.’’ GAO noted that NIJ was unable to
articulate its rationale for how funding pri-
orities are determined, and ‘‘[w]ithout a
clearly documented process that dem-
onstrates the rationale for NIJ’s funding pri-
orities, there is limited transparency regard-
ing how and why the agency is allocating its
funding.’’ In 2018, a GAO spokesperson testi-
fied before the Senate Judiciary Committee
that we lack the tools necessary to assess
whether the CEBR program is working:
Concerns regarding the process for identi-
fying lobbying-related conflicts of interest
were reported by the Comptroller General in
the 2019 report on the CEBR program. This
2019 report states that ‘‘OJP has not properly
designed all controls related to selected re-
quirements for conflicts of interest and lob-
bying.’’ Because DOJ’s Office of Inspector
General also identified conflicts of interest
with NIJ grant programs as early as 2009, it
is imperative that the Office of Justice Pro-
grams immediately establish all appropriate
controls necessary to eliminate such con-
flicts, as recommended by the Government
Accountability Office in the report entitled,
‘DNA Evidence: DOJ Should Improve Per-
formance Measurement and Properly Design
controls for Nationwide Grant Program’
(GAO–19–216).
We also request that you give your com-
mitment, prior to the end of this calendar
year, to implement three steps, based on the
2019 and 2013 recommendations of the Comp-
troller General. Specifically, we ask that you
commit that OJP will:
Define CEBR program-wide goals in clear,
specific, and measurable terms by no later
than June 30, 2019.
Consistently document these measurable
goals for the CEBR program and use per-
formance measures that fully reflect the rec-
ommendations made by GAO in its report en-
titled, ‘DNA Evidence: DOJ Should Improve
Performance Measurement and Properly De-
sign controls for Nationwide Grant Program’
(GAO–19–216).
Describe any actions taken, including
steps to eliminate conflicts of interest to im-
prove the CEBR program based on the 2019
recommendations of the Comptroller Gen-
eral.
We look forward to hearing your response
no later than December 20, 2019. If you have
any questions, please contact Evelyn Fortier
of Senator Grassley’s staff or Franci Rooney
of Senator Cornyn’s staff. Thank you in ad-
vance for your cooperation.
Sincerely,
CHARLES E. GRASSLEY,
Chairman.

RECOGNIZING THE JESSE WHITE
TUMBLERS
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, every
year, 250 Chicago kids form 8 teams to
perform 1,500 shows of acrobatic won-
der at major sporting events, commu-
nity businesses, and charities. They are
called the Jesse White Tumblers, and
for 60 years the troupe has delighted
audiences in Illinois and across the
world, including Hong Kong, Israel, and
Croatia. Since 1959, more than 18,000
youths have put in the hard work and
performed in the Jesse White Tum-
blers. Today, we congratulate this
well-loved Chicago institution on its
60th anniversary.
Jesse White, the man whom the
troupe is named after, is the 37th sec-
retary of State for Illinois. He is the
first African American to win state-
wide office in Illinois, and he has held
the office longer than anyone else. I am
honored to count him as a friend.
Just like the Tumblers, Jesse was an
outstanding athlete and student grow-
ing up. He attended Waller High School
in Chicago, earning All-City honors in
basketball and baseball. He hoped to
play professional baseball after grad-
uating, but his father insisted on him
going to college first. He went to Ala-
bama State College, majoring in phys-
ical education. He was All-Conference
in baseball and basketball. When he
graduated, Jesse signed with the Chi-
cago Cubs. Four days before leaving for
spring training, the U.S. Army drafted
him, assigning him to the 101st Air-
borne Division. In 1959, Jesse returned
to Chicago and played third base in the
Cubs minor league system.
During the off-season, Jesse taught
physical education at his alma mater,
Schiller Elementary School, and in the
Chicago Park District. In December
1959, the Chicago Park District asked
Jesse to create a gym show for the
Rockwell Garden Fieldhouse. The show
he developed became the foundation for
the Jesse White Tumblers.
Jesse White has served the people of
Illinois throughout his career, along
with being secretary of State for Illi-
nois. He was the recorder of deeds of
Cook County from 1992 to 1999, a legis-
lator in the Illinois General Assembly
for 16 years, and a public school teach-
er for 33 years. But his favorite role
may still be coach of the Jesse White
Tumblers.
Children between the ages of 6 and 20
can find a second family in the Jesse
White Tumblers. Becoming a Tumbler
is not an easy task. Thousands of
young people apply every year, and few
make it. In addition to athletic
achievement, members must stay in
school, maintain a C average, and stay
away from drugs and alcohol. For the
hard work, members get the thrill of
performing and develop confidence,
structure, and discipline. The program
also helps with homework, study skills,
and can provide financial support
through scholarships. The Jesse White
Tumblers have changed the lives of
generations of young people.
The Jesse White Tumblers have
earned their reputation as a legend in
the State of Illinois. Here is to many
more years of success.

RECOGNIZING AGRI-MARK CABOT
CREAMERY CO-OPERATIVE
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this year
marks the 100th anniversary of one of
Vermont’s most nationally recognized
businesses, Agri-Mark Cabot Creamery
Co-operative. Founded as a small but-
ter plant in Cabot, VT, with principles
of producing high-quality dairy prod-
ucts and supporting farmers and com-
munities, Cabot has grown to be a lead-
er in the dairy industry, raising the bar
for excellence across the country. The
founders of Cabot prided themselves on
quality products and doing things the
right way. Cabot began with just 94
members that collectively owned 800
cows. Today, Cabot has expanded to in-
clude over 800 farm families, never los-
ing sight of their core values of excep-
tional quality, safety, and community
cooperation. These tenants have been
upheld by their members repeatedly
throughout the last century.
The farm families of Cabot Creamery
Co-operative continue to be innovators,
pioneers of sustainability, and dedi-
cated stewards to their land and ani-
mals. Their products consistently
prove to be the cream of the crop, win-
ning many awards, and rightfully earn-
ing the title of ‘‘World’s Best Ched-
dar.’’ For decades, they have been earn-
ing top marks around the country and
world, from respected competitions
like the U.S. Championship Cheese
Contest, the American Cheese Society,
and even the World Championship
Cheese Contest. The recognition is well
deserved after a century of hard work,
dedication, and commitment shown by
generations of farmers across New Eng-
land and New York.

December 18, 2019
Not only do they produce excellent
products, Cabot’s farm families are
leaders of sustainability. They have
worked to strengthen green farming
practices, some of which provide
Vermont families with electricity, and
even their own electricity processing
plant. They have made continuous ef-
forts to create more sustainable prac-
tices, from conserving water to install-
ing solar panels. Cabot and their mem-
bers have been awarded prestigious
honors, such as U.S. Dairy Sustain-
ability Awards and New England Green
Pastures Award for Outstanding Dairy
Farm of the Year. Cabot has recently
been classified as a B Corporation, the
first dairy cooperative to achieve that
certification, which shows the strong
commitment they have to being a so-
cially and environmentally responsible
business.
I have had the pleasure to work with
Cabot, creating lasting memories and
an incredible working relationship that
has supported the dairy industry in
Vermont and the entire country. I am
privileged to host Cabot at my annual
Taste of Vermont event, and guests of
the reception are often greeted by the
distinct Cabot plaid upon entering the
Kennedy Caucus Room on Capitol Hill.
As a Vermonter, I am proud of the in-
credible service Cabot, its leaders, and
their farmers provide for our State, our
economy, and the larger dairy indus-
try. Cabot truly represents the essence,
values, and traditions of what makes
Vermont special. I congratulate Cabot
and their dairy farmers on 100 years of
hard work and success.
f
RECOGNIZING 14TH STAR
BREWERY
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to
celebrate the success of a Vermont en-
trepreneur and small business owner,
Steve Gagner, of 14th Star Brewery.
Started in 2012, 14th Star Brewery
began in a hand-built brew house in St.
Albans, VT, with beer brewed in
repurposed maple sap collection tanks.
Under the leadership of the team he
has assembled, the company has grown
immensely since then, increasing their
staff to 24 and moving to a new loca-
tion where they are expected to
produce over 8,000 barrels of craft beer
by year-end. 14th Star has become
widely popular throughout Vermont
and distributes to six nearby States.
The creation of this Vermont brew-
ery, however, began on the battlefields
of Afghanistan. The founders of 14th
Star, Steve Gagner and Matt Kehaya,
served in Afghanistan with the
Vermont Army National Guard. During
their deployment, they drafted the
business plan for their dream company
on the back of a notebook. Even as the
business has grown dramatically, Steve
continues to serve in the Vermont
Army National Guard and has been
named commanding officer of the
Army Mountain Warfare School in
Jericho, VT. Steve was deployed for
two combat tours and is a two-time
Bronze Star recipient. He also teaches
the next generation of leaders as an as-
sistant professor at Norwich Univer-
sity.
Named after Vermont’s status as the
14th State to join the Union, Steve has
ensured that 14th Star Brewery main-
tains a close tie to service of our fellow
Vermonters. Taking its values from
Steve and his close-knit leadership
team, the brewery directs a portion of
its proceeds towards supporting Purple
Hearts Reunited, an organization
founded by fellow Vermont Guardsman
Zach Fike to return lost or stolen mili-
tary medals to veterans and their fami-
lies. Each June, which is PTSD aware-
ness month, 14th Star releases a special
brew, 11Bravo, and hosts an annual
event to support the Josh Pallotta fund
for addressing veteran suicides, in
memory of his fellow Vermont Guards-
man.
Steve and 14th Star are proud and de-
voted members of the St. Albans and
Franklin County community, serving
every way possible, such as raising
enough funds to ensure eggs and milk
were supplied to a local kitchen for an
entire year. 14th Star’s tireless efforts
to give back to their community and
the State shows how far a small
business’s impact can go.
Marcelle and I have enjoyed getting
to know Steve and his wife Nicole over
the years. During the Vermont Brewers
Festival in 2015, Steve kindly gave me
a tour of the festival and introduced
me to many amazing brewers within
our State. Marcelle and I have also had
the pleasure of visiting 14th Star Brew-
ery, where we were impressed not only
by the creativity and quality of the
beer but also the sense of community
they have fostered by creating a wel-
coming gathering space in St. Albans.
His sister and business partner, Andrea
Gagner, who is the CEO of 14th Star,
has also joined us in DC to participate
in the annual Taste of Vermont on
Capitol Hill for 2 years, and Marcelle
and I have enjoyed spending time with
her at the event.
I was proud to hear that Steve was
chosen as the Vermont Small Business
Person of the Year earlier this year. I
have seen firsthand the dedication
Steve has not only to his community
in St. Albans but also to the veteran’s
community. He has an outstanding
work ethic and I applaud him for all
the selfless work to give back to his
community. I believe Steve truly ex-
emplifies what it means to be a small
business owner in Vermont and he is
very deserving of this high recognition.

HAZELETT CONTINUOUS CASTING
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would
like to take a moment to recognize the
success of another Vermont business,
Hazelett Continuous Casting, which is
celebrating its 100th anniversary of
producing quality casting equipment
and research. Hazelett is a true pioneer
of continuous metal casting develop-
ment and research, growing from one
man’s dream into one of Vermont’s
most successful companies. As a
fourth-generation, family-run com-
pany, it is fitting to look back on
Hazelett’s 100 years of public service
and learn more about their history.
Hazelett’s founder, Clarence W.
Hazelett, worked tirelessly to design
and develop continuous metal casting
technology in 1919. Clarence’s commit-
ment was undying, his persistence to
be a leader in this field led to his
groundbreaking work being recognized
through worldwide patents and tech-
nical publications. In 1924, Clarence es-
tablished the first commercial contin-
uous metals casting and processing
company in the world, Hazelett Stor-
age Battery Company. Upon his death,
his two sons, William ‘‘Bill’’ and Rich-
ard, followed in his footsteps and took
Hazelett a step further.
Bill took the reins from his father,
becoming president of the company in
1956. Building on his father’s founda-
tion, Bill relocated the company to
Colchester, VT, and renamed it
Hazelett Strip-Casting Corporation. It
was here that the family business grew
into one of the world’s leading contin-
uous casting machine manufacturers.
Bill went on to win the United States
Small Business Administration Na-
tional Exporter of the Year award in
2001 for his exemplary innovation and
vision in building a very successful
business in Vermont, boasting an em-
ployment of 145 people while account-
ing 70 percent of its $23 million in sales
to foreign business. Bill passed away in
2010, but his legacy lives on and con-
tinues in his son, David.
Today, with David at the helm,
Hazelett has maintained their status as
one of the world’s leaders in contin-
uous metal casting, expanding well be-
yond the Green Mountains. Hazelett’s
prominent presence around the globe is
marked by the operation of their ma-
chines in 27 countries and the estab-
lishment of the only full-service
Hazelett branch outside of the United
States, Hazelett Trading in Shanghai,
China. David’s mission is clear: He
hopes to offer the most cost-effective,
environmentally friendly metals cast-
ing technology in the world. It pleases
me to hear important Vermont values
incorporated into Hazelett’s work.
Hazelett has been an important con-
tributor to not only the Vermont econ-
omy but the global economy. The
Hazelett family and their employees
have also helped build and support
their home town of Colchester over
this entire 100 years. A business of this
magnitude in Vermont is a true gem
and the years of dedication and hard
work are exemplified through
Hazelett’s generations of leaders. I am
incredibly proud of the continued dedi-
cation of each generation that has
taken over the business. Congratula-
tions to Hazelett Continuous Casting
on 100 years of business, may your suc-
cess continue for another 100 years.

RECOGNIZING THE AMERICAN
LEGION AUXILIARY
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise
today to recognize the 100th anniver-
sary of the American Legion Auxiliary.
I appreciate the opportunity to speak
about this esteemed organization and
recognize their efforts supporting
American servicemembers, veterans,
and their families. The centennial cele-
bration is a historic occasion for the
State of Michigan, as well as the entire
Nation.
The American Legion Auxiliary was
founded in 1919 to support the efforts of
the men in the American Legion. The
women of the Auxiliary saw an oppor-
tunity to embark on a mission of their
own, to not only support active
servicemembers and veterans of World
War I but also their communities and
families. This mission resonated
among others and by November 1920,
there were 1,342 Auxiliary units found-
ed across 43 States.
During World War II, the Auxiliary
jumped into action again to serve
brave servicemembers joining the
fight. They established scholarships for
students to train as nurses and fulfill
needs on the frontlines, donated six
mobile blood units to the Red Cross,
and established an Emergency Vol-
untary Committee to support the war
effort. At the beginning of World War I,
there were approximately 500,000 en-
rolled members. After World War II,
membership rose rapidly and peaked in
1955 with 1,001,545 members. Today, the
American Legion Auxiliary consists of
approximately 800,000 members who
continue to support troops and vet-
erans across the world in war and
peacetime.
Communities throughout the State
of Michigan, as well as across the coun-
try, benefit from the Auxiliary’s advo-
cacy and outreach. This past year,
their work has culminated into over 40
million volunteer hours and $37 million
to charitable efforts across the United
States. Their own charitable causes in-
clude Girls Nation and State, the Aux-
iliary Emergency Fund, and American
Legion Child Welfare Foundation, as
well as numerous scholarships and
helping to fund veteran support serv-
ices.
In addition to philanthropic work,
the Auxiliary has advocated for vet-
erans’ rights and increased support for
those who have served our Nation.
They have advocated for legislation
such as the GI bill, legislation that
would expand U.S. Department of Vet-
erans Affairs benefits, and efforts to
help end homelessness among veterans.
It is my great pleasure to congratu-
late the American Legion Auxiliary on
its centennial milestone and recognize
the meaningful impact they continue
to have in the State of Michigan and
across our Nation. I ask my colleagues
to join me in congratulating its mem-
bers and their dedication to support
servicemembers, veterans, and their
families by promoting fellowship, pa-
triotism, peace, and security through-
out the world.
TRIBUTE TO CHIEF MASTER
SERGEANT MARCUS T. OATS
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President,
today I wish to recognize and honor
CMSgt Marcus Oats for his recent pro-
motion to Chief Master Sergeant in the
U.S. Air Force and upon the comple-
tion of his Air Force fellowship with
my office.
Selection for chief master sergeant is
extremely competitive, as only 1 per-
cent of the Air Force’s entire enlisted
population may hold the pay grade of
E–9 at any time. Chief Oats clearly
epitomizes the finest qualities of a
military leader, as evidenced by his
distinguished career and elevation to
the highest enlisted level of leadership
within the Air Force. Chief Master Ser-
geant Oats entered the U.S. Air Force
on September 4, 1996, as a services spe-
cialist and was later selected for re-
training into the field of acquisition.
Chief Oats’ honorable service has
spanned numerous overseas and state-
side assignments including Southwest
Asia, four States, and the Nation’s
Capital. He has also completed several
deployments in support of Operations
Allied Force, Enduring Freedom, and
Inherent Resolve. Chief Oats currently
serves as the senior enlisted advisor in
the Office of the Secretary of the Air
Force’s Legislative Liaison Direc-
torate. Chief Master Sergeant Oats has
chosen to repeatedly lead his airmen
by example.
Despite years of challenging work
schedules and countless military obli-
gations, Chief Oats elected to make his
education a priority. Since 2011, he has
earned two associate’s degrees, a bach-
elor’s degree, a master’s degree, and a
graduate-level certificate.
Furthermore, Chief Oats’ out-
standing performance has garnered nu-
merous accolades, including the 386th
Expeditionary Wing Lance P. Sijan
Leadership Award, two time 7th Bomb
Wing Senior Noncommissioned Officer
of the Year Award, and the Air Force
Central Command Senior Noncommis-
sioned Officer of the Year Award. As a
true testament to Chief Master Ser-
geant Oats’ exceptional career, he was
selected to represent the U.S. Air
Force on Capitol Hill as its enlisted
legislative fellow in 2019. I was fortu-
nate to have Chief Oats spend the year
in my office as an integral part of
Team Murkowski and was pleased with
his professionalism, character, and de-
votion to duty.
Chief Oats joined my office in Janu-
ary of this year while serving as my de-
fense fellow on behalf of the U.S. Air
Force Legislative Fellowship Program.
As the defense fellow, Chief Oats draft-
ed legislation, prepared floor debate
materials, planned and analyzed public
policy, and served as a congressional li-
aison between Alaskans and industry
or government representatives. Chief
Oats is the first enlisted contracting
airman selected for this position and is
one of only two enlisted Active-Duty
Air Force fellows currently serving in
this capacity. Chief Oats is a Memphis
resident and an alumnus of Overton
High School. He holds a bachelor of
science in computer information sys-
tems and management, as well as a
master’s in business administration.
Chief Oats served as an integral
member of our defense team, and I re-
lied on his advice in support of Alas-
kans and all Americans. His tireless ef-
forts were critical to the passage of the
Merchant Mariners of World War II
Congressional Gold Medal. This bill is
to award a Congressional Gold Medal
to the U.S. Merchant Mariners of
World War II in recognition of their
dedicated and vital service during
World War II—service which proved in-
strumental in securing victory for the
Allied powers. Moreover, Chief Oats led
a bipartisan effort to introduce the
sixth Defense Department Regional Se-
curities Study Center, named after the
late Alaska Senator Ted Stevens. The
centers aim to support defense strategy
objectives and policy priorities through
a unique academic forum and to foster
strong international networks of secu-
rity leaders. He also helped secure sev-
eral wins for Alaska in the Defense ap-
propriations bill.
Chief Oats continued the extraor-
dinary lineage of military fellows I
have had the honor of working in my
office, serving as a member of my
team. He was also the first enlisted
contracting fellow in Congress. It has
been a great privilege to work with and
get to know Chief Oats over the past 11
months. I know that my entire team
will agree when I say Chief Oats will
always be part of the Murkowski fam-
ily.
As I thank Chief Oats for his service,
I also thank his wonderful family who
has remained by his side for his 23-year
Air Force career. Chief Oats is married
to Cecilia Oats. They have three chil-
dren, Kayla, Mya, and Myles.
On behalf of the U.S. Congress and a
thankful Nation, I want to express our
gratitude to CMSgt Marcus T. Oats for
his dedicated service to the U.S. Senate
and to all Alaskans. We applaud Chief
Oats on his recent promotion to chief
master sergeant, the highest general
enlisted rank of the Air Force, and
hope the best for him in his next role of
Legislative Advisor to the Chief Master
Sergeant of the U.S. Air Force. Just as
I have greatly benefited from Chief
Oats’ leadership and advice, I have no
doubt that the U.S Air Force will also
reap the benefits from this true Amer-
ican. Thank you for everything
Marcus.

REMEMBERING BRIGADIER GEN-
ERAL JAMES KEMP

∑ Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise
today in remembrance of the life of
Brig. Gen. James Kemp McLaughlin,
who passed away this week after living
an impressive 101 years full of honor,

integrity, and service to his Nation,
State, and county. General McLaughlin
was the epitome of what it means to be
a member of the greatest generation.
He worked hard, served his country,
raised a family, and gave back to soci-
ety more than he could have ever re-
ceived in return.
Born in Braxton County, WV, in 1918,
Kemp, as his family and friends called
him, was raised during the Great De-
pression, and like many others of his
generation, he learned the value of a
day’s work, to be thankful for what
you have, and most importantly, how
to survive in the face of adversity.
After high school, he traveled to Mor-
gantown to attend college at West Vir-
ginia University, where his interest in
military service and aviation were first
piqued when the Army Air Corps test-
ing team visited the school’s campus. A
year later, he enlisted in the U.S.
Army at the age of 21.
A year into his enlistment, the Japa-
nese attacked the U.S. Naval Base at
Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, HI, on De-
cember 7, 1941. It was not only ‘‘a date
which will live in infamy,’’ as Presi-
dent Roosevelt so memorably declared,
but it was also Kemp’s 23rd birthday.
Soon after, he was deployed to England
as a copilot and second lieutenant in
the Mighty Eight’s 92nd Bombardment
Group, flying the B–17 bomber. The
unit’s mission was to carry out stra-
tegic bombing campaigns in France
and Germany during World War II.
During his first mission in France, his
aircraft took multiple direct hits.
McLaughlin returned fire, engaged in
air-to-air combat, and eventually took
down the enemy. This, in addition to
his 38 other combat missions during
World War II, were some of the most
pivotal air raids in our country’s mili-
tary history. The successful mission he
took part in to bomb facilities in Nor-
way is credited with halting Germany’s
efforts to produce an atomic bomb and
potentially saved millions of lives.
Upon returning to the United States
in 1945, McLaughlin was recognized
with numerous medals and awards, in-
cluding the Distinguished Flying Cross
with three clusters, the Air Corps Air
Medal with eight clusters, the French
Croix de Guerre, and a Presidential
unit citation. He then accepted a com-
mission as a lieutenant colonel before
initially retiring in 1946, a retirement
that would last 1 year, when he was
asked to serve as the first commander
of the West Virginia Air National
Guard squadron. After the unit’s serv-
ice in the Korean war, he was promoted
to full colonel and appointed as West
Virginia’s assistant adjutant general.
McLaughlin was then promoted again
in 1962 to brigadier general and contin-
ued to serve in leadership positions
with the Air Guard until his retire-
ment in 1977.
In addition to serving his Nation in
uniform, Kemp also served his commu-
nity as a Kanawha County Commis-
sioner from 1962 to 1968 and then again
from 1974 to 1976, when he was ap-
pointed to serve in the West Virginia
House of Delegates. Even after he re-
tired from both his military and public
life, Kemp continued to give back to
his community and the Air Guard. In
recognition of his contributions to the
West Virginia Air National Guard, the
Charleston base was fittingly renamed
McLaughlin Air National Guard Base
during a ceremony I was honored to at-
tend in January 2014.
In West Virginia, we are extremely
proud of our military heroes, of which
we have many. However, very few have
had the impact on our State’s military
institutions and their reputation
across the country as Brig. Gen. James
Kemp McLaughlin. I am honored to
have known him, West Virginia is for-
tunate to call him one of our own, and
our Nation is forever thankful for his
honorable service. Together, we grieve
the loss of one of our greatest.∑

REMEMBERING WILLIAM A.
LOWRY
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, along
with my colleagues Senator JAMES
RISCH, Representative MIKE SIMPSON,
and Representative RUSS FULCHER, I
pay tribute to Idahoan Bill Lowry, who
was deeply respected among his peers
and beyond, having earned a wonderful
reputation with hard work and integ-
rity. His wisdom, good will, and stature
helped inspire the development of the
Owyhee Initiative, which we expect to
help secure the future of ranching fam-
ilies and the culture of Owyhee County.
The following is Bill’s obituary hon-
oring the life of this great American:
‘‘William ‘Bill’ Anson Lowry was born
June 6, 1921 to Charles and Sally Lowry join-
ing a sister, Hazel in Bend, Oregon. He was
later joined by 3 brothers (Bob, Al, and Rich-
ard) and 7 more sisters (Effa, Gladys,
Rhonda, Alta, Dorothy, Betty Jean, and
Peggy). The family lived in Prineville, Or-
egon where Bill began school. They moved a
couple times but landed back in Prineville
where Bill graduated from the 8th grade.
After his 8th grade graduation, he began
working for the Stearns Cattle Company of
Prineville. His Army discharge report listed
his civilian occupation as ‘cowpuncher’. Bill
always had a lot of respect for the Stearns
family and they became his second family. It
was there that he met the love of his life,
Vernita ‘Nita’ Hein, who was working in the
cookhouse.
In 1942 after the bombing of Pearl Harbor,
Bill was drafted into the United States
Army. However, his induction was pushed
back because of the flood of boys enlisting.
Bill always wanted to honor the boys who
quit school and rushed to enlist, describing
many of them as being too young to shave.
He related his experience and desire to honor
these young men to Idaho State Representa-
tive Christy Zito at a meeting in Pleasant
Valley. Christy then told his story to her
friend, Brian Arnold, who composed a poem
entitled Too Young to Shave. Through the
good work of the Idaho Chapter of Dream
Catchers, the poem is now engraved on a
marble plaque and displayed in the Warhawk
Museum in Nampa, Idaho, fulfilling his
dream of honoring these young men.
While on leave from his time in the Army
Corps of Engineers, he married Nita on July
31, 1945. He was discharged in November of
the same year and the young couple returned
to Bill’s job on the Stearns ranch. The cou-
ple began to save their money to realize
their dream of owning their own ranch. They
worked hard, lived simply, and saved every
penny they could even with the addition of
their sons, Tim and Mike.
Eventually they were able to lease a couple
of ranches, later purchasing a ranch in
Pleasant Valley, Idaho in 1965. One of Bill’s
greatest joys in life was working on his
ranch and with his Hereford cattle. His love
(some would say obsession) for Hereford cat-
tle came from his years of working for the
Stearns and with their reputation commer-
cial and registered Hereford cattle. His pas-
sions were family, Hereford cattle, thorough-
bred saddle horses, conservative politics,
education, and unwavering patriotism.
Bill is survived by his sons and their fami-
lies, Tim (Rosa Maria) and Mike (Gaylene);
10 siblings; 5 grandkids—Mirren Lowry,
Amaya (Jim) O’Connor, Luke Lowry, Micki
(Kevin) Golden, and Melissa (Cody) Bullock;
and 9 great-grandchildren. He is preceded in
death by his parents, Charles and Sally
Lowry; oldest sister, Hazel; and wife, Nita.
His family would like to express their deep-
est appreciation to the staff and residents of
Grace Assisted Living in Nampa and the
First Choice Hospice caregivers for their
kindness to and care of Bill. He was grateful
for all of you!’’
The poem titled ‘‘Too Young to
Shave’’ by Brian Arnold that was in-
spired by Bill and referenced in his
obituary follows:
‘‘His body was gnarled and twisted, like a
wind-blown juniper tree
He’d seen the sunrise and seen the sun set
more times than two of me.
Hobbling from his truck using two canes,
so I stopped and held the door
He said, ‘I’m here for the Town Hall
meetin’. Is that what you’re here for?’
I wondered aloud why a ninety-year-old
man even cared about civic affairs
He said, ‘Let me tell you a story.’ So I
grabbed a couple of chairs.
‘When Pearl Harbor was bombed a bunch of
us boys all went into town to join up
From the farms and ranches, and some
from in town, we had an enemy to whup.
They took down our names and gave us a
number, then said they’d give us a call
So many young fellers were signing up
that they couldn’t process them all.
Was a whole lot of youngsters standin in
line, see they was lyin about their age
All ready to die for our country, while still
too young to shave.
It took a few months before they got to us
all, ‘cause so many wanted to go
I was an infantryman in the Army, a reg-
ular G.I. Joe.
Saw many a good man die over there, it
was a special kind of hell
We were all just tryin to do our part, for
some it didn’t work out well.
Most are buried in those foreign lands,
they never did come home
They gave their all for freedom, across the
briny foam.
That war’s long over and there’s been some
since, but I can never forget
True comrades that I fought alongside, as
they placed their final bet.
So that’s why I’m here, just to make sure,
that as long as our proud flag waves
I do my damndest to honor, those men too
young to shave.’ ’’
Bill was a blessing to his family and
the community in which he lived, and
he will be long-remembered with great
affection and respect. We are all sad-
dened by Bill’s passing yet grateful for
his life and legacy.∑

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT
COLONEL ALLEN LAMB
∑ Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I rise
today to pay tribute to Lt. Col. Allen
Lamb, a retired Air Force pilot from
the great State of North Carolina, for
his many years of service to his coun-
try as a combat pilot and the impor-
tant role he played in the development
of U.S. Air Force tactics.
Lt. Col. Allen Lamb selflessly dedi-
cated 20 years of his life to serving his
country in the United States Air
Force. During his service, he saw com-
bat during both the Korean war and
Vietnam war, while piloting a variety
of aircraing from propeller-driven
heavy bombers to the most advanced
jet fighters of the era. Lieutenant Colo-
nel Lamb had an uncanny ability of
surviving the mid-air accidents that
occurred on a few of the many combat
and training missions that he partici-
pated in, and he is notable for success-
fully ejecting from four-engine, three-
engine, and two-engine airplanes at dif-
ferent points during his career. From
protecting his B–26 bomber as a tail
gunner from Soviet MIG pilots over
Korea, to being distinguished as the
first American pilot to successfully de-
stroy North Vietnamese surface to air
missile—SAM—sites in an F–100 Super
Sabre fighter jet, Lieutenant Colonel
Lamb’s Cold War service consisted of
many hazardous and diverse assign-
ments.
Although it is difficult to narrow all
of the spectacular and death-defying
accomplishments of Lieutenant Colo-
nel Lamb’s career down to one specific
achievement, his participation in the
first ‘‘Wild Weasel’’ strike against a
North Vietnamese SA–2 SAM site is
particularly notable for the significant
influence it had on future Air Force
tactics. In 1965, early in the Vietnam
War, the U.S. Air Force was losing a
considerable number of planes during
the strategic bombing campaign in
North Vietnam due to the effectiveness
of deadly Soviet-supplied SA–2 SAMs
that were strategically scattered
throughout the country. As a result,
the Air Force developed a daring solu-
tion to counter the SAM threat that
involved using agile F–100 Super Sabre
and F–4 Phantom fighter jets to detect
and suppress the missile launching
sites. The innovative Air Force mis-
sion’’ was soon given the name ‘‘Wild
Weasel’’ because the anti-SAM mission
was reminiscent of the way a hunting
ferret enters the den of its prey to kill
it.
In late 1965, Lieutenant Colonel
Lamb was given command of leading
the first Wild Weasel mission, Wild
Weasel I. On this mission, which took
place just over 50 kilometers from the
North Vietnamese capital Hanoi, Lieu-
tenant Colonel Lamb and his navigator
Jack Donovan flew extremely low on
multiple strafing runs and were suc-
cessful in destroying a SA–2 SAM site
that was not previously known to
exist. Both men were awarded the Dis-
tinguished Flying Cross by the Air
Force for their efforts. Lieutenant
Colonel Lamb respectfully declined re-
ceiving the Silver Star award when he
was offered it because his crewman
Jack Donovan was not also included.
Wild Weasel I demonstrated that the
Wild Weasel project was an effective
method of identifying and eliminating
enemy SAM capabilities, and it was es-
sential in saving the lives of American
bomber pilots as they continued to
conduct missions over North Vietnam
until 1973. Lieutenant Colonel Lamb
completed the first, second, and third
Wild Weasel kills during the war, and
the tactics he was instrumental in de-
veloping during the Wild Weasel mis-
sions are still utilized in modern Air
Force operations to suppress enemy air
defenses.
As a U.S. Senator, a member of the
Senate Armed Services Committee,
and a North Carolinian, I am pleased to
recognize and honor Lt. Col. Allen
Lamb for his impressive career of mili-
tary service, his critical role in the de-
velopment of U.S. Air Force tactics,
and his steadfast commitment to our
country.∑

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE
REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION
OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY
WITH RESPECT TO SERIOUS
HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE AND COR-
RUPTION THAT WAS ORIGINALLY
DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE
ORDER 13818 OF DECEMBER 20,
2017—PM 40
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message
from the President of the United
States, together with an accompanying
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Banking, Housing, and
Urban Affairs:
To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90
days before the anniversary date of its
declaration, the President publishes in
the Federal Register and transmits to
the Congress a notice stating that the
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to
the Federal Register for publication the
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive
Order 13818 of December 20, 2017, is to
continue in effect beyond December 20,
2019.
The prevalence and severity of
human rights abuse and corruption
that have their source, in whole or in
substantial part, outside the United
States, continue to threaten the sta-
bility of international political and
economic systems. Human rights abuse
and corruption undermine the values
that form an essential foundation of
stable, secure, and functioning soci-
eties; have devastating impacts on in-
dividuals; weaken democratic institu-
tions; degrade the rule of law; perpet-

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mr. DURBIN:
S. 3096. A bill to amend the Public
Health Service Act to authorize the Di-
rector of the Centers for Disease Con-
trol Prevention to develop a program
to prevent the use of electronic nico-
tine delivery systems among students
in middle and high schools, to award
grants to State and local health agen-
cies to implement such program, and
for other purposes; to the Committee
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the text of the
bill be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the text of
the bill was ordered to be printed in
the RECORD, as follows:
S. 3096
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Providing
Resources to End the Vaping Epidemic Now
for Teenagers Act of 2020’’ or the ‘‘PREVENT
Act of 2020’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) High school e-cigarette use increased by
135 percent between 2017 and 2019.
(2) Middle school e-cigarette use increased
by approximately 218 percent between 2017
and 2019.
(3) Results from the National Youth To-
bacco Survey of the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention (in this section referred
to as ‘‘CDC’’) and the Food and Drug Admin-
istration (in this section referred to as
‘‘FDA’’) published in December 2019 show
that 27.5 percent of high school students and
10.5 percent of middle school students re-
ported using an e-cigarette in the previous 30
days, up from 20.8 percent and 4.9 percent, re-
spectively, in 2018.
(4) In 2019, more than one-third (34.2 per-
cent) of high school e-cigarette users re-
ported using e-cigarettes products fre-
quently, on 20 to 30 days in the past month.
(5) The CDC, the FDA, the Department of
Health and Human Services, the Surgeon
General, and various State and local health
authorities have determined the sky-
rocketing e-cigarette use amongst American
youth to be an ‘‘epidemic’’.
(6) According to the CDC, the use of nico-
tine among adolescents can be detrimental
to memory making, learning, and behavior,
and e-cigarette use has been linked to lung
conditions and mysterious illness.
(7) According to data from the FDA’s Pop-
ulation Assessment of Tobacco and Health
Study, youth e-cigarette use is associated
with more than four times the odds of trying
cigarettes and nearly three times the odds of
current cigarette use.
(8) The CDC and FDA continue to reiterate
that the use of any tobacco product, includ-
ing e-cigarettes, is unsafe for young people.

S. 3102. A bill to require the Bureau
of Economic Analysis of the Depart-
ment of Commerce to provide esti-
mates relating to the distribution of
aggregate economic growth across spe-
cific percentile groups of income; to
the Committee on Commerce, Science,
and Transportation.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the text of the
bill be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the text of
the bill was ordered to be printed in
the RECORD, as follows:
S. 3102
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Measuring
Real Income Growth Act of 2019’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) Economic inequality in the United
States has increased dramatically during the
4 decades preceding the date of enactment of
this Act, with fewer households taking home
a larger share of the national income.
(2) While growth was once distributed rel-
atively evenly across all individuals in the
United States, research shows that economic
gains are increasingly enjoyed by the most
affluent. By contrast, the majority of indi-
viduals in the United States have seen in-
come and wage growth significantly below
what is suggested by national measures of
output and income.
(3) The Bureau of Economic Analysis of the
Department of Commerce (referred to in this
section as ‘‘BEA’’) reports annual and quar-
terly estimates of gross domestic product
(referred to in this section as ‘‘GDP’’) in the
United States. These estimates are impor-
tant measures of the overall size and health
of the economy of the United States but do
not describe how economic gains are distrib-
uted across the population of the United
States.
(4) In a country of 325,000,000 individuals,
top-line GDP numbers do not capture the
full range of household economic experiences
and may be misleading. For example, the
real GDP grew more than 3 percent annually
between 2003 and 2005, but the average in-
come for 1⁄2 of all individuals in the United
States fell during that period.
(5) Disaggregating economic growth by in-
come groups will provide a more complete
picture of how families in the United States
are faring across all rungs of the economic
ladder and whether economic growth is bene-
fitting all individuals in the United States.
(6) Recent academic estimates of distribu-
tional growth show how much of the eco-
nomic gains during the 40 years preceding
the date of enactment of this Act have ac-
crued to the top of the income distribution.
Between 1980 and 2014, the average income of
the top 1 percent of the income distribution
grew 5 times as much as the average income
of the bottom 90 percent of the income dis-
tribution and more than 9 times as much as
the average income of the bottom 1⁄2.
(7) Official and timely estimates of dis-
tributional growth from BEA, reported
alongside top-line GDP numbers, would en-
able Congress to better evaluate economic

policies that impact every individual in the
United States.
(8) Efforts to address slow wage growth,
stagnant incomes, and growing economic in-
equality require broadening the focus beyond
GDP and obtaining metrics that better cor-
respond to the experiences of all families in
the United States.

Mr. HEINRICH, Mr. MANCHIN, Mrs. SHA-
HEEN, and Mr. MURPHY) submitted the
following concurrent resolution; which
was considered and agreed to:
S. CON. RES. 31
Whereas the Constitution of the United
States requires an actual enumeration of the
population every 10 years, with the 2020
count beginning in remote Alaska in Janu-
ary 2020 and elsewhere in the United States
in March 2020;
Whereas the decennial census is a responsi-
bility of the Federal Government, mandated
by section 2 of article I of the Constitution
of the United States;
Whereas any individual who wants to help
administer the 2020 Census should apply at
2020census.gov/jobs;
Whereas the goal of the decennial census is
to count every person in the United States
once, and only once, and in the right place;
Whereas the goal of the 2020 Census is to
eliminate the undercounting and over-
counting of specific population groups, prob-
lems that were apparent in previous cen-
suses;
Whereas the 2020 Census is quick, safe, and
easy to complete;
Whereas, under section 2108(b) of title 44,
United States Code—
(1) the confidentiality of all personally
identifiable information from the decennial
census is protected from public disclosure for
72 years;
(2) the Bureau of the Census is prohibited
from sharing any personally identifiable in-
formation from the decennial census with
any other government agency, including law
enforcement and courts of law, or any pri-
vate entity, for any purpose; and
(3) the information collected through the
decennial census is used for statistical pur-
poses only;
Whereas the decennial census is a corner-
stone of the representative democracy of the
United States, as the data collected through
the decennial census—
(1) is the basis for apportioning among the
States seats in the House of Representatives;
and
(2) is provided to the States for drawing
congressional and legislative district lines;
Whereas complete and accurate census
data will help ensure that resources for edu-
cation, health care, rural development,
workforce training, housing, transportation,
and other matters are allocated fairly and
accurately;
Whereas businesses use census data to
guide investment in job-creating initiatives,
such as the building of new production facili-
ties, and in choosing where to locate new re-
tail and service outlets;
Whereas, in 2020, responding to the census
will be easier than ever, as the census form
will be available online for the first time and
households may choose to respond online,
over the phone, or through the mail; and
Whereas a complete and accurate census
requires the fullest possible participation
from all residents of the United States: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That it is the sense
of Congress that—
(1) it is the civic duty of the people of the
United States to help ensure that the 2020
Census is as accurate as possible;
(2) the Federal Government, State and
local governments, civil society, businesses,
religious institutions, libraries, and other
national and local organizations should work
together as partners to inform the public
that the 2020 Census is safe, easy, and impor-
tant;
(3) individuals who want to help administer
the 2020 Census should apply for a job at
2020census.gov/jobs; and
(4) residents of the United States should
plan to respond to the 2020 Census to ensure
that all people living in a household in the
United States, including young children, are
included.

HONORING JUDGE MARY HARPER
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 18, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with
great respect and admiration that I take this
time to honor Judge Mary Harper and to wish
her well upon her retirement. For her lifetime
of service and her dedication to the residents
of Porter County, Indiana, Judge Harper is to
be highly commended. After more than thirty-
five years of service, Judge Harper will be re-
tiring this month from her position as Porter
County Circuit Court Judge. To commemorate
this special occasion and to pay tribute to her
exemplary career, a celebratory event took
place on Tuesday, December 17, 2019, at the
Porter County Expo Center in Valparaiso, Indi-
ana.
Judge Mary Harper grew up in South Bend,
Indiana, before pursuing her collegiate studies
at Colorado State University and later earning
her Juris Doctorate from Valparaiso University.
In 1984, she was elected judge of Porter
County Court No. 2, before the state legisla-
ture converted her court to Superior Court No.
3 in 1986. In 1996, Judge Harper was elected
to the Porter Circuit Court. In this position,
Judge Harper presides over the Porter County
Juvenile Court. She has been instrumental in
implementing successful youth justice initia-
tives, including Juvenile Drug Court, Family
Court, and the Juvenile Truancy Diversion
Program, as well as a mental health initiative
for juveniles. Each of these innovative and life-
changing programs has proven to be of tre-
mendous benefit to the youth and families of
the community. I would be remiss if I did not
point out that Judge Harper holds the distinc-
tion of being the first female Porter County
deputy prosecutor and judge, and currently,
she is the longest-serving female state court
judge in Indiana.
In addition to her outstanding career, Judge
Harper has served on many committees and
organizational boards including the Board of
Trustees of the Indiana Criminal Justice Insti-
tute, Board of Directors for the Indiana Council
of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, State of
Indiana Child Protection Task Force, and she
served as Chair of the Indiana Juvenile Jus-
tice Improvement Committee, among many
others. For her numerous contributions to the
community of Northwest Indiana and beyond,
Judge Harper has received numerous awards
and accolades throughout her career, and she
is truly worthy of the highest praise.
Mary Harper’s dedication to the community
of Northwest Indiana and her career is ex-
ceeded only by her devotion to her beloved
husband, David, and her amazing son, James.
I’m sure she will be enjoying quality time with
her family in the years to come.
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my
other distinguished colleagues join me in hon-
oring Judge Mary Harper for her outstanding
service to the people of Porter County and to
wish her well upon her retirement. Mary’s im-
pact on the region and her work with the youth
of our communities is truly admirable. For her
many contributions, Judge Harper is worthy of
our gratitude, and we have been honored to
have her presence in the judiciary for so long.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND MILI-
TARY SERVICE OF COLONEL
LARRY MCGAUGHY MIMS
HON. TRENT KELLY
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 18, 2019
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to celebrate the life and military
service of Colonel Larry McGaughy Mims, who
passed away on December 16th at the age of
80.
Colonel Mims, a lifelong resident of
Plantersville, Mississippi, answered the call to
serve our great nation with the Mississippi Na-
tional Guard in 1957. During his career, he
commanded four Company size units and a
Battalion in the Mississippi Army National
Guard, including the 106th Forward Support
Battalion, 155th Armored Brigade, 1st Calvary
Division in 1991 during Desert Storm and as
the 2nd Army Division Chief, Artillery Engi-
neering Battalion in the U.S. Army Reserves.
He retired as a Colonel in 1993 after 37 years
of service.
Colonel Mims set an example of faith for his
family to follow. He was an active member of
Plantersville United Methodist Church. Colonel
Mims was also an active member in his com-
munity with the American Legion and was a
Social Studies teacher at Tupelo High School.
Left to cherish his memory is his wife of 61
years, Laverne Mims of Plantersville, Mis-
sissippi; his two sons, Kirk Mims of Benton,
Arkansas, and Judge Kelly Mims of Tupelo,
Mississippi; as well as many grandchildren,
great-grandchildren, friends, and extended
family members.
Colonel Larry Mim’s life was one of service,
grace, love for his family, and community. He
will be greatly missed by all whom he encoun-
tered.

LETTER FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP
HON. JOE WILSON
OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 18, 2019
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam
Speaker, now and in the future the American
people need to know the truth about events
today as correctly chronicled in this letter from
President Trump to Speaker PELOSI. His truth
will prevail, despite 93 percent biased media
coverage.
THE WHITE HOUSE,
Washington, DC, December 17, 2019.
Hon. NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker of the House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER, I write to express
my strongest and most powerful protest
against the partisan impeachment crusade
being pursued by the Democrats in the House
of Representatives. This impeachment rep-
resents an unprecedented and unconstitu-
tional abuse of power by Democrat Law-
makers, unequaled in nearly two and a half
centuries of American legislative history.
The Articles of Impeachment introduced
by the House Judiciary Committee are not
recognizable under any standard of Constitu-
tional theory, interpretation, or jurispru-
dence. They include no crimes, no mis-
demeanors, and no offenses whatsoever. You
have cheapened the importance of the very
ugly word, impeachment!
By proceeding with your invalid impeach-
ment, you are violating your oaths of office,
you are breaking your allegiance to the Con-
stitution, and you are declaring open war on
American Democracy. You dare to invoke
the Founding Fathers in pursuit of this elec-
tion-nullification scheme—yet your spiteful
actions display unfettered contempt for
America’s founding and your egregious con-
duct threatens to destroy that which our
Founders pledged their very lives to build.
Even worse than offending the Founding Fa-
thers, you are offending Americans of faith
by continually saying ‘‘I pray for the Presi-
dent,’’ when you know this statement is not
true, unless it is meant in a negative sense.
It is a terrible thing you are doing, but you
will have to live with it, not I!
Your first claim, ‘‘Abuse of Power,’’ is a
completely disingenuous, meritless, and
baseless invention of your imagination. You
know that I had a totally innocent conversa-
tion with the President of Ukraine. I then
had a second conversation that has been mis-
quoted, mischaracterized, and fraudulently
misrepresented. Fortunately, there was a
transcript of the conversation taken, and
you know from the transcript (which was im-
mediately made available) that the para-
graph in question was perfect. I said to
President Zelensky: ‘‘I would like you to do
us a favor, though, because our country has
been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot
about it.’’ I said do us a favor, not me, and
our country, not a campaign. I then men-
tioned the Attorney General of the United
States. Every time I talk with a foreign lead-
er, I put America’s interests first, just as I
did with President Zelensky.
You are turning a policy disagreement be-
tween two branches of government into an
impeachable offense—it is no more legiti-
mate than the Executive Branch charging
members of Congress with crimes for the
lawful exercise of legislative power.
You know full well that Vice President
Biden used his office and $1 billion dollars of
U.S. aid money to coerce Ukraine into firing
the prosecutor who was digging into the
company paying his son millions of dollars.
You know this because Biden bragged about
it on video. Biden openly stated: ‘‘I said, ‘I’m
telling you, you’re not getting the billion
dollars’ . . . I looked at them and said: ‘I’m
leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not
fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well,
son of a bitch. He got fired.’’ Even Joe Biden

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1606 December 18, 2019
admitted just days ago in an interview with
NPR that it ‘‘looked bad.’’ Now you are try-
ing to impeach me by falsely accusing me of
doing what Joe Biden has admitted he actu-
ally did.
President Zelensky has repeatedly de-
clared that I did nothing wrong, and that
there was No Pressure. He further empha-
sized that it was a ‘‘good phone call,’’ that ‘‘I
don’t feel pressure,’’ and explicitly stressed
that ‘‘nobody pushed me.’’ The Ukrainian
Foreign Minister stated very clearly: ‘‘I have
never seen a direct link between investiga-
tions and security assistance.’’ He also said
there was ‘‘No Pressure.’’ Senator Ron John-
son of Wisconsin, a supporter of Ukraine who
met privately with President Zelensky, has
said: ‘‘At no time during this meeting . . .
was there any mention by Zelensky or any
Ukrainian that they were feeling pressure to
do anything in return for the military aid.’’
Many meetings have been held between rep-
resentatives of Ukraine and our country.
Never once did Ukraine complain about pres-
sure being applied—not once! Ambassador
Sondland testified that I told him: ‘‘No quid
pro quo. I want nothing. I want nothing. I
want President Zelensky to do the right
thing, do what he ran on.’’
The second claim, so-called ‘‘Obstruction
of Congress,’’ is preposterous and dangerous.
House Democrats are trying to impeach the
duly elected President of the United States
for asserting Constitutionally based privi-
leges that have been asserted on a bipartisan
basis by administrations of both political
parties throughout our Nation’s history.
Under that standard every American presi-
dent would have been impeached many times
over. As liberal law professor Jonathan
Turley warned when addressing Congres-
sional Democrats: ‘‘I can’t emphasize this
enough . . . if you impeach a president, if
you make a high crime and misdemeanor out
of going to the courts, it is an abuse of
power. It’s your abuse of power. You’re doing
precisely what you’re criticizing the Presi-
dent for doing.’’
Everyone, you included, knows what is
really happening. Your chosen candidate lost
the election in 2016, in an Electoral College
landslide (306–227), and you and your party
have never recovered from this defeat. You
have developed a full-fledged case of what
many in the media call Trump Derangement
Syndrome and sadly, you will never get over
it! You are unwilling and unable to accept
the verdict issued at the ballot box during
the great Election of 2016. So you have spent
three straight years attempting to overturn
the will of the American people and nullify
their votes. You view democracy as your
enemy!
Speaker Pelosi, you admitted just last
week at a public forum that your party’s im-
peachment effort has been going on for ‘‘two
and a half years,’’ long before you ever heard
about a phone call with Ukraine. Nineteen
minutes after I took the oath of office, the
Washington Post published a story head-
lined, ‘‘The Campaign to Impeach President
Trump Has Begun.’’ Less than three months
after my inauguration, Representative Max-
ine Waters stated, ‘‘I’m going to fight every
day until he’s impeached.’’ House Democrats
introduced the first impeachment resolution
against me within months of my inaugura-
tion, for what will be regarded as one of our
country’s best decisions, the firing of James
Comey (see Inspector General Reports)—who
the world now knows is one of the dirtiest
cops our Nation has ever seen. A ranting and
raving Congresswoman, Rashida Tlaib, de-
clared just hours after she was sworn into of-
fice, ‘‘We’re gonna go in there and we’re
gonna impeach the motherf****r.’’ Rep-
resentative Al Green said in May, ‘‘I’m con-
cerned that if we don’t impeach this presi-
dent, he will get re-elected.’’ Again, you and
your allies said, and did, all of these things
long before you ever heard of President
Zelensky or anything related to Ukraine. As
you know very well, this impeachment drive
has nothing to do with Ukraine, or the to-
tally appropriate conversation I had with its
new president. It only has to do with your
attempt to undo the election of 2016 and
steal the election of 2020!
Congressman Adam Schiff cheated and lied
all the way up to the present day, even going
so far as to fraudulently make up, out of
thin air, my conversation with President
Zelensky of Ukraine and read this fantasy
language to Congress as though it were said
by me. His shameless lies and deceptions,
dating all the way back to the Russia Hoax,
is one of the main reasons we are here today.
You and your party are desperate to dis-
tract from America’s extraordinary econ-
omy, incredible jobs boom, record stock mar-
ket, soaring confidence, and flourishing citi-
zens. Your party simply cannot compete
with our record: 7 million new jobs; the low-
est-ever unemployment for African Ameri-
cans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Ameri-
cans; a rebuilt military; a completely re-
formed VA with Choice and Accountability
for our great veterans; more than 170 new
federal judges and two Supreme Court Jus-
tices; historic tax and regulation cuts; the
elimination of the individual mandate; the
first decline in prescription drug prices in
half a century; the first new branch of the
United States Military since 1947, the Space
Force; strong protection of the Second
Amendment; criminal justice reform; a de-
feated ISIS caliphate and the killing of the
world’s number one terrorist leader, al-
Baghdadi; the replacement of the disastrous
NAFTA trade deal with the wonderful
USMCA (Mexico and Canada); a break-
through Phase One trade deal with China;
massive new trade deals with Japan and
South Korea; withdrawal from the terrible
Iran Nuclear Deal; cancellation of the unfair
and costly Paris Climate Accord; becoming
the world’s top energy producer; recognition
of Israel’s capital, opening the American
Embassy in Jerusalem, and recognizing
Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights; a
colossal reduction in illegal border crossings,
the ending of Catch-and-Release, and the
building of the Southern Border Wall—and
that is just the beginning, there is so much
more: You cannot defend your extreme poli-
cies—open borders, mass migration, high
crime, crippling taxes, socialized healthcare,
destruction of American energy, late-term
taxpayer-funded abortion, elimination of the
Second Amendment, radical far-left theories
of law and justice, and constant partisan ob-
struction of both common sense and common
good.
There is nothing I would rather do than
stop referring to your party as the Do-Noth-
ing Democrats. Unfortunately, I don’t know
that you will ever give me a chance to do so.
After three years of unfair and unwar-
ranted investigations, 45 million dollars
spent, 18 angry Democrat prosecutors, the
entire force of the FBI, headed by leadership
now proven to be totally incompetent and
corrupt, you have found NOTHING! Few peo-
ple in high position could have endured or
passed this test. You do not know, nor do
you care, the great damage and hurt you
have inflicted upon wonderful and loving
members of my family. You conducted a fake
investigation upon the democratically elect-
ed President of the United States, and you
are doing it yet again.
There are not many people who could have
taken the punishment inflicted during this
period of time, and yet done so much for the
success of America and its citizens. But in-
stead of putting our country first, you have
decided to disgrace our country still further.
You completely failed with the Mueller re-
port because there was nothing to find, so
you decided to take the next hoax that came
along, the phone call with Ukraine—even
though it was a perfect call. And by the way,
when I speak to foreign countries, there are
many people, with permission, listening to
the call on both sides of the conversation.
You are the ones interfering in America’s
elections. You are the ones subverting Amer-
ica’s Democracy. You are the ones Obstruct-
ing Justice. You are the ones bringing pain
and suffering to our Republic for your own
selfish personal, political, and partisan gain.
Before the Impeachment Hoax, it was the
Russian Witch Hunt. Against all evidence,
and regardless of the truth, you and your
deputies claimed that my campaign colluded
with the Russians—a grave, malicious, and
slanderous lie, a falsehood like no other. You
forced our Nation through turmoil and tor-
ment over a wholly fabricated story, ille-
gally purchased from a foreign spy by Hil-
lary Clinton and the DNC in order to assault
our democracy. Yet, when the monstrous lie
was debunked and this Democrat conspiracy
dissolved into dust, you did not apologize.
You did not recant. You did not ask to be
forgiven. You showed no remorse, no capac-
ity for self-reflection. Instead, you pursued
your next libelous and vicious crusade—you
engineered an attempt to frame and defame
an innocent person. All of this was moti-
vated by personal political calculation. Your
Speakership and your party are held hostage
by your most deranged and radical rep-
resentatives of the far left. Each one of your
members lives in fear of a socialist primary
challenger—this is what is driving impeach-
ment. Look at Congressman Nadler’s chal-
lenger. Look at yourself and others. Do not
take our country down with your party.
If you truly cared about freedom and lib-
erty for our Nation, then you would be de-
voting your vast investigative resources to
exposing the full truth concerning the FBI’s
horrifying abuses of power before, during,
and after the 2016 election—including the use
of spies against my campaign, the submis-
sion of false evidence to a FISA court, and
the concealment of exculpatory evidence in
order to frame the innocent. The FBI has
great and honorable people, but the leader-
ship was inept and corrupt. I would think
that you would personally be appalled by
these revelations because in your press con-
ference the day you announced impeach-
ment, you tied the impeachment effort di-
rectly to the completely discredited Russia
Hoax, declaring twice that ‘‘all roads lead to
Putin,’’ when you know that is an abject lie.
I have been far tougher on Russia than Presi-
dent Obama ever even thought to be.
Any member of Congress who votes in sup-
port of impeachment—against every shred of
truth, fact, evidence, and legal principle—is
showing how deeply they revile the voters
and how truly they detest America’s Con-
stitutional order. Our Founders feared the
tribalization of partisan politics, and you are
bringing their worst fears to life.
Worse still, I have been deprived of basic
Constitutional Due Process from the begin-
ning of this impeachment scam right up
until the present. I have been denied the
most fundamental rights afforded by the
Constitution, including the right to present
evidence, to have my own counsel present, to
confront accusers, and to call and cross-ex-
amine witnesses, like the so-called whistle
blower who started this entire hoax with a
false report of the phone call that bears no
relationship to the actual phone call that
was made. Once I presented the transcribed
call, which surprised and shocked the
fraudsters (they never thought that such evi-
dence would be presented), the so-called

whistleblower, and the second whistleblower,
disappeared because they got caught, their
report was a fraud, and they were no longer
going to be made available to us. In other
words, once the phone call was made public,
your whole plot blew up, but that didn’t stop
you from continuing.
More due process was afforded to those ac-
cused in the Salem Witch Trials.
You and others on your committees have
long said impeachment must be bipartisan—
it is not. You said it was very divisive—it
certainly is, even far more than you ever
thought possible—and it will only get worse!
This is nothing more than an illegal, par-
tisan attempted coup that will, based on re-
cent sentiment, badly fail at the voting
booth. You are not just after me, as Presi-
dent, you are after the entire Republican
Party. But because of this colossal injustice,
our party is more united than it has ever
been-before. History will judge you harshly
as you proceed with this impeachment cha-
rade. Your legacy will be that of turning the
House of Representatives from a revered leg-
islative body into a Star Chamber of par-
tisan persecution.
Perhaps most insulting of all is your false
display of solemnity. You apparently have so
little respect for the American People that
you expect them to believe that you are ap-
proaching this impeachment somberly, re-
servedly, and reluctantly. No intelligent per-
son believes what you are saying. Since the
moment I won the election, the Democrat
Party has been possessed by Impeachment
Fever. There is no reticence. This is not a
somber affair. You are making a mockery of
impeachment and you are scarcely con-
cealing your hatred of me, of the Republican
Party, and tens of millions of patriotic
Americans. The voters are wise, and they are
seeing straight through this empty, hollow,
and dangerous game you are playing.
I have no doubt the American people will
hold you and the Democrats fully responsible
in the upcoming 2020 election. They will not
soon forgive your perversion of justice and
abuse of power,
There is far too much that needs to be
done to improve the lives of our citizens. It
is time for you and the highly partisan
Democrats in Congress to immediately cease
this impeachment fantasy and get back to
work for the American People. While I have
no expectation that you will do so, I write
this letter to you for the purpose of history
and to put my thoughts on a permanent and
indelible record.
One hundred years from now, when people
look back at this affair, I want them to un-
derstand it, and learn from it, so that it can
never happen to another President again.
Sincerely yours,
DONALD J. TRUMP,
President of the United States of America.

RECOGNIZING THE 40TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF CATHOLICS FOR HOUS-
ING
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 18, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize and congratulate Catholics for
Housing on its 40th anniversary. For the last
four decades, this organization has worked
tirelessly to empower families and individuals
by providing them with sustainable housing
opportunities.
Catholics for Housing was founded in 1979
with the recognition that safe shelter is the
foundation for stability, potential, and future
success. The dedicated directors, staff, and
donors are committed to assisting our vulner-
able neighbors in their times of need. They do
this regardless of their race, ethnicity, creed,
or religious affiliation.
The organization has a variety of different
programs in order to make the strongest im-
pact possible. This includes helping those with
limited income find affordable homes to rent
and aiding seniors so they can live independ-
ently. It provides a network of support to pro-
mote sustainable change, with the belief that
everyone has the potential to succeed if their
basic needs are met. Through faith, Catholics
for Housing has provided many with homes in
which they can build their futures.
Time and time again Catholics for housing
has been there for vulnerable groups. The im-
pact that Catholics for Housing has had on
Northern Virginia is invaluable and impossible
to measure. We are truly grateful for all that
the organization has done for our commu-
nities.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me once again in congratulating Catholics for
Housing on its 40th anniversary. I also com-
mend every member of the organization and
all those who have contributed their time, fi-
nancial support, and efforts to this mission. I
thank Catholics for Housing for the diligent
work in our community and wish it continued
success.

TRIBUTE TO LESLIE ALBRIGHT
HON. KAY GRANGER
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 18, 2019
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Leslie Albright, a member of
the professional staff of the House Appropria-
tions Committee, who plans to retire after 17
years with the Committee.
Leslie, who earned a bachelor’s degree in
journalism from the State University of New
York in Plattsburgh and a Master’s degree in
Public Affairs from Boston University, started
her Federal career in 1991 working for the
U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration. She
later went on to become a management and
budget analyst for the Department of Com-
merce.
In 2001, Leslie joined the House Com-
merce, Justice, State Appropriations Sub-
committee where she was responsible for
funding and oversight of the Department of
Justice. In the wake of the horrific terrorist at-
tacks that happened on September 11th of
that year, Leslie and Chairman Wolf worked
tirelessly to ensure that the Department of
Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion (FBI) in particular, had the resources nec-
essary to protect the nation. Leslie’s efforts
helped reform the FBI from an organization fo-
cused on criminal investigations into an intel-
ligence organization capable of addressing to-
day’s security threats.
Leslie’s work protecting our nation did not
end with the FBI. She went on to work for the
Defense Subcommittee where should focused
on national security programs.
After having her son, Marion, Leslie worked
for the Committee’s Surveys and Investiga-
tions staff where she conducted programmatic
reviews of the Departments of State and Vet-
erans Affairs and the U.S. Capitol Police.
In 2011, Leslie rejoined the Commerce, Jus-
tice, Science Subcommittee. Here she worked
to improve fisheries management, weather
forecasting, disaster response and protection
of intellectual property rights. She also worked
with the National Science Foundation to in-
crease the amount of basic research con-
ducted in the United States and worked with
the National Space and Aeronautics Adminis-
tration (NASA) on space exploration. Leslie
and Chairman Culberson worked not only to
ensure that NASA had the resources required
for a robust space exploration program but
challenged NASA to develop executable and
achievable plans. When NASA returns to the
Moon, explores Mars, and finds life on another
planet or the Jupiter moon, Europa, know that
Leslie helped lay the ground work for these
missions to be developed and appropriately
resourced.
In 2019, Leslie became the Republican
Clerk of the Defense Subcommittee. It is in
this position that I began working closely with
Leslie. In short amount of time, she became
an expert on the operations of the Defense
Department and has been a critical advisor to
myself and Ranking Member Calvert.
I am very thankful for Leslie’s hard work,
over numerous years and at great sacrifice to
her family, to support the Appropriations Com-
mittee and operations of the Federal govern-
ment. Leslie’s contributions have improved so
many Federal programs and agencies. She
has protected our nation from countless
threats, advanced science in America, and
pushed NASA to dream big and inspire the
nation.
I know Leslie is looking forward to spending
more well deserved time with her family. We
wish her well, thank her for everything she has
done for the country, and know that she will
excel at any future endeavors she pursues.

SPECIAL RECOGNITION TO TOM
LUND
HON. JAMES COMER
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 18, 2019
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay
special recognition to Tom Lund, of Marion
County, Kentucky, for his remarkable career
and outstanding contributions to the local com-
munity and beyond. This year marks his retire-
ment and I want to congratulate him for many
decades of success.
After living and working in several areas
across the country, Tom came to Marion
County in 1992 to serve as Economic Devel-
opment Director. His long-term vision for eco-
nomic growth and his pragmatic approach to
attracting industry led to a remarkable 27-year
career in the Region.
When Tom began his work in Marion Coun-
ty the area had only a few industries. Now, the
community boasts over 34 industries and is
considered the manufacturing center of Cen-
tral Kentucky. His efforts have also led to
greater ease of transportation and broader ac-
cess to water resources and local industry.
Once again, I want to congratulate Tom
Lund on his notable career and recent retire-
ment. I thank him for being an exceptional
leader and advocate for economic opportunity
in the 1st Congressional District of Kentucky.

RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVER-

HOUSING FOUNDATION
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 18, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize and congratulate the Good Shep-
herd Housing Foundation on its 30th anniver-
sary. With the core values of compassion and
altruism, Good Shepherd Housing Foundation
has positively impacted vulnerable individuals
and families in our community.
The Good Shepherd Housing Foundation’s
mission is to provide housing options for those
that struggle with mental health, those who
face financial struggles, and in some cases
both. They are able to reach these goals and
support those in need through community sup-
port and the collaboration of their staff with
local partners, generous volunteers and do-
nors. Since 1989, the organization has estab-
lished a variety of programs, each tailored to
the needs of its clientele. Through addressing
the most basic human need of safe shelter,
the Good Shepherd Housing Foundation has
been a vital asset to the community. For the
last 30 years, the organization has dem-
onstrated their devotion to helping those in
need. It is constantly evolving and creating in-
novative new ways to increase its impact.
As Prince William Country grows, Good
Shepherd Housing provides affordable renting
programs as well as transitional housing for
the homeless who are affected by serious
mental illness, the organization provides men-
tal health support through the county’s com-
munity services. Good Shepherd Housing
Foundation understands that a safe and stable
place to call home is an absolute necessity
before progress can be made in addressing
other underlying issues and restoring self-suffi-
ciency. Good Shepherd Housing Foundation
saves lives, and we are truly blessed to have
them doing this great work in Prince William
County.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me once again in congratulating the Good
Shepherd Housing Foundation on its 30th an-
niversary. I also commend the staff, board of
directors, volunteers and supporters who have
worked so diligently to make the success of
the last 30-years possible. I thank them for
their immense contributions to our community
and wish them continued success.

Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize and congratulate the Literacy Volun-
teers of America, Prince William, Inc. and the
2019 award recipients. These honorees have
dedicated themselves to promoting edu-
cational opportunities and to continuing their

LVA–PW was formed in 1991 by a local li-
brarian, joined by other librarians and teachers
to provide adult literacy services. Its mission is
to teach adults the skills of reading, writing,
and speaking English in order to help individ-
uals increase their chances of success and
expand their professional and personal oppor-
tunities. With the help of more than 220 pro-
fessionally-trained volunteer tutors, this pro-
gram helps over 700 adults each year. It is the
largest adult literacy non-profit in the county
and is tuition free. At the Rewards and Rec-
ognition Night LVA–PW honors the Tutor of
the Year, Student of the Year, and Volunteer
of the Year. It is my honor to include in the
RECORD the names of the 2019 award recipi-
ents:

five years. He also been a 1–1 tutor and tu-
tored an Adult Basic Education class to help
low-level students improve their reading and
writing skills so that they can successfully
enter the GED program. Richard has been in-
strumental in helping over 250 students during
his time in our program. His hard work and
dedication have positively impacted the lives
of over 800 family members. Since becoming
a volunteer, he has contributed over 550 tutor-
ing hours and over 220 hours on other activi-
ties including lesson-planning. His students
have told our staff how much they look for-
ward to Mr. Rick’s class—he always has a
smile and positive outlook and is encouraging
to every student he tutors.
Student of the Year—Mashood Ahmed:
Mashood is originally from Pakistan and
moved here less than two years ago to be
with his family. Mashood has been a student
in the program for just over one year. He
joined this program to better his life and fur-
ther his education. His goal is to improve his
reading and writing to earn his GED credential
and eventually attend Northern Virginia Com-
munity College. Mashood works part-time at a
local school cafeteria and Wendy’s in Dale
City, where he practices his English on the
job. Since enrolling in our program, he has
had over 150 hours of instruction, is pas-
sionate about improving his literacy skills and
is committed to excellence at all levels. His tu-
tors are proud of his work and Mashood sets
an example for his classmates.
Volunteer of the Year—The Waite Family:
Joe, Tiffany, Dora, and Maggie are examples
of exemplary citizenship and nurturing spirit in
the community. For over 10 years they have
supported Literacy Volunteers of America-

volvement has helped elevate the LVA–PW

fact, family and friends came to call her ‘‘Eve-
lyn of the Angels’’ for the love she showed for
all through her many good deeds.
One of Evelyn’s dear friends who will fondly
remember her endless warmth and kindness
is Mamie Singleton, a retired Sergeant in the
Saint Paul Police Department and founder of
Youth Initiative Mentorship Academies (YIMA).
YIMA uses aviation to bring at-risk youth and
adults together to foster authentic relationships
and build confidence.
Throughout her life, Evelyn brought people
together and served as a positive role model
for youth, so it’s no surprise that she and
Mamie became friends and partners through
YIMA. This work reached soaring heights
when, at the age of 90, Evelyn took controls
of her first YIMA flight, realizing a lifelong
dream to fly an airplane. According to Mamie,
Evelyn was incredibly proud of her contribu-
tions to the lives of young people—and was
thrilled by her exciting turn at the controls.
Madam Speaker, thank you for rising with
me to pay tribute to Evelyn ‘‘of the Angels’’
Virnig for her incredible and lasting contribu-
tions to her family and our community.

HONORING POLICE CHIEF JAMES

YEARS OF SERVICE
HON. RICHARD HUDSON
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 18, 2019
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Chief of Police James ‘‘Woody’’
Chavis, Jr. for 37 years of service to the City
of Kannapolis, located in North Carolina’s
Eighth Congressional District.
Chief Chavis is a compassionate leader and
has been a stabilizing influence in the
Kannapolis Police Department during a period
of unprecedented growth. He began his career
in 1974 with the United States Army Military
Police and retires today as the Kannapolis Po-
lice Chief.
As a small child, Chief Chavis dreamed of
giving back to his community through law en-
forcement and joined the Kannapolis Police
Department in 1983. He served in every divi-
sion during his distinguished career and
through his leadership, Kannapolis Police De-
partment become a stand-alone organization,
received national accreditation, and tripled in
size. Chief Chavis prides himself on the City’s
low crime rate and on never having to fire his
weapon.
Chief Chavis has volunteered and served on
numerous boards in pursuance of mental
health and juvenile justice reforms. While most
would be overwhelmed performing his duties
with the Kannapolis Police Department,
Chavis also worked for 17 years as NASCAR
legend Dale Earnhardt’s jackman on his pit
crew.
Chief Chavis now plans to spend more time
with his wife of 19 years, Deena; daughter,
Kaci; stepson, Shane; and beloved canine
companions, Sadie and Major. He will con-
tinue to care for our community’s elderly popu-
lation and hopes to spend more time on the
golf course. I know I speak for everyone in our
community when I say we are truly grateful for
his service and wish him a long and happy re-
tirement.

TRIBUTE TO PAULA PENEBAKER
HON. GWEN MOORE
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 18, 2019
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay
tribute to the career and ongoing legacy of
Milwaukee’s own Paula Penebaker. Ms.
Penebaker, the President & CEO of the Young
Women’s Christian Association (YWCA) of
Southeast Wisconsin, is retiring on December
31, 2019.
Paula enjoyed a successful career in the
for-profit sector in the Management Systems
Division at The Procter & Gamble Company
and later with First Wisconsin Bank in Training
& Development, departing as the Vice Presi-
dent & Diversity Manager, prior to joining
YWCA. She decided to take her talents to the
non-profit sector and joined YWCA as the
Chief Human Resources and Facilities Officer
in 1999. Five years later, she was appointed
Executive Director and later designated the
President & CEO of the agency.
As the head of this prestigious organization,
Paula was dedicated to eliminating racism and
improving the lives of all women. Under her
leadership, the YWCA strategically promoted
and advanced racial justice, economic em-
powerment, and health and safety for women
and girls of color. The programs offered in-
cluded High School Equivalency Diploma and
GED Preparation & Testing, Employment
Readiness, Personal Financial Management,
as well as resources and programs that cre-
ated lasting and meaningful change to their
clients.
Even while performing her duties as Presi-
dent & CEO of the YWCA Southeast Wis-
consin, Paula found time to serve on the
board of directors for the Rotary Club of Mil-
waukee and Milwaukee World Festival, Inc.,
and as a member of the Milwaukee Alumnae
Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta, Inc. and the
Milwaukee Chapter of The Links Incorporated.
She was also a trustee for the Public Policy
Forum and Milwaukee County Federated Li-
brary System. Furthermore, her devotion and
commitment to service has been recognized
with awards from the Milwaukee Business
Journal, Community Brainstorming Con-
ference, North Central Service Club, the Med-
ical College of Wisconsin, BizTimes, Profes-
sional Dimensions and the Greater Milwaukee
Foundation.
Paula is a pioneer who has spent her life
carrying a torch of justice to ignite and em-
power generations of women to fight back.
She changed her career trajectory because
she wanted to ensure that each day she was
using all her might to fight and eliminate injus-
tices toward women and people of color in this
country, not for personal recognition.
Madam Speaker, Paula Penebaker has
made the 4th Congressional District, Wis-
consin and the nation a better place. She is a
staunch defender and advocate for justice,
and I applaud her contributions. As she em-
barks upon a new chapter of her life, I know
that her fight and quest for justice will not end.

RECOGNIZING CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS HIGH SCHOOL
HON. DONNA E. SHALALA
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 18, 2019
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I rise in
recognition of Christopher Columbus High
School, which celebrated its first football state
championship last week.
This recent victory is the result of the hard
work and determination of student-athletes,
coaches, parents, and the entire Columbus
community. This strong character is what
helped the Columbus Explorers pull off a dra-
matic victory with a two-point conversion in the
final seconds of the championship game. This
year’s state title put Columbus’ reputation for
resilience and hardwork reputation on full dis-
play.
In the state championship game, Columbus
was faced with what may have been its big-
gest challenge all season. With little over four
minutes left, the Explorers were down 20–7. In
spite the odds being stacked against them and
the early celebrations of opposing team, Co-
lumbus came out on top once again.
The Explorers overcame obstacle after ob-
stacle. They scored 14 unanswered points,
with the final two points coming with eight sec-
onds left to take the lead and win the cham-
pionship game.
The state title is reflective of Columbus’ suc-
cess not only as a football team, but also as
an institution. For decades, Columbus has
produced illustrious alumni who have contrib-
uted to our community, our country and the
world. This success is only made possible
through the school’s fighting spirit and integ-
rity, which is exactly what the football team left
on the field for all to see.

dedicate a new, larger location. Since the cen-
ter was opened nearly 50 years ago, more
than one million active-duty military personnel,
dependents and retirees have received a
warm Minnesota welcome and hospitality from
its volunteers.
During the Vietnam War, Naval Petty Officer
Scott Purdum wrote letters to his mother sug-
gesting that dedicated space in the airport be
provided for service members to rest and help
boost their morale. He encouraged his mother
Maggie to pursue creation of such a place.
Sadly, Petty Officer Purdum was killed in a
plane crash at the Da Nang Air Base in March
1970. Channeling her grief into action, Maggie
started working with airport authorities to make
her son’s dream a reality for current and future
members of the U.S. Armed Forces. She was
granted 600 square feet in a corner of the
main floor of the airport, and on November 22,
1970, just four days before Thanksgiving, the
doors to the Servicemen’s Center were
opened for the first time. Those doors have
never closed.
The Armed Forces Service Center continues
to serve traveling members of the U.S. Armed
Forces, family members and veterans 24
hours a day, 7 days a week. With the full co-
operation of the Metropolitan Airports Commis-
sion, the new space is now located behind se-
curity and is double the size of the old center
to allow for more bunks, a laundry room, a
place to store baggage, and even a children’s
playroom and a place for nursing mothers.
This expansion will allow the Armed Forces
Service Center to enhance their mission of
‘‘Serving Those Who Serve’’ as they begin
their 50th year of service.
While it is supported by a small staff includ-
ing Executive Director, Debra Cain, and four
part-time employees, the non-profit center is
run and staffed by nearly 200 volunteers—
many of whom are veterans. One of the volun-
teers for the very first shift in 1970, Jeanne
Morford, continues to serve at the center
every Monday evening. Operating independ-
ently of any national organization, the center
relies solely on donations from the community.
It has been a privilege and honor to support
the center for many years as a volunteer and
as an auxiliary member of the North Saint
Paul VFW Post 1350 American Legion Post
39. I have seen firsthand the impact that cen-
ter volunteers make providing hospitality to our
servicemen and women, veterans and their
families.
The success of staff and volunteers has not
gone unnoticed. In 2012 the Saint Paul-Min-
neapolis Airport Armed Forces Service Center
was named winner of the Joining Forces Com-
munity Challenge and honored at the White
House by First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr.
Jill Biden as part of their Joining Forces Initia-
tive.
Madam Speaker, please join me in paying
tribute to our U.S. Servicemen and women
and the selfless volunteers of the Saint Paul-
Minneapolis Airport Armed Forces Service
Center as they enter a new era of providing
excellent hospitality to U.S. servicemen and
women, veterans and families.

IN RECOGNITION OF CONGREGA-
TION BETH ISRAEL ON ITS 170TH
ANNIVERSARY
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 18, 2019
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Congregation Beth Israel
on the 170th anniversary of its founding. Con-
gregation Beth Israel, a Reform synagogue lo-
cated in Honesdale, Pennsylvania. It is one of
the oldest synagogues in the United States
still housing its original congregation.
As immigrants from across Europe made
their way to the United States in the mid-19th
century, a group of German Jews settled in
the Pocono Mountains in Northeastern Penn-
sylvania, drawn by the prospect of employ-
ment with the Delaware and Hudson Canal
Company. In the fall of 1849, a small group
from that wave of settlers saw the need for a
Jewish congregation in the recently-formed
community of Honesdale. Together they
formed the first Jewish congregation in the
area—Congregation Beth Israel. Its beginning
was humble; the group met in one of the
member’s homes to worship in the Orthodox
tradition using a borrowed Torah.
The Congregation continued to grow and
flourish under its first spiritual leader, Rabbi
Kutner. In 1850, the congregation drafted a
constitution, purchased its own Torah, Shofar,
and Megillah, and started a cemetery that is
still in use. By 1854, the Congregation had its
own Hebrew school. In 1856, the Congrega-
tion dedicated its Colonial meeting-house style
building. Despite its early reputation as the
smallest synagogue in the United States, the
building went on to undergo several renova-
tions and restorations over its impressive his-
tory, including the addition of gothic style
stained glass windows, a sanctuary decorated
with a chandelier and Tiffany globe sconces,
and an annex.
Between 1880 and 1890, the Jewish popu-
lation in Honesdale declined, leaving the Con-
gregation unable to maintain a full-time local
rabbi after 1891. Congregation Beth Israel per-
sisted in the face of these challenges and
adapted to meet the changing needs of their
community. The Congregation, which began
as Orthodox, began to transform to reflect the
German Reform or Classical Reform Tradition.
The 1930s and 1940s saw an increase of
Eastern European Jews, and the Congrega-
tion began to change from Classical Reform to
a more mainstream Reform congregation.
Today, under the direction of Rabbi Elliott
Kleinman and President Liza Roos Lucy, Con-
gregation Beth Israel remains a thriving center
for Jewish life in Northeastern Pennsylvania.
The Congregation continues to support a reli-
gious school, host a variety of Jewish cultural
events for the community, and celebrate many
B’nai Mitzvah and weddings each year. They
embrace a diverse and dynamic membership
with members who can trace their lineage to
the early founders of the synagogue and many
others who have found and joined the commu-
nity in the last 15 years. As a member of the
Union of Reform Judaism, they are proud of
their ability to embrace the changing world
around them and welcome progressive values
while upholding the spirit and teachings of the
faith.
It is an honor to recognize Congregation
Beth Israel on their 170th anniversary. May
the Congregation continue to build on this im-
pressive legacy of worship and community.

Postal Service. When Smoky passed away
earlier this month at the age of 94, he was
warmly remembered by his daughter Jeanne-
Marie and many relatives and friends for his
constant kindness, humor and love of nature.
Throughout his life, Smoky demonstrated
the importance of service to his family, our
community and our nation. As a Letter Carrier
for more than 40 years, he rose as a leader
in the National Association of Letter Carriers
Branch 28 in Saint Paul, always a steadfast
advocate for his brothers and sisters who de-
liver the U.S. mail every day. In his role as
Legislative Liaison for Branch 28, I was privi-
leged to work with him to ensure that Letter
Carriers have a voice in the U.S. Capitol, and
receive fair wages and benefits for their hard
work.
In retirement, Smoky stayed active well into
this year, because he truly understood the im-
portance of unions, and that Americans de-
pend on Letter Carriers for reliable, six-day,
door-to-door mail delivery. His endless dedica-
tion and mentorship of rising leaders and col-
laborative skills truly made a difference. He
personified the mission of the U.S. Postal
Service to ensure that neither snow, rain, heat
nor dark of night get in the way of the delivery
of our mail.
It was my pleasure to know and work with
Smoky and call him a friend. He was a kind
and extraordinary person who will be deeply
missed.
Madam Speaker, thank you for rising with
me to pay tribute to Clarence ‘‘Smoky’’
Smekofski.

HONORING DR. C. ELAINE SMITH
FOR RECEIVING THE WOMAN IN

AWARD
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 18, 2019
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor and recognize Dr. C. Elaine M. Smith
on receiving the 2020 Outstanding Woman in
the Community Service Award for the Tide-
water Chapter of the National Coalition of 100
Black Women, Inc. This award was developed
to honor women who are making significant
contributions to their community through their
time, actions, talents, and dedication. This is
an amazing accomplishment.
This award recognizes Dr. Smith’s lifetime
of service and commitment to the promotion of
respect among people of diverse back-
grounds. Dr. Smith generously serves the
community with civility and justice.
As a second grader, Dr. Smith was one of
the first to integrate the Virginia Beach City
Public Schools, then known as Princess Anne
County. At the age of 6, her parents supported
her on a journey of learning experiences that
were both negative and positive yet vital to her
development.
Dr. Smith has been an agent for change
and an advocate for students with disabilities
(SWD) as she sought Specials Education as
her vocation. She retired from Norfolk Public
Schools after more than 30 years, where she
served in numerous leadership capacities. Her
professional experiences are vast as she has
taught students with emotional disabilities, au-
tism, and learning disabilities. As a Teacher
Specialist at the district central office level for
secondary students with disabilities and as an
Educational Diagnostician, her duties were to
assess both general and special education
students who experienced academic and be-
havioral challenges in school. In these posi-
tions, she made recommendations to improve
academic and behavioral deficits and to keep
students in the least restrictive environment
based on their individualized needs.
Her service to Delta Sigma Theta Sorority,
Inc., National Alliance for Black School Edu-
cators, National Allies for Parents in Special
Education, has allowed her to put enormous
efforts in strengthening ties to the local com-
munity with her civic involvement with various
organizations. Dr. Smith’s dedication as a
leader within our community is truly inspiring.
I am proud to honor and recognize Dr. Smith’s
leadership and the role she plays in making
our community a better place. Coastal Virginia

VETERANS CEMETERY GRANTS
IMPROVEMENT ACT
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO
SABLAN
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 18, 2019
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Veterans Cemetery Grants Im-
provement Act, which helps get important op-
erations and maintenance funding to locally-
run veterans cemeteries nationwide faster by
increasing the amount of grant funds the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs can award for this
purpose each year from $5 million to $10 mil-
lion.
Our nation’s veterans and their families
have sacrificed so much to ensure that our
country remains safe and free. While we may
never fully repay these men and women for
their sacrifices, we must do more to ensure
their final resting place, whether in a national
cemetery or a locally-run veterans cemetery
like the CNMI Veterans Cemetery on Saipan,
is operated and maintained with the high
standards their families expect and deserve.
As more veterans choose to be buried closer
to home, more states, territories and tribal
governments have applied for funding from the
Department of Veterans Affairs to help cover
the increasing costs of operating and main-
taining their own veterans cemeteries. While
the list of pending applications grows, the
amount of grants the Department can award
each year by law has not.
Under current law, no more than $5 million
in operations and maintenance grants can be
awarded per year. The Veterans Cemetery
Grants Improvement Act updates the $5 mil-
lion cap to $10 million so more cemeteries can
receive the funding they need to keep up with
the rising cost of maintaining them. Increasing
the cap to $10 million is critical as the need
for operations and maintenance grant funding
grows consistent with the growth of new and
expanded cemeteries.
The Veterans Cemetery Grants Improve-
ment Act will help expedite federal support for
the over one hundred veteran cemeteries
across our country operated by states, tribal
nations and territories including my district, the
Northern Mariana Islands.
The Act has the endorsement of the Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars and American Legion.
The gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. STEIL, is
an original cosponsor of the bill.
I urge my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan legislation.

HONORING LYLE MARTIN ON HIS
RETIREMENT AS CHIEF OF PO-

HON. KEVIN McCARTHY

Wednesday, December 18, 2019
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Lyle Martin, Chief of Police for
the Bakersfield Police Department (BPD), who
is retiring after 31 years of service with the de-
partment, the last three as its Chief.
Lyle grew up in southeast Bakersfield, at-
tended South High School, and earned his
Master of Business Administration from the
University of Phoenix. Throughout his career
with the BPD, Lyle has served with distinction
and been promoted over the years, including
serving as a lieutenant in the Gang Unit, As-
sistant Chief of Police, and finally Chief of Po-
lice.
When he is not saving lives, protecting our
community, or leading our police force, Lyle
can often be found serving many of the impor-
tant causes in Bakersfield. He is a member of
the Bakersfield Downtown Rotary, a member
of both the International Association of Chiefs
of Police and the California Police Officer’s
Association, and serves as Co-Chairman of
the Mendiburu Magic Foundation Board, help-
ing provide local children and their families
with support as they battle life-threatening pe-
diatric conditions. As President of the Bakers-
field Police Activities League, Lyle has been a
key leader in helping develop concrete plans
to educate and benefit many of the at-risk
youth in some of Bakersfield’s most crime-rid-
den and poverty-stricken neighborhoods.
I want to thank Lyle for all the hard work
and long hours he has put in for the City of
Bakersfield. I also want to thank his wife,
Connie, and their five children, Karl, Warren,
Lyle Jr., William, and Lia for their patience
over the years as he protected our hometown.
I am looking forward to his continued efforts in
safeguarding the City of Bakersfield, and now
greater Kern County, as he transitions into his
new position as the Attorney Investigator for
Kern County. I am confident that in his new
position, Lyle will continue to work to make
Kern County safer and stronger, and that he
will continue to serve our community with the
highest dignity and respect as demonstrated
over his past three decades in law enforce-
ment. On behalf of a grateful community and

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF ROSA
PORTO
HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 18, 2019
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, I
rise to honor the life and legacy of Rosa
Porto, who passed away on December 13,
2019, at the age of 89. She was a devoted
wife, mother and grandmother, and lived a joy-
ous life filled with the love of family and
friends. To the people of Southern California,
she was also the beloved founder of Porto’s
Bakery.
Rosa was born in Cuba, and as a young
girl, the kitchen was her favorite place to be.
Her mother, who came from the Galicia region
of Spain, created many sweet treats, and the
kitchen was always filled with scents of cin-
namon, sugar, and vanilla.
Rosa’s life took an unexpected turn when
the Portos’ attempt to leave Cuba resulted in
her being fired from her job, and her husband,
Raul Sr., being sent to a labor camp. In 1960,
in search of a way to support her family, Rosa
turned her passion for baking into an under-
ground business by selling cakes to her
friends and neighbors out of her home’s small
kitchen. Before she knew it, she had built her
business into a thriving enterprise with a loyal
customer base.
In 1971, Rosa and her family were finally
able to emigrate to the United States, and
they arrived in California with little more than
Rosa’s exceptional baking skills, Raul Sr.’s
strong work ethic, and their dream to build a
better life in America.
Soon afterwards, Rosa began baking and
selling cakes to friends and family who had
heard about the fabulous cakes she had
baked in Cuba. In just a couple of years, Rosa
built a new base of devoted customers, and it
was common to see buyers lined up outside
her little home to pick up their orders.
By 1976, Rosa’s home could no longer ac-
commodate the increased demand, and she
opened Porto’s Bakery, a small 300-square-
foot business on Sunset Boulevard in Los
Angeles’s Echo Park neighborhood. Raul Sr.
would help when he was not working at an-
other local bakery, and after several years, he
was able to join Rosa as her business contin-
ued to grow.
Rosa’s three children, Beatriz, Raul Jr., and
Margarita, also helped at the bakery after
school and on weekends. The children were
greatly inspired by their mother’s love of pre-
paring the delicious foods she served, and
they took on larger roles in the business after
they graduated from college.
As Porto’s has grown, it has remained faith-
ful to Rosa’s motto that ‘‘quality is the number
one ingredient in everything we do.’’ From its
beginning in Echo Park, Porto’s grew to a
2,000-square-foot facility in Glendale, and then
one twice the size a few years later. In the
1990s, with the effort of the entire Porto fam-
ily, their business expanded to a 20,000-
square-foot facility, and later added a café.
While Porto’s began as a bakery that only
sold cakes and Cuban pastries, its menu has
evolved and expanded to feature a broad
array of international sweet and savory items,
including such signature items as Cheese
Rolls, Refugiados (guava and cheese stru-
dels), and the famous Potato Balls.
Today, Porto’s serves thousands of cus-
tomers and employs hundreds of team mem-
bers at five Southern California locations, in-
cluding Downey in my 40th District, as well as
in Glendale, Burbank, Buena Park, and West
Covina.
Rosa Porto will be missed by Angelenos of
all ages and from all walks of life, but we
know her gracious and gentle spirit will live on,
both in the family she loved and in the culinary
legacy she leaves behind. Madam Speaker, I
ask my colleagues to join me in sending our
deepest condolences to Rosa’s family, includ-
ing her husband Raul Sr.; their daughters
Beatriz and Margarita; their son Raul Jr.; and
their seven grandchildren.

Wednesday, December 18, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to
recognize the retirement of Mary Ann Trickey
as the Town Clerk of the Town of Hopewell

Many have said that Mary Ann is the glue

dents over the years, getting to know them,
their families and even their pets throughout
her interactions with them. She regularly at-
tends important events, both public and gov-
ernmental, in Hopewell as a pillar of the com-
munity.
In 2017, Mary Ann was chosen as ‘‘The
Town Clerk of the Year’’ for district seven,
which covers Wayne, Ontario, Seneca, Ca-
yuga, Yates and Steuben counties. She is
also a member of the Hopewell Historical So-
ciety, the Hopewell Fire Department Ladies
Auxiliary and has been an honorary Rotary
International member for many years. Mary
Ann is a member and past president of the
Ontario County Municipal Clerks Association
and the Ontario County Tax Collectors Asso-
ciation.
The Town of Hopewell will greatly miss
Mary Ann and her cheerful demeanor, her
dedication and her extraordinary kindness—
but her retirement is well deserved. I thank
Mary Ann for all of her efforts—they have
blessed a great many people in and around
Hopewell.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
recognize Mary Ann Trickey and her twenty-
six years of invaluable service to the Town of
Hopewell as Town Clerk.

ACT
SPEECH OF
HON. VIRGINIA FOXX
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, December 17, 2019
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the inclusion of
S. 2788, a taxpayer bailout of a failing multi-
employer pension plan, in the FY 2020 appro-
priations package.
There is bipartisan consensus that Con-
gress must address the current multiemployer
pension crisis, but this particular provision is a
fiscally irresponsible and shortsighted ap-
proach that sets a dangerous precedent for fu-
ture attempts to address the dire predicament
facing certain multiemployer pension plans.
Unfortunately, the United Mine Workers of
America (UMWA) 1974 Pension Plan has
failed the hardworking miners, retirees, and
their families who sacrificed pay during their
working years with the expectation that they
would receive a modest retirement income.
The UMWA Pension Plan covers 96,000
participants, the vast majority of whom, 92,500
to be specific, are retired. That leaves a mere
3,500 active participants paying into the plan.
What’s more, the pension plan is underfunded
by $6.5 billion as its liabilities far exceed as-
sets. That’s $6.5 billion that the UMWA’s Pen-
sion Plan trustees, both union and employer
officials, promised workers, but will not deliver.
Let me be clear, my opposition to S. 2788
does not diminish my belief that miners and
retirees should receive the benefits they were
promised and rightfully deserve. Instead, I op-
pose how these benefits will be paid and ad-
ministered.
Under current law, when a multiemployer
pension plan becomes insolvent, the Pension
Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) pro-
vides financial assistance to the plan to pay
benefits up to the guaranteed amount. S. 2788
circumvents that process and allows unprece-
dented federal funding for one specific plan.
S. 2788 is deceptive in its approach. The bill
funnels interest earned on the Abandoned
Mine Land Reclamation Fund (AML Fund) to
the UMWA Pension Plan. If the AML Fund
does not sufficiently cover retiree benefits,
money from the U.S. Treasury will make up
the difference.
Under current law, UMWA retiree health
plans already receive funding transfers from
interest earned on the AML Fund and Treas-
ury to pay for retiree health benefits. The com-
bined transfers are capped at $490 million an-
nually. S. 2788 makes these transfers avail-
able to the UMWA Pension Plan and raises
the cap to $750 million. In FY 2019, the
UMWA health plans received $54 million from
the AML Fund and a whopping $225 million
from Treasury.
The AML Fund is insufficient to pay the
UMWA retiree health benefits, which it is al-
ready obligated to pay. Any additional funding
will come from Treasury. To put it simply
Madam Speaker, the American people will foot
the bill for this bailout. For the first time ever,
taxpayer money will be used to prop up a fail-
ing, privately-negotiated retirement plan.
As the Republican Leader of the Education
and Labor Committee, I would be remiss if I

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1615

didn’t consider S. 2788 in the context of the
broader multiemployer pension plan system.
The UMWA Pension Plan is just the tip of
the iceberg; it is just one of dozens of ailing
multiemployer plans at risk of insolvency and
breaking their pension promises. The passage
of S. 2788 sets an ill-advised and irreversible
precedent for future multiemployer pension
plan solutions.
Multiemployer pension plans are currently
underfunded by $638 billion; PBGC’s multiem-
ployer insurance program is operating with a
$65 billion deficit and is expected to become
insolvent by the end of FY 2025.
The responsibility for these broken promises
lies exclusively with the union and employer
representatives who negotiated and managed
these plans. The UMWA Pension Plan is no
exception.
Plans and trustees promised benefits with-
out putting aside the adequate funds to meet
these promises, all to the detriment of workers
and retirees.
It should not be the role of Congress to ad-
dress funding shortfalls one pension plan at a
time. That is not responsible legislating. In-
stead, we should work together to address the
faults of the entire multiemployer pension sys-
tem.
S. 2788 sends the wrong message to other
unions and employers who have failed ade-
quately to fund their pension promises. It puts
us on a dangerous path that could ultimately
result in Congress burdening American tax-
payers with billions of dollars in future bailouts,
no questions asked.
If Congress is serious about protecting the
hard-earned retirement benefits, which are at
risk because of failing multiemployer plans, it
should address a system that is plagued with
chronic underfunding, dependency on rosy
economic assumptions and expectations, and
passively accepts that plan trustees and actu-
aries will continue to underestimate pension
promises.

House of Representatives ‘‘shall have the sole Power
of Impeachment’’ and that the President ‘‘shall be
removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Con-
viction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes
and Misdemeanors’’. In his conduct of the office of

his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office
of President of the United States and, to the best of
his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States, and in violation of his
constitutional duty to take care that the laws be
faithfully executed—Donald J. Trump has abused
the powers of the Presidency, in that: Using the
powers of his high office, President Trump solicited
the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in
the 2020 United States Presidential election. He did
so through a scheme or course of conduct that in-
cluded soliciting the Government of Ukraine to pub-
licly announce investigations that would benefit his
reelection, harm the election prospects of a political
opponent, and influence the 2020 United States
Presidential election to his advantage. President
Trump also sought to pressure the Government of
Ukraine to take these steps by conditioning official
United States Government acts of significant value
to Ukraine on its public announcement of the inves-
tigations. President Trump engaged in this scheme
or course of conduct for corrupt purposes in pursuit
of personal political benefit. In so doing, President
Trump used the powers of the Presidency in a man-
ner that compromised the national security of the
United States and undermined the integrity of the
United States democratic process. He thus ignored
and injured the interests of the Nation. President
Trump engaged in this scheme or course of conduct
through the following means: (1) President
Trump—acting both directly and through his agents
within and outside the United States Government—
corruptly solicited the Government of Ukraine to
publicly announce investigations into—(A) a polit-
ical opponent, former Vice President Joseph R.
Biden, Jr.; and (B) a discredited theory promoted by
Russia alleging that Ukraine—rather than Russia—
interfered in the 2016 United States Presidential
election. (2) With the same corrupt motives, Presi-
dent Trump—acting both directly and through his
agents within and outside the United States Govern-
ment—conditioned two official acts on the public
announcements that he had requested—(A) the re-
lease of $391 million of United States taxpayer funds
that Congress had appropriated on a bipartisan basis
for the purpose of providing vital military and secu-
rity assistance to Ukraine to oppose Russian aggres-
sion and which President Trump had ordered sus-
pended; and (B) a head of state meeting at the
White House, which the President of Ukraine
sought to demonstrate continued United States sup-
port for the Government of Ukraine in the face of
Russian aggression. (3) Faced with the public revela-
tion of his actions, President Trump ultimately re-
leased the military and security assistance to the
Government of Ukraine, but has persisted in openly

and corruptly urging and soliciting Ukraine to un-
dertake investigations for his personal political ben-
efit. These actions were consistent with President
Trump’s previous invitations of foreign interference
in United States elections. In all of this, President
Trump abused the powers of the Presidency by ig-
noring and injuring national security and other vital
national interests to obtain an improper personal po-
litical benefit. He has also betrayed the Nation by
abusing his high office to enlist a foreign power in
corrupting democratic elections. Wherefore President
Trump, by such conduct, has demonstrated that he
will remain a threat to national security and the
Constitution if allowed to remain in office, and has
acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-
governance and the rule of law. President Trump
thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from
office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any of-
fice of honor, trust, or profit under the United
States. Pages H12130–31
Article II: Obstruction of Congress. By a recorded
vote of 229 ayes to 198 noes with one answering

House of Representatives ‘‘shall have the sole Power
of Impeachment’’ and that the President ‘‘shall be
removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Con-
viction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes
and Misdemeanors’’. In his conduct of the office of

of President of the United States and, to the best of
his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States, and in violation of his
constitutional duty to take care that the laws be
faithfully executed—Donald J. Trump has directed
the unprecedented, categorical, and indiscriminate
defiance of subpoenas issued by the House of Rep-
resentatives pursuant to its ‘‘sole Power of Impeach-
ment’’. President Trump has abused the powers of
the Presidency in a manner offensive to, and subver-
sive of, the Constitution, in that: The House of Rep-
resentatives has engaged in an impeachment inquiry
focused on President Trump’s corrupt solicitation of
the Government of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020
United States Presidential election. As part of this
impeachment inquiry, the Committees undertaking
the investigation served subpoenas seeking docu-
ments and testimony deemed vital to the inquiry
from various Executive Branch agencies and offices,
and current and former officials. In response, without
lawful cause or excuse, President Trump directed Ex-
ecutive Branch agencies, offices, and officials not to
comply with those subpoenas. President Trump thus
interposed the powers of the Presidency against the
lawful subpoenas of the House of Representatives,
and assumed to himself functions and judgments
necessary to the exercise of the ‘‘sole Power of Im-
peachment’’ vested by the Constitution in the House
of Representatives. President Trump abused the
powers of his high office through the following
means: (1) Directing the White House to defy a law-
ful subpoena by withholding the production of docu-
ments sought therein by the Committees. (2) Direct-
ing other Executive Branch agencies and offices to
defy lawful subpoenas and withhold the production
of documents and records from the Committees—in
response to which the Department of State, Office of
Management and Budget, Department of Energy,
and Department of Defense refused to produce a sin-
gle document or record. (3) Directing current and
former Executive Branch officials not to cooperate
with the Committees—in response to which nine
Administration officials defied subpoenas for testi-
mony, namely John Michael ‘‘Mick’’ Mulvaney, Rob-
ert B. Blair, John A. Eisenberg, Michael Ellis, Pres-
ton Wells Griffith, Russell T. Vought, Michael
Duffey, Brian McCormack, and T. Ulrich Brechbuhl.
These actions were consistent with President
Trump’s previous efforts to undermine United States
Government investigations into foreign interference
in United States elections. Through these actions,
President Trump sought to arrogate to himself the
right to determine the propriety, scope, and nature
of an impeachment inquiry into his own conduct, as
well as the unilateral prerogative to deny any and all
information to the House of Representatives in the
exercise of its ‘‘sole Power of Impeachment’’. In the
history of the Republic, no President has ever or-
dered the complete defiance of an impeachment in-
quiry or sought to obstruct and impede so com-
prehensively the ability of the House of Representa-
tives to investigate ‘‘high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors’’. This abuse of office served to cover up
the President’s own repeated misconduct and to seize
and control the power of impeachment—and thus to
nullify a vital constitutional safeguard vested solely
in the House of Representatives. In all of this, Presi-
dent Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his
trust as President and subversive of constitutional
government, to the great prejudice of the cause of
law and justice, and to the manifest injury of the
people of the United States. Wherefore, President
Trump, by such conduct, has demonstrated that he
will remain a threat to the Constitution if allowed
to remain in office, and has acted in a manner gross-
ly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of
law. President Trump thus warrants impeachment
and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to
hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit
under the United States. Page H12131
