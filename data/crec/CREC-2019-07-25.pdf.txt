DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO
TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker:
WASHINGTON, DC.
July 25, 2019.
I hereby appoint the Honorable HENRY
CUELLAR to act as Speaker pro tempore on
this day.
NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

MORNING-HOUR DEBATE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 3, 2019, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by
the majority and minority leaders for
morning-hour debate.
The Chair will alternate recognition
between the parties. All time shall be
equally allocated between the parties,
and in no event shall debate continue
beyond 11:50 a.m. Each Member, other
than the majority and minority leaders
and the minority whip, shall be limited
to 5 minutes.

PROCEED WITH IMPEACHMENT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
and still I rise because I love my coun-
try, and I also rise because I believe
that we are currently in a constitu-
tional crisis.
The executive branch of the govern-
ment is refusing to honor subpoenas
lawfully issued by committees of the
Congress. The executive branch of the
government does not respect the judici-
ary.
We are in a constitutional crisis. We
have a duty, an obligation, and a re-
sponsibility to do something about
this.
So I rise today, Mr. Speaker, some 99
days after the Mueller report was made
public. The Mueller report has been
thoroughly vetted by the Members of
Congress to the extent that we have
talked about it and have proclaimed
that there are impeachable acts that
are clearly indicated within the
Mueller report. The Mueller report has
been discussed ad infinitum and ad
nauseam by Members of Congress.
I am not saying that everybody
knows what is in it, but I do know that
there is a notion that there is a
Mueller report and that that report has
information in it—evidence, if you
will—that is antithetical to the Presi-
dent and would, in some cir-
cumstances, be such that we would
bring Articles of Impeachment.
I would also indicate that we are now
1 day since Mr. Mueller testified before
the Congress of the United States of
America, the Judiciary Committee and
the Intelligence Committee.
Mr. Mueller has written his report.
He has testified before Congress, and
now the question really becomes: What
are we going to do? Will we seek addi-
tional testimony? I am not opposed to
it, but I do believe this: At some point,
we will start to see evidence of what
Dr. King called the paralysis of anal-
ysis. I believe that we are now seeing
the initial evidence, if we haven’t seen
it before, of the paralysis of analysis.
This paralysis is something that will
stall us to the extent that someone will
move forward and say, rather than im-
peach, let’s defeat.
I am not one of them. I believe that,
if we violate Article II, Section 4 of the
Constitution, then we ought to enforce
that law. No one is above the law in the
United States of America.
We must honor Article II, Section 4
of the Constitution, which deals with
impeachment. If we do not, history will
not be kind to us. It especially will not
be kind to those of us who are in con-
trol of this House.
We decide what comes to the floor.
We decide what the agenda is. History
will not be kind to us if we don’t take
up our duty, responsibility, and obliga-
tion pursuant to Article II, Section 4 of
the Constitution.
Mr. Speaker, we are at the crossroads
of accountability. Either we will hold
the Chief Executive accountable, or we
will be held accountable. I pray that we
will do that which the Framers of the
Constitution fully intended, and that is
to proceed with impeachment when
you have a Chief Executive who is
causing harm to society.
This is a seminal moment in time for
those of us who are in charge of this
House. Either we will act, or we will be
acted upon.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.

CALLING FOR REJECTION OF THE
BDS MOVEMENT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, the failure of some Members
of the House of Representatives to con-
demn the global Boycott, Divestment
and Sanctions, BDS, movement that
seeks to sabotage and undermine the
State of Israel is appalling to me.
Instead of empowering a movement
that seeks to isolate Israel, we should
be supporting our greatest ally in the
Middle East.
I have seen firsthand that BDS ef-
forts violate the core goals of univer-
sities, which thrive—or should thrive—
on open exchange and debate. And I re-
ject the rationale of some Members

who voted against the resolution under
the guise of free speech.
H. Res. 246, voted on this week,
echoes many resolutions that I have
broadly supported. In February, House
Republicans put forth one such meas-
ure to reject anti-Semitism in all
forms.
Astonishingly, some House Members
expressed dissent during the voice vote
on this motion. However, once a re-
corded vote was called, the motion
passed 424–0.
This week, the majority leadership
took the path of least resistance from
its far-left Members by putting on the
floor another resolution to condemn
anti-Semitism but refusing to debate
legislation with the teeth necessary to
push back against the hateful BDS
movement.
Support of Israel has long enjoyed bi-
partisan consensus, and real action
against the BDS movement must be
taken. I and 195 other Republicans
signed onto a discharge petition for
H.R. 336, the Strengthening America’s
Security in the Middle East Act, to
bring this legislation before the full
House for an up-or-down vote.
H.R. 336 imposes direct and concrete
penalties on the BDS movement by al-
lowing State and local governments to
adopt laws to divest public funds from
groups or organizations that boycott
Israel.
S. 1, the Senate companion to H.R.
336, passed with strong bipartisan sup-
port, 77–23. By passing H.R. 336, this
House would send a clear message that
the BDS movement’s anti-Semitic mes-
sages and actions will be met with firm
consequences in the United States.
It is important that we stand in op-
position to the BDS movement and
stand with our strongest ally in the
Middle East.
We must reject the BDS movement
with the full force of law and continue
to support Israel as the major strategic
partner that this body has long en-
shrined in our laws, our policy prior-
ities, and our hearts and minds.
f
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS
HURTS ECONOMIC GROWTH
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI) for 5 minutes.
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, my
home State of Oregon, like much of the
country, is facing a housing afford-
ability crisis that is hurting families
and the economy.
I recently held six listening sessions
in the district I represent. In every
community—urban, suburban, and
rural—I heard from individuals, em-
ployers, local officials, and nonprofits
that told me the lack of affordable
housing is having serious consequences
around northwest Oregon.
Over the last several years, housing
costs have gone up significantly, but
wages have not. Available housing
stock has not kept up with demand,
driving prices higher and higher. Much
of the new housing that is being built
is unaffordable for middle- and low-in-
come households.
To afford a modest one-bedroom unit
at fair market rent, someone earning
minimum wage in Yamhill County, Or-
egon, for example, would need to work
65 hours a week. In Multnomah County,
someone would need to work 81 hours a
week to pay for a modest one-bedroom
apartment—81 hours a week.
Housing is foundational. It forms the
bedrock of a family’s stability and se-
curity, and it is vital to each person’s
full participation in society.
The toll of this crisis on families and
communities is devastating, and it is
also hampering economic growth. I
heard time and again from employers
who are struggling to attract workers
in areas where housing was
unaffordable or unavailable, employees
commuting long hours because they
cannot afford to live closer to their
jobs.
In Columbia County, for example, I
heard how the lack of affordable hous-
ing for just one individual negatively
affected the whole community. The
county government recruited a highly
qualified new finance director from an-
other State, only to have that person
struggle to find a permanent place to
live. After staying in an RV for 4
months, she finally had to quit in the
middle of budget season because she
could not find a place to live.
Federal policies and resources are a
vital part of addressing this true na-
tional crisis. Unfortunately, Federal
support for cost-burdened individuals
and families is severely insufficient
and declining.
According to the Oregon Center for
Public Policy, more than one-third of
Oregon households are cost-burdened.
That is 530,000 households spending
more than 30 percent of their income
on shelter, with some spending more
than half of their income for a place to
live.
Despite that tremendous need, only
one out of every five eligible families
receives any Federal housing assist-
ance. Wait lists at public housing au-
thorities often stretch into years.
At the Federal level, we have many
tools to help address these problems:
tax incentives, voucher programs, pub-
lic housing, and grants that empower
nonprofits and communities that im-
plement local strategies. But the re-
sources Congress provides are woefully
insufficient.
We need to do much more if we hon-
estly want to make sure that every
person in our communities has the dig-
nity and stability of a roof over their
head.
Mr. Speaker, this crisis is why I sup-
port transformative legislation like
the American Housing and Economic
Mobility Act. It would invest $445 bil-
lion to create 3 million deeply afford-
able homes and cut rental costs by 10
percent.
I also strongly support the Ending
Homelessness Act to comprehensively
address chronic homelessness by pro-
viding a surge of resources that will
drastically expand access to housing
and case management that integrates
healthcare and other supportive serv-
ices. Our communities are better and
families will thrive when everyone has
a home.
Ultimately, any solution will require
a determined and coordinated effort by
all stakeholders, including community
activists, developers, lenders, nonprofit
leaders, and elected officials at every
level of government.
Congress must step up and be part of
the solution. I ask my colleagues to
join me today in committing to bold
action to address the housing afford-
ability crisis in Oregon and across the
country.
f
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL HIRE A
VETERAN DAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize
today, July 25, as National Hire A Vet-
eran Day.
In 2017, the nonprofit Hire Our Heroes
established the day to highlight the
many talented men and women who
served our country and are now seek-
ing civilian employment.
Hire Our Heroes serves as a resource
bank for veterans to seek professional
advice, discover new training opportu-
nities, and search for new job opportu-
nities.
Our Nation’s veterans are some of
the most dedicated and selfless individ-
uals who call this great Nation home.
While we may never be able to repay
them for their sacrifice fully, the very
least we can do is to help ease the tran-
sition back into civilian life.
A big part of that transition is ensur-
ing there are well-paying, family-sus-
taining jobs available for our men and
women in uniform when they return
home.
The most recent numbers from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics show vet-
eran unemployment at 3.2 percent, the
lowest rate since 2011. That is great
news, but that does not mean our work
here is done.
As a proud father of an Army infan-
tryman, I am proud to have supported
legislation throughout my time in Con-
gress that ensures our Active Duty
servicemembers and their spouses have
the tools they need to defend our coun-
try successfully. But it is critical that
we also support legislation that pre-
pares our veterans for adjusting to life
after combat.
There are more than 7 million open
jobs across the country. Our veterans
want to work, and service is in their
veins.

want to learn new skills and be proud
of the work that they do. It is impor-
tant that we do our part to ensure
these opportunities are available.
We can bolster veteran employment
opportunities with career and technical
education. Many of the men and
women seeking civilian employment
are already highly skilled, highly
trained. They are experienced, lit-
erally, under fire.
The skills that come with CTE train-
ing can help expand our veterans’ ex-
isting skill sets and prepare them for
careers in STEM disciplines, nursing,
construction, information technology,
energy, cybersecurity, and many more.
Mr. Speaker, our veterans are a huge
part of what makes this country so
great. They have chosen to risk their
lives to protect our Nation. We have
the opportunity, no, the responsibility
to provide them with the best possible
care and to empower them with the
necessary tools to make smart career
decisions when we welcome them
home.
Hire Our Heroes says the best way to
thank a veteran is to hire one. We
should all keep this in mind as we cele-
brate our Nation’s veterans today and
for many more days to come.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE
OF BARBARA KELLER
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes.
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, there are
people whose empathy and compassion
glow like a beacon, and others whose
shine like the sun.
That was Barbara Keller: A blazing
star of kindness and an inspiring local
leader who lived to serve others, cham-
pioned causes that uplifted the sick,
the poor, and fought for the rights of
the LGBTQ community.
For 3 decades, Barbara called Califor-
nia’s Coachella Valley home. Barbara
and her husband, Jerry, brought award-
winning restaurants to the Coachella
Valley. But it was Barbara’s generosity
and commitment to serving others that
made her so remarkable.
Barbara was a champion for com-
bating HIV/AIDS through her leader-
ship as the first female president of the
Desert AIDS Project. Barbara was
moved by the deaths and suffering of
many HIV-infected friends living on
the margins, facing injustice and dis-
crimination in their struggle to live.
She brought hope and healthcare to so
many individuals living with, affected
by, or at risk for HIV or AIDS.
As a doctor, I had the honor of work-
ing with Barbara on the Desert AIDS
Project in our shared advocacy for the
health of local and medically under-
served communities.
Barbara’s annual Steve Chase Awards
fundraisers were a fixture of the
Coachella Valley, as was her incredible
gala dress fashion, second only to her
beauty and class.
Barbara also lent her compassion to
defending the health of patients while
working with the AIDS Assistance
Project and the Loma Linda Children’s
Hospital.
During her years of service to our
communities, Barbara also helped grow
our desert’s art scene through organi-
zations like the Palm Springs Art Mu-
seum and the McCallum Theatre.
Barbara’s generosity in her public
life was complemented by her extraor-
dinary kindness in her private life.
My wife, Monica, and I knew Barbara
as a dear, dear, friend and a wonderful
role model to our daughters, Sky and
Sage. I was constantly personally
touched by her loving nature, her un-
wavering support and encouragement,
and her dedication to her higher pur-
pose.
Barbara most treasured her family,
and her greatest pleasure was being a
loving wife, a mother, a daughter, and
grandmother.
Barbara devotedly cared for her
aging father, Marvin Cohn, until he
passed away in March at 106 years old,
never once telling him she was under-
going intense chemotherapy for breast
cancer. Barbara’s death soon followed
the following month on April 15, 2019.
Barbara and her husband Jerry’s
marriage was a love story few can
claim and a touching example of the
power of true love.
Barbara leaves behind her devoted
husband, Jerry, her son, Brad, her
daughters, Lindsay, Lisa, and Kelly,
and her seven grandchildren, Taylor,
Rebekah, Graham, Ridley, Greta, Eva,
and Levon, and her sister, Carole.
While Barbara’s passing deeply sad-
dens me, her memory will live on in my
heart and in the hearts of the countless
individuals whose lives she touched.
In an era of ‘‘me first,’’ ego-driven,
selfish ambition, Barbara reminds us
that love, kindness, and genuine serv-
ice to others is possible. She is the em-
bodiment of good, humility, strength,
and outer and inner beauty. Her legacy
lives on in the countless lives she im-
proved and inspired. And she was a
giant, a social architect, designing a
healthier, kinder, more just commu-
nity.
Knowing Barbara, and calling her my
friend, was an incredible, unique, and
beautiful blessing in my life. And her
story must be told and recorded in our
national records, so that generations
to come can learn the vast potential of
our national spirit.
She will be missed.
f
HONORING THE SERVICE OF
GROVER DAVIS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. DUNN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to recognize an extraordinary man. He
is from Bay County, Florida, and I am
fortunate to have him as a dear friend
of mine, Mr. Grover Davis.
Grover was born into a fishing family
in December of 1941 in Parker, Florida,
and he learned the value of hard work
at a young age. He built fishing boats
with his father and his brothers, lead-
ing his family to own the first charter
fishing boats in Panama City.
When his father died, Grover dropped
out of high school and worked with his
brothers to support the family. They
made a living in the charter fishing
business, with young Grover below
deck keeping the boats running. He
still keeps the boats running 70 years
later.
He learned a lot about life at a young
age. He met his wonderful wife, Judy,
at Bay High School, and married her in
1961.
By the 1970s, the Davis family was
managing the St. Andrews Marina, and
Grover became interested in a new
business venture. In 1974, he began Ma-
rine Transportation Services, which
provided transport services for oil and
gas companies in the Gulf of Mexico.
Marine Transportation Services has
truly become a family affair, with his
wife, Judy, and his daughters, Kim and
Kerrie, joining him at the helm.
Grover treats all of his employees
like family. In fact, 50 percent of his
employees started at Marine Transpor-
tation right out of high school and still
work there to this day.
He is unfailingly supportive of all of
his employees. When they make a mis-
take, he doesn’t let them go. He is fa-
mous for sitting with them and saying:
‘‘Did you learn something from this?’’
His favorite phrase is: ‘‘There are
only two kinds of captains; those who
have run aground and those who are
about to run aground.’’
Grover truly leads by example in all
aspects of his life, and he has spent
much of his life giving back to the
community. He is a big supporter of
Camo Dreams, a nonprofit that helps
disabled children go on hunting trips,
and routinely supported events for the
Girl Scouts when his daughters were
growing up.
Grover, his wife, Judy, and his daugh-
ters, have long since cemented their
place in the firmament of stars that
are the foundation of our community
back home.
He has always preached that honor is
the most important value among peo-
ple, and no one person is better than
another. He never asks anyone to do
what he would not do himself.
Judy and Grover have two children,
Kim and Kerrie, two grandsons, and
two great grandsons. They all describe
him as an amazing friend, father, and
leader in our community.
He is the single most social man I
know. A great storyteller, he always
surrounded himself with his friends,
and if he stood still for more than a few
minutes, it was certain that he was
frying grouper or mullet for a host of
people. He loves people and they love
him.
I have to say, Grover is also widely
known as a huge and very inventive
practical joker. He has been known to
go to elaborate lengths to prank his
friends.

He is also an amazing historian, espe-
cially knowledgeable about the minu-
tiae of World War II. All of his friends,
and I count myself lucky to be among
those, revere our time that we spend
with him. He is always entertaining,
educational, and exceptional.
One of his daughters recently said to
me: ‘‘Daddy is so social and he knows
so many people that he could cause a
traffic jam in Calhoun County.’’ That
is a lot of personality.
I spoke with him on the phone last
week, after he received his diagnosis of
a rapidly progressing terminal illness.
After sharing his terminal diagnosis
with me, he lightheartedly promised
that, come what may, he would vote
for me by absentee ballot next year.
Mr. Speaker, as the curtain draws
closed on the life of my friend, I ask
that we cast our attention on a man
who lived an extraordinary life; a man
who changed my community for the
better; a man who cared for and sup-
ported many, many friends and family;
a man who is, quite literally, larger
than life.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing my friend, who made me a bet-
ter person, made my community a bet-
ter place, Mr. Grover Davis.
Grover, we are praying for you, my
friend, and for your family.

COAST GUARD REAUTHORIZATION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
New Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, this
morning, I rise in support of the 42,000
men and women of the United States
Coast Guard, the vital public safety,
humanitarian, and national defense
missions they perform, and this
House’s passage yesterday of the Coast
Guard Reauthorization Act of 2019.
Coast Guard members are the first
responders of America’s oceans, water-
ways, and coastlines, conducting varied
missions, often at a moment’s notice,
including search and rescue, securing
our Nation’s ports and waterways, and
conducting law enforcement oper-
ations.
In my district in New Hampshire, we
have been home to the Coast Guard
since its founding, and the Granite
State has relied on its work to keep us
safe and strong for generations.
Last month I had the privilege of
meeting with the crew of the Coast
Guard Cutter Tahoma at the Ports-
mouth Naval Shipyard. As I met offi-
cers and crew members and toured
their vessel, I was struck by the crit-
ical nature of their missions and the
challenges they encounter in executing
them.
Cutters like Tahoma patrol inter-
national waters and interdict drugs
coming to America’s shores. Their
work saves lives and makes our com-
munities safer. The Coast Guard has
been doing this work despite being
chronically underfunded and under-
resourced.
The Coast Guard faces cartels and
smugglers with staggering resources
and advanced technology, and studies
show that only 20 to 30 percent of the
illegal drugs coming to our shores are
interdicted.
According to the leaders of the Coast
Guard, the most significant factor in
its inability to meet drug interdiction
targets has been insufficient inventory
of vessels and aircraft to support oper-
ations.
At a time when our Nation is facing
a profound crisis of addiction, we can
and must do more to ensure that the
Coast Guard is fully funded and has the
resources it needs to keep our country
safe.
That is why yesterday’s action to
pass the Coast Guard Reauthorization
Act of 2019 in a bipartisan way was so
critical. This act supports the Coast
Guard for the next 2 years with more
than $11 billion in discretionary fund-
ing each fiscal year, allowing them to
address a backlog created by previous
cuts.
An important bill I introduced was
also included, the Fair and Equal
Treatment of Women in the Coast
Guard Act. This seeks to increase the
recruitment and retention of women in
the U.S. Coast Guard and improve gen-
der diversity in this branch of the
Armed Forces.
This comes in response to a study
commissioned by the Coast Guard that
identified barriers to attracting, re-
cruiting, and retaining women, and
recommended ways to improve gender
diversity in the service. It is one im-
portant step to assure that the Coast
Guard can continue to attract our Na-
tion’s best and brightest.
When we talk about keeping this Na-
tion safe, let’s remember the incredible
work performed by our Coast Guard
close to home and around the globe.
Let’s show the Coast Guard Members
that Congress has their backs, and let’s
continue to work collaboratively to en-
sure the Coast Guard has the proper
support and policies in place to carry
out its missions.

THE PLAGUE OF ROBOCALLS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. BABIN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
with great uncertainty. I am uncertain
that I can make it through this speech
without being interrupted by a
robocall, which has become a daily or,
rather, sometimes an hourly nuisance.
For far too long now robocalls and
spoofing have become a hindering
plague upon the phones of millions of
Americans. I hear from constituents on
a daily basis about how their lives are
habitually interrupted by phony phone
calls, and how their cell phones, once
seen as necessities, are now sources of
frustration.
In many cases, these calls are dan-
gerous and disguised, seeking to steal
valuable information by tricking the
unsuspecting. In other cases, these ag-
gravating calls disrupt important busi-
ness, intrude on leisure activities, dis-
turb family dinners and, even worse,
are not restricted by the time of day.
b 1030
These calls have been distracting, ir-
ritating, and deceiving Americans for
long enough, and that is why I have in-
troduced a bill called the Double the
Enforcement and Fines of Everyone As-
sociated with Terrible Robocalls Act,
or, in short, the DEFEAT Robocalls
Act. This bill ensures the harshest pen-
alties for the individuals who are
caught making illegal robocalls and
spoofing calls. Simply said, the bill
takes all the fines and penalties that
those making robocalls currently face
and doubles them.
It is time that we hold those who
continue scamming Americans all
across the country liable for their ac-
tions in a manner as serious as their
crime.
I am encouraged to see Congress’ re-
cent legislative actions to prevent
robocalls from being a daily hindrance,
and I call on my colleagues to continue
moving swiftly to send a bill to the
President’s desk so that we can restore
Americans’ trust when they answer
their phones.
HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS KRAFT
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to honor the life of Dr. Christopher Co-
lumbus Kraft, who served as NASA’s
first flight director and one of the
agency’s preeminent leaders.
Kraft passed away on July 22, 2019, at
the impressive age of 95 years old and
only 2 days after the 50th anniversary
of the Apollo 11 Moon landing.
It is impossible to overstate the vital
role that Kraft played in the formative
years of NASA.
After graduating from Virginia Poly-
technic Institute in 1944 with a bach-
elor’s degree in aeronautical engineer-
ing, Dr. Kraft started work at NASA’s
precursor, the National Advisory Com-
mittee for Aeronautics; and toward the
onset of the space race in 1958, Presi-
dent Eisenhower established the Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration and tasked Project Mercury
with getting America into space and
putting a man into orbit.
During this time, Kraft essentially
created the entire concept of mission
control and successfully directed all
six crewed Mercury missions, including
those that made Alan Shepard the first
American in space and John Glenn the
first American in orbit.
In Project Gemini, Kraft was pro-
moted to the head of mission oper-
ations. Now in charge of a team of
flight directors, he served ‘‘on console’’
during many historic moments, includ-
ing Ed White’s first spacewalk in Gem-
ini 4.
Achieving all of this proved to the
country and the rest of the world that
America could succeed in space, and
certainly set the stage for the Apollo
missions to the Moon.

July 25, 2019
During Apollo, Chris Kraft soon rose
to the position of deputy director of
the Manned Spacecraft Center, now
known as Johnson Space Center, which
I proudly represent, and in 1972 was
promoted to serve as the Center direc-
tor.
Before Dr. Kraft’s retirement in 1982,
he contributed to a myriad of other
projects, including Skylab and the first
space shuttle missions.
While our space program continues
to grow by leaps and bounds and our
hands and hearts reach outward for
Mars, we should remember the man on
whose shoulders we stand and the great
debt owed not only by NASA and our
Nation, but also by our entire planet,
to this incredible individual. Mr.
Speaker, I thank Dr. Kraft for his serv-
ice to our country, ‘‘flight.’’

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND
SERVICE OF JAMES HUSTON
MURPHY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. LOUDERMILK) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today in recognition of the life and
service of Mr. James Huston Murphy.
James is a 94-year-old decorated
World War II veteran as well as a na-
tive of the 11th Congressional District
in Georgia.
Jim graduated from Lanier High
School for Boys in 1942 and was an offi-
cer in the school’s ROTC program,
where he was preparing for a career as
an officer in the U.S. military. The
ROTC program is where Jim learned
valuable lessons that would serve him
down the road during the war.
In the fall of 1942, Jim enrolled at
Georgia Tech, in Atlanta, with the
hope of receiving an Army officer’s
commission through Tech’s senior
ROTC program. At that time, the
United States was 4 years into World
War II; and at the urging of Army re-
cruiters, Jim and most of his fellow
ROTC classmates enlisted in the Re-
serves because the military wanted
them to complete college and officer
training before going to Active Duty.
However, that idea was short-lived,
because in March of 1943, President
Franklin D. Roosevelt called Jim’s
ROTC class and others across the Na-
tion into immediate Active Duty. They
were needed as ground troop replace-
ments, and at that time, Jim was bare-
ly 18 years old.
In the spring of 1943, Jim reported to
Fort McPherson in Atlanta, where he
faced many challenges, but nothing
more daunting than passing the mili-
tary standard eye exam. And I know
you are thinking: How difficult is an
eye exam? Well, for Jim it was nearly
impossible because Jim was blind in
his left eye from birth.
This disability would disqualify Jim
from serving in the military, but Jim
was not going to let that stop him from
serving his country. He believed that
service was his duty, and after playing
a few hand tricks during the exam, he
passed.
In March of 1944, Jim was entered to
Camp Howze near Gainesville, Texas,
to join the 103rd Infantry Division. The
division was embroiled in intensive
combat training, and since Jim had al-
ready received some artillery training,
he was assigned to Battery C of the
928th Field Artillery Battalion, a 105-
millimeter howitzer unit.
They trained long and hard, knowing
they were headed for war. They learned
the mission of artillery to support ad-
vancing infantry ground forces in com-
bat and how to bracket your target
area by trial and error. Jim’s job was
to be the forward observer radio oper-
ator when they were in combat and a
jeep driver when the battery was mov-
ing forward.
Only a few months had passed since
Jim was assigned to the 103rd Infantry
Division before he was aboard the USS
Monticello heading for the war.
The trip across the Atlantic was any-
thing but luxurious. The military had
packed the ship like ‘‘a can of sar-
dines,’’ as Jim put it; and the 2-week
voyage was full of severe storms and
indescribable seasickness, and a fear of
being torpedoed always loomed in the
back of their minds.
After arriving in France, it would not
take long for Jim’s combat unit to see
their first action, and it occurred while
they approached the Vosges Mountains
in northeastern France. One of Jim’s
forward observer team was killed by
rifle fire in the small town of Barr,
which meant that Jim and the other
member had to carry on the job a man
short. For this, they were later award-
ed the Bronze Star.
Jim survived the record winter that
enveloped northern France, Belgium,
and Germany during the war, but he
did not leave unscathed. On Christmas
night 1944, after finishing a warm meal,
Jim became very sick while single-
handedly manning a forward outpost
only 200 yards from German soldiers.
The pain became so intense that he had
to be transported to a field hospital,
and doctors determined he had a bad
case of appendicitis.
While Jim was lying in the hospital
bed after appendix surgery, the Battle
of the Bulge was just getting under-
way, and Jim realized his battery des-
perately need him. Going against doc-
tors’ orders, Jim put on his uniform,
left the hospital, and hitched a ride
back to his battery. The rest of Jim’s
unit was amazed he came back, and in
the meantime, his battery commander
had learned he was blind in one eye.
Jim was nominated for the Silver Star,
but Jim refused, as he felt any citation
earned should go to the entire battery,
not just him.
Germany surrendered in May of 1945,
marking the end of the war effort in
Europe, but the war was still raging in
the Pacific, and that is where Jim was
sent. However, before Jim got there,
the atomic bombs were dropped on Hir-
oshima and Nagasaki, and World War II
was soon over.
In Jim’s own words: ‘‘My contribu-
tions to World War II, from enlistment
to discharge, was 2 years, 11 months,
and 14 days of my youth, including 9
months in combat. For this I am proud
and have no regrets. I did not have to
go to the war, but I believed it was my
duty, and I wanted to go.’’
Jim will be the first to tell you his
story is like so many others who
fought in Europe during World War II,
but in reading his memoirs, his self-
lessness, his duty to his country and
fellow soldiers was quite exemplary.
Mr. Speaker, Georgia’s 11th Congres-
sional District and the United States
House of Representatives thanks Jim.
We thank him for his service to our Na-
tion and his sacrifice for our freedoms.
f
WE CANNOT GIVE UP ON THE
GUATEMALAN PEOPLE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
California (Mrs. TORRES) for 5 minutes.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today as the first person
born in Guatemala to serve in the
United States House of Representa-
tives.
I know the Guatemalan people have
lived through many difficult times, and
I know this because I was born there
during the civil war. My parents made
the heartbreaking decision to send me
to live with my uncle in the United
States when I was a little girl.
But through it all, the people of Gua-
temala have not given up. They have
continued to work to make a better life
for their children and for their chil-
dren’s children. They have worked for
justice, for democracy, and they have
won important victories.
In 1996, the efforts of the Guatemalan
people ended the civil war; and in 2007,
their search for justice led to the cre-
ation of the International Commission
Against Impunity in Guatemala, an in-
novative institution whose mission was
to help rid the country of corruption
and organized crime. Working with
brave Guatemalan judges and prosecu-
tors, CICIG made real progress in im-
proving Guatemala’s justice system.
Then, in 2015, Guatemalans of all
ages and political stripes took to the
streets to call for the resignation of
massively corrupt President Otto Perez
Molina, and they won.
The long struggle of the Guatemalan
people has led to a country that is
safer and more just. The country’s
problems are far from resolved, but
progress has been made.
Today Guatemala is at a crossroads.
CICIG has, unfortunately, been forced
out, and the country is in the middle of
an election season, but many Guate-
malans fear that the current govern-
ment will be replaced by a new govern-
ment that is just as corrupt as the cur-
rent and the previous ones.
So many Guatemalans feel like they
are alone, and some are losing hope,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7386 July 25, 2019
but to the Guatemalan people I say
this:
You are not alone, and you cannot
give up. Many of us here in the United
States Congress understand your chal-
lenges. We understand what you are
facing, and many of us refuse to believe
the lies peddled by the corrupt polit-
ical class and their lobbyists. And
many of us will continue to stand with
you, and we will keep on fighting for
your cause because we know that it is
our cause, too. We know that a more
just and democratic Guatemala is only
in the best interests of ours, as well,
and we know that you want for your
children the same thing that we want
for our American children.
I am confident that one day Guate-
mala will have a government that is
worthy of its people, a government
that works to advance justice, not to
undermine and eliminate it; and one
day, the United States Government
will once again support the fight
against corruption in Guatemala, and
together, as partners, we will work to-
ward a brighter and more prosperous
and more democratic future.
So in closing I say to my colleagues,
we cannot give up on the Guatemalan
people. And to the Guatemalan people I
say:
Do not give up on your future. Even
in the darkness, we must look for signs
of hope.
And in 1990, a brave anthropologist
named Myrna Mack was killed by a
military death squad for speaking out
about the abuses against indigenous
Guatemalans, but her sister Helen
worked to bring justice in her case and
helped lead the effort to create CICIG.
And now Myrna Mack’s daughter
Lucrecia is going to be a member of the
Guatemalan Congress.
So we must remember Pablo
Neruda’s words: ‘‘They can cut all the
flowers, but they can’t stop the
spring.’’
f
A TOPIC THAT MUST BE
ADDRESSED
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5
minutes.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today as a former FBI supervisory
special agent and Federal prosecutor
and as a strong advocate for civility to
speak on a topic that must be ad-
dressed.
In our country, political discourse
has disintegrated to a degree that is
completely unacceptable. Political op-
ponents label each other as enemies,
and differences of opinion are met with
slander and, oftentimes, with violence.
I have never remained silent on this
issue. When White supremacists mur-
dered a 32-year-old protestor in Char-
lottesville, Virginia, I expressed my
outrage. When violent clashes erupted
in Berkeley, California, in 2017, I also
spoke out.
Recently, in Portland Oregon, a jour-
nalist was assaulted by Members of the
militant antifa movement. This jour-
nalist was covering an ongoing protest
and suffered a brain hemorrhage, re-
quiring overnight hospitalization.
b 1045
Mr. Speaker, violence and hatred by
any actor on any level is completely
unacceptable. What is deeply troubling
is antifa’s history of provoking and
stoking political violence, along with
encouraging civil unrest, to dissuade
those who do not share their beliefs
from exercising their First Amendment
rights.
In addition to the incident in Port-
land, antifa has tried to insight riots in
Washington, D.C., following President
Trump’s inauguration, and several
antifa members in Philadelphia, right
outside of my district, were arrested
following an assault on Marine reserv-
ists. The charges they face include ag-
gravated assault, ethnic intimidation,
and conspiracy, among others.
Antifa has no desire to protest peace-
fully, no desire to learn from other peo-
ple’s experiences, and no desire to be
receptive to fair and rational ideas out-
side of their own. They resort to vio-
lence and eschew peaceful demonstra-
tion at every turn.
I recently sent a letter to Attorney
General Bill Barr, demanding the De-
partment of Justice initiate pro-
ceedings to designate antifa as a do-
mestic terrorist organization to pro-
tect the welfare of journalists and also
the general public. I have asked my
former colleagues at the FBI to do the
same.
Political violence has no place in our
society. In my career in law enforce-
ment, I have seen firsthand how vio-
lence erodes civil society. We must not
give a pass to any organization that
perpetuates a vicious cycle of hatred
and ignorance.
Antifa must be designated as the do-
mestic terrorist organization that it is.
f
MAKE AUGUST 16 NATIONAL
INDEPENDENT WORKER DAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Michigan (Mr. MOOLENAAR) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker,
independent workers are vital to our
country and the strong economy that
we are enjoying today, with unemploy-
ment under 4 percent, wages rising, and
Americans keeping more of their own
money, thanks to tax reform.
These millions of workers are pur-
suing the American Dream of working
for themselves, including contractors,
consultants, freelancers, and small
business owners. They embody the
principles and values of our country’s
Declaration of Independence by truly
representing what it means to be free.
They are found across every profession,
income level, industry, party, race, re-
ligion, gender, and geography.
That is why I am joining with the As-
sociation of Independent Workers in
calling for August 16 to be National
Independent Worker Day.
This special recognition of inde-
pendent workers’ vital role in our Na-
tion’s economy is long overdue. As
more and more Americans choose to
take this career path, I will keep fight-
ing to make sure Washington stays out
of their way and allows them to inno-
vate and succeed.
I am proud to support all the inde-
pendent workers in my district and
throughout this great Nation.
HONORING CONSERVATIVE WRITER RUSSELL
KIRK
Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to pay tribute to the late Dr.
Russell Kirk, a political theorist, mor-
alist, historian, and literary critic, in
honor of a historical marker being
placed at his beloved home in Mecosta
in my district in Michigan next month.
For over 40 years, Dr. Kirk taught
students about political theory, cul-
ture, and virtue. He also wrote more
than 30 books. Today, his legacy lives
on through the Russell Kirk Center
under the gracious leadership of his
wife, Annette.
Dr. Kirk is considered one of the pre-
eminent thinkers of his time. His first
book, ‘‘The Conservative Mind,’’ has
shaped the modern ideas of American
conservatism.
Dr. Kirk found his true joy in ad-
dressing college audiences because he
believed the key to the lasting success
of conservative ideas rested on shaping
the cultural and moral beliefs of the
next generation.
In his books, articles, speeches, and
interviews, Dr. Kirk’s wisdom has
shaped the thinking of generations of
conservatives around the world.
His ideas have personally helped me
in forming my own beliefs, and it is a
privilege to pay special tribute to Dr.
Kirk and his legacy today.

CELEBRATING 25TH ANNIVERSARY

Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise

of Home Instead Senior Care.
Since 1994, when Lori and Paul Hogan
founded Home Instead in Omaha, Ne-
braska, it has provided personalized
care, support, and education to aging
adults and their families.
Today, this network is the world’s
leading provider of in-home care serv-
ices for seniors, with more than 1,100
independently owned and operated
franchises that provide more than 75
million hours of care throughout the
United States and 12 international
markets.
Home Instead Senior Care offices em-
ploy 75,000 caregivers worldwide who
provide basic support services that en-
able seniors to live safely and com-
fortably in their own homes for as long

cated men and women of Home Instead

HONORING SARATOGA’S MARYLOU
WHITNEY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
New York (Ms. STEFANIK) for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor Marylou Whitney, the
‘‘Queen of Saratoga,’’ who, sadly,
passed away on July 19 at the age of 93.
Marylou embodied the spirit of a re-
vitalized Saratoga. She was graceful,
classic, sparkling, full of joy, and truly
one of a kind. Most of all, she loved her
community and gave so much of herself
to it.
She had a passion for horse racing
and was a fixture of the Saratoga Race
Course. She hosted a yearly racing sea-
son ball for many decades, where pro-
ceeds benefited track workers and local
organizations like Saratoga Hospital.
She was active and involved in philan-
thropy until her last months.
Her generosity, energy, and compas-
sion were unmatched. She was the
founder of the Saratoga Performing
Arts Center and the National Museum
of Dance.
Marylou often called Saratoga one of
her favorite homes, and those of us in
the community are unsurprised by
this. It is a community like no other,
and Marylou made it better for all of
us. Her deep commitment will leave a
mark on Saratoga for generations to
come.
I want to express my sincere condo-
lences to Marylou’s husband, John
Hendrickson, and her entire family.
I consider it an honor to have known
Marylou Whitney and an honor to
speak her memory into the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD. She will be missed.
HONORING ADIRONDACK’S RANDY PRESTON
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor and celebrate the life of
Randy Preston, Wilmington Town su-
pervisor, former chairman of the Essex
County Board of Supervisors, former
volunteer firefighter, former fire chief,
and fierce advocate for Essex County
and the Adirondack region.
After a long, courageous fight with
an aggressive brain tumor, Randy,
sadly, passed away on July 18. He was
60 years old.
He was a bipartisan leader on behalf
of Essex County. He voted for the in-
terests of the people, was beholden to
no one, and let no one deter him. He
was, undoubtedly, a champion for those
he represented.
Randy’s missions and advocacies for
the Adirondack region were innumer-
able. He was passionate about lowering
our tax burden and ensuring we had
ample funding for lifesaving emergency
medical services.
He was known not only for his
staunch advocacy but for his sense of
humor, his unapologetic convictions,
and his willingness to shoot straight
and be honest with people, whether a
Governor or a Congresswoman.
He was quick to tell me when he
thought a policy was right for his com-
munity and just as quick to tell me
when he thought a policy was wrong.
Mr. Speaker, I express my deepest
sympathies to Randy’s wife, Michelle,
and his entire family. It is a sincere
honor to enter Randy Preston’s mem-
ory and achievements into the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD.
HONORING MARIANO RIVERA, FIRST UNANIMOUS
INDUCTEE INTO BASEBALL HALL OF FAME
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, the
hallowed halls of the National Baseball
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New
York, welcomed six inductees last
weekend.
In 80 years, baseball has honored 232
players as the best of the best. Only
about 1 percent of the 19,500 who played
the game are enshrined here.
As a proud New Yorker, I can say the
hall includes 60 Yankees, and the
bronze busts of Bronx Bomber behe-
moths include Ruth, Berra, Gehrig,
Mantle, DiMaggio, Jackson, and more.
I rise today to honor Mariano Rivera,
the first unanimous inductee into the
Hall of Fame.
Mo, the Sandman, wore the Yankee
pinstripes with honor, pride, humility,
and dignity for 19 seasons. On the field,
number 42 was a 13-time All-Star and
won five World Series championships
with the Yankees, including being
named MVP in 1999.
Mo racked up a record 672 saves. His
cutter is legendary. He amassed 1,173
strikeouts and had a postseason ERA of
0.7, allowing only 11 runs in 96 appear-
ances, fewer postseason runs than the
number of people who have walked the
Moon.
Mo was the very definition of ‘‘auto-
matic,’’ as he was so often described.
Mariano is a man of faith and recog-
nized the importance of family support
through good times and struggles. He
is a mentor, a teacher, and dem-
onstrates quiet leadership that is far
too scarce today.
Mr. Speaker, as a young boy in Pan-
ama, Mariano used a homemade glove
of cardboard, tape, and netting. He had
holes in his cleats when he tried out for
the Yankees.
Through grit, hard work, and dogged
determination, Mo achieved the very
pinnacle of greatness in America’s
greatest game. He is the embodiment
of the American Dream.
Mr. Speaker, I say to Mr. Sandman:
Here’s to you. I tip my cap.

Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize two young Mon-
tanans who are among the best in
rodeo.
In this month’s National High School
Finals Rodeo in Wyoming, Montana
was well represented with competitors
from across the State. The National
High School Finals Rodeo drew about
1,500 finalists from 43 States, Mexico,
Canada, and Australia.
Two Montanans won buckles for plac-
ing in the top 10 in their event. Shai
McDonald of Gardiner took second in
barrel racing, and Brice Patterson of
Bozeman took fourth in bareback
riding.
Rodeo is a time-honored tradition in
Montana, and it is part of our way of
life.
The outstanding work ethic and dedi-
cation of these young athletes allows
them to compete and succeed at this
high level.
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Shai and
Brice on their accomplishments at the
National High School Finals Rodeo.

CONGRATULATING ARCHBISHOP
NIKITAS LULIAS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Tarpon Springs
native and devout University of Flor-
ida Gator and inspired Greek Orthodox
theologian, Archbishop Nikitas Lulias,
who will be enthroned this weekend in
London as the Greek Orthodox arch-
bishop of Great Britain under the Ecu-
menical Patriarchate of Constanti-
nople.
Archbishop Nikitas has had a blessed
life, which started with the retrieval of
the Gold Cross in Tarpon Springs for
the 1974 celebration of the Epiphany.
His proud parents, my great-aunt and
great-uncle, Gus and Kally Lulias,
knew at that moment that Nikitas was
destined for greatness.
Archbishop Nikitas has had an ex-
traordinary ecclesiastical career. His
devotion to orthodoxy and to the Holy
Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate
make him a worthy choice as the arch-
bishop of Great Britain.
I wish this son of Tarpon Springs,
Florida, and my constituent and my
cousin, a blessed ministry.
Axios, which means worthy.
RECOGNIZING PUBLIC SAFETY AIRCREWS
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to acknowledge a group of heroes
who work tirelessly to keep our coun-
try and communities safe.
Public safety aircrews ensure the
safety of our domestic airspace, repeat-
edly operating in very hazardous condi-
tions. They are also an essential form
of support for first responders during
disaster response and rescue missions.
Today, we honor the dedication and
devotion that these public servants
demonstrate and acknowledge those
who have made the ultimate sacrifice.
It is only right that a day is set aside
to recognize the thousands of men and
women who have served in this role. To
that end, I am reintroducing a resolu-
tion today to recognize July 26 as Na-
tional Public Safety Aviation Day.

RELEASE AUSTIN TICE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Washington (Mr. KILMER) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, almost 7
years ago, Austin Tice, an American
journalist, disappeared in Syria. Since
the day he vanished, his parents, fam-
ily, friends, and supporters have tire-
lessly worked to ensure that no stone
is left unturned and no avenue ignored
in a global campaign to see Austin re-
turned home safely.
As we approach the end of the sev-
enth year of Austin’s captivity, we re-
quest that whomever continues to hold
Austin release him immediately so
that he can return to his family and
his friends.
We also ask for the assistance of the
Government of Syria. I ask that they
do whatever they can to help facilitate
Austin’s release.
There are things that transcend poli-
tics and diplomacy, bridge cultural di-
vides, and need no translation across
different languages. Those are things
like love and hope, represented by a
mother and a father who wake up each
day with the unshakable faith in their
son and the belief that today could be
the day when they get the chance to
hug him again.
We ask for your help, without the as-
signment of blame or malice to any-
one, so that this year is the last that
Austin remains so far from home and
from family.
RESTORE OUR PARKS
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
support of the Restore Our Parks Act,
and I thank Mr. BISHOP for his leader-
ship and partnership on this bill.
I was lucky enough to grow up near
one of the crown jewels of our national
park system, the Olympic National
Park, right in my backyard in the Pa-
cific Northwest. I have seen firsthand
how our public lands have captivated
both visitors and residents alike and
served as key economic drivers for our
local communities.
I think there is little doubt that our
national parks are some of America’s
greatest natural and cultural treas-
ures. I am proud that my home State
boasts not only Olympic National
Park, but also Mount Rainier National
Park and North Cascades National
Park, true gems of the national park
system.
Unfortunately, these crown jewels
are getting a bit rusty, and they re-
quire our attention to return them to
glory. If you have visited one of our
parks lately, you will no doubt have
noticed that they are facing a good
problem.
In 2017, Washington State had a
record 8.45 million park visitors, in-
cluding families, campers, and adven-
turers, who came to explore our iconic
landscapes. While they were there,
these visitors spent more than $500 mil-
lion, supported more than 6,600 jobs,
and created nearly $700 million in eco-
nomic impact.
While this is undeniably great news
for Washington’s growing outdoor
economy, the rise in visitation has also
strained our park resources, like roads,
interpretive centers, campsites, and
trails, that visitors rely on to access
and truly experience our parks. If we as
a country don’t start investing in our
parks, I believe we risk loving them to
death.
The National Park Service manages
more than 400 sites across the country
and is facing a nearly $12 billion back-
log in necessary repairs. In Washington
State alone, our national parks suffer
from nearly $400 million in deferred re-
pairs needed to restore historical struc-
tures, fix eroding trails, fix roads, and
update unsafe electrical and drinking
water systems.
This significant maintenance back-
log threatens the health, accessibility,
and safety of our parks, their visitors,
and the communities that depend on
them. That is why we need to take this
opportunity to build on recent suc-
cesses of investing in our public lands
and turn our attention to passing the
Restore Our Parks and Public Lands
Act.
Passing this legislation sponsored by
my good friend from Utah (Mr. BISHOP)
will establish a long-term investment
in our parks that will create jobs and
boost economies throughout Wash-
ington State and across this country.
An analysis commissioned by The Pew
Charitable Trusts shows that investing
in the maintenance of our national
parks could create or support more
than 3,800 new jobs in Washington
State alone and 100,000 jobs across the
country.
Now, these days, Congress can hardly
agree on what day it is or what color
the sky is; but, with 300 Members of
the House of Representatives cospon-
soring this bill and 40 Members of the
Senate, it is crystal clear that this is
an area that we might actually see
some progress. My hope is that we can
get folks behind this and get this done.
f
RESTORE OUR PARKS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Utah (Mr. BISHOP) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
thank Mr. KILMER for leading off on
this particular issue and all the work
that he has been doing on this par-
ticular concept. It is important.
I am very happy that this bill has 300
cosponsors now here in the House. That
is the largest number of cosponsors
who have ever supported a bill coming
from the Natural Resources Com-
mittee. I think there are only 10 other
bills that have more cosponsors in the
House. It passed our committee on a
36–2 vote and is now awaiting the
chance of being heard here on the
House floor.
There is a companion bill in the Sen-
ate, not quite as good as our ours, that
already has one-third of the Senate as
cosponsors of that.
This is an idea whose time has actu-
ally come. We talk about the mainte-
nance backlog of our national parks
and all of our public lands, including
fish and wildlife land, BLM land, and
also our national forests.
Especially as we now enter August,
when there will be the largest partici-
pation of Americans going out to visit
these parks and public lands, it is im-
portant that their experience be a posi-
tive one and not be stopped by broken
roads, lack of sewers, lack of facilities,
or lack of any kind of access that they
may need. That is why it is so signifi-
cant.
We have almost around $17 billion of
maintenance backlog only in our
parks. If you add up the maintenance
backlog we have on all other public
lands, including our national forests, it
is $30 billion that we would need to
spend just to get them to standard—
not to do any kind of really human
moving it forward, but just to get them
to where they are workable, livable,
and enjoyable.
That kind of backlog did not take
place overnight. There are a lot of peo-
ple who are simply looking at saying:
Well, let’s just try and use the same
old stuff we have been using for a long
time. We will appropriate more money.
That doesn’t work. We have devel-
oped a significant problem that needs a
significant new solution. This solution
is one that was coming out of, actu-
ally, the administration that has the
support of over two-thirds of the House
and that has the support of one-third of
the Senate. This is one of those things
which, all of a sudden, this is a cool
idea to solve an existing problem that
we have ignored for a number of years.
The goal of this is to take excess—
and that is the key word—royalties
that are coming from energy produc-
tion on all Federal lands, all kinds of
energy production, whether it is tradi-
tional, renewable, onshore, or offshore,
any kind of royalties coming into the
Federal Government from those. If
there is an excess, which means we
take the commitments we have already
to things like GOMESA and LWCF, and
after those are funded, then if there is
excess, that excess now goes into a
fund to start working at these kinds of
problems, to solve our problems with
public lands. The restoration fund only
receives the amounts after all these
other programs have received that.
If there is no excess in the royalties—
I clearly doubt that will happen, but if
there is no excess in the royalties, then
there is no money that goes into this
program.
Some people have said this is manda-
tory spending. No, it is not.
Mandatory spending, by definition,
means you have to spend the money
whether it appears or not; you have to
find it from somewhere else. This is
one of those programs that said, if
there is excess, then the first billion of
this money will go to fund our national

parks, our public lands. If there is no
excess, then you don’t have to find it
anywhere else because there will be no
money that goes to that.
This is not mandatory in any way.
Also, some people are saying, well,
maybe there should be an offset for
this new program. This is really not a
new program. The parks and public
lands exist. The responsibility to make
sure that they are viable, they are
paid, and they are sustainable already
exists. This is an existing program.
We are not taking anything from any
other program for this. We are simply
basing it on what is already our exist-
ing responsibility.
If you were to try and go through a
traditional approach of trying to ap-
propriate more money through our
budgeting process, that wouldn’t have
to have an offset. What we are talking
about here is existing programs, exist-
ing needs, and existing responsibilities.
We have spent a whole lot of time
buying up land. The Federal Govern-
ment owns one-third of America al-
ready. It is easy to buy up more prop-
erty. It is easy to establish a park be-
cause that sounds really cool. You get
your name on it, and it gives you a leg-
acy. The hard part is maintaining that
land.
And for heaven’s sake, if we are going
to take the responsibility and build a
legacy, to actually buy something and
create something, we have to take the
responsibility of maintaining it, and
this is exactly what we are talking
about.
I am so proud that there are so many
Republicans and so many Democrats
who have realized this is our obliga-
tion, this is our responsibility, and we
have to do it.
This bill is extremely important be-
cause it is a proper approach to solving
an existing problem. I encourage the
leaders of this House to bring it to the
floor soon so it can be debated and
heard.

PRAYER
Rabbi Gershon Avtzon, Yeshivas
Lubavitch Cincinnati, Cincinnati,
Ohio, offered the following prayer:
Almighty God, master of the uni-
verse, I invoke Your blessing today on
the Members of this honorable institu-
tion, the House of Representatives of
the United States of America. May
they humbly serve their constitu-
encies, aware that creating just legisla-
tion is one of the seven laws that You,
almighty God, gave all humanity
through Noah, as detailed in Genesis.
Almighty God, as a descendant of
Chassidic Jews who fled the Stalinist
regime that persecuted religious ob-
servance, I am especially grateful and
blessed to be in America, the nation
called the ‘‘country of kindness’’ by
the great spiritual leader of our gen-
eration, the Lubavitcher Rebbe Melech
HaMoshiach, Rabbi Menachem Mendel
Schneerson. We thank you for the free-
dom we have here to practice our faith,
and we pray for those who still suffer
persecution around the world.
While legislating, by definition, in-
cludes differences of opinion and rig-
orous debate, I pray that we, neverthe-
less, anticipate our shared bright fu-
ture in the time of redemption and,
thus, remain ‘‘one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for
all.’’
Amen.

lic for which it stands, one nation under God,

Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I
would like to take this opportunity to
thank the rabbi for coming to the Cap-
itol today to share with us a time in
prayer, a time when we often need it.
America has been through many bat-
tles. We have many debates. But we al-
ways come out strong, and we come
out together, at the end of the day.
I thank the rabbi for his kind prayer
and thoughtfulness as we proceed for-

HONORING THE PAYNE
FELLOWSHIP
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor the Donald M. Payne,
Sr., International Development Grad-
uate Fellowship Program.
My father, the late Donald M. Payne,
was committed to human rights at
home, in Africa, and around the world.
I am honored by the Payne Fellows’
commitment to my father’s legacy, and
I have developed a deep appreciation
for everything they have done to uplift
humanity.
I am proud that the fellowship named
for my father helps talented young peo-
ple enter the USAID Foreign Service
program. Today, the Payne Fellows are
leading the charge on some of the
greatest global challenges of our time.
Since its inception in 2013, the pro-
gram has trained 50 talented young in-
dividuals who come from diverse back-
grounds to enrich and enhance the
USAID Foreign Service.
This year, I hosted one of the Payne
Fellows in my office. Her name is
Meklit Gebru.
Meklit’s intellect, work ethic,
humor, and, most of all, her positive
attitude will truly be missed in my of-
fice. The day after her arrival, she was
writing questions for me to use in Com-
mittee on Homeland Security sub-
committee hearings.
Again, I thank the USAID and the
Payne Fellows for their commitment
to providing humanitarian efforts
while in support of America’s foreign
policy.
f
REMEMBERING THE CARLTON
COMPLEX FIRE
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, it has
been 5 years since the largest single
wildfire in Washington State history.
The Carlton Complex fire raged
through north-central Washington,
burning more than a quarter of a mil-
lion acres and leaving more than 500
homes and structures destroyed in its
path. Still today, the communities,
small businesses, and families in
Okanogan County continue to rebuild
and work to address the long-term con-
sequences of this disaster.
While the devastation was heart-
breaking, what we saw on the ground
was a testament to the resilience and
spirit of Washingtonians, as well as the
generosity and bravery of those from
across the region and the Nation who
came to north-central Washington’s
aid.

frightening days of late July 2014, more

than 2,800 firefighters from across the
country poured in to assist the fire-
fight. Today, I rise to recognize and re-
member the heroic efforts of those
thousands of firefighters, first respond-
ers, and volunteers who worked tire-
lessly and at great personal risk.

FIGHT AGAINST ELIMINATING
BROAD-BASED CATEGORICAL
ELIGIBILITY
(Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am
here this afternoon to raise strong con-
cerns about a rule that the Trump ad-
ministration recently announced on
eliminating broad-based categorical
eligibility.
If implemented, this rule will cut 3
million people off of SNAP, 13 percent
of whom are elderly and 7 percent of
whom are children. In addition, 500,000
kids will lose access to free school
meals.
I will put it simply: This will in-
crease food insecurity and hurt work-
ing families.
President Trump wants to, literally,
take the food off the table of working
families so that he can give tax breaks
to the well-off and the well-connected.
This proposed rule is against the will
of Congress. Last year, we worked on a
bipartisan farm bill, and despite some
discussion on this, Congress agreed to
let States maintain their flexibility to
accommodate low-income households.
That is why I encourage my col-
leagues in the House and Senate to join
me and fight every battle this adminis-
tration wages against those who strug-
gle.
Let us demand an end to this Presi-
dent’s cruelty, and let us work to end
hunger now.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
HONORING THE LIFE OF ROY
BATES
(Mr. BARR asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to honor the life of a very special man
and my good friend, Roy Bates of Win-
chester, Kentucky.
Mr. Bates, a true patriot, passed
away on July 4, 2019, on Independence
Day, appropriately.
Roy Bates was quite eager to serve
his country and attempted unsuccess-
fully to enlist in the Navy and the
Army when he was not yet of legal age.
In 1950, when he was 18 years old, he en-
listed in the Marine Corps and went to
Parris Island for training.
He was assigned to Company C, 1st
Battalion, 7th Regiment, 1st Division.
He was soon sent to Korea to join his
fellow marines.
On September 1, 1951, just 3 days be-
fore his 19th birthday, Mr. Bates was
on patrol when his group was am-
bushed. They were taking heavy fire.
Crawling on his belly, trying to reach
cover, he heard the dreaded click of a
land mine beneath him. His left leg was
blown away, and his right leg sustained
numerous wounds.
Severely wounded, he was carried off
the field by two fellow marines. One of
those who carried him off was killed in
action a few days later. Many years
later, Mr. Bates was reunited with
Royce Henry, the other marine who
saved him.
Mr. Bates spent 7 years in and out of
hospitals and had 32 surgeries. He re-
ceived a Purple Heart as well as numer-
ous other medals.
He married his wife, Betty, and they
had four children.
Mr. Bates eventually returned home
to Winchester, where he always cher-
ished a deep love for his country and
for the Marine Corps.
He was a well-respected member of
his community who exemplified good
character and a positive attitude all of
his life.
Mr. Bates and his fellow veterans are
true heroes. He willingly served to pro-
tect and defend the freedoms that we
enjoy today. He faced life with unwav-
ering faith in God and love of country.
Mr. Speaker, I am humbled to honor
the life of Mr. Roy Bates before the
United States Congress.

IT IS TIME FOR SENATE TO ACT
ON IMMIGRATION
(Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to thank the
House for passing H.R. 3239 to provide
humanitarian standards for migrants
and refugees in Customs and Border
Protection custody at our border.
Having visited the U.S.-Mexico bor-
der now twice in the past 12 months, I
know how desperately this bill was
needed.
We have good news and bad news.
The good news is that the children, the
young children, are no longer being
separated from their biological par-
ents, although we did see 310 children
separated from aunts, uncles, and
grandparents.
But the worst news was the migrants
who we saw held in overcrowded condi-
tions for up to 40 to 60 days without
any access to basic services, like a hot
meal or a shower or being able to brush
their teeth.
These are inhumane conditions and a
human rights violation.
That is why I was proud to cosponsor
the bill sponsored by Dr. RAUL RUIZ to
enact critical safety, nutrition, and hy-
giene standards for migrants in cus-
tody. I was pleased that the House ac-
cepted my amendments to protect
women from sexual assault at the bor-
der.
HONORING LABOR LEADER
HECTOR FIGUEROA
(Ms. VELÁZQUEZ asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. VELÁZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise
to honor Hector Figueroa, a champion
for workers, a New Yorker, and proud
Puerto Rican, who, sadly, passed last
week.
While he was relentless in advocating
for members of his union, SEIU 32BJ,
he was also on the front lines helping
taxi drivers, fast food employees, and
workers in every sector. To him, any-
one who was oppressed was an ally, and
he was ready to join them in common
cause.
Most recently, he was central to
building support for relief in Puerto
Rico after Hurricane Maria.
His belief that everyone deserves re-
spect extended beyond his work as a
labor leader. Hector treated everyone,
from the youngest organizers to the
most powerful elected officials, with
genuine kindness.
Just last week, this House voted to
raise the Federal minimum wage. I like
to think, wherever he is, that this will
bring a smile to Hector’s face.
We will honor his memory by advanc-
ing the causes that inspired him.
Hector always said, ‘‘We’ll keep orga-
nizing.’’
Yes, my friend, we will.

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado?
There was no objection.
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, the
Rules Committee met last night and
reported a rule, House Resolution 519,
providing for consideration of H.R.
3877, which is the Bipartisan Budget
Act of 2019, under a closed rule. The
rule provides 1 hour of debate equally
divided and controlled by the chair and
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on the Budget, and provides for
one motion to recommit.
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 549, the Venezuela TPS
Act of 2019, also under a closed rule.
The rule provides 30 minutes of debate
equally divided and controlled by the
chair and ranking minority member of
the Committee on the Judiciary, and
one motion to recommit, with or with-
out instructions.
Finally, the rule provides same-day
authority through the legislative day
of tomorrow, Friday, July 26, 2019.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased we are
here today to bring up two important
bipartisan pieces of legislation. Let me
start with H.R. 3877, the Bipartisan
Budget Act of 2019.
For months, House Democrats have
negotiated with the White House and
the Senate in order to agree on budget
levels for fiscal year 2020 so Congress
can complete all the appropriations
bills and avoid another governmental
shutdown like we saw at the beginning
of this year.
Despite resistance from my friends
on the Republican side of the aisle, the
House is well underway with the appro-
priations process. We have passed 10 of
the 12 appropriations bills, which fund
nearly 96 percent of the Federal Gov-
ernment.
Unfortunately, the Senate has yet to
take up any of the 12 appropriations
bills and, in fact, none of the bills have
even been marked up by the Senate.
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019
will set overall budget levels to avoid
drastic cuts next year and allow House
and Senate appropriators to negotiate
final bills to avoid a shutdown and pro-
vide certainty to Americans and all the
Federal employees who work for them.
Importantly, this bill will also raise
the debt ceiling for the next 2 years.
Put simply, we cannot put in jeopardy
the full faith and credit of the United
States of America. This bill rightfully
provides the Treasury Department the
ability to continue paying our bills and
honor the commitments the U.S. has
already made.
While Members on both sides of the
aisle may not like everything in this
deal, it is a compromise which supports
critical investments for all Americans
and, I believe, sets us on a strong path
forward this fiscal year.
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 549, the Venezuela TPS
Act of 2019. This bipartisan bill was de-
bated on Tuesday under suspension of
the rules, and I was disappointed more
of my friends from the other side of the
aisle didn’t join every Democrat, 37 Re-
publicans, and 1 Independent, to help
get to the two-thirds vote required
under suspension.
Venezuela is currently in crisis.
Their democratic institutions have
been corrupted under the Maduro re-
gime and, according to the U.N. Ref-
ugee Agency and the International Or-
ganization for Migration, more than 4
million Venezuelans have fled the
country.
I want to applaud the work of Rep-
resentatives DARREN SOTO, MARIO
DIAZ-BALART, and my friend, DONNA
SHALALA, from the Rules Committee,
for their work to advance this bill to
provide temporary protected status for
Venezuelan refugees already in the
United States. That is why I am glad
we have included this bill in the rule
today, to ensure this bill passes the
House as soon as possible.
Mr. Speaker, overall, this rule pro-
vides for consideration of two very im-
portant measures we need to get done
before the upcoming district work pe-
riod. I urge all my colleagues to sup-
port the rule and the underlying bills.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
I want to thank my good friend, the
gentleman from Colorado (Mr. PERL-
MUTTER) for yielding me the customary
30 minutes.
Mr. Speaker, we are here today on
two items, both of which are actually
bipartisan ideas. And though this has
been an eventful week and month at
the Rules Committee, I am pleased
that we are ending on such a high note
before we return to our districts.
Of course, this rule is not all sun-
shine and roses. It does add same-day
authority for any measure through to-
morrow. My good friend, Chairman
MCGOVERN, had a term for this proce-
dure in the last Congress. He called it
‘‘martial law.’’
I would remind my friends that push-
ing through bills on short notice, at
the last minute, and using the martial
law procedure is a recipe for potential
disaster, and certainly is no way to
make good law. It is also contrary to
the commitment the Democrats made,
upon taking the majority, to provide 72
hours notice before bringing a bill to
the floor for a vote; a rule they already
are violating with one of the measures
today, albeit only by a matter of hours.
I would also remind my friends that
with consideration of the budget agree-
ment today, there is absolutely no
other legislation that is so critical and
that must be done this week to justify
needing this extraordinary procedure.
The only thing my friends would use
this martial law for is to advance high-
ly-partisan messaging bills in order to
appease some faction or other in their
caucus ahead of the recess. That is a
waste of the committee’s time and a
waste of the House’s time. And I assure
you, you will have plenty of time for
these types of bills in the fall.
On a much more positive note,
though, as I said at the start of my re-
marks, the two bills covered by this
rule today are actually bipartisan, and
we should all be encouraged by that.
One bill, H.R. 549, the Venezuela TPS
Act of 2019, was brought up on the floor
on suspension on Tuesday. It, unfortu-
nately, failed to reach the required
two-thirds threshold needed for passage
under suspension of the rules. But I
have every confidence that it will eas-
ily pass the House later today under
this rule; and I certainly look forward
to supporting it with my friends on the
other side of the aisle.
Mr. Speaker, a lot of people talk
about the need for bipartisanship
around here, but in our second bill for
today, we have an excellent example of
what the word actually means. H.R.
3877, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019,
is as advertised. It is a bipartisan bill
that sets budgetary needs for fiscal
years 2020 and 2021. It suspends the debt
limit until July 31 of 2021 to protect
the full faith and credit of the Nation.
And it avoids devastating sequestra-
tion cuts.
I said a moment ago that this is an
excellent example of what bipartisan-
ship means, and I truly believe that to
be the case. This is a bill that was ne-
gotiated between the President of the
United States and the leaders of both

H7392 July 25, 2019
parties in both Houses of Congress, re-
sulting in the kind of bipartisan, bi-
cameral budget deal in which all Mem-
bers can have confidence.
Is this bill a perfect one? No, of
course not. No bill ever is. I, myself,
would have preferred that this bill ad-
dress entitlement reform and deficit
reduction, and I am certain that some
of my friends on the other side of the
aisle would have preferred a lower de-
fense spending number. Some of my
friends on my side of the aisle would
have preferred a higher defense spend-
ing number.
But even when we both agree that
this bill isn’t perfect, it is still a good
deal for the American people.
I think this bill achieves four bipar-
tisan goals that I would like to high-
light.
First, with the passage of this bill,
we would avoid the horrific con-
sequences of defaulting on our national
debt, which would lead to an economic
chaos the likes of which none of us
should ever wish to see.
Second, in setting new budgetary lev-
els, we will avoid the automatic and
devastating sequestration cuts that
would have taken effect at the begin-
ning of October of this year.
Third, it allows us to move forward
with clarity on the appropriations
process for the coming fiscal year and
probably for the fiscal year after that.
And fourth, it allows us to resume
the process of rebuilding our military
after years of underfunding left it with
a severe readiness crisis.
When the Commander in Chief tells
us that he needs something to defend
America, there can only be one answer,
and that answer is yes.
Mr. Speaker, I think every Member
of the House can be proud of the work
done by the leaders of both parties to
get us to this point. All five of the peo-
ple in question, the President, the
Speaker, the House Republican Leader,
the Senate Majority Leader, and the
Senate Minority Leader, negotiated in
good faith and produced a compromise
bill that all five of them stand behind.
In order to get there, every one of
them had to give up some things. That
is what it takes to make a compromise,
and this is what makes this bipartisan
bill possible.
I know there are Members of this
House who are disappointed with this
bill. I, too, as I mentioned earlier, am
not completely satisfied with it. But I
trust my leaders to negotiate on our
behalf. And when they came back with
this deal, I trusted that this was the
best compromise they could reach. Ev-
erybody had to give something to get
something, and I trust that the leaders
of my party achieved as much as they
could in the course of the negotiation.
The same should hold for my friends
across the aisle with their leaders of
their party. Working together, all five
did exactly what leaders are supposed
to do; they led and, in doing so, came
to the best deal possible, not for each
party, but for the whole Nation.
Now it is up to the Members of the
House to say yes and move forward
with the passage of this bill.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr.
COLE for his comments, particularly
about the Venezuelan TPS legislation,
as well as the Bipartisan Budget Act of
2019. Truly, these are two bills that are
supported by both sides of the aisle.
Neither one is exactly perfect, but they
are both good, and that is the kind of
legislation we need to get through this
body to the Senate and to the White
House.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.
SHALALA), my good friend.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong support of this rule and H.R. 549,
the Venezuela TPS Act of 2019, this is
lifesaving, bipartisan legislation to
designate TPS for Venezuelans, and I
appreciate the generous remarks of
Ranking Member COLE.
The socialist, narco regimes of Hugo
Chavez and Nicolas Maduro have
plunged Venezuela into catastrophe.
Venezuela was once a thriving democ-
racy. Now the economy, the health sec-
tor, the education system, and vir-
tually every democratic institution is
in ruins. The Venezuelan economy has
completely collapsed, and the inflation
is expected to reach 10 million percent
this year.
More than 4 million refugees have
fled the continuous worsening condi-
tions in Venezuelan. They have fled to
Colombia, to Brazil, to Peru, to so
many countries, and they have come to
the United States, following the foot-
steps of millions of refugees before
them; those who have helped make this
the greatest country on Earth.
b 1230
They have come to our shores in
search of the freedom, democracy, and
security that the Maduro regime has
stolen from them, and so many Ven-
ezuelans have come to south Florida
where they have contributed so much
to our diverse community.
In my district, there are approxi-
mately 17,000 Venezuelan-born resi-
dents, so this is personal for us. These
are our neighbors, our friends, our stu-
dents, and our teachers. My constitu-
ents cannot safely return.
As the vote on Tuesday dem-
onstrated, we are ready to take legisla-
tive action to allow Venezuelans to
apply for temporary protective status.
TPS has bipartisan support in the
House and in the Senate, but now it is
time for the Senate to take this bill up.
Our hope is that passage of this bill
in our House will light the fire under
the Senate. Bipartisan TPS legislation
has passed through the Senate commit-
tees. Now more than ever, it is time for
them to take it up and to get TPS
signed into law.
TPS is a fundamental, literally, life-
saving component to our approach to
the crisis in Venezuela, but TPS alone
won’t solve the crisis. The United
States and the international commu-
nity must continue to put pressure on
the regime to facilitate a peaceful
change in leadership. We must expose
the corrupt networks that prop up the
Maduro government and meet the ur-
gent basic needs of the poor, the hun-
gry, and the sick.
Because our ultimate goal is to se-
cure a stable and peaceful transition of
power for the Venezuelan people, I
want to thank my Florida colleagues,
including lead sponsors Mr. SOTO and
Mr. DIAZ-BALART, as well as DEBBIE
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ and DEBBIE
MUCARSEL-POWELL and also our Puerto
Rican colleague, JENNIFFER GONZÁLEZ-
COLÓN. I also want to thank Chairman
MCGOVERN for his work to help make
sure this bill was included in this rule.
Viva Venezuela.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by
doing something unusual in a rules de-
bate. I want to agree with everything
my good friend from Florida had to
say. I am very pleased with her work
and my colleague Mr. DIAZ-BALART’s
work on this legislation, as well as the
other Members that she mentioned.
This is an important bill for us to
pass for exactly the reasons my friend
laid out. The reality is we have an un-
folding political crisis in Venezuela,
and we have people at fear for their life
and, frankly, leaving a collapsing econ-
omy.
This country ought to be a refuge for
people in those kinds of circumstances,
so I share my friend’s hope that we get
this done here and then we get action
in the United States Senate.
I do want to advise the Chair, Mr.
Speaker, that, if we defeat the previous
question, I will offer an amendment to
the rule to immediately bring up H.R.
336, the Strengthening America’s Secu-
rity in the Middle East Act of 2019,
with an amendment that will make it
identical to S. 1, which passed the Sen-
ate in a bipartisan vote of 77–23 earlier
this year.
This bill includes many critical pro-
visions, but the most important sec-
tion of this bill is the Combating BDS
Act of 2019, which will allow a State or
local government to adopt measures to
divest assets from entities using boy-
cotts, divestments, or sanctions to in-
fluence Israel’s policies.
Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, the
House passed H. Res. 246, a nonbinding
resolution opposing the Boycott, Di-
vestment, and Sanctions movement;
and while I appreciate the House’s ac-
tion in passing that resolution, we can
do better in opposing this heinous prac-
tice than simply passing a nonbinding
resolution. Actions speak louder than
words. We cannot just say we believe in
something. We must do something.

July 25, 2019
H.R. 336 would do something. It
would allow a State or local govern-
ment to stand with us in defense of
Israel.
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with the ex-
traneous material, immediately prior
to the vote on the previous question.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma?
There was no objection.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF),
my good friend, for further explanation
of this amendment.
Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, I want to thank my good
friend from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE) for
yielding.
H.R. 336, the Strengthening Amer-
ica’s Security Act in the Middle East
Act, is the House companion to S. 1.
This bill was so important that the
United States Senate made it their top
legislative priority and passed it with
overwhelming bipartisan support.
H.R. 336, a bill introduced by Rank-
ing Member MCCAUL, combines four
various policy initiatives that deal
with the United States-Israel relation-
ship. This legislation authorizes assist-
ance in weapons transfers to Israel; ex-
tends defense cooperation with Jordan;
establishes additional sanctions on in-
dividuals supporting the Syrian Gov-
ernment; and, most importantly, al-
lows States to divest from entities that
are boycotting Israel.
Just this week, the House passed,
with bipartisan support, a resolution
opposing the anti-Israel, anti-Semitic
Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions
movement, also known as BDS. That
resolution was a great stepping stone,
but we need to do more. Now we must
pass legislation with some teeth.
There is no doubt that Israel is our
greatest ally in the Middle East. It is
the only Jewish state. Since her birth
71 years ago, the U.S.-Israel relation-
ship has continued to grow stronger as
we find new means for cooperation and
ensure the safety of her and her people.
It is time for the Democrat leader-
ship to bring this crucial bill to the
House floor for a vote. It is vital for all
of us to come together and show our
support for Israel. It is not solely Re-
publican and not solely Democrat. We
must continue to come together as a
unified body to stamp out anti-Semi-
tism and hate towards the only Jewish
state, Israel.
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I would just say to my friend, Mr.
KUSTOFF, he and I served together on
Financial Services, and there is agree-
ment here. In fact, this resolution that
he described as a great stepping stone,
we just took and passed the resolution
2 days ago with 398 ‘‘aye’’ votes in
favor of that.
Today, though, we are here to focus
on two other things, both of which are
substantial measures in and of them-
selves, and we can look forward to
other measures involving the anti-BDS
movement or whatever we may be, but
to deal with anti-Semitism.
But today we are here, really, to ap-
plaud a deal that was cut among all of
our leaders, Democrats and Repub-
licans, that eliminates drastic cuts, ap-
proves funding, or funding levels, for
the next year to 2 years, and allows
America to move forward without the
real potential of shutdown like we had
for 35 days when the White House, ear-
lier in this year, refused to deal on cer-
tain subjects and appropriations.
Thankfully, we got through that.
I think, at this point, cooler heads
have prevailed, and we are moving for-
ward on the Bipartisan Budget Act; and
then, as Ms. SHALALA said, we are deal-
ing with, really, a humanitarian crisis
that exists in Venezuela, at this point,
to provide temporary protected status
to those who fled their country, who
are in America, many of whom are in
Florida, to provide them some protec-
tion while they are here and to make
sure that they can comfortably, if you
will, remain here and not fear that
they are going to have to be deported
back to Venezuela, where we know
there is a lot of strife and danger.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
I agree with my friend very much.
These two pieces of legislation are ex-
cellent, and they are must pass, and I
look forward with working with him on
that.
But this is such an extraordinary
outbreak of bipartisanship, I think we
should go for broke and bring up this
other legislation as well, which is
equally bipartisan, as my friend says. I
don’t want to waste this magic mo-
ment, Mr. Speaker. We don’t get many
of them around here.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the
distinguished gentleman from New
York (Mr. ZELDIN), my good friend.
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
opposition to the rule and urge my col-
leagues to defeat the previous question
so the House may take up H.R. 336, a
bipartisan legislative package that
would help fight back against the BDS
movement, protect U.S. security in the
Middle East by strengthening our alli-
ances with Israel and Jordan, and sanc-
tion nefarious actors like Assad.
The Senate version of this bill, S. 1,
passed with an overwhelming bipar-
tisan majority of 77–23. Surprisingly,
the major point of contention for this
package is the Combating BDS Act of
2019, a bipartisan bill that garnered
over 100 cosponsors last Congress and
would help combat the BDS movement.
It is okay to have reasonable, legiti-
mate concerns with any government in
the world, including our own, but this
hate-filled movement is not all about
affirming the rights of Palestinians, as
some suggest. It is about
delegitimizing Israel by turning it into
a pariah state cut off from all trade,
tourism, military, diplomatic, and cul-
tural ties with the rest of the world.
BDS, whose founder was blatantly
anti-Semitic, amounts to a declaration
of economic war against Israel, with a
goal of destroying it as the only Jewish
state on Earth.
I hear of college students all across
our entire country who share very per-
sonal testimonials of how they are
being targeted by blatant anti-Semi-
tism in the name of BDS.
Thankfully, this week, the House
passed H. Res. 246, a resolution to
forcefully condemn the BDS move-
ment.
Making a strong statement is great
and should be celebrated, but we should
wake up the next morning asking our-
selves, challenging each other to what
we can do about it.
S. 1 has already passed the Senate,
but it is not being brought up in this
House, despite nearly 200 Members
signing the discharge petition and over
100 cosponsors last Congress.
This bill does not impede the right of
any individual American to boycott or
criticize Israel, as some suggest. In-
stead, H.R. 336 would combat the BDS
movement by simply allowing State
and local governments to have the
right to counter the BDS movement by
ending contracts with companies that
boycott Israel, if they so choose, while
protecting U.S. security in the Middle
East.
There were 350 cosponsors on the
statement that was made earlier this
week. There were nearly 400 votes on
the House floor. Republicans and
Democrats worked together through a
process, from drafting the legislation
to getting the bill marked up at com-
mittee, to passing on the House floor,
and we should celebrate making a
great statement.
Now we should be passing a bill with
teeth. We could do it right now. If this
bill gets added to the voting before we
leave here this week, I guarantee it
passes.
So not only did we, earlier this week,
make a strong statement to combat
the anti-Israel, anti-Semitic BDS
movement, but we woke up the next
day motivated to actually challenge
ourselves to do something about it, and
we got it done.
The one thing that is concerning is
that we keep asking for a vote on H.R.
336, and we are not getting an answer
in response as to why it is not coming
up for a vote or when it will come up
for a vote. I would challenge anyone
who has an answer to this question to
please let us know, because we don’t
know what else to do other than bring-
ing up today’s proposal, for example.
But if this is something that has al-
ready passed the Senate with a strong
bipartisan majority, it is the right
thing to do. We have almost unani-
mously condemned the BDS movement,
and we are here on the House floor to-
gether with a bill that would pass,
strongly?

H7394 July 25, 2019
Let’s get it done. Let’s get it done
right now. There are a lot of people
who would celebrate that big win.
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I just want to continue to focus on
what is before us today, and what is be-
fore us today is dealing with the hu-
manitarian crisis in Venezuela and
dealing with the budget of the United
States of America, two accomplish-
ments, both bipartisan, that I think
will really assist and protect so many
people who fled Venezuela to America,
and particularly to Florida, but also
provides for funding caps that help us
with veterans, with infrastructure,
with foreign affairs across the board,
with our military.
The President tweeted the other day
that the Bipartisan Budget Act was a
real accomplishment for veterans and
our military, and I agree.
b 1245
I am sorry that Mr. ZELDIN and Mr.
COLE would like to bring up something
else.
In fact, I was fortunate enough to be
in the chair when the BDS bill and the
resolution, H. Res. 246, I think it was,
was being debated and passed by an
overwhelming majority and it really
was a huge accomplishment, which I
am afraid the arguments that the gen-
tleman is making now minimize what
was accomplished just 2 days ago.
I think we need to remain focused on
these major pieces of legislation that
will guide America for the next 2 years
and will protect Venezuelans who fled
their country for at least 18 months.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. ZELDIN), my good friend.
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman who just spoke for ex-
pressing his gratitude and his celebra-
tion for what passed earlier this week
and I appreciate his support for what
passed earlier this week.
I would actually suggest that doing
something about that statement that
we made is not minimizing the state-
ment that we made, it is actually
maximizing the statement that we
made.
We are minimizing the statement
that we made if we wake up the next
day and decide that we are not going to
do anything about it by passing a bill
with teeth.
Again, I would ask anyone who has
an answer to this question, when can
we have a vote on S. 1 and H.R. 336? It
is a simple question. I don’t have the
answer to it, but if anyone can answer
that for us, it would really help those
who genuinely, sincerely, passionately
believe in this legislation.
I know from my conversations with
colleagues on the opposite side of the
aisle, I know of a number of colleagues
who would enthusiastically vote for S.
1/H.R. 336. And I know of friends, col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle
who have asked for a vote on S. 1/H.R.
336.
Mr. Speaker, now would be a good op-
portunity, I don’t want to put the gen-
tleman on the spot, but if anybody can
answer that question, we are very in-
terested in having a vote scheduled on
this bill.
Let’s maximize the statement that
we made by adding that. It will pass
and it will go to the President and it
will be signed into law, and we will cel-
ebrate not only a strong statement
made, but maximizing that strong
statement made by doing something
about it and passing a bill with teeth.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time.
I want to begin by thanking my col-
league for a good debate and, frankly,
for both of us having the enjoyable and
unusual position of being in favor of
both the pieces of legislation that are
dealt with in the rule.
I want to go back and talk, just brief-
ly, about the Venezuela TPS legisla-
tion that our good friend and our fel-
low Rules Committee member, Ms.
SHALALA, has. That is an important
piece of legislation. That is an impor-
tant statement of American principles.
I think it is an important institutional
moment for us in the House, because
we are passing something jointly to try
and get the other body to do something
jointly as well, because I am quite con-
vinced if that got to the floor, it would
pass in a very substantial bipartisan
way. I am glad to work with my friends
to achieve this.
I suppose I am even more pleased
about the bipartisan Budget Act. I
want to again congratulate the five
leaders on both sides of the aisle who
actually got this done. The President
of the United States sat down and ne-
gotiated this.
We have a lot of people on my side of
the aisle that are big supporters of the
President of the United States. I hope
they show that support today by actu-
ally voting for the deal that he nego-
tiated and has tweeted out that he sup-
ports.
Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate
in our own Chamber the Speaker and
the Republican leader, Ms. PELOSI and
Mr. MCCARTHY, for also participating
in that and working together.
I know each one of them had to go
back to their caucuses and probably de-
liver some news that people in those
caucuses did not want to hear. That is
certainly true on our side of the aisle.
I know it is true on the gentleman’s
side of the aisle as well.
That is what leaders do. They come
to agreements and they go back, and
they explain to their supporters, ‘‘Hey,
I couldn’t get you everything you
wanted, even though I wanted those
things, too,’’ but every now and then
you need to sit down and put what is
good for the American people first.
We all know that a catastrophic debt
ceiling crisis and default, what that
would do to our economy, how many
people that would put out of work.
We all know what having an agreed-
upon deal in terms of stability going
forward for 2 years means for the
American military, but for every other
agency of government as well. These
are huge, huge wins even if there was
some sacrifice.
Now, would I like to do some more on
deficit reduction and entitlement re-
form? I absolutely would. We will con-
tinue to work on that.
But any time I can come to an agree-
ment that saves the economy, that pro-
vides government stability, that gives
our military the ability to plan and to
rebuild itself over a 2-year period, and
that the Commander in Chief is asking
me to do, I am going to vote for that
every single time.
I am very proud to be voting for it
with my friends on the other side of
the aisle, who also, again, had objec-
tives in this that they weren’t able to
reach.
Finally, I would be remiss—I do this
as seldom as possible—but I will praise
the United States Senate, because the
majority leader and the minority lead-
er were also indispensable in getting
this done, and in many ways probably
came to an agreement between them-
selves faster even than the other par-
ties involved. But at the end of the
day, again, both of those leaders, the
majority leader and the minority lead-
er in the Senate, had to go back and
tell their caucuses, ‘‘Look, this is the
best deal I can get. I can’t get every-
thing I want. We are not going to
achieve everything we would like to
achieve.’’
Again, I respect my colleagues who
look at the deal and say, ‘‘That is not
good enough.’’ That is fine, but can
they tell me what is better that they
can get passed?
I see no alternative to this particular
piece of legislation that is not worse.
The worst thing to do would be to de-
feat this bipartisan budget agreement
and then deal with sequester or a debt
crisis or a shutdown or, at best, a CR
that would project these quarrels for-
ward into the next year.
It is already a pretty tense political
time between all sides.
The fact, again, that we are coming
together and making a bipartisan
agreement really reflects well on our
respective leaders on each side of the
aisle and certainly on the President.
I think if the Members will vote in a
bipartisan fashion, it will reflect well
on them and on the institution as well.
Mr. Speaker, I know some doubted
that we could ever work together. I
think this is the most significant thing
we have done together this year, and I
just want to thank all concerned.
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to sup-
porting it enthusiastically. I hope oth-
ers of our colleagues on both sides of
the aisle will do the same.
Mr. Speaker, with that, while I op-
pose the rule, I would certainly urge
passage of both these important pieces
of legislation, and I look forward to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7395
July 25, 2019
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman
from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE) for his com-
ments. I almost thought he was going
to support the rule. I just felt it was
moving in that direction, but not
quite, but I do want to thank him.
And, particularly, I think, during the
35 days that we were in shutdown mode
at the beginning of this year, there
were a lot of hard lessons learned by a
lot of people, and there were a lot of
people who suffered, starting with the
people that needed assistance in one
way or another by Federal employees
who were, in effect, sitting at home
waiting for us to open the government
again.
So, Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased.
Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gen-
tleman, I think that hard lesson—and
we met pretty much every night in the
Rules Committee, the Appropriations
Committee, the gentleman is an appro-
priator—that was something that
weighed heavily on all of us.
Mr. Speaker, I do want to applaud
the Republicans and Democrats, our
leadership, and the White House in
coming up with a compromise.
I know there will be some on my side
that will not support this for a variety
of reasons, and I know there will be
some on Mr. COLE’s side as well, but,
hopefully, we can garner enough sup-
port—and I think it will be strong sup-
port—today for both of these pieces of
legislation that are brought up under
the rule.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my col-
leagues for joining me to speak on the
rule and these pieces of legislation.
The rule provides for consideration of
H.R. 549, the Venezuelan TPS Act,
which we already know is supported by
a bipartisan majority in this House.
We also need and must pass H.R. 3877,
the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019. This
legislation will raise the debt ceiling
for 2 years and increases discretionary
spending caps for fiscal year 2020 and
fiscal year 2021. The deal achieves par-
ity between increases in defense and
nondefense spending and lets the House
and the Senate get back to negotiation
on all of the appropriations bills so
that Congress can fulfill its constitu-
tional duty of funding the government.
As we look ahead to the next several
weeks, which we will spend in our dis-
tricts visiting with constituents and
touring local businesses, I look forward
to sharing with my constituents that
despite our disagreements and every-
thing that they may see on TV, we can
still come together and get things done
on behalf of America.
Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ‘‘yes’’
vote on the rule and the previous ques-
tion.
The material previously referred to
by Mr. COLE is as follows:
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 519
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing:
SEC. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this
resolution, the House shall proceed to the
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R.
336) to make improvements to certain de-
fense and security assistance provisions and
to authorize the appropriation of funds to
Israel, to reauthorize the United States-Jor-
dan Defense Cooperation Act of 2015, and to
halt the wholesale slaughter of the Syrian
people, and for other purposes. All points of
order against consideration of the bill are
waived. The amendment described in section
5 of this resolution shall be considered as
adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be con-
sidered as read. All points of order against
provisions in the bill, as amended, are
waived. The previous question shall be con-
sidered as ordered on the bill, as amended,
and on any further amendment thereto to
final passage without intervening motion ex-
cept: (1) one hour of debate equally divided
and controlled by the Majority Leader and
the Minority Leader or their respective des-
ignees; and (2) one motion to recommit with
or without instructions.
SEC 5. The amendment referred to in Sec-
tion 4 is an amendment to H.R. 336 to add at
the end of the bill the following:
SEC. 406. CLARIFICATION OF DEADLINE FOR RE-
PORT ON ESTABLISHING AN ENTER-
PRISE FUND FOR JORDAN.
For purposes of section 205(a), the term
‘stablishment of the United States Develop-
ment Finance Corporation’ means the end of
the transition period, as defined in section
1461 of the Better Utilization of Investments
Leading to Development Act of 2018 (division
F of Public Law 115–254).
SEC. 407. FORM OF REPORT ON THE COOPERA-
TION OF THE UNITED STATES AND
ISRAEL WITH RESPECT TO COUN-
TERING UNMANNED AERIAL SYS-
TEMS.
The report required under section 123(d)
shall be submitted in unclassified form, but
may include a classified annex.
SEC. 408. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON WITH-
DRAWALS OF UNITED STATES
FORCES FROM SYRIA AND AFGHANI-
STAN.
(a) Findings—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) The foreign terrorist organization al
Qaeda, responsible for the attacks of Sep-
tember 11, 2001, maintains a presence in Af-
ghanistan.
(2) The Islamic State of Iraq and al Sham,
better known by its acronym ISIS, flour-
ished in the chaos unleashed by the civil war
in Syria and at one point controlled exten-
sive territory in Iraq and Syria.
(3) Al Qaeda, ISIS, and their affiliates have
murdered thousands of innocent civilians.
(4) Al Qaeda, ISIS, and their affiliates have
proven resilient and have regrouped when
the United States and its partners have
withdrawn from the fight against them.
(b) Sense of Congress—Congress—
(1) acknowledges that the United States
military and our partners have made signifi-
cant progress in the campaign against al
Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and al
Sham (ISIS), and honors the contributions
and sacrifice of the members of the United
States Armed Forces who have served on the
front lines of this fight;
(2) recognizes the continuing threat to the
homeland and our allies posed by al Qaeda
and ISIS, which maintain an ability to oper-
ate in Syria and Afghanistan;
(3) expresses concern that Iran has sup-
ported the Taliban in Afghanistan and
Hizballah and the Assad regime in Syria, and
has sought to frustrate diplomatic efforts to
resolve conflicts in these two countries;
(4) recognizes the positive role the United
States and its partners have played in Syria
and Afghanistan fighting terrorist groups,
countering Iranian aggression, deterring the
further use of chemical weapons, and pro-
tecting human rights;
(5) warns that a precipitous withdrawal of
United States forces from the ongoing fight
against these groups, without effective,
countervailing efforts to secure gains in
Syria and Afghanistan, could allow terror-
ists to regroup, destabilize critical regions,
and create vacuums that could be filled by
Iran or Russia, to the detriment of United
States interests and those of our allies;
(6) recognizes that al Qaeda and ISIS pose
a global threat, which merits increased
international contributions to the counter-
terrorism, diplomatic, and stabilization ef-
forts underway in Syria and Afghanistan;
(7) recognizes that diplomatic efforts to se-
cure peaceful, negotiated solutions to the
conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan are nec-
essary to long-term stability and counterter-
rorism efforts in the Middle East and South
Asia;
(8) acknowledges the progress made by
Special Representative Khalilzad in his ef-
forts to promote reconciliation in Afghani-
stan;
(9) calls upon the Administration to con-
duct a thorough review of the military and
diplomatic strategies in Syria and Afghani-
stan, including an assessment of the risk
that withdrawal from those countries could
strengthen the power and influence of Russia
and Iran in the Middle East and South Asia
and undermine diplomatic efforts toward ne-
gotiated, peaceful solutions;
(10) requests that the Administration, as
part of this review, solicit the views of
Israel, our regional partners, and other key
troop-contributing nations in the fight
against al Qaeda and ISIS;
(11) reiterates support for international
diplomatic efforts to facilitate peaceful, ne-
gotiated resolutions to the ongoing conflicts
in Syria and Afghanistan on terms that re-
spect the rights of innocent civilians and
deny safe havens to terrorists;
(12) calls upon the Administration to pur-
sue a strategy that sets the conditions for
the long-term defeat of al Qaeda and ISIS, as
well as the protection of regional partners
and allies, while ensuring that Iran cannot
dominate the region or threaten Israel;
(13) encourages close collaboration be-
tween the Executive Branch and the Legisla-
tive Branch to ensure continuing strong, bi-
partisan support for United States military
operations in Syria and Afghanistan; and
(14) calls upon the Administration to cer-
tify that conditions have been met for the
enduring defeat of al Qaeda and ISIS before
initiating any significant withdrawal of
United States forces from Syria or Afghani-
stan.
(c) Rule of Construction—Nothing in this
section shall be construed as a declaration of
war or an authorization of the use of mili-
tary force.
SEC. 6. Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not
apply to the consideration of H.R. 336.
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time, and
I move the previous question on the
resolution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on ordering the previous
question.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this question will be post-
poned.

CONGRESSIONAL BASEBALL GAME
RAISES WELL OVER $1 MILLION
FOR CHARITY
(Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Penn-
sylvania asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute
and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, we didn’t want to
let the August recess go by without
giving our annual report on the Con-
gressional Baseball Game for Charity. I
know you have been waiting for this
moment, Mr. Speaker.
Once again, over 20,000 people came
to Nationals Park to watch an exciting
game of baseball between the Demo-
crats and the Republicans. It was a
rowdy crowd at Nationals Park. It was
an exciting, action-packed game.
I am happy to report to the House of
Representatives that, once again, the
Democrats won the game 14–7.
I want to commend the Republican
team. They played a very competitive
game. They have got some new players.
They are playing with a lot more re-
solve, and we look forward to competi-
tive matches with them in the future.
Our MVP this year was CEDRIC RICH-
MOND, who pitched a complete game,
and we had a record number of fresh-
man Members playing on the team this
year. In addition, we had two out-
standing women on the team, LINDA
SÁNCHEZ and NANETTE BARRAGÁN, who
added much to the team.
So, in the end, Mr. Speaker, the real
winners of this game are the charities.
The game this year raised a little shy
of $1.3 million for the charities. So it
was a good cause and good camara-
derie.
I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, that
those of us on the Democratic team
genuinely like our colleagues on the
Republican baseball team. We get
along great together. We have a lot of
fun. We practice hard, and we play our
hearts out to give the crowd a good
game and raise money for the charity.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS), the Repub-
lican manager.
Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
MICHAEL F. DOYLE), and I just want to
congratulate the Democrats for a hard
victory.
Mr. Speaker, the gentleman used
some words over there that I didn’t un-
derstand when he said ‘‘generally’’ and
some other things, but we will talk
about that later. But I congratulate
them for their victory.
I also want to congratulate our play-
ers for the Republican team. From
March 1 to game day, from 6 to 7:30,
they played and practiced, and I thank
the gentleman for their involvement.
I also congratulate the gentleman
from the great State of Florida (Mr.
STEUBE), who was our most valuable
player. Mr. Speaker, I asked him to
throw strikes, and he threw strikes and
did a great job for us.
Mr. Speaker, I also want to just re-
mind everybody, this is a bipartisan
event—it truly is—and for at least a
moment, we come together to share
the love of this country and the love of
the great game of baseball. I want to
thank everybody for participating.
The charities were mentioned; the
largest amount raised for the charities
since we have been playing this ball
game, and that is the most important
thing.
And, also, I want to say to my play-
ers, who I dearly love, we come back, I
think, September 3. At 6 will be our
first practice, September 3, to begin
the journey to victory next year over
the Democrats.
I just close with a quote from the
great Satchel Paige, a great Hall of
Fame pitcher, who won two games of a
doubleheader in 1948. When asked what
his best pitch was, was it his curve ball
or his fastball, he told the press it was
neither. ‘‘It was my ‘be’ ball.’’
The press said: ‘‘What is your ‘be’
ball?’’
He said: ‘‘When I throw it, it goes
where I want it to be.’’
And where we want to be next year is
right over there holding that trophy,
beating the Democrats.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material into the
RECORD on H.R. 3877.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Kentucky?
There was no objection.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, today, we have an op-
portunity to advance bipartisan legis-
lation that will help secure a stronger
future for American families and our
Nation’s economy.
The 2-year budget caps deal we are
now debating raises the debt ceiling
and increases the budget caps for 2020
and 2021. It stops extreme sequestra-
tion cuts of $125 billion from being im-
plemented, helps us avoid another dev-
astating government shutdown, and es-
tablishes a realistic budgetary frame-
work so that we can make critical in-
vestments in our Nation’s people and
prosperity.
This budget agreement represents a
vast improvement over the harmful
cuts contained in the President’s 2020
budget proposal. It rejects the Trump
budget’s 9 percent cut to nondefense
discretionary spending that would have
weakened national and economic secu-
rity, endangered public health, and
crippled critical programs that support
American families.
Instead, this bill will allow us to
make strong investments in everything
from K–12 education and infrastructure
to research and development, clean en-
ergy, and veterans’ healthcare.
This is about finally moving us past
the threat of sequestration. It is about
upholding the full faith and credit of
the United States. And it is about pro-
viding much-needed certainty to our
communities and for our economy.
This bipartisan agreement is a vic-
tory for the American people. In the
most divisive and polarizing environ-
ment in our lifetimes, it is a much-
needed example of Congress coming to-
gether to prioritize the American peo-
ple over self-serving politics.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to fulfill our obligations to
govern and ensure we meet the needs
and priorities of the American people
by passing this bill, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, one of the most funda-
mental duties of Congress is to fund
the government. I am pleased that,
after months of uncertainty, a budget
agreement has been reached, thanks to
the work of the President, his Cabinet,
and the Congress.
This 2-year funding deal ends the
threat of sequestration and continues
to improve our military strength. It
doubles down on our commitment to
serving and protecting the American
people by enhancing the United States’
defense capabilities and ensuring our
courageous troops have the resources
they need to deter, fight, and win.
It wasn’t that long ago, Mr. Speaker,
that our military was in the midst of a
readiness crisis. It would be irrespon-
sible, in my strong opinion, to retreat
back to that point. This deal helps us
prevent that.
The legislation averts a $71 billion
cut to defense that would have taken
place early next year, absent an agree-
ment.
Mr. Speaker, I am a 30-year veteran
of the Arkansas National Guard, one
deployment under my belt. I chair the
Board of Visitors at the United States
Military Academy at West Point, and I
recognize the rise of the threat facing
us around the globe. I also understand
the devastation a sequester would
cause.
It is not something that we can allow
to happen, and I have seen the numbers
floating around about what Congress is
about to do.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7402 July 25, 2019
Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker. The se-
quester numbers that would have
taken place if this Congress didn’t act
were never going to happen. Anybody
who suggests that we were going to cut
$71 billion from national defense is not
being intellectually honest. We were
not going to allow that to happen.
Mr. Speaker, this bill also takes the
chaos that would ensue following an-
other government shutdown off the
table. Nobody in this room likes con-
tinuing resolutions or big omnibus
packages. We take those off the table.
Now, I will be honest. This is not a
perfect deal. It is not the bill I would
have written if I were just a Congress
of one. No compromise in any serious
negotiation where there are two com-
peting sides will ever result in a perfect
outcome. But it does allow us to move
forward with a measure of stability for
our economy.
Again, I highlight that these negotia-
tions brought forward an important
agreement in which there will be no
poison pills in the funding bills for this
year or next and a concerted effort to
strive toward no shutdowns and no
large omnibus packages.
Any compromise involves hard
choices. I don’t know of a committee in
the Congress, in the House of Rep-
resentatives, that has to make more
hard choices than the people who gath-
er around that Committee on Appro-
priations markup room.
For our distinguished chairwoman,
NITA LOWEY, and all of my fellow ap-
propriators who have a lot of requests,
there are never enough resources to
meet all of them, but we have to make
some very hard choices.
Then, let’s not forget the real and
practical impact of our current debt
and the deficits that add to that debt.
We need to put America back on a re-
sponsible fiscal path. While I support
the progress we have made in this bill,
I feel strongly that Congress must ad-
dress the looming crisis of our debt for
our children and our grandchildren.
But here is an inconvenient truth:
Total discretionary spending, when I
came to Congress, was almost $1.3 tril-
lion. That was what we spent on the
discretionary budget of the U.S. Gov-
ernment. That is the part of govern-
ment that most people identify with.
Next year, under this caps agreement,
discretionary spending is going to be
just under $1.4 trillion. That is not
much of an increase over a 10-year pe-
riod.
To put it in perspective, discre-
tionary spending was 9 percent of GDP
when I came to Congress. It is down to
6 percent now.
If you look at the CBO report that we
highlighted earlier this year, CBO
says—their words—as a percentage of
the economy, discretionary spending is
going down, and mandatory spending
continues to skyrocket.
The year before I came to Congress,
mandatory spending was 61 percent of
the Federal budget. Today, it is about
70 percent of the Federal budget.
Mandatory spending is putting in-
tense pressure on a lot of programs on
the discretionary side that a lot of
America relies on.
I think we have to fix that. I don’t
know what the answer is, but I do
know this, Mr. Speaker. I know one of
the answers is that we have to get back
to regular order.
I can’t say it any clearer. We haven’t
done the budget process that is en-
shrined in the 1974 Budget Act since I
have been in Congress. In fact, most
people in Congress look at how we do
things now—CRs, omnis, shutdowns,
those kinds of things—as normal. It is
anything but normal.
I know my friend, Mr. YARMUTH, and
I worked very hard, as did Mrs. LOWEY,
on the Joint Select Committee on
Budget Process Reform last year. We
got close. We made a few recommenda-
tions. We couldn’t quite meet the
threshold for reporting, but we took a
stab at it. I hope we can elevate that
discussion in the 116th Congress and
have some success doing that.
Today, we are here to vote on a bi-
partisan bill, a bill that has been care-
fully negotiated over weeks with com-
peting interests. The administration
has been involved, with Mr. Mnuchin
representing the President, and the
four corners of leadership. Not the
most ideal way to come up with an an-
swer or a solution, but it is what we
have today.
Mr. Speaker, with all the things that
we have in front of us, let’s take the
chaos off the table, and let’s pass this
deal. Then, maybe—maybe—we can ele-
vate the conversation to talk about the
real drivers of the deficit and the debt
in this country when we come back and
as we move into the remainder of this
year.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I am
honored to yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Mrs.
LOWEY), the chair of the Appropria-
tions Committee.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
support of H.R. 3877.
For months, House Democrats have
insisted on raising unworkable budget
caps so Congress can responsibly fund
our government and uphold our com-
mitments to American families.
Unless Congress and the President
act, the United States will face $125 bil-
lion in devastating cuts that will hurt
American families and weaken our na-
tional security.
That is why this bipartisan legisla-
tion to avoid this fiscal cliff is so crit-
ical. It thoroughly rejects the Presi-
dent’s slash-and-burn budget proposal,
which would have pulled the rug out
from under families and communities
by decimating initiatives and services
that make a real difference in people’s
lives.
Instead of reckless cuts, Democrats
were successful in securing the largest-
ever increase in base funding above se-
questration levels. With these more
reasonable budget caps, we can under-
take an orderly appropriations process
to invest in critical domestic priorities
for the people.
While this bipartisan deal represents
a compromise, I am proud that it ends
the senseless austerity of the Budget
Control Act once and for all.
I urge support for this legislation, so
that we can help give every American a
better chance at a better life.
b 1415
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. SCALISE), the distinguished
Republican whip.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I want to
associate myself with the remarks
made by my friend, the gentleman
from Arkansas (Mr. WOMACK) who
talked about the importance of what
we need to do to get back into a posi-
tion where we can get control over
spending.
There are people that are running
around right now trying to pit our Na-
tion’s defense against balancing the
Federal budget
Mr. Speaker, in fact, it is a false
choice because if you zeroed out the en-
tire Department of Defense’s budget,
which I hope no one would embrace, if
you zeroed it out, you would still have
a deficit. So, clearly, it is not the De-
partment of Defense that is the prob-
lem. We need a strong national defense.
President Trump has been rebuilding
our military. We need to keep rebuild-
ing our military.
Mr. Speaker, we had more men and
women die in training exercises than
dying in combat over the last 3 years,
by a 5-to-1 margin. It was less safe to
train to be in the military in the
United States of America than it was
to go into combat, because they didn’t
have the tools they needed. Planes
were falling out of the sky because
they didn’t have spare parts.
We have finally started to address
that. The last thing we want to do is go
backward on that success. And I don’t
think anybody in this building, voting
‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no,’’ understands or would
agree with the idea that if a ‘‘no’’ vote
were to be successful, we would have a
$71 billion cut to our Nation’s defense,
which is one of our prime constitu-
tional responsibilities.
So we have got to get back to solving
the real problems with deficits; and we
all know where that is coming from,
the mandatory side.
We had a bill just in the last Con-
gress that would have cut over $800 bil-
lion, while improving the healthcare of
the people of our country. And if there
are better ways to go and fix these bro-
ken programs, then please put those on
the table. But we need to go back to
that.
But in this bill, not only does it
allow the President to keep rebuilding
our military, it actually protects the
pro-life gains that we have made. We
have made incredible gains to protect
innocent life.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7403
July 25, 2019
That is why groups like National
Right to Life have said such strong
things about why this is so important;
why President Trump needs this bill so
that he can rebuild our military, and
keep building wall and border security,
which is so important. We have to se-
cure our border. This bill includes the
ability for the President to do that as
well.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts (Mr. MOULTON), the vice
chair of the Budget Committee.
Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, this
agreement is a good step forward; not a
great step, but a good step.
As vice chairman of the Budget Com-
mittee, and a veteran who serves on
the Armed Services Committee, I want
to speak for a moment about its im-
pact on our national security.
This bill turns our attention to con-
fronting and out-competing our adver-
saries. And partly, it does so by ending
the threat of sequestration.
Now, we all know that the Budget
Control Act was established with the
tool of sequestration in an effort to im-
prove our budgeting process to, in fact,
address our debt, which itself is a
threat to our national security. But we
also know that that hasn’t worked.
And in the meantime, our national se-
curity, our defense budgeting is at risk.
This bill not only ends that; it also
creates parity in increased defense in-
vestments with domestic investments.
That is a big deal, because it means we
will spend as much on the dignity of
Americans as we will on their defense.
But it is also important to note that
a lot of defense functions, a lot of
things that ensure our national secu-
rity fall under nondefense discre-
tionary spending; things like investing
in veterans’ healthcare, investing in
embassy security. In fact, the entire
investment we make in the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security falls under
nondefense discretionary spending, and
we increase that significantly with this
deal.
But let’s not kid ourselves. This deal
is not perfect. America is racking up a
huge credit card bill which our kids
will have to pay. It has skyrocketed
under this President and his massive
tax cut for the wealthiest few, and this
bill does not address that.
And while I don’t love that this bill
was negotiated behind closed doors, it
proves there is middle ground, and it
strips Congress of those draconian
tools in the Budget Control Act that
made that middle ground hard to find.
Chairman YARMUTH and his team
have done us a tremendous service.
This deal buys us the time and the op-
portunity to fix the budgeting process,
and I hope we will use it.
In the window this creates, where we
aren’t negotiating under gunpoint,
let’s fix Congress and create a next-
generation budgeting process where
there is thoughtful debate and, ulti-
mately, consensus around a fiscally re-
sponsible bill. We can get there. We can
start today, and we can begin by pass-
ing this bill.
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentlewoman from Fort
Worth, Texas (Ms. GRANGER), the rank-
ing member on the House Appropria-
tions Committee and a former mayor. I
believe mayors have a pretty good idea
of what it takes to get things done
when there are competing interests.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in support of H.R. 3877. I am
proud to support this 2-year budget
agreement, because the alternative,
not having an agreement, is simply not
an option.
I want all Members to understand the
importance of this bill in front of us.
This deal keeps our economy on solid
ground because the United States will
avoid defaulting on our financial obli-
gations. Think of that.
With this agreement, we continue to
invest in rebuilding our Nation’s de-
fense and protecting our strategic in-
terests around the world. The threat of
terrorism continues, and Russian, Chi-
nese, and Iranian aggression is on the
rise. It is critical that our military is
ready to meet and defeat all threats.
Unfortunately, unless we pass this
bill, our military and our veterans
would face arbitrary cuts that would be
harmful to our security and that of our
partners, like Israel and Jordan.
When I was the chairwoman of the
Defense Appropriations Subcommittee,
I worked with the Secretary of Defense
to put together a plan to rebuild our
military. He said it would take 5 years.
We have only appropriated the funds
that were needed for two of those
years. We should continue that. If this
bill does not pass, the impending cuts
will have a devastating impact on our
national security.
Our Constitution explicitly states
that the Congress provides for the com-
mon defense. If we don’t pass this bill,
we have failed to live up to our Con-
stitutional responsibilities, and I am
not willing to do that.
Not only does this budget agreement
stabilize funding for our Nation’s mili-
tary over the next 2 years, it also sets
up a framework to prevent harmful
‘‘poison pill’’ riders from being in-
cluded in must-pass funding bills.
Finally, this agreement sets us on a
path to complete an orderly appropria-
tions process and avoid a costly gov-
ernment shutdown.
Our President should be commended
for negotiating with Congressional
leaders to protect key conservative pri-
orities, from maintaining our position
as the most powerful military in the
world, to protecting the life of the un-
born.
I urge my colleagues to join me in
voting for this bill and sending it to
the President’s desk quickly for a sig-
nature.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield
3 minutes to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. SMITH), the chairman of
the House Armed Services Committee.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Speaker, it is crucially important that
we pass this bill. The most funda-
mental responsibility of government is
to fund the government and operate.
And as simple as that may sound, over
the course of the last 8 years, we have
repeatedly failed to do that.
We have had several government
shutdowns, countless other threatened
government shutdowns, continuing res-
olutions, and a steady failure to even
come close to meeting the October 1st
deadline for funding the discretionary
portion of the government; and that
has had a devastating impact.
Certainly, we have heard on a num-
ber of occasions about the impact it
has had on our national security. The
Department of Defense has not been
able to plan its budget for too many
years. It has led to inconsistency and,
as we have heard, it has led to a readi-
ness crisis.
But this applies also to the non-
defense discretionary portion of the
budget; to infrastructure, and
healthcare, and education, and hous-
ing. All of those items have been under
uncertainty for too long over the
course of the last 8 years.
This budget agreement, though not
perfect, funds the government and, I
believe, responsibly funds the govern-
ment, both defense and nondefense.
I really want to commend both Sec-
retary Mnuchin and Speaker PELOSI for
coming together and negotiating this
agreement. There is no secret that we
have big differences between the Demo-
cratically controlled House and the
White House and the Republican-con-
trolled Senate. But despite those dif-
ferences, we have to function. We have
to be able to fund the government and
meet our responsibilities to the Amer-
ican people.
They were able to transcend those
differences, get this deal done, and fund
the government in a responsible way.
Now, it is absolutely true that the
debt and the deficit are still a problem.
I know there are many people out there
who say that it is not. I just don’t see
how those numbers add up. You cannot
continually spend more money than
you take in before it becomes a prob-
lem. We need to responsibly address
that issue.
I don’t think it was responsible to
cut taxes by nearly $2 trillion in the
face of that. I certainly also think that
defense has to be part of that conversa-
tion.
The gentleman earlier said, well, you
could zero out the defense budget and
it wouldn’t make any difference. Well,
the defense budget is 17 percent of the
budget. If you are 17 percent of a budg-
et that is massively in debt, you are at
least part of the problem.
I mean, you can take any one piece of
the budget and say, well, that is not
the problem. In fact, that is kind of
what we have been doing. We have been
taking piece by piece and saying, well,
we can’t cut that; we can’t raise that
tax.
Meanwhile, we have been insisting on
a dollar’s worth of government for 80

cents worth of taxes. In the long run,
people will pay the price for that. In
the short term we have to responsibly
fund the government. That is exactly
what this bill does.
Again, I thank the leadership that
brought this to be, and I urge support
and passage of this bill.
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Corona,
California (Mr. CALVERT), who is the
ranking member on the Appropriations
Committee that funds the national de-
fense of this country.
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
support of the Bipartisan Budget Deal
of 2019. Like many of my colleagues,
there are parts of the deal I object to
and parts I strongly support.
As ranking member of the Defense
Appropriations Subcommittee, I would
have preferred a higher top line for de-
fense than $738 billion. However, we
will always choose certainty and on-
time appropriations rather than an-
other destructive CR.
Right now, our military is at an in-
flection point. As our military readi-
ness returns to appropriate operational
levels, we must continue to push for-
ward on modernization efforts that will
continue America’s superiority on
land, sea, air, and space into the next
century.
Just as former Secretary Mattis
woke Americans up to the dire cir-
cumstances of our readiness levels,
Americans are now beginning to under-
stand that our military superiority can
no longer be assumed against near-peer
adversaries such as Russia and China.
Whether it is hypersonics, low-yield
nuclear weapons, artificial intel-
ligence, or the militarization of space,
the gap has closed.
The 2-year budget deal before us
today provides the certainty for our
military to do what they do best, pre-
pare to win the next war in the hopes
that our military might will deter any
would-be competitor from ever starting
that war.
I know many of my conservative
friends are concerned about more def-
icit spending and adding to our $22 tril-
lion debt. I share that concern, but we
need to look at the full budget picture.
Mandatory spending, if you include in-
terest on the debt, now consumes 72
percent of the Federal budget.
National defense actually accounts
for 15.6 percent of the budget. That
leaves only about 12 percent left in the
pie. We cannot balance our budget on
the back of 12 percent nondefense dis-
cretionary spending. The math does
not work.
In fact, since 2010, because of the
BCA, accounting for inflation, we have
reduced nondefense discretionary
spending by 4.65 percent, and we have
reduced defense discretionary by 17.2
percent.
To my friends on the left, we cannot
continue to ignore realities of manda-
tory spending and simply spend more
on the discretionary side with no re-
gard to the future. And the solutions
need not be drastic.
Slowing the rate of growth and mak-
ing commonsense reforms for future
generations would relieve the pressure
and allow us to finally have a plan to
pay down the debt.
The bill before us is not perfect. That
is the nature of compromise. But my
‘‘yes’’ vote is in support of the brave
men and women who wear the uniform.
It is our duty to support them and
their missions.
However, I do not vote blind to our
budget reality, which, if left un-
checked, will consume our entire budg-
et.
I urge my colleagues to support the
bill, end the failed experiment of the
BCA, and commit to true budget re-
form that will address our mounting
debt.
b 1430
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), a distinguished
member of the Appropriations Com-
mittee.
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank
you so very much, Chairman YARMUTH,
for yielding time to speak and rise to
support this 2-year budget caps and
debt ceiling agreement that is before
us and urge all of our colleagues to do
the same.
This agreement is not perfect. Frank-
ly, it is a difficult vote, given the hard
work that our Appropriations Com-
mittee has undertaken to diligently
write, debate, mark up and pass 10 of
our 12 fiscal year 2020 annual spending
bills through this Chamber. The other
two were written and reported out of
committee.
We will have to make hard choices as
we work with the Senate to allocate
these funds among the 12 sub-
committee bills, but as an appropri-
ator, I intimately understand Congress’
top responsibility is to keep the ship of
state running, ensuring an open, fund-
ed, and fully functional government of
the United States.
I also know from experience that the
full faith and credit of our government
can never be questioned. Every one of
our constituents deserves this recogni-
tion from their elected Member, and
this agreement moves Congress past
the devastating threats imposed under
the Budget Control Act of 2011. Thank
goodness.
It avoids deep, automatic cuts that
would devastate government’s ability
to help the American people and meet
our obligations to them, including the
most vulnerable.
This agreement rejects the dev-
astating cuts the President’s fiscal
year 2020 budget proposed and main-
tains significant funding levels for do-
mestic priorities and defense priorities
alike.
Most importantly, this agreement
moves us a step closer to finalizing ap-
propriate allocation of all our Federal
dollars responsibly.
Mr. Speaker, I commend our leader-
ship efforts on both sides of the aisle to
reach a final consensus and bring this
bipartisan agreement to the floor. This
agreement reflects give-and-take from
all sides of Congress and the White
House, and it is deserving of a strong
bipartisan showing of support from this
body.
Let’s govern.
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, on occa-
sion it is important to reach out to the
rural areas of our country for wisdom,
and we are going to reach out to west
Texas, near Clarendon, Texas. I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. THORNBERRY), my friend, the Re-
publican lead on the House Armed
Services Committee.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I
appreciate the gentleman yielding.
As the current occupant of the chair
will remember, on February 6, 2018,
just last year, Secretary of Defense
Mattis testified: ‘‘Let me be clear, as
hard as the last 16 years of war have
been, no enemy in the field has done
more harm to the readiness of the
United States military than the com-
bined impact of the Budget Control
Act’s defense spending caps, worsened
by operating in 10 of the last 11 years
under continuing resolutions of varied
and unpredictable duration.’’
Mr. Speaker, this bill before us now
fixes, finally, the problems that Sec-
retary Mattis pointed to in his testi-
mony last year, for, as members will
recall, starting in 2010, with the re-
sponsibility of both Republicans and
Democrats, both the White House and
Congress, defense spending went down,
in real terms, about 20 percent.
And we are not just talking numbers.
We are talking increased aircraft acci-
dents. We are talking tragic accidents
at sea where sailors were killed. We are
talking in all the services, a number of
training accidents and malfunctions
that had real consequences to the
human beings who volunteer to protect
our country.
Now, the last 2 years—again, on a bi-
partisan basis—we have begun to turn
that around. We have begun to improve
our readiness, begun to improve train-
ing, begun, as the gentleman from Cali-
fornia was talking about, to narrow
some of the gaps that have developed
on key technologies with other adver-
saries. But the job is not done yet. We
have to continue that momentum.
While the underlying bill before us
does not provide for as much defense
spending as I believe we should spend,
the certainty of a 2-year deal having
more money for defense than was origi-
nally in the underlying House budget,
all of those things, to me, say the right
thing to do is to pass this.
I know Members can find some ex-
cuse about what is in the bill they
don’t like or what is not in the bill
that they wish it were. Any sort of leg-
islation that is a result of compromise
between two parties, two Houses of
Congress, two branches of government,
is going to yield that sort of result.
But, Mr. Speaker, we cannot forget
that the first function of government is

to provide for the common defense; and
the Nation and, especially, the men
and women who serve and their fami-
lies depend upon us doing our job under
the Constitution.
Article I, section 8 says it is our job
to raise and support, provide and main-
tain. This bill helps us fulfill that re-
sponsibility, and it should be passed.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the majority leader
of the House of Representatives.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the distinguished chairman, Mr. YAR-
MUTH, the chairman of the Budget
Committee, for yielding.
I thank Mr. WOMACK for his leader-
ship, both as chairman, now as ranking
member on the committee, as we look
to pursue fiscally responsible paths,
but also fiscal paths that will invest,
knowing the national security from the
defense standpoint, but the national se-
curity from the domestic standpoint.
Obviously, if we have a strong de-
fense but our education system is
wanting, our economic system is want-
ing, our healthcare system is wanting,
we will have a national security prob-
lem.
Mr. Speaker, I rise, therefore, in sup-
port of this bipartisan legislation,
which formalizes the agreement
reached earlier this week by Speaker
PELOSI and Secretary Mnuchin on be-
half of the President. It has the sup-
port of Senators SCHUMER, MCCON-
NELL—the Republican leader—and the
House Republican leader, Mr. MCCAR-
THY.
This is what we have been working
toward for a very long time, and I am
pleased that we are able to secure an
agreement before the end of the July
work period. This will provide cer-
tainty for the American people by pro-
viding the top-line guidance necessary
for appropriators and the full House
and Senate to complete work on fund-
ing the government for fiscal year 2020.
Ideally, we would do that before Sep-
tember 30 of the coming months.
But this agreement was made pos-
sible by virtue of, in my view, the fact
that we passed 10 appropriations bills
to fund 96 percent of the government
before the end of June. That hasn’t
been done before.
Now, there have been 10 bills passed
back in 2006, 13 years ago, but it did not
include Labor-Health, so it left out a
very big chunk of government funding.
I am proud of the fact that we did
that, but it also set a mark. It set an
objective. It set, through the chair-
man’s deeming, the numbers that the
appropriators could mark up their
bills, that we could mark them up in
June. It set an expectation of what we
could do and should do.
It was also achievable because Demo-
crats were united in our determination
to deliver our promise to end the con-
stant brinksmanship that character-
ized the last several years and restore
responsible government for the people.
It is also, in my view, a result of the
fact that Secretary Mnuchin wanted to
have a fiscally responsible and
knowable end to the differences be-
tween the two parties, which under-
mined our economic security and un-
dermined the confidence of the Amer-
ican people and the international com-
munity in the financial stability of our
country.
To that end, I am glad that this
agreement also suspends the debt
limit.
Very frankly, Mr. Speaker, we ought
to do away with the debt limit. It is a
phony issue. It bears no relation to re-
ality. It is just a game. It is a political
gimmick, an item of demagoguery for
the Members.
Very frankly, we set a debt limit
when we buy something or we borrow
something. The United States is going
to pay for what it buys, and it is going
to pay back what it borrows. That is
the debt limit.
This phony number that we are now
suspending for a couple of years, I
think that is what we should do. But,
frankly, if it were up to me, I would do
away with the debt limit, not because
I don’t want to see us bring down the
debt, but because I think it bears no re-
lationship to our needs, our challenges,
our opportunities.
Those who would have held hostage
the full faith and credit of the United
States, as some have done in the past
to demand partisan concessions, will be
prevented from throwing the legisla-
tive process into chaos as they have
done.
With the threat of default gone and
the danger of sequester-level budget
cuts removed—and thank goodness, we
will see the end of the sequester,
which, as I said, bore no relationship to
needs and opportunities and respon-
sibilities. With that threat gone, we
can now move forward together to in-
vest in fighting poverty, expanding op-
portunities, strengthening our commu-
nities, and, yes, defending our Nation
and our allies.
I want to thank Chairman YARMUTH,
Chairwoman LOWEY, Chairman NEAL,
and Ranking Member WOMACK, who is
my friend and who I think is a very re-
sponsible, constructive Member of the
Congress of the United States trying to
work toward fiscal responsibility.
Let there be no mistake: We are
going to have to make some tough de-
cisions in the years ahead to make sure
that our fiscal house is in order.
Mr. Speaker, the American people
ought to know we are receiving the
lowest revenue in a very long time, I
don’t know whether in history—prob-
ably not in history—but a very low
level of revenue to the government.
But we are buying a lot of stuff, and we
have got to bring those in balance,
what we are willing to pay for and
what we need to buy, whether it is in
services, either on Social Security or
Medicare or anything else, or on oper-
ating expenses, on an annual basis.
This is an example, Mr. Speaker, of
how we can restore the faith of the
American people in their government—
avoid a shutdown, act responsibly,
reach agreements, create consensus—
by showing them we can be responsible
stewards of the economy, that we can
advance our democratic values and pri-
orities through bipartisan means, and
that we can demonstrate that govern-
ment can work for the people it serves.
I hope we can all come together
today, Mr. Speaker, and approve it,
sending a strong sign of support to en-
courage the Senate to do the same, and
to do so quickly.
I urge the President, as he said today
in a communication to his Repub-
licans, he said House Republicans
should support the 2-year budget agree-
ment, which greatly helps our military
and our vets. I am totally with him.
I am pleased that the President sup-
ports this agreement. I am pleased that
we reached this agreement. I would
hope that we could all vote for this
agreement, not because as, so many
have said, it is perfect, but because it
is the result of honest negotiations and
discussions between rational people
who know that we have a job to do for
America, and we are prepared to do it.
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote.
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
A constant theme on our side has
been that of national security, a reason
why we should support the agreement
that has been hammered out between
the administration and the four cor-
ners of leadership in the House and the
Senate, and I stand by that.
We have had speakers from the House
Armed Services Committee, the House
Appropriations Committee, Defense
Subcommittee and so on, and it is an
important reason because of how much
money it commands of Federal tax-
payer money to actually protect, se-
cure, and defend the United States of
America.
But, Mr. Speaker, one of the discus-
sions, one of the debates we are not
having is about the true drivers of the
deficit and the debt, and that is a con-
versation that I would like to intro-
duce in these proceedings today. I
brought a chart with me.
As I was preparing my remarks
today, I got to thinking: What were the
numbers back in 2010 when I first
sought office in the House of Rep-
resentatives versus what we are talk-
ing about today?
So we have a snapshot in time of 2010
and a snapshot in time of what we are
debating today. Mr. Speaker, I direct
your attention to this chart because, in
2010, discretionary spending, which is
the spending that most of us kind of re-
late to the Federal Government, every-
thing from keeping the lights on at
this Capitol to paying for the men and
women who are downrange defending
our freedoms, was a little over $1.2 tril-
lion in 2010.

The number that we are debating
today and that others have been crit-
ical of is just under $1.4 trillion. It is

$1.37 trillion. It represents an increase
of $114 billion in 10 years. Most people
would probably say that, given 10
years—we had a couple of years there
where we had trouble with our econ-
omy—a percentage increase like that
might be within reason.
Now, Mr. Speaker, I want to direct
your attention to the mandatory side
of the spending. It has come up a cou-
ple of times in our discussion today,
the true driver of the deficit and the
debt.
When I came to Congress in 2011, the
2016 number was $2.1 trillion. Today,
not part of this discussion, mandatory
spending is just under $3.3 trillion. Mr.
Speaker, that is an increase of almost
$1.2 trillion in 10 years. We are not hav-
ing that discussion today.
I am reminded of the old Bronx-born
bank robber, Willie Sutton, Mr. Speak-
er, who when captured, legend has it,
was asked, ‘‘Why do you rob banks?’’
He said, ‘‘Because that’s where the
money is.’’
If we are going to have a meaningful
discussion, a constructive discussion
about how we put the balance sheet of
the U.S. Government back in order, we
cannot have an intellectually honest
conversation if we are ignoring the bot-
tom line here. In 10 years, mandatory
spending has grown 10 times the rate of
discretionary spending, yet we are not
talking about that today.
Mr. Speaker, I am hoping that when
this is all finished, and we pass this bill
and put our country on a pretty solid
budgetary framework for the next cou-
ple of years, that maybe we can sit
down to talk about the true drivers of
the deficit and the debt.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. PELOSI), the Speaker of
the House of Representatives.
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding, and I thank
him for his great work as the chair of
the Budget Committee. He knows bet-
ter than all of us that our Federal
budget should be a statement of our
national values and that what is im-
portant to us as a Nation should be re-
flected in that budget. I thank Mr.
YARMUTH for his leadership and thank
his staff for bringing this legislation to
the floor.
Mr. Speaker, I also thank Chair-
woman NITA LOWEY, the chair of the
Appropriations Committee, and her
staff for the important work that they
did to help us get to the place we are
today. That place is bipartisan legisla-
tion which reflects an agreement that
is bold, bipartisan, and a victory for
the American people.
I think we all agree, including the
ranking member, that we all want to
reduce the deficit, so let us work in a
bipartisan way. The national debt, let’s
work in a bipartisan way to do that.
While we are at it, we may want to
eliminate the vote on lifting the debt
ceiling each year as well because the
full faith and credit of the United
States of America should never, ever be
in question.
This agreement was reached, and it
will meet the needs of the people whom
we are honored to represent, investing
in middle-class priorities that advance
the health, financial security, and well-
being of the American people, and en-
hancing our national security.
Democrats have achieved priorities
that we set out from the start. Obvi-
ously, we have shared priorities.
We are permanently ending the
threat of sequestration. That is a very
important measure. The administra-
tion has joined us to end the dev-
astating sequestration cuts that
threaten our investments to keep
America number one in the global
economy and, again, ensure our na-
tional security.
We are also limiting offsets to half of
what was originally proposed to those
that were accepted in an earlier bipar-
tisan agreement.
We are taking action to avoid an-
other government shutdown, which is
so harmful to meeting the needs of the
American people and honoring the
work of our important men and women
in our Federal workforce, and also the
collateral damage that a shutdown
does to our economy.
We are securing robust funding for
crucial domestic priorities, as I said.
We have always insisted on parity in
increases between defense and non-
defense. We are pleased that our in-
crease in the nondefense budget actu-
ally exceeds the parity number on de-
fense by $10 billion over the next 2
years.
We are pleased to be able to say that
we have secured an increase of more
than $100 billion in the budget cap for
domestic priorities since the President
took office.
Finally, we are safeguarding the full
faith and credit of the United States of
America by achieving a lifting of the
debt limit until July 31, 2021. Perhaps
between now and then, we can work in
a bipartisan way to address removing
all doubt about whether the debt limit
will be increased.
It is important to note that this is
not about future spending. This is
about paying for what we have invested
in already.
It was essential that we reach agree-
ment before the upcoming August dis-
trict work period because we were in-
formed by the Secretary of the Treas-
ury that we might exhaust the full
faith and credit during the district
work period in August.
We are pleased to have done so with
an agreement that meets the needs of
America’s families and our national se-
curity and achieves so many of our pri-
orities.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong vote for
this bill. As I said, we can avoid the
damage of sequestration and continue
to advance progress for the American
people. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote.
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I might consume.
Mr. Speaker, I want to read from a
book that we are all very familiar
with, the Constitution of the United
States, for just a moment. One of my
concerns about what we are doing
today, though I support the outcome,
is written in Section 8 of Article I of
the Constitution: ‘‘The Congress shall
have power to lay and collect taxes, du-
ties, imposts and excises, to pay the
debts and provide for the common de-
fense and general welfare of the United
States; but all duties, imposts and ex-
cises shall be uniform throughout the
United States.’’
Article I, Section 8, it lays it out
pretty simply that the Congress of the
United States has the power of the
purse.
While I support what we are doing
today because I recognize the impor-
tance of getting chaos and uncertainty
off the table for the reasons already
stated in this debate, I am disappointed
that the agreement was hammered out
by basically four people, four plus one,
the administration and four Members
of the Congress referenced in Article I,
Section 8.
That is our job. The only meaningful
debate that has happened over discre-
tionary spending in this country hap-
pened only in this Chamber during the
debates on appropriations that Mr.
HOYER referred to earlier. We have had
those discussions.
I don’t agree with everything in
those appropriations bills. I never
have. But at least we have had that de-
bate on the floor of the House. They
have not had that debate on the floor
of the Senate.
Here we are today, relying on an
agreement hammered out by leaders of
both parties in both Chambers with a
representative from the administra-
tion. To me, Mr. Speaker, that flies in
the face of what Article I, Section 8
says it should be like.
Again, I hope and pray that, over
time, once we put this issue behind us,
realizing that mandatory spending is
growing at 10 times the rate of discre-
tionary spending, the very fight that
we are having today on this floor,
maybe we can get back to regular
order, do some legitimate budget proc-
ess reform so Members like JOHN YAR-
MUTH and myself can work together
jointly to produce budgets, engage in
debates on the floor of the people’s
House, and arrive at outcomes that
probably we are all going to agree has
stuff in it we like and stuff in it we
don’t like.
That is the way the Framers in-
tended this Chamber to be. I am hope-
ful that we will get there eventually.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), a distin-
guished member of the Budget Com-
mittee.
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to revise and extend
her remarks.)

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7407
July 25, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Arkansas
(Mr. WOMACK) for his hand of concilia-
tion, his reconciliation, and to ac-
knowledge the work that he and the
chairman of the Budget Committee
have done and the tone in which the
Budget Committee has conducted itself
in 2019.
Let me, as the gentleman referred to
Article I, Section 8, take note of the
fact that it is a recognition of the
power to lay and collect taxes and du-
ties, to borrow money and regulate
commerce, but in particular, I believe
that there is an underlying responsi-
bility that when we do lay taxes on the
American people, or we cut taxes and
give 1 percent of the population an
enormous gift of paying no taxes, that
we then have a responsibility to try to
respond to the Americans who work
every day and pay taxes and are won-
dering, ‘‘What is our government
doing?’’ This budget is answering the
question.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to join the
gentleman and repeal the Trump tax
cuts, as it burdens working Americans,
as it denies nonprofits the ability to
have deductions when gifts are given to
them, but we are where we are today.
This bipartisan budget resolution,
which I am grateful to have a combina-
tion of leadership and others, elimi-
nates the risk of another costly and
devastating government shutdown.
There were government workers on
food stamps who could not get to work.
It lifts the sequestration caps im-
posed under the Budget Control Act of
2011 to provide for increased invest-
ments in nondefense discretionary pro-
grams needed to keep America com-
petitive.
I was in the midst of those discus-
sions, as many of us were. They were
devastating. They were cutting the
needs of Americans.
We avoid default on the national
debt.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield
an additional 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Texas.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
am grateful to the gentleman for yield-
ing.
I want to bring to the attention of
the American people what we will be
able to do: public health and disease
control, highways, waterway mainte-
nance, hazardous waste.
I came from a community where Hur-
ricane Harvey dumped 51 trillion gal-
lons of water. We need infrastructure.
The Army Corps of Engineers, Fed-
eral courts, FBI, childcare, disaster as-
sistance, economic development, all of
that will now come about.
At the same time, we will ensure
that the United States military will be
strong.
We will not be competing against
each other. By the time we get
through, we are avoiding an 11 percent
cut to defense and a 9 percent cut to
nondefense discretionary. We are mak-
ing people whole.
As it relates to what the Budget
Committee has done, we have had hear-
ings on healthcare, climate change,
education, Medicare, Social Security.
We have been doing work in the Budget
Committee on issues that are impor-
tant, but we are seeking parity.
We are helping with domestic prior-
ities. We are saying to the American
people that we are not just taking your
money and giving it to the top 1 per-
cent of Americans. We are now bal-
ancing the budget, or working on the
budget, paying down on the debt, and
ensuring that we do not default on
America’s debt.
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be
able to support this bill to help Amer-
ica.
Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Budget
Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R.
3877, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019.’’
I support this agreement because it:
1. eliminates the risk of another costly and
devastating government shutdown;
2. lifts the sequestration caps imposed
under the Budget Control Act of 2011 to pro-
vide for increased investments in non-defense
discretionary (NDD) programs needed to keep
America strong and competitive; and
3. avoids default on the national debt and
preserves America’s standing as the world’s
most creditworthy nation.
I thank my Chairman YARMUTH of the Budg-
et Committee and Chairman NEAL of the Ways
and Means Committee, and the bipartisan and
bicameral leadership of the Congress for their
work in reaching this agreement and shep-
herding this legislation to the floor.
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support lifting the
caps imposed by the Budget Control Act of
2011 and ending the awful policy of seques-
tration.
That is why I strongly supported the H.R.
2021, the ‘‘Investing For The People Act,’’
when it was marked up by the Budget Com-
mittee earlier this year.
Mr. Speaker, without Congressional action,
statutory caps on discretionary funding will
force an 11 percent cut to defense and a 9
percent cut, about $55 billion, to nondefense
discretionary (NDD) programs for 2020 relative
to the amounts provided for 2019.
The Balanced Budget Agreement of 2019
replaces these destructive cuts with a realistic
budgetary framework so that Congress,
through its annual appropriations bills, can
make critical investments in our nation’s infra-
structure and people.
As we learned and documented in several
Budget Committee hearings convened by
Chairman YARMUTH, such deep cuts would
have a devastating effect on U.S. national se-
curity and economic vitality.
Failure to lift the budget caps and leaves
agencies that respond to public health threats
and emergencies vulnerable to harmful cuts.
The National Institutes of Health and the
Centers for Disease Control, along with the
State Department and U.S. Agency for Inter-
national Development, play unique roles in
preparing for and responding to threats do-
mestically and abroad.
At a time when there are numerous chal-
lenges—from outbreaks of Ebola and Zika, to
the Flint water crisis, to chronic diseases like
Alzheimer’s and cancer, to the opioid epi-
demic—it is clear we cannot neglect these in-
vestments.
Climate change threatens crop yields, infra-
structure, water and energy supplies, and
human health.
Climate change poses risks to federal prop-
erty and resources, increases potential outlays
from flood and crop insurance, and creates
looming disaster assistance needs.
Under sequestration, agencies dealing with
this threat would be dramatically underfunded
and deprived of the resources needed to re-
spond to this national and global challenge.
According to military experts, diplomacy and
foreign aid are critical components of our na-
tional security.
Both Trump’s own former Secretary of De-
fense, James Mattis, and former Secretary of
Defense Robert Gates have stressed the im-
portance of diplomacy and foreign aid:
‘‘If you don’t fully fund the State Depart-
ment, then I need to buy more ammuni-
tion.’’—then Commander of U.S. Central
Command, General James Mattis, 2013
‘‘. . . based on my experience serving seven
presidents, as a former director of C.I.A. and
now as secretary of defense, I am here to
make the case for strengthening our capac-
ity to use ‘soft power’ and for better inte-
grating it with ‘hard power.’ ’’—Secretary of
Defense Robert Gates, 2007
Inadequate nondefense funding levels lead
to State and Foreign Operations appropria-
tions bills that:
1. slash embassy security funding by more
than 21 percent; and
2. decrease assistance to multilateral orga-
nizations, including our UN contributions, sig-
naling to the rest of the world that the U.S. no
longer keeps its word.
Mr. Speaker, the sequestration regime cre-
ated by the Budget Control Act of 2011 is an
untenable state of affairs and must be cor-
rected.
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 is an im-
portant step in the right direction and rep-
resents a vast improvement over the harmful
cuts contained in the President’s 2020 budget,
restores certainty to our budgeting and
achieves the important priorities of the Amer-
ican people, including:
1. Permanently ends the threat of the se-
quester and preventing devastating funding
cuts of 14 percent to defense spending and 13
percent to non-defense spending, and re-
places years of reckless austerity budgeting
with responsible budgeting;
2. Achieving parity between defense and
non-defense discretionary spending; in fact,
the increase in the non-defense budget au-
thority that exceeds the defense number by
$10 billion.
3. Securing robust funding for critical do-
mestic priorities, including an additional $2.5
billion for a fair, accurate and timely Census;
robust funding for veterans, Child Care Devel-
opment Block Grants, and a strong increase in
the National Institutes of Health budget to ac-
celerate life-saving cancer and health re-
search.
Mr. Speaker, for nearly 75 years, since the
end of World War II, the world has been im-
pressed by examples of American power.
But what has inspired people the world over
is the power of America’s example.
To defend America and keep her great and
strong, we need to pass the Bipartisan Budget
Act of 2019, which ends sequestration and lifts

the budget caps and enable the Congress to
invest in America and her people and restore
their faith in their government.
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCARTHY), the distin-
guished Republican leader of the
United States House of Representa-
tives; my friend and colleague from Ba-
kersfield, California; and a man that I
know has a great desire to see regular
order played out on the floor of this
House and an opportunity to go back to
the budget process and appropriations
process that we once knew in this great
Chamber.
b 1500
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the Republican leader of the
Budget Committee for yielding. I also
thank him for his work and his desire
to see a budget in this Congress.
I wish we had a budget in this Con-
gress; then we would probably be in a
little stronger position. But we work in
a government that is designed to have
compromise, a divided government.
What we are talking about today is a
compromise. It is not perfect by any
means, but it secures important policy
victories that no conservative can, or
should, dismiss.
Consider these priorities in the final
deal:
The Hyde amendment, perhaps the
most important Federal protection for
Americans’ rights of conscience, can-
not be attacked by Democrats’ poison
pills for 2 years. That means taxpayer
money will not be used to fund abor-
tions for the foreseeable future.
Likewise, the Trump administra-
tion’s Protect Life rule, it will be
unimpeded by legislative antics. This
vital rule stops organizations like
Planned Parenthood from using title X
money as their personal piggy bank.
And here we build on what we started
in the last Congress, rebuilding our
military from the devastating cuts dur-
ing sequestration. We watch a world
that is more dangerous.
I just read an article this week that,
in the last 28 months, China has visited
more ports than in the last 28 years. I
read another article where China and
Russia military planes entered South
Korean air, which they have never done
before, where shots actually had to be
fired. You turn the news on, and you
look at the Persian Gulf and where
Iran is going today.
To keep our men and women safe,
you have got to make sure you have an
investment, and that is exactly what
we do. We build on the victory that we
had before as we move forward.
We also make investments into the
future. I am one who believes, and I
know our Republican leader of the
Budget Committee believes, too, that
the greatest threat to America is the
debt. That is why our budget is so im-
portant.
I understand the majority party can
choose whether they want to do a
budget or not. We chose to do budgets
when we were in the majority. I guess
the decision is not this year, so we are
ending up here in a compromise.
Now, I had wished in this com-
promise—but we are sitting in the mi-
nority, so, apparently, my vote does
not count as much—we would want to
offset any of this spending, find the
savings in the waste, fraud, and abuse.
It is not tough to find savings, so we of-
fered more than $500 billion in offsets.
Let that number sink in for one mo-
ment: $500 billion.
Now, these were not draconian off-
sets that would have hurt the Amer-
ican public. I will give you one for an
example.
We could have reduced fraud and re-
fundable tax credits simply by requir-
ing a Social Security number on the
application. That would save $38 billion
itself. That is all we requested.
Now, just two spending cut ideas
alone would double the amount of sav-
ings that we need. But, unfortunately,
in a divided government, and the other
side is in the majority, they decided
not. Their refusal to discuss any long-
term reforms to the programs that are
actually driving the debt causes prob-
lems.
Now, as the gentleman knows, who is
the leading Republican of the Budget
Committee, when the Republicans took
the majority in 2011 and we had to hand
the gavel back—discretionary spending
is what this body actually has the most
control over, those 12 appropriations
bills. When I had to hand the gavel
back to the current Speaker, NANCY
PELOSI, we were actually spending less
than when she handed the gavel, in
2011, to John Boehner. That is a record
I am proud of.
But the real driver of our debt is
something that, in our majority, we
tried to do something about. We passed
it, but, unfortunately, it failed in the
Senate. We still have that same desire.
When we were in the majority, we
passed a budget that actually balanced.
I know the first part was passing a
budget. The law is actually to balance
what we put forth. We said to the
American public we were serious about
this.
When I look today, this gives us sta-
bility for the next 2 years. This helps
build the military, and it gives the pro-
tections for those that the Republicans
would care most about that are sitting
in law today.
So, no, it is not the bill I would write
by myself—it is a compromise as we
move forward—but it actually allows
this process to work.
For too long, the American public
has watched a continuing resolution,
after a shutdown, after a continuing
resolution. One of the biggest goals
that we had being in the majority was
actually to get the appropriations
process working again, and we did. We
are proud of the fact of moving that
forward.
If I were to look at the appropria-
tions process on the Democratic side,
what they started to write without
having a budget first and without hav-
ing an agreement first, I knew those
bills would never become law. It was a
lot of time wasted. But if I looked at
those bills, what passed on the floor,
and look at what is in this compromise
deal, it is spending less money.
So did we succeed on turning it back
some? Yes, we did, but not enough.
Today is a movement forward, but we
have much more work to do, and given
the opportunity, if our friend, who is
the lead Republican of the Budget
Committee, became the chair, I know
we would have a budget; I know we
would have an appropriations process;
and I know that budget would be bal-
anced. But until that day comes, we
will continue to watch to make sure we
spend less, we build our military, and
we make tomorrow better than today.
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, may I
inquire as to how much time I have re-
maining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Arkansas has 31⁄2 minutes
remaining.
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, it is not the most ideal
situation to be in. As I reflect back on
the many days I spent in my district—
and I am about to go back there for the
August recess, and I am going to cir-
culate around my district and have
some townhall meetings and engage in
conversation. I know this subject is
going to come up.
I already know that most people are
going to say: Look, you guys have a
spending problem up there in Wash-
ington. I hear that a lot, and I would
agree with that. Very few people say
that we have a revenue problem, but
we do have a spending problem.
Mr. Speaker, you can bet your bot-
tom dollar that I am going to be car-
rying this chart with me that I brought
up earlier that shows the big difference
between the mandatory side of Federal
spending and what we are discussing
here today about a $1.37 trillion discre-
tionary budget.
For all of the reasons that have been
mentioned today by my colleagues,
namely, national security, the ability
to give our Pentagon certainty over
the next 2 years as we continue to re-
build the readiness of the men and
women who, on a voluntary basis,
might I add, put their hand up and say,
‘‘I will go anywhere, anytime, to de-
fend the principles of freedom’’—they
make that pledge willingly. They are
not conscripted into the service. They
make it on a voluntary basis.
The least that we should be able to
do is to make sure that the resources
are there that properly man the force,
train the force, and equip the force so
that we never, ever face a fight that is
fair. We should always have the advan-
tage.
So, for these reasons, Mr. Speaker,
and with kind of a measure of hope
that going through this process, as we
have today, maybe it will inspire both
sides of the aisle here and at the other

the House and the Senate, collectively,
doing the work that is prescribed as
our fundamental duty in Article I, Sec-
tion 8 of the United States Constitu-
tion, Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ‘‘yes’’
vote on this bill.
Let’s put this issue behind us. Let’s
move on to the more important things
of our country, to include deficits and
debt and the drivers that actually are
making the situation much worse.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, I think anyone watch-
ing this debate today, and certainly
those of us who are here in the House,
would say this is a very unusual mo-
ment.
We have a lot of debates in this body
in which there is a great deal of una-
nimity and agreement, and usually
that is over naming a post office or
doing something that is totally non-
controversial. But today is very dif-
ferent, because today we have truly, I
think, respected the highest legacies of
this body, that this body is supposed to
be a Chamber where you bring very di-
verse opinions and perspectives to try
and find common solutions to this
country’s needs.
I think the compromise that we are
hopefully going to approve today will
serve as a model for what is possible in
this body and in this Congress, because
it truly is, in my 13 years, I think, a
watershed moment. We are in a very,
very divisive, polarized environment.
We have come together to move this
country forward.
I want to thank and commend the
ranking member and my friend, Mr.
WOMACK. I can’t imagine having a bet-
ter relationship than I have with the
ranking member, and I hope that he
feels that, when he was chairman and I
was ranking member, it was exactly
the same way. Mr. WOMACK is a total
class act and a distinguished Member,
and it is an honor to work with him.
Mr. WOMACK. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. YARMUTH. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Arkansas.
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, let me
say, for the record, that the feeling is
mutual. I admire and appreciate the
great relationship that Mr. YARMUTH
and I have.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for those comments.
Mr. Speaker, I also compliment and
thank the Budget Committee staff,
both majority and minority, for the
work done on this very important piece
of legislation.
Mr. Speaker, our country is facing an
infrastructure deficit; we face a skills
and education deficit; and we face a
growing income inequality crisis. A
failure by Congress to make the nec-
essary investments to promote growth
and opportunity will leave our commu-
nities and country vulnerable.
Instead of the extreme cuts outlined
in the President’s 2020 budget proposal,
we need to be making bold investments
in research and development, edu-
cating and training a strong workforce,
improving public health, caring for our
veterans, ensuring an accurate 2020
Census, and protecting our homeland.
The United States did not become an
economic powerhouse and world leader
by accident. Throughout our history,
we made strong investments in our
people, our economy, and our security
that have allowed us to innovate and
grow, while promoting broad-based eco-
nomic opportunity.
This agreement will build on that
legacy by raising the caps and lifting
the debt ceiling, allowing Congress to
move our Nation forward without leav-
ing our communities behind.
I look forward to passing this bill in
the House, and I encourage both the
Senate and the White House to join us
in ensuring that we meet our obliga-
tions to our Nation and to the Amer-
ican people.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

H7410 July 25, 2019
by the chair and ranking minority
member of the Committee on the Judi-
ciary.
The gentlewoman from California
(Ms. LOFGREN) and the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. COLLINS) each will control
15 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and insert extra-
neous materials on H.R. 549.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California?
There was no objection.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, this should not be a
partisan issue. Democrats and Repub-
licans in both Houses of Congress sup-
port temporary protected status for
Venezuelans. And, yet, when the Ven-
ezuelan TPS Act of 2019 was brought up
on a suspension vote on Tuesday, it did
not pass because most Republicans
voted against it.
President Trump has repeatedly ex-
pressed alarm about the situation in
Venezuela and support for the people,
but he refuses to exercise his authority
to designate Venezuela for TPS.
Today, we vote again on this to pro-
tect Venezuelans who are already in
the United States, and I do hope my
Republican colleagues will vote in sup-
port of it.
TPS is designed to provide a safe
haven to people who are in the United
States and unable to return to their
home country. Venezuela, once one of
Latin America’s most prosperous coun-
tries, but currently bankrupt, is in the
throes of a political crisis, and it is de-
serving of TPS designation.
Four million Venezuelans are outside
their home country due to violence,
hunger, and fear. Seven million people
inside the country need humanitarian
assistance to stay alive, and one in five
Venezuelans have no access to clean
water. This is exactly the type of hu-
manitarian crisis that TPS was de-
signed to address.
For this reason alone, we should
stand in support of Venezuela TPS.
Just 2 weeks ago, Acting Commissioner
of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
Services, Ken Cuccinelli, informed Sen-
ator DICK DURBIN by letter that the ad-
ministration was ‘‘continuing to mon-
itor the situation’’ instead of desig-
nating Venezuela for TPS.
Even more surprising, the United
States is still deporting Venezuelans,
and in late 2018, DHS deported more
Venezuelans than were resettled over
the previous 5 years.
In other words, the Trump adminis-
tration’s Venezuela policy is incoher-
ent at best, but as Members of Con-
gress, we can act consistently with our
concerns for the people of Venezuela by
supporting this bill.
This bill provides us with the mecha-
nism to offer temporary refuge to Ven-
ezuelans who are already in the U.S.
Designating Venezuela for TPS will not
only ensure the safety and security of
thousands of Venezuelans, it will also
demonstrate our bipartisan support of
a legitimate, Democratic transition in
Venezuela.
I commend my colleagues, DEBBIE
MUCARSEL-POWELL and DARREN SOTO,
for their work and their commitment
to the Venezuelan people, and I urge all
of my colleagues to support the Ven-
ezuela TPS Act of 2019.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Florida
(Mr. SOTO), the sponsor of the bill.
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
chairwoman from California for her
time and her leadership on this issue.
Mr. Speaker, I think that Congress
understands at this point that Ven-
ezuela is in crisis; that its people are in
crisis under the evil fist of a tyrannical
dictator who has stayed in power
through fraudulent elections.
That is why the United States recog-
nized Juan Guaido as interim President
in a bipartisan fashion, from President
Trump and leaders in the Senate, to
leaders in the House, including our
Speaker, NANCY PELOSI.
And that is why we have come to-
gether in a bipartisan fashion to file
and pursue the passage of the Ven-
ezuela TPS Act. It was cointroduced
with bipartisanship in its heart with
Congressman DIAZ-BALART, who has
joined me here today to try to get the
job done and to get everybody to-
gether.
We have been joined by such amazing
leaders like Congresswoman SHALALA—
who we will hear from in a second—
who helped on the Rules Committee; or
with the help of Congresswoman
DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, who
helped to work with leadership; and
DEBBIE MUCARSEL-POWELL, a Congress-
woman who helped us guide it through
the Judiciary Committee, along with
Congresswoman LOFGREN as well.
The administration has said positive
statements about this. Just this past
week, Secretary Pompeo said that this
could happen. And we had Vice Presi-
dent PENCE in Florida saying that we
need to act to help the Venezuelan peo-
ple.
So I think we are going to have a sec-
ond chance. We are going to have a
chance tonight to vote on this again
where we won’t need a two-thirds vote,
but it would say a lot about saying
that the Socialist regime that Maduro
has in Venezuela needs to go, and that
we, as a Congress, stand together as
Democrats and Republicans to con-
demn that; and to allow people who are
here, over 170,000 in Florida, and over 1
million throughout the United States,
to have a second chance.
Mr. Speaker, I really hope the House
can come together and show our very
best tonight with the vote.
According to USCIS, Venezuelans
have become the largest group of asy-
lum seekers applying for refuge in the
U.S. Venezuelans made up one-third of
all asylum claims, ahead of people
from Central America, China, and all
other countries. That is really signifi-
cant considering the humanitarian cri-
sis that all parties have recognized is
at the border right now.
Only Venezuelans already in the
United States who pose no risk to the
safety or security of our country are
eligible for TPS. The program already
contains the most stringent criminal
and public safety bars in all of immi-
gration law, so we make sure that
there are only those who are worthy.
Lastly, temporary protective status
is the current law of the land.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield such time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from Florida
(Mr. DIAZ-BALART).
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I
want to thank the ranking member for
allowing me this time.
I want to start by commending—and
I have done this before—by com-
mending the gentleman from Florida
(Mr. SOTO), for his relentless leadership
on this issue.
He has a tradition of working in a bi-
partisan way. He has a tradition of
working on things that are important
to the people of Florida. This is not
only important to the people of Flor-
ida, but when you talk about Ven-
ezuela, as the gentleman knows, this is
important for the national security in-
terests of the United States.
Now, the gentleman mentioned about
the reality in Venezuela today. The re-
ality of what we have seen because of
this Socialist regime in Venezuela is
what used to be one of the wealthiest
countries in Latin America has now be-
come a place where Venezuelans don’t
have access to, frankly, food and medi-
cine.
Mr. Speaker, the most important
thing is the repression that they are
suffering under day in and day out. The
heroic Venezuelan people are doing ev-
erything they can to recover their free-
dom.
I am proud of what this administra-
tion, the Trump administration, has
done in support, in solidarity with the
Venezuelan people, in support of the
cause of freedom.
But while that is going on, a lot of us
believe that it would be unacceptable
to return Venezuelans to the situation
that the gentleman, my colleague from
Florida (Mr. SOTO), just mentioned,
and what I just mentioned as well. And
that is what this legislation is all
about.
We all know that the real solution,
the permanent real solution for Ven-
ezuela is very simple, and it can be
boiled down to one word: freedom. The
freedom of the Venezuelan people. And
we are working, and the administra-
tion has done an amazing job, again, in

solidarity with the cause of freedom of
the Venezuelan people. But in the
meantime, Venezuelans cannot be re-
turned to that dictatorship that we
have spoken so much about.
So, again, I want to thank the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO). I want
to thank also my south Florida col-
leagues. The gentleman mentioned a
number of them. I see Congresswoman
SHALALA is here, and so many others
who have been working on this. Not
only working on this, but also helping
in the cause of freedom for the Ven-
ezuelan people.
So, again, Mr. Speaker, this is not to
be confused with issues dealing with
immigration, with a lot of controver-
sial issues that are out there. This is to
deal with the specific case of the Ven-
ezuelan people who are struggling
under this repressive Socialist regime.
While that is going on, we should not
turn people back. That is what this bill
does. So I would urge a favorable vote.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I am
honored to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Florida (Ms. SHALALA).
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong support of H.R. 549, the Ven-
ezuelan TPS Act of 2019.
And I thank my distinguished col-
league from south Florida, Congress-
man MARIO DIAZ-BALART, for his com-
ments and for his coaching during my
first year.
Venezuela was once the richest coun-
try in Latin America. Now, the econ-
omy, the health sector, the education
system, and virtually every democratic
institution is in ruins because of the
Socialist policies of the evil Maduro re-
gime.
Venezuela is experiencing the largest
refugee crisis in the history of the
Western Hemisphere. There are tens of
thousands of Venezuelan-born residents
in south Florida—17,000 in my district
alone. My constituents cannot safely
return to a country in chaos.
This is why TPS was created. As the
vote on Tuesday demonstrated, this
Congress is ready to allow Venezuelans
to apply for TPS. TPS has bipartisan
support in the House and in the Senate.
It is time for the Senate to take this
bill up.
TPS is a fundamental component in
our approach to the crisis in Ven-
ezuela, but it will not alone solve the
crisis. The United States and the inter-
national community must continue to
put pressure on the regime to facilitate
a peaceful change in leadership, be-
cause our ultimate goal is to secure a
stable and peaceful transition of power
for the Venezuelan people.
b 1530
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO).
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I also want
to just make a point that the tem-
porary protected status program is the
current law of the land. The program
was created for this exact purpose, to
help people living under dire condi-
tions, like Venezuelans who fear for
their lives. It allows them to stay in
the U.S. until the situation changes in
their home country.
In this broader debate over immigra-
tion and over TPS, let us not sacrifice
the Venezuelan people in the process
but, rather, come together in a bipar-
tisan fashion to show the very best of
this Chamber in the interest of freedom
and liberty, not only to Venezuela, but
across the globe.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I ask the gentlewoman if she has
any more speakers.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I have
one additional speaker on the way.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, may I
ask how much time is remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California has 61⁄2 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from
Georgia has 121⁄2 minutes remaining.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself 2 minutes just to make a couple
of additional comments.
First, Venezuela, which was a per-
fectly happy country, has been trashed
by their government. They are now ex-
periencing a 10 million percent annual
increase in inflation, and 85 percent of
the medicines needed for the major
causes of morbidity in the country are
unavailable in the pharmacies. They
are in terrible shape.
I had occasion to go to the Colom-
bian-Venezuelan border a short time
ago, and I would like to tell you what
I saw.
I saw, first, the skinniest refugees I
have ever seen, people who were com-
ing over for the day to get something
to eat. The Catholic Church had orga-
nized food for people who have no food
and who came across the river just to
get a meal with their children. It was a
tragic situation. To think that we
would send someone who is tempo-
rarily here back to that catastrophe is
really unthinkable.
As Mr. SOTO has mentioned, TPS was
devised precisely for this type of situa-
tion where we have chaos in the native
country of someone who is here tempo-
rarily, and it is unconscionable to send
them back.
So we do know that the ultimate an-
swer in Venezuela is not TPS. It is for
the Venezuelan people to gain control
of their government, to have a func-
tioning democracy, to get rid of the so-
cialist policies that have trashed the
country. But, meanwhile, we do need to
have this protection for the Ven-
ezuelans who are here.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself an additional 30 seconds.
Mr. Speaker, I would note that, with-
out a word of complaint, the Colom-
bians have accommodated 4 million
Venezuelans who have left Venezuela
and gone into Colombia. There has not
been a big turmoil in Colombia about
accepting those refugees while this dis-
aster is going on. Surely, the estimated
300,000 Venezuelans who are in the U.S.
today would not pose a burden. They
are able to support themselves, and we
should not be sending them back to a
terrible fate.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, may I ask how much time is re-
maining, please.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 121⁄2 minutes
remaining. The gentlewoman from
California has 4 minutes remaining.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I am
still waiting.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
I think the interesting thing here,
and I will just say this—I am not ready
to close—but at this point in time, I
think one of the issues that has been
said today, it should be noted that DHS
has actually no mechanism to send
anyone back to Venezuela right now.
The channels for getting people back to
Venezuela are not there, so deportation
is not happening, especially now, be-
cause we have no mechanism to do
that. So that is something later on, the
merits of the bill either way.
I am not wanting to engage in a col-
loquy. I am just trying to see if the
gentlewoman has her speaker here.
Ms. LOFGREN. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I yield to
the gentlewoman from California.
Ms. LOFGREN. No, and I think given
the time and the other bills behind us,
why doesn’t the gentleman close. I will
close, and we will go to a vote.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, reclaiming my time, I oppose this
legislation which designates Venezuela
for TPS status.
Under Federal law, the DHS Sec-
retary may designate a country for
TPS if the country is unable to ade-
quately handle the return of nationals
or circumstances prevent it, which is
actually happening right now in many
ways.
The TPS designation means nation-
als of a designated country inside the
U.S. on the date of designation, legally
or illegally, may apply to stay here and
receive employment authorization.
DHS has estimated that there are
270,000 such Venezuelan nationals cur-
rently in the country, and 123,000 are
here illegally.
Generally, TPS is designated for an
18-month period, and the country may
be redesignated for 18-month incre-
ments. But if the country no longer
meets the conditions for TPS designa-
tion, the Secretary must terminate the
designation.
Despite the fact Congress intended
TPS to be a temporary protection, it
has become permanent and automati-
cally renewed. Contrary to Congress’
intent, some countries have been des-
ignated for TPS for decades.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7412 July 25, 2019
The current administration has fol-
lowed the law and terminated TPS for
certain nations, but, of course, that has
not been left alone. It has been stymied
in the court.
I oppose H.R. 549, but the Venezuelan
people are in a dire situation, and
thanks to the socialist policies of Hugo
Chavez and Nicolas Maduro, I pray for
regime change in Venezuela.
If Congress is, nevertheless, inclined
to statutorily designate Venezuela for
TPS, then we should not ensure re-
newal is automatic. If we do not do
that, we can continue the same broken
TPS designation process. No future ad-
ministration will terminate the des-
ignations, and 25 years from now, Mem-
bers will call for the green cards for
those who are here on TPS.
I must also point out the hypocrisy
of designating a country for temporary
protected status. The majority re-
cently passed legislation to create a
green card path for 417,000 aliens in the
country on a temporary protected sta-
tus, some of which were 20 years for a
volcano—not exactly something that is
permanent.
We also may as well remove the word
‘‘temporary’’ from TPS statute and
hand over the green cards right now.
Mr. Speaker, I oppose H.R. 549, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, I would hope that ev-
eryone will vote for this bill.
It is, unfortunately, the case that the
United States has deported Ven-
ezuelans in late 2018. More Venezuelans
were deported than were resettled.
It is important that, while this coun-
try, Venezuela, is really in meltdown,
we don’t take vulnerable people and
send them back there. That is what
TPS is all about. This bill is simple.
I thank Mr. SOTO, Ms. SHALALA, Ms.
DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, and Ms.
MUCARSEL-POWELL for their efforts,
along with those of many others.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that we support
this bill, and I yield back the balance
of my time.

means—
(A) the Committee on Foreign Relations of
the Senate;
(B) the Committee on Appropriations of
the Senate;
(C) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of
the House of Representatives; and

fied, the term ‘‘Department’’ means the De-

TITLE I—ORGANIZATION AND OPER-
ATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE
SEC. 101. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IMPORTANCE
OF DEPARTMENT OF STATE’S WORK.
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) United States global engagement is key
to a stable and prosperous world;
(2) United States leadership is indispen-
sable in light of the many complex and inter-
connected threats facing the United States
and the world;
(3) diplomacy and development are critical
tools of national power, and full deployment
of these tools is vital to United States na-
tional security;
(4) challenges such as the global refugee
and migration crises, terrorism, historic
famine and food insecurity, and fragile or re-
pressive societies cannot be addressed with-
out sustained and robust United States dip-
lomatic and development leadership;
(5) the United States Government must use
all of the instruments of national security
and foreign policy at its disposal to protect
United States citizens, promote United
States interests and values, and support
global stability and prosperity;
(6) United States security and prosperity
depend on having partners and allies that
share our interests and values, and these
partnerships are nurtured and our shared in-
terests and values are promoted through
United States diplomatic engagement, secu-
rity cooperation, economic statecraft, and
assistance that helps further economic de-
velopment, good governance, including the
rule of law and democratic institutions, and
the development of shared responses to nat-
ural and humanitarian disasters;
(7) as the United States Government agen-
cies primarily charged with conducting di-
plomacy and development, the Department
and the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development (USAID) require sus-
tained and robust funding to carry out this
important work, which is essential to our
ability to project United States leadership
and values and to advance the United States
interests around the world;
(8) the work of the Department and USAID
makes the United States and the world safer
and more prosperous by alleviating global
poverty and hunger, fighting HIV/AIDS and
other infectious diseases, strengthening alli-
ances, expanding educational opportunities
for women and girls, promoting good govern-
ance and democracy, supporting anti-corrup-
tion efforts, driving economic development
and trade, preventing armed conflicts and
humanitarian crises, and creating American
jobs and export opportunities;
(9) the Department and USAID are vital
national security agencies, whose work is
critical to the projection of United States
power and leadership worldwide, and without
which Americans would be less safe, our eco-
nomic power would be diminished, and global
stability and prosperity would suffer;
(10) investing in diplomacy and develop-
ment before conflicts break out saves Amer-
ican lives while also being cost-effective; and
(11) the contributions of personnel working
at the Department and USAID are extraor-
dinarily valuable and allow the United
States to maintain its leadership around the
world.

health and safety of United States citizens
abroad;

lishing a ‘‘training float’’ requiring that a
certain percentage of the Foreign Service

tute should seek to substantially increase its
educational and training offerings to Depart-
ment personnel, including developing new
and innovative educational and training
courses, methods, programs, and opportuni-
ties; and
(4) consistent with existing Department
gift acceptance authority and other applica-
ble laws, the Department and Foreign Serv-
ice Institute should seek and accept funds
and other resources from foundations, not-
for-profit corporations, and other appro-
priate sources to help the Department and
the Institute accomplish the goals specified
in paragraph (3).

TITLE X—BUDGETARY EFFECTS
SEC. 1001. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS.
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the
purpose of complying with the Statutory
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of
the House Budget Committee, provided that
such statement has been submitted prior to
the vote on passage.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
New York (Mr. ENGEL) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each
will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New York.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members have 5
legislative days in which to revise and
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on H.R. 3352.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Let me first of all thank our ranking
member on the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, Mr. MCCAUL of Texas, for work-
ing with me closely to bring this bipar-
tisan piece of legislation forward.
Mr. Speaker, one of our top priorities
on the Foreign Affairs Committee is
making sure that diplomacy is a pillar
of American foreign policy. Diplomacy
is the tool, Mr. Speaker, that we use
around the world to defuse crises, to
prevent conflicts, and to help build
peace, stability, and prosperity. We use
diplomacy, along with development, to
strengthen friendships and to bridge di-
vides.
We invest in these efforts because
they help us project our values around
the world, support democracy, human
rights, and our country’s spirit of com-
passion and generosity. We invest in di-
plomacy and development because they
enhance our security.
Countries in regions that are more
stable and governments that are more
transparent and accountable mean that
we have better partners on the world
stage; they mean fewer places where
conflict may erupt or extremism may
take root.
The violence we can forestall through
diplomacy means one less place where
we may need to put American service-
members in harm’s way. So you would
think, Mr. Speaker, with all the tre-
mendous dividends we see from diplo-
macy and development, that the Con-
gress would make sure that our agen-
cies and our personnel responsible for
this work always have the support and
resources they need and that we are
working constantly to provide the
tools needed to meet 21st century glob-
al challenges. That is why it is so
amazing, Mr. Speaker, that the last
time a State Department authorization
was signed into law was the year 2002.
Just think of all the issues we are
grappling with around the world that
we could not have envisioned 17 years
ago. We are asking the State Depart-
ment to counter terrorist propaganda
on social media. But the last time Con-
gress gave the State Department its
legislative due was 2 years before
Facebook was invented, right around
the time the first smartphones were
coming on the market.
Let me be clear. Our diplomats have
done a great job dealing with the chal-
lenges America faces, and our inability
to get a State Department authoriza-
tion signed into law is not for lack of
trying. The Foreign Affairs Committee
and the House have passed a number of
bills that just did not make it across
the finish line.
With the bill we are considering
today, I hope we are starting a new
trend. It contains a wealth of good pro-
visions. I view it as an important start
in breathing new life into the com-
prehensive, regular authorizing work
Congress should do to support Amer-
ica’s diplomacy and development ef-
forts.
It will help the Department recruit
and retain a diverse workforce so that
our diplomats—our face to the world—
look like the country they are rep-
resenting.
It will enhance our Embassy and in-
formation security to keep these dedi-
cated public servants safe. It author-
izes absolutely essential investments
in Embassy security, construction, and
maintenance.
It will help to streamline the Depart-
ment’s management structure, strip
out duplication, and cut away the
deadwood from outdated reports. This
will make sure the agency is flexible
and nimble in a rapidly changing
world.
It will focus on smart planning and
rigorous evaluation so we know we are
being effective in our diplomatic ef-
forts.
Beyond what is in the bill, Mr.
Speaker, I am especially proud of what
this bill stands for. I have tremendous
respect for our colleagues on the
Armed Services Committee and the
Permanent Select Committee on Intel-
ligence. I salute their work in regu-
larly passing authorizing legislation
for the agencies they oversee.
If we are serious about diplomacy
and development as critical parts of
our foreign policy and essential to our
national security, then there is abso-
lutely no reason that a State Depart-
ment authorization bill should not be
part of Congress’ regular work.
b 1545
Our committee has shown again and
again that we can work together in a
bipartisan way to advance our coun-
try’s security. We pass a lot of legisla-
tion, often small fixes around the edges
to get at a particular challenge.
With an authorization bill, we are
sending a stronger message to our dip-
lomats: As you carry out your critical
and often dangerous work, we are going
to have your backs.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we
are advancing this bill today, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
of the State Department Authorization
Act of 2019, which I was proud to draft
with the gentleman from New York
(Mr. ENGEL), my friend and chairman
of the Committee on Foreign Affairs,
and I thank him for his strong biparti-
sanship.
The last State Department reauthor-
ization was signed into law in 2002.
Imagine that, 2002, 1 year after 9/11.
In the 16 years since that authority
lapsed, we have seen too many tax-
payer dollars wasted on inefficient hir-
ing and procurements, an expanding
bureaucracy, and an outdated IT sys-
tem that left us vulnerable to
cyberattacks from foreign nations,
states, and hackers.
It is the fundamental duty of the
House Committee on Foreign Affairs to
pass an annual authorization bill. This
is necessary to fulfill our constitu-
tional Article I oversight responsibil-
ities and our obligation to be good
stewards of the people’s money.
For these reasons, I am proud of this
bipartisan bill that our committee has
produced. It will address numerous
longstanding difficulties. It will also
fortify the Department and our dip-
lomats with the tools they need to ful-
fill their missions to promote America
overseas and enhance our national se-
curity.
Among other important reforms, the
bill before us will modernize the work-
force, eliminate outdated reports and
special offices, prohibit expensive and
unnecessary construction practices,
impose rigorous monitoring and eval-
uation metrics, save taxpayer dollars,
and reassert, as I mentioned before, our
Article I prerogatives of Congress.
As the United States faces growing
challenges from nation-states around
the world, like Russia, China, Iran, and
North Korea, we need our Secretary
and our diplomats to know that Con-
gress fully supports them, and this bill
does just that.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman
ENGEL, again, and his team for working
with my staff and our members to en-
sure that this is a strongly bipartisan
product; otherwise, it could not pass
the House, Senate, and be signed into
law. The chairman knows that, and I
want to thank him, again, for working
with me on this important legislation
that we really haven’t seen in over a
decade.
This type of collaboration has been a
hallmark of our work in this com-
mittee. I, for one, am very proud of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7435

that work, and I know Chairman
ENGEL is as well.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to
vote in favor of this long overdue bill,
which deserves our unanimous support,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Texas (Mr.
MCCAUL) for his kind words and his
hard work.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms.
SPANBERGER), a valued member of the
House Committee on Foreign Affairs.
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today in support of H.R. 3352, the
Department of State Authorization
Act.
I would like to first take a moment
to thank Chairman ENGEL and Ranking
Member MCCAUL for their leadership
on this authorization, the first in more
than a decade. Truly, we are overdue.
As a former intelligence officer who
has served abroad, I can attest to the
vital contributions of the State De-
partment and its workforce in keeping
our American families safe and secure.
We need to give our diplomatic corps,
civil service officers, and support staff
the tools, resources, and training they
deserve as they protect and uphold U.S.
interests and values around the world.
Among this bill’s strong provisions, I
am proud to see my amendment pass
committee to keep the State Depart-
ment workforce safe from sexual har-
assment and assault.
Additionally, I urge my colleagues to
approve my amendment to approve the
security assistance coordination be-
tween the Department of State and the
Department of Defense. This amend-
ment would help Congress and the
American people better understand
how our military deployments support
our diplomatic priorities.
I encourage my colleagues to support
this important bill and to recognize
and reinforce our appreciation for the
tireless work of our diplomatic and
civil service corps.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Florida
(Mr. YOHO), ranking member of the
Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia,
the Pacific, and Nonproliferation.
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I would like
to thank the gentleman from New
York (Mr. ENGEL), chairman of the
House Committee on Foreign Affairs,
for bringing this bill up, and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), my
good friend and colleague, the lead Re-
publican on the House Committee on
Foreign Affairs.
I can’t tell you how important this
bill is, and I rise today in support of
H.R. 3352, the Department of State Au-
thorization Act of 2019.
You heard how long it has been since
we have passed this. It recently passed
out of the Foreign Affairs Committee
with wide bipartisan support. This is
the hallmark of the Foreign Affairs
Committee, and it shows the good work
that is done and how important this is,
and that is why the Foreign Affairs
Committee is the most important com-
mittee in the House.
This legislation helps support the im-
portant work that the State Depart-
ment does and its diplomats do to pro-
tect our national security.
I have had the honor to travel on
codels that are so important, and I en-
courage Members to do that, because it
strengthens America’s foreign policy,
our engagement, and it leaves a belief
in those other countries that America
is here to be allies.
What I am always amazed at is the
hard work of our State Department
employees; and not reauthorizing a bill
that gives them the ability to work, it
kind of affects their attitude. So this is
a critical bill to be approved at this
time.
Despite the essential need for a fully
functioning, operational Department,
this is the first time in 6 years that
there has been a comprehensive De-
partment of State authorization bill.
It is the duty of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee and the Congress as
a whole to provide our departments
with the necessary tools to advance the
United States’ foreign policy.
Again, I thank Chairman ENGEL and
Ranking Member MCCAUL for including
the language from my bill, H.R. 1677,
which repeals certain foreign affairs re-
porting requirements within the State
Department. This provision will repeal,
again, the unnecessary, redundant re-
quirements that are outdated and no
longer needed.
I would also like to commend my col-
leagues in the House Committee on
Foreign Affairs, the staff for coming
together and supporting a bipartisan
bill that will protect America’s na-
tional security. We must not let par-
tisan divide continue to handicap our
diplomats and their mission.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to support the
passage of this bill.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CONNOLLY).
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the chairman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 3352, the Department of State
Authorization Act of 2019. This legisla-
tion helps put our diplomacy and devel-
opment missions on firm footing by up-
dating long-neglected authorities to re-
flect facts on the ground and strength-
ening the State Department’s oper-
ations and workforce.
Diversity is a unique source of that
strength and for our economy and na-
tional security. We must ensure that
our Federal workforce reflects the
American people it serves. That is why
I am grateful that this bill includes the
bulk of my National Security Diversity
and Inclusion Workforce Act, H.R. 2979,
promoting diversity in Federal na-
tional security offices.
That bill and the authorization bill
before us today require regular report-
ing on demographic data related to
State Department’s workforce and di-
versity efforts and encourages State to
expand recruitment and retention pro-
grams to facilitate a diverse workforce
that looks like America.
I want to thank the chairman, in par-
ticular, and the ranking member for in-
cluding this amendment as part of the
bill to incentivize senior leaders to fos-
ter an inclusive environment and offer
a career advancement program for sen-
ior positions, also encouraging a di-
verse participation.
I have collaborated with Federal em-
ployee groups to promote diversity
within Federal agencies, and I welcome
the opportunity to take a comprehen-
sive approach in this bill.
Mr. Speaker, I was a staff member on
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee for 10 years, and I helped write
the last foreign aid bill, and that was
in 1985. As the ranking member noted,
it has been 17 years since we have
brought a State Department authoriza-
tion bill to full force in the law.
Credit goes to Chairman ENGEL and
Ranking Member MCCAUL and their re-
spective staffs for bringing us to this
point and, frankly, without any kind of
adversity. It was the smoothest mark-
up of a State Department bill I ever re-
call, and my hat is off to them. Mr.
Speaker, they deserve a lot of con-
gratulations. It is a good model for this
bill.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. WRIGHT), a member of the House
Committee on Foreign Affairs.
Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in support of the Department of
State Authorization Act of 2019.
For our government to function as
efficiently and effectively as possible,
it is critical for us to revisit the re-
sources and responsibilities of each de-
partment from time to time. As every-
one has noted, but it is worth repeat-
ing, it has been 17 years since we en-
acted a comprehensive authorization
bill for the State Department.
H.R. 3352, which enjoys broad bipar-
tisan support, will bring our diplomacy
into the future and save valuable tax-
payer dollars by reasserting congres-
sional authority, streamlining pro-
grams, eliminating duplicative report-
ing, and requiring measurements of
programs’ success.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman
ENGEL and lead Republican MCCAUL for
including my bill, the Energy Diplo-
macy Act, in H.R. 3352.
Since 1977, when Congress formally
gave the Secretary of State primary
authority over energy-related foreign
policy, there have been significant
changes in the global energy landscape:
The United States is now the world’s
top producer of petroleum natural gas;
We have also seen increased
weaponization of energy by Russia
against our EU and NATO allies, trans-
forming energy into a critical national
security issue.
This new challenge requires re-
affirmed dedication and focus. The En-
ergy Diplomacy Act does just that by

authorizing an Assistant Secretary of
State for Energy Resources and defin-
ing our energy security and diplomatic
priorities.
This will ensure the State Depart-
ment has adequate personnel to carry
out its mandate and protect and ad-
vance the energy security interests of
the United States, as well as those of
our allies abroad.
Finally, this will advance U.S. en-
ergy exports by instructing our dip-
lomats to work in tandem with U.S.
energy companies operating abroad.
Combating Russia’s maligned influ-
ence in Europe has been at the fore-
front of the House Committee on For-
eign Affairs’ agenda this year, and I
firmly believe pushing back on Russia’s
energy dominance in Europe must be
part of our strategy.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, again,
the gentleman from New York (Mr.
ENGEL), the chair, and the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), the lead Re-
publican, for including the Energy Di-
plomacy Act in this bill, and I urge my
colleagues to support the Department
of State Authorization Act.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume to
close.
I just want to say, as I said at the be-
ginning, how proud I am to work with
Chairman ENGEL, to draft this critical
and overdue authorization bill.
I think it was mentioned previously,
I think this is the most bipartisan
committee on the Hill, and it should
be, because we shouldn’t bring par-
tisanship to this body on issues of im-
portance like this.
I want to thank the staff on the ma-
jority side for working with my staff
on the minority side, and particularly,
I want to thank Grant Mullins on my
staff for his excellent work on this bill.
This doesn’t happen by accident. It
happens by design, and it happens when
the staff can work together because the
chair and the ranking member send a
message, a message of leadership, in a
tone that we want to get this done in a
bipartisan way. And the beauty of that
is, Mr. Speaker, that will give this bill,
this authorization, the first one we
have seen since 2002, the best oppor-
tunity to pass the Senate and be signed
into law.
And, Mr. Speaker, this will be a hall-
mark of this Congress, I believe, when
that fine event happens. It is exercising
our constitutional prerogatives under
Article I and our oversight role on the
House Committee on Foreign Affairs.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume for
purposes of closing.
Mr. Speaker, once again, let me
thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.
MCCAUL), my friend and partner, for
his partnership.
This legislation really does represent
the product of close bipartisan work on
this committee since the start of this
Congress. So I wish to thank the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) and
other members of the committee, both
Democrats and Republicans.
And, again, I hope with this bill’s
passage today, the House is turning
over a new leaf. Mr. Speaker, I am
committed to making sure authorizing
legislation for the State Department is
something we do regularly and is some-
thing that this body considers as a
must pass.
I am proud of our work on this bill. I
want to thank my staff. I want to
thank the staff on the minority side, as
well. I am very proud of all of us work-
ing together as a team.
I urge all Members to support this,
and, again, I thank the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. MCCAUL).

Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my
bill, H.R. 3670, the Short-Term Deten-
tion Standards Act.
This legislation is very simple. It re-
quires humane conditions for migrants
detained in short-term detention facili-
ties at our ports of entry.
This legislation is premised on a very
simple idea that defending our coun-
try’s security and upholding humani-
tarian standards are not mutually ex-
clusive. Anyone who believes that we
can have only one or the other mis-
understands America’s core values.
Under current law, the Homeland Se-
curity Act of 2002 only requires that
migrants in short-term detention have
‘‘adequate access to food and water.’’
But we know from the heart-wrenching
images that we have seen on TV and in
news reports, and the findings of the
Department of Homeland Security’s
own inspector general, that, too often,
migrants are going without basic ne-
cessities.
In the last 2 months alone, the DHS
inspector general released two manage-
ment alerts, detailing poor conditions

and extreme overcrowding in El Paso
and in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas,
where I just visited.
That is why I have introduced this
bill, which expands the current require-
ment under law so that Customs and
Border Protection must also provide
migrants not only food and water but
bathroom and shower facilities, appro-
priate nutrition, hygiene, personal
grooming items, and sanitation needs.
Based on the reports we have all seen
and the outcry from constituents in
my district, I traveled to the southern
border last week in one of the only bi-
partisan trips to have made it to the
border. What I saw, from beginning to
end, was tragedy and misery for every
link in the chain.
It was misery for migrants, who were
fearing death and persecution at home
and risked their lives to walk 1,000
miles, often with their children, in the
heat to seek asylum in the United
States.
It was misery for the thousands of
additional migrants who were just
seeking a better life and to come to
work in this country but have no easy,
legal way to do that.
It was misery for the Customs and
Border Protection officials and the
Border Patrol officials who were not
stood up and set up to do this, who
have been demonized in the press,
many of whom are first-generation
Americans, in a situation they were
never trained for.
It is misery top to bottom. That mis-
ery, for me, turned to anger because it
is because of the inability of Wash-
ington to produce comprehensive im-
migration reform that that misery is
happening.
There is so much more to do to al-
leviate the crisis at our southern bor-
der. I think all of my bipartisan col-
leagues, when we traveled to the bor-
der, felt that it was our duty to work
on bipartisan legislation so that we can
create a situation where people who we
need in this country can come here le-
gally, people who are seeking asylum
can do it legally, and we do not have to
put our customs and border officials in
this kind of stressful situation.
I thank my Republican colleagues on
the Homeland Security Committee who
voted unanimously with me on this
bill. I believe this is the first bill on
standards at our southern border to be
bipartisan. I am very proud of that. It
is a commonsense proposal that I think
Democrats, Republicans, and independ-
ents can all support.
To my colleagues who have not yet
made up their minds, the standards
outlined in this bill are simply the
same standards for our inmates in our
prisons that the Bureau of Prisons up-
holds. They are the same standards
under the Geneva Convention that any
U.S. soldier must uphold when we take
in a prisoner of war.
Those are our bare minimum stand-
ards that represent our values, and I
offer they should also be the exact
same standards we afford people com-
ing over our southern border.
The number of migrants coming over
our southern border is overwhelming.
It would overwhelm any administra-
tion, any political affiliation, but it
does not abrogate our responsibility to
maintain basic humanitarian standards
in alignment with our values.
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity must do better. From my own trip
last week, I know they want to do bet-
ter.
As I said, I am particularly grateful
to my colleagues on the other side of
the aisle who voiced support for this
bill and who came on as cosponsors.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
do the right thing, help our country as-
pire to higher standards, and support
H.R. 3670, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentle-
woman from Michigan’s efforts on this
bill. I admire her for her compassion. I
respect her intent and the spirit behind
this bill, and I hope that we can work
together to move forward.
My concern is with the letter of the
law written within this bill. I know
firsthand that showers are being pro-
vided and that personal hygiene prod-
ucts are immediately available to the
unprecedented number of people in
Customs and Border Protection cus-
tody, both from visits to the border
myself and from regular communica-
tion with brothers and sisters of law
enforcement who work the border, who
are tasked with securing our border. I
see regular emails, messages, videos, et
cetera.
My concern with this bill is that it
does not solve the problem, in my opin-
ion.
Customs and Border Protection proc-
essing facilities are outdated. Many fa-
cilities were built decades ago. They
were neither designed to process chil-
dren and families nor the massive num-
bers of illegal immigrants arriving at
our border on a daily basis.
Without providing funding for new
Customs and Border Protection facili-
ties, I am concerned that this bill
would not fix the real problem, despite
its obvious compassionate intent.
Instead of forcing Customs and Bor-
der Protection to provide a long list of
amenities to illegal immigrants, we
should be focused on quickly proc-
essing migrants and moving them out
of Customs and Border Protection cus-
tody.
Unfortunately, many of my col-
leagues across the aisle have resisted
providing funding for additional Immi-
gration and Customs Enforcement bed
space. People are being held at CPB
much longer than was ever envisioned.
My colleagues across the aisle have
supported policies that, in my opinion,
have exacerbated the crisis by refusing
to provide ICE with the resources it
needs to get people out of short-term
detention and into more suitable facili-
ties for long-term holding.
This bill is attempting to solve prob-
lems that, some would argue, are
caused by a Democratic policy decision
to restrain funding for ICE and degrade
its ability to hold illegal immigrants.
We should provide ICE the resources
it needs to conduct its mission rather
than imposing those responsibilities on
Customs and Border Protection, men
and women who are tasked with a com-
pletely different mission.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I want to address the
specific points raised by the gentleman
across the aisle.
The gentleman is correct. This bill is
not meant to fix everything. It doesn’t
get to the root of the problem.
What it does is establish very basic
humanitarian standards similar, al-
most exactly, to what we have for our
prisoners of war and our prisoners.
That is taken from the Geneva Conven-
tion. That is the international stand-
ard, and I want to meet those stand-
ards.
In many cases, the men and women
of Customs and Border Protection and
Border Patrol are absolutely meeting
those standards. I think probably, at
this point, most areas are. So, then, it
shouldn’t be a problem to enshrine it in
actual law.
I also agree that we have a major
problem in our immigration system. I
believe that strongly and even more
strongly after I went to the border this
past week, and I look forward to my
colleague working with us on bipar-
tisan immigration reform.
I think this is a minimum standard.
It is a humanitarian standard in line
with our values. It is what our law en-
forcement officers and our uniform
military already have to provide when-
ever they are in a position of deten-
tion.
I think this isn’t difficult if we are
already achieving, in most cases, these
standards across the board.
Regarding the complaint that it
doesn’t solve every problem, it was
never meant to. So let’s focus on the
bill at hand.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to share
with the gentlewoman, for whom I
have deep respect, that I believe that
the humanitarian standards that the
gentlewoman referred to are alive in
the hearts of the men and women, the
American men and women, who serve
in Customs and Border Protection on
the border. These Americans struggle
to accomplish their mission despite
overwhelming, almost impossible con-
ditions and situations, masses of hu-
manity, wave after wave of children of
God.
Indeed, the role of this body, as envi-
sioned by our Founders and supported

through the generations, is to allow
the American spirit to manifest itself
without regulation and enforced tradi-
tions and principles that are exhibited
by the very Americans whom we serve.
I deeply respect the intent of this
bill, although I have voiced my concern
regarding the letter of the language of
this bill and the purposes of my con-
cern.
I would share with Congresswoman
SLOTKIN that I am prepared to close. I
have no further speakers.
Mr. Speaker, I deeply respect her ef-
fort, while standing in opposition, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
In closing, I appreciate the gentle-
man’s comments and the spirit with
which they were delivered.
Let me say, as someone who is from
Michigan, we depend upon our Customs
and Border Protection agents, our Bor-
der Patrol agents, every single day for
our own security, for awareness of
what is coming over our border.
Mr. Speaker, we are a border State,
so you are never going to find a bigger
fan of Customs and Border Protection
and Border Patrol. I was visiting with
them in the past 10 days. They are
doing yeoman’s work, and I asked for
their advice before I went to the south-
ern border.
But we know that, despite their best
efforts, the overwhelming number of
people, combined with the complete in-
ability to be prepared for such num-
bers, means that people were going
without showers, and people were going
without access to medical care. People
were going without.
That is not what anyone wanted. I do
not believe at all that people wanted
that, but that was the reality. So I felt
it was important to lay down a clear
standard. I think the vast majority are
adhering to that standard, and I think
it is the bare minimum.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the bill under con-
sideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island?
There was no objection.
Mr. CICILLINE. I yield myself such
time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2336, the Family
Farmer Relief Act of 2019, would in-
crease the current debt limit used to
determine whether a family farmer is
eligible for relief under chapter 12 of
the Bankruptcy Code, a specialized
form of bankruptcy relief specifically
intended for family farmers, from ap-
proximately $4.4 million to $10 million.
Chapter 12 permits a family farmer
who satisfies certain eligibility criteria
to reorganize his or her debts pursuant
to a repayment plan under the super-
vision of a bankruptcy trustee. The
special attributes of chapter 12 make it
better suited to meet the particular-
ized needs of family farmers in finan-
cial distress than other forms of bank-
ruptcy relief.
Under chapter 7, for example, the
family farm and its assets would have
to be liquidated to pay the claims of
creditors, thus depriving the family
farmer of his or her livelihood, which is
completely unacceptable.
The chapter 11 process for reorga-
nization, which is typically used by
large corporations in economic distress
to reorganize complex financial trans-
actions, is also inappropriate due to its
costly and time-consuming process
that does not work for our Nation’s
small farming operations.
In light of these concerns with other
avenues for reorganization under the
Bankruptcy Code, Congress created
chapter 12 during the farm crisis of the
mid-1980s in response to a series of eco-
nomic catastrophes facing small farms,
from grain embargoes, to high interest
rates, to consolidation, and mega-
farms.
Unfortunately, many similar eco-
nomic pressures are impacting family
farmers today, who are also facing the
devastating effects of climate change,
including unprecedented weather
events and catastrophic flooding, as
well as stagnant or falling returns on
investment.
H.R. 2336 takes into consideration the
fact that modern farming operations
entail greater costs and resulting debt
than when chapter 12 was first enacted
by raising the debt threshold to qualify
for this type of bankruptcy relief to a
level more consistent with today’s op-
erations.
Accordingly, I support H.R. 2336, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the
bill.
The Family Farmer Relief Act of 2019
brings urgently needed help to a crit-
ical link in America’s economy and a
vital part of American community life,
the family farmer.
In 2005, Congress permanently en-
acted chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy
Code. Chapter 12 is specially designed
to help family farmers reorganize their
debts in time of need and keep their
farms going. In the years since, chapter
12 and its streamlined procedures have
worked well.
There has, however, been one prob-
lem. As time has passed, the cost of
running a family farm have rapidly in-
creased; the ceiling on chapter 12, on
how much debt a family farm can reor-
ganize, has lagged behind. Especially
with the advent of modern, high-tech
farming equipment, the chapter 12 ceil-
ing is no longer high enough to let
many farms with typical amounts of
debt go into chapter 12.
The Family Farmer Relief Act of 2019
fixes this problem. It raises the ceiling
from the old, roughly $4.5 million limit
to a more reasonable $10 million limit.
This means that more family farmers
will be able to successfully reorganize
when they need to, to the benefit of the
economy and local communities across
the land.
I am proud to be an original cospon-
sor of this bill. I urge my colleagues to
support the bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield
5 minutes to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. DELGADO), the author of the
bill, a relentless advocate for this leg-
islation, and a distinguished member of
the freshman class.
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Speaker, I thank
my friend, Chairman CICILLINE for
those kind words.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong
support of my bill, the Family Farmer
Relief Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7439
July 25, 2019
I rise to urge bipartisan support for a
bipartisan priority, relief for family
farmers. Passing H.R. 2336 will make
our Nation’s bankruptcy laws for farm-
ers reflective of today’s economy and
better represent the experiences of our
Nation’s farmers.
I am proud to represent New York’s
19th Congressional District, which
stretches nearly 8,000 square miles, is
made up of 11 counties, and includes
the beautiful Hudson Valley and Cats-
kill Mountains.
New York 19 is the eighth most rural
district in the country, and the third
most rural represented by a Democrat.
It is also home to nearly 5,000 farms
and over 8,000 farm operators.
The last USDA Ag Census found that
96 percent of the farms in my district
are family owned. These family-owned
farms, both in New York 19, and across
the country, are facing alarming rates
of foreclosure during this down farm
economy.
This is the fifth year on record of de-
clining net farm income. Prices are
low, inputs are high, and current trade
policies make the future for farms un-
known. 2018 marked the fourth con-
secutive year of rising bankruptcy
rates as a proportion of the farm popu-
lation.
This farm economy is exacerbated by
an outdated bankruptcy filing cap that
leaves farmers without options to re-
structure or repay their debt. Chapter
12 was created specifically to provide
repayment flexibility and reorganiza-
tional advantages for family farms dur-
ing poor economic times.
Unfortunately, this outdated debt
cap has rendered chapter 12 an inacces-
sible tool for thousands of farm fami-
lies.
Mr. Speaker, the numbers tell the
story here. According to the National
Farm Bureau, last year just 498 farms
filed for chapter 12 bankruptcy. By
comparison, 766,000 consumers filed
under chapters 7 and 13.
Over the last 10 years, chapter 7 and
chapter 13 have seen 10 million total
filings, compared to just 5,000 Chapter
12 filings.
Mr. Speaker, we must do more.
The Family Farmer Relief Act solu-
tion is simple. My one-sentence bill
would adjust the debt cap to align with
today’s land values and the cost of
doing business for today’s farmers. Our
legislation modifies chapter 12 bank-
ruptcy rules to raise the debt cap for
eligibility to $10 million.
This adjustment will provide farmers
additional options to manage the cur-
rent farm economy and allows farmers
to retain assets and remain oper-
ational. Allowing farmers increased
flexibility is critical to the health and
wellness of our family farmers and the
Upstate economy at large.
I thank House leadership for bringing
this important bill to the floor, and
also Subcommittee Chairman CICILLINE
for his support and leadership on the
Judiciary Committee.
In addition, I want to thank Senator
GRASSLEY for his ongoing leadership on
this issue in the Senate.
And lastly, I want to thank my bipar-
tisan House colead, Judiciary Sub-
committee Ranking Member JIM SEN-
SENBRENNER, House Agriculture Com-
mittee Chairman COLLIN PETERSON,
and Representatives TJ COX, KELLY
ARMSTRONG, and DUSTY JOHNSON.
I look forward to seeing this bill
move forward so we can give our farm-
ers and growers the support and flexi-
bility they need in these hard times.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Speak-
er, I have no further speakers. I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, H.R.
2336 is a commonsense, bipartisan solu-
tion. I applaud the gentleman from
New York (Mr. DELGADO) for his leader-
ship on this bill to help our Nation’s
family-owned farms.
This legislation is supported by the
nonpartisan American Bankruptcy In-
stitute, as well the American College of
Bankruptcy. It currently has more
than 27 bipartisan cosponsors, includ-
ing our distinguished colleague, the
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. SEN-
SENBRENNER).
I encourage my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle to pass H.R. 2336.
I yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.
CICILLINE) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2336, as
amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

Messrs. CLINE, MARCHANT, and
GRAVES of Missouri changed their
vote from ‘‘yea’’ to ‘‘nay.’’

VENEZUELA TPS ACT OF 2019
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
CARSON of Indiana). Pursuant to clause
1(c) of rule XIX, further consideration
of the bill (H.R. 549) to designate Ven-
ezuela under section 244 of the Immi-
gration and Nationality Act to permit
nationals of Venezuela to be eligible
for temporary protected status under
such section, and for other purposes,
will now resume.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
MOTION TO RECOMMIT
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I have a motion to recommit at the
desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentleman opposed to the bill?
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. I am in its
present form.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.
The Clerk read as follows:
Mr. Reschenthaler moves to recommit the
bill H.R. 549 to the Committee on the Judici-
ary with instructions to report the same
back to the House forthwith with the fol-
lowing amendment:
Page 1, line 11, before the comma, insert

July 25, 2019
implemented by the regimes of Hugo Chavez
and Nicolas Maduro’’.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 min-
utes in support of his motion.
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, the motion to recommit I am offer-
ing today is a very simple one. The mo-
tion to recommit inserts language into
this bill that blames Venezuela’s eco-
nomic, humanitarian, security, and ref-
ugee crisis squarely where it belongs,
on socialism.
This crisis is a direct result of years
of socialist policies implemented by
the authoritative regimes of Hugo Cha-
vez and Nicolas Maduro. Venezuela
should be the wealthiest country in
South America. Indeed, it once was.
However, like all socialist regimes,
Chavez and Maduro ripped power from
the hands of their people, depriving
Venezuelans of their personal liberties
and relegating them to poverty, death,
and despair.
In socialist countries, the govern-
ment no longer serves the people; the
people serve the government.
Venezuela is currently experiencing,
according to The New York Times, the
worst economic collapse outside of war
in the last half-century. The country’s
economy has shrunk twice as much as
the Soviet bloc’s economy did during
their collapse.
Venezuelans continue to suffer from
shortages of food, medicine, and simple
commodities. Inflation is set to reach
10 million percent this year.
Ten million percent inflation? Mr.
Speaker, that is unthinkable.
Venezuela’s economy is so bad and
its inflation is so out of control that,
according to Bloomberg, a haircut
costs five bananas and two eggs. It is
absolutely ridiculous. This is what it
has come to in Venezuela.
One-tenth of the population has fled
the country due to economic collapse
and government repression.
As Margaret Thatcher once said, the
problem with socialism is that eventu-
ally you run out of other people’s
money.
Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, I was
fortunate enough to get to the border
of Colombia and Venezuela. In fact, I
was with a bipartisan, bicameral dele-
gation to the border. I talked to refu-
gees about the conditions from which
they fled.
I heard stories of physicians who
were performing surgeries with
smartphone lights because the lights in
the operating room went off and on.
I heard stories from family members
who said that their other family mem-
bers were dying because they couldn’t
get penicillin for simple wounds and in-
fections.
I saw a woman crossing a river in a
wheelchair because she was desperately
seeking medical attention. It was truly
heartbreaking.
To this day, over 3 million Ven-
ezuelans have fled for Colombia while
the ruthless Maduro regime blocks hu-
manitarian aid into Venezuela.
Yet, Mr. Speaker, sadly, Members of
this very body continue to stand with
Maduro. Mr. Speaker, while Members
of this very body stand with Maduro,
they simultaneously refuse to recog-
nize Guaido as the legitimate President
of Venezuela. They continue to blame
the United States for Venezuela’s col-
lapse. They align themselves with the
disastrous, inhumane policies of social-
ism.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
call the crisis in Venezuela for what it
is: the result of unfettered socialism. I
ask that they support this motion to
recommit, which won’t kill the bill and
which won’t delay its adoption.
We must send a strong message; we
must send a united message; and we
must send a message to the world that
the United States is a beacon of free-
dom and hope, that the United States
will always fight oppression, and that
the United States will always empower
the people.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Mr.
Speaker, I claim the time in opposition
to this motion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Florida is recognized
for 5 minutes.
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Mr.
Speaker, this is an outrageous and
truly insulting amendment meant to
do nothing more than to score cheap
political points.
Let’s be clear, Republicans are offer-
ing this amendment to take a stand
against a socialist dictator, but they
plan to vote against this bill, a bill
that does nothing more than protect
people from that very dictator. In
other words, Republicans want to say
that they support the Venezuelan peo-
ple, but they are completely unwilling
to do anything for them.
I have just one thing to say to my
Republican colleagues: Venezuelans
don’t need your empty words. They
need action now.
Let’s be clear: Every American op-
poses dictatorial oppression, whether it
comes from the far left or from the far
right. In South America, we have seen
dictators from the right and the left,
like Augusto Pinochet in Chile or
Jorge Rafael Videla in Argentina, both
of whom killed and disappeared thou-
sands of their own citizens in pursuit of
rightwing agendas.
During those regimes, we condemned
dictators. I hope you remember those
times, Mr. Speaker. We did not use the
tragedy of the people to score cheap po-
litical points.
We all oppose dictatorship and tyr-
anny. It is what binds us together as
Americans.
Coming from South America, I un-
derstand very well what happens when
we see a dictator rise, when it goes un-
checked. Instead of honoring demo-
cratic principles, this amendment uses
it as a political weapon to divide our
Nation.
That is bad enough, but it is worse
when those who offer the amendment
are also unwilling to help oppressed
people who find themselves in a similar
situation to the countless immigrants
who came to Plymouth Rock, Ellis Is-
land, or the Freedom Tower.
Let me ask this: Do you think that
oppressed Venezuelans, immigrants
who desperately fled to the United
States to seek refuge, prefer that we
vote and waste our time on an empty
condemnation or that we pass mean-
ingful legislation to prevent the ad-
ministration from deporting them back
to a country suffering one of the worst
humanitarian crises in this hemi-
sphere?
Trump has said that he condemns
Maduro and that he supports the Ven-
ezuelan people, but his words are as
empty as this Republican motion be-
fore us.
Trump’s hypocritical immigration
policies have left this House no other
option but to act. We have the oppor-
tunity to set aside politics, like 37 of
my Republican colleagues did on Tues-
day, and do right by our Venezuelan
brothers and sisters.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘no’’ on this motion to recommit.
Let’s support our Venezuelan broth-
ers and sisters. ‘‘Apoyemos a nuestros
hermanos venezolanos.’’
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit.
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion to recommit.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the noes appeared to have it.
RECORDED VOTE
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I demand a recorded vote.
A recorded vote was ordered.

ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair

CELEBRATING INTERNATIONAL
AUTOMAKERS
(Mr. BAIRD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to celebrate the positive impact that
international automakers’ investments
have made in the United States and,
specifically, in my home State of Indi-
ana.
Today, international automakers op-
erate 30 manufacturing facilities across
12 States, including 3 in Indiana, and
build more than 60 different vehicle
models across the country.
Eleven models are produced in my
home State, including the Subaru As-
cent, Impreza, Legacy, and Outback,
which are all built in Lafayette, in our
Fourth Congressional District.
In addition to Subaru, Indiana is also
home to Honda Manufacturing of Indi-
ana and Toyota Motor Manufacturing
Indiana.
Overall, international automakers in
Indiana have directly employed more
than 13,000 Hoosiers and helped support
more than 126,000 local jobs via direct
and indirect employment, produced
over 1 million vehicles in 2018, and in-
vested $7.5 billion in our State’s econ-
omy.
For 50 years and counting, inter-
national automakers have thrived in
this country, thanks to an economy
that welcomes investment, competi-
tion, and innovation.
I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing the important role of inter-
national automakers in the United
States.
f
REJECT ATTACKS ON SNAP
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, 2 days
ago, I received an email from a con-
stituent, a professor at a community
college in Allentown, Pennsylvania.
Many of her students depend on SNAP
benefits, and she reached out to me,
deeply worried after hearing reports of
the administration’s plans to further
undermine SNAP through extreme new
executive actions.
These changes would cut assistance
to over 3 million people across our
country, including children, veterans,
disabled Americans, and seniors.
I wish I could send her a reassuring
response. It is truly a shameful time in
America when we give tax cuts to bil-
lionaires and huge corporations, but we
can’t help folks falling on hard times
put food on their tables.
Around 44 percent of SNAP bene-
ficiaries, nationally, are children, and
research shows that SNAP not only re-
duces hunger and malnutrition, but
also improves American people’s lives
in a whole range of other ways, includ-
ing improving children’s education
outcomes.
We cannot turn our backs on those
we were sent here to serve. Let’s stand
together, Democrats and Republicans,
alike, just as when we worked together
to protect SNAP benefits in the farm
bill, and reject these deeply immoral
attacks on our most vulnerable fellow
citizens.

HONORING CENTRE COUNTY LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS OF
THE YEAR JOHN ASTON AND
JEFFREY EBECK
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ap-
plaud the bravery, dedication, and sac-
rifice of two of Centre County’s finest
law enforcement officers.
Each year, the Centre County Dis-
trict Attorney’s Office accepts nomina-
tions from the public, law enforcement
agencies, and government agencies for
the Centre County Law Enforcement
Officers of the Year award.
Earlier this month, State College Po-
lice Officer John Aston and Pennsyl-
vania State Trooper Jeffrey Ebeck
were recognized as this year’s recipi-
ents.
Aston has been a part of the borough
police department for yearly 25 years
and was promoted to detective in 2003.
His experience in cellphone, computer,
and internet forensics has been critical
in a variety of high-profile cases in
Centre County.
Ebeck became a state trooper in 2002
and has been described as a man of
strong character and integrity.
First responders like Aston and
Ebeck certainly deserve to be recog-
nized for their work. But the men and
women who choose these careers don’t
do so for the accolades. They do so be-
cause of their commitment to service
and to safety.
f
IN SUPPORT OF THE VENEZUELA
TPS ACT
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I rise to support H.R. 549, the Ven-
ezuela TPS Act of 2019.
This particular bill designates Ven-
ezuela for temporary protected status
for an initial 18-month period begin-
ning on the date of enactment, and
such designation would allow eligible
nationals of Venezuela who are in the
United States on the date of enactment
to register for TPS benefits, including
temporary immigration status and em-
ployment authorization.
Let me indicate that, in my commu-
nity in Houston, there are a number of
Venezuelans who have told their story
of fleeing and leaving behind family
members. Many of them, however, have
had the opportunity to be in this coun-
try to be safe but still to be concerned
about family members.
We know that there are difficult
times in Venezuela. It is important for
the United States to engage diplomati-
cally to try and resolve this.
We know there are medical crises,
health crises, crises of family separa-
tion, and violence.
So, I would make the point that this
is an important initiative, and I would
also say that I would like to thank one
of the constituents in my community,
CITGO, a company that has many Ven-
ezuelans working there but has been a
generous supporter of Houston.
I believe that it is important to try
and resolve these issues to bring peace
to Venezuela. TPS is appropriate, and
we should do it now.

(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, the
United States has long stood guard
against ideologies that would under-
mine the principles of our democracy.
Historically, the Boycott, Divestment
and Sanctions, or BDS, movement has
been regarded as inconsistent with
American values and in opposition to
alliance with Israel.
Unfortunately, support for the BDS
movement has been voiced in the
House of Representatives. Supporting
this measure shows disregard for the
longstanding bond that the United
States has developed with Israel as a
trustworthy ally in the Middle East.
The United States has never turned a
blind eye to our allies, and every Mem-
ber of this legislative body should take
steps to ensure that we do not betray

the enduring trust we have developed
with our friend, the nation of Israel,
and its people.
We, as the House of Representatives,
should bring up H.R. 336, the com-
prehensive legislation addressing the
anti-BDS issue. I encourage my col-
leagues to support additional measures
to protect against the BDS movement
and uphold our friendship with the
great nation of Israel.

CELEBRATING THE 29TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE AMERICANS WITH
DISABILITIES ACT
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, to-
morrow we celebrate the 29th anniver-
sary of the Americans with Disabilities
Act, a groundbreaking civil rights law
that has improved the lives of millions
across the Nation, including my own.
However, the fight for equality and in-
clusion is not over.
Over the past year, I have collabo-
rated with disability advocates and
lawmakers from both sides of the aisle
to pass bills that strengthen protec-
tions for airline passengers with dis-
abilities, expand caregiver services for
disabled veterans, and establish a more
inclusive emergency preparedness and
disaster planning process.
I have also called for the Federal
Government to account for its hiring
and retention of disabled workers, in-
creased funding for spinal cord injury
research, co-led legislation to help
small businesses break down accessi-
bility barriers and passed a bill in the
House to authorize $200 million for res-
pite care services.
Madam Speaker, these efforts are
only the beginning, and I cannot and
will not stop fighting until we achieve
the goal of equal opportunity, full in-
clusion, and economic self-sufficiency
for people with disabilities everywhere.
f
WE MUST CONDEMN ANTI-
SEMITISM
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise
today because a resolution was intro-
duced in this body last week sup-
porting the Boycott, Divestment and
Sanctions, or BDS movement, against
the State of Israel. Again, seemingly
right after this body passed another
resolution condemning anti-Semitism,
this backwards ideology has reared its
ugly head once again in the form of H.
Res. 496.
I have come to the floor today to
speak to the supporters of bills like
these and the 22 Members who either
voted ‘‘nay’’ or ‘‘present’’ on H. Res.
246 earlier this week, to remind them
that Israel is the only stable democ-
racy in an otherwise volatile region of
the world.
It is a place where women serve in
the military and hold high office. It is
a place where all people are able to ex-
press their views without threat from
the government. It is a place where
Arab citizens are elected to the
Knesset. Bottom line, Israel values
human rights.
Madam Speaker, we must condemn
anti-Semitism no matter where it
comes from, and I am glad the House
did that earlier this week.
f
CELEBRATING AUGUST 4 AS
COAST GUARD DAY
(Mr. CRIST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. CRIST. Madam Speaker, today I
rise to celebrate August 4 as Coast
Guard Day, marking the service’s
founding by Alexander Hamilton in
1790. We are very grateful for the brave
men and women of the United States
Coast Guard who selflessly serve Amer-
ica, both at home and abroad.
My congressional district of Pinellas
County, Florida, is proud to be home to
numerous Coast Guard commands,
both ashore and afloat. We have the
largest and busiest air station in the
country, Air Station Clearwater, and a
robust maritime operation at Sector
St. Petersburg.
Coast Guard families serve as well,
providing the Coasties themselves with
the support and resilience they depend
on to stand watch, day in and day out.
So, Madam Speaker, I would like to
wish a happy 229th birthday to the
United States Coast Guard.
f
FIRE PREVENTION
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, 1
year ago, on July 23, the Carr fire
broke out in Shasta County, California,
near Reading, sometimes referred to as
a ‘‘firenado’’ that burned nearly 230,000
acres and destroyed 1,600 structures.
Most tragically of all, it took eight
lives.
It took over a month to fully extin-
guish what became one of the most de-
structive fires in California State his-
tory. For those impacted by it, it must
have felt like the blink of an eye. Ev-
erything they owned went up in smoke.
Now, a year later, everyone is still
working the recovery process as best as
can be done. It is still not easy.
In the aftermath of this disaster, and
even during it, our community showed
just how strong and resilient our peo-
ple are. Families, friends, and neigh-
bors came together to help each other
in any possible way, with water, food,
clothes, everything they needed, and
they have continued to do so for the
whole year.
Some of the first homes are now
being completed as people are moving
forward, a good sign.
Preventing another fire like this is
one of my top priorities. The Carr fire
was started when a flat tire caused a
wheel to scrape against the asphalt and
create a spark in the nearby forested
area; so I have introduced legislation
called the CARR Act, Combustion
Avoidance on Rural Roads Act, which
helps avoid this sort of combustion on
rural roads by allowing categorical ex-
clusions to clear vegetation within 300
feet of a roadway.
We have got much to do, and for peo-
ple who lost everything, this is preven-
tion that will help keep it from hap-
pening again.

CONGRATULATING MIKE
LANGFORD
(Mr. LEVIN of Michigan asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate
Mike Langford on his retirement.
Mike had served as the president of
the Utility Workers Union of America
since 2006 and has been a major leader
of that union for many decades.
During his time at the UWUA, Mike
has worked hard to bring about over-
due reform that delivers safe, reliable,
cost-effective, and environmentally
friendly utility services across this
whole country.
I share his commitment to a cleaner
environment and more affordable serv-
ices for working families. And, as a
former union organizer, I thank Mike
for his outstanding dedication to
American workers.
Indeed, I can personally attest to
Mike’s stalwart leadership of all Amer-
ican workers as a member of the AFL–
CIO Executive Council. And I also want
to point out that America’s veterans
have had no better friend than Mike
Langford, who helped set up programs
to train hundreds and thousands of
them for careers in the utility indus-
try.
I ask my colleagues to join me in
congratulating Mike on his retirement
and on wishing him the very best for
the next chapter of his life.

United States. While we have got thou-
sands of people pouring across our bor-
der, while ICE does not have the re-
sources it needs to do its job, this body
is adjourning.
I had 40 of my colleagues, give or
take—and it is a growing list—that
have asked the Speaker that we should
stay here. We should not adjourn. How
can we possibly adjourn without giving
ICE the resources it needs for the beds
to be able to put people, to be able to
deal with the border crisis? Yet, that is
what this body is going to do.
It is unconscionable that we are al-
lowing our border to stay open, and
that this body is going to adjourn, go
home and, for 6 weeks, not do our duty
as a sovereign Nation to have a secure
border, to make sure migrants can
come here safely; but more impor-
tantly, that our law enforcement has
the tools that it needs to do the job
that we ask them to do when they are
standing on the line every day defend-
ing this country.
With cartels having operational con-
trol of our border, endangering this
country, it is our duty to do it. We
should stay here.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF JUDY
SCHNEIDER
(Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to offer my deep gratitude
and appreciation to someone who has
played an inspirational and indispen-
sable role in Congress for more than 4
decades, my great friend, my guide,
Judy Schneider.
After a legendary career as a Spe-
cialist on Congress at the Congres-
sional Research Service—really, the
specialist, ultimate specialist, on Con-
gress—Judy is retiring; and I want to
let her know how much she will be
missed.
I was fortunate to meet Judy even
before I was sworn into the Congress.
And as soon as I met her, I realized
that I need Judy Schneider to be my
mentor, and I was fortunate that she
agreed to do that.
Judy has won many well-deserved ac-
colades; but I think that her greatest
reward is knowing that she has
mentored and trained and inspired so
many that have gone on to use her les-
sons about how Congress works, how it
really works, how it should work, and
then how it really works. That has
been the lesson that has improved peo-
ple’s lives and the Members of Con-
gress’ lives and well-being.
So, Judy, I thank you. I love you, and
I wish you everything good.

CONGRATULATING EVAN
DOLISZNY FOR HIS ACHIEVE-
MENTS
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker,
Evan Doliszny of Ocean City, in South
Jersey, recently received the Congres-
sional Award Gold Medal, along with
the STEM Star award for his work in
mathematics.
Evan is one of only 538 students in
the Nation and 20 in New Jersey to
achieve this honor, which was estab-
lished in 1979 to recognize and cele-
brate ‘‘Initiative, Achievement, Serv-
ice’’ in our young people.
Evan is truly living out those ideals.
He participated in over 611 hours of
volunteer service for his community,
over 1,148 hours developing his aca-
demic comprehension skills, and over
1,040 hours with his team sport of crew.
Evan is passionate about Middle
Eastern traditions, culture, and his-
tory, and his goal is to work in inter-
national finance.
Evan, your service and dedication to
South Jersey is wonderful, and your
accomplishments make clear that you
have a bright, a very bright, future
ahead of you.
Congratulations on your achieve-
ment. We are very proud of you in
South Jersey.
Evan, keep on going.

WHERE IS OUR INFRASTRUCTURE
PLAN?
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam
Speaker, in our first 200 days in this
Congress, we have passed an incredible
amount of legislation to root out cor-
ruption, protect healthcare, and com-
bat the opioid epidemic.
Unfortunately, most of it, though,
has died in the legislative graveyard of
the Senate at the hands of MITCH
MCCONNELL.
Now, there have been rare moments,
like the 9/11 Victim Compensation
Fund, where we have managed to do
the right thing.
But as we prepare to go back for a
month of work outside of these Cham-
bers, I ask one simple question: Where
is our infrastructure bill? Because my
constituents at home are sick and tired
of their commute; sick and tired of
their bridges and their roads that are
falling apart.
So I put this question to each and
every Member of the House, leadership
in both parties, and the President him-
self.
Let’s get the job done. Let’s pass a
real infrastructure bill.
And you know what? If the Repub-
licans do not want to play ball, if they
don’t even want to sit at the table with
us, then let’s pass something out of
this Chamber and put a very simple
question to the Senate, a very simple
question to the President of the United
States: Whose side are you on?
Are you on the side of the lobbyists,
the corporate PACs, the wealthiest
amongst us?
Or are you finally on the side of the
hardworking Americans that you try
to speak to every few years during
election season?

THE CRISIS AT OUR SOUTHERN
BORDER
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. GARCÍA) is recognized for 60
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, to begin Special Orders, I ask
for unanimous consent that Members
may have 5 legislative days to revise
and extend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois?
There was no objection.
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I would like to thank Rep-
resentatives POCAN, PORTER, TLAIB,
and JAYAPAL. We are here today to call
for justice for immigrants. We are here
to put a spotlight on President
Trump’s harmful attacks on immi-
grants and asylum seekers.
Since President Trump took office,
he has implemented some of the
harshest and most racist immigration
policies in our country’s history.
Trump is also repeating one of the
worst themes in our history, that of re-
lentless attacks designed to divide our
country. Trump wants people to think
that brown and black immigrants are
not worthy of compassion, legal due
process, or human rights.
Despite organizing in our commu-
nities, the Trump White House has con-
tinued to push forward its anti-immi-
grant agenda. As an immigrant myself,
the stories break my heart and make
me really angry.
A year ago, the separation of families
and the caging of children shocked the
conscience of Americans. A year later,
we all mourned the deaths of Oscar
Martinez Ramirez and his daughter
Angie Valeria, who were found on the
edge of a river embankment, both
drowned in an effort to reach the prom-
ise of America.
We used to think that sharing vul-
nerable images of the deceased children
would elicit our deepest emotions and
that would be enough for change, but
even after the deaths of Oscar and his
daughter, children continued dying at
the hands of this administration, and
nothing has changed.
It is tempting to become desen-
sitized. It is easy to believe that this is
the new normal. This is anything but

normal. This is unprecedented. When-
ever a scandal comes out or the Presi-
dent feels threatened, he comes after
immigrants and those who do not look
like him.
It is unconscionable that the Presi-
dent has put lives, families, children,
and communities in danger in a blatant
effort to distract the media and our
country.
Today is an opportunity for my col-
leagues and me to, one, put a face on
the people being impacted by these
policies—people are real lives—frame
this as the agenda of a President and a
party who seek to hold power by divid-
ing Americans, and to remind our
country that every attack is con-
nected. This is all part of a broader
agenda of hate.
I now yield to the gentlewoman from
Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY).
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
I am really so proud and grateful to
join you, Congressman GARCÍA. We are
both from Illinois, and we see some of
the same examples of the fear that is
plaguing our communities wherever
there are immigrants.
And I want to tell you, I take this
issue very personally. Neither of my
parents were born in the United States
of America, but they came here as
small children with their parents, who
made a really good life.
My grandfather had a horse and
wagon and actually sold vegetables in
Humboldt Park, part of your district
right now, carrying heavy bags of pota-
toes up and down the stairs.
Four children, and they all went to
college. They made a good life, and now
his granddaughter is in the United
States Congress.
Well, I will tell you, my grand-
parents, my parents did not live with
the fear that this President has
brought to millions and millions of
people and, of course, people in our dis-
trict.
I want to just tell you that exactly 1
week ago today, I flew home, landed at
O’Hare Airport in Chicago, and heard
that something was happening over at
the international terminal, that there
was now a crowd of people and there
were children ages, I think it was 16, 10,
and 9, minors, who were being held at
the airport. These were citizen chil-
dren.
Why were they being held there?
They came from Mexico. They had
been there on vacation. They came
with an adult relative of theirs who
had a valid passport, but for some rea-
son Customs and Border Protection
sent that adult back to Mexico—we are
investigating exactly why—and now
said only the mother could pick up
these minor children.
Well, I get that, except that their
brother, who is a DACA recipient older
than them, an adult, came to pick
them up, and they were not released. A
lawyer was there with a signed affi-
davit witnessed by members of the con-
sulate, the Mexican consulate. They
would not release the children to her.
By now, there was a crowd of people
holding signs ‘‘Release the children.’’
They had arrived at about 3 in the
morning. They were given two cots
during the night, meaning one of those
girls had to sleep on the floor.
This is what is happening at the bor-
der, of course—mistreating children.
So, finally, there was an agreement
that was made: Okay, Mom will come.
Guess what? Mom is undocumented.
She was afraid to come, but she came,
surrounded by the Mexican consulate,
by the lawyer, by me, to make sure
that she was able to take her children
home.
We heard that members of Customs
and Border Protection said—and we are
investigating this, too—that, if these
were normal circumstances, that moth-
er would have been detained.
Understand, they would have de-
tained the mother of citizen children
who just wanted to travel to Mexico,
come home, and go be with their par-
ents.
What is going on in the United States
of America? We fear that children like
that are being used to lure undocu-
mented parents to the airport. That is
what we fear. And this is just one ex-
ample of one family, of one problem
that had to be resolved.
I am telling you, I am so heart-
broken. I am going to the border on
Wednesday, and I want to go see again
for myself what is going on down there.
But we have to say, no, this cannot
happen. We are the country of the
Statue of Liberty, the Statue of Lib-
erty that welcomed my father and his
family to this country, not the family
of walls and fear and mistreatment and
children dying in custody.
No, Mr. President, this is not the
America that we all deserve.
And thank you, Congressman, for
leading this discussion.
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from
Vermont (Mr. WELCH).
Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I want
to thank Congressman GARCÍA for
yielding.
I am from Vermont, and it is hard to
be farther from the southern border in
the United States than being in
Vermont, but the question that people
ask me in Vermont, really, more than
anything else, is how is it that in the
name of our government, under the au-
thority of our flag, we have instituted
a policy, since rescinded, to take chil-
dren away from parents? How is that
possible?
The President talks about a crisis at
the border. No argument about that;
there is a crisis at the border. But is
the right response to it that you sepa-
rate families? Is the right response
that you call the people who are com-
ing gang members and rapists and kill-
ers?
I went to the border, as well, and met
many of the women and the men and
the children who were there, and as
you know better than anybody—and,
by the way, I really appreciate your
leadership on this and the leadership of
the Congressional Hispanic Caucus—
the people who are there are there out
of desperation.
One woman I spoke to, who was from
Guatemala, told us that she had a 13-
year-old daughter, and her husband had
already been murdered, and the mother
was told that her daughter was going
to become the girlfriend of one of the
gang members. It was that fear that
made her leave her home.
People do not want to leave their
home, and they only do it when they
absolutely have to to save their lives.
She and her daughter set out in the
night for the more than 1,000-mile jour-
ney to the southern border. About two-
thirds of the way there, the mother
started getting nervous, hearing sto-
ries, wondering what it would be like,
and said to her daughter: Honey, we
have got to go back.
The daughter looked at the mother
and said: Mom, we can’t. We are not
safe. You are not safe, and I am not
safe.
They arrived at the southern border,
and they make an effort to cross the
bridge and are not allowed because of
the go-slow policy and no capacity to
‘‘process.’’
They wade across the river and turn
themselves in, and their request is for
asylum. That has been criminalized by
the Trump administration. The daugh-
ter and the mother are separated.
When we were with the mom, she
didn’t know where her daughter was. Is
she a rapist? Is she a criminal? Is she
an MS–13 member? She is a mom try-
ing to protect her daughter. She is a
mother who lost her husband already.
Now, there is not an easy answer to
that, and none of us suggest there is.
But it is not the answer to say that
anybody who is seeking to save their
life, fleeing economic desperation, flee-
ing physical violence, seeking to pro-
tect a son or a daughter, is a criminal.
They are asking for help.
And it is a tough question: How much
help can we give? We have to have se-
cure borders, but are we solving the
problem by making it a crime to ask
for help? Are we solving the problem by
taking kids and separating them from
their parents? Are we solving the prob-
lem where we cut aid off to the coun-
tries Honduras, Guatemala, and El Sal-
vador, where most of the people are
coming from? The answer to that is no.
And this is a hard problem, but it
can’t be resolved unless there is some
mutual recognition on both sides that
it is something we have to work to-
gether to try to address.
There are refugees around the world.
There are some refugees who are com-
ing to our southern border. But this is
becoming a worldwide problem, and it
is a combination of factors of failed
states, of environmental damage, of
economic desperation; and we have to
address this in a way that we acknowl-
edge the obligation we have to one an-
other.
So my hope is that the President,
whose leadership on this is absolutely

essential, tones it down and acknowl-
edges that this is an issue that we have
to work together to solve, and it is not
just the heel of the boot that is going
to solve it, not just the punitive meas-
ures of taking kids from parents that is
going to solve it, not just cutting off
aid to Honduras, Guatemala, and El
Salvador that is going to solve it.
We are ready to work, and we need to
work because it is, more than anything
else, essential that we acknowledge the
responsibility all of us have, whatever
our policies are, to treat people hu-
manely.
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. GARCÍA
so much for his work on this, and I
pledge to continue working with the
gentleman every way I can.
b 1845
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I thank Congressman WELCH,
Congresswoman SCHAKOWSKY of Illi-
nois, and the Congressional Progressive
Caucus for allowing me to lead this
conversation.
The remarks of the previous speaker
are a good segue to some background
information from a historical context
that I will share in the rest of the pro-
ceeding.
Migrants are escaping some of the
harshest regimes in Central America,
where political and economic turmoil
have generated abject poverty, abuse,
and violent crime.
Unlike many previous waves of im-
migrants, Central Americans are not
arriving for purely economic reasons or
to pursue the American Dream. In-
stead, they are coming to seek safety
and the chance to live without fear of
death, rape, or abuse.
Those coming to our border now are
families, newborns, children, and preg-
nant women escaping life-or-death sit-
uations as well as poverty. These deep-
ly rooted causes and push factors help
explain why so many Salvadorans,
Guatemalans, and Hondurans are flee-
ing their countries and heading toward
the U.S.
El Salvador. El Salvador has been
trapped in a cycle of violence that can
be traced back to its civil war, in
which the U.S. was complicit.
The MS–13 gang, which many politi-
cians like to talk about, and frequently
referred to by the President in jus-
tification of his hardline immigration
policies, was actually formed in L.A.,
in Los Angeles, California, and intro-
duced into El Salvador when its mem-
bers were deported, often to a country
they barely knew.
Guatemala also comes out of a great
conflict in that country. Jakelin Caal
Maquin, the 7-year-old Guatemalan girl
who died in El Paso in December from
cardiac arrest caused by severe dehy-
dration and shock, was forced to leave
her home due to severe poverty. Her
relatives explained that her father did
all he could to stay in the land, but ne-
cessity made him try to get to the U.S.
Honduras. Gender-based violence is
the second leading cause of death for
women in Honduras. In a country
where emergency contraception and
abortion are banned even for rape vic-
tims, survivors of sexual violence have
few options if they become pregnant.
They can seek to terminate the preg-
nancy and risk prison time, or they can
go through with it and face one of the
highest maternal mortality rates in all
of Latin America.
As a parent, I understand and
empathize with parents who will do
whatever it takes to give their children
a better life. When you have a gun to
your head, people threatening to rape
your child, extort your business, or
force your son to work for the cartels,
what would you do?
Aid to the Northern Triangle region
of Central America is a long-standing
pillar of American foreign policy sup-
ported by most Democrats and Repub-
licans in Congress. Providing humani-
tarian aid to countries in the Northern
Triangle will help stabilize those
economies and lift millions out of pov-
erty in the process.
Establishing economic stability in
those nations is at the root of an effec-
tive strategy to reduce the current
surge in migrants seeking asylum and,
ultimately, an effort to solve the root
causes of the humanitarian crisis at
the border.
Despite this understanding from the
State Department, the Trump adminis-
tration is reducing aid. Annual assist-
ance to Central America has declined
by nearly 30 percent since fiscal year
2016. Funding is crucial to programs
that focus on good governance, eco-
nomic growth, and social welfare in the
Northern Triangle.
This is an issue of national security
in our country and basic human needs
and dignity abroad.
Instead of receiving children and
families with open arms, President
Trump is cutting foreign aid for coun-
tries in the Northern Triangle, further
exacerbating conditions there and ulti-
mately feeding into his manufactured
crisis at the border. Potentially hun-
dreds of thousands more will be forced
to make the difficult decision and head
toward the U.S., and the administra-
tion knows this.
Aid is not an immediate fix or the ul-
timate solution. An investment in the
region can, however, help mitigate vio-
lence, corruption, and poverty, which
can help over the long term.
The State Department’s recent an-
nouncement to put $180 million on
hold, to divert further funds, will im-
pact political stability and economic
opportunities in those countries and,
therefore, the push factors affecting
migration.
President Trump was right when he
declared a crisis at the border. What he
failed to explain is the role this admin-
istration has played in aggravating the
situation.
There is real suffering. Every day,
refugees arriving at the southern bor-
der are being detained and held in in-
humane conditions, children locked in
cages and infants dying in our care.
The bottom line is very simple. The
President has made the crisis at the
border significantly worse, and it will
only intensify with cuts in foreign as-
sistance to the Northern Triangle.
President Trump is waging an as-
sault on all fronts against immigrants
and asylum seekers and a full assault
against the very morals and founding
principles of our country, principles of
acceptance, inclusiveness, and refuge
for those who seek its shelter.
In the interior, for Americans living
away from the border, it can often
seem like the President’s assault on
immigrants and asylum seekers is a
distant issue we see on the news, but
the truth is that the President’s terror-
izing of communities extends to our
backyards, our schools, our neighbor-
hoods, and our church congregations
throughout the country.
I want to take a moment to share a
story and give a face to the problem.
Without understanding our own per-
sonal stake in the well-being of our
friends, coworkers, and neighbors, we
cannot fully grasp the extent of the
President’s assault. Nothing we do in
these Halls is worth debating if we are
not willing to understand how our deci-
sions ultimately affect people’s lives.
ICE raids are happening not only at
the border. These government actions
that separate families and tear chil-
dren from their mothers are happening
in well-established immigrant commu-
nities around the country, including
many in my district in Chicago.
Francisca Lino, a mother and grand-
mother from Chicago, is living this re-
ality as we speak. She is married to a
U.S. citizen. She has three U.S.-citizen
children and other grandchildren.
A law-abiding, hardworking woman
who had never received even a parking
ticket in her life received an order of
deportation under the Trump adminis-
tration. As a result, she was forced to
seek sanctuary in a church, where she
has been living for the past 2 years.
During this time, besides being away
from her children and husband, she
also missed the birth of her grandson
Diego.
Confined to a space that welcomed
her but is not by any means suitable
for someone to live without the possi-
bility of ever going out, Francisca and
her family are asking for our help.
If she ever tried to step out for a mo-
ment, she can be sure that she would
be caught by ICE officials, who are con-
stantly surveilling the church.
Her decision to fight back against
Trump’s cruel immigration policies
have taken a toll on her family. Her
daughters have suffered emotional
trauma, but that is not all. As a pro-
vider for her family, the void she left
when she took sanctuary has been felt
economically as well.
In my district and around the coun-
try, there are many people like
Francisca who have been nothing but
law-abiding, hardworking neighbors,
contributing to our economy by paying
taxes and supporting the community
they live in.

In return, however, many of our
neighbors, who are no different than
ourselves, save for the lack of certain
papers, have been met with oppression
from an administration that is hellbent
on using immigrants as scapegoats to
explain the deep-rooted problems in
our country.
It is up to Congress to point out the
real problems and stop Trump’s
xenophobic and irrational policies.
ICE raids throughout the country
continue to terrorize families and com-
munities, hurt our local economies and
small businesses, and rip U.S.-citizen
children from their parents.
The President’s assault on immi-
grants goes well beyond the border. It
is terrorizing those all around us for
nothing other than political gain.
Blatant suppression of votes and in-
timidation of communities across the
land: Recent news that the Census will
be printed without the citizenship
question is a victory for everyone in
this country. This is especially impor-
tant for historically undercounted
groups, including communities of
color, people living in large housing
units, and immigrants.
Every single person in our democracy
counts and must be counted in the Cen-
sus to distribute Federal funding and
resources accurately. The Constitution
is clear on this topic. The final Census
count determines so much of our daily
lives: new hospitals and schools, rep-
resentation in government, funding
programs like Medicaid. Ensuring ev-
eryone counts ensures funding for the
programs our constituents need and for
healthy neighborhoods.
Recently released documents have
proven what we already suspected, that
the Trump administration announced
the addition of a citizenship question
in yet another attempt to disenfran-
chise and intimidate the immigrant
community. It was a cheap political
move to undermine the integrity of the
Census.
Is this person a citizen of the United
States? A seemingly small question,
but one with so many implications.
This is especially true for children, in-
cluding U.S.-citizen children living in
mixed-status families, families that
might avoid the Census for fear of their
information being shared.
Our fight to count every single per-
son is not over. We still have a lot of
work ahead of us.
The back-and-forth of the citizenship
question left many of my constituents
scared and confused. This remains the
administration’s goal.
While President Trump has backed
down from his attempt to add a citizen-
ship question to the Census, he is di-
recting U.S. agencies to provide all in-
formation they have on U.S. citizen-
ship. In other words, he continues to
use any means of intimidation to
threaten immigrants. When one meth-
od is blocked, he tries another.
Ensuring a complete count on the
2020 Census is a fight we can win. I
started working on it as a Cook County
commissioner and will continue work-
ing to ensure that every single person
is counted. Our representation, schools,
hospitals, and healthcare depend on it.
The President continues to
weaponize his office in every possible
way. We must fight back until we have
justice for all and justice for immi-
grants.
Madam Speaker, today, we have
heard powerful stories and comments
from my colleagues from all around the
country about the countless ways that
President Trump is driving an anti-im-
migrant agenda and terrorizing com-
munities all around the country,
whether it is the detention of Amer-
ican citizens, Trump ending asylum
protections and eligibility, changes to
the citizenship test, placing children in
cages to send a message, or leaving
women and children in inhumane con-
ditions at detention camps.
We must remember that this admin-
istration is not only hurting immi-
grants, but it is hurting citizens,
mixed-status families, and entire com-
munities, Black, White, Asian, and
Latino.
These harmful tactics may be aimed
at a few, but they are harming us all.
b 1900
Trump’s assault on immigrants and
asylum seekers is an assault on all
Americans, an assault on our values of
inclusivity, an assault on our history
of welcoming the world’s tired and
weary. He is leading a full-court press
on the very soul of who we are as
Americans.
Deeply disturbing is the fact that we
know that Trump’s ongoing attacks on
immigrants are deeply rooted in rac-
ism. We see it in the Muslim ban, we
see it in the 2020 census citizenship
question, and the public charge rule.
Trump says that criminals, drug deal-
ers, and rapists are invading our coun-
try casting a generalization over com-
munities all over the land. That is
false. It is the reason he wants fewer
immigrants from s-hole countries and
more from northern European coun-
tries like Norway, or so he has said.
When a crowd chanted recently
‘‘Send her back’’ in response to
Trump’s attacks against my col-
leagues, we knew it was never about
legal immigration. As an immigrant, I
take this personally.
When the President announced ICE
raids, we know his intent was to delib-
erately terrorize Black, Brown, and im-
migrant communities.
Livelihoods and families are at stake
and many in the communities, like the
ones I represent, were thrown into fear
and trauma when the President threat-
ened raids over Twitter.
Parents today are forced to have
tough conversations with their chil-
dren to set up emergency plans in the
event they would not return home from
work. This is sad and tragic.
While the President continues to at-
tack immigrants and asylum seekers, I
remind my constituents that this is
not the time to be fearful or timid, this
is the time to keep fighting, to act like
courageous Americans, and those who
aspire to be Americans, as well.
We are a nation of many peoples and
certainly of immigrants. America is
and has been great, precisely because
we have long welcomed immigrants
with open arms and will continue doing
so. To be American is to be of immi-
grant heritage, with the exception of
our Native American sisters and broth-
ers, all of whom have also suffered be-
cause of tactics to divide us by race, by
creed, or by country of origin.
Together, we are stronger than this
President. And no matter how long this
assault on immigrants and asylum
seekers goes on, it is in our blood, as
Americans, to never lose faith in the
fight for equal human dignity and op-
portunity for all. We must fight until
there is justice for all and justice for
immigrants in America.
If we are talking about Trump’s as-
sault on immigrants, we cannot leave
out what the President has done to
Dreamers. At the beginning of his ad-
ministration, the President rescinded
DACA under the authority of then-At-
torney General Jeff Sessions. That ac-
tion was the opening salvo in President
Trump’s assault on immigrants using
the power of the Oval Office.
The decision to end DACA and the
DACA program was a direct attack on
young men and women, all of whom
were brought into this country through
no decision of their own. Many came as
babies.
Many DACA recipients or Dreamers
call no other country but America
their home. Unfortunately, they have
to work harder than anyone else to
have access to the same opportunities
afforded to their friends and classmates
in the same country that we all love.
That is the case of Elizeth Arguelles,
a 23-year-old Dreamer from my dis-
trict. She is also from my neighbor-
hood of Little Village in Chicago.
Elizeth is paying her way through col-
lege by making and selling tamales.
At age 9, she learned to make
tamales and started helping her moth-
er sell them in the streets of Chicago.
Since elementary school, she has been
waking up at 3:30 in the morning to
make the tamales before going out to
sell them at 7:30.
Elizeth will graduate from college
next year, and we could say her story is
a hallmark of success and American
perseverance. Saying so, however, ig-
nores the dark reality of her situation.
Her story is, by all means, a picture-
perfect example of America’s spirit and
hard work and perseverance. She de-
serves that credit.
Her story, however, is far from a feel-
good story. Rather, it is yet another
example of how our political system
has failed hardworking people in our
country.
Elizeth’s success is hers alone. Our
government has and continues to fail
her by maintaining an anti-immigrant
policy that fails to account for children

brought here against their own con-
scious will.
It is a reminder that the Dream and
Promise Act passed in the House of
Representatives must be passed in the
Senate immediately. Up to 2.5 million
immigrants across the country, people
like Elizeth, would be eligible for pro-
tection under H. Res. 6, including 37,000
immigrants in Chicago alone.
Through the Dream and Promise Act,
Elizeth and her family and over 85,000
people in my city who live in mixed-
status families would have legal cer-
tainty.
I applaud Elizeth’s perseverance and
determination to fulfill her dream of
graduating from a 4-year university.
But I also hope that the Members of
the Senate are hearing the cries of as-
piring young Americans who want to
continue to contribute to our country,
to lead our country, and to be exem-
plary citizens by giving them a path to
legalization and citizenship.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON
LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
first, I would like to congratulate the
gentleman from Illinois, Congressman
GARCÍA, not only for his legacy and
leadership here in the United States
Congress, but really for the work of
reconciliation and friendship in the
great city of Chicago, working with so
many different groups and under-
standing the myriad of issues dealing
with immigrants.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to, first
of all, say to my fellow Americans—
that was something utilized by Presi-
dent Lyndon Baines Johnson. And I
would think that, as he said it many,
many years ago, America was less di-
verse—I use it now, because I think it
is important in a Nation that is enor-
mously diverse, that we, in fact, use
the words ‘‘fellow Americans,’’ so that
we cannot pit one group of Americans
against another, these immigrants
against those who are here, or those
who have been immigrants that have
come and now have either gotten sta-
tus or been here for a long time. Let us
not let the administration pit one
American against another. We are, in
fact, really our brothers’ and sisters’
keeper.
When I think of immigrants, I think
of every single person who has come to
this Nation. They have come in many
different colors and in many different
eras. Yes, Native Americans were al-
ready here. Yes, African Americans
came as slaves. But then, as the years
passed, there were people of African de-
scent who came as immigrants. There
were Irish and Italians, there were peo-
ple from Britain and Germany, and
there were people from South Asia,
Asia, and Asia Pacific. And, of course,
there are those who have now come
from the southern border.
Why do we have the right to be able
to demonize individuals who have come
in a recent time, individuals who sim-
ply want an opportunity to work, to
contribute, and, yes, to put on the uni-
form?
I am reminded of Captain Khan and
his wonderful family. Captain Khan
was a Pakistani who died in the recent
war in Iraq. He came here to this coun-
try. His family came here to this coun-
try.
So, I join with my colleague to say
that we must pass comprehensive im-
migration reform, but we must pass
the legislation that includes the Amer-
ican Dream and Promise Act. We must
recognize that we have to confront the
issue of dealing with the treatment of
those who have come most recently.
How do we deny it, when those of us
who have been to the border, for exam-
ple, literally talked to persons who
have said they watched their father
being beat to death and they watched
as the MS–13, who are wanted in that
country, come to make them a mem-
ber? How are you going to challenge
that?
How do you challenge a woman who
got on the road and had her baby on
the road because people in the neigh-
borhood said she owed them money and
they were going to kill her?
How do you answer an aunt who went
to the store and came back and found
all of her nieces and nephews drugged
and individuals in the house and all
they had to do was escape for their
life?
So, I believe that standing here today
is recognizing that there must be a so-
lution.
Let me share with you just some of
the comments from a hearing that we
had on the oversight of family separa-
tion and CBP short-term custody under
the Trump administration.
In March 2017, former Secretary of
Homeland Security John Kelly an-
nounced that DHS was considering a
proposal to separate families at the
southern border as a means of deter-
ring migration. And that is what they
did.
Today, it was indicated that they had
not reunited every one of those chil-
dren that had been separated. Who of
us in America would welcome the idea
of children being snatched from you?
You wanted that child. This wasn’t a
situation of abuse. And then you come
to find out they could not find you or
find your child to reunite.
In a September 2018 report, the DHS
Inspector General found that DHS was
not fully prepared to implement the
administration’s zero-tolerance policy
or to deal with some of its aftereffects.
Can you imagine that? They just didn’t
have the facilities to deal with this
very detrimental policy.
What about asylum? That is inter-
national law. That is a law that allows
individuals fleeing persecution to come
to any country and seek asylum under
their laws. Under our law, if you are in
credible fear, you could seek asylum.
Those administrations that were rea-
sonable recognized that domestic vio-
lence could be taken into consider-
ation.
But let us realize where we are: The
Trump administration eliminated do-
mestic violence right out and then
wanted to eliminate the rights of those
individuals to file for asylum. Just re-
cently, a lawsuit said, no, Mr. Presi-
dent, you cannot do that. You cannot
do that and deny the rights under
international law and national law for
these individuals to be able to use the
process that has been granted to so
many before them.
And then, of course, this report from
the Office of Inspector General that—in
actuality, a report was made public on
July 2, though it was given to the De-
partment of Homeland Security much
earlier than that, but I think this was
a report on the CBP and BP facilities
at the border. Let me recognize, of
course, the need to provide resources.
We voted on a $4.6 billion appropria-
tions at the beginning of July to be
able to help and to provide better re-
sources. But one of the things that was
said to the Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity: ‘‘DHS needs to address dan-
gerous overcrowding among single
adults at El Paso Del Norte processing
center.’’
And: ‘‘DHS needs to address dan-
gerous overcrowding and prolonged de-
tention of children and adults in the
Rio Grande Valley.’’
This is not SHEILA JACKSON LEE or
Congressman GARCÍA, this is the De-
partment of Homeland Security Inspec-
tor General’s report.
We are, in fact, our brothers’ and sis-
ters’ keeper. We are many colors as im-
migrants. Africans are coming across
the border, fleeing for their lives, seek-
ing relief.
All we have to do is to follow our
laws to allow the asylum process to
proceed and those individuals to be
rendered a judgment that they can
stay or not stay. And then to use our
refugee resettlement and our humani-
tarian agencies to either help settle
them in the United States or resettle
them as they go back out of the United
States.
There’s also the possibility of having
an agreement that after their asylum
has failed, if it does, that they can re-
main with opportunities in Mexico,
which was originally spoken about.
But since I have been to the place in
Mexico where the policies of the Presi-
dent are to keep them in Mexico, I can
tell you that Mexico at the border does
not have the resources, does not have
the housing, and does not have the jobs
to take care of those individuals who
are there.

Madam Speaker, I want to make it
very clear, as I started out, my fellow
Americans, on this floor, this par-
ticular Democratic Congress in the ma-
jority has recognized the importance of

down prescription drugs costs, to pro-
tect against eliminating preexisting
conditions, and to bring down insur-
ance costs. We just passed the historic

$15-an-hour wage increase as Federal
law. We are working on gun safety.
We are working on issues dealing
with Americans. But we must call our
higher angels and recognize the respon-
sibility of this Nation to address the
concerns of its people.
So, as I conclude my remarks, let me
say that I hope that we will be able to
work together on the 9,000 children who
are held by the Department of Health
and Human Services in what we call
shelters, and to realize or to state—let
me state it publicly to Health and
Human Services, whom I worked with
on the Obama administration—that
these shelters do not belong to Health
and Human Services. They belong to
the people of the United States, funded
with taxpayer dollars, and that means
the Members of the United States Con-
gress.
No Member of Congress should be
blocked from going into these facili-
ties. No Member of Congress should be
blocked from talking to these young
people who want to talk to them and
tell them that they have been in these
centers for 3 months, 100 days. They
are not supposed to be there that long.
There needs to be a system put in place
to expedite these youngsters. One
youngster wants to go back home to
Mexico. He is still there.
So I want to put Health and Human
Services on notice not to block any of
us from coming in, facilitating how we
are to interact with these young peo-
ple, to provide them comfort and un-
derstanding of how we can move their
cases along—not pull them out, not
break the law, not disrespect the sys-
tem, but to help the system, over-
loaded, choked down, not concerned, to
move forward on behalf of these young
people.
I thank Congressman GARCÍA for giv-
ing me the opportunity to share some
of my thoughts about how we have to
fix the broken immigration system,
which includes recognizing that many
people who are here working, paying
taxes, paying a mortgage, have come
here through no fault of their own, and,
as well, their families, who are here
seeking opportunity.
I believe that, together, in a bipar-
tisan manner, we could really do this,
as we have done for immigrants who
have come to this country in the 1800s
and the 1900s, and they have now inte-
grated into our society.
Let me thank the gentleman so much
for his leadership on this.
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I thank Congresswoman JACK-
SON LEE for her words.
To close this evening, I want to call
our attention again to what we are
seeking to do in this Special Order
hour, which is to again highlight and
shed a spotlight on the administra-
tion’s assault on immigration and asy-
lum seekers that is taking place.
I do it seeking to express the senti-
ment, the concerns, and the aspirations
of, especially, immigrant groups in my
district whom I represent.
And who are they? They are people
who have come from Asia, who have
come from Germany, who have come
from Ireland, who have come from
Eastern Europe, who have come from
Africa and the Caribbean, as well as
Latin America, and even other coun-
tries.
It is my hope that, as the House of
Representatives begins its summer re-
cess, this Congress and the White
House will reflect on the Nation’s great
history of welcoming people who are
fleeing oppression and, as Congress-
woman JACKSON LEE noted, that we
allow our better angels to impact, to
inspire, and to move us.
As we continue our path, striving to
become a more perfect Union, there
isn’t a better way forward than by em-
bracing those who are fleeing persecu-
tion, those who are fleeing violence,
and those who are fleeing terrible con-
ditions in the countries that they were
born in.
I want to thank the Congressional
Progressive Caucus for its assistance in
arranging for this Special Order hour. I
want to thank those who have joined
me tonight to share their stories.
Madam Speaker, we can and we must
do better.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I yield back the balance of
my time.
f
ISSUES OF THE DAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. YOHO) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority
leader.
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I have a
three-part series, and I would like to
open at this moment and yield to the
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
PERRY), my good friend.
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Florida for
offering me just a moment to talk
about something that is very impor-
tant to me.
Madam Speaker, I rise today at a
time when the United States and the
international community must step up
efforts to combat money laundering.
Money laundering is a critical source
of funding for terrorist organizations
and drug cartels like the ones that my
good friend from Florida might be
talking about tonight. These are drug
cartels and other organized crime
rings. It is used to disguise profits from
or financing for illicit activity.
Money is moved in a variety of ways
across borders and through the global
financial markets to evade detection
by law enforcement—global financial
markets just like ours. While exact
numbers can’t be determined, esti-
mates suggest that annual sums of
money laundering are in the trillions
of dollars—trillions.
Money laundering facilitates a broad
range of serious underlying crimes, in-
cluding the financing of North Korea’s
and Iran’s nuclear proliferation net-
works and the activities of terrorist
operations. Money laundering also
plays a significant role in drug, human,
and wildlife trafficking.
In today’s world, money launderers
rely on both new and old methods. The
crime is conducted through shell com-
panies, bulk cash smuggling, gambling,
cyber-related methods, and invest-
ments in mobile commodities, includ-
ing things that you might not think
about, like gems and real estate—yes,
real estate.
For example, we have recently seen a
rise in money laundering through lux-
ury real estate purchases. Some people
come to me and say there is a housing
crisis. Well, when money launderers
are inflating the cost of housing by
laundering money through overpaying
for a property, that is a problem for
vulnerable populations in the United
States. These real estate purchases
happen in major U.S. cities as well as
international cities like London and
Dubai.
Madam Speaker, money laundering
threatens political stability, democ-
racy, and free markets around the
globe, and we must take steps to
counter it right now.
I thank the gentleman from Florida
for yielding to me.
HONORING THE MEMORY OF ROSEWOOD
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I am en-
tering into the second phase of my Spe-
cial Order.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the memory of Rosewood and re-
flect upon the tragedy that happened
in 1923.
Rosewood was a small, rural town in
my district. It is in northwest central
Florida, in between Otter Creek,
Chiefland, and Cedar Key. It was built
around the pencil mill and turpentine
industry. It was a mixed town of
Blacks and Whites.
In 1915, it had a population of ap-
proximately 355 people. The town had
started to become segregated. The
neighboring town of Sumner was devel-
oped at the time and was primarily
White.
In January of 1923, a young White
woman claimed that a Black man had
assaulted her. The accusation started a
riot, ultimately resulting in the burn-
ing of the entire town and the death of
countless members of the Rosewood
community.
Within hours of the violence starting,
many survivors fled to the surrounding
woods, where they hid and waited for a
rescue train that was sent there to
take people out of the area of violence.
At the end of the week, only one
building remained standing, and to this
day, the death toll is still unknown,
and no buildings remain.
The story by the young White woman
was found to be a lie. She was the
Black man’s lover. Her significant
other beat her, and she lied and blamed
the young Black man to save face.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7452 July 25, 2019
The Rosewood massacre, which oc-
curred just outside of my district, is
one that went nearly forgotten for over
60 years because of the destructive na-
ture of prejudice and hatred caused by
the survivors who lived in fear, rarely
sharing their stories, even with fami-
lies and close friends.
I firmly believe that in order to learn
from our history, we have to make an
effort to remember it. We should me-
morialize these events, and that is why
we put up plaques. We put up markers
or statues, lest we forget it, and within
a generation or two, the mistakes of
the past are repeated because the next
generation will grow ignorant of the
struggles of the past.
When the stories of Rosewood first
started recirculating in the 1980s, it
brought in a new level of awareness to
the State of Florida and the under-
standing that we, as a society, cannot
be complacent in senseless acts of vio-
lence. It even inspired a movie in Hol-
lywood to illustrate the ugliness of the
past hatred and the violence.
Violence and prejudice have no place
in our society, and we have a duty to
ensure that this type of tragedy never
happens again.
Today, in Rosewood, a marker stands
just off the highway memorializing the
town that never returned. Survivors
and their descendants have shared
their stories, hoping that Rosewood’s
memory would not be erased.
One of these is a constituent of mine,
Ms. Lizzie Jenkins, who has been work-
ing on this tragedy for the last 25
years. Her goal and ours is for individ-
uals to remember and to never forget
the hatred, the racism of the past, and
to honor those who suffered in the past
so future generations do not repeat the
pain, suffering, and mistakes of the
past.
She has a dream to accomplish this,
and that is to create the Rosewood Mu-
seum.
Madam Speaker, it has been almost a
century since the Rosewood massacre.
By remembering and learning from this
tragedy, we can work towards a future
full of acceptance. Knowing Ms. Jen-
kins, I can confidently say that there
will be a Rosewood Museum.
SOLVING THE PROBLEM AT THE SOUTHWEST
BORDER
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I would
like to move on to the third portion of
my Special Order. We are going to talk
about how to solve the problem at the
southwest border and how to move be-
yond border security.
I just listened to an hour of people
ranting and putting blame on this
President for the hatred, the racism he
has caused. I heard the Member on the
other side talk about the ban on Mus-
lims.
We can’t move forward and fix things
if we use false narratives. There was
not a ban on Muslims. President
Trump put a ban on countries. In fact,
they are the same six countries that
President Obama put a ban on and rec-
ommended to put a ban on. There was
never a ban on Muslim countries.
I went to Indonesia on a codel, a bi-
partisan one, and there was a Member
of this Congress from the other side
who asked the Indonesian Prime Min-
ister at the time: What is the senti-
ment in a Muslim country about a ban
from our President—President Trump
at the time—about the Muslim ban
that he has placed on there?
He knew good and well that Presi-
dent Trump didn’t ban Muslims in this
country. He put the ban on the same
six countries that President Obama
did, but there was no complaint.
I bring that up just because, if we are
going to solve the problems of this
country, one that this body—look at it.
It is empty. There are two Members of
Congress in here, and they have been
complaining—I am sorry. I stand cor-
rected, Madam Speaker. There are
three Members of Congress.
But if we are going to fix this prob-
lem, it is going to take more than
three of us. I am sure everyone agrees.
They sit there and they give great
speeches about how it is tearing our
country apart. The President is tearing
our country apart. What a shame this
is, the hatred, the vitriol that is com-
ing out of the White House, how people
are being taken away from their fami-
lies, and there are no toothbrushes or
diapers, or they are sleeping on floors.
I am just glad the other side is ac-
knowledging that there is a crisis, but
for the first half of the year, there
wasn’t a crisis. They refused to say
there was a crisis.
There was a Special Order here last
week, and my good colleague, Mr.
KING, was here. We had other Members,
and we had pictures from 2014 when
President Obama was here. It was
funny because my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle were railing
about the crisis in 2014.
b 1930
There have been times in this body
when the Democrats had the majority
in the House, the Senate, and the
White House. There were times, and I
was there, when the Republicans had
the same majority, the House, the Sen-
ate, and the White House.
It saddens me because this discussion
about our having to fix these things,
when both parties were in control, they
didn’t do it. What really saddens me is
I see people using political opportuni-
ties for their next election. I heard a
lot of that tonight. There were no solu-
tions in that.
We talked for an hour last week
about the crisis at the border, the situ-
ation at the border, and the atrocities
at the border. The drug cartels are
profiting from this. We stay as a di-
vided House. I implored President
Trump—and I will do it again tonight—
that he needs to call Congress back in
session when we reconvene tomorrow,
and I would do it every time this body
goes on a break until we fix our border
security and until we come up with an
immigration bill.
I want to move into what I really
want to talk about. In order to move
forward, we have to have solutions. I
have been here for 7 years, and I have
seen ‘‘comprehensive’’ come up in
healthcare, and I have seen ‘‘com-
prehensive’’ come up in immigration.
What I have learned is that when you
put ‘‘comprehensive’’ in front of a
cause, it doesn’t happen. It is political
speak that says it is not going to hap-
pen because the room becomes divided,
and everybody uses it as a political
tool for the next election.
What I want to do is, instead of try-
ing to do comprehensive immigration
reform, I want to focus on a small bite
of the apple.
We have a proposal. We have legisla-
tion that we are working through the
House in a bipartisan manner. We have
shared this with over 40 Members of
Congress in a bipartisan manner, and
we have shared this with the Senate in
a bipartisan manner. It is a guest
worker program.
The bill will be a guest worker pro-
gram. There will be three silos, agri-
culture, hospitality, and construction.
These are all positions that, in general,
are in the lower-skilled fields. They are
not rocket scientists, and they are not
engineers. These are the skills that we
need in our labor workforce for agri-
culture, for food security, for construc-
tion, and for our hospitality. In the
past, we have not had a good program
for people to come into the country le-
gally and stay in the field that they
have decided to work in.
This bill will be under a banner, but
there will be three separate bills. The
first bill will be a guest worker pro-
gram for agriculture, and that is what
I would like to focus on tonight.
America has the lowest-cost food of
the industrialized world because our
farmers can produce so well. But they
can’t benefit from that if we don’t have
the workers willing to go out and work
in the fields.
I was a person who, at the age of 15,
worked in produce. We loaded trucks.
The produce came in from the farm,
and we loaded the produce. I did that
to work my way through college. Yet,
today, people said that domestic peo-
ple, Americans, won’t do that work. I
disagree with that, and I think we put
a stigma on that.
In order to fix this, we have to have
a labor solution, or our farmers won’t
be able to keep farming. The goal of
this bill is to create a dependable, reli-
able workforce. The way this program
would work is it would be in two
phases.
The first phase is that we create a
prescreened pool of workers before they
come into the country. We will have a
relationship and an agreement between
country A and our State Department.
If we pick out a country, Guatemala,
the Guatemalan state department will
have a relationship with our State De-
partment. When a person applies, he
becomes what we call the applicant.
The country he comes from will verify
the person’s date of birth and their res-
idence. Then, they will verify that this

person has not been involved in violent
crimes, drug activity, or gang activity.
Once they apply, that information
goes through the Department of Home-
land Security. They do a background
check. They do it on their inter-
national database, and they do it on
the domestic database. If that person
clears the database, then that informa-
tion goes to the USDA. We moved the
agriculture labor workforce from the
Department of Labor to the USDA,
where it can be better monitored to
fulfill the needs of agriculture.
That person does not come into the
country until a job is open. The em-
ployer in this country, an agriculture
producer, still has to advertise for do-
mestic help. When that position is not
filled, the producer can ask for that
worker to come in. That worker comes
in under the agreement that they are
going to work in the agriculture sec-
tor.
They have to be a minimum of 18
years of age. It is not chain migration.
If they have family members who want
to come in, they, too, can apply, but it
applies to them individually.
Once they get accepted into the pro-
gram and come into the country, they
become a participant. At that time,
they get issued a guest worker identi-
fication card that we call a GWIC card.
That GWIC card will have 15 digits in
there for security. In addition, it will
have the initials ‘‘AG,’’ designating
that that is an agriculture worker per-
mit.
When the worker comes in, they now
have been allowed into the country le-
gally. The work permit goes on for 5
years. That means they can stay in
this country for 5 years at a time. They
have to work a minimum of 75 percent
of the year in agriculture, but it allows
them to move back and forth to their
host country seamlessly because we
have an agreement between two coun-
tries.
The person can travel around the
country to work a seasonal crop. In
Florida, our citrus harvest is done usu-
ally by mid- to late June. That would
allow that worker to go from that farm
up to New York, Maine, or Washington
State to work crops. He also has the
ability to go back home.
That permit is good for 5 years at a
time. He can renew 41⁄2 years into it,
and he can do this indefinitely. There
will be a cutoff age. We are recom-
mending approximately 50 or 55 years
of age. There is a fee of $2,500 for that.
The second part of this program will
be dealing with the people here who
came in illegally. Our proposal would
allow a person to apply to this program
under the understanding that the Fed-
eral Government is not here to deport
them. The Federal Government is here
to give them a way that they can get
into a program and have legal resi-
dence here.
During that period of time, when the
applicant is applying, there will be a
waiver over that person, meaning that
he won’t be deported. A background
check will be done. If DHS says this
person is okay, then he can enter this
program. If that person has minor vio-
lations—a fender bender, didn’t return
a book to the library—he will have a
period of time where he can get
straight with the legal system.
Upon completing that, he enters into
the guest worker program and becomes
a participant. He, too, pays a fee of
$2,500. That is to go for running the
program. In addition, there will be a
fine for coming into the country ille-
gally. What has been proposed is ap-
proximately $1,500 to $2,000 for the first
time they apply to the program.
Every year a person renews, 41⁄2 years
into this program, there will be a $2,500
fee, and that is subject to change as
the times change.
As a person comes into the program,
they get issued the guest worker iden-
tification card, which is called the
GWIC card, and that will be embedded
biometrics. We gave the list to the
DHS to pick out what they think is
necessary from facial recognition pic-
tures, DNA, fingerprints, and retinal
scans, all that they can choose from.
We asked them to put enough of those
biometrics in there so that card is se-
cure.
In addition, it will have a 15-digit
code that will be a hack-proof, secure
card. As I said, there will be the ini-
tials ‘‘AG,’’ designating that person as
a guest worker in this country in agri-
culture.
He is allowed to get a driver’s li-
cense. If he passes the test in a State,
then he will get a guest worker driver’s
license. It would not be used for voter
registration. It is something to give
that person a driver’s license so that he
can work on a farm.
If that person who is here illegally
gets accepted into the program and has
a family who came in with him ille-
gally, as he is applying to the program,
there is a waiver over his family. If he
gets accepted into the program, or they
get accepted into the program, his fam-
ily is also good to stay in the country
for 5 years at a time, provided the par-
ticipant renews 41⁄2 years into it.
If his children came in illegally, then
they are protected until the age of 18,
at which time they have to make a de-
cision to apply to one of the programs.
There will be three sectors. It will be
agriculture, hospitality, and construc-
tion.
At that point, again, as I said, that
person can move around the country.
They can work crops wherever they
choose. They can go back home know-
ing they can get back into this coun-
try.
E-Verify will be a component of this,
and it would work such that, as a per-
son enters the program, their data is
already in DHS. When they go to start
their job, the employer puts their
smart card, the GWIC card, into a read-
er. It identifies the person, a positive
identification. We have eliminated
probably close to 100 percent of the
fraud that occurs with the current sys-
tem.
We request that the individual work-
er has to check into a Federal office on
a monthly basis. Every town in Amer-
ica has a Federal office, either a court-
house or a post office. Part of the $2,500
fee goes to pay for the equipment in
there. It would be inexpensive equip-
ment. It would be the same equipment
that we use when we go to do a retail
sale like at a big box store. You put
your card in there; it reads it; and it
tells DHS and USDA where this person
is.
The employer also is required to use
E-Verify. This will be seamless because
he is pulling people out of a pool who
are already prescreened and who are in
the E-Verify system. They go through
this system.
E-Verify will become mandatory
once we get 75 to 80 percent of the ex-
pected population that we need in our
guest worker fields. At that point, all
employers will be using the E-Verify
system.
The beauty of this system is that we
have given a portal for people to come
into this country legally. We have
given them a way to stay in this coun-
try for up to 5 years at a time. Then,
we give them a way that we can mon-
itor bad players who sneak into the
country or employers who are hiring
people here illegally that suppresses
the wages of domestic workers.
If an employer hires people outside of
the system once it is mandatory, when
they get caught, it is a $2,500 fee the
first offense, per offense per individual.
If it is a repeat offender of an em-
ployer, then that fine will go up, and
they are subject to jail time.
The beauty of this is if a worker
leaves a guest worker program in ei-
ther agriculture, hospitality, or con-
struction, and they try to work in a
different sector and are found out by
the people who are doing the inspec-
tion, they have given up their right to
stay in this country on a guest worker
program.
The things that we hear back about
that is that people voluntarily enter
this program. They have agreed to
work in agriculture and agriculture
only or one of the other sectors. If they
work outside of that, they have agreed
that they have broken that. This is a
policy that is self-policing when people
get found out.
For the people who choose not to
enter any of these programs, they are
here illegally, and they will be dealt
with according to the laws on the
books.
We are asking to have sequencing
done on this, and the first part of that
is we have to agree on border security.
It is interesting because I hear this
fight over border security, but when I
go on trips and talk to my colleagues
on the other side, they always tell me
that they agree with border security
and that we have to have border secu-
rity. If we agree to it, let’s do it.
Again, this body is empty other than
us three. I think the President should
call us back. Let’s get border security.

Let’s get this done, Madam Speaker, so
that we can move on to the next thing.
We have to have enforcement of the
laws on the books. We are providing a
guest worker program for the majority
of the people whom we need in our
labor force for lower skills.
The third part of the sequencing is
that we can deal with Dreamers and
DACA down the road. We can’t do that
until we do border security and have a
way for people to come into the coun-
try legally, to work in this country le-
gally, and to take that group who came
in illegally and put them in a legal
process.
Madam Speaker, this is something
we have shared with probably close to
60 people in a bipartisan manner. We
have shared this with agriculture
groups from all over the Nation, from
California to Maine, New York, Wash-
ington State, Florida, Minnesota, and
North Dakota, and from every sector in
agriculture, from dairy to pine, timber,
fruits and vegetables, citrus, and fruits
and nuts. Everybody tells us this is the
most commonsense reform they have
seen.
We have shared it with ranking mem-
bers of different committees on the
Democratic side. They said this is
something they plan to help support. I
am excited because of the bipartisan
nature in the House. We have shared
this with Senators, and the Senators
are working with us to make this hap-
pen. Our goal is to make this happen
this Congress.
We are looking for people to go to
our website, https://yoho.house.gov, to
get more information. We have a short
video that covers this.
If we do nothing, we are going to
have a repeat of the last 30, 35 years,
when Ronald Reagan gave amnesty to
3.5 million to 4 million people.
b 1945
This body has sat there and argued
and blamed the other side for inaction
or blamed the other side for hatred and
racism or blamed the other side for
wanting to give everybody amnesty. If
we do nothing, this problem will grow
and grow and divide this Nation more.
This is the time to act, and I would
hope people would come back to Con-
gress over the break and let’s get some-
thing done.
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the op-
portunity to be here. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Iowa (Mr. KING), my good
friend, to say something.
Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr.
YOHO) for yielding to me, and I appre-
ciate very much the work that is done
by Dr. TED YOHO here in this Congress.
I would like to have the Members
know, Madam Speaker, that TED YOHO
gets up every day and grinds away with
an eye towards making America great
again and putting us in the right place.
And I recall a meeting that he called
together here, kind of an off-campus
meeting about how we are going to
save America from a Congress that
doesn’t seem to want to look to the ho-
rizon, let alone over the horizon.
There is a lot of common sense that
has been put together in this immigra-
tion policy, and I want to carefully
evaluate all of the components of it. I
know that we are in discussions right
now about how it might even be im-
proved a little bit, but I am open to
this discussion, and I think he has
brought up some very important
points.
I will add one that I hope can be in-
corporated into this, to take the E-
verify mandatory piece of this and ex-
pand it into a bill that I have had be-
fore this Congress a number of years. It
is called the New IDEA Act, and it
would work actually seamlessly with
what has been described here tonight
in that I incorporate the language in
it, which is this:
When an employer—we put together
a committee, a three-way team, the
IRS, the Social Security Administra-
tion, the Department of Homeland Se-
curity, and require them to work to-
gether for the cause of enforcing immi-
gration law and, in addition to the pen-
alties that have been suggested here,
deny the deductibility of wages and
benefits paid to illegals.
I would give the employer safe harbor
if they use E-verify, but if they are
then using illegal labor, the IRS, in a
normal audit, not an accelerated audit,
then would come in, run the Social Se-
curity numbers and identifying infor-
mation of the employees who are listed
in the tax forms through the E-verify
program.
If they can’t be verified, the IRS then
could deduct the wages and benefits
paid to them, remove it as a business
expense, which puts those dollars,
wages, and benefits paid to illegals into
the gross receipts where they show up
as net income. That makes it taxable.
When we first did this math, it would
be, if you would take a $10-an-hour ille-
gal and deny the deductibility of that
under the old tax policy, it would take
us to a $16-an-hour illegal. We also
would have interest and penalty, and
there is a 6-year statute of limitations.
Madam Speaker, I got to this conclu-
sion by asking the question: What
agency, what department is most re-
spected, and maybe even most feared,
by the American people?
Since I have been drug through au-
dits a few too many times, I will tell
you that the business people, the em-
ployers in this country, they don’t
want the IRS looking into their books,
and they don’t see that they can nego-
tiate much of a compromise with the
IRS.
So I think giving a 6-year statute of
limitations on that, you accumulate
that liability, and it makes it far more
likely that employers will voluntarily
go in and clean up their workforce.
That is something that, had that been
done years ago, we wouldn’t be in the
situation we are in today.
The labor situation that we have, it
is a bit more complex down in the
southern part of the United States
than it is up in the heart of the heart-
land where I am. And that is that we
seem to be able to find the people to
climb in the tractor, in the combine, or
in the trucks and get our crops in the
ground; we get them back out again;
and it is a little smoother up that way.
The labor situations that we see in
places like Florida and California and
Arizona, all those States, and many
more in particular, that is a different
kind of a situation.
What I would suggest, though, is that
temporary workers be required to be
bonded. I introduced legislation to do
that, and I hope that is something we
can discuss, as well, is incorporating it
into this proposal.
I pointed that out to the President in
a meeting in the Oval Office sometime
back. He seemed to respond very favor-
ably to that suggestion. I pointed out
that he actually has the authority to
go forward with a bonding program
now. And so I noticed that, a few weeks
later, he issued an order that directed
the executive branch to do the research
and put the pieces together so that
they can activate a bonding program.
But think of it this way: Whether
you are going to be a guest worker in
the United States or a visitor to the
United States, you need a visa to come
to America to do that.
So when you apply for that visa, you
post your credit card, just as if you
walked into a hotel and they say: Your
room is paid for, but we need a credit
card so we can hold for any incidentals
that might come.
You post that credit card on your
visa application to temporarily come
to America, and if you go back under
the terms of the visa, then, fine, the
hold is released on that credit card; but
if you overstay your visa, then that
credit card is charged for that fee, and
that fee goes into an enforcement fund
in order to enforce the immigration
laws we have in this country.
We need the rule of law restored in
the United States of America. No
place, in all of our law, is it less re-
spected than it is in immigration law.
And as I listened to some of the rhet-
oric over here on the floor tonight, it
still is breathtaking to hear how inten-
tionally the terms ‘‘legal’’ and ‘‘ille-
gal’’ immigrant are conflated so that
the very meritorious legal immigrant
who respects our laws, that meri-
torious legal immigrant is conflated
into the same term with the one who
has disrespected our laws. The one who
has disrespected our laws gets assigned
the same merit that exists for those
who respect our laws and want to come
to America for an opportunity to suc-
ceed and to prosper.
But I make another point, Madam
Speaker, that I don’t hear in this dia-
logue on immigration, and that is that
America has a unique vigor. We have a
unique vitality. We have a can-do spir-
it. And a lot of that vitality, vigor, and
can-do spirit comes from the legal im-
migrants who have had the aspiration
to come to America.

And I would say that, if there is a
family of 10 siblings, boys and girls to-
gether, if one of them has the ambition
and the eagerness to respect our laws
and come to the United States, the one
who chooses to self-select to come here
is going to be the one in that family
who has the most ambition, the most
vigor.
That is one of the reasons why Amer-
ica is a can-do country, because we
have gotten that quality of people who
self-selected as legal immigrants to
come to America.
So I appreciate the gentleman’s work
on the immigration policy, and I look
forward to examining all of the lan-
guage there and have an open dialogue
on this. But I also applaud the very
diligent effort that has gone forth on
this issue and many others.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from Florida for yielding.
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING),
for the things he stands for. He is just
a true patriot who loves America.
The gentleman brought up a great
point. The current system allows peo-
ple to use the Social Security number.
So you can come into the country. You
get issued a Social Security, or people
will eventually, as they come in, gravi-
tate and get on an I–9 form.
They will use a fraudulent or a fake
ID number, Social Security number.
They are a dime a dozen out there.
There are people, counterfeiters, out
there doing that.
What happens is it gums up the sys-
tem. It is like an accounting night-
mare, and it creates confusion for the
people who are supposed to regulate
this. So it gets to a point where they
can’t even track the people because
there are so many fraudulent numbers.
Where there is confusion, there is in-
ertia, and that is why nothing gets
done. And I think you look at the cur-
rent system, because it is not work-
able.
The H–2A was designed for seasonal
agriculture workers, but we do not use
it that way because it is not enforced.
They are supposed to come in for 10
months, and then they go home. But
the current system is you can get a
waiver, and that waiver can go on for 3
years. And if it is not enforced, they
forget about the waiver and they just
kind of fall into the society, and no-
body knows where they are at.
The beauty of this system is there is
an identification number. We are pro-
posing 15 digits in length, with the des-
ignation of ‘‘AG’’ in there, agriculture,
plus the smart chip in there that has
the biometrics.
So we separate guest workers from
the rest of the population. So we have
a database of just guest workers that
will be a lot easier to track. It will be
a lot easier to know where people are.
As people have to check into the sys-
tem, the onus is on the worker. They
can check in at their place of employ-
ment. They can check in at a post of-
fice. They can check in at a Federal
courthouse. And so it is going to be
easy for people to stay compliant.
If they are not in compliance with
checking in, they will have a grace pe-
riod. They have to become compliant.
If they are not compliant after a period
of time, they are subject to deporta-
tion.
One of the things we talked about is
what happens if somebody creates a de-
portable felony, and that would be
something like, maybe, vehicular
homicide from a DUI, which we have
seen too many of those in the news.
They would be subject to deportation.
If they are here with a family that
they came in illegally, they got accept-
ed into this program, if that were to
happen, they have put their family at
risk of deportation.
I don’t like that part, but it is also
that we need to look at the other side
of that.
We have allowed people to come into
this country to be a guest worker.
I have had the experience of being a
veterinarian, practicing for 30 years, in
large animals. We dealt with cattle
farms, dairy farms, horse farms, people
who did row crops, fruits and vegeta-
bles. Just name a crop, and we have
pretty much dealt with it.
I have gotten to a point where I
talked to a lot of people who were here
as migrant workers, and I sympathize
with them. Heck, I was still working
on the farm. That was one of my ambi-
tions of going to vet school. I wanted
to be outstanding in my field, and I
wound up being outstanding in every-
body else’s field.
But we got to know the immigrant,
and we got to a point where we could
ask them: Are you here legally or ille-
gally?
They were so honest. They say: I
came in illegally.
And I even asked them: Did you pay
a price to come in?
They said: Yeah, $2,000, $5,000, $8,000.
And it shocked me that people were
paying.
And this was probably 12 years ago,
11 years ago.
And I would ask them: Do you want
to become a citizen?
And it would amaze me how many of
these people said: No. I just want the
opportunity to come here, make a liv-
ing, and go home.
So one of the impetuses behind this
was let’s create a system where people
can come, fulfill the need we have, and
fulfill the need they have.
I have stayed in touch with some of
these people. They have made enough
money to go back home, create a farm
of their own, and they don’t have to
come back. But they will refer people
into the system.
So if we can streamline that and
make it easier for people to come in
when we have border security, they can
come in the legal way. There is no need
to sneak in.
If we can take that group that came
in illegally and they move into this,
the ones that know they probably don’t
have a bad record, they have moved
into the system.
So we can start cleaning up this
mess.
And the gentleman and I just shared
the analogy of working cattle. When
we have all of our calves, we sort out
the ones over here: the males over
here; the females over here.
So it is a way to sift through the
problem we have. If we do nothing, the
problem is going to grow.
The H–2A system right now, one of
the flaws with that, as I said, it was
supposed to be a 10-month program.
People come in. Our producers are pay-
ing $1,200 to $2,000 to get a person into
the country for the permit, to get them
the transportation and all that. When
they come into the country, about 25
percent of the people that come in on
an H–2A abscond. They go off the grid,
and the producer can’t get people to
come back that they have hired to
work and they have made that commit-
ment.
With this system, that person will
have that ‘‘AG’’ designation. The H–2A
program will have the ‘‘AG’’ designa-
tion, and with the H–2A program, the
goal is to make it a 10-month seasonal
program. After 10 months, you go
home. You have agreed to that. If you
only want to work 16 weeks, you work
the 16 weeks and go home.
So it gives flexibility to the worker.
It gives flexibility to the producer. It
creates food security for us because
this is something we need. And we get
rid of the adverse wage effect and we go
to the prevailing wage, which usually
is about 115 percent above minimum
wage.
But as you and I know, people who
work in agriculture, and if they are
picking crops or shipping stuff, they
are making $250 to $300 a day. They
work their tails off because they are
appreciative of the opportunity they
have, as you said, because they want to
live their dream. And they may become
a citizen down the road.
There is no citizenship with this. It is
a way for people to come in and work.
We get rid of the touchback provision
of Bob Goodlatte’s bill last year, and
that comes from feedback from our
dairy folks and other industries: I need
year-round workers.
A touchback does not work, because
we have had these people who have
been in here illegally for 5, 10, 15 years.
Let’s work together as Americans to
solve a problem so that we can sift
through this and end people coming in
illegally.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman if he has any other thoughts
that he would like to add, he can feel
free.
Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr.
YOHO), and I would add that, one of the
things that crosses my mind, as I talk
and listen here this evening, is that the
Social Security numbers, multiple uses
of a single number—it might even be
all zeroes, and all zeroes might be used
a thousand times in America, or more.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7456 July 25, 2019
So I hear these stories, and some of
the employers will say: Well, we have
followed all of the laws that we are re-
quired to follow.
But common sense isn’t something
that we hold them accountable for, ap-
parently, and so the Social Security
Administration, under Barack Obama
started issuing no-match letters.
b 1800
No-match letters used to go out to
say this Social Security number that
you are using isn’t a match. Then it
should go to the employer, too, and I
believe it used to.
I understand that the Trump admin-
istration may be picking that back up
again and issuing the no-match letters,
but that is not where it should stop.
That is where it should begin.
Mr. YOHO. The gentleman is exactly
right. I have had producers call me.
When I was in the district, they
brought that up, the no-match letters.
They are in a tizzy.
If we go back prior to President
Obama, there were no-match letters.
This is what is wrong when you have
bad policy. When you get rid of a pro-
gram or a requirement that is working,
people get complacent. They are like:
Hey, I don’t have to match up to Social
Security, so there is no reason for me
even to apply legally.
Then, when you try to reinstate it,
you get angry people, and it gums up
the system again.
That is why, if we have a good sys-
tem in place, there is no reason to back
away from it because this will be a pol-
icy that will live beyond you and me.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. KING of Iowa. In 1986, when the
Amnesty Act was signed by Ronald
Reagan, there was a requirement that
each employer would have I–9 docu-
ments that would be filed.
As soon as applicants came in, we
took a copy of their information. We
took the I–9 documents. We kept them
in our files carefully. Any individual
who came in and applied, we had the
right file, expecting INS—Immigration
and Naturalization Services, at that
time—personnel to be at our door any-
time, poking through all of our
records, which records are probably
still sitting in my archives somewhere.
That was going to work. They be-
lieved it was going to work. What hap-
pened was, slowly along the way, the
ACLU filed lawsuits, and people kind of
ducked and dodged. They found a way
to rationalize a way around it until
they got around to: Well, as an em-
ployer, I can’t be required to make a
judgment call. If I am looking at a pic-
ture of someone, I can’t be sure that
that is the face of the person who is in
front of me.
They would make the presumption
that was best for their business inter-
ests rather than best for the law en-
forcement part of it.
Then, if ICE doesn’t show up when
the no-match letters come through, be-
cause they are not cooperating with
the Social Security Administration to
go through those records when it is
very probable that when a Social Secu-
rity number is being used maybe in 10
places, in 10 different towns, you can’t
get to 10 jobs simultaneously. It should
make sense that nine or at least eight
of those are phony. They ought to go in
and identify those employers and em-
ployees and, if there are law violations,
bring charges against them.
That hasn’t been happening for years
in this country. It needs to happen.
This component that you proposed
looks to me like it is an improvement,
to segment off some of this, but I still
say we need to go into the Social Secu-
rity no-match and fix that.
Mr. YOHO. I think that is a great
thing. That is something we do need to
go into. Then, we need to have the al-
ternative.
The gentleman brought up a good
point that I have experienced, too,
talking to our producers. If you get an
I–9, which is the form to apply for a
job, if there is a Social Security num-
ber, if you question that and don’t hire
that person because you think it is not
legal, he has the right to sue you, and
he will win. If you don’t question that
and hire that person, the Department
of Labor or ICE shows up. They are
going to fine you for hiring a person
that you didn’t verify.
It is a mess. How did we become the
great country we are with such a—I
was going to say messed up system, or
something like that.
This is not rocket science. This is a
simple program, and there is a com-
monsense reform.
One of the things I didn’t bring up,
and I think the gentleman had asked
me about this, is that the ID number is
also a tax number. Taxes will be taken
out of that.
That is why I don’t want Social Secu-
rity associated with it, because Social
Security denotes benefits, that if I am
paying this, I get benefits. Those are
not tied here. Money that goes in will
go to other resources.
What we are proposing is that we are
going to make a requirement that each
person who comes in as a guest worker
has to have a catastrophic health in-
surance policy. If you come in here and
drive a car, you have to have insur-
ance. This will be something that we
are sitting down with the insurance
companies about. We have a pool of
about a million people who are going to
need some form of catastrophic health
insurance.
The other thing we are proposing is,
if they are here legally, and they have
a guest permit to work here, we go to
direct primary care. These are compa-
nies around the country—it was amaz-
ing. I went and visited one. If you are
between the ages of 18 and, I think, 25
or 30, your monthly cost for your
health insurance is $25 a month—$25 a
month. If you want blood work, it is $40
a month in my town. If you want an
MRI, it is $250. That is affordable
healthcare.
The beauty of this is the employer
can bring in a group of people. He can
get direct primary care for a small
amount of money. We will allow him to
deduct that cost. Then, there is cata-
strophic health insurance.
We have covered health insurance.
We have covered driving insurance. We
have covered a way for people to come
in. We have given them a number so
that we know where they are. They are
not gummed up in our Social Security
system.
We have started to separate into dif-
ferent silos or categories and envelopes
where they should be so that there is
rational thought to this.
The gentleman brought up
rationalizing. I shouldn’t have used
that word. Rationalizing is to make ra-
tionale a lie. That is used too often up
here.
We want to make commonsense re-
forms to have a program that works for
the immigrants, works for our employ-
ers, and works for our Nation.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I
wanted to add another piece to this.
This is an observation that I think ap-
plies across this country and a lot of
places today.
Some of my constituents made a
practice of going out through the park-
ing lot at the packing plant and pick-
ing up the check stubs on payday that
were dropped down on the asphalt.
Then, they stack a bunch of them up,
put them in a big manila envelope that
would kind of spring like an accordion,
and mail it off to me.
Here it comes in my mailbox. What is
this? There is no letter, no message, no
return address. Just my address on
there and all these check stubs with no
names on them.
But the withholding, it tells me, is
zero, zero, zero. No State withholding.
No Federal withholding.
What that tells me is that we have a
lot of people who are working unlaw-
fully in America, that when they
apply, they claim the maximum num-
ber of dependents, so there is zero with-
holding at the wage scale they have for
Federal income tax or State income
tax.
Yet, they still say they are paying
taxes. Well, yes, there is sales tax. I
suppose, in the rent, you are paying a
share of the property tax. Some of
those things are taking place. But that
is another place the system is gamed
by using Social Security numbers.
I am hopeful that the gentleman has
zeroed in on a way to address that.
Mr. YOHO. We have. That is the
beauty of the system. We get rid of all
that. It is not a Social Security with-
holding. It is going to be a tax. It will
be a guest worker tax, and money will
be taken out.
As I said, as I have shared this with
Members in a bipartisan manner, they
get excited about it. Our producers get
excited about it. Industry gets excited
about it.

f
NEWS MEDIA CREATES FALSE
NARRATIVES
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING) for 30
minutes.
Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker,
it is my privilege to have the oppor-
tunity to address you here on the floor
of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives and continue some of this
dialogue.
I am changing the subject a little bit
here this evening, Madam Speaker. I
wanted to take up the topic that had
this House of Representatives tied up
in knots last January, about January
15 or so.
I was the direct subject of those
things, and it has to do with, to refresh
people’s memory, a misquote on me
that came out of The New York Times
that alleged that I had tied three
phrases together. Two of them are odi-
ous ideologies, and one of them is one
of the most meritorious ideologies that
the world has ever seen. Those two, it
was a misquote by The New York
Times.
I believe that I have introduced a
document that has been publicly avail-
able since sometime last March 6, it is
dated, that makes it very clear that
The New York Times misquoted me
and that a lot of the media out there
that went into a hyperventilation fit
was jumping on an issue that we have
seen the pattern of many times over.
I came across a little comment about
The New York Times that said, ‘‘All
the news that fits the narrative.’’ Well,
that seems to be what happened last
January 10, when they wrote a story on
me about all the news that fits the nar-
rative, the narrative that they had cre-
ated, not necessarily the facts.
I would point out, Madam Speaker,
that there has been a whole series of
narratives out here that turned out to
be inactionable or, perhaps, false. I
would say that the biggest one and the
one that tied America up in knots the
longest and most intensely were the al-
legations against Justice Brett
Kavanaugh.
Of all of the folks who had accused
him, none of their allegations held up.
They were not corroborated in any
way. It was clear that he was targeted
because they didn’t want a conserv-
ative constitutionalist sitting on the
bench.
I am very thankful he is sitting on
the bench, and I am also very thankful
and grateful of the way he conducted
himself throughout those hearings.
That is not the first time we have
seen this. I felt great sympathy for
Justice Clarence Thomas when he en-
dured what he referred to as a high-
tech lynching back in the early 1990s.
The allegations made against him were
hyperventilation of the first order, and
it was maybe the worst that we had
seen.
I go back even further to Judge Bork,
who became a verb when he was
‘‘borked’’ by the United States Senate.
Allegations against him became, at a
certain point, untenable and
unsurvivable, from his career stand-
point.
These people that I have mentioned
so far were all wronged.
Let me put another one in, Madam
Speaker: Covington Catholic boys down
here by the Lincoln Memorial, stand-
ing there, respectfully and patiently,
while a musical device was being
pounded in front of one young man’s
face.
That turned into better than a week
of intense media assaults and attacks,
verbally and keyboard-wise, against
those Covington Catholic boys because
the media’s narrative fit their nar-
rative.
All the news that fits their narrative,
but not the truth, and not stepping
back to take an objective look to try
to understand what is going on.
It is seldom that the world is as bad
as the media would like to tell us that
it is. The Covington Catholic boys were
exonerated when the camera was
panned back, and we looked at it as
America within the full context of
what was going on. They were pa-
tiently enduring and experiencing
something that I am sure was a unique
experience for them.
They hadn’t spent time to speak of
here in Washington, D.C. They hadn’t
been involved in a demonstration of
that kind. Just innocent young men,
clean-cut, one of them wearing a Make
America Great cap, probably more of
them doing that, and patiently there.
People would say: Have you ever seen
such a punchable face? I would call it a
very innocent face of a young man who
kept a tight little smile on his face
while he waited for that drum to be fin-
ished being beat in front of his face.
I would add another one about that
same period of time, Madam Speaker,
Michael Cohen, the President’s attor-
ney at that period of time, or former
attorney. The news media was all over
that Michael Cohen had been directed
to lie to Congress by the President of
the United States, Donald Trump. That
was a story that lived for 4 or 5 or more
days until the truth came out that that
narrative was false.
False narratives on Justice
Kavanaugh, false narratives on the
Covington Catholic boys, false nar-
ratives on Michael Cohen.
Then, we had, at about the same
time, the story on Jussie Smollett,
who said that he had been attacked
and, apparently, attempted to be
lynched by some folks of the opposite
race that he is.
It turned out that, when we saw the
videos of who was buying this rope and
the other material in the store not
very far from there, those folks were
not there to attack Jussie Smollett be-
cause of anything to do with race. It
had to do with what surely appears to
be a hoax. Now, we have a Federal in-
vestigation into the prosecuting attor-
ney in Chicago who found a way to
turn Jussie Smollett loose.
That is another case where the nar-
rative that was delivered by the media
day after day after day was false, but it
was the narrative that told the story
that they wanted to be told, all the
news that fits the narrative.
We have another one here that just
recently passed behind us just a few
days back. Georgia State Representa-
tive Erica Thomas made an argument
and cried in front of the media that she
got into an altercation in a store and
was told by a man to ‘‘go back where
you came from.’’
b 2015
And after that was scrutinized, and
after the video was watched, and after
the people that were witnesses there fi-
nally came forward and got their nar-
ratives out, we found out that that
story wasn’t true either. It was all the
news that fit the narratives of The New
York Times and others, but it wasn’t
true, and she finally admitted it.
I have just listed some along here.
Madam Speaker, here are some other
stories that were put before us where
there has been no consequence and no
action taken; there is Governor Ralph
Northam of Virginia, just across the
Potomac, who was either the fellow in
blackface or the fellow in the KKK cos-
tume. We are not sure which but, ap-
parently, he is one of them, but no ac-
tion was taken on that.
That was a long time ago. I am okay
with acknowledging what took place;
looking at the man that he is today.
But the hyperventilation around that
was very intense, and it was also a nar-
rative that the news media wanted to
be true.
I believe one of those two things
seems to have a lot of legs.
Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax,
multiple accusations of sexual assault;
no action down there.
The Attorney General Mark Herring
confessed that he was in blackface. No
action down there. So there is a stale-
mate in Virginia.
No consequence for these three alle-
gations in Virginia. No consequence so
far for Jussie Smollett. No consequence
so far for Erica Thomas. We saw all
those things.
Madam Speaker, by the way, I will
point out that I have not been critical
of the statements made by Members of
Congress, no matter how much press
they have gotten.
The Quad Squad has gotten a lot of
press for certain statements. They do
have a right to freedom of speech. But
with regard to AOC, and ILHAN OMAR,
and RASHIDA TLAIB, and AYANNA
PRESSLEY, some of those statements
that are made are on their face pretty
stark.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7458 July 25, 2019
I think our job here in America is to
recognize that people have a right to
freedom of speech. It is a constitu-
tional guarantee.
I sat with some people that were, I
will say, significantly seasoned in the
world and in the business world. These
folks were out of Europe. And I said to
them: You need constitutional protec-
tion for freedom of speech in the same
way, along the lines that we have in
America, because we are protected. We
can say what we want to say; freedom
of speech, religion, the press, and to
peaceably assemble, and to petition the
government for redress of grievance.
That is America.
The ability to express our thoughts
and our ideas and freely exchange them
with others generates other ideas. Bad
ideas drift by the wayside after they
are examined in open public dialogue;
and good ideas get legs, as you saw to-
night with Congressman YOHO lifting
his immigration bill up before every-
one for an opportunity to debate.
Good ideas sustain themselves. Bad
ideas, if you have a rational public that
believes in the age of reason—and we
need to be sustaining this age of rea-
son—then the world gets to be a better
place.
If we suppress thoughts and we sup-
press dialogue, if we tell people they
don’t have freedom of speech, if we
punish them for exercising their con-
stitutional right to freedom of speech,
it diminishes all of us because then we
don’t have competing ideas. We only
have the repetition of politically cor-
rect utterances; and that is not going
to sustain the greatest nation the
world has ever seen. It was built on
these freedoms.
America was built on freedom of
speech, religion, and the press, the Sec-
ond Amendment, the right to keep and
bear arms, the property rights that are
in the Fifth Amendment, no double
jeopardy, you face a jury of your peers.
And the rights that are not enumer-
ated in the Constitution devolve to the
people or the States respectively.
We are built on free enterprise, cap-
italism, and Judeo-Christian values.
We are descended from the full flow of
Western civilization that comes here to
America; and today we are the flagship
of Western civilization.
Now I have named all of this, but I
want to state, again, AOC, ILHAN OMAR,
RASHIDA TLAIB, AYANNA PRESSLEY, and
every other Member of this United
States Congress, and everyone in the
United States of America has a God-
given right to freedom of speech, and
thought, and expression, and religion,
and assembly, and press. And if we
don’t protect those rights, America de-
volves towards the Third World, not as-
cending onward and upward into the
shining city that was so well and elo-
quently envisioned by Ronald Reagan.
So if we disagree with what someone
says, we can state our opposition and
our reasons why; and we need to have
respectful disagreement here in this
Congress.
The debates that have taken place
here over the years have shaped the
fabric of America. We often say this is
the greatest debate body in the world
here. I am not as convinced of that
today, or this year, as I was up to this
point.
When I see that there was a false al-
legation made against me, a misquote
in The New York Times, intentional or
not, has turned into something that is
supposedly a fact; and then, the things
that are clearly not facts are repeated
over and over again by a media that
wants their narrative to be true.
So there was a resolution that came
to the floor here in the House that
was—I am named in the first para-
graph. This is H. Res. 41, on January 15
of 2019, and it starts out this way:
‘‘Whereas, on January 10, 2019, Rep-
resentative STEVE KING was quoted as
asking, ‘White nationalist, white su-
premacist, Western civilization—how
did that language become offensive?’ ’’
That is part of the quote, not all of
it. It is not even quoted in the context
that the article quoted it in. But that
is actually a true statement that is a
quote that was published in The New
York Times, and that is what it says,
Whereas, STEVE KING was quoted as
saying this.
And then there are a whole series of
whereases here that reject the odious
ideology that White supremacy and
White nationalism—there are a whole
lot of other odious ideologies, and some
of them are openly defended here on
the floor of this House of Representa-
tives, not either one of those, not by
me, and not by anybody.
I agreed with those whereases all the
way down. In fact, the rejection that I
had put into this CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD the previous Friday was more
clear and more stark, and it rejected
those odious ideologies more distinctly
and more effectively than the resolu-
tion that was introduced by Mr. CLY-
BURN.
All those whereases I agree with. I
got down to the resolve of this resolu-
tion. It says: ‘‘Resolved, that the House
of Representatives once again rejects
white nationalism and white suprem-
acy as hateful expressions of intoler-
ance that are contradictory to the val-
ues that define the people of the United
States.’’
Agreed again.
So, Madam Speaker, I am making
this point that the world seems to for-
get that I supported this resolution, be-
cause it was true. All it said about me
was that The New York—that I had
been quoted as saying that. That is
true. The New York Times quoted me
as saying that. I don’t have any reason
to disagree with this. I voted for it, and
I asked all of the Members to vote for
it for a number of reasons; but one of
them was, I didn’t want to see this
Congress split over something like
this.
Why are we policing something of
this nature?
Why does Congress think that we
should police the speech of Members on
the floor here, especially if it doesn’t
violate the rules, or outside these
Chambers?
Never in the history of the United
States House of Representatives has a
Member been removed from commit-
tees because of even an accurate quote
by the press outside these walls. It
didn’t take place in this building or on
the Capitol grounds in any way what-
soever.
Never has even an accurate quote
been used to sanction a Member of Con-
gress.
So we have, instead, a misquote that
was in a 56-minute telephone interview
with The New York Times reporter
who asserted—and our Minority Leader
KEVIN MCCARTHY said that he talked to
him on the phone—he said he could
type as fast as anybody can talk and he
can punctuate accurately. So I am
wondering why he stopped me a couple
of times in that 56-minute interview
and asked me to repeat a sentence so
that he could get it right.
In fact, I am going to guess that
there isn’t anybody that can take a
conventional typewriter and type accu-
rately and punctuate accurately at the
speed that I talk in a normal conversa-
tion.
In fact, the wonderful Christy over
here, and her magic keyboard, can
barely keep up at about 250 words a
minute when I am rolling along. And I
feel a little sorry for her, but I like her
a lot.
And so that is my point: There is no
reporter that is even capable of doing
that. But he has convinced KEVIN
MCCARTHY that he is the ‘‘magic finger
man’’ and he couldn’t possibly make a
mistake; not with a hyphen; not with
comma; not with a voice inflection.
Oh, by the way, this is going be a lit-
tle harder now, Christy, because Zig
Ziglar used to use this to describe how
things can be misconstrued. And I am
saying that this quote was more than
misconstrued. It just happened to fit
the narrative that The New York
Times and a number of other liberal or-
ganizations wanted.
But Zig Ziglar would put it out this
way: There are four different ways, and
it is going to be printed all the same
way in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, and
then I am going to explain what is dif-
ferent.
But, Madam Speaker, for those that
are, say, watching on C–SPAN, to un-
derstand how language works, it works
like this: He would say, I never said she
stole the money, with the emphasis on
the word ‘‘she’’. That says one thing: I
never said she stole the money.
Another way to say the same words
are: I never said she stole the money,
with the emphasis on the word ‘‘stole’’.
Another one is, I never said she stole
the money, with the emphasis on the
word ‘‘I’’.
And the last one is: I never said she
stole the money, with the emphasis on
the word ‘‘money’’. There are four dif-
ferent meanings that come out of ex-
actly the same words.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7459
July 25, 2019
And KEVIN MCCARTHY, and a handful
of others, believe that somehow the
punctuation that was in The New York
Times, and the hyperventilation that
emerged on the punctuation of The
New York Times, is justifiable to at-
tempt to disenfranchise 755,000 Iowans.
And he doesn’t remember or acknowl-
edge that more people voted for me in
the last election than they did KEVIN
MCCARTHY, or the chair of the Repub-
lican Conference.
And the legitimacy that was con-
ferred upon me was conferred after any
other allegation other than this mis-
quote that happens to be of The New
York Times.
Now, I would add, handling language
in this way is this way; that the dia-
logue that went on in that 56-minute
interview was a dialogue that the re-
porter refuses to even speculate as to
what question it was that he might
have asked me.
I’m pretty sure that he didn’t have
that typed out in his notes either, so he
doesn’t know the question.
But I am going to submit that it was
about the discussion that had to do
with the weaponization of language;
the weaponization of language that has
been calculated by the left.
And I happen to know that there was
a meeting in the Mandarin Hotel here
in Washington, D.C. that commenced
on November 12, 2016; and that was
going to be a meeting on how to exploit
the Hillary presidency if she was going
to be President-elect on that day, when
that 3-day conference began.
But as it turned out, it was Presi-
dent-elect Donald Trump that they had
to react to and figure out how they
were going to take the highest levels of
the Democratic Party that emerged in
the Mandarin Hotel, including George
Soros, whose picture was on the front
of the article written by Politico on
that day.
Out of that came a number of
weaponization strategies; one of them
was the resistance movement. And you
saw demonstrations in the streets all
over America that commenced shortly
after that, all the way through the in-
auguration, and for a month or two
after that, all these demonstrations.
The idea was, don’t let Donald Trump
govern. If you weren’t successful in
beating him in the election; if—let’s
just say, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page
and those who said they weren’t going
to ever let it happen, and the rest of
that cabal, they fell short in the elec-
tion, but they continued to try to deny
Donald Trump the opportunity to rule
and to function as the President of the
United States.
Madam Speaker, that topic has been
before us intensively as recently as
yesterday.
And so, the strategy that came out of
the Mandarin Hotel in that conference
that began with the Democratic Party
at the highest levels there, including
George Soros and the DNC, on Sunday,
the 12th of November—it happened to
be Charles Manson’s birthday, I happen
to know. I don’t know why I know
that—but it was about the
weaponization of terms.
Our discussion in that interview with
The New York Times was about the
weaponization of terms. And I have
spoken of the weaponization of terms
before that in an interview with The
Christian Science Monitor, and there,
it is a clear quote that rolls along that
says: It is about weaponizing these
terms.
Madam Speaker, I use the terms—if I
can find it here, The Christian Science
Monitor article. It was using the terms
Western civilization or Western culture
as that—why is it that they are trying
to turn that into a pejorative term?
And that interview was clearly done in
The Christian Science Monitor, and it
is clear that that would be the topic I
was talking about; not advocacy for
odious ideologies, but instead won-
dering why it would be that the left
would be seeking to weaponize the very
meritorious term, Western civilization.
That is clearly the case.
And I have been attacked for defend-
ing Western civilization, but I have
never defended White nationalism or
White supremacy.
b 2030
I would point out on this chart,
Madam Speaker, when was it used? I
mean, when were these terms used
within our dialogue? Here is one. This
is a quote from me.
We went through LexisNexis and
went on back and asked from the year
2000 up until the end of 2018 how many
times was I quoted as ever using the
term ‘‘white nationals’’ or ‘‘white su-
premacy?’’ You can see down here in
the red and in the green, it goes clear
on out to the end of 2018—never. Not
one time was I quoted as using either
one of those terms that identify the
odious ideologies in all the LexisNexis
searches that were there.
It makes it implausible that, unless
those terms were fed to me by The New
York Times, it is very unlikely that
they would have ever been uttered in
that interview. But I said I am defend-
ing Western civilization. I have been
consistent and clear on that, Madam
Speaker.
And so this chart, the blue line shows
the utilization of ‘‘Western civiliza-
tion,’’ the times that I have been
quoted using the term ‘‘Western civili-
zation.’’ Instead of zero times being
quoted as using ‘‘white nationalism’’ or
‘‘white supremacy,’’ ‘‘Western civiliza-
tion’’ totals, that number shows on
here, but here is the utilization of it,
and it totals 276 times.
So to keep it simple, I boiled it down
to the text here. I was quoted as saying
‘‘Western civilization’’ in The New
York Times—number of times quoted
as saying ‘‘Western civilization,’’ 276
times since the year 2000 the press has
quoted me as using that term. I am
fine with that. I proudly defend West-
ern civilization, consistently. But when
did I ever say ‘‘white nationalism’’ or
‘‘white supremacy’’ or any derivative
thereof? Zero times, zero.
So it is pretty clear that when The
New York Times plugs that in, I was
likely responding to the utilization of
those terms in a question if those
words were even said at all.
And here is another little chart. The
leader made a point that, well, you
know, that I had defined ‘‘white na-
tionalism,’’ and I had defined it in an
earlier interview by saying that it is a
derogatory term and it implies racism,
but it might have meant something dif-
ferent, I said, 1, 2, or 3 years ago.
This is an October 20 interview with
Dave Price on WHO.
So I went back and looked, how often
was the term ‘‘white nationalism’’ used
historically, going back to the year
2000 on LexisNexis? And you can see
this line staying down here near zero,
all these years from 2000 all the way up
to 2015.
You would say in today’s vernacular,
virtually zero times—virtually no
times, excuse me—not zero, but vir-
tually no times was the term ‘‘white
nationalism’’ even used in our dialogue
until you get to 2016 where it jumps up.
These numbers really are 1 to 200
times a year throughout all the publi-
cations, all the writers, all the things
that show up on LexisNexis that
searches everything in print, including
the blogs all the way back.
So this is virtually none, 1 to 200
times a year by everybody. And this
isn’t identified to my utilization.
Then, in 2016, it jumps from virtually
none up to 10,000 times a year. And
then when you go to 2017, it jumps all
the way up to 30,000 times. And in 2018,
it is still up there at 20,000 times.
So 10, 30, 20,000 times used, virtually
unused before. And I explained and as-
serted that they are weaponizing that
term, and they are injecting it into the
political dialogue and using it as a pej-
orative term against anybody they can
stick this label on.
And that is exactly what was going
on, and that is exactly what I defined
in that interview that was so objected
to by the minority leader of the House
of Representatives. I was far more
right than I thought.
It was a general understanding I had.
Now when I go back and look at the
facts, I just nailed it cold as to what is
going on.
The left is weaponizing terms. I was
explaining that. I explained it accu-
rately, more accurately than I thought
I had, and what is my reward for being
so precise? And my reward for being so
accurate, my reward for defending
Western civilization is a pejorative de-
cision that is unprecedented in the his-
tory of the United States Congress to
stifle my freedom of speech and to
limit, to the extent they could, my
ability to be reelected going into the
future.
That is the kind of thing we can’t
have in this Congress is for someone to
be sitting in leadership that thinks
that they have the authority to deter-
mine who is not going to represent peo-
ple outside of their own district. That

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

is destructive to our constitutional Re-
public.
The voice of we the people elects the
Representatives, and when they do so,
they have a right to the full-throated
representation, and that has been de-
nied so far this year because of the ar-
bitrary and capricious and false conclu-
sion that has been drawn by KEVIN
MCCARTHY. And so that situation needs
took rectified.
Anyone who has read this 6-page
fact-check document, not one person
has found a hole in it. Not one rational
person has found a hole in it.
Those that did read it and considered
it said: You make some good points;
yes, it makes sense. Well, we maybe
have to find a time to fix this, but it is
not very convenient right now.
My point is, Madam Speaker, that if
you find that somebody has been
locked up in jail and the DNA tests
prove that they are not guilty, you
don’t wait until they have a good job.
You open up the doors and you give
them back their freedom. And in this
case, you give back to the people of
Iowa the full-throated representation
of their senior Member, the dean of the
Iowa House of Representatives.
And one of the things my constitu-
ents like about me is they always get
the straight, unvarnished truth wheth-
er they like it or not. And they will
come up and they will say: I don’t
agree with you on everything, but I
know that you are telling me the
truth; I know you are working hard;
and I know that you are objective in
this, and we need somebody that we
don’t have to wonder what they are
saying.
I don’t ever dance around with words.
I tell people what I think and what I
know; and I give them the good news
when it is there, and I am eager to do
so, and I give them the bad news when
it is time because they deserve the
straightest of answers.
We are straight talkers in the Mid-
west. We are descended from people
that came across the prairie to live
free or die out there in the plains, and
we built a pretty good place. It is the
best place in the world to live and raise
a family.
We have people that are coming
back. When they are young, sometimes
they will go off and look at the rest of
the country or the world, but they
come back, especially when it is time
for the kids to go to school, and they
contribute back to the community,
generation on top of generation on top
of generation.
That is some of the things that I
have worked to establish.
In the time I have been here in Con-
gress, we have taken Iowa into number
one, the Fourth Congressional District
into number one in the production of
renewable fuels and energy. By the
time you add together the ethanol, bio-
diesel, wind and, now, solar, we
produce more BTUS of energy than any
other congressional district that is a
renewable outside of this.
We have gotten transportation routes
that have been set up, four-lane High-
way 20 is done. We rank in the top first
or second or third in corn and soybeans
and in pork and in egg production,
right at or near the top in all of that.
It is a wholesome place.
When I look outside from my place, I
see no neighbors, but I never had a bad
one. And we have got a crop that looks
great this year.
When I see all those little kids boil-
ing up to the front of our church to put
their dollar in the basket, those kids
are going to grow up in those commu-
nities, too, and we are going to have
generation after generation that rep-
licates and improves upon the success
that we have had.
But we can’t do that if we are going
to live in a country where there is an
arbitrary censorship taking place and
no opportunity for me to even defend
myself.
Innocent until proven guilty? Well,
that is true for a whole bunch of these
people that I named, but STEVE KING,
instead, is guilty by accusation, guilty
by false allegation, even now that I
have proven to the House of Represent-
atives that, beyond any reasonable
question, this was a misquote. It was
something that was ginned up, and it
created a political lynch mob.
It is time to cut the rope and get me
back in full force of where my constitu-
ents deserve, to give them the fullest
representation that is there.
I will face any accuser any time, and
I will deliver all the facts; and if any-
body can find a hole in this 6-page fact-
check document or any other state-
ment that I have made, I would be very
happy to look anybody in the eye to
answer those questions.
Madam Speaker, I appreciate your
attention to this matter here this
evening, and I yield back the balance of
my time.

Let us pray.
Almighty God, the author and fin-
isher of our faith, we rejoice in the
privileges You have strewn on our
path. Give us the courage to use our
opportunities to serve You and coun-
try. May our lawmakers strive to stand
for right though the heavens fall. Re-
mind them that evil prospers when
good people do nothing. May our Sen-
ators also use the gift of intercessory
prayer to unlock Your storehouse of
blessings so desperately needed in our
Nation and world. In hours of hardship,
provide them with Your peace. Lord,
give our legislators the wisdom that
enables them to hasten the coming of
Your Kingdom of justice and peace.
We pray in Your sovereign Name.
Amen.

f
BUDGET AGREEMENT
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
today we expect the House of Rep-
resentatives will pass the 2-year gov-
ernment funding agreement the Trump
administration and Speaker PELOSI an-
nounced earlier this week. I stand with
the President, who has publicly ex-
pressed his support for the agreement
on several occasions. I am grateful to
the members of his administration who
led the negotiations: Secretary
Mnuchin, Acting Chief of Staff
Mulvaney, and Acting OMB Director
Vought.
Considering the circumstances of di-
vided government, this is a good deal.
After the House approves it today with
bipartisan support, I expect the Senate
to do the same next week. Here is why
it is a good deal: It achieves the No. 1
goal on the Republican side of the aisle
of providing for the common defense
and continuing our progress in rebuild-
ing the Armed Forces of the United
States and modernizing them so they
can continue to keep Americans safe
and project power for years to come.
This has been a top shared priority for
this Republican Senate and this Repub-
lican White House for 21⁄2 years.
Pentagon leaders need stable, reli-
able, and sufficient resources. The
greatest military on Earth should not
drift in uncertainty. Our servicemem-
bers deserve better than a string of
funding crises and continuing resolu-
tions. Our commanders need predict-
able resources and sufficient resources
to lay the foundations for the future of
our national defense.
Servicemembers deserve to deploy
armed with state-of-the-art training
and cutting-edge equipment; their fam-
ilies deserve the best support services
the Nation can offer; and the Nation as
a whole deserves the global presence
that is up to snuff and competitive
with the leaps forward in which our ad-
versaries have invested heavily.
That is why we have delivered his-
toric increases in resources for mod-
ernization and DOD reforms—to ensure
the U.S. military is strong and agile
enough to confront a growing number
of threats to America and our inter-
ests. That is why just a few months ago
we authorized the largest year-on-year
increase in defense funding in more
than a decade. This funding agreement
is the next step forward in that proc-
ess.
Every Member of this body knows
the threats we face are serious and get-
ting more serious: the resurgence of
great power competition with nations
like Russia and China; the destabiliza-
tion of influence of state-sponsored ter-
ror and regional aggression from bad
actors such as Iran; and the testing of
historic alliances.
Amidst the growing international
chaos, the preeminent obligation of the
U.S. government is to provide for the
common defense. This agreement
prioritizes that commitment to the
safety and the security of the Amer-
ican people.
A nation that understands these
threats and takes them seriously
makes serious investments in the read-
iness of its own defenses today and the
modernization that will preserve their
strength into the future.
For years, we have seen China extend
its strategic reach, testing the waters
of the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5074 July 25, 2019
We have watched its Communist lead-
ership nearly double military spending
in the last decade and push the bound-
aries in everything from offshore terri-
torial claims to 5G technology.
America’s edge is in jeopardy. Our al-
lies in the Pacific are uneasy. The ad-
ministration’s budget agreement with
the Speaker will allow America to en-
sure that our own foot stays on the gas
pedal as well.
Meanwhile, in the Middle East, we
are confronted daily with escalating
threats to our allies and interests.
State-sponsored terror and proxy ac-
tions are becoming bolder. Gray zone
activity in places like the Straits of
Hormuz is raising the economic and
geopolitical stakes of Iran’s meddling.
From Syria to Crimea, Russia con-
tinues to stretch its legs. Not since the
height of the Soviet Union have we
seen Moscow this focused on extending
influence beyond its borders. All over
the world, historic alliances and part-
nerships like NATO need to be
strengthened and renewed for this new
landscape.
Fortunately, in the coming days, we
will have the opportunity to address all
these areas—Europe, the Middle East,
the Indo-Pacific, and beyond. That op-
portunity is this bipartisan spending
agreement. So I am grateful to the ad-
ministration for ensuring that such ro-
bust funding for our national security
is included in this package. It will
make us safer worldwide and make
needed investments in our own facili-
ties right here at home, like Fort
Knox, Fort Campbell, and the Blue
Grass Army Depo, which Kentucky is
proud to host.
What is more, I commend the Presi-
dent’s team for firmly holding the line
on the laundry list of leftwing policy
riders that some House Democrats had
sought to push throughout their par-
tisan appropriations process over there
on the other side.
We are talking about far-left wish
list items, things like reversing the
Trump administration’s decision and
getting title X taxpayer dollars flowing
back into the pocket of Planned Par-
enthood, weakening the conscience
rights of healthcare professionals, re-
moving protections for the Second
Amendment, and efforts that would
have weakened ICE and defunded the
President’s efforts to secure our bor-
der.
These are just some of the policy rid-
ers the far left had hoped to smuggle
into the appropriations process—per-
haps using the full faith and credit of
the United States as leverage, but the
administration froze all of them out.
They are not in this deal. They shep-
herded an agreement that delivers on
our most basic responsibility to the
American people. They set the stage to
provide for the common defense. Today
it is the House’s turn to follow
through, and then, in the near future,
it will be ours.
MEASURE PLACED ON THE
CALENDAR—S. 2258
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
I understand there is a bill at the desk
that is due a second reading.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will read the title of
the bill for a second time.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read as follows:
A bill (S. 2258) to provide anti-retaliation
protections for antitrust whistleblowers.
Mr. MCCONNELL. In order to place
the bill on the calendar under the pro-
visions of rule XIV, I object to further
proceedings.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection having been heard, the
bill will be placed on the calendar.
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order

ELECTION SECURITY
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, we
all know that yesterday former Special
Counsel Mueller testified before two
House committees. I believe it was cru-
cial for the American people to hear
straight from Robert Mueller’s mouth
that the President was not—underline
‘‘not’’—exonerated by his report, de-
spite what the President claims. It is
utterly amazing. Mueller says some-
thing, and the President says the exact
opposite to the media. We have never
had a President who has lied so often.
He knows what Mueller said, but he
thinks he can dupe people when he says
it, and I hope it is not true.
It is important for the American peo-
ple to hear straight from Robert
Mueller’s mouth that the President is
not telling the truth when he claims
that Mueller found no obstruction.
Mueller did not. Anyone who watched
the hearing saw it. It was as plain as
could be, but that is not the subject of
my remarks today.
My remarks are about election secu-
rity. Above all, it was important for all
of us to hear straight from Robert
Mueller’s mouth that the threat from
Russia and other foreign adversaries
seeking to meddle in our elections was
very real and still very much ongoing.
When asked about Russian inter-
ference in our democracy, Mr. Mueller
responded:
It wasn’t a single attempt. They’re doing it
as we sit here. And they expect to do it dur-
ing the next campaign.
Leader MCCONNELL, let me read you
those sentences, if you care about
America. Mueller said about Russian
interference:
It wasn’t a single attempt. They’re doing it
as we sit here. And they expect to do it dur-
ing the next campaign.
He went on to say that many more
countries were developing capabilities
similar to what Russia has. He re-
minded members of the House Intel-
ligence Committee that Russian fake
images reached nearly 126 million peo-
ple on Facebook alone.
As if it even needed to be spelled out,
Mr. Mueller added: ‘‘Much more needs
to be done in order to protect against
these intrusions, not just by the Rus-
sians but by others as well.’’
Mueller’s testimony was a clarion
call for election security. Mueller’s tes-
timony should be a wake-up call to
every American—Democrat, Repub-
lican, liberal, and conservative—that
the integrity of our elections is at
stake and to be manipulated by a for-
eign power.
This is all about the future of this
country. If we lose faith in our elec-
toral process, democracy begins to
walk away from us, and we will be a
different country than the glorious
country we have been since 1789. Yet
our Republican colleagues put their
heads in the sand.
Donald Trump, as usual, with his
enormous self-ego, doesn’t want to
admit the Russians interfered—even
though he encouraged it publicly—be-
cause he feels it will cast some illegit-
imacy on his election. The election is
over. He is President. I wish he
weren’t. But that is not the issue here.
The issue is the future of our democ-
racy. And our Republican colleagues,
who, once again, either are afraid of
President Trump or, even worse, seek-
ing advantage from Russian inter-
ference, are keeping their heads in the
sand.
We have tried. We have worked with
our Republican colleagues to craft sev-
eral bipartisan bills—Democrats and
Republicans alike—to safeguard our
election infrastructure and deter any
foreign adversary from targeting our
democracy in 2020. We have asked the
Republican majority on the Appropria-
tions Committee to devote more re-
sources to harden their election sys-
tems but to no avail.
Leader MCCONNELL has refused to
bring these bills to the floor. Repub-
licans have rebuffed our request for ad-
ditional appropriations this year. Elec-
tion security goes into MCCONNELL’s
legislative graveyard, even though it
should be the most nonpartisan of
issues.
He has refused—refused—to let us
consider anything, using his power as
majority leader. And he is backed up
by every single Republican who is
complicit in not stopping the Russians,
as Putin seeks to stretch his long arm
and delve into the sacred process of
how we elect our officials.

of ensuring our elections are fair and

free from foreign interference? Why
would Leader MCCONNELL and every
one of our Republican colleagues, who
now have failed to step up to the plate
even though some of them work with
our colleagues on bills, ignore the ad-
monitions of the Founding Fathers,
who said that foreign interference is a
grave danger to democracy? What
could be the downside of ensuring our
elections are fair and free? I ask that
question of Leader MCCONNELL.
The only excuse I have heard is he
says that additional action isn’t nec-
essary. Well, Mr. Mueller, who has done
far more investigative work on this
than just about anybody else, cleared
up all of that yesterday. He didn’t say
we have done enough already. He didn’t
say we are on top of it. He said that
much more needs to be done.
Leader MCCONNELL, do you disagree?
Is Mueller wrong? Are all the experts
wrong—the FBI, appointed by Presi-
dent Trump; the NSA, appointed by
President Trump; and all those leaders
who say we need to do more? We have
heard them.
We are going to continue our fight
for election security. We are not going
to let Leader MCCONNELL put the bills
passed by the House into his legislative
graveyard without a fight. You are
going to hear from us on this issue over
and over again.
The legislative graveyard of Leader
MCCONNELL is known from one end of
the country to the other. Americans
know he doesn’t want to help them. He
doesn’t want to help middle-class
Americans.
The graveyard of our Republican col-
leagues, in obeisance to powerful and
special interests, gets larger, more
stunning, and more debilitating to this
country every day.
Yesterday, Democratic Senators re-
quested unanimous consent to pass
some election security legislation that
they have worked on, much of which
was bipartisan. The Republican major-
ity blocked them. Soon—I believe in
about an hour—I will be asking unani-
mous consent on the House-passed elec-
tion security bill. It is sitting here. It
is in the leader’s drawer. Is he going to
let this go to the legislative graveyard?
We will see in an hour. I hope at least
one of my Republican colleagues will
come to the floor and urge that we vote
on this or at least debate it and amend
it—one.
The Republican leader’s intransigent
resistance to this effort is inexplicable.
Why he wants to put election security
in his legislative graveyard is impos-
sible to explain on a logical basis. I be-
lieve his intransigence and his resist-
ance are untenable.
When I move in about an hour for
unanimous consent to bring the House
bill to the floor, maybe something will
be chirping in some of the brains of
some of my colleagues here and say:
We can’t allow the Russians to inter-
fere, and we have to do something.
If they don’t agree with what the
House passed, let them propose amend-
ments or let them propose an alter-
native, but let us debate. This is a na-
tional security issue of paramount im-
portance.
I urge my friend the leader to stand
down and let election security come to
the floor. If he doesn’t, all of America
will know, when Russia interferes,
why.
f
BUDGET AGREEMENT
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on
another matter—this is on deficits. I
am not in the habit of commenting on
every opinion issued by newspapers I
don’t typically agree with, but this
week, the Wall Street Journal wrote
such a howler of an editorial that I feel
compelled to.
The Wall Street Journal editorial
board criticized the latest budget
agreement for its increase in domestic
spending, wringing its hands over the
effect on deficits, while simultaneously
praising defense spending, which the
editorial board believes, for some rea-
son, has nothing to do with deficits.
This, by the way, is the same edi-
torial board that played head cheer-
leader for the Republican tax bill,
which contained such mammoth tax
cuts for the biggest corporations and
the already wealthy that it will add $2
trillion to our deficits—$2 trillion.
Huge tax cuts contributed more to the
deficit than all of these spending pro-
grams put together, but the Wall
Street Journal cheered on the tax cuts
and now says: Don’t spend for the mid-
dle class on things like education and
infrastructure that have broad support
in America and helping kids go to col-
lege. Don’t spend on that because it in-
creases the deficit, but it is OK to pass
massive tax cuts for the rich and the
big corporations that are already prof-
itable.
So, for the sake of the record, the
Wall Street Journal editorial board be-
lieves deficits are really bad but only if
they are caused by investments in
Americans’ healthcare or education or
infrastructure. When deficits are
caused by defense spending and when
deficits are caused by tax cuts for the
wealthy, they are peachy.
The truth is, so many of my Repub-
lican friends have engaged in the same
egregious bit of hypocrisy. So I have a
few words this morning for my deficit-
scolding friends Mick Mulvaney and
the Wall Street Journal editorial
board: A deficit is a deficit is a deficit.
They try to make the argument that
massive tax cuts won’t create a deficit,
but all the numbers that are coming in
now and are projected in the future say
that is just not true. If the Wall Street
Journal really cared about deficits
above all, they wouldn’t have sup-
ported the tax bill.
When the Senate debated these tax
cuts in 2017, there were several pro-
posals on the table—many Democrats
and Republicans supported them—that
would have reduced taxes on corpora-
tions while remaining deficit-neutral.
Many would have changed the Tax
Code in ways I didn’t support, but
nonetheless they would have held reve-
nues and expenditures in line. We
didn’t hear a peep out of the Journal to
support those proposals—oh, no. Demo-
crats even put together a deficit-neu-
tral middle-class tax cut at the time,
but Republicans ignored it and pushed
through Congress a bill that lined the
pockets of the wealthy—blowing a $2
trillion hole in our deficit. The Wall
Street Journal could have said some-
thing then. They didn’t. They were
asleep at the switch. They were asleep
at the switch then, and they are crying
now.
The fact is, Republican tax cuts for
the wealthy and endless wars in the
Middle East, championed by George
Bush and the Republican Party, are the
big drivers of the Nation’s debt and def-
icit, not nondefense domestic spending.
President Obama, to his credit, cut
the budget deficit in half during his
term. The last time we had a surplus
was under a Democratic President, Bill
Clinton. In fact, every single Repub-
lican administration has added to the
deficit, while every single Democratic
administration has shrunk it since
1981—Reagan, deficit increased; H. W.,
deficit increased; Bill Clinton, deficit
goes down; George Bush, deficit in-
creased; Obama, deficit goes down;
Donald Trump, deficit going up. What
does that say?
So, to the Wall Street Journal edi-
torial board and my Republican friends
who are silent about Trump-era defi-
cits but rail against domestic spending,
I say: Spare us. Enough. Enough with
this deficit hypocrisy.
f
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, fi-
nally, on climate, I want to congratu-
late my dear friend, one of the most in-
telligent, hard-working, articulate
Senators we have, SHELDON WHITE-
HOUSE, on reaching a rhetorical mile-
stone. Usually ‘‘rhetoric’’ and ‘‘mile-
stone’’ don’t go together, but in his
strong eloquence on the environment,
they do.
Yesterday, Senator WHITEHOUSE gave
his 250th speech on the subject of cli-
mate change. Many Members of this
Chamber have yet to speak 250 times
on the floor in total, much less on a
single topic. Senator WHITEHOUSE’s
speeches have covered everything from
sea level rise to polar cap ice melting
and the effect of climate change on our
economic security and our national se-
curity. He has diligently shone a light
on the impediments to legislative
progress on climate change, and he
waxes fervent and poetic, condemning
the web of dark money that funds
fraudulent climate research and lob-
bies against climate action.
Much more important than Senator
WHITEHOUSE’s milestone, of course, is
the issue he is talking about. Each
passing week brings another proof
point that climate change is happening

right now and reshaping our planet for
the worse, moving so quickly that, at
some point, we will not be able to re-
cover no matter what we do.
The world will be so much worse for
our children and grandchildren. I think
of my 8-month-old—just turned 8
months on the 24th—my little grand-
son. Will his world be the same as ours?
Will it be just as beautiful, or will it be
flooding and fires and changes that
make his life and the lives of his whole
generation far more difficult? If we do
nothing, that will happen.
Carbon levels in the atmosphere are
at the highest point ever in human his-
tory. Just days ago, NBC reported that
this will be the hottest July on record.
Last month, June, was the hottest
June on record.
We all know the consequences will be
devastating, just devastating to our
planet if we fail to take action soon. It
is time for the Senate to debate seri-
ous, significant policies to address cli-
mate change. And, parenthetically, it
is another place MCCONNELL’S legisla-
tive graveyard unfortunately gains—
gains more and more. He will not do
anything on climate change, as impor-
tant as it is.
Let me thank Senator WHITEHOUSE
for his leadership on this issue. Maybe
Leader MCCONNELL will read his 250
speeches and have a change of heart. I
doubt it, but who knows? I wish that
all of my colleagues on the other side
would listen to him and join Democrats
in our efforts to pass legislation to
combat climate change.
f
PUERTO RICO
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, fi-
nally, one more point on Puerto Rico.
Last night, the Governor of Puerto
Rico, Ricardo Rossello, announced he
will resign on August 2. I am glad that
the Governor has listened to the voices
of the people of Puerto Rico. It is clear
he lost their trust, their respect, and
certainly the mandate to govern. The
most important thing now is a quick
and orderly transition of power so that
our fellow citizens on the island can
turn the page on this difficult chapter
and move forward.
No matter what, we have to stand
with the people of Puerto Rico. The is-
land is still a far way off from recovery
after the devastation of recent hurri-
canes. It is essential that the local
Puerto Rican economy continue to re-
cover and that basic services performed
by the government continue undis-
turbed as that process continues.
As a new Governor enters office, we
pledge to do whatever we can to ensure
the people of Puerto Rico receive the
aid and the support they need. We
fought incredibly hard on the disaster
bill to make sure the people of Puerto
Rico are not treated worse than any
other U.S. citizens. The events of the
past 2 weeks should in no way inhibit
that aid from reaching the island
quickly and efficiently. It is so badly
needed. I will be watching and doing
everything in my power to guarantee
that is the case.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk

f
MORNING BUSINESS
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the
Senate will be in morning business,
with Senators permitted to speak
therein for up to 10 minutes each.
The Senator from Washington.
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I
come to the floor today to sound once
again the alarm against Republicans’
efforts to throw the lives of millions of
families into chaos and uncertainty
and to urge my colleagues to reverse
course and join Democrats to protect
people’s healthcare before it is too
late.
A few weeks ago, President Trump
and Republican attorneys general ar-
gued in court to create a healthcare
crisis for families in our country. If Re-
publicans win their blatantly partisan
lawsuit, the consequences could be
sweeping and devastating. Tens of mil-
lions of people who have healthcare
coverage through Medicaid Expansion
or the exchanges could lose it, as could
many young adults who are on their
parents’ insurance.
Over 100 million people with pre-
existing conditions could lose protec-
tions that stop insurance companies
from charging them more, excluding
benefits they need or denying them
coverage entirely. Patients could lose
protections that require insurers to
cover essential health benefits like pre-
scription drug costs, maternity care,
emergency care, or mental healthcare
and more. Limits on how much pa-
tients have to pay out of pocket could
go away, while lifetime and annual
caps on patients’ benefits could come
back even to those insured through
their employers.
Republicans have refused to acknowl-
edge what is actually at stake now for
the patients and families whose health
they are putting at risk, and they have
made it all too clear that despite the
horrible consequences they are setting
up, despite the lives they are throwing
needlessly into jeopardy, Republicans
are going to go full steam ahead with
this reckless lawsuit to strike down
healthcare for millions and without
any plan to do anything if they win.
Some Republicans have tried to
dodge this fact by saying they will fig-
ure it out after they win. That is an in-
credibly telling and incredibly alarm-
ing position. It is about as comforting
as an arsonist telling you he will re-
build your house after he burns it
down.
Let’s be clear. Republicans have no
plans for the patients who lose their
coverage, no plans for the families who
will see their healthcare costs go up,
and no plans for people nationwide who
rely on these protections for pre-
existing conditions that could be taken
away. They have no plan for all the
people who will be hurt by the damage
they are fighting to cause, and families
expect better. They deserve better.
This is not rocket science. People
want us to protect their healthcare,
not take it away. They want us to
bring healthcare costs down, not send
them certainly higher. They want us to
fight for them, not against them.
Republicans have made the wrong
choice time and again. So I call on my
Republican colleagues to stop this
chaos and work with us. Let’s fight for
patients before it is too late. The clock
is ticking, and patients and families
are watching closely. If Republicans in
the Trump administration refuse to
end this partisan lawsuit, families and
patients will be the ones who suffer the
consequences, and they will not forget
the Republicans who stood by and
cheered and let it happen.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll.

MOON-MARS DEVELOPMENT
PROJECT
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, those of
us who have had a chance over some
time now to work with the former
Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich,
know that he is a man of ideas and is
often thinking well beyond the mo-
ment. I had a chance the other day to
read a paper that he prepared on Presi-
dent Trump’s Moon-Mars Development
Project, and I want to borrow heavily
from his thinking as I talk about this
project today.
It is an important time. We just
spent significant time remembering,
appreciating, and looking back at the
50th anniversary of American astro-
nauts landing on the Moon and return-
ing safely. Fifty years goes more
quickly than you might think.
But for the first time in that 50
years, we are really at a point where
there is a chance that we could cease
to be the leading power in space. We
decided we were going to become the
leading power in space; we became the
leading power in space; we have been
the leading power in space. But that is

not necessarily a given, and you can
last only so long living on your past
accomplishments.
President Trump, on the Fourth of
July, made this comment: ‘‘I want you
to know that we are going to be back
on the moon very soon, and someday
soon we will plant an American flag on
Mars.’’
My guess is that was received with
sort of the same amount of skepticism
as President Kennedy’s challenge was
more than 50 years ago. There is no
question that the Artemis Project that
President Trump is talking about is
not the Apollo Project 50 years later.
This is no longer an effort just to go
somewhere and get back. We know we
can do that. It is an effort to look at
where we might go next and why we
might benefit from that.
In May of 1961, President Kennedy
challenged the Congress by saying we
‘‘should commit [ourselves] to achiev-
ing the goal’’—talking about the goal
of getting to the Moon—we ‘‘should
commit [ourselves] to achieving the
goal, before this decade is out, of land-
ing a man on the Moon and returning
him safely to Earth.’’
There was pretty heavy skepticism. I
think 58 percent of the American peo-
ple polled said they were opposed to
doing that. Why would we send some-
body to the Moon and worry about
whether we could get them there? Of
course, if we got them there, we would
want to get them back. There was
great skepticism.
So a little over a year later at Rice
University, President Kennedy tried
again. He said: ‘‘We choose to go to the
Moon in this decade and do the other
things, not because they are easy, but
because they are hard.’’
That is one of his famous quotes. If
you look back at President Kennedy’s
challenge to the country, you hear it:
We are going not because it is easy, but
because it is hard.
He went on to say ‘‘because that goal
will serve to organize and measure the
best of our energies and skills, because
that challenge is one that we are will-
ing to accept, one we are unwilling to
postpone, and one we intend to win.’’
There is nothing wrong with an
America that wants to win. There is
nothing wrong with an America that
doesn’t want to take second place.
There is nothing wrong with an Amer-
ica that wants to set a standard that
everybody else can hope to achieve.
We had been caught a little flat-foot-
ed in the midfifties when the Russians
put a satellite in space—Sputnik.
Americans would go out and see if they
could measure when it was passing
over because they had put something
up there that appeared to be there per-
petually.
Then there was a cosmonaut in
space. President Kennedy said that we
don’t want to accept anything more
than the opportunity to meet big chal-
lenges and show what we can do to test
ourselves.
The Vice President of the United
States, Vice President PENCE, said at
the National Space Council in Hunts-
ville, AL, on March 26 of this year that
‘‘50 years ago, ‘one small step for man’
became ‘one giant leap for mankind.’ ’’
You really had to be trying to avoid
it not to hear that quote last week as
it was being repeated over and over
again. The Vice President said that
now it’s come time for us to ‘‘make the
next ‘giant leap’ and return American
astronauts to the Moon, establish a
permanent base there, and develop the
technologies to take American astro-
nauts to Mars and beyond.’’
That’s the next ‘‘giant leap.’’
You will note here that the direct
connection between Moon development
and going to Mars, as the President put
it, is there. It is the reason to go back
to the Moon. It is the reason to do
what we can to understand the Moon.
Our goal is not just getting to the
Moon. Of course, we have already done
that. Our goal is to be there and to do
that in a way that works for us.
John Marburger, President George W.
Bush’s science adviser, said in 2006:
‘‘The Moon is the closest source of ma-
terial that lies far up Earth’s gravity
well.’’
This is the closest place we can go
and get material that can be used with
3D printing and all sorts of things that
are possible to construct on the Moon
that weren’t possible to construct any-
where in that same way just a few
years ago.
The first phase of science on the
Moon would be a lot like exploring
Antarctica. I haven’t been to Antarc-
tica. I would like to go sometime. We
don’t have people on Antarctica be-
cause Antarctica is an easy place to
live; we have people staying all the
time on Antarctica to see what we
could learn by being on the continent
of Antarctica all the time. The next
phase of the Moon would be like that,
with people going to the Moon, staying
on the Moon, and looking at opportuni-
ties on the parts of the Moon where we
believe there is ice. I know the formula
for this. If you have ice, you probably
have some form of water. If you have
water, lots of things can happen that
might not happen otherwise.
This is a project that will inspire
others to want to be part of it, whether
it is Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk or Rich-
ard Branson or Paul Allen—who has
passed on, but was intrigued by the
Moon. They are all people who have
great private resources.
America was founded on a public-pri-
vate model. Jamestown, Plimouth
Plantation, and the East India Com-
pany all had private individuals with
government sponsorship trying to
make something happen that wouldn’t
happen otherwise. That, I suggest, can
happen on the Moon.
In Newt Gingrich’s telling of the
challenge on the Moon, he repeated
that great story of what happened at
Wollman Rink and how it might relate
to what could happen on the Moon if
you are not bound by the normal
things that bind a lot of people. Every
person thinking about the Moon-Mars
project, according to former Speaker
Gingrich, should look at what Donald
Trump did at the Wollman Rink. The
Wollman Rink was a very popular site
for ice skating in New York City in
1980 when it broke down. It totally
broke down. The city of New York
spent 6 years and $13 million trying to
fix the ice rink. Fortunately, I guess,
for the city of New York and ice skat-
ers who go there, the abandoned ice
rink happened to be within sight of
President Trump’s apartment. He kept
complaining about the ice rink and the
failure of the city to do anything about
the ice rink. Finally, Mayor Koch said
to Donald Trump: Why don’t you fix it
if you think this is so easily done? And
he did. He fixed the ice rink in 4
months for $2.25 million. I remember
the city had already spent $13 million
and failed to fix the ice rink.
The first year after the ice rink was
fixed, 225,000 people skated on the ice
rink. One reason the President was
able to do that as a private citizen was
that he wasn’t bound by the things
that bind most people. He wasn’t bound
by the things that bind the govern-
ment. The historic project to fix the
Wollman Rink achieved the goal at 1/5
the cost and 1/18 the time that the city
had used and did not get it done, and
ice skaters flourished.
The same kinds of things could hap-
pen if we looked beyond the normal
boundaries of what could happen in
this project that the President has
talked about.
Remember, on the effort to get to the
Moon, President Kennedy turned that
project over to Vice President Johnson
and said: You are going to be in charge
of NASA, and you are going to be the
point person on the Moon project. So
there is a little history there that may
be repeating itself when, in March this
year in Huntsville, AL, the Vice Presi-
dent outlined the principles we could
use to meet the goals that the Presi-
dent had established for our efforts in
space.
Principle No. 1 was to establish a big
goal and then stick to it. Remember,
we went to the Moon to start with, not
because it was easy, but because it was
hard. Establish a big goal, then stick
to it. ‘‘Failure to achieve our goal to
return an American astronaut to the
Moon in the next 5 years is not an op-
tion,’’ according to the Vice President.
Principle No. 2, Be prepared to reach
outside the traditional bureaucracy to
new, entrepreneurial, private compa-
nies if it is necessary to get the job
done. He went on to say:
[W]e’re not committed to any one con-
tractor. If our current contractors can’t
meet this objective, then we’ll find ones that
will. If American industry can provide crit-
ical commercial services without govern-
ment development, then we’ll buy them.
We will buy into that project and
share it with them. If commercial
rockets are the only way to get Amer-
ican astronauts to the Moon in the
next 5 years, then commercial rockets
will be the way we return to the Moon.

S5078 July 25, 2019
Principle No. 3, Be willing to change
the bureaucracy rather than abandon
the goal.
[W]e will call on NASA not just to adopt
new policies but to embrace a new mindset.
That begins with setting bold goals and stay-
ing on schedule.
A new mindset matters. Failure is
not an option. The willingness to post-
pone our goal, as President Kennedy
said almost 60 years ago, is not an op-
tion.
Principle No. 4, Be determined to
change the bureaucracy in funda-
mental ways.
NASA must transform itself into a leaner,
more accountable, and more agile organiza-
tion. If NASA is not currently capable of
landing American astronauts [men and
women] on the Moon in five years, we need
to change the organization, not the mission.
By the way, as for principle No. 5, I
know, in the Presiding Officer’s case, it
is coming from private business and
might be his most important principle.
Principle No. 5, Urgency must re-
place complacency.
The hardest thing to achieve in gov-
ernment is just to drive to a result.
The fifth principle that the Vice Presi-
dent set out is exactly that. It is not
just competition against our adver-
saries; it is, frankly, competition
against our worst enemy—compla-
cency. It is competition against our
own willingness to believe that things
aren’t going to happen that clearly can
happen.
This is a great goal. It is a step to the
Moon and beyond. It is a step outside
our solar system to other solar sys-
tems. In our lifetimes, we may not see
much of that, but this is not about our
lifetimes; this is about a step into the
future.
I applaud the President and the Vice
President for their leadership here. I
look forward to applying those five
principles. By the way, I think almost
all of those principles are five prin-
ciples we could apply to government
every day, and we would have a more
effective government if we would.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mi-
nority leader.
f
ELECTION SECURITY
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have
a unanimous consent request. I know
my colleague from Connecticut has one
as well. In deference to the leader’s
schedule, I will speak for a few minutes
on mine, and then I will yield to Sen-
ator BLUMENTHAL. He will speak for a
few minutes on his, and then we will
wait for the leader, who is supposed to
come out in about 5 minutes, to object,
if he so chooses. We will make the re-
quest after that.
Now, yesterday, everybody heard
Special Counsel Mueller, and there was
a lot of dispute about obstruction of
justice and things like that. There was
virtually no dispute about two facts
that Mueller said. One, the Russians
interfered in our elections in 2016, and,
two, they plan to do it in 2020.
We rise on the floor because, when
Russia or any foreign power seeks to
interfere in our elections, it eats at the
wellsprings of our democracy.
The Founding Fathers, in their wis-
dom, said that one of the greatest
threats to our democracy was foreign
interference. Now we are faced with the
specter of it, and we are asking our Re-
publican colleagues to join with us in
doing everything we can to stop it.
This is serious stuff.
Mr. Mueller said yesterday:
Russian interference wasn’t a single at-
tempt. They are doing it as we sit here, and
they expect to do it in the next campaign.
That is Robert Mueller, one of the
most authoritative voices on this issue.
Mueller warned that ‘‘much more
needs to be done’’ to fortify against fu-
ture attacks, not just from Russia but
from others looking to interfere in our
elections as well.
Mr. Mueller is not the only one call-
ing for action on election security. FBI
Director Wray, appointed by President
Trump, has said the same. Director of
National Intelligence Coats, also ap-
pointed by President Trump, has
stressed that foreign actors ‘‘will add
new tactics as they learn from 2016.’’
So we must do more. This is not a
Democratic issue or a Republican
issue. This is not a liberal issue or a
moderate issue or conservative issue.
This is an issue of patriotism, of na-
tional security, of protecting the very
integrity of American democracy—
something so many of our forebears
died for.
And what do we hear from the Repub-
lican side? Nothing. There is no cre-
dence to the claim made by the leader
that we have already done enough in
this Chamber. Mueller, Wray, and
Coats all said that we need to do
more—all of them.
Here in the Senate, the Senate Intel-
ligence Committee, led by Senator
BURR of North Carolina, a Republican,
has recommended we do more. They
too say otherwise. Yet Leader MCCON-
NELL and the Republican majority
refuse to do anything.
So in a moment I am going to ask
unanimous consent to pass legislation
that safeguards our election. This leg-
islation passed the House nearly a
month ago. It would provide immediate
resources for the States to modernize
their election infrastructure and estab-
lish a consistent funding stream to
maintain it.
The States say they need more
money. It will require the use of paper
ballots. Almost every expert agrees
that that is needed to protect elections
from manipulation, because if they ma-
nipulate the machines, the paper bal-
lots will be a safeguard.
It would require States to conduct
postelection risk-limiting audits, and
it would shore up the cyber security of
voting systems and ensure that elec-
tion technology vendors are held to the
highest standards so the Russians or no
one else can hack into these machines
and interfere.
These are not revolutionary changes.
They are basic commonsense steps to
greatly improve the security of our
elections after President Putin con-
ducted a systemic attack on our de-
mocracy and intends to do it again.
The House has passed this bill al-
ready. We could deliver it to the Presi-
dent today.
Now, the Republican leader has al-
ready indicated his intention to bury
this bill in the legislative graveyard.
That is a disgrace. That would be as if
we said: We don’t need a military. We
don’t need ships off our shores or
planes in the air.
Attacks on our elections are as great
a threat to our national security as
any other, and yet, for reasons inex-
plicable, the Republican leader refuses
to bring legislation to the floor, legis-
lation that has been crafted in a bipar-
tisan way.
Many of the bills that are before us
have Democratic and Republican spon-
sors, and if the rumors are true, the
leader urged the Republicans to back
off.
There are only two inferences, nei-
ther good. One is that the Republican
side doesn’t care about interference in
our elections, and the other is that
they want it because maybe they think
it will benefit them.
I know that President Trump doesn’t
like to talk about this. He childishly
thinks this will cast aspersions on the
legitimacy of his election. That is sort
of a very babyish, selfish thing to
think when our security is at risk.
But where are our Republican col-
leagues when our national security is
threatened? Where are our Republican
colleagues? If we invite the Russians to
interfere by not doing enough and they
do and Americans lose faith in the fun-
damental wellspring of America, our
grand democracy, this is the beginning
of the end of democracy in this coun-
try.
As George Washington, James Madi-
son, and Benjamin Franklin warned us,
we must do all we can to prevent for-
eign interference in our elections. By
allowing this UC request to go through,
we will be taking a giant first step. I
hope the leader goes along.
And, again, if he says the States
don’t need it, the States say they do.
They are the judge.
I will be asking my request in a
minute, but first let me yield to Sen-
ator BLUMENTHAL, who will also have a
UC request.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut.
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I
thank my colleague from New York,
our distinguished leader, for his very
powerful and compelling remarks and
for his steadfast leadership on this
issue of election security.
The issue of election security goes to
the core of our national security. In
the last Presidential election, this Na-
tion was attacked. It was an attack as
pernicious and insidious as any in this
country’s history, although it was less

visible than bombs dropped at Pearl
Harbor and less dramatic than the at-
tacks on our troops elsewhere, whether
in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was an at-
tack on this Nation, and some of us
have called it, in fact, an act of war on
both sides of the aisle.
On both sides of the aisle there has
been unanimity, in fact, that the at-
tack was by the Russians through so-
cial media and through other means
and tools of misinformation and
disinformation to interfere with our
election. That unanimity comes not
only from Robert Mueller, a distin-
guished public servant and dedicated
American, but also from our entire in-
telligence community.
There is only one person in a position
of authority who disagrees, and that is
the President of the United States, who
finds Vladimir Putin more credible
than our intelligence community and
has said so publicly.
In a few moments, I will ask for
unanimous consent for the passage of
S. 1247, the Duty to Report Act, which
would address the President’s saying
very explicitly that he would accept
outside help from a foreign power,
again, in the course of an election.
The proof is overwhelming that the
Trump campaign accepted it in the last
election. But even disputing those
facts, even putting aside the Presi-
dent’s contention that there was never
an attack from the Russians, the opin-
ion is overwhelming that we must act
on a very simple idea: If you see some-
thing, say something.
The Duty to Report Act that I have
offered would require companies, can-
didates, and family members to imme-
diately report to the FBI and to the
Federal Election Commission any of-
fers of Federal assistance.
It codifies into law what is already—
I think we all agree—a moral duty, a
patriotic duty, a matter of common
sense. It is already illegal to accept
foreign assistance during a campaign.
It is already illegal to solicit foreign
assistance during a campaign.
All this bill does is require cam-
paigns and individuals to report such
illegal foreign assistance directly to
the FBI.
Yesterday, Robert Mueller came be-
fore Congress to answer questions
about his sweeping investigation and
448-page report. This report documents
compellingly and convincingly the
most serious attack on our democracy
by a foreign power in our history. It
tells the story of 140 contacts between
the Trump campaign and Russian
agents. It proves Russian covert and
overt efforts to influence the outcome
of our election by helping one can-
didate and hurting another. It shows
powerfully the Trump campaign’s
knowledge of that effort and willing-
ness to accept that help.
Mueller testified yesterday:
Over the course of my career, I’ve seen a
number of challenges to our democracy. The
Russian government’s effort to interfere in
our election is among the most serious. As I
said on May 29, this deserves the attention of
every American.
The legislation Senator SCHUMER is
offering through unanimous consent
now, the legislation that I am offering
by unanimous consent now, is nec-
essary as a matter of urgent national
security. We have no choice but to de-
fend our Nation and our democracy.
Given the sweeping, sophisticated at-
tack by the Russians outlined in the
Mueller report and confirmed by his
testimony yesterday, we have an obli-
gation to act now, as we would against
any impending attack in our history.
Just the day before yesterday, FBI
Director Christopher Wray came before
the Judiciary Committee and warned
that the Russians are actively trying
to interfere in our elections right now,
in real time, as we speak here. He has
told this body that if a foreign agent or
government tries to help a campaign,
the FBI would want to know about it.
That also is a matter of simple moral
duty, patriotic duty, and common
sense.
When asked if he would accept for-
eign help in 2020, the President said,
‘‘I’d take it.’’ This is much like when
his son, Don Junior, said ‘‘I love it’’ in
response to Russia’s offer of assistance
to the Trump campaign in the June 9th
meeting now infamous in these Halls
and in the country.
When Mueller was asked about this
yesterday, he said, ‘‘I hope this is not
the new normal, but I fear it is.’’ Well,
it doesn’t have to be the new normal if
Congress passes the Duty to Report
Act. This legislation would ensure that
if any campaign—literally any cam-
paign—were offered any assistance
from any foreign government in any fu-
ture election, the FBI would learn of it.
Mr. President, 2016 was just a dress
rehearsal. We can expect that the same
will happen with greater intensity and
sophistication in the election to come.
We have a duty to act against it—tak-
ing the measure sent to us by the
House of Representatives, introduced
for unanimous consent by Senator
SCHUMER now, and the Duty to Report
Act now—so that we protect our de-
mocracy going forward.
Mr. President, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to have printed in
the RECORD a letter from 21 attorneys
general saying they need more election
assistance to protect against foreign
interference.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
STATE OF MINNESOTA,
OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL,
St. Paul, MN, June 18, 2019.
Hon. RICHARD SHELBY,
Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations,
Washington, DC.
Hon. ROY BLUNT,
Chairman, Senate Committee on Rules and Ad-
ministration, Washington, DC.
Hon. PATRICK LEAHY,
Vice Chair, Senate Committee on Appropria-
tions, Washington, DC.
Hon. AMY KLOBUCHAR,
Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Rules
and Administration, Washington, DC.
DEAR HONORABLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS:
The undersigned Attorneys General write to
express our significant concern regarding the
persistent threats to our election systems
and to urge Congress to take action to pro-
tect the integrity of our election infrastruc-
ture.
Intelligence officials and the Department
of Justice continue to warn that our election
systems have been a target for foreign adver-
saries and that those same adversaries are
currently working to undermine the upcom-
ing elections. The Special Counsel’s Report
concludes that Russia interfered in our elec-
tions in a ‘‘sweeping and systematic fash-
ion.’’ New reports confirm that Russia suc-
cessfully breached election systems in Flor-
ida and the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity is reviewing computers used in North
Carolina after the state experienced irreg-
ularities on Election Day. In addition, docu-
ments leaked by the National Security Agen-
cy show that hackers working for Russian
military intelligence installed malware on a
voting systems software company used in
eight states, including North Carolina. Rus-
sia’s military intelligence service also broad-
ly performed reconnaissance on state and
local election boards, researched—and in
some cases targeted—the election infrastruc-
ture of all 50 states, successfully invaded
state election websites to steal sensitive in-
formation from tens of thousands of Amer-
ican voters, and hacked into a company that
supplies voting software to states across the
U.S.
In the wake of these attacks on our democ-
racy, the Congress and Federal Government
have taken some important steps to address
the threats facing our democracy. The De-
partment of Homeland Security is working
with states to improve election security, and
in the 2018 Omnibus, Congress provided $380
million in grant funding to help states se-
cure their election systems. The Election As-
sistance Commission, the federal agency
charged with disseminating and auditing the
election security grants, projects that states
will spend approximately $324 million, or 85
percent of the grant funds, prior to the 2020
elections. This funding was an important
first step in helping to secure our election
infrastructure, however more must be done.
Our state and local election officials are on
the front-lines of the fight to protect our
election infrastructure, but they lack the re-
sources necessary to combat a sophisticated
foreign adversary like Russia. Therefore, we
respectfully request that you provide addi-
tional assistance to states seeking to mod-
ernize their elections systems and take the
following actions to protect our elections
from future attacks:
Provide additional election security grants
to states and localities. Today, more than at
any other time in our nation’s history, elec-
tion officials face unique challenges that re-
quire access to federal financial support. Ad-
ditional funding for voting infrastructure
will not only allow states to upgrade elec-
tion equipment and voter registration sys-
tems and databases, it will allow them to
further fortify their election systems from

future cyberattacks. Sustained federal fund-
ing is necessary to pay for continued train-
ing, equipment replacements, software up-
grades and implementation of security con-
trols. This funding is vital if we are to ade-
quately equip our states with the resources
we need to safeguard our democracy.
Support the establishment of cybersecu-
rity and audit standards for election sys-
tems. It is critical that the federal govern-
ment work with elections officials and tech-
nical experts to establish guidelines and best
practices for election security. We believe
that the U.S. Election Assistance Commis-
sion should update its standards for voting
machines and take a stronger regulatory
role in testing voting equipment before it is
sold to states. The federal government
should also keep state elections officials
closely informed about suspected breaches,
alerts, and related intelligence. There should
be clear channels of communication so that
local and state officials can share informa-
tion with federal authorities.
Pass election-security legislation. Last
year, a group of state attorneys general
voiced support for the Secure Elections Act,
bipartisan legislation that would improve in-
formation sharing and strengthen election
security. We reiterate our support for action
on election security reform. The National
Association of Secretaries of State and our
state elections officials can be a valuable re-
source as Congress considers specific pro-
posals.
The nature of the threat against our elec-
tion systems requires the federal govern-
ment to provide increased assistance to the
states. Securing our election systems is a
matter of national security and we hope that
you will take immediate action to protect
our election infrastructure and restore
Americans’ trust in our election systems.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 2722
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the Rules
Committee be discharged from further
consideration of H.R. 2722, the SAFE
Act; that the Senate proceed to its im-
mediate consideration; that the bill be
read a third time and passed; and that
the motion to reconsider be considered
made and laid upon the table with no
intervening action of debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The majority leader.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, what my
friend the Democratic leader is asking
unanimous consent to pass is partisan
legislation from the Democratic House
of Representatives relating to Amer-
ican elections. This is the same Demo-
cratic House that made its first big pri-
ority in this Congress a sweeping par-
tisan effort to rewrite all kinds of the
rules of American politics—not to
achieve greater fairness but to give
themselves a one-sided political ben-
efit.
The particular bill the Democratic
leader is asking to move by unanimous
consent is so partisan that it received
one—just one—Republican vote over in
the House. Clearly, this request is not
a serious effort to make a law. Clearly,
something so partisan that it only re-
ceived one single solitary Republican
vote in the House is not going to travel
through the Senate by unanimous con-
sent.
It is very important that we main-
tain the integrity and security of our
elections in our country. Any Wash-
ington involvement in that task needs
to be undertaken with extreme care
and on a thoroughly bipartisan basis.
Obviously, this legislation is not that.
It is just a highly partisan bill from
the same folks who spent 2 years
hyping up a conspiracy theory about
President Trump and Russia and who
continue to ignore this administra-
tion’s progress in correcting the Obama
administration’s failures on this sub-
ject in the 2018 election; therefore, I ob-
ject.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Democratic leader.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, just
for a moment, there are bipartisan bills
on this issue which the Republican ma-
jority has objected to. I suggest to my
friend the majority leader, if he doesn’t
like this bill, let’s put another bill on
the floor and debate it. So far, we have
done nothing—absolutely nothing in
this Chamber to protect our country
and its election security.
I yield the floor.

ator from Connecticut.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1247
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I
have a separate bill. It has not come to
us from the House, but it should have
bipartisan support.
I ask unanimous consent that the
Rules Committee be discharged from
further consideration of S. 1247; that
the Senate proceed to its immediate
consideration; that the bill be read a
third time and passed; and that the
motion to reconsider be considered
made and laid upon the table with no
intervening action or debate.

objection?
Mr. MCCONNELL. I object.

FISCHER). Objection is heard.

BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
for the information of all of our col-
leagues, I want to provide an update on
the remaining items the Senate needs
to complete before we adjourn for the
August State work period.
Here is what we need to accomplish
before Members depart next week: We
need to confirm well-qualified nomi-
nees to two open positions of utmost
importance—the Deputy Secretary of
Defense and our Ambassador to the
U.N. These jobs are important, the
nominees are impressive, and we need
to confirm David Norquist and Kelly
Craft next week.
Obviously, we need to pass the bipar-
tisan funding agreement that President
Trump’s negotiating team worked out
with Speaker PELOSI. The House will
pass it today. The President is strongly
in support of it. The Senate needs to
pass it and put it on the President’s
desk next week.
We need to make more headway on
the backlog of qualified judicial nomi-
nees who are waiting for confirmation,
so next week we will also need to proc-
ess a significant, bipartisan package of
district court nominees.
That is our to-do list for next week—
the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the
U.N. Ambassador, the bipartisan gov-
ernment funding agreement, and a sig-
nificant group of well-qualified judges.
Not bad for a week’s work. That is
what the Senate will accomplish before
we adjourn for August.

MUELLER REPORT
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President,
yesterday the American people finally
heard at length directly from Special
Counsel Robert Mueller. In his testi-
mony before the House Judiciary Com-
mittee and the Intelligence Com-
mittee, the special counsel gave voice
to his report on Russian interference in
our 2016 Presidential election and
President Trump’s obstruction of the
investigation into it.
What the American people and I
heard from Special Counsel Mueller
was an explanation and confirmation of
the deeply troubling findings and con-
clusions of his investigation and his
written report. He told us that the
Trump campaign welcomed the help of
a hostile foreign power, Russia, to in-
fluence our 2016 election, accepted that
help, lied repeatedly about it, and ben-
efited from it.
He confirmed that there was volumi-
nous evidence that President Trump
had obstructed justice through his ef-
forts to interfere with and impede the
special counsel’s investigation. Most
importantly, contrary to the Presi-
dent’s claims, the special counsel con-
firmed that his investigation had not
exonerated the President of the crime
of obstruction of justice. When asked,
Robert Mueller made this crystal clear,

SENATE
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5085

testifying that ‘‘the President was not
exculpated for the acts that he alleg-
edly committed.’’
In his testimony yesterday, Special
Counsel Mueller did not back away
from any of his written report’s find-
ings. The American people saw and
heard him emphatically defend them.
Special Counsel Mueller, a decorated
war hero, gave every single American
cause for deep alarm when he called
Russian interference in support of the
Trump campaign ‘‘among the most se-
rious challenges’’ to American democ-
racy that he had ever seen.
He agreed that it was ‘‘unpatriotic’’
and ‘‘wrong’’ to seek campaign help
from a foreign power, and he decried
President Trump’s failure to acknowl-
edge or respond to the systematic and
sweeping Russian interference, warn-
ing: ‘‘They’re doing it as we sit here.’’
Yesterday, Donald Trump tried to de-
fend himself in tweets while Robert
Mueller defended our democracy with
his testimony.
The special counsel’s testimony and
events of the past few weeks have led
to the undeniable conclusion that it is
time for the House of Representatives
to begin a formal impeachment pro-
ceeding against President Trump.
I stand here today on the Senate
floor, the place where an unprece-
dented trial would occur, under-
standing the gravity of this moment in
our Nation’s history. I stand here
today because I believe we have
reached the moment where we must
stand up for the survival of our democ-
racy.
Before I came to this decision, I said
that I needed to hear directly from
Special Counsel Mueller and other wit-
nesses, that Congress needed to obtain
documents, and that we needed to
gather all the facts and evidence.
I had hoped that the House Judiciary
Committee’s investigation would get
us answers to the questions about the
President’s obstructive conduct that
remained after Special Counsel Mueller
issued his report. I had hoped that the
President, who continues to insist that
he did nothing wrong, would cooperate
and that the House Judiciary Com-
mittee would receive testimony and
other evidence from the Trump cam-
paign and Trump administration wit-
nesses. That has not happened, and
that is because of continued and delib-
erate Presidential obstruction.
Just listen to the numerous road-
blocks that the President has put in
Congress’s way since Special Counsel
Mueller issued his report in March.
President Trump has denied the entire
Congress access to the full and
unredacted version of the Mueller re-
port and its underlying materials.
President Trump has claimed that
key witnesses, like former White House
Counsel Donald McGahn and former
White House Communications Director
Hope Hicks, are immune from testi-
fying or simply don’t have to comply
with congressional subpoenas.
President Trump has opposed testi-
mony from two of the special counsel’s
top deputies and restricted the scope of
the Mueller testimony, and President
Trump has vowed to fight any future
congressional subpoenas.
What we have seen from President
Trump is a pattern of repeated and
baseless defiance of the House’s con-
stitutional authority to investigate,
especially subpoenas seeking evidence
that the President obstructed justice
and abused his power.
The President has engaged in
stonewalling that shows an unprece-
dented disregard and contempt for a
coequal branch of government under
our Constitution—disregard and con-
tempt that would make Richard Nixon
blush with envy.
Taken together, Special Counsel Rob-
ert Mueller’s testimony and the Presi-
dent’s obstruction of the congressional
investigation compel us to imme-
diately begin a formal impeachment
inquiry.
I do not come to this decision lightly.
An impeachment proceeding against
the President of the United States is a
matter of the highest constitutional
magnitude, but when the evidence dem-
onstrates that the President of the
United States obstructed the special
counsel’s investigation and when the
facts and the evidence demonstrate
that the President of the United States
is continuing to obstruct justice, seek-
ing to derail a legitimate congressional
investigation into the lawfulness of his
conduct while in office, then Congress
must do its constitutional duty and
act.
The acts of obstruction that Special
Counsel Mueller described in his report
and in his testimony yesterday to Con-
gress are impeachable offenses—a view
shared by myriad constitutional schol-
ars, attorneys, and prosecutors.
The President improperly pressed
then-FBI Director James Comey to
drop the investigation of former Na-
tional Security Advisor Michael Flynn
and, subsequently, fired Comey because
of the Russia investigation—confirmed
yesterday by the special counsel’s tes-
timony.
The President unlawfully demanded
that then-Attorney General Jeff Ses-
sions reverse his recusal from the Rus-
sia investigation and take over the in-
vestigation—confirmed yesterday by
the special counsel’s testimony.
The President engaged in witness
tampering and falsification of govern-
ment records when he directed White
House Counsel Don McGahn to fire
Robert Mueller and later pressured
McGahn to deny that it had happened—
confirmed yesterday by the special
counsel’s testimony.
The President engaged in a coverup
when he sought to prevent public dis-
closure of evidence about the infamous
June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting—
confirmed yesterday by the special
counsel’s testimony.
The President abused his constitu-
tional authority by holding out the
prospect of pardons in exchange for
witnesses’ silence—confirmed yester-
day by the special counsel’s testimony.
That Robert Mueller found so much
evidence that this President com-
mitted impeachable offenses might be
shocking, but it should not be sur-
prising. After all, look at what we have
learned about this President during his
21⁄2 years in office, what he is willing to
say and what he is willing to do.
Did an American President put fam-
ily members in high-level White House
policy positions—positions requiring
security clearances that should never
have been issued? Yes, he did.
Did an American President repeat-
edly show infatuation with and express
sympathy for authoritarian figures
around the globe, most notably Vladi-
mir Putin, the man who interfered
with the 2016 election to President
Trump’s benefit? Yes, he did.
Did an American President face mul-
tiple, repeated, and credible allegations
of sexual assault by more than a dozen
women—sexual assault that he bragged
about on tape? Yes, he did.
Did an American President become
known as individual No. 1, in effect an
unindicted coconspirator on charges of
Federal campaign finance law viola-
tions that were brought against his
lawyer, Michael Cohen, in New York?
Yes, he did.
Did an American President seek to
divide Americans based on race, reli-
gion, and ethnicity, directing racist
language at elected Members of Con-
gress and urging others to celebrate
that hate? Sadly, yes, he did.
We have watched as Donald Trump
has given the Constitution a stress
test, the likes of which we haven’t seen
in 230 years. We have watched him at-
tack judges and seek to intimidate the
judiciary.
We have watched him disregard
Congress’s coequal role in government
under article I of the Constitution,
whether by spending unappropriated
money on his border wall, relying on
‘‘acting’’ government officials to evis-
cerate the Senate’s advice and consent
function, or ignoring legitimate over-
sight requests.
We have watched the President sue
Congress in order to block release of
his tax returns and refuse to disclose
any meaningful information about his
business operations, especially sources
of foreign investment and loans, rais-
ing alarming questions about viola-
tions of the Constitution’s emoluments
clause.
This President relishes attacking the
freedom of the press and has incited vi-
olence against journalists for exer-
cising their First Amendment rights.
Donald Trump is tearing at the fabric
of our democracy, literally, every sin-
gle day. And yesterday, the Congress
and the American people heard the
facts and evidence that Congress can
and should act to hold him account-
able.
In the face of impeachable offenses,
it is the Constitution that entrusts the
Congress with the responsibility of de-
ciding whether to remove a President
of the United States from office for

high crimes and misdemeanors. Indeed,
in the face of evidence of serious and
persistent misconduct that is harmful
to the Nation, Congress would be abus-
ing its constitutional discretion and
setting a dangerous precedent if it did
not begin an impeachment inquiry.
If the evidence of obstruction of jus-
tice and other wrongdoing that Robert
Mueller explained yesterday is not evi-
dence of impeachable offenses, what is?
What damage would a future President
have to inflict in order to trigger an
impeachment inquiry?
I have no illusions about where an
impeachment inquiry will lead. My Re-
publican colleagues have thus far
shown themselves unwilling to hold
this President accountable. They be-
lieve that everything is ‘‘all over.’’ But
the evidence in the Mueller report and
the special counsel’s testimony yester-
day explaining it, defending it, and re-
affirming it compel us to do what is
right and what is necessary, and that is
to exercise our authority and begin an
impeachment proceeding against Don-
ald Trump. Nothing less than our de-
mocracy is at stake. I call upon my
colleagues in the House of Representa-
tives to do so.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee.
BUDGET AGREEMENT
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President,
I have one message for my colleagues
in the Senate and those who might be
watching. It is about this chart, which
is very simple. This is the line of what
we call discretionary spending. This is
about 31 percent of the budget. That is
the budget agreement you have read
about in the newspapers the last couple
of days. That is what we are talking
about.
It is a blue line. It has to do with
paying for our national defense, so it is
about half of the dollars; then for our
national parks, America’s best idea;
then for the National Institutes of
Health, the source of medical miracles
ranging from restoring your heart to
curing Zika to the National Labora-
tories, which are the sources of our
competition with the rest of the world.
That is what this money is for.
What the blue line recognizes is that
for the last 10 years, the growth in
spending for national defense, national
parks, the National Institutes of
Health, and National Labs has gone up
at about the rate of inflation, and for
the next 10 years, including the budget
agreement that the President and the
congressional leaders recommended
this week, it will go at about the rate
of inflation.
The point is, for 20 years—2008 to
2029—the increase in spending for the
amount of money we are talking about
and for the type of spending in the
budget agreement is not the source of
the Federal deficit. What is? Medicare,
Medicaid, Social Security, and inter-
est—that is the red line that 10 years
ago was $1.8 trillion. At the rate we are
going, it will be $5.4 trillion in 10 years.
That is not the type of spending we are
talking about in the budget agreement.
My message today is in support of
properly funding national defense, na-
tional parks, National Institutes of
Health, and National Labs and not
beating our chest and pretending that
we are balancing the budget on the
backs of our soldiers, our medical mir-
acles, and our national parks when, in
fact, it is the entitlements that the
President and the Democrats and the
Republicans in Congress need to ad-
dress.
I will talk about the blue line today.
I have talked about the red line plenty
before. Former Senator Corker and I
introduced legislation a few years ago
that would have reduced the growth of
this red line by $1 trillion over 10
years. The only problem was, we were
the only two cosponsors of the legisla-
tion.
The budget deficit is vitally dam-
aging to our country, but the budget
agreement that President Trump rec-
ommended is not the source of the
budget deficit. That part of the budget
is under control. That is 31 percent of
all the dollars we spend in the United
States. Just add to that, if this con-
tinues for another 10 years, this blue
line—national defense, national parks,
National Institutes of Health, National
Laboratories—is going to go from 31
percent of the budget to 22 percent of
the budget, and mandatory spending is
going up to 78 percent. This is the
budget deficit. This is the budget
agreement we are going to be voting on
next week. That part of the budget is
under control.
Here is what the budget agreement,
which the President recommended and
our Democratic and Republican leaders
in the House and Senate have rec-
ommended and which I strongly sup-
port, does. The first thing it does is
suspend the debt limit—the amount we
can borrow. If we don’t do that, we
have a global fiscal crisis. We all know
that, so we need to do it.
Second, it raises the defense and non-
defense discretionary budget caps.
That is this blue line down here. That
is the amount of money we can spend,
as I said, on national defense. That is
about half of the spending—and then
our veterans, National Labs, bio-
medical research, and national parks.
Let’s talk about the military for just
a minute. Former Secretary of Defense
James Mattis, who had enormous re-
spect here in Congress, said that ‘‘no
enemy in the field has done as much
harm to the readiness of the U.S. mili-
tary than the combined impact of the
Budget Control Act’s defense spending
caps, worsened by operating for 10 of
the last 11 years under continuing reso-
lutions of varied and unpredictable du-
ration.’’
In plain English, what that means is
that because of the President’s leader-
ship and the recommendations of our
bipartisan leaders, we will avoid what
Secretary Mattis said has been so dam-
aging to our military.
Here is what happened. Back in 2011,
we passed the Budget Control Act to
try to limit this part of the budget.
That came after a special committee
was appointed, which everyone hoped
would deal with this part of the budg-
et—the problem part, the part that is
causing the deficit.
The Budget Control Act came up
with a formula that everybody thought
would work. They said: Well, if we put
in there that we will have dramatic re-
ductions in military spending, Con-
gress will never do that, so they will be
forced to finally do something we all
should have had the courage to do a
long time ago, and that is deal with en-
titlements.
What happened? We didn’t deal with
the red line, and we cut the military.
We cut the military badly over the last
10 years, and we are just now beginning
to catch up. Last year, Congress avoid-
ed sequestration and increased discre-
tionary spending for fiscal years 2018
and 2019.
Let me say it again, because I am
going to repeat it over and over and
over: We increased spending last year
at about the rate of inflation. That is
not the cause of the Federal deficit.
Reaching that agreement, though,
meant that for the first time in nearly
a decade the Department of Defense re-
ceived its budget on time, and it re-
ceived a record funding level for re-
search and development.
This new 2-year budget agreement
that the President has recommended
will rebuild our military by providing
$738 billion for defense discretionary
spending for 2020 and $740 billion for
2021.
It will also allow us to fulfill the
commitment we made as a part of the
New START Treaty in 2010 in Decem-
ber. I voted for that, and part of the
deal with President Obama was that if
we passed the treaty limiting nuclear
weapons, we would make sure that ours
worked. President Trump said the
other day that Russia has 1,111 nuclear
weapons, and they all work. We don’t
want them to use them, and the best
way to keep them from using them is
to make sure ours work.
We have reached a budget agreement
so that we can get to work on the ap-
propriations bills and hopefully get
many of them done before the end of
the fiscal year, which is the 30th of
September. That is important to the
military especially.
When I met with Secretary of the
Army Mark Esper, who was approved
by a big vote yesterday as Secretary of
Defense, we talked about what it
meant to have an appropriations bill
passed into law on time, instead of a
so-called continuing resolution, which
is just a lazy way to go. It just says to
spend next year what you spent last
year, which means we don’t spend for
the things we need to spend, and we
don’t stop spending on the things we
shouldn’t spend.
Here are some of the benefits of pass-
ing the appropriations bill on time,

which would mean October 1. It keeps
large projects on time and on budget.
That is true in the Defense Depart-
ment, and it is also true other places.
We have a big project called the Ura-
nium Processing Facility at Oak Ridge,
TN, which comes through the Energy
and Water Appropriations Committee,
which I chair, and Senator FEINSTEIN is
the ranking member. We made sure
that is on time and on budget—$6.5 bil-
lion by 2025. But if we don’t appro-
priate the money on time and on budg-
et, we can’t finish the project on time
and on budget, and who is hurt by
that? Our national defense and our tax-
payers or the Chickamauga Lock in
Tennessee.
All of the Army Corps of Engineers
leaders have told me: Don’t start these
projects and then stop them. Don’t stop
and start and stop and start. That
wastes money and slows things down.
So, for the last several years, we
have continued steady reconstruction.
We need to pass these on time and on
budget.
Also, it keeps equipment mainte-
nance at the Department of Defense on
schedule. That saves money. There is
more research and development for new
technologies. It speeds up moderniza-
tion of current equipment and keeps
military training on schedule. That
means soldiers, sailors, airmen, and
marines are properly prepared for
prompt combat, and it prevents acci-
dents.
This new 2-year agreement also helps
our veterans. In 2018, President Trump
signed the VA MISSION Act, which the
Senate passed by a vote of 92 to 5. The
MISSION Act gave veterans the ability
to seek medical care outside the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs and see a
private doctor closer to home. So if
you are 60 miles away in the State of
Nebraska or Kansas or Tennessee and
you need medical care and you can’t be
seen at a VA facility, you can see a pri-
vate doctor close to home. This budget
agreement makes sure we have enough
money to support that, and I will ask
the staff here how much that is.
Senator PERDUE said yesterday that
40 percent of the increase in the spend-
ing in this budget agreement, on the
discretionary side, is to help veterans
with the Choice Program. So it is not
even in the national defense part of the
budget; it is in the nondefense part of
the budget. It helps veterans. So 40 per-
cent of this increase is helping vet-
erans on top of what we spend for de-
fense, and we still keep the spending at
about the rate of inflation. That is not
the source of our budget deficit.
It is important for the American peo-
ple to know that the Republican major-
ity in Congress has worked together
with Democrats to provide record lev-
els of funding for science, research, and
technology. In the Senate, Senator
BLUNT from Missouri and Senator MUR-
RAY from Washington State have pro-
vided the leadership for that in the Ap-
propriations Committee.
In April 2016, Francis Collins, Direc-
tor of the National Institutes of
Health, told our Appropriations Com-
mittee—I am a member of that, as are
Senator DURBIN and others; we worked
on this together—that with adequate
and consistent funding, he can make 10
bold predictions about some of the
medical miracles he expects over the
next several years. He talked about re-
generative medicine that would replace
heart transplants by restoring your
heart from your own cells. He talked
about vaccines for Zika, for HIV/AIDS,
and for the universal flu, which kills
tens of thousands. He talked about an
artificial pancreas. He talked about
cures for Alzheimer’s or at least medi-
cines that would identify the symp-
toms—that would identify Alzheimer’s
before the symptoms and do something
about it.
Since fiscal year 2015, the Appropria-
tions Committee has increased funding
for the National Institutes of Health by
$9 billion, or 30 percent. From $30.3 bil-
lion in 2015 to $39.34 billion in fiscal
year 2019, Senator BLUNT and Senator
MURRAY did that by cutting some pro-
grams and increasing the National In-
stitutes of Health. They did it all down
here in the blue line that stays within
the rate of inflation—not up here in
the red line. That is called good gov-
ernment.
I can’t tell you the number of leaders
of academic and research institutions I
meet who say that the young inves-
tigators in our country are so encour-
aged by this new funding for bio-
medical research, and they are busy
working on the next miracles. That is
what consistent funding will do.
Dr. Collins came back to the com-
mittee this year, and I asked him if he
was ready to update those bold pre-
dictions. He said: We are close to a cure
for sickle cell anemia—sickle cell dis-
ease—and a new, nonaddictive pain-
killer which in my view would be the
holy grail in our fight against opioids.
With this new budget agreement, Con-
gress could increase funding for the Na-
tional Institutes of Health for the sixth
consecutive year to continue this life-
saving research and do it all within the
blue line, which is not the cause of the
Federal budget deficit.
Let’s go to the Office of Science. Last
year, the Energy and Water Develop-
ment Appropriations Subcommittee
that I chair with the Senator from
California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, the ranking
Democrat, agreed, along with Congress,
for the fourth consecutive year—and
President Trump signed it—to provide
record funding for the Department of
Energy’s Office of Science. With this
new budget, we can do it for 5 years.
What does this mean? This means fund-
ing for the 17 National Laboratories,
including the Oak Ridge National Lab-
oratory, which are America’s secret
weapon. No other country has anything
like our National Laboratories. Many
Americans worry about competition
from China and other parts of the
world. How do we meet that competi-
tion? Through innovation.
Where does that innovation come
from? It is hard to think of a major ini-
tiative that has not come since World
War II without some federally spon-
sored research funding. Funding our
Labs is important and helps keep us
first in the world in supercomputing.
Why is supercomputing important? Be-
cause it keeps our standard of living
high and keeps our national defense on
its toes.
China knows that. Two years ago,
China had the two top supercomputers,
but today the United States has the
two fastest supercomputers in the
world and the Exascale computing
project will deliver the next generation
system starting in 2021. This accom-
plishment is not the result of 1 year of
funding or one political party but 10
years of bipartisan effort through the
Bush, Obama, and Trump administra-
tions, Democratic and Republican, to
try to make sure America is first in
the world of supercomputing. We did it
all under the blue line over the last 10
years. The funding went up at the rate
of inflation, not through the Moon like
in entitlements which is the source of
the Federal budget deficit, not the
money we spend to keep ahead of China
and Japan in supercomputing.
On national parks, Ken Burns and
others say America’s national parks
are our best idea. There are 417 of
them. They have a badly deferred
maintenance backlog. Senators
PORTMAN, WARNER, KING, myself, and
others are working with President
Trump, who supports our legislation,
to try to cut half of the deferred main-
tenance in the national park backlogs
in the next 5 years. We are going to use
money from energy on Federal lands to
do that.
Americans are often shocked to find
when they go to Federal parks that
bathrooms don’t work, roofs leak, and
campgrounds are closed because there
is not enough money for maintenance.
This budget helps make sure our na-
tional parks are something Americans
can continue to enjoy—all 418 of those
parks—and we do that under the blue
line that goes up at the rate of infla-
tion, not at the budget-busting rate of
the entitlements line.
I have said this over and over, and it
needs to be said over and over. The red
line is mandatory spending. The blue
line is discretionary spending. The blue
line will be $1.6 trillion at the end of 10
more years. The red line will be $5.4
trillion at the end of 10 more years.
Ten years ago, the blue line was 1.1 and
the red line was 1.8. What do you think
the problem is for the source of the
Federal budget? You don’t need a Ph.D.
in mathematics to figure this out. It is
not this line. It is not national defense;
it is not biomedical research; it is not
supercomputing; it is not the Army
Corps of Engineers. It is this one line—
entitlements. It is our fault for not
having dealt with it, but we shouldn’t
beat our chest and pretend to balance
the budget by decimating the work on
that blue line. Discretionary spending
is only 31 percent of the money. Man-
datory spending is the rest of the fund-
ing. It will increase from 69 percent of

total spending to 78 percent in 2029.
The spending on national parks, na-
tional defense, National Institutes of
Health, and National Labs will be re-
duced to 22 percent. I don’t believe we
can properly defend our country, prop-
erly keep up our parks, stay first in the
world in supercomputing, and expect to
continue biomedical research that pro-
duces lifesaving miracles if we squeeze
all the money out of the blue line and
let it go up in the air on the red line.
The United States is experiencing ro-
bust economic growth, and there is a
lot of political talk in this Chamber
but no one really disputes that. Our
economy is growing and growing. We
have not seen anything like it in a long
time. There have been 6 million new
jobs created just since President
Trump was elected, with the lowest un-
employment rate in 50 years, at 3.7 per-
cent.
Before Congress passed the major tax
reform in 31 years, our gross domestic
product was projected to be a little less
than 2 percent over the next 10 years.
For the first quarter of 2019 this year,
actual gross domestic product was a
little over 3 percent. Higher GDP and
lower unemployment leads to higher
family incomes and more revenue for
the Federal Government. More revenue
for the Federal Government reduces
the debt.
I urge my colleagues to support this
2-year budget agreement. To those who
are worried about the Federal debt, I
am worried about it too. That is why
Senator Corker and I put our bill in to
reduce by a growth of $1 trillion over 10
years what is happening with this red
line. If we want to talk about the Fed-
eral budget deficit, let’s talk about
where it really is. Let’s talk about the
red line, which has gone from $1.8 tril-
lion 10 years ago and is projected by
the Congressional Budget Office to go
to $5.4 trillion 10 years from now.
Let’s not pretend we are balancing
the Federal budget by focusing on the
part of the Federal budget that is
under control, the part that funds our
military, national parks, biomedical
research, and National Labs. For the
last 10 years, it has gone up at about
the rate of inflation, and for the next
10 years, according to the Congres-
sional Budget Office—including this 2-
year budget agreement which only af-
fects the blue line, not the red line—it
goes up at the rate of inflation. So I am
proud to support it. I believe it is the
right thing to do, and when the House
sends us a chance to vote for it next
week, I hope it gets a big vote from the
U.S. Senate.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma.
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let
me just take a few minutes here to
share an idea that when we come back
next week, we will be talking about the
budget. We are going to be talking
about making really difficult, very dif-
ficult decisions.
I would state that we on the Senate
Armed Services Committee have an ad-
vantage over some of the other people
because one of the critical areas in the
budget coming up is how we treat the
military. I think it is important for
people to understand that if you are a
member of the Armed Services Com-
mittee, you are in a position to know
something the other Members don’t
know. It may sound like someone is
not doing their job, but that is not true
at all.
When you are on the Senate Armed
Services Committee, there are hearings
that take place. Starting in January,
there are posture hearings. Posture
hearings normally take about 6 hours a
week. In posture hearings, we find out
about matters that others just don’t
have time to find out about unless you
are a member of the committee. If you
are a member, you are sitting there for
3 hours a week.
I don’t say this critically of the pre-
vious administration because—I would
say, in the Obama administration, the
top priority was not defending Amer-
ica. In fact, he established something
called parity. Parity meant that for
every one dollar put into the military
budget, we have to put one dollar into
the nonmilitary budget. That had
never happened before, at least it had
not happened since World War II. At
that time, it was established that na-
tional defense would be our priority.
Every Democrat and every Republican
President at that time all the way up
until the Obama administration had
defending America as the top priority.
What happened during that adminis-
tration was that we actually had a dra-
matic reduction. If you use constant
dollars, that reduction took place be-
tween 2010 and 2015, using constant dol-
lars. For this description, we used 2018
dollars. Going into 2010, it was about
$794 billion. Going into 2015, it was $586
billion or something like that. So there
was about a 25-percent reduction in the
defense budget in a 5-year period. That
had never happened before in the his-
tory of this country. Yet we suffered
through, and we paid dearly for it.
A lot of people are not aware of it,
unless you are on the Armed Services
Committee because we see it. When the
current President came in, President
Trump, his budget boosted that back
up. Now we are talking about real dol-
lars, and it was $700 billion in fiscal
year 2018. Then for fiscal year 2019 it
was $716 billion.
Now we are getting into where we are
today in the current budget. We passed
a defense authorization bill, and in it
we actually came out agreeing that we
had to get to $750 billion. Someone
might ask why. We had something
called the National Defense Commis-
sion report. It was a document that
was a good document that talked about
how we were going to need to appro-
priate because during the Obama ad-
ministration we saw China and Russia
become peer competitors in many
areas. In fact, they ended up with some
things better than ours. Let me give an
example. Artillery during that period
of time for both China and Russia had
us outranged and outgunned. How
many people know that? People assume
America has the best of everything.
Well, that was true up until this time.
Air and defense, there were only two
Active-Duty battalions with no new
technological advancements. Nothing
happened during that time. That al-
lowed China and Russia to start creep-
ing up and getting ahead of us.
On nuclear triad modernization, we
had no modernization increases at that
time, but Russia and China did. In fact,
China actually has today a nuclear
triad, and Russia is actually building
one. The U.S. defense against elec-
tronic warfare—we didn’t have that
kind of a defense. With Russia, you can
remember what happened in Ukraine.
Hypersonic weapons is the newest
thing that people talk about. It is a
type of weapon system that moves five
times the speed of sound. It is the
weapon system of the future. Prior to
the past administration, prior to the
Obama administration, we were ahead
in our research on hypersonic weapons,
but by the end of that time and up
until this new administration came in,
we were actually behind Russia and
China. I only say that because we real-
ly took a hit.
The only time—we have had three op-
portunities, one in fiscal year 2018, one
in fiscal year 2019, and then another on
the budget we are going to be voting on
this coming week. That was our oppor-
tunity to catch up.
I would just say this: If you are on
the Armed Services Committee, you
have an obligation because you are in a
unique position of knowing the effi-
ciencies that we have. Others don’t
have that. Many of the Members take
the time and they find out that they
can get this done.
But we are in a position where—Gen-
eral Dunford, as an example, said that
we have lost our qualitative and our
quantitative edge in artillery. We are
actually outnumbered 5 to 1 by China
and 10 to 1 by Russia. In air and missile
defense, China and Russia have weap-
ons that prevent access—we call them
SAMs, surface-to-air missiles. Nuclear
modernization—no real U.S. mod-
ernization took place during that time.
We had some of our top people admit-
ting that we had deficiencies, and we
quickly tried to correct them.
Along came fiscal year 2018. In fiscal
year 2018, we got back up to a $700 bil-
lion budget, and we started working on
things. We had the manual. It is a man-
ual I normally bring down with me to
the floor when we talk about this be-
cause this is something that everyone
agreed on as the manual was put to-
gether. It was the NDS Commission re-
port. It was put together by 6 Demo-
crats and 6 Republicans—all experts in
national defense—and everyone agreed
that would be our blueprint to pull us
out of where we were at that time, and
it was working. We were on schedule to
do it. We are currently on schedule
with this budget.

July 25, 2019
It says that while we are rebuilding
our military, we should be anticipating
that we have to increase our military
spending by between 3 percent and 5
percent over this period of time. That
is a net increase. Well, the budget we
came out with in the defense author-
ization bill was $750 billion, and it was
a budget that almost gets us there but
not quite.
The President’s budget agreement
that came out the other day has a fig-
ure of $738 billion. That is very close to
where we are supposed to be. It is a 2-
year budget, and that is a good thing
for the military. Those of us on the De-
fense Committee understand that. So
that brings that $738 up to $740.5 billion
for 2021, so it is very close to the $750
billion defense authorization.
I only say that because that makes it
more important for anyone who is serv-
ing on the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee to be in a position to know
what I just said. And that is something
that most people don’t know, and I
don’t believe that most of the Members
of this body know, but those who are
on the committee do know it. We have
to keep in mind that this budget is
going to be the only way that we are
going to be able to do what needs to be
done.
This is the short version. I will come
back and talk more this coming Mon-
day and give a lot more details than I
gave now. I will say this: I would en-
courage any member of the Senate
Armed Services Committee to under-
stand that they are in a position to
know what the problem is, and a lot of
other people do not know this. I would
anticipate that members of the com-
mittee would be in that unique posi-
tion to know and would be supporting a
budget that gives us enough room to
get back into position to recover from
the losses that we took from the pre-
vious administration. That is what is
at stake. That is what we are antici-
pating. I would anticipate that our
members from the committee should
be doing that.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
YOUNT). The Senator from Ohio.
OPIOID EPIDEMIC
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am
on the floor this afternoon to talk
about an issue that I have come to this
floor other times to speak about, and
that is the drug crisis we face in this
country. In fact, I am told that over
the last 3 years, I have now come to
the floor 58 times to address this
topic—to talk about the opioid crisis,
talk about the new resurgence of crys-
tal meth, and talk about what we can
do about it.
I will tell you, during those 3 years,
we made a lot of progress, not just in
talking about this issue but doing
something about it. We put new poli-
cies in place at the Federal level for
better prevention, better treatment,
better longer term recovery, and to
also help our first responders—specifi-
cally, to give them access to this mir-
acle drug naloxone, which reverses the
effect of overdose.
Congress passed legislation, like the
Comprehensive Addiction and Recov-
ery Act, the Cures legislation, and the
STOP Act. We have provided actually
more than $4 billion of additional fund-
ing for these programs—particularly
for treatment—over just the last few
years. In Ohio alone, we have received
$140 million through CARA and Cures
since they were signed into law. That
money has gone toward innovative,
evidence-based programs that are actu-
ally making a difference. We had to do
this because this crisis has gripped our
country in the worst drug epidemic
ever. More people are now dying every
year from overdoses from these drugs
than died in the entire Vietnam con-
flict, as an example. We have never
seen anything quite this bad, so we re-
sponded, as we should have, at the na-
tional level to a national crisis.
Working with States, localities, non-
profits, people out there in the trench-
es doing the hard work, we are begin-
ning to make a difference. Last week,
the Centers for Disease Control—CDC—
issued a report with their latest statis-
tics on overdose deaths. While drug
overdose deaths are still way too high,
they show we are actually seeing a re-
duction.
By the way, this is the first time we
have seen a reduction in opioid over-
dose deaths in more than 8 years.
Think about that. Every year for 8
years, we have seen increases in
deaths, to the point that we had over
70,000 people a year dying of overdoses
in 2017. In 2018—we now have the num-
bers in from CDC—it went from rough-
ly 71,000 to roughly 68,000. Again, that
is way too high. No one should be satis-
fied with that. But after increases
every year, to have a 4-percent de-
crease nationally shows that we are be-
ginning to turn the tide. Let’s keep
doing what we are doing. We cannot
pull back now. If we do, it will just go
back up again. Actually, it is the first
time since 1990, I am told, that nation-
wide overdoses from any kind of
drugs—opioids and other things—have
decreased in a calendar year. That is
the first time since 1990.
In Ohio, we did even better from 2017
to 2018. We had more than a 4-percent
drop; we actually had a 22-percent drop
in Ohio. That is partly because my
home State has been ground zero for
this. Like West Virginia, Kentucky,
and other States, we have been hit
really hard. To go 22 percent below
where we were the previous year is
progress, and we should be proud of
that. Still, we are seeing overdose rates
that are way too high. Overall, around
the country, 33 States had reductions.
As I said earlier, the area where we
made the most progress is in com-
bating opioids, partly because of legis-
lation we passed here. Particularly, we
tried to address this issue of prescrip-
tion drugs, heroin, and fentanyl.
The Washington Post recently pub-
lished a stunning analysis showing why
it is so important that we continue to
push back and how we got here. They
showed that for the 6 years between
2006 and 2012, there was an absolutely
unbelievably high number of shipments
of prescription pain medications.
Oxycodone and hydrocodone were the
ones they focused on, which account
for three-quarters of the total opioid
pill shipments to pharmacies.
In a single CVS pharmacy right out-
side of Cleveland, OH, more than 6.4
million pills were delivered during that
6-year period. Think about that. In one
small pharmacy, there were over 6 mil-
lion pills. Overall, the Post found that
over that period, more than 3.6 billion
prescription pain pills were supplied to
Ohio. That is ‘‘billion’’ with a ‘‘b.’’
That is an astounding number. That
means that during those 6 years, there
were approximately 313 opioid prescrip-
tion pain pills prescribed for every sin-
gle man, woman, and child in Ohio.
That is what we are talking about
here.
Obviously, this was used as a way for
people to take these pills and spread
them, not just in Ohio but in other
places, causing immense harm because
people got addicted to these pills and
turned to heroin and fentanyl. Many of
these people are people who not just
have an addiction but end up having
overdoses, and many of them died.
This week, the largest civil trial in
U.S. history will begin in my home
State of Ohio. I think it is appropriate
that it is in Ohio. This will consolidate
cases from around the country. More
than 2,000 cities, counties, Native
American Tribes, and others will sue
some of the biggest pharmaceutical
companies and major distributors for
their role in this drug crisis. The phar-
maceutical companies and the distribu-
tors are going to be sued in court in
Ohio through a consolidated case. This
is the biggest civil trial, they say, in
the history of our country.
Two of the Ohio plaintiff counties—
Cuyahoga and Summit—have been
among the areas in my State that were
hardest hit by opioids. No wonder they
are part of this lawsuit. In 2016, the
death rate from pharmaceuticals—
opioids, painkillers—in Cuyahoga
County was 3.26 times the national av-
erage. In Summit County, so many
people died from overdoses that a mo-
bile morgue had to be created in order
to help process the bodies. I was there
in Summit County during that time pe-
riod. They actually had to bring in a
mobile unit to be able to deal with all
the overdose deaths.
The more we find out about the sheer
number of pills these drug companies
pumped into the United States—more
than 76 billion overall during that pe-
riod—the more it is clear that lawsuits
like this are going to be necessary to
get to the bottom of what happened
and require these entities to help those
who were affected by these pain pills. A
lot of these people turned to other sub-
stances that were more accessible and
less expensive, like heroin, but had

started with an addiction to pain medi-
cation. We are pushing back against
the opioid pill industry that flourished
for too long within our borders. That is
a positive sign.
While the CDC showed an overall de-
crease in overdose deaths, as I talked
about earlier, there are some troubling
trends that have continued.
First, while the number of opioid
overdose deaths fell, the number of
overdose deaths fell related to syn-
thetic opioids—specifically, cheap and
dangerous fentanyl—actually rose.
Heroin and prescription drugs went
down, but actually, for the synthetic
opioid—which is 50 times more power-
ful than heroin and unfortunately pro-
duced overseas and shipped into our
country—those numbers actually rose.
Fentanyl deaths actually rose. In fact,
last year, more deaths were attributed
to fentanyl than to heroin and pre-
scription drugs combined.
Fentanyl is the big new danger.
There is overall progress, but fentanyl
is getting worse. We had a report last
week of a single kilo of fentanyl being
seized in Middletown, OH, which is
enough of the drug to kill more than
half a million people. This was in our
community, Middletown, OH. That is
enough of the drug to kill more than
half a million people.
We are beginning to push back on
fentanyl, as some of you know, through
legislation, including the STOP Act,
which got passed in this Chamber and
in the House. This is doing a better job
with keeping this poison from coming
through our U.S. mail system, which is
where most of it has been coming from.
Our own postal system has been the
conduit for this poison. Most of it is
coming from one country—China. It is
produced in chemical labs there by un-
scrupulous scientists and chemists and
then sent through the mail.
The 2019 audit by the inspector gen-
eral of the Postal Service found that
the Postal Service identified and pulled
a package requested by Customs and
Border Protection 88 percent of the
time. This was an improvement from
only 79 percent of the time the year be-
fore, in 2017, and only 67 percent of the
time in 2016, but it is still not com-
plying with the STOP Act. The STOP
Act says 100 percent, not 88 percent.
Again, why is that important?
This stuff is getting in through the
mail. If the U.S. Customs and Border
Protection can identify these packages
and screen them and pull them offline,
less of that poison will come into our
neighborhoods. It also raises the price
of this product, which is part of the
problem right now—that it is not just
powerful and deadly but also inexpen-
sive.
Overall, it was said that the Postal
Service missed a number of packages—
12 percent—due to operational errors.
We can’t afford these operational er-
rors. It is too important.
We need to ensure that all packages
that enter the United States have the
kind of information we need to be able
to track potentially harmful packages
once they get inside our border. This is
advance electronic data. It is not re-
quired everywhere, but it needs to be.
The STOP Act requires the Postal
Service to do that, including with 100
percent of the packages coming in from
China. It required it, by the way, by
December 31 of last year. Yet the Post-
al Service just informed us on the Per-
manent Subcommittee on Investiga-
tions, on which we did this work—
where we investigated this over many,
many months—that it has only re-
ceived data on 52.8 percent of all of our
international packages and only 70.7
percent on those from China for 2018. In
March of this year, 2019, it was up to 57
percent and 78 percent. Let’s get to 100
percent from China. This legislation
requires 70 percent from other coun-
tries. There is no excuse for not meet-
ing this. Again, it is the law of the
land. So, while it is improving, the
process is taking too long, and it has
failed to meet the requirements in the
STOP Act.
The next big milestone, by the way,
in the implementation of the law re-
quires the Postal Service to begin re-
fusing foreign shipments without there
being the required advance electronic
data that reads where it is from, what
is in it, and where it is going. This is to
apply to any package to be received
after December 31, 2020. At the end of
next year, if it is not providing the
data, we will refuse the package.
A lot of people have expressed con-
cern about that to me. ‘‘My gosh. This
is going to stop international freight
back and forth.’’ No. It is going to re-
quire the Postal Service to do what it
should be doing already, which is to re-
quire these shippers to do what they
should be doing, and that is to provide
the data. It is not hard, and it is not
expensive. Again, most people are
doing it. By the way, FedEx, DHL, and
UPS—the private carriers—have done
it for years. They have done it based on
the law that passed after the 9/11 at-
tacks. It is our post office that has not.
Sometimes it has viewed this, appar-
ently, as its having a competitive ad-
vantage in its not having to require
that. Do you know what? It is too im-
portant to us and to the deaths that
are occurring from fentanyl not to re-
quire that.
We have to improve the screening in
the mail, and we are, and we will con-
tinue to make progress on that. Of
course, that is not all we have to do.
More fentanyl is now coming from
other places, particularly from across
our southern border. This is very con-
cerning because we have gaps on our
southern border right now. They say
that between 40 and 60 percent of the
Border Patrol agents are being pulled
off the border to deal with the very
real humanitarian crisis on the border.
I was there a week ago last Friday,
and I had an opportunity to speak to a
number of Border Patrol agents who
were processing individuals and dealing
with the humanitarian needs of a surge
of families and children, including
those who were claiming asylum. We
need to have these people attending to
the humanitarian needs and processing
these individuals. Yet I will tell you,
when I talked to the Border Patrol
agents about it, that was not where
they wanted to be. They want to be
doing their jobs because they know
these drugs are coming in when they
are not out there with a watchful eye
on our border.
Unfortunately, we are in a situation
right now where we need more humani-
tarian aid, which we have finally pro-
vided, thank goodness. We also need
more help on the border itself to be
able to close some of these gaps. I want
to be sure that we are, indeed, dealing
with both issues. We can and should.
The drug smugglers who are affili-
ated with Mexican cartels are pretty
smart. They know where there are
gaps. They take advantage of them and
bring in more fentanyl. Last year, Cus-
toms and Border Protection seized
about 1,800 pounds of fentanyl at the
border. In the first half of this year
alone, it seized more than 2,000 pounds
of fentanyl. This year, we are headed
toward apprehending double the
fentanyl at the border. I will tell you
we don’t know how much is coming in.
Nobody does.
Because of these gaps and because of
the Border Patrol’s having been pulled
off the border to deal with the very
real crisis down there with regard to
the humanitarian issue and the flux of
people coming in, there are more gaps.
The numbers of those shipments that
have been apprehended have been bad
enough—more than double this year. It
has been enough fentanyl to kill mil-
lions of people, and it is probably worse
than that.
This fentanyl is increasingly being
laced into other drugs by the cartels.
The fentanyl makes you so likely to
become addicted that they put it in
other things, including crystal meth,
including cocaine, including heroin. In-
dividuals who consume anything right
now that is a street drug might be un-
knowingly ingesting this incredibly
toxic drug fentanyl also and risking
their lives because of the overdose
deaths that are associated with it.
In Ohio, the number of overdose
deaths attributed to fentanyl-laced co-
caine and methamphetamines has in-
creased dramatically. As an example,
Columbus Public Health actually re-
leased a public alert just this week
that urged anyone who uses drugs or
knows someone who uses drugs to have
naloxone, a miracle drug—some people
call it Narcan—that reverses the ef-
fects of the overdose from opioids.
They say you have to have this miracle
drug on hand because of the fentanyl
poisoning that is going on in Colum-
bus. Already in 2019, 740 doses of
Narcan have been issued in response to
overdoses in one town alone, Toledo,
OH.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5091
July 25, 2019
This issue of fentanyl is very real. It
is affecting our communities in new
ways, and we have to be able to re-
spond flexibly to what is happening. It
remains a dangerous threat.
Also complicating the recovery proc-
ess is the continued resurgence of
psychostimulants, particularly crystal
meth. Again, crystal meth is coming
from—where?—across the border, from
Mexico. You will probably remember
that at one time in your communities,
there was talk about meth labs. You
may have seen some coverage of that,
and you may have had some meth labs
in your neighborhood. There are hor-
rible environmental issues, obviously,
in the producing of
methamphetamines, which are so dan-
gerous. Guess what. There are no more
meth labs in your neighborhood. That
is the good news. The bad news is,
there are no meth labs because this
stuff that comes in from Mexico is
cheaper and more powerful, more dev-
astating, and more damaging to our
communities. So it is a concern.
The latest CDC data on overdose
deaths—particularly with regard to
opioids—is very hopeful, but the over-
dose deaths by psychostimulants and
cocaine continue to increase. That is
because, again, fentanyl is being mixed
into these psychostimulants. Meth-
amphetamine deaths increased by near-
ly 30 percent, and 42 percent of all over-
dose deaths last year were directly at-
tributable to cocaine,
psychostimulants like meth, or both
mixed together. That is the new prob-
lem, and we have to address it.
As we have continued to fight opioid
abuse, I recently introduced a bill, en-
titled ‘‘Combating Meth and Cocaine
Act,’’ in order to address this resur-
gence and to be sure that here in Con-
gress we are being flexible in respond-
ing to it and not waiting until we have
another huge drug crisis here of a new
way to mix drugs or a new resurgence
of crystal meth. To date, grants pro-
vided by the 21st Century Cures Act,
which is now called the State opioid re-
sponse grants, have been used to in-
crease access to naloxone—again, a
very important drug—as well as to
long-term addiction treatment and
support services. Yet, for all the good
these grants have done, they can’t be
used to address the crisis beyond
opioids, which ignores the underground
reality, at least in my State and in so
many other States.
Earlier this year, for example, I par-
ticipated in a roundtable discussion
with leaders in Knox County, and I do
this around the State on a regular
basis. In Knox County, the prosecutor’s
office estimated that 80 to 90 percent of
all drug incidents now involve crystal
meth—methamphetamines. They told
me they have been able to use the
State opioid response grants to help
with the treatment and recovery serv-
ices but that they are not effective
with regard to meth because there is
not an effective way to treat meth with
drugs, as there is with opioids. There is
not an effective way to use the Narcan
with meth, as there is with opioids. So
we need to be more flexible in pro-
viding these communities with the help
they need to combat this new resur-
gence. Our legislation will allow the
State opioid response grants to be used
for programs that focus on
methamphetamines and on cocaine
usage. More flexibility is important.
We know these funds are making a
difference, so the bill will also reau-
thorize the State opioid response
grants for 5 years, which will give some
certainty by providing the $500 million
annually that will be needed to ensure
there will be a stable funding stream to
go to these innovative programs in the
States. This is a simple, commonsense
change. It will allow State and local
organizations the flexibility they need
to fight what is quickly becoming a
two-front war on addiction—opioids
but also psychostimulants that are
coming back with a vengeance.
The latest data from the CDC is a
promising sign that we can and will re-
cover from the drug crisis if we con-
tinue to work to give those in need the
help they need to get back on their
feet. We also need to ensure that we
don’t rest on our laurels as cartels con-
tinue to innovate themselves and try
different angles.
There is so much money in this that
these deadly drugs will continue to
come unless we show the same kind of
flexibility when responding. If they
can, they are going to continue to send
drugs through the postal system. They
are going to continue to send them
across the southern border. Fentanyl,
cocaine, and meth have shown them-
selves to be continuing public health
threats, and we have to keep working—
all of us here on a bipartisan basis—to
ensure that State and local govern-
ments get the resources they need to
help stem the tide.
The Federal Government has been a
better partner over the past few years
with our States, with our localities,
and with our nonprofits that are there
in the trenches, doing the hard work.
We can’t give up now. The numbers
from the CDC are hopeful with regard
to opioids, but that just means we need
to redouble our efforts to ensure that
we do not now back off. We cannot
take our eye off the ball. We have to
continue to focus on what we are doing
and then add to that more flexible re-
sponses to the new resurgence of
fentanyl being mixed with meth and
crystal meth coming in directly from
Mexico. This new drug reality is one
that must be met with the same kind
of innovative response we have re-
sponded with here in the last few years.

Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise
after 10 years of being in the Senate
and after having endured speech after
speech after speech on this floor that
has claimed the Republican Party is
the party of fiscal discipline. It was
politics that created something during
the depths of the worst recession,
called the tea party, which rallied all
over America to stop what it said was
runaway spending.
When I arrived here, I actually be-
lieved that the Republican Party was a
fiscally responsible party, that there
was some principle behind it. I know
better today. I was naive. It is all
about politics.
There have been five budget deals
since 2013 between Majority Leader
MITCH MCCONNELL and whoever has
happened to be in the White House.
These deals were meant to overcome
the idiocy of the across-the-board cuts
that were created by the sequestra-
tion—which nobody in America under-
stands but which are basically across-
the-board cuts on spending—that oth-
erwise would have been investments in
your family, maybe, or investments in
our military. They were agreed to as
part of a fiscal cliff deal in the dark of
night, at 2 o’clock in the morning, by
nobody—literally nobody—who had ac-
tually read the bill. Ever since then,
politicians in Washington have been
making deals to try to overcome it.
When President Obama was Presi-
dent, this is how much money he was
allowed to spend. Since Donald Trump
has been President, this is the money
that the Republicans have spent. This
red is defense, and the blue is non-
defense.
Under President Obama the deals in-
creased by an average of $33 billion
above the sequester. The two deals
under Donald Trump increased spend-
ing by $154 billion, four times as
much—four times as much—at a mo-
ment when the President is saying our
economy is the best it has ever been in
American history.
The result of this is that under Don-
ald Trump the deficit has increased by
15 percent each year. The deficit just
between last year and this year is up
by 23 percent as a result of the Repub-
lican majority in the Senate and Don-
ald Trump.
We are on track to run $1 trillion
deficits every year as far as the eye can
see. That is after 10 years of economic
growth and unemployment below 4 per-
cent.
At no time in our history have defi-
cits been this large outside of a major
war or a recession, which brings me to
my second slide.
This is the annual spending growth
around here. This is the annual spend-
ing growth around here of defense and
nondefense. They are both in here.
Under President Obama, in his first
term, the spending went up by 3 per-
cent. We were in the worst recession
since the Great Depression. He had to
pass the Recovery Act. That is in this
number. That is in this number. It was
at the depths of the worst recession
since the Great Depression. Three mil-
lion Americans lost their homes, and 9
million Americans lost their jobs. We
had a 10-percent unemployment rate—

not a 4-percent rate, not a 3 and
change, but a 10-percent rate. In the
name of fiscal responsibility, Repub-
licans did nothing except berate the
President for trying to save the econ-
omy and for what he was trying to do.
I will come to that in a moment.
This includes the Recovery Act.
Overall growth—annual spending
growth—grew by 3 percent during
President Obama’s first term. It fell by
2 percent during President Obama’s
second term.
It has gone up by 4 percent during
Trump’s first term. It has increased
more under this Republican President.
Admittedly, he is not a conservative. It
has grown more under this Republican
President than it did when President
Obama was trying to save the economy
during the worst recession since the
Great Depression. This 3 percent num-
ber includes the Recovery Act. The Re-
publicans are now growing government
spending by more than that—by more
than that.
Here is what they said when they
wouldn’t lift a finger during the depths
of the worst recession. Congressman
MIKE PENCE, before he was Vice Presi-
dent, said:
We the people do not consent to runaway
Federal spending. We the people do not con-
sent to the notion that we can borrow and
spend and bail our way back to a growing
America.
He said that to a tea party rally here
in Washington, DC, that was here to
stop runaway spending.
Where are they today? It is worse
today than it ever was under President
Obama. It is far worse, not a little bit
worse, because not included on this
slide are the tax cuts that have never
paid for themselves and are not paying
for themselves here.
Donald Trump and the Republicans
have created $2 trillion of deficit
spending because of the tax cuts and $2
trillion of deficit spending because of
the spending.
By the way, they are not actually
spending this money, in a sense. They
are borrowing all of it from our chil-
dren. They have not paid for a dollar of
it—not one dollar. They are borrowing
it from the pages who are here. They
are borrowing it from the children of
cops, teachers, and firefighters—that is
who they are borrowing it from—to
give tax cuts to rich people, to make
our economic inequality greater.
Congressman Mick Mulvaney, now
the President’s Chief of Staff, talking
about the Obama administration’s
budget at the time, said:
It’s hard to explain how detached from re-
ality that is, to think that the country can
spend another $1.6 trillion when it doesn’t
have the means. It means either you haven’t
been paying attention or you don’t care.
He is the President’s Chief of Staff.
He is the President’s Budget Director.
If that was runaway spending, how is
this not runaway spending?
The junior Senator from Texas said:
The debt is out of control. And, it is jeop-
ardizing the future for our kids. I have got
two little kids who are 4 and 2.
He lectured the President.
And, the idea of handing them a $16 trillion
debt, I think is immoral.
Really? What about $24 trillion?
What about $30 trillion? Is that more
moral than $16 trillion? Really?
Now, former Speaker Paul Ryan said:
‘‘We will end up with a Greece-like sit-
uation on our hands.’’
‘‘A debt crisis is coming to the coun-
try.’’
That is what he said here.
Admittedly, he left in the middle of a
government shutdown, never to come
back to Washington, DC—a fitting end
to a decade of fiscal fights and shut-
downs and government closures, all
done in the name of fiscal responsi-
bility, never actually achieving it
and—never, ever actually achieving
it—only for the opportunity to spend
like this.
I can’t tell you the number of times
I have heard about this on this floor:
The debt and the deficit are just getting
out of control, and the administration is still
pumping through billions and trillions of
new spending.
Paul Ryan said:
Our debt is out of control. What was a fis-
cal challenge is now a fiscal crisis. We can-
not deny it; instead we must, as Americans
confront it responsibly. And that is exactly
what the Republicans pledged to do.
That is exactly what the Republicans
pledged to do. They immobilized our
government. They shut it down over
and over and over in the name of fiscal
responsibility—no help to the economy
or the next generation. That is the far-
thest thought from their mind.
After years of obstruction in the
name of fiscal responsibility, they
nominated Donald Trump, who prom-
ised during the campaign to deliver a
giant, beautiful, massive tax cut and
borrowed all of the money for it from
working people in this country.
There was a mayor in Indiana who
wrote a piece about that in the paper
that I thought was so instructive.
He said: That tax plan would be tan-
tamount to my going to my city coun-
cil and saying that I want to go borrow
more money than we have ever bor-
rowed before in the history of our
town, and I am not going to use it to
invest in roads or bridges or the sewers
or anything else, and I am just going to
take the money we borrowed that our
kids are going to have to give back,
and I am going to give it to the richest
neighborhood in my town.
He said they would have asked: What
have you been smoking?
He promised to pass ‘‘one of the larg-
est increases in national defense spend-
ing in American history’’ and ‘‘not
touch Social Security, Medicare, and
Medicaid.’’
He said he would eliminate not only
the deficit. This is Donald Trump, the
candidate whom the Republicans voted
for, whom FOX News, which is in the-
ory the conservative channel, has sup-
ported like an organ of the State, with
hosts who claim they are fiscally re-
sponsible. But he promised to elimi-
nate not only the deficit but the entire
national debt—that immoral debt of
$16 trillion that is now climbing to $30
trillion.
And the way he was going to do that
was by ‘‘vigorously eliminating waste,
fraud, and abuse in the federal govern-
ment, ending redundant government
programs, and growing the economy,’’
as well as by ‘‘renegotiating all of our
[debt] deals.’’
He hasn’t renegotiated one. He spent
more time failing to get a deal with the
leader of North Korea than trying to
address this challenge.
Donald Trump said:
It can be done. . . . it will take place and
it will go relatively quickly. If you have the
right people, like in the agencies and the
various people that do the balancing . . . you
can cut the numbers by two pennies and
three pennies and balance a budget quickly
and have a stronger and better country.
This is the President of the United
States of America.
That is ridiculous. That is ridiculous,
but it is no more ridiculous than the
history of the Republican Party, the
supposedly fiscally conservative
party—what a joke.
Going back to 2001, the last time we
had a surplus in America, Bill Clinton
was President. He was a Democrat. He
had a $5 trillion projected surplus over
the decade—unimaginable today. It is
unimaginable today, but politicians
like us were having discussions about
what to do with the surplus, what to do
with abundance, how to make Social
Security solvent, how to give the mid-
dle class a real tax cut, not a fake tax
cut that is masquerading and covering
up the tax cut for rich people.
But we did none of that, and, instead,
George Bush, who followed Bill Clin-
ton, cut taxes in 2001. Almost all of the
benefit went to wealthy people. He cut
taxes in 2003, and both times it was just
like Donald Trump said and the Major-
ity Leader MITCH MCCONNELL said both
times. They said: Oh, don’t worry
about it. They will pay for themselves.
A lie, a lie, and the number is in the
math. It is not about philosophy. This
isn’t about ideology. This is about the
math, and everybody in America could
see it because that is what produced
the $16 trillion that Paul Ryan said was
so immoral, $8 trillion ago and on the
way to $30 trillion in debt.
By the way, it is important to know
that when this Congress voted for
those tax cuts in 2003 that were not
paid for, the money was all borrowed
by the sons and daughters of working
people in America. We had troops in
Iraq and Afghanistan. So we didn’t
even have the decency while we had
people at war to pay for those wars or
to say to the American people: We need
to pay for those wars. No, we are not
going to pay for those wars, and we are
going to borrow the money from Amer-
ica to give tax cuts to rich people.
Then, President Bush, on top of that,
seeking reelection, passed Medicare
Part D, the drug program for seniors,
and paid for none of that either. All

that money is from our children—all of
it—and there has never been an effort
to pay for it since.
Then, because of their lax regulatory
oversight of the housing market, the
economy collapsed. The economy col-
lapsed, and Barack Obama was handed
not a $5 trillion surplus but a $1.2 tril-
lion deficit from the Republicans, from
George Bush. During the course of his
Presidency, we had to weather the
worst recession since the Great Depres-
sion. The worst it ever got around here
was $1.5 trillion on the deficit, and the
other side called him a Bolshevik and a
Socialist. Well-meaning people from all
over Wall Street and other places came
down here and said: Fix the debt. Fix
the debt.
Where are they today? Where are
they today?
By the time he left, President Obama
had cut the deficit by more than half—
by more than half.
Every one of these deals has been cut
by MITCH MCCONNELL, every single one.
So it didn’t surprise me at all this
week that he was reported in the Wash-
ington Post to have said to the Presi-
dent that no politician has ever lost an
election spending more money. No poli-
tician has ever lost an election spend-
ing more money, said the Republican
majority leader to the President. I
can’t think of a more Bolshevik state-
ment than that, to use terms that the
other side has been using for 10 years.
I can’t think of a more irresponsible
position than that when we are not in
the depths of a recession, when 10 mil-
lion people haven’t lost their jobs,
when the economy, according to the
President, is the best economy we have
ever had.
This is the moment we should be se-
curing our future. This is the moment
we should be preparing for another for-
eign engagement. Because of these
deals that have been led by MITCH
MCCONNELL, the Republican leader
from Kentucky, when you add it all up,
not only do we have this extraordinary
deficit that we have never seen in the
country’s history—

sent for 1 additional minute.

Mr. BENNET. But since 2001, we have
cut taxes by $5 trillion. We borrowed
all of that money from our children,
and almost all of the benefit went to
the wealthiest people in America. We
spent $5.6 trillion on wars in the Middle
East. We didn’t pay for a single dollar
of it. That is $11 trillion, $12 trillion
that we could have spent to fix every
road and bridge in America, that could
have fixed every single airport in
America that needs it, that could have
made Social Security solvent for my
children’s generation and for the other
children of the people who came out
here and said: We are here to immo-
bilize the Democratic President in the
name of fiscal responsibility. But now
we know the level of their fiscal hypoc-
risy. It knows no end.

JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, yester-
day we confirmed two more excellent
judges in the Senate. Despite Demo-
cratic obstruction, we continue to
move forward on confirming nominees
to the Federal bench.
Some of our Democratic colleagues
have criticized the amount of time the
Senate spends on judges. We have spent
a substantial amount of time on judges
because we have had to.
Back in the day, most of the judicial
nominees we are considering would
have been confirmed without the time-
consuming cloture vote process. By
this point in President Obama’s first
term, Republicans had required cloture
votes on just three—three—of Presi-
dent Obama’s judicial nominees. Let’s
compare that to today.
As of yesterday, July 24, Democrats
had required cloture votes on a stag-
gering 94 judicial nominees—94—to 3 at
this same point under President
Obama.
It is not because they are fiercely op-
posed to all of these nominees. In fact,
again and again, Democrats have
turned around and voted for the very
same judges they delayed.
Just a couple of weeks ago in the
Senate, we confirmed three district
court judges by huge bipartisan mar-
gins: 78 to 15, 80 to 14, and 85 to 10.
Clearly, these were not nominees that
Democrats bitterly opposed. Yet Demo-
crats insisted on the same old delaying
cloture vote tactic they have used with
so many judicial nominees.
I, too, am frustrated that we have
had to spend a lot of time on judges. I

miss the days when uncontroversial
nominees regularly passed without clo-
ture votes, but if my Democratic col-
leagues are going to insist on delaying
the vast majority of nominations, we
are going to have to keep spending
time on judges because, let’s remem-
ber, we are not doing these nomina-
tions for fun. This is part of our job.
We are working to fill a substantial
number of vacancies on the Federal
bench.
Despite the Senate’s efforts, the va-
cancy rate currently stands at 13.8 per-
cent—higher than the rates faced by
President Obama, President George W.
Bush, and President Clinton at this
point in their first terms.
Vacancies on the Federal bench have
consequences. Primarily, they result in
long waits to get cases heard, which
serves nobody.
It would be nice if my colleagues
across the aisle would abandon their
delaying tactics on noncontroversial
nominees and speed up the process of
filling these vacancies, but, regardless,
Republicans will continue moving for-
ward with judicial nominees.
I am very proud of the judges we are
confirming. We are putting excellent
Federal judges on the bench who are
committed to upholding the law. That
sounds like a pretty obvious require-
ment for a judge—a commitment to up-
holding the law—but too often it seems
like many on the left would prefer ac-
tivist judges who act as superlegisla-
tors, rewriting laws they disagree with
when the law doesn’t reach a result
that fits with Democrats’ political
opinions. Those kinds of judges—judges
who move beyond the law when the law
doesn’t line up with their political
agenda—are not a good thing for any-
body.
Sure, it might seem nice when an ac-
tivist judge who shares your political
opinions reaches outside the plain
meaning of the statute and rules for
your preferred outcome, but what hap-
pens when that same judge reaches be-
yond the law to your detriment? What
protections do you have if the law is no
longer the highest authority? The an-
swer is none. You don’t have any pro-
tection because at that point the judge,
not the law, has become the supreme
authority, and you are at the mercy of
his or her personal opinions.
Security, justice, equality under law,
these principles can only be main-
tained as long as we have judges who
are committed to upholding the law as
it is written and not as they would like
it to be.
If we have bad laws, we can and
should change them, but any changes
should be made by the people’s elected
representatives, as our Constitution
dictates. They should not be made by
unelected judges. Judges are meant to
interpret the law, not make it. I am
proud we have been putting judges on
the bench who will uphold the rule of
law in this country by interpreting the
law as it is written, regardless of their
personal opinions.
As I said earlier, we confirmed two
excellent judicial nominees this week.
Unfortunately, one ran into some
Democratic opposition during the con-
firmation process because he was
Catholic. That is right. Apparently, the
fact that he takes his faith seriously
enough—
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator will suspend.
The Senate will be in order. Take
your conversations outside of the
Chamber.
The Senator from South Dakota.
Mr. THUNE. Apparently, the fact
that he takes his faith seriously
enough to participate in a Catholic
charitable group, the Knights of Co-
lumbus, is enough to make him suspect
as a judge.
I had hoped we were done with Demo-
crats’ flirtation with religious tests for
public office when they questioned the
fitness of Judge Amy Coney Barrett be-
cause she takes her Catholic faith seri-
ously, but apparently Democrats think
it is perfectly legitimate to suggest
that you can’t be both a person of faith
and a nominee for the U.S. judiciary.
Let me just remind my colleagues
what article VI of the Constitution has
to say about that. Article VI states:
‘‘No religious test shall ever be re-
quired as a qualification to any office
or public trust under the United
States.’’ I repeat: ‘‘No religious test
shall ever be required as a qualification
to any office or public trust under the
United States.’’
It is deeply troubling that we have
Democrats in the U.S. Senate sug-
gesting that religious faith disqualifies
you from public office. If Democrats
are using their objections to these can-
didates’ religious faith as cover for the
fact that Democrats don’t want to con-
firm anyone who doesn’t share their
most extreme political opinions, that
is deeply troubling too.
Religious freedom is a bedrock prin-
ciple of this Nation. Our Founders con-
sidered it so important that it is the
very first freedom mentioned in the
Bill of Rights. By freedom of religion,
they didn’t mean it is OK to pray or
have religious beliefs if you do it quiet-
ly inside your home; they meant free-
dom to practice your faith in the pub-
lic square, even if that means having
different political opinions from Demo-
crats.
I hope Judge Buescher is the last
nominee who will have his fitness for
public office questioned simply because
he chooses to live out his faith. I was
glad to vote to confirm him yesterday,
and I look forward to confirming more
qualified judicial nominees in the near
future.
I hope the Democrats will drop their
delaying tactics and join us as we work
to fill these important vacancies on the
Federal bench.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.

BRAUN). Without objection, it is so or-

f
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this
morning, the Senate Finance Com-
mittee marked up a legislative package
that was designed to address the high
prescription drug costs, which have be-
come a burden to Americans of all
ages. This is part of a bipartisan effort
to make targeted reforms to our
healthcare system in order to lower
costs for patients and taxpayers with-
out interfering with the free market or
the beneficial innovation that comes
from it.
Last month, the Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions Committee and
the Judiciary Committee passed legis-
lative packages that were designed to
support this goal. This morning, the
Finance Committee passed a package
called the Prescription Drug Pricing
Reduction Act. This legislation looks
specifically at reducing prescription
drug prices, particularly out-of-pocket
costs, for seniors and children through
Medicare and Medicaid reforms.
I have heard a lot from my constitu-
ents in Texas about the impact of these
high costs.
Bob from San Angelo told me that
both he and his wife have Medicare
Part D and are struggling to stretch
their retirement incomes far enough to
cover the expenses for their prescrip-
tion drugs. He told me, each month,
they pay nearly $800 for Medicare and
Medicare supplements. On top of that,
they are strapped with high prescrip-
tion drug costs. In the first 41⁄2 months
of this year, Bob said they spent more
than $1,600 on his wife’s medication
alone. For seniors who live on fixed in-
comes, these high costs can simply be
untenable.
Then there is Michael, another one of
my constituents, who told me about
his continued struggle to cover the
cost of his medication. He said: ‘‘It
feels like we are being taken advantage
of because they know we have to take
these drugs.’’
These individuals have been paying
into this system for decades, and it is
high time we look at ways to reduce
the financial strain and provide some
relief.
Now, coming up with policies that
will lower out-of-pocket costs is not
easy. The whole drug pricing regime is
enormously complex—frankly, it is
opaque—particularly the relationships
between pharmacy benefit managers
and drug manufacturers, but we need
to work hard at this effort to lower
costs in Medicare and Medicaid and to
decrease the high cost of prescription
drugs even in the commercial markets.
I appreciate the commitment of
Chairman GRASSLEY and Ranking
Member WYDEN to identify potential
reforms, and I believe the package that
was voted out of the Finance Com-
mittee this morning is a step in the

right direction. This is not a statement
of endorsement of the legislation as it
has come out of the committee. A lot
of work needs to be done, particularly
a lot of work in order to reconcile the
different approaches of the different
committees—the Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions Committee and
the Judiciary Committee—because the
last thing we want to do is to go
through this arduous, complex legisla-
tive exercise only to find out that we
have failed to lower out-of-pocket costs
for American consumers or that we
have introduced some other unintended
consequence that makes things worse
and not better.
The journey a drug takes from re-
search and development to manufac-
turing, to pharmacy shelves, and even-
tually into our medicine cabinets is
enormously complicated.
As I said, once a consumer has pur-
chased a drug, figuring out who gets
what part of each dollar requires—well,
I was going to say it requires a Ph.D. It
requires even more than that because
you may need to hire an ex-FBI agent
to try to track down what percentage
of each dollar each of the players in the
prescription drug field actually gets.
As a consumer, this is particularly
alarming because we don’t really have
any idea of whether we are paying a
fair price or who is profiting and at
what point or whether people are doing
things that benefit their bottom lines.
They don’t actually add value to the
system. Ultimately, they end up cost-
ing consumers more out of pocket.
When it comes to Medicare and Med-
icaid, it is doubly concerning because,
in most cases, these prescriptions are
being at least partially subsidized by
taxpayer dollars. So we need to shine a
bright light on the reasons behind
these high costs and price increases to
make sure patients aren’t being gouged
and to make sure the government—in
other words, the taxpayer—isn’t being
overcharged. That is one of the pri-
mary goals of this legislation. It would
require manufacturers to report infor-
mation about price increases to the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices as part of that transparency effort.
As I suggested a moment ago, it also
looks at the role of pharmacy benefit
managers who are the intermediaries
who link manufacturers to consumers.
They negotiate with the manufacturers
to secure rebates, which create a net
price, but it doesn’t appear that, by
and large, this actually flows to the
consumer or to the patient. Fre-
quently, it is used, we are told, to keep
premiums lower by the health plans.
Yet we don’t know that for sure be-
cause trying to get access to the infor-
mation is really challenging, and the
size of the rebate could mean the dif-
ference between a drug’s being covered
by insurance or not. Oh, by the way, re-
bates don’t help you at all for your
copay or for your deductible.
These days, we know, for example,
for many Americans, the Affordable
Care Act has resulted in sky-high
deductibles and high premiums. That
means consumers have to pick up more
of the cost at the list price, not at the
net price, which is negotiated by the
pharmacy benefit managers who work
together with the healthcare plans.
I find it very strange, with as big a
role as the pharmacy benefit managers
play, that we know very little about
how they operate or whether they all
operate exactly the same or dif-
ferently. This legislation would require
pharmacy benefit managers to disclose
details of the discounts of rebates they
receive and finally pull back that cloak
of secrecy.
I do have concerns about one portion
of the bill that was voted out of the Fi-
nance Committee this morning, which
would require manufacturers to pay a
rebate on drug price increases that are
higher than the rate of inflation. The
Congressional Budget Office has esti-
mated the inflation rebate will save $50
billion for Medicare. It claims it will
lower out-of-pocket costs for bene-
ficiaries by $7 billion and lower pre-
miums by $4 billion.
I asked the head of the CBO this
morning: Well, if everybody saves
money, who ends up paying more
money? It basically comes out of the
manufacturer’s hide.
This really speaks to my other major
concern, and that is that the Federal
Government not get into a position in
which it is setting prices. We know
that when you institute price controls
on a commodity—particularly if you
are the Federal Government—and when
you try to negotiate with somebody, it
is not a level playing field. When you
negotiate with somebody as the Fed-
eral Government, you are literally
doing it with a gun to one’s head or
figuratively doing it with a gun to
one’s head. It is not a normal give-and-
take negotiation. Ultimately, what
happens with price controls is it cre-
ates scarcity because, at some point,
the manufacturer or the producer of
that commodity will say: I am not
going to produce that at that con-
trolled price by the government. So
this is a serious concern.
The CBO also estimates that this re-
bate would reduce costs for prescrip-
tion drug benefits offered by commer-
cial insurance plans. Although we don’t
have a final score by the CBO—this is
just a preliminary plan—I will share
with you an observation made years
ago by Senator Bob Bennett, of Utah,
when I first came to the Senate.
He said: The one thing I can tell you
about CBO scores is that they are al-
ways wrong. I can’t tell you if they are
too high or too low, but this is part of
the complexity of trying to predict the
future and how human behavior will af-
fect their calculations and analyses.
Sometimes they get it right, and some-
times they get it wrong.
Despite the encouraging estimates,
many members of the committee had
significant concerns that this policy
could lead to higher launch prices or
higher out-of-pocket spending. So this
morning in the markup, I supported an
amendment by our friend from Penn-
sylvania, Senator TOOMEY, that would
have removed this inflation rebate pen-
alty. Unfortunately, it failed on a tie
vote. It is something I don’t think I
have seen before, in which 14 Senators
voted for it and 14 voted against it, but
it means the amendment failed.
Here is the problem. There is a deli-
cate balance between preventing price
increases, which is something we would
all like to do, and still preserving the
market-based approach that has made
Part D such an overwhelming success.
It actually is a government program
that works better than we thought it
would when it was passed.
I think we need more input before
this bill comes to the floor, for there is
a lot of work yet to do. As the old
adage goes, anything worth doing is
worth doing right, and we had better
get this right. I think there will be
quite a price to pay if we undertake
this huge exercise and end up failing to
reduce consumers’ out-of-pocket costs
or creating more problems as a result
of unintended consequences. Providing
our seniors peace of mind when it
comes to their healthcare costs is cer-
tainly worth doing right.
So I believe we need to continue re-
fining this proposal to strike a better
balance and effectively deliver on our
promises. It is important that we not
rush this process. There is no artificial
deadline. There shouldn’t be. That is
why the Senate was created, to force
deliberation in a body of 100 Senators
with challenging rules to actually get
things to the President’s desk for his
signature. But what it should do is
force deliberation and force us to do
our due diligence to make sure that we
are not creating more problems or fail-
ing to accomplish our goal.
I told members of the committee this
morning that I don’t think this bill, as
written, is anywhere near ready to be
considered on the floor. I asked the
chairman and the ranking member to
commit to continue working with
Members before this does come to the
floor, and I was glad that both of them
agreed to do so.
While I believe we are making some
progress, we better be very careful, and
we shouldn’t impose on ourselves any
artificial deadlines in order to get this
thing done and perhaps get it done
badly.
I yield the floor.

DEBT CEILING
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, there is a
quote that has long been attributed to
St. Augustine, who, during his conver-
sion to Christianity, famously uttered
a prayer: Lord, help me be chaste.
Grant me chastity, but not yet.
The idea behind this is as old as
human nature itself, which is that it is
easier to have a thought of doing some-
thing later than to do that thing now,
especially when it is a difficult task.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5096 July 25, 2019
It is one of the reasons New Year’s
resolutions often result in a spike, an
abrupt increase in gym enrollments
and memberships. People develop New
Year’s resolutions; they decide they
are going to lose weight; they are going
to exercise more; they are going to eat
less. Then it becomes more difficult as
time goes by, and perhaps over time,
some of them might find it easier to
say: Well, I will lose weight later in the
year.
After starting the new year off to a
good start, they might say: Well, I will
lose more weight in the last half of the
year. Later in the year it might occur
to them that they will lose more
weight in the last 2 months of the year.
Regardless, as they continue to delay
that moment, the task doesn’t get easi-
er; it often gets harder.
The budget and spending and debt
limit deal that was announced earlier
this week reminds me a little bit of
this aspect of human nature. It is un-
derstandable why this happens. It is es-
pecially understandable why it happens
in a place where people are elected and
where people want to be liked, where
supporting greater government spend-
ing often results in praise, and calling
for even a mild tapping on the brakes
often results in rather severe criticism
in the press, even by one’s own con-
stituents. But that doesn’t mean that
we can pretend things are different
than they really are.
So, yes, you can suspend the debt
ceiling, and you can waive budget
rules, but you can’t suspend or waive
or ignore the laws of mathematics.
We have to remember that at a time
when we are talking about a signifi-
cant expansion of the role of the Fed-
eral Government, when we are talking
about suspending the debt ceiling for
an additional 2 years, we are talking
about paving the way for us to spend a
whole lot more money through the
Federal Government than we would
otherwise spend.
This is occurring at a time when
Americans are already required to
work many weeks and, in some cases,
many months out of every year just to
pay their Federal taxes. In addition to
this, after that they are told: By the
way, that is not enough.
It is not nearly enough because, for a
long time, the Federal Government has
been spending a lot more money than
it takes in. Lately, it has been to the
tune of many hundreds of billions of
dollars a year.
We have never in our history brought
in more money or as much money into
the Federal Government’s coffers as we
are bringing in right now. We are at
the very top of the business cycle. We
have nearly record-low unemployment,
in the range of roughly 4 percent or a
little below, which is, we are told by
economists, basically full employment
in America. At a time when all of these
things seem to be going our way and
we are enjoying a period of relative
peace in the world and in our country,
we have record-breaking deficits, and
this budget and debt ceiling deal would
expand the path, would pave the path
for even more of that.
That begs the question: If we can’t
control spending now, when the econ-
omy is performing about as well as it
possibly can, then when can we?
To borrow a phrase from John F.
Kennedy, ‘‘If not us, who? If not now,
when?’’
Let’s talk for a minute about Amer-
ica’s history with expanding its debt
limit, expanding its debt footprint.
What we see through this chart that
I have to my right is that during a
number of periods of crisis in American
history, we have accumulated more
debt—that is, a more-than-average
amount of debt—as a percentage of our
gross domestic product.
We see various peaks, most of them
following and brought about as a result
of a major war and, in some cases,
some other type of crisis.
We have the Revolutionary War. The
Revolutionary War was fought and,
mercifully, won, and our debt as a per-
centage of GDP went down.
It peaked a little bit a few years later
when we had to fight the War of 1812.
We won that war, too, and then debt as
a percentage of our GDP went down. It
remained low for many decades.
When we fought the Civil War, it
peaked again. It went back to close to
40 percent of our gross domestic prod-
uct. The Civil War ended, and it went
back down.
It peaked again at World War I and
then went back down. It peaked to a
very significant degree at World War II
and then promptly went back down.
See, through this period of time fol-
lowing World War II—the late forties
into the fifties—we had a whole lot of
revenue coming in. We weren’t accu-
mulating new debt, and we were paying
off our debt at the same time that our
economy was expanding.
Consequently, even though every
year didn’t result in a balanced budget,
our debt held by the public as a Federal
Government went down as a percentage
of our gross domestic product.
But in each of these instances that I
described, there was a reason; there
was a distinct, unmistakable, finite
reason why these things happened.
Once those reasons went away, once we
had won the wars in question, our debt
as a percentage of our gross domestic
product—that is, the volume of eco-
nomic activity in America—went back
down.
We saw a couple of other peaks. We
had the Gulf war and a recession in
roughly the same period. It resulted in
an increase of debt as a percentage of
GDP. That war ended, and that reces-
sion went away, and it went back
down.
Something interesting has been hap-
pening. In the last few years, as we
came out of the great recession, as we
have enjoyed a very significant, his-
toric recovery in our economy, the
economy has been expanding, and jobs
abound. The economy in which we now
live has more people employed in basi-
cally every demographic than we would
have considered likely a few years ago.
Yet, notwithstanding that fact, our
debt as a percentage of our gross do-
mestic product continues to go up.
This graph in some ways even under-
states the matter relative to where we
were at World War II. We hit the peak
during World War II at, I believe, 106,
107 percent of gross domestic product.
We are not quite at that level yet
today by standard metrics, but if you
include in this figure not only the debt
held by the public—that is, the debt
held by those who purchase U.S. secu-
rity bonds and U.S. Treasury instru-
ments generally—if you add to that the
so-called intragovernmental debt, the
IOUs the Federal Government has writ-
ten to Social Security and Medicare to
try to make up for funds that Congress
wants access to but doesn’t have, we
are actually well over 100 percent in
terms of our debt-to-GDP ratio. In
other words, we are about where we
were at the peak of the crisis we were
addressing during World War II.
That begs the questions: When does
this end? How does this end?
There is not a world war in which we
are involved right now. We are experi-
encing relative peace. There is not a re-
cession. We are in the middle of one of
the greatest peacetime economic re-
coveries this land has ever seen.
So if not us, then who? And if not
now, then when?
Why is it that we now have to sus-
pend our debt ceiling in order to essen-
tially transfer to younger Americans,
to subsequent generations the responsi-
bility of financing the government that
we have today?
One can easily defend those things
when talking about the survival of a
nation or about a world war or about a
war in which our Nation’s survival is at
stake. We are not involved in any such
effort right now.
We are involved in some conflicts
around the world, but those are not
really what is driving this. What is
driving this is that we have a govern-
ment that is too big and too expensive.
This means a lot of things to a lot of
people. It is something that should
weigh on every American seriously. I
believe it weighs especially heavily on
younger Americans, not just younger
Americans themselves, but people who
have children and grandchildren.
I represent a State with the lowest
median age in the entire country, the
State of Utah. We are also the State
with the largest percentage of people
under the age of 18.
I would like to speak to some of
those people right now—those people
under the age of 18, especially in my
State where they are disproportion-
ately represented.
Young Americans, those who have
not yet attained the age of 18, have had
all this debt accumulate—some $22 tril-
lion now by the Federal Government—
that they are going to be responsible
for, notwithstanding the fact that all

of that debt has been accumulated at
periods in their life either before they
were born or before they were old
enough to vote.
It amounts to, in a sense, a really
pernicious form of taxation without
representation. We fought a war over
that principle, and we won that war.
We shouldn’t be doing this defiantly
without a plan for turning it around,
without a reason to have to do that—a
reason that has to do with our very
survival—without some sort of plan for
getting out of it. But instead of getting
out it, we are accelerating into it, and
that is troubling.
Some might argue, and, in fact, some
within this body and in the House of
Representatives have argued that so-
called discretionary spending is not
worth worrying about. Discretionary
spending, for those of you not familiar
with the term, refers to that part of
the government that Congress decides
on each and every year that isn’t
predecided the way our entitlement
programs are.
In other words, mandatory or entitle-
ment spending, spending on things like
Social Security and Medicare that are
already set aside—those are things we
don’t have discretion over. They are al-
ready called for by law. We already
have to spend money on them.
There are those in Congress who will
maintain that we shouldn’t worry
about discretionary spending, which is
the primary focus of this measure, of
this budget caps deal, and of this debt
ceiling deal, because, really, the bigger
picture, the bigger concern, and the
bigger threat is, in fact, about manda-
tory spending. It is the entitlement
programs, they will say, that really are
driving the looming debt crisis. But it
is important to point out that we are
not reforming those either. We couldn’t
even stick to the budget caps that both
parties in both Houses and the White
House agreed to just a few years ago.
It defies logic and reason, in my
mind, for people to say: Well, we
shouldn’t worry about discretionary
spending because mandatory spending
is really where the problem is. No one
would ever advise someone struggling
with alcohol consumption that they
shouldn’t worry about consuming too
much alcohol if they are also addicted
to something else—meth or heroin or
some other terribly addictive sub-
stance that might also be harmful to
them. The fact that you are dealing
with one problem doesn’t mean that
you don’t also have to face the other
problem. That is the concern I have
with this deal. That is the reason I
plan to vote against it.
I know and I will be the first to
admit that there are no easy solutions
here. There are no solutions that any-
one would look to and say: Yes, that
sounds like a lot of fun. I don’t want to
do that.
It reminds me of a time when my sis-
ter, Stephanie, was enrolled in a new
school shortly after my family moved
back to Utah. Stephanie was in kinder-
garten. Stephanie was asked by the
teacher, as they were testing her to try
to figure out which class she should be
in, to take out her favorite color of
crayon and write down her name. My
mom watched from a distance as the
teacher administered this test. She
knew that Stephanie knew full well
how to write her name. She watched in
a certain degree of agony as Stephanie
sat there and didn’t pick up a single
crayon.
After the test was complete and the
teacher concluded, mistakenly, that
Stephanie didn’t know how to write
her name, my mom asked her: Why
didn’t you write your name?
She said: The lady asked me to pick
out my favorite color of crayon, and
they didn’t have pink. So I didn’t write
my name.
Sometimes I wonder whether Con-
gress is in the same position as my sis-
ter Stephanie when she was at that
young age being tested. We don’t see
our favorite color of crayon. We don’t
see our favorite option. We don’t see
any easy options there.
In fact, we see a whole lot of options
that would involve putting a dent in
this problem—this growing, building
problem that I have pointed out in the
graph—and we see criticism that would
likely ensue from any one of those op-
tions. Now, I understand that. It
doesn’t mean that the laws of mathe-
matics will not eventually catch up to
us.
Winston Churchill is known to have
said of the American people that the
American people will always make the
right choice after they have exhausted
every other alternative. Now, I don’t
know whether he, in fact, said that. If
he did, in fact, say it, I don’t think he
meant it as a compliment to the Amer-
ican people, but I take it as such. It is
a compliment. It is what differentiates
us from other countries. We do, in fact,
make the right choice. We are great
not because of who we are but because
of what we do, and, generally, at least
after we have exhausted other alter-
natives, we do make the right choice—
a choice that reflects the principles of
liberty that really have always defined
us as a nation.
Those principles cannot coexist with
an effort that suggests to us that our
government is so big and has to be so
big that there is nothing we can do
about the fact that Americans are re-
quired to work weeks or months out of
every year just to pay their Federal
taxes and then be told that we are $22
trillion in debt. By the time the 2 years
contemplated under this deal have
passed, we may well be at $23 trillion,
$24 trillion, or, perhaps, approaching
$25 trillion in debt. Is it going to be
any easier then to deal with the prob-
lem than it is now? I think not.
If not us, who? If not now, when? The
way we start making steps in the right
direction is to vote against a bill—a
bill that, like this one, does not mean-
ingfully address the problem.

The Senator from Indiana.

DEBT CEILING
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I have
the good fortune every Thursday of sit-
ting here anywhere from 3 to 6, depend-
ing on what the workload is. Since I
have gotten here, as a Senator from In-
diana, as a Main Street entrepreneur,
almost everything I talk about is stuff
that I have learned back in the real
world.
Now and then, there will be a speaker
here that breaks up the monotony of
sitting there for that amount of time.
My friend and fellow Senator, Mr. LEE,
couldn’t have said it more eloquently.
You have a beautiful graph here to
show the issue. I am going to take just
a few minutes to reinforce what he
said.
When I ran for Senate, I did it out of
the frustration that it seems like only
here in DC do we hear the same things
year after year and nothing ever seems
to change. I know the responsibility of
leadership and trying to navigate
through the system. But sooner or
later, we have to simply say enough is
enough.
This year, the President, I really
think, wanted to shake the system up,
I was hoping, like back in March of
2018, when there was a continuing reso-
lution agreed to, to re-enable defense,
which, in my opinion, is probably the
most important thing the Federal Gov-
ernment should do. That might be the
last time. As Senator LEE said: Look at
the chart.
There was always a good reason in
the past, and it was generally along the
lines of defending our country. But the
ethic back then should be what the
ethic is now—like it is for every house-
hold, every State government, every
school board, and especially every busi-
ness—that you borrow money not to
consume. That is called putting it on a
credit card. In almost everything we do
in the Federal Government, there is
not a tangible asset to show for it. We
are actually spending it and consuming
it.
When you borrow money in any busi-
ness, there is a difference between ex-
penses and supplies and capital expend-
itures. We do not even talk about that.
I am going to accept the reality of
the system today. I don’t like it. I am
going to vote against the bill as well. I
have talked to my fellow Members that
we need to, sooner or later, quit saying
the same things. We need to, sooner or
later, reform the system, to actually
do things that are going to be different
from everything we have done in the
past that has led us to this.
How is it going to happen? We are
going to need to have more Senators
like Senator LEE, like myself, who get
involved and make the case. But the
only way this is really going to happen
is if Hoosiers and Americans know you
could never get by with this in your
own household.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5098 July 25, 2019
I know I could have never built a na-
tional business by doing this over 37
years. It is like in business. People al-
ways ask you: How did you get there?
I will tell you how I got there: pa-
tience, perseverance, hard work, rein-
vesting every penny I made, borrowing
money only when it made sense. And it
wasn’t for a nicer corporate head-
quarters. My office was in a mobile
home for 17 years. I appreciated low
overhead.
When you do things like that, great
opportunities come your way. To all
the people who come here from Indiana
every week somehow connected with
the Federal Government wanting more,
my advice to them is hedge your bets.
If you are dependent on an institution
like this that just is so stubborn and
will not correct itself, this trajectory
will lead to a bad day somewhere down
the road that our kids and grandkids
will deal with.
I think the other side of the aisle
does drive a lot of this mentality that
the Federal Government should do
more regardless of what it costs.
The income tax occurred about right
back in here. That became a source of
revenue for the Federal Government
that we pretty well disciplined our-
selves with, until we got to right here,
when entitlements and the mandated
spending took over the dynamic of our
Federal Government.
We have everything on auto pilot
here where you can’t even discuss it.
From Medicaid, Medicare, Social Secu-
rity, and interest on our debt to about
another 10 to 15 percent that we have
moved from discretionary to manda-
tory—another gimmick here—it is only
30 percent of the budget that we can
deal with. Senator LEE talked about it.
All of that we know, and all I am
asking leadership and the President,
when we do win in 2020—because I
think we will, because anybody that is
proposing ideas like the Green New
Deal, Medicare for All, free college tui-
tion, and getting rid of college debt is
only going to add fuel to the fire—is
that we as fiscal conservatives are
going to have to be heard, and leader-
ship and the President are going to
have to hear us.
Even though it is not going to happen
this time, we shouldn’t be afraid to
talk about it, because everyone else in
our country—households, school
boards, businesses, and State govern-
ments—does. That is because they have
the common sense to live within their
means, not loot the bank in the present
and shovel all these troubles onto fu-
ture generations.

SMITH. This bill is necessary because
we know foreign actors are working to
influence our elections. The Mueller re-
port showed us how Russia interfered
in 2016, and we can expect it to happen
again in 2020. The bill’s goal is to pro-
vide enhanced criminal penalties to
prevent foreign interference in our
elections. The bill makes five changes
to current law in order to accomplish
that.
First, it explicitly makes it a crime
to work with foreign nationals to
interfere in U.S. elections.
Second, the bill prohibits Americans
from helping foreign nationals funnel
illegal contributions or donations into
U.S. elections.
Third, the bill expands restrictions
on foreign-financed election ads. Nota-
bly, it restricts foreign-financed issue
ads and foreign-financed digital ads.
Fourth, the bill creates a civil action
so that when the Attorney General
learns of foreign interference, the Jus-
tice Department can immediately get
an injunction.
And fifth, the bill modifies immigra-
tion law so if a non-U.S. citizen is con-
victed of interfering in our elections,
they would be inadmissible into the
United States.
Unless we take action, Russia or an-
other foreign power will interfere with
our elections. It is not a question of if,
it is a question of when.
We need to make clear that such in-
terference will result in criminal pun-
ishment, and we must update our elec-
tion laws to combat these new cyber
attacks.
This bill accomplishes both. Thank
you.

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF ‘‘APOLLO
11’’
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today
I wish to recognize the 50th anniver-
sary of the moon landing and New
Hampshire’s role in this important mo-
ment of history.
On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and
Buzz Aldrin completed their 13th orbit
around the Moon and fired up the de-
scent engine on the now-historic Eagle
Apollo Lunar Module. With pilot Mi-
chael Collins staying behind in the
command module, Columbia, these
American heroes, with the entire world
watching and backed by a whole gen-
eration of scientists, engineers, and
specialists supporting them on the
ground, began their initial descent to
be the first humans to set foot on an-
other planetary body.
What many Americans may not know
is that as both pilots began their his-
toric descent, critical New Hampshire-
made technology was helping them
along the way. Sensors made by RdF
Corporation in Hudson were a part of
the lunar module propulsion system
guiding them to the lunar surface. RdF
sensors were also on their spacesuits as
they took that first giant leap for man-
kind.
RdF, which continues to support the
National Aeronautics and Space Ad-
ministration, NASA, as it looks to re-
turn to the Moon and then Mars, is just
one of the many innovative small busi-
nesses in the Granite State that have
played such a critical role in our coun-
try’s space program.
For example, the Saturn V rocket
program, which launched the Apollo
crews to the Moon, benefitted from a
state-of-the-art computerized system
which was developed at Sanders Associ-
ates in Nashua, now a part of BAE Sys-
tems. HaighFarr in Bedford has been in
business for over 50 years designing
complex antennas for the space pro-
gram and has played a significant role
in our Mars lander and rover programs.
Mikrolar, in Hampton, manufactures
high precision positioning systems and
is a critical piece of the James Webb
Telescope, which will be the successor
to the Hubble sometime in the next
decade.
The fact is that New Hampshire’s
pioneering and innovative small busi-
ness community has been a mainstay
in the aerospace community for dec-
ades and remains so today. As the
ranking member on the Appropriations
Subcommittee that oversees and funds
NASA, I am supportive of NASA’s ef-
forts to get us back to the Moon and
eventually Mars, particularly because I
know Granite State businesses will be
leading those efforts.
It is not just the private sector in
New Hampshire that has stepped up to
keep us competitive in science and
space. It is also our educational com-
munity. The University of New Hamp-
shire, UNH, is a key contributor to
NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter,
which has been in orbit around the
Moon since 2009. The New Hampshire
Space Grant Consortium, which in-
cludes nine Granite State affiliates, in-
cluding UNH, Dartmouth, and our very
own McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Cen-
ter, is focused on educating our future
scientists and space technicians.
A true accounting of New Hamp-
shire’s role in space would not be com-
plete without calling attention to two
of our State’s most impressive space-
faring heroes: Alan Shepard and
Christa McAuliffe.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5099
July 25, 2019
Alan Shepard was from Derry and is
better known to the rest of the world
as the first American in space. His his-
toric 1961 Mercury flight paved the way
for the Apollo missions to the Moon. I
am also reminded that, as the com-
mander of the follow-on Apollo 14 mis-
sion, he also became the first human to
golf on the Moon’s surface.
Christa McAuliffe’s legacy as an ad-
vocate for her students and for science
education continues to inspire to this
day. New Hampshire and the entire
country are proud of her pioneering ef-
forts. Earlier this month, the entire
U.S. Senate honored that legacy and
passed my legislation authorizing the
U.S. Mint to produce a commemorative
coin in her honor.
As we continue to celebrate these
American achievements, we also cele-
brate the New Hampshire businesses,
institutions, and people who helped
make that possible and remember the
pride Americans everywhere felt that
day.
I also hope that the 50th anniversary
of the Moon landing will serve as a
wake-up call to all of us, a statement
of the great things our country can do
when we stand united, working to-
gether, and focused on a common goal.
We need more of that today. I hope we
will look to heroes like Christa
McAuliffe, Alan Shepard, and the Apol-
lo 11 crew as we rededicate ourselves as
a nation to achieving the impossible.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD
OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS
LOCAL 158
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, today
I wish to recognize the 100th anniver-
sary of the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers Local 158 from
Green Bay, WI. The original charter of
Local 158 was filed on June 6, 1919.
IBEW Local 158 occupies a storied
place in the history of organized labor
in northeast Wisconsin. Electrical
workers in Green Bay began organizing
for better wages and working condi-
tions as early as 1902. By 1919, the
workers had a committed core of elec-
trical workers and filed the charter to
establish a chapter of the IBEW on
June 6 of that year. On June 17, 1919,
the Local held its first meeting at the
home of Brother August Verheyden.
The Local increased its influence and
magnified its voice by joining other
groups advocating for workers and
their families. In 1921, IBEW Local 158
joined the State Federation of Labor,
the Green Bay Labor Council, and the
Green Bay Building Trades.
Construction of paper mills and pow-
erplants in the Fox Valley created
steady employment for IBEW mem-
bers. Their experience was especially
important when the call for skilled
labor went out during World War II to
help build ships for the U.S. Navy.
After the surprise attack on Pearl Har-
bor, the Navy rapidly began building
low-cost cargo ships called Liberty
Ships, as well as smaller torpedo patrol
and submarine chaser boats. Members
of IBEW Local 158, along with their
brethren from Local 1012 at the
Leathem D. Smith Shipbuilding Com-
pany in Sturgeon Bay, stepped up to
this challenge and contributed to the
successful U.S. war effort.
IBEW Local 158 continued its signifi-
cant contributions to the Green Bay
economy and community through its
work on Green Bay’s City Hall, which
opened in 1957. That same year, the
Local celebrated its contribution to
the completion of the Lake Michigan
pipeline and the new City Stadium,
home of the Green Bay Packers.
In the early 1970s, Local 158 merged
with three other Wisconsin IBEW orga-
nizations: Local 751 in Manitowoc,
Local 1012 in Sturgeon Bay, and Local
1235 in Marinette, making Local 158 a
stronger, more diverse and financially
sound Local in the Brotherhood.
In recent times, the skills and exper-
tise of Local 158 members are on dis-
play at nearby nuclear power stations,
paper mills, shipyards, and hospitals.
In 2003, IBEW contributed to the sig-
nificant renovations at Lambeau Field,
a landmark we in Wisconsin like to
refer to as the ‘‘8th Wonder of the
World.’’
IBEW Local 158, however, is known
for far more than its economic achieve-
ments. Its members also deserve rec-
ognition for their significant contribu-
tions to their community through gen-
erous charitable initiatives. In addi-
tion, its advocacy on behalf of family
supporting wages has helped build the
strong middle class Green Bay enjoys
today.
On this important day, marking 100
years of outstanding service to its
members, its union, and its commu-
nity, I heartily congratulate IBEW
Local 158 on its successful advocacy on
behalf of working families, and I wish
its members continued progress for the
next 100 years.

RECOGNIZING THE FREEPORT
FLAG LADIES
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I
wish to pay tribute to three great pa-
triots, three inspiring women, from the
town of Freeport, ME. Their names are
Elaine Greene, Carmen Footer, and
JoAnn Miller. They are known by our
men and women in uniform, veterans,
and grateful citizens throughout Amer-
ica as the Freeport Flag Ladies.
On September 11, 2001, an act of ter-
ror transformed a beautiful Tuesday
morning into a day of unfathomable
horror. Three days later, President
Bush asked grief-stricken Americans to
step outside their homes with lighted
candles in memory of the heroes of 9/11
and of the nearly 3,000 innocent men,
women, and children who perished.
Living on a secluded road, Elaine,
Carmen, and JoAnn instead took their
candles and an American flag to busy
Main Street. Their location quickly
began a rallying point for all of Free-
port, the site of a spontaneous, heart-
felt memorial service.
Then they did something even more
remarkable. They made a promise to
stand with their flags on Main Street
each and every Tuesday morning be-
tween the hours of 8 and 9, to mark the
day and time of the attacks.
This coming September 11th will be
their final vigil. When that day comes,
they will have kept their promise for
more than 900 consecutive Tuesdays, in
rain, sleet, and snow, in bitter cold and
in blistering heat. Carmen, the young-
est of the three at 74, says their ‘‘re-
tirement’’ is due solely to the fact that
‘‘Age wins, all the time.’’
For the past 4 years, the Freeport
Flag Ladies have been joined each
Tuesday by Darlene Jolly and fre-
quently by Elaine’s sister, Amy Gove.
They have kept their promise, and
they have done so much more. From
2002 to 2016, they spearheaded a won-
derful 9/11 tribute in Freeport. They
have regularly made the long drive to
Bangor International Airport, to join
the legendary Maine Troop Greeters,
and to Pease International Airport in
New Hampshire, to meet the members
of our Armed Forces as they head over-
seas or return home. They have greeted
thousands of soldiers, and they are re-
membered by them all.
They have made a special effort to
reach out to those who serve our coun-
try and to their families. Thousands of
photographs of outbound troops have
been sent back home, and families re-
ceive a weekly message. They have
sent packages of games, magazines,
and food to troops overseas. Parcels to
combat support hospitals contain
clothing and special pillows to make
the transport of wounded soldiers more
comfortable. They have funded these
amazing efforts themselves, with yard
sales, growing and selling ‘‘Flowers for
Freedom,’’ and donations.
Describing what Elaine Greene, Car-
men Footer, and JoAnn Miller have
done falls far short of putting into
words what the Freeport Flag Ladies
mean to our country. Perhaps the best
words were spoken by Elaine: ‘‘Free-
dom shines on America, so let us shine
for America.’’ The Freeport Flag La-
dies shine brightly, and their light will
continue to inspire us all. Their prayer
to be of service was answered with a
mission to commemorate, to honor,
and to remember. They are among
those throughout our Nation who
transformed one of America’s darkest
days into one of our finest hours.
Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I
wish to recognize the Flag Ladies of
Freeport, ME, who will soon retire
from their unwavering efforts to com-
memorate the heroes and the victims
of the life-changing events that oc-
curred on September 11, 2001. Every
Tuesday since that day—for 18 years—
the Freeport Flag Ladies have stood on
Main Street in Freeport in our Na-
tion’s colors waving our Nation’s flag.
First standing to honor the lives lost
in the 2001 attacks, these ladies have

continued to stand to support the
brave men and women who serve our
country today. Main Street shall see
them wave the red, white, and blue for
the last time on September 11, 2019.
In the days after the events of Sep-
tember 11, Elaine Greene, Carmen
Footer, and Joann Miller were just like
the rest of the country: they wanted to
heal the Nation. So they acted, devot-
ing their time and energy to honor and
salute those who were lost and those
who are willing to make the greatest
sacrifice our Nation can ask. Since be-
ginning their effort, these ladies have
not missed a single Tuesday to share
their message of patriotism and soli-
darity. Nothing could deter them, not
the heaviest rains, the coldest snows,
the blazing summer sun or even a dis-
located shoulder. The Freeport Flag
Ladies have showed up every week—no
matter what.
When troops were deployed to Af-
ghanistan and later Iraq, these women
took this as an expansion of their man-
date—traveling up to Bangor to send
off soldiers and greet those returning
home. The Freeport Flag Ladies have
given up much themselves to ensure
their mission is carried out week after
week. Their own comfort has been for-
gone in their pursuit to bring comfort
to their fellow countrymen. In waving
the flag and shaking the hands of sol-
diers, Elaine Greene, Carmen Footer,
and Joann Miller have represented the
best of our Nation and the ideals of the
flag they wave.
I want to thank the Freeport Flag
Ladies for their commitment to hon-
oring both the lives lost on September
11, 2001, and the soldiers who are cur-
rently serving and defending the
United States. Their mission is not po-
litical. It is clear that what they do is
an act of love and appreciation for the
great sacrifices made by those who
serve our country. These unwavering
patriots are a reminder to the Amer-
ican people of what the flag represents.
While they may wave their flags for
the final time on September 11, 2019,
the patriotism of these women will
continue to be remembered and cele-
brated.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY OF
MISSOURI CENTER FOR MIS-
SOURI STUDIES
∑ Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, today, I
stand to recognize the grand opening of
the State Historical Society of Mis-
souri’s Center for Missouri Studies on
August 10. The Center for Missouri
Studies was established in 2014, and
this new facility will move the State
Historical Society from its home of 100
years to a new, visionary center meant
to connect scholars of varied dis-
ciplines, showcase artwork by re-
nowned Missourians, and provide state-
of-the-art space for educational pro-
gramming.
The State Historical Society of Mis-
souri was founded in 1898 by the Mis-
souri Press Association and has been
an integral part of the preservation of
Missouri’s history ever since. Not only
does it support research at centers in
Cape Girardeau, Columbia, Kansas
City, Rolla, St. Louis, and Springfield,
it also houses an extensive collection
of manuscripts, newspapers, books,
maps, photographs, and art. Thanks to
the efforts of dedicated staff over dec-
ades, the public can explore the
records, myths, and culture that com-
prise the rich history of our State,
The new Center for Missouri Studies
will build upon the State Historical So-
ciety’s mission to ‘‘collect, preserve,
publish, exhibit, and make available’’
to the public myriad resources and op-
portunities to learn. The center will
feature a large art gallery, multipur-
pose and classroom space, an expanded
research center, and modern conserva-
tion lab space. Not only will the public
have greater access to historical ar-
chives and artwork, expert scholars
will be able to study and examine the
society’s extensive collections in a
space designed to facilitate collabora-
tion.
The commitment of the State Histor-
ical Society of Missouri to preserve our
history as we look forward to the be-
ginning of a third century in our State
is to be commended. The potential for
the public to enjoy our State’s unique
past with greater ease cannot be under-
valued. The dedication of the State
Historical Society to drive this project
to completion serves as an example to
others. I extend my sincere thanks for
all they do. Congratulations to Execu-
tive Director Gary Kremer and all
State Historical Society of Missouri
staff on this important occasion.∑

TRIBUTE TO CHLOE JEAN
MILSTEN
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this
week I have the honor of recognizing
Chloe Jean Milsten of Park County for
her spirit of entrepreneurship in Liv-
ingston.
While still in high school, Ms.
Milsten opened and operated her own
business, Chloe’s Barkery. Located in
downtown Livingston, Chloe’s Barkery
sells dog treats to the Park County
community. Now, after her high school
graduation, she continues to manage
the shop, providing Montanans with a
unique, healthy bakery tailored for
dogs.
Ms. Milsten’s family has been a tre-
mendous support system during her
business endeavors. Her parents were
some of her biggest influences in en-
couraging her to launch her business.
Additionally, her younger sister
Taeyha assists in the day-to-day oper-
ations of the store. Chloe’s Barkery is
the perfect example of a successful
family-operated business that we can
all be proud of in Montana.
Ms. Milsten’s interest in animals is
not merely related to her entrepre-
neurial spirt, but also that she hopes to
become a veterinarian one day. I ap-
plaud Ms. Milsten for her impressive
motivation and perseverance in owning
and operating a successful small busi-
ness, and I look forward to seeing all
she accomplishes in the future.∑
f
TRIBUTE TO CAROLINE DILLON
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am
proud to recognize Caroline Dillon of
Rochester, NH, as July’s Granite
Stater of the Month for her work en-
suring that every public high school
and middle school in New Hampshire
provides free feminine hygiene prod-
ucts to students who cannot afford
them.
When Caroline first learned about
‘‘period poverty’’ in her high school’s
U.S. history class, she was shocked by
the magnitude of this crisis. Period
poverty occurs when someone does not
have the means to afford basic femi-
nine hygiene products. Caroline knew
many of her classmates were on the re-
duced or free lunch program, and it did
not take long for her to connect the
dots and realize that some of her class-
mates were struggling with this prob-
lem every month.
Caroline turned her concern into po-
litical action. She took her history
teacher’s advice, who told Caroline’s
class that, if they ever had a problem
with how things were run in the State,
they should reach out to an elected of-
ficial. She reached out to State Sen-
ator Martha Hennessey, an outspoken
advocate for women’s health and edu-
cation.
Caroline, who at the time was not old
enough to vote, worked with Senator
Hennessey to draft the bill and to gain
support for their legislation in the New
Hampshire State House and among in-
terest groups. Their argument was sim-
ple: If students do not need to bring es-
sentials like toilet paper to school,
why should they need to bring their
own feminine hygiene products, which
are just as essential?
Thanks to Caroline’s efforts, the New
Hampshire Governor last week signed
into law a bill that mandates that
every high school and middle school in
the Granite State provide free feminine
hygiene products in their female and
gender-neutral bathrooms.
I want to thank Caroline once more
for her work to help reduce the stigma
around periods and to provide essential
feminine hygiene products for those in
need. I want to congratulate her as
well for demonstrating how powerful
individual compassion and advocacy
can be in our democracy.∑

f
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr.
BLUMENTHAL, Mr. WHITEHOUSE,
Mr. MERKLEY, Ms. BALDWIN, Ms.
WARREN, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, and
Mr. BROWN):
S. 2268. A bill to amend the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 to expand the de-
nial of deduction for certain excessive
remuneration, and for other purposes;
to the Committee on Finance.
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am intro-
ducing the Stop Subsidizing Multi-
million Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act
with Senators BLUMENTHAL, WHITE-
HOUSE, MERKLEY, BALDWIN, WARREN,
VAN HOLLEN, and BROWN. This legisla-
tion would end special tax deductions
for huge executive bonuses by closing a
loophole that still allows publicly trad-
ed corporations to deduct the cost of
multimillion-dollar bonuses from their
corporate tax bills. U.S. taxpayers
shouldn’t have to subsidize these mas-
sive bonuses.
Under section 162(m) of the tax code
as amended by the 2017 Trump tax law
(TCJA), when a publicly traded cor-
poration calculates its taxable income,
it is generally permitted to deduct the
cost of compensation from its reve-
nues, with limits up to $1 million for
some of the firm’s most senior execu-
tives.
In the last Congress, the TCJA closed
some of the pre-existing 162(m) loop-
holes by incorporating provisions from
my Stop Subsidizing Multimillion Dol-
lar Corporate Bonuses Act, including
removing the exemption for perform-
ance-based compensation, which pre-
viously permitted compensation deduc-
tions above $1 million when executives
met performance benchmarks set by
the corporation’s Board of Directors.
In addition, a technical correction
from my bill to ensure that all publicly
traded corporations that are required
to provide quarterly and annual re-
ports to their investors under Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission rules
and regulations are subject to section
l62(m) was also included in the TCJA.
Previously, this section of the tax code
only covered some publicly traded cor-
porations who are required to provide
these periodic reports to their share-
holders.
While these were positive steps, even
more should have been done, such as
applying section 162(m) to all employ-
ees of publicly traded corporations so
that all compensation is subject to a
deductibility cap of $1 million. This
was the lone provision from my Stop
Subsidizing Multimillion Dollar Cor-
porate Bonuses Act from the 115th Con-
gress that was not incorporated into
the Trump tax law.
Partially closing these 162(m) loop-
holes saved taxpayers $9.2 billion ac-
cording to the Joint Committee on
Taxation (JCT), but according to
Americans for Tax Fairness, ‘‘Extend-
ing the $1 million deductibility cap to
all forms of compensation for all em-
ployees might generate about $20 bil-
lion over 10 years. This is based on
JCT’s original $50 billion revenue esti-
mate, discounted to $30 billion because
of the 40% corporate tax cut, and sub-
tracting the $9.2 billion already being
raised by the TCJA’s partial reform.’’
This is why we are introducing a re-
vised version of the Stop Subsidizing
Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses
Act to finish what was started. Our leg-
islation would extend section 162(m) to
all employees of publicly traded cor-
porations so that all compensation is
subject to a deductibility cap of $1 mil-
lion. Publicly traded corporations
would still be permitted to pay their
executives as much as they desire, but
compensation above and beyond $1 mil-
lion would no longer be subsidized by
other hardworking taxpayers through
our tax code.
Our legislation tackles this issue
head on by ending the public subsidy of
excessive executive compensation. This
is simply a matter of fairness, ensuring
that corporations—and not hard-
working taxpayers who face their own
challenges in this economy—are paying
for the multi-million dollar bonuses
corporations have decided to dole out
to their senior executives.
We need to prioritize tax breaks that
grow our economy and strengthen the
middle class, and this bill helps elimi-
nate some of the unfairness in the tax
code.
I thank Public Citizen, the Institute
for Policy Studies, Global Economy
Project, Americans for Financial Re-
form, the AFL–CIO, and MIT Professor
Simon Johnson for their support. I also
want to thank Senator BLUMENTHAL
for working with me on this issue, and
I urge our colleagues to join us in co-
sponsoring this legislation.
By Ms. HIRONO (for herself and
Mr. TILLIS):
S. 2281. A bill to amend chapter 11 of
title 35, United States Code, to require
the voluntary collection of demo-
graphic information for patent applica-
tions, and for other purposes; to the
Committee on the Judiciary.
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise
today to introduce the Inventor Diver-
sity for Economic Advancement Act of
2019. I thank my colleague from North
Carolina, Senator TILLIS, for working
with me on this important piece of leg-
islation, which serves as a first step to
closing the diversity gap in our patent
system by collecting demographic data
on patent applicants.
Women and racial minorities have
made some of the most significant in-
ventions in this country’s history. The
$75 billion home security industry grew
from an initial home security system
invented by Marie Van Brittan Brown.
The computer would never have be-
come the multimedia device it is today
without the microcomputer system in-
vented by Mark Dean. The genetic rev-
olution would still be science fiction if
not for the CRISPR gene-editing tool
discovered by Jennifer Doudna—raised
on Hawaii’s Big Island.
We should celebrate these inventors
and the many others like them who
have contributed to innovation in this
country. But we must also recognize
the hard truth that women, racial mi-
norities, and many other groups are
greatly underrepresented in the U.S.
patent system.
The Patent and Trademark Office’s
recent report on women inventors
shines a spotlight on one part of this
problem. The PTO found that only 21
percent of U.S. patents list a woman as
an inventor and that women make up
only 12 percent of all inventors. This is
true even though women held 43 per-
cent of all full-time jobs in 2016 and 28
percent of STEM jobs in 2015.
Other reports highlight racial and in-
come patent gaps. For example, a re-
port by the Institute for Women’s Pol-
icy Research found that the percentage

of African American and Hispanic col-
lege graduates who hold patents is ap-
proximately half that of their white
counterparts. Another report found
that children born into families with
incomes below the median U.S. income
are 90 percent less likely to receive a
patent in their lifetimes than those
born into wealthier families.
Closing these gaps would turbocharge
our economy. According to a study by
Michigan State University Professor
Lisa Cook, including more women and
African Americans in the ‘‘initial stage
of the process of innovation’’ could in-
crease GDP by as much as $640 billion.
Another study by the National Bureau
of Economic Research found that
eliminating the patent gap for women
with science and engineering degrees
alone would increase GDP by over $500
billion.
It’s simply good policy and good busi-
ness to want to fully integrate people
of all types into our innovation econ-
omy.
But if we have any hope of closing
the various patent gaps, we must first
get a firm grasp on the scope of the
problem.
Studies of the demographic makeup
of patentees, like the ones I described,
are few and far between. The reason is
a simple one. A lack of data. The PTO
does not collect any data on applicants
beyond their first and last names and
city, state, and country of residence.
As a result, those wishing to study pat-
ent gaps between different demo-
graphic groups are forced to guess the
gender of an applicant based on his or
her name, determine the race or in-
come status of an applicant by cross-
referencing census data, or explore a
number of other options that are time-
consuming, unreliable, or both.
The IDEA Act solves this problem. It
would require the PTO to collect demo-
graphic data—including gender, race,
military or veteran status, and income
level, among others—from patent ap-
plicants on a voluntary basis. It would
further require the PTO to issue re-
ports on the data collected and, per-
haps more importantly, make the data
available to the public with appro-
priate protections for personally iden-
tifiable information. Outside research-
ers could therefore conduct their own
analyses and offer insights into the
various patent gaps in our society.
Let me be clear. Closing the informa-
tion gap facing researchers alone will
not solve the patent gap facing women,
racial minorities, and so many others.
But it is a critical first step. I there-
fore encourage my colleagues to sup-
port the IDEA Act.
SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS
SENATE RESOLUTION 284—CALL-
ING UPON THE UNITED STATES
SENATE TO GIVE ITS ADVICE
AND CONSENT TO THE RATIFICA-
TION OF THE UNITED NATIONS
CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF
THE SEA
Ms. HIRONO (for herself and Ms.
MURKOWSKI) submitted the following
resolution; which was referred to the
Committee on Foreign Relations:
S. RES. 284
Whereas the United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) was adopted
by the Third United Nations Conference on
the Law of the Sea in December 1982, and en-
tered into force in November 1994 to estab-
lish a treaty regime to govern activities on,
over, and under the world’s oceans;
Whereas UNCLOS builds on four 1958 Law
of the Sea conventions to which the United
States is a party, including the Convention
on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous
Zone, the Convention on the High Seas, the
Convention on the Continental Shelf, and
the Convention on Fishing and Conservation
of the Living Resources of the High Seas;
Whereas the treaty and an associated 1994
agreement relating to implementation of the
treaty were transmitted to the Senate on Oc-
tober 6, 1994, and, in the absence of Senate
advice and consent to adherence, the United
States is not a party to the convention and
the associated 1994 agreement;
Whereas the convention has been ratified
by 167 parties, which includes 166 countries
and the European Union, but not the United
States;
Whereas the United States, like most other
countries, believes that coastal states under
UNCLOS have the right to regulate eco-
nomic activities in their Exclusive Economic
Zones (EEZs), but do not have the right to
regulate foreign military activities in their
EEZs;
Whereas the treaty’s provisions relating to
navigational rights, including those in EEZs,
reflect the United States diplomatic position
on the issue dating back to UNCLOS’s adop-
tion in 1982;
Whereas becoming a party to the treaty
would reinforce the United States perspec-
tive into permanent international law;
Whereas becoming a party to the treaty
would give the United States standing to
participate in discussions relating to the
treaty and thereby improve the United
States ability to intervene as a full party to
disputes relating to navigational rights, and
to defend United States interpretations of
the treaty’s provisions, including those re-
lating to whether coastal states have a right
under UNCLOS to regulate foreign military
activities in their EEZs;
Whereas relying on customary inter-
national norms to defend United States in-
terests in these issues is not sufficient, be-
cause it is not universally accepted and is
subject to change over time based on state
practice;
Whereas relying on other countries to as-
sert claims on behalf of the United States at
the Hague Convention is woefully insuffi-
cient to defend and uphold United States
sovereign rights and interests;
Whereas the Permanent Court of Arbitra-
tion, in their July 12, 2016, ruling on the case
in the matter of the South China Sea Arbi-
tration, stated, ‘‘the Tribunal forwarded to
the Parties for their comment a Note
Verbale from the Embassy of the United
States of America, requesting to send a rep-
resentative to observe the hearing’’, and
‘‘the Tribunal communicated to the Parties
and the U.S. Embassy that it had decided
that ‘only interested States parties to the
United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea will be admitted as observers’ and
thus could not accede to the U.S. request.’’;
Whereas, on November 25, 2018, the Russian
Federation violated international norms and
binding agreements, including the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,
in firing upon, ramming, and seizing Ukrain-
ian vessels and crews attempting to pass
through the Kerch Strait;
Whereas, on May 25, 2019, the International
Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ruled in a
vote of 19–1 that ‘‘the Russian Federation
shall immediately release the Ukrainian
naval vessels Berdyansk, Nikopol and Yani
Kapu, and return them to the custody of
Ukraine,’’ and that ‘‘the Russian Federation
shall immediately release the 24 detained
Ukrainian servicemen and allow them to re-
turn to Ukraine,’’ demonstrating the Tribu-
nal’s rejection of Russia’s arguments in this
matter in relation to the Law of the Sea;
Whereas, despite the Tribunal’s ruling
aligning with the United States Govern-
ment’s position on the incident, the United
States continued nonparticipation in
UNCLOS limits the United States ability to
effectively respond to Russia’s actions in the
November 25, 2018, incident, as well as to any
potential future violations by the Russian
Federation and any other signatory of
UNCLOS;
Whereas the confirmed nominee and future
Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Bill
Moran, stated that ‘‘becoming a party to the
Convention would reinforce freedom of the
seas and the navigational rights vital to our
global force posture in the world’s largest
maneuver space. Joining the Convention
would also demonstrate our commitment to
the rule of law, and strengthen our credi-
bility with other Convention parties,’’ in re-
sponse to advance policy questions on April
30, 2019, before the Committee on Armed
Services of the Senate;
Whereas the past Secretary of the Navy,
the Honorable Ray Mabus, stated, ‘‘the
UNCLOS treaty guarantees rights such as in-
nocent passage through territorial seas;
transit passage through, under and over
international straits; and the laying and
maintaining of submarine cables,’’ and ‘‘the
convention has been approved by nearly
every maritime power and all the permanent
members of the UN Security Council, except
the United States’’, on February 16, 2012, be-
fore the Committee on Armed Services of the
Senate;
Whereas the past Secretary of the Navy,
the Honorable Ray Mabus, further stated,
‘‘Our notable absence as a signatory weakens
our position with other nations, allowing the
introduction of expansive definitions of sov-
ereignty on the high seas that undermine
our ability to defend our mineral rights
along our own continental shelf and in the
Arctic.’’, and ‘‘the Department strongly sup-
ports the accession to UNCLOS, an action
consistently recommended by my prede-
cessors of both parties’’, on February 16, 2012,
before the Committee on Armed Services of
the Senate;
Whereas the past President and current
Chief Executive Officer of the United States
Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Thomas J.
Donahue, stated, ‘‘we support joining the
Convention because it is in our national in-
terest—both in our national security and our
economic interests’’, and, ‘‘becoming a party
to the Treaty benefits the U.S. economically
by providing American companies the legal
certainty and stability they need to hire and
invest’’, and, ‘‘companies will be hesitant to

Whereas the past President and current

‘‘joining the Convention will provide the

from mineral claims in the Arctic to how

Committee on Foreign Relations of the Sen-
ate;
Whereas the past Commander of United
States Pacific Command, Admiral Samuel J.
Locklear, stated that UNCLOS is ‘‘widely ac-
cepted after a lot of years of deliberation by
many, many countries, most countries in my
Area of Responsibility (AOR)’’, and, ‘‘when
we’re not a signatory, it reduces our overall
credibility when we bring it up as a choice of

on April 16, 2015, before the Committee on
Armed Services of the Senate;
Whereas the past Commandant of the
United States Coast Guard, retired Admiral
Paul Zukunft, stated on February 12, 2016,
‘‘With the receding of the icepack, the Arctic

the Law of the Sea Convention is the gov-
erning legal regime for the Arctic Ocean . . .

‘‘Ratification of the Law of the Sea Conven-
tion supports our economic interests, envi-
ronmental protection, and safety of life at
sea, especially in the Arctic Ocean.’’;
Whereas the past Chief of Naval Oper-
ations, Admiral Jonathan Greenert, further
stated, ‘‘remaining outside Law of the Sea
Convention (LOSC) is inconsistent with our

and, ‘‘virtually every major ally of the U.S.
is a party to LOSC, as are all other perma-

and all other Arctic nations’’, on June 14,
2012, before the Committee on Armed Serv-
ices of the Senate;
Whereas the past Chief of Naval Oper-
ations, Admiral Jonathan Greenert, further
stated, ‘‘our absence [from LOSC] could pro-
vide an excuse for nations to selectively
choose among Convention provisions or
abandon it altogether, thereby eroding the
navigational freedoms we enjoy today’’, and,
‘‘accession would enhance multilateral oper-

Whereas the United States Special Rep-
resentative of State for the Arctic and
former Commandant of the Coast Guard, Ad-
miral Robert Papp, Jr., stated, ‘‘as a non-
party to the Law of the Sea Convention, the
U.S. is at a significant disadvantage relative
to the other Arctic Ocean coastal States’’,
and, ‘‘those States are parties to the Conven-
tion, and are well along the path to obtain-
ing legal certainty and international rec-

‘‘The Convention provides legal certainty in

‘‘access would strengthen the legal founda-

across the globe and would do nothing to
limit our military operations in the manner
in which we’re conducting them now’’, on
April 17, 2018, before the Committee on
Armed Services of the Senate;
Whereas the past Commander of United
States Pacific Command, retired Admiral
Harry B. Harris, stated ‘‘I believe that
UNCLOS gives Russia the potential to,
quote, unquote ‘own’ almost half of the Arc-
tic Circle, and we will not have that oppor-

Harris, stated ‘‘I think that by not signing
onto it that we lose the creditability for the
very same thing that we’re arguing for’’, and

norms in the international arena. The
United States is a beacon—we’re a beacon on
a hill but I think that light is brighter if we
sign on to UNCLOS’’, on February 23, 2016, at
a hearing before the Committee on Armed
Services of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) affirms that it is in the national inter-
est for the United States to become a formal
signatory of the United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea;
(2) urges the United States Senate to give
its advice and consent to the ratification of
the United Nations Convention on the Law
of the Sea (UNCLOS); and
(3) recommends the ratification of
UNCLOS remain a top priority for the Ad-
ministration, having received bipartisan sup-
port from every President since 1994, and
having most recently been underscored by
the strategic challenges the United States
faces in the Asia-Pacific, the Arctic, and the
Black Sea regions.

Mrs. FISCHER (for herself and Ms.
DUCKWORTH) submitted the following
resolution; which was referred to the
Committee on the Judiciary:
S. RES. 285
Whereas, every school day in the United
States, approximately 500,000 public and pri-
vate school buses carry more than 26,000,000
children to and from school;
Whereas school buses comprise the largest
mass transportation fleet in the United
States;
Whereas 48 percent of all K–12 students
ride a school bus for each of the 180 school
days in a year, totaling nearly 4,680,000,000
miles driven in school buses annually;
Whereas the Child Safety Network, cele-
brating 30 years of national public service,
supports the CSN Safe Bus campaign, which
is designed to provide the latest training,
technology, and free safety and security re-
sources to the school bus industry;
Whereas the designation of School Bus
Safety Month will allow broadcast and dig-
ital media and social networking industries
to make commitments to disseminate public
service announcements that are produced in
order—
(1) to provide free resources designed to
safeguard children;
(2) to recognize school bus drivers and pro-
fessionals; and
(3) to encourage the driving public to en-
gage in safer driving behavior near school
buses when students are boarding and dis-
embarking from the school buses;
Whereas key leaders who are deserving of
recognition during School Bus Safety Month
and beyond have provided security awareness
training materials to more than 14,000 public
and private school districts, trained more
than 100,000 school bus operators, and pro-
vided more than 150,000 counterterrorism
guides to individuals who are key to pro-
viding both safety and security for children
in the United States; and
Whereas School Bus Safety Month offers
the Senate and the people of the United
States an opportunity to recognize and
thank all of the school bus drivers in the
United States and the professionals who are
focused on school bus safety and security:

S. RES. 286
Whereas on July 26, 1908, Attorney General
Charles Bonaparte ordered newly-hired Fed-
eral investigators to report to the Office of
the Chief Examiner of the Department of
Justice, which subsequently was renamed
the Federal Bureau of Investigation;
Whereas on July 26, 1947, President Tru-
man signed the National Security Act of 1947
(50 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.), creating the Depart-
ment of Defense, the National Security
Council, the Central Intelligence Agency,
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, thereby laying
the foundation for today’s intelligence com-
munity;
Whereas the National Security Act of 1947,
which appears in title 50, United States
Code, governs the definition, composition,
responsibilities, authorities, and oversight of
the intelligence community of the United
States;
Whereas the intelligence community is de-
fined by section 3 of the National Security
Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3003) to include the Of-
fice of the Director of National Intelligence,
the Central Intelligence Agency, the Na-
tional Security Agency, the Defense Intel-
ligence Agency, the National Geospatial-In-
telligence Agency, the National Reconnais-
sance Office, other offices within the Depart-
ment of Defense for the collection of special-
ized national intelligence through reconnais-

rine Corps, the Coast Guard, the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement

ergy, the Bureau of Intelligence and Re-
search of the Department of State, the Office
of Intelligence and Analysis of the Depart-
ment of the Treasury, the elements of the
Department of Homeland Security concerned
with the analysis of intelligence informa-
tion, and other elements as may be des-
ignated;
Whereas July 26, 2019, is the 72nd anniver-
sary of the signing of the National Security
Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.);
Whereas the Intelligence Reform and Ter-
rorism Prevention Act of 2004 (Public Law
108–458; 118 Stat. 3638) created the position of
the Director of National Intelligence to serve
as the head of the intelligence community
and to ensure that national intelligence be
timely, objective, independent of political
considerations, and based upon all sources
available;
Whereas Congress has previously passed
joint resolutions, signed by the President, to
designate Peace Officers Memorial Day on
May 15, Patriot Day on September 11, and
other commemorative occasions, to honor
the sacrifices of law enforcement officers and
of those who lost their lives on September 11,
2001;
Whereas the United States has increas-
ingly relied upon the men and women of the
intelligence community to protect and de-
fend the security of the United States in the
years since the attacks of September 11, 2001;
Whereas the men and women of the intel-
ligence community, both civilian and mili-
tary, have been increasingly called upon to
deploy to theaters of war in Iraq, Afghani-
stan, and elsewhere since September 11, 2001;
Whereas numerous intelligence officers of
the elements of the intelligence community
have been injured or killed in the line of
duty;
Whereas intelligence officers of the United
States are routinely called upon to accept
personal hardship and sacrifice in the fur-
therance of their mission to protect the
United States, to undertake dangerous as-
signments in the defense of the interests of
the United States, to collect reliable infor-
mation within prescribed legal authorities
upon which the leaders of the United States
rely in life-and-death situations, and to
‘‘speak truth to power’’ by providing their
best assessments to decision makers, regard-
less of political and policy considerations;
Whereas the men and women of the intel-
ligence community have on numerous occa-
sions succeeded in preventing attacks upon
the United States and allies of the United
States, saving numerous innocent lives; and
Whereas intelligence officers of the United
States must of necessity often remain un-
known and unrecognized for their substan-
tial achievements and successes: Now, there-
fore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) designates July 26, 2019, as ‘‘United
States Intelligence Professionals Day’’;
(2) acknowledges the courage, fidelity, sac-
rifice, and professionalism of the men and
women of the intelligence community of the
United States; and
(3) encourages the people of the United
States to observe this day with appropriate
ceremonies and activities.

IN HONOR OF WILLIAM J.
NOONAN’S RETIREMENT
HON. MARK E. AMODEI
OF NEVADA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. AMODEI. Madam Speaker, on July
31st, an era will end. After a long and suc-
cessful career in government and the gaming
industry—the last 18 years of which he spent
at Boyd Gaming—William J. Noonan will re-
tire. Bill’s long career—truly an American suc-
cess story—has midwestern roots. A graduate
of Missouri State before receiving his master’s
in public administration from the University
Kansas, Bill spent years managing cities all
across this country. From Springfield, Mis-
souri, to small towns in Florida, and eventually
to Las Vegas in the 1990s, Bill’s positive en-
ergy and inspiring leadership guided cities
large and small through some of the toughest
and most exciting of economic times.
When Bill first landed in Las Vegas in 1990,
it was a city of just under a million people.
Gaming was not widely legalized throughout
the country, but was about to be . . . and Bill
sensed a boom coming. He worked with city
leaders to prepare for what was to come and
would soon take his skills into the private sec-
tor for a number of companies who needed to
understand the key relationship that exists be-
tween the gaming industry and the commu-
nities in which they operate. Bill was exactly
the right person for the job.
Since those humble beginnings of his youth,
Bill has actually run a casino, dined with US
presidents, overseen corporate philanthropies
that have donated millions to communities and
worthwhile causes, successfully recruited a
professional football team to Las Vegas, and
helped a city gather itself together after the
horrific events of October 1 in his role as
chairman of the Las Vegas Metro Chamber of
Commerce.
For his leadership to community and coun-
try, Bill’s been recognized numerous times—
by his industry as the Gaming Professional of
the Year; by his alma mater as an outstanding
alumnus; and by his state by serving on a
number of prestigious boards. But if you know
Bill, you know he really only cares about the
appreciation of those with whom he works and
the recognition of his lifelong love Sylvia and
their beautiful family . . . with whom he now
gets to spend a lot more time.
I wish my friend well. I thank him for his
contributions, and I congratulate him on his re-
tirement.

CELEBRATING THE 150TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE CITY OF ORAN
HON. JASON SMITH
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor the city of Oran in Scott
County, MO on its 150th anniversary. The city
of Oran, founded on July 16, 1869, was origi-
nally dubbed ‘‘St. Cloud’’ for the French town
outside of Paris. The city was known to locals
as ‘‘The Land of the Watermelon.’’
After some debate in the community and the
opening of a new post office in 1882, the city
officially decided on the name Oran. Captain
Ward L. Smith, a retired sailor, selected the
name Oran in honor of the second most im-
portant city in Algeria, which he had visited
during his time in the Navy. Oran is a North
African word for lion and is historically associ-
ated with the Berber legend of ‘‘the Mountain
of Lions.’’
Traditions are a staple in Oran. Over the
years, the city has hosted fall festivals, town
celebrations, and picnics. Its most famous tra-
dition is the Fourth of July picnic, which dates
to 1908. Since its inception, the picnic has
been celebrated annually except for a three–
year break during World War II. The picnic
features a multitude of activities for families
and a firework show. The celebrations attract
people from all walks of life each year.
Today, the city maintains its familiar farm
town character, even with a growing popu-
lation of over 1,300 residents. It is a charming
community with a noteworthy history in the ag-
ricultural development of the Bootheel and of
family values. It is my great pleasure to cele-
brate Oran today on the occasion of its ses-
quicentennial birthday before the U.S. House
of Representatives.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MIDLAND
SHERIFF GARY PAINTER
HON. K. MICHAEL CONAWAY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life of Midland Sheriff Gary
Painter, who was taken from us far too soon.
Sheriff Gary Painter served Midland County
with unconditional dedication for 34 years, and
will be remembered by West Texans as a pa-
triot of integrity and valor.
Sheriff Painter is a native Texan, growing up
a farming community north of Lubbock where
his family planted cotton and grains. After
graduating from Plainview High School, he en-
listed in the United States Marine Corps and
dutifully served his nation through two tours of
duty in Vietnam. His unrelenting dedication to
our country earned him the National Defense
Service Medal, the Vietnam Campaign Medal,
the Vietnam Service Ribbon with 6 devices,
the Presidential Unit Commendation, and the
Vietnam Cross of Gallantry. He was honorably
discharged from the United States Marine
Corps with the rank of Sergeant on August 31,
1970.
Upon his return to Texas, he began his ca-
reer in law enforcement, working for the Texas
Department of Public Safety, Culberson Coun-
ty’s Sheriff’s Office, Presidio County’s Sheriff’s
Office, and the Midland Police Department be-
fore joining the Midland County Sheriff’s Office
in 1982.
Throughout his nine terms as Sheriff of Mid-
land County, Gary dedicated himself to im-
proving the office. He utilized the latest tech-
nologies, helping law enforcement work faster,
smarter, and better. He also notably organized
the first multi–jurisdictional narcotics task force
in West Texas, keeping our community safer.
Sheriff Painter has left behind a huge pair of
boots to fill. His legacy as a courageous, self-
less, public servant will be remembered and
honored by all those he inspired over his dec-
ades of service. Gary has left behind his wife,
Patsy, five children, seven grandchildren, and
four great–grandchildren. God Bless his family
and loved ones during this difficult time of
loss. Suzanne and I will continue to pray as
our community mourns.

RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBU-
TIONS OF JUDY SCHNEIDER ON
THE OCCASION OF HER RETIRE-
MENT
HON. JAMIE RASKIN
OF MARYLAND
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize a distinguished and enormously
popular constituent, Judy Schneider, who is
well-known and beloved to the Members of
this body. After nearly 43 years of devoted
service to the American people, she is retiring
her post as a Specialist on the Congress at
the Congressional Research Service (CRS).
Ms. Schneider began her career as a Con-
gressional Staffer on the Temporary Select
Committee to Study the Senate Committee
System, the House Commission on Adminis-
trative Review, and the Senate Ethics Com-
mittee. Shortly thereafter she joined CRS as a
Congressional Procedures Analyst and then
became Specialist on the Congress. An ad-
mired and respected senior-level expert on the
history, procedures, rules and culture of Con-
gress, she employed her sharp intellect, pro-
digious curiosity and seasoned experience to
the benefit of us all.
Over the course of her career, Ms. Schnei-
der dedicated herself to the always urgent
mission of congressional reform. She contrib-
uted to the Joint Committee on the Organiza-
tion of Congress in 1991, navigated the cre-
ation of the Department of Homeland Security
after 9/11, and provided logistical support to
Members and staff during five separate
changes of party control in the House.
Never content keeping her vast procedural
knowledge to herself, Ms. Schneider devel-
oped new orientation programs for incoming
Senate Chairs, co-authored the Congressional
Deskbook guide to Congress, and advised
Members through hearings, markups, and
committee assignment bids. She also co-
founded a program to train thousands of con-
gressional staffers and conducted professional

trainings at the Brookings Institution. Her
mentorship and scholarship have informed a
generation of congressional employees and I
feel reassured knowing that her institutional in-
fluence will continue long past the date of her
retirement.
Unsurprisingly given the scope and depth of
her achievements, Ms. Schneider has been
decorated with many recognitions. She re-
ceived a Meritorious Service Award and a
Congressional Staff Leadership Award from
the Stennis Center, as well as several awards
from the Congressional Management Founda-
tion and the Women in Government Relations
(WGR) society. WGR even created a fellow-
ship in her name to honor her service to ‘‘the
thousands of women she has mentored, de-
veloped, and trained.’’
After spending her career shaping Congress
into a more effective, procedurally efficient
place, Ms. Schneider now heads to Sea Isle
City, New Jersey, for an extremely well-de-
served retirement. I thank her for her career
and service, and I have been immensely
proud to call her my friend and constituent and
will always consider her so. She has our best
wishes.

HONORING CHANDLER PARK CON-
SERVANCY’S MARSHLAND
PROJECT
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize Chandler Park Conservancy as they
break ground on a marshland conservation
project in Detroit, Michigan.
Michigan is well known for its beautiful lakes
and rivers that are home to diverse wildlife.
But these areas are at risk of being lost as
more areas become developed, especially in
cities like Detroit. Chandler Park Conservancy
is taking steps to preserve those areas and
make spaces habitable for wild plants and ani-
mals to flourish again.
Beyond restoring natural beauty to the area,
the project will provide the added benefit of di-
verting storm water from the city’s already
overburdened sewer system; it will create sus-
tainable rain gardens and house an outdoor
classroom where students can learn more
about conserving and protecting our natural
resources.
Please join me in tribute to the Chandler
Park Conservancy in honor of its marshland
conservation project.

HONORING COLONEL TODD W.
LYONS
HON. JIMMY PANETTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Colonel Todd W. Lyons for his
thirty years of honorable service to our country
and congratulate him on his retirement from
the United States Marine Corps.
Col. Lyons was commissioned as a Second
Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps
in 1989. He graduated with honors from the
Field Artillery Basic and Advanced Courses,
and in 1994 he returned to serve as a Fire
Support Instructor. After his subsequent as-
signment, he was selected to attend the Naval
Postgraduate School where he earned a mas-
ter’s degree in National Security Affairs. Col.
Lyons was selected for duty as a Marine
Attaché in 2000, studying Arabic at the For-
eign Service Institute in Washington, DC. Col.
Lyons then served as an Attaché in Qatar,
Israel, and Oman, where he led strategic plan-
ning teams to further national security objec-
tives.
After his promotion to Lieutenant Colonel in
2005, Col. Lyons was selected to attend the
Israeli National Defense College where he
graduated with honors. In 2008, Col. Lyons
deployed to Iraq as an Engagements Officer
where he was a key figure in coordinating al-
lies to secure the transfer of Anbar Province
back to Iraqi control. In 2014 he returned to
the Defense Attaché Service and served as
the Chief of Operations until 2016, where he
directed operations in crisis regions throughout
the world.
Col. Lyons is currently the Senior Marine
Representative at the Naval Postgraduate
school, where he teaches Innovation Leader-
ship and is widely respected as a professor
and mentor of our next generation of military
leaders. In his role as the Associate Dean of
Research, Col. Lyons employs an interdiscipli-
nary approach by connecting academic re-
searchers with military practitioners.
Col. Lyons’ personal decorations emphasize
his efforts and unwavering dedication to serv-
ing our country. They include the Defense
Meritorious Service Medal with Oak Leaf Clus-
ter, the Navy and Marine Corps Meritorious
Service Medal with gold star, and the Navy
and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with
gold stars. Col. Lyons has received two De-
partment of State Superior Honor Awards for
his esteemed work as an Attaché, one for his
work in Israel during the Israeli withdrawal
from Gaza in 2005 and another for his work in
Oman between 2011 and 2014.
Col. Lyon’s distinguished career of military
service is nothing short of an inspiration, and
his legacy of teaching and leadership will un-
doubtedly live on through our future genera-
tions of service members. He embodies dedi-
cation and service, and the central coast of
California has benefitted greatly from his pres-
ence. I whole-heartedly wish Col. Lyons, his
wife Kristiana and their three daughters,
Grace, Eleanor and Jordan the best during his
retirement. Madam Speaker, I ask that my col-
leagues in the House join me in thanking
Colonel Todd W. Lyons for his honorable serv-
ice to our nation and congratulating him on his
well-deserved retirement.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF DR.
KELLY SCOTT SEGARS, SR.
HON. TRENT KELLY
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to celebrate the life of Dr. Kelly
Scott Segars, Sr., who passed away on Tues-
day, July 23rd at the age of 89.
Dr. Segars, a resident of Iuka, Mississippi,
served his community, state, and nation as a
physician, banker, pilot, farmer, entrepreneur
and humanitarian. He was born on March 11,
1930, in Red Bay, Alabama to Dock and Ora
S. Segars. He was an honor graduate of Red
Bay High School and the Auburn University
School of Pharmacy. Upon completion of his
studies at Auburn, he married his high school
sweetheart, Martha Ann Thompson. He joined
the U.S. Army as a Second Lieutenant and
was promoted to the rank of First Lieutenant
while serving in Korea from 1953 to 1955. He
received many recognitions for his service in-
cluding the American Defense Medal, Korean
Service Medal, United Nations Medal and
Army Commendation Medal.
Following his military service, he pursued
his interest in medicine and graduated from
the University of Mississippi School of Medi-
cine in 1959. In 1982, he established The
Segars Clinic, and it quickly became known as
the State’s most innovative and technically ad-
vanced medical facilities in North Mississippi.
In 1962, Dr. Segars chartered the First Na-
tional Bank of Iuka. Today, First American Na-
tional Bank operates nine branches in six
counties.
Left to cherish his memory is his wife of al-
most 67 years, Martha Thompson Segars; his
sons—Scott Segars and Mark Segars of Iuka,
MS; and his daughter Leigh Ann Segars of
Pensacola, Florida as well as five grand-
children.
Dr. Segars’ life was one of service, love for
his family, and community. He will be greatly
missed by all whom he encountered.

HONORING AVIATION MACHINIST’S
MATE 1ST CLASS GORDON
KINNEY ON HIS 105TH BIRTHDAY
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in recognition of Aviation Machinist’s Mate 1st
Class Gordon Kinney of Chicago, Illinois, who
is celebrating his 105th birthday today. Mr.
Kinney is a veteran who bravely served our
nation in the United States Navy during World
War II.
Mr. Kinney was deployed to Japan during
his three-year tour of duty in World War II,
where he served as a Navy Aircraft Crew
Chief aboard a PBM Mariner aircraft nick-
named ABLE. PBM Mariner flight crews
played a vital role throughout the war, acting
as patrol bombers as well as performing high
priority search and rescue missions for
downed pilots and aircrews. The crew com-
plement consisted of three pilots, two naviga-
tors, and four crew. Mr. Kinney was drawn to
aviation at a young age and knew he wanted
to fly from the time he was only five years old.
Mr. Kinney and each of his three brothers
answered the call of duty and fought to defend
our country during World War II. He and his
brothers were inspired by their family’s long
tradition of service to our country, dating back
to their father and grandfather.
For Mr. Kinney’s heroism and extraordinary
achievement during his military service, he
was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross
as well as the Air Medal. These decorations
exemplify Mr. Kinney’s dedication to the
Navy’s core values of honor, courage, and
commitment, as well as his country.

ASTORIA REGATTA
HON. SUZANNE BONAMICI
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I rise to
congratulate the Astoria Regatta, the City of
Astoria, and Clatsop County on the 125th
celebration of the Regatta. This is a joyous
milestone for one of the oldest festivals west
of the Rocky Mountains and an important mo-
ment to pause and reflect on the significance
of the Regatta to our region.
Since the Astoria Regatta’s founding in
1894, it has celebrated our connection to the
mighty Columbia River and our heritage as a
seafaring and fishing community. The first fes-
tival, which evolved out of the custom of boat
racing on the river, included a parade of 22
decorated yachts and the presence of the U.S.
Monitor Monterey. Early Regattas featured a
four-and-a-half mile swim across the river, and
the popular Salmon Derby. Since then, the
Regatta has grown with the additions of the
Regatta Court, the Grand Land Parade, the
Seaman’s Memorial, the rose planting cere-
mony, and many other special community tra-
ditions.
Today, the Astoria Regatta embodies the
best aspects of our region. Through the Royal
Court, the Regatta helps develop the leader-
ship skills of young women. The Regatta is
also an opportunity to praise the dedication of
community leaders who serve as Regatta Dig-
nitaries: the Admiral, Admiral’s Aide, and the
Grand Marshals. And through the Seaman’s
Memorial, the Regatta allows us to remember
and memorialize those we have lost on the
river and the ocean.
Although World War I and World War II in-
terrupted the celebration of the Astoria Re-
gatta, the community always found a way to
restore it. In fact, many of our long-standing
community institutions have ties to the Re-
gatta: in 1933, the newly-founded Astoria
Yacht Club helped bring the Regatta back
after the First World War, and the Clatsop
County Fair began in 1905 as an agricultural
exhibit of the Regatta. Past Regattas marked
the Lewis and Clark Sesquicentennial Cele-
bration in 1955, the opening of the Astoria-
Megler Bridge in 1966, the U.S. Bicentennial
in 1976, and the Bicentennial of Astoria in
2011.
We can only imagine what E.J. Smith, editor
of The Daily Morning Astorian, and Frank M.
Gunn, secretary of the Astoria Football Club,
would think about the 125th anniversary of the
tradition they started in 1894. Like us, surely
they would be proud of the community that
Astoria has become, the growth and vitality of
this region, and the continuation of this grand
tradition.
SUPPORT FOR H.R. 748
HON. JOE COURTNEY
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I would
like to thank Chairman NEAL for his leadership
managing this bill on the floor. As Chair of the
Ways and Means Committee, his advocacy is
a powerful message to the House to pass the
Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act.
I also want to thank Ranking Member BRADY
and Rep. MIKE KELLY for their bipartisan ef-
forts in support of this bill, defying the polar-
ized politics that far too often dominates the
health care debate.
Madam Speaker, this bill today comes with
the support of a more than 650 health care
stakeholders who, over the last ten years,
have joined together to repeal the 40 percent
excise tax on higher premium health plans
scheduled to go into effect in 2022.
This tax was a late add on to the Affordable
Care Act and has been rattling around in the
federal tax code ever since, never having ac-
tually collected a penny of revenue, but none-
theless casting an statutory shadow over 180
million Americans’ health plans—we know in
real life from HR administrators and employee
representatives it has added pressure to shift
coverage into higher deductible health plans.
As the Commonwealth Fund recently reported,
the numbers of Americans who are under-
insured as the result of high deductibles has
grown by over 50 percent since 2005. Kaiser
Family Foundation just reported that 31 per-
cent of employer health plans will get hit by
the tax in 2022, and that number will grow
sharply soon after. Passage of this bill will
stop that trend from worsening, lift the shadow
that overhangs employer-sponsored plans,
and give millions of teachers, factory workers,
small businesses, firefighters and the like, re-
lief.
As the bill’s lead sponsor, I want to foot
stomp the fact that repeal of the tax does not
touch the architecture of the ACA’s patient
protections. Repeal is completely severable
from the other 440 sections of the law and
leaves intact essential health benefits, and the
elimination of preexisting conditions exclusions
and lifetime caps to name a few. Given that
those patient protections have been in full op-
eration for the last ten years, while this ‘‘zom-
bie tax’’ has been in a coma during that time,
it is abundantly clear that the tax is discon-
nected from the rest of the law. Lastly, I want
to underscore the CBO determination that
passage will not result in any increase in the
number of uninsured.
There is one other concern that observers
have raised, namely the impact on the na-
tional debt. Again, JCT has given a mixed re-
port. The good news is that repeal this year
2019 will result in no budget impact in 2020
and 2021. In the following two years they esti-
mate a loss of 21 billion in tax revenue. In the
out years their projections grow exponentially,
based on a theory of ‘‘wage effect’’ cause by
the ‘‘thinning’’ of health plans’ value and a cor-
responding increase in wages. To say that the
‘‘wage effect’’ theory is debatable is an under-
statement, and employee groups such as
Wage Works, the AFL–CIO, police and fire-
fighter groups ferociously deny the validity of
the ‘‘wage effect’’ based on their real life expe-
rience at the collective bargaining table.
The only remaining question a reasonable
observer might ask is why has repeal taken so
long? Given the initial 5-year delay in the tax’s
effective date in 2010, based on Speaker
Nancy Pelosi’s opposition and the two subse-
quent delays until 2022, it is true that the
warning flags were up on this tax early and
Congress should have acted sooner. In the
Congresses that followed 2010 ACA enact-
ment, there was ample opportunity to get this
done. In the 114th Congress an identical sur-
gical repeal bill had 188 bipartisan cospon-
sors. In the 115th Congress a surgical bill had
304 bipartisan cosponsors. Despite that broad
based support, neither Speaker John Boehner
nor Paul Ryan ever called those bills up for a
vote. I know because I was the lead Demo-
cratic sponsor on every one of those meas-
ures.
Madam Speaker, with 370 House cospon-
sors, I am hopeful an overwhelming tally to-
night will send a laser-like message to the
Senate to adopt this bill as soon as possible,
as is.

USROWING NATIONAL CHAM-

HON. JACK BERGMAN

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it’s my
honor to recognize Lila Miller and Elizabeth
Saunders for their success in the 2019
USRowing National Championships. Through
their perseverance and determination, Lila and
Elizabeth have distinguished themselves as
athletes and representatives of their commu-
nity and Michigan’s First District.
Although Lila is blind, she has learned to
row over the past several years as a member
of the Lake Leelanau Rowing Club. Together,
she and Elizabeth have developed a passion
for the sport—and rowing together at the US-
Rowing National Championships, they brought
home gold medals for the club. With rowers
varying in age from 12 to the mid-80’s, the
Lake Leelanau Rowing Club is a 501(c)(3)
charitable organization dedicated to promoting
access to rowing for Michiganders of all ages
and experience levels. They host national
sculling clinics, rowing camps, and year-round
programs for local youth and adults, including
for those with visual impairments. These pro-
grams are held on the grounds and lakefront
at Fountain Point Resort, Michigan’s oldest
waterfront resort and a National Historic Site.
Fountain Point and Lake Leelanau offer the
ideal location for cultivating a love of rowing,
offering 17 miles of pristine water for rowers
like Lila and Elizabeth to practice the sport.
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to congratu-
late Lila Miller and Elizabeth Saunders for
their success in the 2019 USRowing National
Championships. Michiganders can take great
pride in knowing the First District is home to
such exceptional individuals. On behalf of my
constituents, I wish Elizabeth and Lila all the
best in their future endeavors.

HONORING CHP OFFICER ROGER
GORE
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life and sacrifice of California High-
way Patrol Officer Roger Davis Gore. On April
5, 1970, Officer Gore was one of four CHP of-
ficers tragically gunned down in a police
shooting near Interstate 5. In remembrance of
his sacrifice, a section of State Highway 99 in
Merced is being dedicated to him and his col-
league, Officer Walter Frago.
Born on February 17, 1947 to Max Gore
and Bertha M. Staley, Officer Gore was the
second born in his family of three in the
Merced County town of Snelling, California.
He graduated from Merced High School and
later attended Merced College before becom-
ing a CHP officer in 1967. Together, he and
his wife Valerie were the parents of one
daughter, Elyce.
On April 5, 1970, Officers Frago and Gore
were the first to respond to a suspect who had
been reported brandishing a weapon. Upon
pulling over a vehicle with two men, a gun
fight ensued leaving Officers Frago and Gore,
as well as Officers George Aleyn and James
Pence dead. This tragedy is one still remem-
bered by the law enforcement community and
Merced County residents as Officers Frago
and Gore were both born and raised in
Merced.
In honor of Officer Gore’s commitment to
duty and sacrifice, the section of Highway 99
between Mission Avenue and Campus Park-
way is being dedicated as the CHP Officers
Walter Frago and Roger Gore Memorial Free-
way. This location is fitting, as Campus Park-
way will eventually connect Highway 99 to the
University of California, Merced campus. This
section of highway being dedicated will con-
tinue to ensure our local community and future
generations remember and honor the sacrifice
of these two young officers, each of whom lost
their lives at 23-years-old on that tragic day.
The CHP Officers Walter Frago and Roger
Gore Memorial Freeway symbolizes the sac-
rifice these two gentlemen gave for all citizens
to help continue building a better future for our
community and country. Furthermore, it will
help bridge Merced County’s past to its
present and remind community members of
the dedication to duty exhibited by these two
fine officers.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in honoring the duty and sacrifice of
CHP Officer Roger Gore. It is both fitting and
appropriate that we honor him as the CHP Of-
ficers Walter Frago and Roger Gore Memorial
Freeway is dedicated. I wish his family, the
California Highway Patrol, and the Merced law
enforcement community the best as this sec-
tion of Highway 99 is dedicated in his honor.

HON. CHRIS PAPPAS
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Tappan Chairs of Sandwich as
they celebrate their bicentennial. First opened
in 1819 by Abraham Tappan, Tappan Chairs
has become a pillar in the Sandwich commu-
nity.
This business stayed in the Tappan family
for over a hundred years through the work of
the founder’s son, Daniel, and grandsons,
Walter and Winthrop. Although it has changed
owners since those early days, the style and
durability of Tappan Chairs has remained, and
they are still produced on the same vintage
equipment that they were crafted on so many
generations ago.
The success and longevity of Tappan
Chairs is a testament to the enduring work
ethic of its owners, who for generation after
generation, stepped in to take its mantel. On
behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire’s
First Congressional District, I congratulate ev-
eryone at Tappan Chairs on an exciting anni-
versary. I hope that they are able to celebrate
this impressive milestone and wish them the
best of luck in their next 200 years of busi-
ness! I thank them for all that they do to make
the Granite State such a wonderful place to

INTRODUCTION OF THE ALLOWING
BODY CAMERAS IN JOINT TASK
FORCES ACT OF 2019
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today,
Representative DONALD S. BEYER, Jr. and I in-
troduce the Allowing Body Cameras in Joint
Task Forces Act of 2019. This bill would pro-
hibit the federal government from refusing to
work with local police departments that require
their officers to wear body cameras. Our bill
would apply to all federal agencies.
Under current policy, though it appears to
be unwritten, the Department of Justice has
been refusing to participate in task forces with
local police departments that have body cam-
era requirements.
The Justice Department has determined that
47 percent of police departments in the coun-
try have body cameras. It is beyond reason to
prevent these numerous police agencies from
participating in federal task forces if their offi-
cers wear body cameras. The federal govern-
ment should be encouraging the use of officer
body cameras instead of discouraging their
use. This bill only applies to uniformed offi-
cers, which means federal officials could
refuse to participate in task forces if body
cameras are used during undercover oper-
ations.
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion.

HUMANITARIAN STANDARDS FOR

ACT
SPEECH OF
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM
OF MINNESOTA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 24, 2019
The House in Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union had under
consideration the bill (H.R. 3239) to require
U.S. Customs and Border Protection to per-
form an initial health screening on detain-
ees, and for other purposes:
Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong
support of H.R. 3239, the Humanitarian Stand-
ards for Individuals in Customs and Border
Protection Custody Act.
Having visited federal immigration detention
facilities along the U.S.-Mexico border, I have
seen firsthand the alarming conditions im-
posed on many immigrant refugees by the
Trump administration. There is no question
that we have a humanitarian crisis on our bor-
der. It is also clear that the immigrant deten-
tion system operated by U.S. Customs and
Border Protection (CBP) needs significant re-
form and passing H.R. 3239 is the first step in
the process of improving this distressing situa-
tion.
H.R. 3239 would finally establish a basic
standard of care for immigrants in CBP cus-
tody, including clearly defining the require-
ments for sanitation, nutrition, and hygiene in
CBP detention facilities. The legislation would
also ensure health screenings by medical pro-
fessionals for every immigrant in CBP custody.
I would note that this legislation was written
with the input of CBP Officers who both under-
stand the scope of the humanitarian crisis and
the changes that need to be made in order to
ensure that immigrants in CBP custody get the
necessary medical care they may require.
With regards to the Republican Motion to
Recommit on H.R. 3239, I am unable to sup-
port it because Congress still requires an-
swers from CBP officials on why Members of
Congress and immigrants were targeted in a
derogatory Facebook group run by current and
former CBP employees. However, I would like
to strongly state that I will always stand in
support of our federal employees who follow
their oath of office. Many employees at CBP
put their safety at risk on a daily basis, con-
duct themselves with integrity, and they should
be supported.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support
H.R. 3239.

IN HONOR OF ROY BATES
HON. ANDY BARR
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life of a special man, Roy Bates, of
Winchester, Kentucky. Mr. Bates, a true pa-
triot, passed away on July 4, 2019.
Roy Bates was quite eager to serve his
country and attempted unsuccessfully to enlist
in the Navy and in the Army when he was not
yet of legal age. In 1950, when he was 18
years old, he enlisted in the Marine Corps and
went to Parris Island for training. He was as-
signed to Company C, 1st Battalion, 7th Regi-
ment, 1st Division. He was soon sent to Korea
to join his fellow Marines.
On September 1, 1951, just 3 days before
his 19th birthday, Mr. Bates was on patrol
when his group was ambushed. They were
taking heavy fire. Crawling on his belly trying
to reach cover, he heard the dreaded click of
a landmine beneath him. His left leg was
blown away and his right leg sustained numer-
ous wounds. Severely wounded, he was car-
ried off the field by two fellow Marines. One of
those who carried him off was killed in action
a few days later. Many years later Mr. Bates
was reunited with Royce Henry, the other Ma-
rine who saved him.
Mr. Bates spent 7 years in and out of hos-
pitals and had 32 surgeries. He received a
Purple Heart as well as numerous other med-
als. He married his wife Betty and they had 4
children. Mr. Bates eventually returned home
to Winchester where he always cherished a
deep love for his country and for the Marine
Corps. He was a well respected member of
his community who exemplified good char-
acter and a positive attitude all of his life.
Mr. Bates and his fellow veterans are true
heroes. He willingly served to protect and de-
fend the freedoms that we enjoy today. He
faced life with an unwavering faith in God and
love for this country. I am humbled to honor
the life of Mr. Roy Bates before the United
States Congress.

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam
Speaker, this past weekend of the 50th anni-
versary of the U.S. Landing on the Moon, I
was grateful to join with Chairman ALBIO SIRES
of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the
Western Hemisphere to participate in a bipar-
tisan delegation to Argentina and Chile. Addi-
tional members were TED DEUTCH, TOM
GRAVES, TED YOHO, and NORMA TORRES.
The initial purpose of the CODEL was to at-
tend the Remembrance Ceremony commemo-
rating the 25th Anniversary of the terrorist
bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual As-
sociation (AMIA) Jewish Community Center.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo provided a
heartfelt tribute for the 85 victims viciously
murdered by cowardly perpetrators traced to
the terrorists of Hezbollah financed by the Ira-
nian regime. AMIA President Ariel Eichbaum
welcomed diplomats from across South Amer-
ica.
We also visited the memorial park at the
site of the Israeli Embassy which was bombed
in 1992 murdering 29 victims who were largely
Argentinian citizens who were tragically simply
walking in the neighborhood.
Due to the respect of Chairman SIRES, the
delegation was welcomed to the office of
President Mauricio Macri. It was impressive to
meet with such a public servant who so clearly
loves and appreciates the people he serves of
Argentina.
U.S. Ambassador Eduard Prado and his
wife Maria hosted our visit to the historic Am-
bassador’s residence where we met the cou-
rageous Ambassador from Venezuela Elisa
Trotta Gamus. Ambassador Gamus has been
appointed by the legitimate government of
Venezuela led by Interim-President Juan
Guaido opposed to the dictatorship of the dis-
graced Nicolas Madura who has plundered the
formerly wealthy nation of Venezuela stealing
from its impoverished citizens.
In Santiago, Chile, a very professional coun-
try team briefing was provided at the Embassy
confirming Chile as a very dynamic democracy
with extraordinary economic success as a
model of free market benefits of reducing pov-
erty. The professionalism of the military of
Chile was presented as they are partnered
with the Texas National Guard. Charge d’Af-
faires Baxter Hunt has an enthusiastic staff.
The U.S. Chile lnterparliamentary Friendship
Group of the Chamber of Deputies led by
Chamber President Ivan Flores Garcia hosted
a meeting with Chilean parliamentarians of dif-
ferent parties who all were clear in their appre-
ciation and respect for America.
U.S. educated, Fulbright Scholar, President
Sebastian Pinera welcomed the delegation to
the Presidential Palace. More traveled than
the delegation, he has visited all 50 U.S.
states. In his current term and his prior service
as President, it is clear his free market suc-
cess has built a modern, vibrant partner of the
United States inspiring democracy in all of
South America.
The talented citizens of Argentina and Chile
can be proud of their achievements with Ar-
gentina having a land mass equal to the U.S.,
east of Mississippi River and narrow Chile at
8,000 miles—three time the length of Cali-
fornia.

IN MEMORY OF DR. EDITH IRBY
JONES
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to the
distinguished life and legacy of Dr. Edith Irby
Jones, who passed away on July 15, 2019.
Dr. Jones was the epitome of a trailblazer.
In 1948, she became the first African Amer-
ican student admitted to the University of Ar-
kansas Medical School—six years before the
Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education
decision. In 1959, Dr. Jones again made his-
tory as the first African American woman resi-
dent at Baylor College of Medicine. Twenty-six
years later, Dr. Jones became the first female
president of the National Medical Association,
an organization that has represented black
physicians since 1895.
For half a century, Dr. Jones committed her-
self to serving marginalized communities in
Houston’s Greater Third Ward area. She often
went beyond the typical duties of a physician
by making house calls and picking up patients
in her van in order to expand services to the
underserved in the community. Along with her
work in Houston, Dr. Jones treated patients,
trained physicians, and founded a clinic in
Haiti. Service and dedication for the less fortu-
nate were integral components of Dr. Jones’s
remarkable career, and we are truly grateful
for the impact she has had on generations of
aspiring African American medical profes-
sionals.
Outside of her medical practice, Dr. Jones
notably worked alongside Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr., as part of the ‘‘Freedom Four,’’ a
group that traveled throughout the segregated
South to encourage people to join the civil
rights movement.
Dr. Jones is survived by her daughter, Myra;
sons, Gary and Keith; and many wonderful
grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
I ask my colleagues to join me in remem-
bering Dr. Jones and her extraordinary con-
tributions to medicine, social justice, and the
Greater Houston community. We thank her
and will miss her dearly.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E990 July 25, 2019
April 5, 1970, Officer Frago was one of four
CHP officers tragically gunned down in a po-
lice shooting near Interstate 5. In remem-
brance of his sacrifice, a section of State
Highway 99 in Merced is being dedicated to
him and his colleague, Officer Roger Gore.
Born on December 22, 1946 to Augustine L.
Frago and Rose M. Piovano, Officer Frago
was the third of seven children in the family.
He graduated from Our Lady of Mercy High
School and later Merced College. In 1965, he
married Nicola B. Dunaway, together they had
two daughters Amorette and Gabriell. In 1968,
he began his career as a CHP officer.
On April 5, 1970, Officers Frago and Gore
were the first to respond to a suspect who had
been reported brandishing a weapon. Upon
pulling over a vehicle with two men, a gun
fight ensued leaving Officers Frago and Gore,
as well as Officers George Aleyn and James
Pence dead. This tragedy is one still remem-
bered by the law enforcement community and
Merced County residents as Officers Frago
and Gore were both born and raised in
Merced.
In honor of Officer Frago’s commitment to
duty and sacrifice, the section of Highway 99
between Mission Avenue and Campus Park-
way is being dedicated as the CHP Officers
Walter Frago and Roger Gore Memorial Free-
way. This location is fitting, as Campus Park-
way will eventually connect Highway 99 to the
University of California, Merced campus. This
section of highway being dedicated will con-
tinue to ensure our local community and future
generations remember and honor the sacrifice
of these two young officers, each of whom lost
their lives at 23-years-old on that tragic day.
The CHP Officers Walter Frago and Roger
Gore Memorial Freeway symbolizes the sac-
rifice these two gentlemen gave for all citizens
to help continue building a better future for our
community and country. Furthermore, it will
help bridge Merced County’s past to its
present and remind community members of
the dedication to duty exhibited by these two
fine officers.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in honoring the duty and sacrifice of
CHP Officer Walter Frago. It is both fitting and
appropriate that we honor him as the CHP Of-
ficers Walter Frago and Roger Gore Memorial
Freeway is dedicated. I wish his family, the
California Highway Patrol, and the Merced law
enforcement community the best as this sec-
tion of Highway 99 is dedicated in his honor.

INTRODUCTION OF THE
BIKESHARE TRANSIT ACT OF 2019
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker,
America is in the middle of a micromobility
revolution, with bikeshare and scooters chang-
ing the way that people get around. First intro-
duced in the United States in 2010, more than
100 communities now have bikeshare sys-
tems, supporting a network of more than
100,000 bikes. Since bikeshare’s launch in the
United States, riders have taken more than
100 million trips, with the number of trips and
systems increasing each year.
My community recently celebrated the third
anniversary of its BIKETOWN bikeshare
launch. Since then, Portlanders and visitors
have taken nearly 900,000 trips, covering
more than one million miles and removing un-
told numbers of automobiles from city streets.
The system’s success has already led to its
expansion, giving more communities access to
efficient, carbon-free transportation.
The increased commercial investment
around bikeshare stations and networks is
driving economic development across the
country. Systems are opening in communities
of all sizes from Los Angeles and Cleveland to
Topeka and Birmingham. While some existing
bikeshare programs received federal dollars to
develop their systems, the lack of an estab-
lished funding source has proved an impedi-
ment to many other projects. Since the term
‘‘bikeshare’’ is not defined in U.S. code or de-
scribed by law as a form of transit, existing
bikeshare systems and departments of trans-
portation are forced to operate in a gray area,
creating challenges for funding, maintaining,
and administering these programs.
Today, I am reintroducing the Bikeshare
Transit Act of 2019, legislation that will elimi-
nate this gray area by defining bikeshare in
statute and making bikeshare systems eligible
to receive funding to enhance related public
transportation service or transit facilities. The
bill allows federal funding to be used for ac-
quiring or replacing bikeshare-related equip-
ment and constructing bikeshare facilities.
Bikeshare systems will also be listed as eligi-
ble projects under the Congestion Mitigation
and Air Quality (CMAQ) Improvement Pro-
gram.
The Bikeshare Transit Act will remove sig-
nificant barriers facing new and existing
bikeshare projects applying for federal funding
while underscoring that bikeshare programs
drive economic development and add value to
America’s transportation system.

IN RECOGNITION OF BRAVO COM-
PANY, NEW BATTALION’S SERV-
ICE IN BROWN COUNTY, WIS-
CONSIN
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the hard work, dedication,
and outstanding service of Bravo Company,
NEW Battalion in helping veterans in Brown
County, Wisconsin.
In 2017, the citizens of Brown County were
asked to create a new program to help vet-
erans in Northeast Wisconsin transition from
active duty to civilian life. As a result, a group
of hardworking veterans and citizens formed
Bravo Company, NEW Battalion, a non-profit
veteran-to-veteran sponsorship organization.
The veteran sponsorship program increases
veterans’ awareness of the educational, state,
and federal benefits, as well as community re-
sources that are available to them upon re-
turning home from active duty.
Earlier this year, the first set of veteran-to-
veteran sponsors completed training, receiving
education on the many veteran service organi-
zations and resources available to veterans
and their families in Northeast Wisconsin.
After training, each sponsor is partnered with
a recently discharged veteran to support the
veteran through the transition phase and con-
nect him or her to support services in the
area, like the County Veteran Service Office.
Since its creation, Bravo Company, NEW
Battalion has already helped veterans in
Northeast Wisconsin navigate and return to ci-
vilian life. I am confident the organization will
continue to help many more returning veterans
as its ranks grow.
The commitment to excellence, dedication
and service that Elaina Koltz, Scott Katzka,
Ken Corry, Dick Marbes, and Patrick Fauldes
have shown is integral to the success of vet-
erans transitioning to civilian life in Brown
County. These founding board members of
Bravo Company, NEW Battalion insure that
veterans receive a warm welcome from active
duty or deployment back home to Brown
County. They truly demonstrate selfless serv-
ice and are an asset to this community.
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this
body to join me in applauding Bravo Com-
pany, NEW Battalion, its board, and its vet-
eran volunteer sponsors for their service to
discharged veterans in Northeast Wisconsin. I
am proud to have such an organization in my
district, one which consists of many veterans
whose service continues even after they re-
move their uniform.

COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION
ACT OF 2019
SPEECH OF
HON. ELIJAH E. CUMMINGS
OF MARYLAND
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 24, 2019
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank you
as well as Chairman MALONEY, Ranking Mem-
ber GRAVES, and Ranking Member GIBBS, for
your leadership.
I rise in support of H.R. 3409, and applaud
the inclusion of Title VIII, the Coast Guard
Academy Improvement Act.
I have been honored to work closely with
Chairman DEFAZIO and Chairman BENNIE
THOMPSON, the Chairman of the Homeland
Security Committee, as well as with Congress-
man JOE COURTNEY, to address the troubling
issues that have arisen at the Coast Guard
Academy.
As Chairman of the Coast Guard Sub-
committee from 2007 through 2010, I con-
vened a series of hearings to push the Acad-
emy to ensure that its cadet corps reflects the
diversity of the nation it is being prepared to
serve. And progress has been made.
However, the recent Equity Scorecard eval-
uation has found profoundly troubling trends at
the Academy.
Specifically, the review found that, ‘‘Black/
African/American cadets have been consist-
ently less likely to graduate than the all-cadet
average’’ and, ‘‘Of particular urgency is Black/
African-American cadets’ disproportionately
high share of disciplinary sanctions.’’
Then, in December 2018, the Inspector
General of the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity issued a report finding that a Lieutenant
Commander on the faculty of the Academy,
‘‘was retaliated against on the basis of her
complaints, in violation of the Military Whistle-
blower Protection Act.’’
Chairman THOMPSON, Congressman COURT-
NEY, and I are continuing to conduct oversight

of the Academy’s response to the Equity
Scorecard findings, and we are investigating
numerous disparities and shortcomings in how
the Academy handles allegations of harass-
ment and bullying.
However, one thing is already abundantly
clear: Business as usual is simply not an op-
tion.
For that reason, in June, I was honored to
join Chairman THOMPSON in introducing H.R.
3488, the Coast Guard Academy Improvement
Act.
I appreciate the thoughtful revisions that
have been made to that bill’s text through
close collaboration with the Transportation
Committee and I thank Chairman DEFAZIO for
including those revisions in the Coast Guard
Authorization Act before us.
These provisions will require urgently need-
ed assessments of and improvements in the
Academy’s outreach processes and institu-
tional structures to foster expanded diversity.
I urge all Members to vote in favor of the
Coast Guard Authorization Act.

COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF AMERICAN LEGION
POST 39 OF NORTH SAINT PAUL,
MINNESOTA
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM
OF MINNESOTA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate the 100th Anniversary
of American Legion Post 39 of North Saint
Paul, Minnesota.
Shortly after the end of World War I, 15 vet-
erans living around the village of North Saint
Paul came together to discuss a new national
organization called the American Legion that
was dedicated to serving veterans and their
families. These veterans decided to seek a
charter for a local post, which was issued on
August 1, 1919, beginning a century of service
and support for Minnesota veterans, their fam-
ilies and the greater good of the surrounding
North Saint Paul community.
The newly formed American Legion Post 39
quickly found its focus serving the community
by leading a Safety First Committee which
worked with businesses to improve safety
around crossing guards and signals at rail and
street crossings. To honor and support their
fellow veterans, another part of their mission
was to support the Minneapolis and Hastings
Veterans Homes, the Veterans Rest Camp
and the Fort Snelling Rifle Squad. The post
also made investments in America’s future by
sponsoring Boy’s State, Legionville school pa-
trol camp and providing college scholarships
for local students, as well as their American
Legion Baseball team the 39ers.
Spouses, daughters and granddaughters of
Post 39 have always been integral to the suc-
cess of its work. Post 39 Auxiliary was for-
mally chartered in May 1926 to work alongside
the post and expand its community contribu-
tions, including support of Girls’ State and
Webster Elementary School. The auxiliary has
also assisted important entities like the Min-
nesota Assistance Council for Veterans and
the Veterans Administration Community Re-
source and Referral Center. The auxiliary has
played a vital role in the success of the Post.
As a life member of the Post 39 Auxiliary, I
know firsthand the many contributions that the
post makes to our veterans, our state and our
nation.
The sons and grandsons of veterans who
comprise Squadron 39—Sons of the American
Legion have supported among many programs
the North St Paul Food Shelf, American Le-
gion Baseball, the Silver Lake Splash and the
Shop, Ship and Share program.
Just last year, Post 39 was a key supporter
of the American Legion National Convention,
held in Minneapolis—which marked the start
of the 100th anniversary of the national orga-
nization. Through its support of the work and
advocacy of the American Legion, Department
of Minnesota as well as the National Organi-
zation, the North Saint Paul Post 39 epito-
mizes the Four Pillars of the American Le-
gion—Veterans Affairs and Rehabilitation, Na-
tional Security, Americanism, and Children
and Youth.
Madam Speaker, as veterans, families and
members of the area communities gather on
August 3, 2019 to celebrate the 100th Anni-
versary of the founding of American Legion
Post 39 of North Saint Paul, Minnesota please
join me in honoring this major milestone and
the generations of leaders and members of
this veterans service organization.

RECOGNIZING MARTIN PURYEAR
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in recognizing the achievements of Martin
Puryear.
Martin Puryear, the eldest of seven children,
was born in Washington, DC. He was raised
in Southwest Washington and attended the
then-segregated William Syphax Elementary
School. His lifelong interest in the natural
world and how things are constructed inspired
a young Puryear to visit local institutions such
as the National Zoo, the Museum of Science
and Technology and the Museum of Natural
History. The city’s art museums left a profound
impact on Puryear, and today some of those
same museums—the National Gallery of Art,
the Smithsonian American Art Museum and
the Hirshhorn Museum—hold some of his
most significant works in their permanent col-
lections.
After graduating from the Catholic University
of America, Puryear spent two years in Sierra
Leone teaching English, French and biology
as a member of the Peace Corps. He contin-
ued his studies at the Swedish Royal Acad-
emy of Art in Stockholm and received his MFA
from Yale University.
Puryear’s approach to object-making has
been influenced by the indigenous techniques
and materials of cultures he has encountered
on his travels. His sculptures are painstakingly
constructed from materials such as wood,
metal and stone. Their elegant, abstract forms
reflect his deep interest in history.
Puryear received a MacArthur Foundation
award in 1989 and the National Medal of Arts
from President Obama in 2011. This year, he
is representing the United States at the 58th
Venice Biennale. The Museum of Modern Art
in New York and the Art Institute of Chicago
have organized major retrospectives, and his
work has been acquired by museums across
the United States, Europe and Asia.
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in recognizing Martin
Puryear for his outstanding accomplishments
as an artist and honored DC native.

COMMEMORATING THE SEVENTY-
FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF
LECHASE CONSTRUCTION
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to
commemorate the seventy-fifth anniversary of
LeChase Construction.
Established in 1944 by Raymond F.
LeChase, LeChase Construction is a full-serv-
ice construction management and general
construction firm. With humble beginnings,
LeChase Construction began as a small family
operation to fill the local demand for construc-
tion work during World War II. Today LeChase
employs more than seven hundred and fifty
employees and ranks among the nation’s top
contractors.
LeChase prides itself of offering the capa-
bilities of a large firm while maintaining the
personalized service of a small firm. For the
last twenty years, LeChase’s Southern Tier
operations, headquartered in Corning, New
York, has provided people from the region
with the expertise and high quality of service
that LeChase is known for. From Chautauqua
to Elmira and down to central Pennsylvania,
LeChase has earned the respect of repeat cli-
ents, who account for nearly ninety percent of
the region’s work. Vice President Fred Thomp-
son credits that earned respect to their track
record of delivering successful projects and
the hardworking, down-to-earth people of the
Southern Tier.
Seventy-five years of serving the community
is certainly a cause for celebration. I congratu-
late LeChase on this impressive milestone and
look forward to their continued success in the
years to come.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
commemorate the seventy-fifth anniversary of
LeChase Construction.

Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I recog-

Neely, Principal of Cypress Bay High School
in my hometown of Weston, Florida.
Scott Neely is one of Broward County’s
longest-serving high school principals. He was
the founding principal and served at the helm
of Cypress Bay, Florida’s largest high school,
since it opened in 2002 and shepherded thou-
sands of students—including my three chil-
dren—through some of the most formidable
years of their lives.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E992 July 25, 2019
Principal Neely built Cypress Bay into one
of the highest ranked public high schools in
the nation. They have an almost perfect grad-
uation rate, 72 percent of students take at
least one Advance Placement course, and 90
percent pursue studies in college or vocational
schools. Beyond academics, Principal Neely
and Cypress Bay High have instilled a sense
of service in their students. In recent years,
the student body has raised over $250,000 for
UNICEF. Scott has also fostered a learning
environment that values diversity and inspires
all students to succeed. Indeed, Cypress Bay
reflects the beautiful diversity of my home
state, with a student body that is more than 50
percent Hispanic.
Scott’s devotion to his students is a re-
minder that we must continue to invest in our
nation’s teachers, children, and schools. And
Principal Neely has always understood that in
order to invest in our students, we need to in-
vest in our teachers. He is truly an educator’s
educator. Educators will tell you that teaching
is demanding. Educators work long hours and
are not only expected to impart a certain
knowledge, but they also instill a love of learn-
ing in their students.
I know firsthand the excellence Scott has
brought to Cypress Bay each day. His pa-
tience, wisdom, and encouragement have
helped shape tomorrow’s leaders, ensuring
America remains competitive, innovative, and
prosperous.
Scott is a champion for our children and an
inspiration to all those who know him, myself
included. I join my fellow Cypress Bay Lighting
parents, students, and alumni in wishing the
‘‘Big Kahuna’’ well on his retirement and in
thanking him for the thoughtful and committed
work he has done to enrich and safeguard our
children.

HONORING THE FALLEN COMBAT
VETERANS FROM LAKE HAVASU
CITY, ARIZONA
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in honor of six brave men from Lake Havasu
City, Arizona who made the ultimate sacrifice
in defense of our great country. The men and
women of the United States Military place
themselves in danger every day to afford us
the freedoms and the way of life that we are
privileged to have.
SSG. Carl Hammer, SPC. Dylan Thomas,
SPC. Anthony Sausto, SPC. Patrick Tinnell,
SP4 Scott Broadston and SPC. Carey ‘‘Gary’’
Harmon dedicated their lives to these shared
ideals that make the United States a country
unlike any other. While no words or actions
can ever repay the valor and service of these
men, we commemorate their sacrifice with my
legislation, H.R. 3314, which will rename the
U.S. Post Office located at 1750 McCulloch
Boulevard North in Lake Havasu City, Arizona,
as the ‘‘Lake Havasu City Combat Veterans
Memorial Post Office Building.’’ I thank the
House Oversight and Reform Committee for
passing this bill today through committee and
I wholeheartedly urge this body to adopt this
legislation.
Madam Speaker, I would also like to include
in the RECORD the biographies of the six men
that the Lake Havasu City Combat Veterans
Memorial Post Office Building honors. May we
never forget the legacy that they leave behind
for future generations of Americans.
Carl Erik Hammar (Aug. 3, 1986–Jul. 14,
2012). Carl Hammar lived in Lake Havasu City
shortly before his deployment overseas. Born
in Sweden, he moved to the United States
and Lake Havasu City during his senior year
of high school, where SSG. Hammar married
fellow student Abby Mahan in 2005. Together
they had one child, and Hammar enlisted in
the Army after spending a year at Mohave
Community College. Hammar actually served
twice in Iraq and in Afghanistan. On July 14,
2012 he died due to wounds caused by small-
arms fire in Musa Kheyl district, Khost prov-
ince, Afghanistan.
Dylan Thomas Reid (Sept. 3, 1986–Oct. 16,
2010) Spc. Dylan Thomas Reid, 24, of Lamar,
Mo., died Oct. 16 in Amarah, Iraq, where he
was stationed. He was assigned to the 1st
Battalion, 8th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade
Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, Fort Car-
son, Colo. Dylan was born Sept. 3, 1986, in
Ironwood, Mich., to Terry and Kelli Reid. He
graduated in 2005 from Desert Technology
High School, Lake Havasu City. Dylan has
proudly served his country since joining the
United State Army in 2008. Dylan is survived
by his daughter, Avery Lynn Reid, born Sept.
14, 2010, in Minnesota.
Anthony Jonathan Sausto (Dec. 10, 1985–
May 10, 2007) Anthony Sausto lived in Lake
Havasu City for a few months before his de-
ployment to Iraq, but friends and family say
that those few months were the happiest they
had ever seen him. Born in New Jersey, Spc.
Sausto moved to Lake Havasu City after get-
ting his GED and planned to go into legal
services with the military after he returned
from his tour of duty. Anthony originally grew
up in Atlantic City, New Jersey but moved to
Lake Havasu City in 2005 with his mother and
his sister. He was the youngest of three sib-
lings. Family members said he was a shy,
quiet youth, once in an army uniform, Anthony
found his calling, and his manhood. He came
out of his shell, he was so outgoing and con-
fident. He also had a compassionate side. He
was a great man with a big heart who saw the
brighter side of life. Anthony died on May 10,
2007 in Baghdad, Iraq from wounds suffered
by small firearms.
Pattick Allan Tinnell (Mar. 25, 1981–Apr. 19,
2006) Spc. Tinnell was the first from Lake
Havasu City to be killed in action during the
Global War on Terror, and the impact it had
on the community has been obvious and last-
ing. Tinnell’s passing inspired the town to
come together in support of his family to build
the Tinnell Memorial Sports Park, a skate park
with a feature designed like Tinnell’s helmet.
Opened in 2013, the park is now the largest
multi-use skate park in Arizona and the South-
west. Patrick was originally born in Los Ange-
les, California but grew up in Lake Havasu
City, Arizona. In between High School and
Military he worked for pest control and was a
BMX rider for MBK bikes. Tinnell also volun-
teered at Teen Break, trying to set good ex-
amples for students. As a side note, Patrick
was the first person to jump over an elephant
during Teen Break in 1999. He joined the
army in September 2005. On April 19, 2006,
Patrick Tinnell died in Siniyah, Iraq.
Scott Ray Broadston (Nov. 3, 1950–Jun. 5,
1970) Scott was born in San Diego, California
and later moved to Arizona. He spent most of
his life in Tucson as well as Lake Havasu City.
He graduated from Tucson High School in
1968. Broadston enlisted in the Army and en-
tered via ‘‘Regular Military.’’ He began his tour
on October 7, 1969. In Vietnam, Broadston
flew a UH–1H helicopter and on the day he
died, he was tasked with supporting a combat

of the town of An Nonh. He died June 5,
1970. There is a memorial park in Lake
Havasu City dedicated to him called the ‘‘Lake
Havasu Memorial Gardens.’’
Carey ‘‘Gary’’ Dean Harmon (Jul. 26, 1948–
Apr. 26, 1968) SPC Carey Dean Harmon be-
came the first soldier from Lake Havasu City
to be Killed in Action in Vietnam, as a result
of multiple fragmentation wounds at the age of
19, on April 26, 1968. Harmon was attached
to the 26th Infantry Regiment, nicknamed The
Blue Spaders. He was in Vietnam for three
months and his unit was in the Binh Duong
province of South Vietnam at the time he was
killed. It is possible that he fought against the
TET Offensive. During his first month in Viet-
nam. Hatmon’s then girlfriend, Mary Fraze-
DeWees who now lives in Prescott, knew him
as Gary Harmon. She said she wanted to
marry Harmon, but at 16, her father did not
approve.

died in service to his country during the Ko-
rean War in November 1950. I ask that you
join with me and the people of Michigan’s First
District in honoring the heroic sacrifices of our
service men and women as his remains are
returned to his home in Michigan after nearly
70 years.
In Korea, Charles served as a member of
Company M, 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regi-
ment, 1st Cavalry Division. He was reported
Missing in Action on November 2nd, after his
unit was attacked by enemy forces near
Unsan, North Korea. His remains could not be
recovered following the attack, and he was not
reported as a prisoner of war. On December
31, 1953, the U.S. Army declared him as de-
ceased. On July 27, 2018, Cpl. Lawler’s re-
mains were turned over to the United States
along with many of his fellow servicemen fol-
lowing the summit between President Donald
Trump and Kim Jong-un. The remains were
given to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting
Agency, which works to identify fallen service
members and return them to their families. On
May 13, 2019, his remains were finally identi-
fied.
Cpl. Lawler’s name is recorded on the
Courts of the Missing at the National Memorial
Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, along
with the others who are missing from the Ko-
rean War. A rosette will be placed next to his
name to indicate he has been accounted for.
Charles will arrive in Traverse City later today
before finally being laid to rest on July 27th.
His remains will be escorted by a full Honor
Guard and rifle squad, as well as by Veterans
from across the country.
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize
Corporal Charles S. Lawler for making the ulti-
mate sacrifice in defense of his country. On
behalf of Michigan’s First Congressional Dis-
trict, I ask you to join with me in honoring an
American hero as he returns home.

RECOGNIZING ROCK FALLS
UNITED METHODIST CHURCH ON
THEIR 150TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the 150th anniversary of Rock
Falls United Methodist Church as they honor
August 6, 2019 as ‘‘Rock Falls United Meth-
odist Church Day’’ in the city. On this occa-
sion, I extend my immense gratitude to Rev-
erend Dr. Solomon Sudhaker, the proud lead-
er of this congregation.
Rock Falls United Methodist Church has
grown tremendously since its origins in 1869
as the first church in the City of Rock Falls.
Since then, it has become an integral part of
the city of Rock Falls. In the last 150 years,
the church has undergone many trans-
formations—from sharing the wisdom of sev-
eral different Pastors through the years, to ris-
ing from the ashes of a 1922 fire, to the addi-
tion of the Education Wing in 1961. The
church has prospered and has always re-
mained true to its core mission and values.
Rock Falls United Methodist Church has gone
above and beyond to enrich our community
through their commitment to education, youth
and faith.
Madam Speaker, I would once again like to
congratulate Rock Falls United Methodist
Church on their 150th anniversary. I am proud
to know that organizations, such as Rock Falls
United Methodist Church, continue to flourish
and strengthen our community.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH
YEAR OF BOY SCOUT TROOP 2
OF APPLETON, WISCONSIN’S
CHARTER
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Boy Scout Troop 2 of Appleton,
Wisconsin as they celebrate the 100th year of
the Troop’s charter.
Troop 2 was chartered in 1919 and is the
oldest continuous Boy Scout Troop in the Fox
Valley. While four other troops were also char-
tered in 1919, only Troop 2 has continuously
held meetings. The longest serving Scout-
master, Harold Brown, kept the Troop active
from 1925–1962 through the Great Depres-
sion, World War II, and the Korean War.
Today the Troop boasts over 50 members.
Throughout the years, Troop 2 has re-
mained committed to preparing young people
to become leaders in their community. Over
120 Eagle Scouts hail from Troop 2. In addi-
tion, several Troop members have earned the
Order of the Arrow, a Scout Achievement
Award based on peer-recognition that places a
scout in the top percentiles of Scouting.
Each year, Troop 2 dedicates countless
hours to serving the community. Scouts volun-
teer at local nature reserves and YMCAs, and
assist in trash and recycling efforts for com-
munity events such as Oktoberfest and Mile of
Music. The scouts also go camping once a
month and participate in weekly Troop meet-
ings.
Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to rise in
recognition of the 100-year celebration of Boy
Scout Troop 2’s charter. I would like to thank
current Scoutmaster Ron Litsheim for his dedi-
cation to the success of Troop 2, and to the
scouts for their service to and leadership
throughout the community.

AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF
GEOGRAPHERS RESOLUTION ON
CLIMATE CHANGE
HON. JAMES P. MCGOVERN
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise to
include in the RECORD the following resolution
on climate change, adopted by the American
Association of Geographers on April 3, 2019.
[From the American Association of
Geographers, April 3, 2019]
AAG RESOLUTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE 1
(Adopted by the AAG Council)
Whereas: The American Association of
Geographers (AAG) is a nonprofit scientific
and educational society founded in 1904 with
close to 12,000 members in 2019 who are lo-
cated in the United States and nearly 100
other countries;
Whereas: The objectives of the Association
are to further professional investigations in
geography and to encourage the application
of geographic findings in education, govern-
ment, and business;
Whereas: Gilbert F. White (1911–2006) was
among the most distinguished and honored
American geographers of the 20th Century
who stimulated efforts to foster and improve
human adjustments to the risks of our en-
dangered planet through better-informed
public and private sector decision-making;
Whereas: Gilbert F. White was awarded the
National Medal of Science by President Clin-
ton in 2000 for ‘‘major contributions to the
study of water systems in developing coun-
tries, global environmental change, inter-
national cooperation, nuclear winter, geog-
raphy education and the mitigation of nat-
ural hazards including earthquakes, hurri-
canes, and drought;’’
Whereas: The planet is now experiencing
more frequent, more intense, and more cost-
ly disasters associated with anthropogenic
climate change in the forms of prolonged
drought, wildfires, intensified hurricanes,
coastal and river flooding and extreme tem-
peratures. Deglaciation of mountainous re-
gions threatens water supplies and hydro-
power generation for hundreds of millions of
people in Asia, Europe, western Latin Amer-
ica, and the Pacific Northwest. Accelerated
melting of Arctic and Antarctic land ice will
cause rising sea levels to inundate portions
of coastal cities worldwide by mid-century;
Whereas: At the global scale, the last four
years have been the hottest on record. One-
fifth of all corals have died in the past three
years. World carbon emissions rose 2.7 per-
cent in 2018 despite efforts by many nations
to meet the goals of the 2016 Paris Climate
Agreement;
Whereas: As climate change renders vast
areas of the globe uninhabitable, mass popu-
lation migrations and competition for water,
arable land, and living space will heighten
the likelihood of armed conflict, either con-
ventional or nuclear;
Whereas: Gilbert F. White challenged pro-
fessional geographers to study and commu-
nicate the risks of our endangered planet and
to help stimulate responsible policies and de-
cisions by all sectors of human society;
Therefore be it resolved that: In the spirit
of Gilbert F. White, the American Associa-
tion of Geographers urges the Government of
the United States to resume its leadership in
combating climate change, including (but
not limited to) strategies that:
1. Recognize human activities as the pre-
eminent cause of accelerating climate
change, as emphatically concluded by the
International Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) and the Fourth U.S. National Climate
Assessment, among many other authori-
tative studies around the world;
2. Reaffirm U.S. commitment to the Paris
Climate Agreement, and—in cooperation
with the international community—inten-
sify efforts to limit emissions of greenhouse
gasses to control further rise in global tem-
peratures;
3. Ratify Kigali Amendment of the Mon-
treal Protocol to limit hydrofluorocarbon
(HFC) production and consumption;
4. Encourage transition of the U.S. econ-
omy to embrace energy conservation and
substitution of sustainable energy sources in
place of fossil fuels;
5. Reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
through incentives, taxes, regulations, pub-
lic transit, carbon recapture and other
means;
6. Promote continued innovation by states
and local governments and the private sector
to conserve energy and reduce dependence on
fossil fuels (e.g. through ‘‘LEED’’ green
building codes, reforestation and reduced de-
forestation, watershed management, sustain-
able transportation, and other means);

7. Stimulate public and private sector deci-
sion-makers to prepare for rapid-onset im-
pacts of climate change (e.g. wildfire, elec-
trical grid failure, fuel and water shortages,
and coastal flooding) through enhanced
emergency response, relief, and recovery ca-
pabilities;
8. Reaffirm that climate change policy at
all levels of society from international to
local must be based on sound, verifiable
science as reflected in the IPCC reports, the
U.S. National Climate Assessment Reports,
and other authoritative studies by scientists
around the world;
Be it further resolved that: The AAG will
publicize this resolution to government lead-
ers, to other scientific bodies, and to the
general public through a press release and
other available means. The MG should fur-
ther encourage its membership to stimulate
public understanding of climate change and
its potential impacts (including armed con-
flicts) through relevant research, teaching,
publications, and participation in public fo-
rums, study panels, oped columns, blog
posts, and other available means.

HONORING FORMER POSTMASTER
LOUIS A. JACKSON
HON. STACEY E. PLASKETT
OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor former Postmaster Louis A.
Jackson, a native son of the Virgin Islands
who dedicated 46 years of his life to the
United States Postal Service and serving the
American people. During his time with the
Postal Service, Mr. Louis Jackson was integral
in the building of new post offices, expanding
delivery routes, and has served as a mentor
for many.
An accomplished and venerable Post-
master, he made a significant difference to the
postal system throughout the Virgin Islands
and is a three-time winner of the Postal Serv-
ice’s prestigious National Benjamin Award.
Many in the community relied on the steady
hand and calm demeanor of Mr. Jackson in
resolving postal and other issues in the com-
munity.
Outside of the Postal Service, Postmaster
Jackson is an active member of the commu-
nity. He has served as a mentor and coun-
selor for the countless young people in the
Virgin Islands and taught martial arts to over
3000 students. He also served as the Chair-
man of the St. Croix chapter of the American
Cancer Society, Vice President of the National
League of Postmasters, and much more. Post-
master Louis Jackson has lived his life enrich-
ing his community and it is my honor on be-
half of the 116th Congress and everyone who
has been touched by his work and kind spirit,
to say thank you.

COMMEMORATING WORLD RANGER
DAY
HON. TOM McCLINTOCK
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I rise
to observe World Ranger Day, which will be
commemorated on July 31, 2019.
World Ranger Day was first designated in
2007 as a day to honor Rangers across the
globe who have died in the line of duty while
protecting the world’s historic and natural won-
ders.
I am honored to represent just a few of
these landmarks in my district, including Yo-
semite and Kings Canyon National Parks. The
Rangers who patrol these parks work tirelessly
to protect visitors, promote recreation, and
preserve these majestic natural and cultural
resources. They are the eyes, ears, and often
the first responders across these lands; com-
batting animal poaching, vandalism, and even
wildfires on the frontlines of conservation.
Rangers counter these threats not just on our
own public lands, but across the globe.
From Harry Yount, the father of the ranger
service and the first national park ranger, to
the Buffalo Soldiers who fought wildfires and
poachers in Yosemite and Sequoia National
Parks, rangers have long recognized the need
to safeguard our most vital lands. It is our duty
to uphold the legacy and example of fallen
rangers and do our part to be responsible
stewards of our stunning natural wonders.
As President Theodore Roosevelt observed,
‘‘We have fallen heirs to the most glorious her-
itage a people ever received, and each one
must do his part if we wish to show that the
nation is worthy of its good fortune.’’ Our
Rangers have gone above and beyond to live
up to this call, and we owe them a great debt
of gratitude.

FRANK RIESINGER
HON. KEVIN HERN
OF OKLAHOMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Madam
Speaker, I rise today in honor of Frank
Riesinger and the valuable contributions he
makes to our community.
Mr. Riesinger served as an airman in World
War II and has been the driving force behind
the V-J Day celebrations here in Broken
Arrow, commemorating the end of World War
II on August 14th, 1945.
Mr. Riesinger recalls America’s great Victory
Over Japan from when he was just an 18-
year-old airman home in Tulsa on furlough. He
remembers standing in his dad’s office down-
town when he heard an uproar coming from
the streets and saw Tulsans celebrating with
shouts and car horns, making celebratory
noise with whatever they could. This memory
has inspired him to continue celebrating that
triumphant day.
Thanks to Mr. Riesinger, V-J Day has been
commemorated by Oklahomans for the past
four years through this wonderful event. I ap-
preciate his work to make sure that this monu-
mental day for the U.S. and Oklahomans, is
still remembered.
Although V-J Day is not nationally recog-
nized, the Broken Arrow City Council issued a
proclamation making August 14th V-J Day
Celebration Day for Oklahomans.
I am grateful for Mr. Riesinger’s service to
our country and community. Mr. Riesinger’s
impact on Oklahomans is one that will never
be forgotten.
HONORING MENDOCINO COAST
CLINICS
HON. JARED HUFFMAN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of Mendocino Coast Clin-
ics on the 25th anniversary of their founding.
Since 1994, Mendocino Coast Clinics has pro-
vided quality, patient-centered affordable
health care.
Originally part of Mendocino County Public
Health Services, a group of volunteers came
together to form the nonprofit that established
Mendocino Coast Clinics on July 1, 1994. That
original group became the first board of direc-
tors of the new health center, which served
2,500 patients with a staff of seven. Today,
Mendocino Coast Clinics serves more than
10,000 patients and is the third-largest em-
ployer in the city of Fort Bragg.
Mendocino Coast Clinics provided behav-
ioral health services to the medical services
when its doors opened in 1994, and expanded
to provide much-needed dental services in
1996. Throughout the past 25 years,
Mendocino Coast Clinics has continued to fill
medical services gaps in the Fort Bragg and
surrounding communities, including obstetrics,
pediatrics, and a confidential reproductive
health care clinic for teens and young adults.
Today, Mendocino Coast Clinics continues to
provide these comprehensive services to the
community.
Madam Speaker, Mendocino Coast Clinics
has for 25 years been a tireless champion for
health care in coastal Mendocino County,
meeting the needs of the community’s most
vulnerable populations. Therefore, please join
me in recognizing this valuable organization
and wishing them success for many more
years to come.

his wife, Helen and they cherished 64 years of
marriage together. The couple raised two
sons, Gary and John. Leonard built the farm-
house the family lived in from the ground.
An active member of the community, Leon-
ard still attends mass at St. Joseph’s Catholic

BIRTHDAY OF WILLIE MAUDE
ATKINSON
HON. MIKE ROGERS
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker,
I rise to recognize the 100th birthday of Willie
Maude Atkinson.
Willie Maude Atkinson was born on August
20, 1919 to Maude and Will Bates of Hobson
City, Alabama. She attended the Calhoun
County Training School (formerly C.E. Hanna
Elementary School and currently Hobson City
Hall), and has been a member of New Hope
Missionary Baptist Church since 1930.
In 1942, Willie Maude married Clyde R. At-
kinson. Clyde passed away in 1988. They
were blessed with three children, five grand-
children, five great-grandchildren and a host of
nieces and nephews. She is the oldest citizen
born in Hobson City, and the oldest member
of the Priscilla and Aquila Order of the Eastern
Star.
In the early 1940s, Willie Maude was hired
by Howard and Katherine Bentley to assist
with the care of their seven children while Mr.
Bentley was serving overseas during World
War II. The Bentley children and grandchildren
considered her a ‘‘second mother and grand-
mother.’’ She remained employed by them
until her retirement in the late 1990s. She also
assisted the Bailey, Dewberry, Dumas and
Pyles families with home care.
Willie Maude Atkinson has positively influ-
enced many lives in her lifetime. She is a
mother, grandmother and great-grandmother
to her family and her ‘‘adopted’’ families. Her
love and wisdom have been passed on for
several generations.
Madam Speaker, please join me in wishing
Willie Maude Atkinson a happy 100th birthday.

HONORING TUNISIAN PRESIDENT
BEJI CAID ESSEBSI
HON. JOE WILSON
OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam
Speaker, the United States today stands in
solidarity with the noble people of Tunisia as
they mourn the passing of their first democrat-
ically elected president, Beji Caid Essebsi.
The world will never forget President
Essebsi’s remarkable stewardship of Tunisia’s
democratic transition after the 2011 Arab
Spring uprisings. He was the right man at the
right time: a seasoned politician for more than
60 years, President Essebsi was the only Tu-
nisian politician to hold political office in the
new democracy as well as throughout dictator-
ships of Habib Borguiba and Zine el-Abidine
Ben Ali. A statement issued by the Tunisian
government upon President Essebsi’s passing
rightly called him one of Tunisia’s ‘‘greatest
men and one of those who contributed the
most to building it.’’
Tunisia flowered into the model democracy
borne out of the Arab Spring in part due the
commitment of Tunisians like President
Essebsi to realize the dream of Tunisian de-
mocracy. Despite being an ardent secularist
who championed the rights of women, Presi-
dent Essebsi was also always ready to en-
gage all elements of Tunisian society, includ-
ing the Islamists, precisely because he be-
lieved that all Tunisians have a right to polit-
ical participation.
As the Tunisian people mourn this great
loss, the people of the United States stand
with them, ready to lend a helping hand to
overcome this next challenging chapter. We
send our heartfelt condolences to President
Essebsi’s family and the Tunisian people. I
have no doubt that the people of Tunisia will
honor the legacy of President Essebsi’s life
through their continued awe-inspiring dedica-
tion to democracy and the rule of law.

CONGRATULATING NANCY
LACEWELL ON HER RETIREMENT
HON. JOHN A. YARMUTH
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Nancy Lacewell on her
retirement. Since 1999, Nancy has served as
the Director of Government and Community
Affairs at the American Printing House for the
Blind in Louisville, Kentucky. She has been a
tremendous asset both to the American Print-
ing House for the Blind and the United States
Congress. Nancy has been a fixture on Cap-
itol Hill for more than two decades, serving as
a valuable resource for members and staff on
both sides of the aisle. A tireless advocate,
Nancy has educated Members of the House
and Senate on the unique needs of people
who are blind and visually impaired, informing
us on the latest technological advances avail-
able to that population. She was instrumental
in establishing and coordinating the National
Prison Braille Network, a partnership with the
Printing House and more than 35 U.S. prisons
offering offenders an opportunity to learn
braille. Through Nancy’s hard work the pro-
gram has been a major success, to the point
where many of the textbooks for blind school
students are now transcribed through the pris-
on braille program.
Nancy received her Masters of Arts in
French Language and Literature from the Uni-
versity of Louisville. In her retirement, I hope
that she will be able to capitalize on those
skills to travel to France and other destina-
tions, as well as enjoy life with her husband
Rick; her children Jeff, Corrine, and JP; loved
ones; and friends. I thank Nancy for being an
advocate, an ally, and source of inspiration for
me and for all who will follow in your foot-
steps. I wish them all the best in a much de-
served retirement.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MICKY
STEELE-BODGER
HON. GEORGE HOLDING
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. HOLDING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the life and lasting legacy of Micky
Steele-Bodger, who passed away on May 9th
at the age of 93. Micky was a larger than life
figure in the Rugby world for over 6 decades.
He is widely revered and beloved for his im-
mense contribution to the game and the
mentorship he provided to several generations
of young players and administrators.
Born on September 4, 1925 in Tamworth,
England to Henry William and Kathrine nee
Macdonald, Micky Steele-Bodger discovered
his passion for Rugby at a young age.
He rose to prominence on the pitch while at-
tending Cambridge University. As the captain
of the team, Micky twice played in the famous
‘‘Varsity Match’’ between Cambridge and Ox-
ford—a tradition dating back to 1872. In the
classroom, he followed in his Father’s foot-
steps by pursuing a veterinary degree.
Shortly after Cambridge, Micky earned him-
self a spot on the English national team—play-
ing in 9 matches from 1946 to 1948. Although
he had a relatively small frame and was only
5′ 8″, Micky’s ruthless determination, versatility
on the pitch, and deep knowledge of the game
set him apart from many of his competitors.
Unfortunately, his promising career came to
an abrupt end due to a bad knee injury when
he was only 24 years old. Despite no longer
being able to compete on the pitch, Micky was
not prepared to walk away from the game he
loved. So he promptly transitioned to the ad-
ministrative and coaching side of the sport,
where he went on to make his most significant
and lasting impact.
In 1973, Micky was elected as President of
the Rugby Football Union and in 1981 he be-
came Chair of the International Rugby Board.
Seven years later, in 1988, Micky was se-
lected as the 6th President of Barbarian F.C.,
an illustrious Rugby club based in Britain. Dur-
ing his 31 year tenure; he molded the club into
one of Rugby’s marquee organizations. He
was regarded as an inspiration and mentor for
countless young players, instilling in them the
importance of class, sportsmanship, and work
ethic.
While Micky will go down in history as one
of Rugby’s most important and impactful fig-
ures, he will also be remembered as one of
England’s greatest clubmen.
As the longtime Chairman and President of
the East India Club, Micky mentored genera-
tions of young men. Micky introduced us to
the pleasures and gentility of club life.
I will always miss my friend, Micky. But I will
also always remember him fondly every time
I walk through the doors of the East India
Club.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it’s my
honor to recognize Timothy J. Nelson for his
service as President of Northwestern Michigan
College. Through his exceptional leadership
and steadfast devotion to educational excel-
lence, Tim has become an indispensable part
of Michigan’s First District.
Serving as President of NMC since 2001,
Tim has led the college through a dramatic
transition and growth as it worked to provide
its learners and communities with the skills,
experiences and values that will help them to
create social and economic wealth during their
lifetimes.
In 2011, President Nelson and his wife
spearheaded the Global Opportunities Fund,
with the goal of providing opportunities for
NMC faculty, students, and staff to engage in
projects with international partners, exchange
knowledge with countries around the world,
enhance the learning of world languages, and
improve communication across different cul-
tures. The college has also developed global
partnerships with educational institutions in
Brazil, China, Costa Rica, the United King-
dom, India, and others—making NMC one of
the premier community colleges for providing
global experiences.
Under Tim’s leadership, NMC has also been
committed to helping Veterans achieve their
goals, succeed in college, and move onto the
next chapter in their lives. Additionally, Tim
has worked to include faculty, staff, students,
and the local community in conversations re-
lated to the future of the college, promoting a
culture of inclusivity and success.
Outside of his service as NMC President,
Tim has provided valuable support and exper-
tise as a member and leader in the Michigan
Community College Association, the American
Association of Community Colleges, the Mun-
son Medical Center Board of Trustees, the
Traverse City Rotary Club, the Traverse City
Chamber of Commerce, and multiple other
state and community organizations. Tim will
retire on December 31, 2019, as the longest-
serving President in the college’s history. His
impact on the people of Northern Michigan
cannot be overstated.
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to congratu-
late Timothy Nelson for his 18 years of service
as President of Northwestern Michigan Col-
lege. Michiganders can take great pride in
knowing the First District is home to such a
dedicated leader. On behalf of my constitu-
ents, I wish Tim all the best in his future en-
deavors.
TRIBUTE TO AUTHOR AND POLIT-
ICAL THEORIST OF 20TH CEN-
TURY AMERICAN CONSERV-
ATISM, DR. RUSSELL KIRK
HON. JOHN R. MOOLENAAR
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. MOOLENAAR. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to pay tribute to the late Dr. Russell
Kirk, a political theorist, moralist, historian, and
literary critic, in honor of the historical marker
being placed at his beloved home and library
in Mecosta, Michigan next month.
As a resident of Mecosta County and a
Michigan native, Dr. Kirk led numerous semi-
nars on political theory, culture and virtue
while teaching fellows and students for over
40 years, a tradition that his gracious wife, An-
nette Kirk, still values and honors today
through the Russell Kirk Center. Since his
passing in 1994, his home has become an
educational destination for continued interest
in his work by students and scholars alike.
As the author of thirty-two books covering
topics from political theory to cultural criticism,
Dr. Kirk is considered one of the preeminent
thinkers of his time. His first published book in
1953, The Conservative Mind: From Burke to
Eliot, is one of the most widely reviewed and
discussed studies of political ideals in Amer-
ica. Along with his subsequent writings on the
topic, Dr. Kirk shaped the modern ideas of
American conservatism. As an elite scholar,
Dr. Kirk shared his brilliance through his pro-
digious literary works and received one of our
nation’s highest honors when President Ron-
ald Reagan conferred the Presidential Citizens
Medal upon him in 1989.
Dr. Kirk found his true joy in addressing col-
lege audiences because he believed the key
to the lasting success of conservative ideas
rested on shaping the cultural and moral be-
liefs of the next generation. In his books, arti-
cles, speeches, and interviews, Dr. Kirk
shaped the thinking of generations of conserv-
atives around the world. His ideas have per-
sonally helped me in forming my own beliefs
and it is a privilege to pay special tribute to Dr.
Kirk and his legacy today.
On behalf of the Fourth Congressional Dis-
trict of Michigan, I am honored to recognize
Dr. Russell Kirk’s illustrious career and extend
my appreciation for his hard work and dedica-
tion. The historical marker in front of his cher-
ished home in Mecosta will help ensure his
ideas live on for future generations.

RECOGNIZING RIDE4GABE FOR
BRINGING NEEDED AWARENESS
TO DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYS-
TROPHY
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, on behalf
of Representatives PALMER, SEWELL, KELLY
(TRENT), KUSTOFF, COHEN, CRAWFORD, HILL,
WESTERMAN, WOMACK, MULLIN, HERN, LUCAS,
THORNBERRY, LUJÁN, BUCK, TIPTON, and LAM-
BORN, I want to recognize three men who will
attempt to pedal their bicycles from Bir-
mingham, Alabama to Colorado Springs, Colo-
rado between July 28 and August 3, 2019.
Ride4Gabe IV, as it is called, will take the cy-
clists through eight states in seven days . The
group plans to pedal 300 miles the first day
followed by days of 234, 198, 206, 232, 232,
and 76 miles. The final leg of Ride4Gabe IV
will be from Pueblo, Colorado up to 14,115
feet elevation at the summit of Pikes Peak in
Colorado Springs.
Gabe Griffin, a 14-year-old from Bir-
mingham, Alabama, is the inspiration behind
Ride4Gabe. After Gabe was diagnosed with
Duchenne, his parents created the non-profit
Hope for Gabe Foundation to raise awareness
and support efforts to develop a cure for this
devastating condition. Michael Staley (38) of
Hoover, Alabama, and Wes Bates (24) of
Nagoya, Japan, began Ride4Gabe in 2014
when they rode across Oregon, Idaho, Wyo-
ming, Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois,
Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama.
According to Parent Project Muscular Dys-
trophy, Duchenne is the most common fatal
genetic disorder diagnosed in childhood, af-
fecting approximately 1 in every 3,500 live
male births (about 20,000 new cases each
year worldwide). Because the Duchenne gene
is found on the X-chromosome, it primarily af-
fects males; however, it occurs across all
races and cultures and there are cases of fe-
males with Duchenne.
Duchenne results in progressive loss of
strength and is caused by a mutation in the
gene that encodes for dystrophin. Because
dystrophin is absent, the muscle cells are eas-
ily damaged. The progressive muscle weak-
ness leads to serious medical problems, par-
ticularly issues relating to the heart and lungs.
Individuals with Duchenne typically live into
their late twenties.
Building on the success of the first
Ride4Gabe event, Payne Griffin, 23, of Wash-
ington, D.C. joined Michael and Wes for
Ride4Gabe II in 2016 and the group pedaled
across Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New
York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Ten-
nessee, Alabama, and Florida. Brian Toone,
42, of Hoover, Alabama, dubbed his effort
Ride4Gabe Ill as he competed, in the grueling
Race Across America. Brian finished 3rd place
overall as he traversed California, Arizona,
Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indi-
ana, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and
Maryland in just over ten days.
The Ride4Gabe IV team will be live stream-
ing their adventure online as they pass
through Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Ar-
kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, and
Colorado. As the riders tire and their muscles
get sore, they will draw strength and inspira-
tion from Gabe and the Duchenne community.
Their hero, Gabe, would love to ride a bicycle
with them but Duchenne makes doing so im-
possible. With our help, Duchenne patients
like Gabe can continue to hope for a cure so
they, too, can go on an epic bike ride or play
baseball, football, or basketball with their
friends.
On behalf of my colleagues representing
congressional districts along the Ride4Gabe
IV route, I am pleased to recognize
Ride4Gabe IV. The awareness that will be
raised through Ride4Gabe will lead to greater
public awareness about Duchenne Muscular
Dystrophy. It is our hope that Gabe Griffin and
every other patient who suffers from
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy will soon have
access to a treatment and ultimately a cure.

CONGRATULATING PROFESSORS
BARBARA MCFARLAND AND MI-
CHAEL WHITEMAN
HON. JOE CUNNINGHAM
OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Professors Barbara
McFarland and Michael Whiteman as they
step down from the faculty at the Chase Col-
lege of Law at Northern Kentucky University.
Their tenure has brought Chase bigger ideas,
brighter days, and better futures for any stu-
dent lucky enough to sit in their classrooms.
One of Professor McFarland’s greatest gifts
is to provide every student she encounters
with the resources and encouragement to
achieve their best work—in law school and be-
yond. After 15 years at Chase, she is retiring
to continue her work inspiring young minds,
this time with young, at-risk children.
I took a short quiz to celebrate Professor
Whiteman’s retirement and I scored a 6/10,
which was pretty similar to some of my scores
in his class! After 17 successful years at
Chase, Professor Whiteman is headed off to a
law school down the road. Professor White-
man has been described by his colleagues as
one of the most genuine and kind-hearted
people they have ever met, and I truly could
not agree any more.
I know firsthand that Professors McFarland
and Whiteman’s passion for supporting a stu-
dent’s success can be the definitive factor be-
tween giving up and getting a degree, and I
am so thankful for the impact they had on my
educational and personal development. Pro-
fessors McFarland and Whiteman are about to
begin new journeys for themselves, but they
can rest assured that their legacies will live on
in the Chase Law School community. I thank
them for all they have done and wish them
good luck in all future endeavors.

IN RECOGNITION OF CHIEF DEP-
UTY ALLEN KRAEGER’S RETIRE-
MENT FROM THE WAUPACA
COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Chief Deputy Allen Kraeger
on celebrating his retirement from the
Waupaca County Sheriff’s Office. His leader-
ship left a major impact on Wisconsin law en-
forcement and is an excellent example of
service to the community.
Chief Deputy Kraeger is an exceptional pub-
lic servant who dedicated his professional life
to upholding the law. Starting as Reserve
Deputy in 1972, Chief Deputy Kraeger held
positions as a Corrections Officer and Patrol-
man before beginning full time employment as
a Highway Patrolman with the Waupaca
County Highway Patrol in 1978. After the
merging of the Waupaca County Highway Pa-
trol and Waupaca County Sheriff’s Office in
1983, Chief Deputy Kraeger was reassigned
as a Patrol Deputy with the Sheriff’s Office.
Chief Deputy Kraeger served in many roles
during his tenure with the Waupaca County
Sheriff’s Office. He was designated as the first
Rapid Intense Specific Competencies Instruc-
tor, promoted to the position of Detective Ser-
geant, and appointed to his current position of
Chief Deputy in 1996. Through all these posi-
tions, he exemplified a steadfast commitment
to providing superior service and protection to
the communities of Waupaca County.
During his time as Chief Deputy, Chief Dep-
uty Kraeger was instrumental in promoting
teamwork, communication, and strategy to
combat controlled substance violations. He
embraced the Office’s membership and partici-
pation in the Central Wisconsin Drug Task
Force. He was also instrumental in the assign-
ment of two full-time Drug Investigator posi-
tions within the Waupaca County Sheriff’s Of-
fice. Chief Deputy Kraeger was also a mem-
ber of several professional organizations in-
cluding the Wisconsin Narcotics Officers Asso-
ciation, National Narcotic Officers Association
Coalition, and Wisconsin Sheriff’s and Deputy
Sheriff’s Association, to name a few.
Chief Deputy Kraeger served with diligence,
selflessness, and bravery throughout his law
enforcement career. Waupaca County is fortu-
nate to have officers like Chief Deputy
Kraeger who exemplify and exceed their oath
to serve and protect. I am proud to represent
men and women with such commitment to
their communities and our country.
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this
body to join me in thanking Chief Deputy
Kraeger for his service and dedication to pro-
tecting our community. I congratulate him on
an exceptional 41-year career with the
Waupaca County Sheriff’s Office and wish him
well as he marks the conclusion of an accom-
plished career.

LET ALL U.S. CITIZENS TRAVEL
TO CUBA RESTORE THEIR RIGHT
TO TRAVEL—H.R. 3960
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I am
proud to introduce today H.R. 3960, the Free-
dom for Americans to Travel to Cuba Act of
2019, along with my colleagues, Representa-
tives TOM EMMER (R–MN), KATHY CASTOR (D–
FL), RICK CRAWFORD (R–AR), BARBARA LEE
(D–CA), DARIN LAHOOD (R–IL), JOSÉ SERRANO
(D–NY), GUY RESCHENTHALER (R–PA), DON-
ALD BEYER, JR. (D–VA), and DENVER
RIGGLEMAN (R–VA). I’m also proud to stand
with my good friend, Senator PATRICK LEAHY,
who will be introducing this bill in the Senate
on Monday with 45 bipartisan cosponsors.
This bipartisan bill addresses an issue I
care very deeply about—the right of American
citizens—my constituents—to travel freely any-
where in the world. Freedom of movement,
freedom to travel, the basic right of any U.S.
citizen to choose freely where they can go in
this world has always been a fundamental part
of being an American.
Foreign governments might choose to deny
our citizens a visa. They might restrict where
Americans can go when they arrive inside a
foreign country. But the U.S. government and
the U.S. Congress should not be in the busi-
ness of imposing restrictions on our own citi-
zens.
Yet this is what Congress has done to U.S.
citizens when it comes to only one country for
the last 60 years—Cuba.
Americans can travel to China, Saudi Ara-
bia, Vietnam, Russia, Iran and Syria—each
with human rights records arguably as bad or
worse than Cuba’s and, it should be noted,
each of these countries also support Nicholas
Maduro in Venezuela. And until just recently,
Americans could even travel to North Korea.
This is an anachronistic policy, left over
from the Cold War and proven to be ineffec-
tive at leveraging change by the Cuban gov-
ernment. The only people it harms are Amer-
ican citizens and those in Cuba striving to cre-
ate innovative economic alternatives to state-
controlled enterprises.
Ironically, continued efforts to further restrict
the right of Americans to travel to Cuba have
had devastating consequences for Cuba’s
fledgling private sector—the very people the
United States aims to help—which had grown
to be approximately 30 percent of Cuban
economy as a result of more Americans trav-
eling to the island during the last Administra-
tion.
Madam Speaker, I believe that the Amer-
ican people are our very best ambassadors;
that they reflect the democratic values, curi-
osity, and innovation that make our country so
great. Congress should not be in the business
of denying them their own rights.
Congress stripped away this basic right, and
only Congress can restore it. It’s past time for
us to do so. I urge all my colleagues, on both
sides of the aisle, to cosponsor this bipartisan
bill and ensure its passage in the 116th Con-
gress.
I include in the RECORD an opinion piece by
Chris Sabatini entitled, Trump Doubles Down
on Failed Cuba Policy, which was published in
The New York Times on July 24, 2019.
[From the New York Times, July 24, 2019]
TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON FAILED CUBA
POLICY
THE CUBAN AUTOCRACY REMAINS A NAGGING RE-
MINDER OF UNITED STATES IMPOTENCE IN
ROOTING OUT COMMUNISM
(By Christopher Sabatini)
The Trump administration’s effort to bring
about the end of Cuba’s repressive govern-
ment by squeezing the island’s economy
promises only more suffering for Cuban citi-
zens, who are already struggling under Fidel
Castro’s failed economic project.
The White House is hurting the very peo-
ple—ordinary Cubans—it claims to support.
Not only are their potential sources of inde-
pendent income (and, with it, political inde-
pendence) drying up, so is their access to
food—and their hopes for the future.
For decades, the Cuban autocracy has been
a nagging reminder of United States impo-
tence in rooting out Communism. Washing-
ton’s embargo on Havana was tightened by
Congress in 1992 and 1996—with the uninten-
tionally ironic titles of the Cuban Democ-
racy Act and what’s known as the Cuban
Liberty Act.
This pressure has always come with tough
talk from Republicans, who like to claim
that the Castro government’s time is up.
John Bolton, the national security adviser,
is the latest hawk to spew this empty rhet-
oric.
Yet more than 58 years of isolating Havana
has shown that the strategy doesn’t follow
any logical theory of regime change, even if
it plays well in South Florida. Isolation has
only reinforced the Cuban government’s ef-
fort to make its citizens economically de-
pendent on the Communist state.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E998 July 25, 2019
There was a brief break in America’s hard-
line approach when, in December 2014, Presi-
dent Barack Obama announced a loosening
of the embargo and the normalization of re-
lations. President Trump reversed course
and rolled out many of the past, failed sanc-
tions against Cuba, plus some new ones.
Those have included restricting Ameri-
cans’ travel to officially approved group
trips with cultural organizations, ending the
allowance for American cruise ships to dock
in Cuban ports, plans to reduce to $1,000 the
amount of money that Cuban-Americans can
send to Cuba every three months, and allow-
ing United States citizens to sue foreign
companies over the use of property expropri-
ated by the Castro government (a provision
suspended by Republican and Democratic ad-
ministrations since it was passed in 1996).
By the White House’s own admission, these
policies will reduce by half the number of
American tourists visiting the island. That
number last year was 600,000. American tour-
ists had been helping to support the private
restaurants, shops and the approximately
20,000 Airbnb’s that have sprung up in recent
years.
Support for Havana from the regime in
Venezuela, another target of the Trump ad-
ministration, has been halted, compounding
Cuba’s economic troubles.
Shortly after he was inaugurated as presi-
dent of Venezuela in 1999, Hugo Chávez,
threw the struggling Cuban economy a life-
line, sending 100,000 barrels of oil a day, half
of which the Cuban government sold on the
world market for hard currency. As partial
payment for the cheap oil, Cubans provided
intelligence and military support to Mr.
Chávez and to his successor, Nicolás Maduro,
to help them consolidate their corrupt, auto-
cratic project.
But as Venezuelan oil production plunged
in recent years, and global prices fell, Cuba’s
life-support system dried up to between
20,000 and 50,000 barrels per day, as of April.
The Trump administration has seen the
weakness of these two economies as an op-
portunity to push for regime change in both
countries.
The first target was Mr. Maduro, hoping
his fall would bring democracy to his coun-
try and thus bankrupt the Cuban regime, fi-
nally bringing it to its knees. Now, as ad-
ministration officials face their failed,
overhyped efforts to topple Mr. Maduro, they
have changed their focus: they are blaming
Cuba for Mr. Maduro’s survival—rather than
Mr. Maduro for the Cuban government’s sur-
vival.
Cubans—and the Cuban leaders—have been
through worse. American restrictions on
trade and travel to Cuba are minor compared
to the difficulties they faced after the col-
lapse of the Soviet Union, during which the
Cuban economy contracted by more than one
third. Even then, with food, electricity and
hope all in short supply, the Castro govern-
ment survived.
Today, Cuba’s leadership, under Raúl Cas-
tro’s handpicked successor, Miguel Dı́az-
Canel, is once again rallying the island na-
tion’s citizens to tighten their belts, for ex-
ample by promoting hutia, a local rodent, as
a source of protein. And other authoritarian
powers, like China and Russia, are more than
willing to throw even just a bit of economic
help, and lots of anti-American ideological
support, which didn’t exist during the post-
Cold War period.
The Trump administration’s strategy will
fail, as it has in the past, and ordinary Cuban
citizens will continue to bare the brunt of a
misguided American policy. When will Amer-
ican leaders finally learn the lessons of his-
tory?
TRIBUTE TO KEVIN L. SHAFER,
P.E., RECIPIENT OF THE MIL-
WAUKEE WATER COUNCIL’S
THIRD ANNUAL ‘‘WATER WAR-
RIOR OF THE YEAR’’ AWARD
HON. GWEN MOORE
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Kevin Shafer, the long serving Exec-
utive Director of the Milwaukee Metropolitan
Sewerage District (MMSD) and a recent recipi-
ent of the Milwaukee Water Council’s third an-
nual ‘‘Water Warrior of the Year Award,’’
which is given to acknowledge those in the
water industry who advance the importance of
Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math
(STEAM) education.
MMSD provides wastewater treatment rec-
lamation and flood management, among other
services, for about 1.1 million customers in 28
communities in the Greater Milwaukee Area
The award acknowledges Kevin’s dedication
to growing MMSD’s internship program which
provides students with hands-on learning ex-
perience to inspire and educate students
about future water-related careers in areas
such as water quality protection, laboratory
services, engineering, construction and sus-
tainability. According to the CEO of the Water
Council, ‘‘When it comes to supporting and
nurturing our next generation of water profes-
sionals we always know that Kevin will say an
emphatic yes when we ask him to do more.’’
For over 25 years, MMSD has grown its in-
ternship program which now hires 25 students
every summer. For example, during the sum-
mer of 2018, MMSD worked with the Water
Council to place two African-American junior
engineering students from Tuskegee Univer-
sity to work as interns with a goal of increas-
ing the number of African-Americans pursuing
water as a career. This is just one of several
efforts by MMSD to invest in and develop a di-
verse water workforce in the Milwaukee area.
Kevin Shafer has served as executive direc-
tor of MMSD since 2002. Throughout his ca-
reer at MMSD, Kevin has helped to make the
utility a leader when it comes to the adoption
and use of green infrastructure, has been in-
strumental in efforts to transform MMSD ’s
stormwater management system, and con-
tinues to foster innovative means of protecting
the District’s water supply.
Prior to this position, Kevin worked in the
private sector at an international engineering
firm and spent six years with the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers. Currently, Kevin is a
Chair on both the United States’ Water Alli-
ance Board of Directors and the Water Coun-
cil Board of Directors. Kevin was formerly
President of the National Association of Clean
Water Agencies.
It is an honor to recognize Kevin Shafer for
his dedication to the residents served by
MMSD and in being an innovative water in-
dustry leader who is constantly trying to find
new ways to deal with the challenges facing
MMSD. I applaud the high level of profes-
sionalism and service that he has brought to
MMSD and have no doubt he will continue to
serve our community in the same distin-
guished manner as he has done throughout
his career.
IN RECOGNITION OF WAHCONAH
PARK’S 100TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I would like to
take this opportunity to recognize the 100th
anniversary of Wahconah Park in Pittsfield,
Massachusetts. Wahconah Park has been a
loyal, magical home for America’s favorite
pastime since the 19th century, when the
game of baseball was first played on its
grounds in 1892. Most of the ballpark’s facili-
ties, however, including its wooden grand-
stand, were officially built in 1919—and they
have filled with lovers of the game ever since.
Over the course of more than a century,
Wahconah Park has hosted numerous Minor
League Baseball teams, other professional
clubs and affiliates, as well as summer colle-
giate teams—like the Pittsfield Suns, who cur-
rently call Wahconah home. As the Pittsfield
Suns’ team owner Jeff Goldklang has said,
baseball is about history, and it’s about memo-
ries. Wahconah Park is certainly steeped in
both. It is a testament to the game Americans
have loved for decades and continues to be a
destination for generations of families who
come to the Berkshires to watch it come to
life. And beyond baseball, Wahconah Park
has also played host to various high school
sporting events, and alternated into a concert
venue at times as well.
Once again, Madam Speaker, I would like to
congratulate Wahconah Park on the occasion
of its 100th anniversary. The ballpark is city-
owned and has been integral to the fabric of
Pittsfield’s community. It represents the lon-
gevity, history, and character of not only the
Berkshires, but all of western Massachusetts.

RECOGNIZING JERRY SHEA, SR.
HON. CLAY HIGGINS

Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize a pillar of Lou-
isiana, Iberia Parish icon, Jerry Shea, Sr., who
recently passed away at the age of 93.
Jerry was born in Louisiana and lived some
young years in Texas. He has been a resident
of New Iberia, LA, since 1942. After serving
three years in the Air Force and graduating
from Louisiana State University with a degree
in petroleum engineering, he went to work for
his father’s welding company, Bayou Welding
Works. Eventually Jerry and his late brother
Edward ‘‘Buddy’’ Shea, Jr. went on to start
several offshoots of Bayou, including Bayou
Pipe Coating in 1971. Jerry was inducted into
the National Association of Pipe Coating Appli-
cators Hall of Fame in 1996 and retired from
Bayou in 2000 after providing 55 years of
leadership in the family business. In addition
to his family business, he served as chairman
of the board of New Iberia National Bank dur-
ing the 1980s.
Despite his business success, Jerry is even
more well-known for his commitment and dedi-
cation to his community. He and his wife, Har-
riet, have received numerous recognitions for

their community involvement, including receiv-
ing the ‘‘Distinguished Citizen Award’’ from the
Boy Scouts Evangeline Area Council in 2001
and the 2013 Leaders in Philanthropy Award
from Community Foundation of Acadiana for
Iberia Parish. They also founded a scholarship
at Catholic High School. Most recently, Jerry
was the Grand Marshall of the local St. Pat-
rick’s Day Parade and a former King of the
Krewe of Andalusia. In fact, Jerry was so ac-
tive in New Iberia, people would often refer to
him as the ‘‘unofficial mayor of New Iberia.’’
Jerry’s impact on New Iberia, Louisiana, will
never be forgotten and he deserves great rec-
ognition. His passing is a true loss to his fam-
ily, his community and to Louisiana.

HONORING RECIPIENTS OF THE IN-
AUGURAL THIRD DISTRICT
YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR AWARDS
HON. ADRIAN SMITH
OF NEBRASKA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker,
today I honor five individuals and businesses
from Nebraska for receiving the Inaugural
Third District Young Entrepreneur Awards.
Throughout the 75 counties of the Third Dis-
trict, entrepreneurs and innovators are working
hard to grow opportunity in our state.
In May, I called for nominations as part of
a new initiative to recognize the young individ-
uals, businesses, and organizations in the
Third District who strengthen their commu-
nities through fresh ideas, hard work, and en-
trepreneurship.
Papa Moon Vineyards of Scottsbluff began
in 2007 as a grape growing hobby for the
Massey family, and has since evolved into an
absolute passion for grape cultivation and
craft-wine production. Over the next several
years, their passion evolved into a family busi-
ness. Named for the moniker the youngest
Massey family member gave his grandfather,
winery owner Jim, it has truly become a family
project. The Masseys opened their tasting
room in 2018 to share their passion for viticul-
ture and love of winemaking. They are a
proud family-owned farm winery, with a focus
on the cultivation and production of high qual-
ity product.
Upstream Farms of Albion, is led by broth-
ers Matthew and Joseph Brugger. They work
every day to bring new meaning to the phrase,
‘‘Farm to Table.’’ The Bruggers co-founded
Upstream with the goal of establishing better
rural communities. They saw few opportunities
for young people to become involved in agri-
culture, and wanted to create a business that
would inspire young agriculturalists and entre-
preneurs to pursue their passion in a rural
community. To demonstrate their desire to
embrace their vision, Upstream is more than
just a traditional farm. Upstream strives to
demonstrate diversification through action, of-
fering services in agronomy, technical innova-
tion, resale of market ready produce, and
angus products.
Striv Inc. of Henderson, is Jed by Taylor
Siebert. He discovered his passion for sharing
stories when he started the Heartland Beat, an
online blog and newsletter, to reach out to
alumni of Heartland Community School. This
experience inspired Taylor to explore other
avenues for schools and their alumni to create
and share content. This discovery process led
to the founding of Striv Inc. in 2012. Today,
Striv Inc. has taught hundreds of students the
necessary skills to provide high quality stream-
ing access and coverage of school events and
activities for their schools and communities.
The business currently provides educational
and streaming services to over 100 school dis-
tricts in Nebraska. Ever the innovator, Siebert
has never stopped creating. The purpose of
his latest development, ‘‘Class Intercom,’’ is to
help school districts more effectively utilize so-
cial media to maximize connection, promotion,
and information sharing in their communities.
Taylor could have created his internet-driven
business in any state in the country. He chose
to come back to Nebraska, back to his home-
town, and invest his talents in training tomor-
row’s leaders and creating a better version of
the, ‘‘The Good Life.’’
The Medina Street Vault Coffeehouse & Bi-
stro of Cairo is owned by Jenna Schweitzer.
Through the experiences of her high school
job as barista, owner Jenna Schweitzer real-
ized her life’s passion was coffee. She knew
she wanted to open her own coffee shop, and
to attempt to share her passion with her
hometown. In 2017, thanks to Jenna’s vision,
hard work, and the support of her family she
opened her coffee shop and bistro in a former
bank building in Cairo, and strategically se-
lected her food and drink menu to ensure she
complemented, and supported other local
businesses. Schweitzer feels The Vault has
become an experience area residents turn to
when they want a place to meet their friends,
relax, and lose two or three hours in conversa-
tion. Her goal of creating a family-centered en-
vironment to share her passion with others
has become a reality.
Game On of McCook is owned by Cody
Dame. Thanks to a 2007 submission to the
Hormel Business Plan Competition perma-
nently changed his professional direction. Win-
ning the business plan competition allowed
him to transition from owning his own traveling
videography and disc jockey service to pur-
suing his passion of building a community
through creating a fun and experiential envi-
ronment for all ages. Quickly growing from a
1,000 square foot retail space to a much larg-
er location in the community of McCook, Cody
has expanded into the communities of North
Platte, Kearney, and Grand Island as well.
Game On has become a successful regional
retail business, committed to strengthening the
communities in which they are present.
I am proud to recognize each of these
award winners today, and I thank them for
their many contributions to Nebraska.

TRIBUTE TO GEORGE MITROVICH
HON. SUSAN A. DAVIS
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker,
it is with great sorrow that I mourn the passing
of my friend, my neighbor, and San Diego
icon: George Mitrovich.
I often joked that one of the reasons I ran
for office was so that George could introduce
me at events. He was a dynamic and articu-
late speaker with a velvet voice. It was always
an honor to be introduced by him.
During the debate leading up to a vote on
the Affordable Care Act in 2009, I held a town
hall meeting with constituents to hear their
thoughts. I knew interest in the meeting was
very high and there would be a big crowd.
I thought to myself, who do I know who
could control a large, feisty—possibly angry—
group of people. Of course the answer was
George. When I asked him if he wanted to
take on the challenge, he said he was de-
lighted.
More than 1,200 people attended that town
hall and people were fired up. With his com-
manding presence, George deftly moderated
the event—kept folks in line and the pro-
ceedings on course.
It is virtually impossible to travel around San
Diego and not see George’s impact. He was
on just about every board and every commis-
sion. What an incredible amount of boundless
ideas and endless energy he had. And he
kept it up until his final days.
It wasn’t just San Diego that benefited from
his talents. George was active in causes and
events in many cities around the country.
George was a writer, a public speaker, and
an athlete. But mostly, he was a trusted and
loyal friend.
Above all, I send condolences to his loving
family.
It is safe to say that San Diego won’t see
the likes of George Mitrovich again.

Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam
Speaker, I rise to honor Hillary A. Davis, Con-
gressional Fellow with the Women’s Congres-
sional Policy Institute on Women and Public
Policy. For the past 7 months, Ms. Davis has
been working as a research and writing asso-
ciate.
Ms. Davis is a native of Tampa, Florida, and
chose to follow in her godmother’s footsteps
and attend the historic Fisk University in Nash-
ville, TN. There she majored in Political
Science, and while at Fisk, Ms. Davis estab-
lished herself as a servant leader by being
elected to serve on the Student Government
Association and as chapter president of Fisk’s
collegiate chapter of NAACP. Upon graduating
from Fisk, she returned to Tampa and began
a career as a human resource professional in
the information technology industry. Ms. Davis
also holds a Master of Public Administration
from Southern University and A&M College in
Baton Rouge, LA.
Throughout her time on the Committee, Ms.
Davis has displayed a high degree of profes-
sionalism and personal commitment to pro-
viding staff valuable insight and information. In
all of this, Ms. Davis has demonstrated benev-
olence, vitality, and enthusiasm, which has
helped all of us enormously.

IN RECOGNITION OF CODY
SPLITT’S 100TH BIRTHDAY
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor World War II veteran and re-
tired attorney Cody Splitt as she celebrates
her 100th birthday.
Esther ‘‘Cody’’ Splitt was born in Wausau,
Wisconsin in 1919. From a young age, Cody
knew she wanted to serve her country and
make an impact in her community. At the
height of WWII, she joined the U.S. Navy and
served in the Women Accepted for Volunteer
Emergency Service. While serving, she
worked on naval intelligence and was the
head of personnel for WAVES.
After leaving the Navy in 1945, Cody pur-
sued her dream of becoming a lawyer.
Through the G.I. Bill, she attended the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin-Madison where she was one
of five women in her class. She graduated in
just three years with a bachelor’s and law de-
gree.
Cody met and married her husband, Harley,
while attending UW-Madison. After her grad-
uation, the couple moved to Appleton where
Cody opened the second woman-owned law
firm in Outagamie County. At age 66, she was
elected president of the Outagamie County
Bar Association, the first woman to hold that
position. Cody retired from the legal profession
at age 75 and joined the Outagamie County
Board of Supervisors. She won subsequent
bids for reelection and served on the Legisla-
tive/Audit Committee until she resigned at the
age of 82. In addition, Cody served on the
Outagamie County Health and Human Serv-
ices Board.
Her contributions to the community are vast
and continue to be honored. In 2013, Cody
was honored as a Woman of Distinction by
the Mid-Day Women’s Alliance. She was pre-
sented with the Lifetime Achievement Award
by the Wisconsin Law Journal in 2015. In
2016, the Fox Cities Chamber of Commerce
inducted Cody into the Business Hall of Fame
for her success and influence as a business
leader.
Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to rise in
recognition of Cody Splitt’s 100th birthday. I
would like to thank Cody for her service in the
U.S. Navy and continued commitment to im-
proving the Fox Valley community. May she
have a happy and healthy birthday.

CONGRATULATING WILLIAM J.
NOONAN ON HIS RETIREMENT
HON. DINA TITUS
OF NEVADA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Ms. TITUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to con-
gratulate my dear friend, William J. Noonan,
on his well-deserved retirement. After a long
and successful career in government and the
gaming industry, the last 18 years of which he
spent at Boyd Gaming, Bill leaves Las Vegas
better than he found it. I am sad to see him
depart his official position but know he will
stay involved in our community.
After graduating from Missouri State and
subsequently receiving his Master’s in Public
Administration from the University of Kansas,
Bill spent years managing cities across this
country and guiding them through both tough
and exciting economic periods. Although gam-
ing was not widely legalized throughout the
country when Bill first landed in Las Vegas in
the 1990s, he sensed the tides turning and
worked with city leaders to prepare for its ex-
pansion.
It was important to Bill to foster strong rela-
tionships between the gaming industry and the
communities in which companies operated,
and he went above and beyond his profes-
sional duties to accomplish this. With his stra-
tegic thinking and amiable personality, Bill
made Boyd Gaming a better community part-
ner and Las Vegas a stronger and more pros-
perous community through his service as Vice
Chairman and Executive Board member of the
Nevada Resort Association.
I had the pleasure of hosting Bill as my
guest to the State of the Union one year. It is
difficult to find someone who enjoys politics as
much as Bill. But Bill has been so much more
than just an observer: Bill has run a casino;
dined with U.S. presidents; guided economic
development and philanthropy in Las Vegas
as Chair of the Las Vegas Metro Chamber of
Commerce and through the Las Vegas Global
Economic Alliance; served on the Board of the
Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority;
and helped unify our community after the hor-
rific events of 1 October.
He is well respected in the gaming industry
intentionally and has been recognized numer-
ous times for his leadership, including as
Gaming Professional of the Year. He has truly
left his mark on Las Vegas, and we are all in-
debted to him for it. I wish Bill and his wife,
Sylvia, all the best in their future endeavors.

COMMEMORATING MR. HENRY
RODRIGUEZ MARTINEZ, SR.
HON. MARC A. VEASEY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to commemorate Mr. Henry Rodriguez Mar-
tinez, Sr. of Dallas. Mr. Martinez was a father,
veteran and a local civil rights leader that was
committed to bettering our DFW communities
throughout his life of public service.
Mr. Martinez was son of West Dallas, and
spent his life making sure that communities of
color had a seat at the table. He was an early
pioneer in building Latino political power in our
community and was one of the loudest advo-
cates in the fight to guarantee better represen-
tation for all people of color on the Dallas City
council. I know he would be proud to see the
diversity we have on our city council today.
Mr. Martinez also worked to ensure the
safety of West Dallas and the greater DFW-
area. Martinez was an active member of the
Eagle Ford/Ledbetter Community of West Dal-
las throughout his life and as the president of
the Ledbetter Neighborhood Association
helped improve local transit across the com-
munity and improve the quality of life for those
that lived there.
My thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Mar-
tinez’s family and friends. West Dallas is los-
ing a fighter and advocate for their community.
His spirit and accomplishments are irreplace-
able, but we will always strive to emulate
them.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the 113th Anniversary and
95th General Convention of Alpha Phi Alpha
Fraternity, Inc. Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.
(AΦA) is the first African-American, intercolle-
giate Greek-lettered fraternity. It was initially a
literary and social studies club organized in
the 1905–1906 school year at Cornell Univer-
sity but later evolved into a fraternity with a
founding date of December 4, 1906. Its aims
are ‘‘Manly Deeds, Scholarship, and Love For
All Mankind,’’ and its motto is ‘‘First of All,
Servants of All, We Shall Transcend All.’’
Chapters were chartered at Howard Univer-
sity and Virginia Union University in 1907. The
fraternity now has over 290,000 members and
has been open to men of all races since 1945.
Currently, there are more than 730 active
chapters in the Americas, Africa, Europe, the
Caribbean, and Asia. It is the largest predomi-
nantly African-American fraternity and one of
the ten largest collegiate fraternities in the na-
tion.
Alpha Phi Alpha is a social organization with
a service organization mission and has pro-
vided leadership and service during the Great
Depression, both World Wars, and the Civil
Rights Movement. The fraternity has ad-
dressed social issues such as apartheid,
AIDS, urban housing, and other economic,
cultural, and political issues of interest to peo-
ple of color.
National programs and initiatives of the fra-
ternity include A Voteless People Is a Hope-
less People, My Brother’s Keeper, Go To High
School, Go To College, Project Alpha, and the
World Policy Council. It also conducts philan-
thropic programming initiatives with the March
of Dimes, Head Start, the Boy Scouts of
America, and Big Brothers Big Sisters of
America. Currently the fraternity is involved in
a vigorous civic engagement initiative aimed at
voter protection and a full census count for
people of color.
Members of this fraternity include many his-
torical civil rights leaders such as Martin Lu-
ther King Jr., NAACP founder W. E. B. Du
Bois. Other world-renowned members include
political activist Cornel West, musicians Duke
Ellington and Lionel Richie, NBA legend Walt
Frazier, Jamaican Prime Minister Norman
Manley, Olympic gold medalist Jesse Owens,
Justice Thurgood Marshall, Investor and
founder of Vista Equity Partners Robert F.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION
HON. KAREN BASS
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, I attempted to
vote in favor of H.R. 3239. Unfortunately, due
to a mechanical error during yesterday’s vote
on this bill, my vote was not recorded.
As a legislator, a medical professional, and
an advocate of humane treatment for all peo-
ple, I am proud to support this bill because it
will raise the minimum standards for medical
treatment of migrants and asylum seekers
seeking refuge at our southwestern border.
I went to the border to view the cir-
cumstances on the ground and what I saw
were inhumane conditions. Men, women, and
children should never be placed in cages.
In 2018 alone, there were nine migrant
deaths that occurred after an encounter with
Customs and Border Protection—including
seven-year-old Jakelin, who died of dehydra-
tion and shock; and eight-year-old Felipe, who
died from influenza while in the custody of
Customs and Border Protection.
In the first half of 2019, there have been ten
deaths, including a two-year-old who died from
pneumonia and a 16-year-old who died from
influenza.
All these deaths could have been pre-
vented. The tragic deaths of these children do
not go unrecognized and are an unfortunate
and disgraceful symptom of the inhumane
treatment occurring at our southwest border.
H.R. 3239, the Humanitarian Standards for
Individuals in Customs and Border Protection
Custody Act, introduced by Congressman
RAUL RUIZ, raises the bar on humanitarian
standards at our southern border.
Migrant children require protection from
harm, but we already know this from our own
personal experiences. Our children and grand-
children need pediatric health assessments
and appropriate medical attention. So do mi-
grant children.
Your child’s pediatrician needs the equip-
ment and medications for assessment, triage
and treatment. So do the health care providers
for migrant children. Migrant children escaping
dire situations deserve the same care for their
hygiene and health.
You wouldn’t allow your children or grand-
children’s safety, nutrition, health and hygiene
needs to go unmet because you know that
they can lead to illness and death—like the
deaths of the children who died after being de-
tained at the border.
We must do better. We must dig the bar out
of the ground for the humane and dignified
treatment of migrants and raise it up to, at
minimum, international levels, so that no more
deaths occur on our watch. I commend and
support my colleague, Congressman RUIZ, for
introduction and passage of this bill in the
House of Representatives.

THE SAFEGUARDING STUDENT
VETERANS ACT
HON. ELIJAH E. CUMMINGS
OF MARYLAND
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise to
discuss the Safeguarding Student Veterans
Act.
In recent years, we have seen a wave of
abrupt closures of colleges in Maryland and
around the country, particularly those oper-
ating for profit. When a college closes, stu-
dents are the ones that bear the burden and
are left asking ‘‘what’s next?’’
Students who have spent thousands of dol-
lars can just be left with credits they are often
not able to transfer. This leaves entire families
placed in financial limbo due to circumstances
of which the student was unaware.
In the last five years, close to a half million
students were impacted by closures of around
1,200 campuses. They were robbed of their
education and a chance to better themselves.
When these schools close, student veterans
using the GI Bill benefits they have earned
through their courageous service are dis-
proportionately impacted. Furthermore, many
for-profit schools have been found to target
veterans for enrollment with deceptive and
predatory practices.
Between 2014 and 2018, the closure of for-
profit colleges impacted almost 22,000 stu-
dents using the GI Bill.
In 2016, when ITT Technical Institute closed
its doors, about 7,000 of its 40,000 students
were on the GI Bill.
Last year, Education Corporation of America
suddenly ceased operations. Nearly 4,000 of
its 18,000 students were using the GI Bill.
In addition to harming veterans, these clos-
ings also leave taxpayers on the hook be-
cause the Department of Veterans Affairs has
to double the amount of funding it provides for
GI Bill beneficiaries when a school closes and
their credits do not transfer.
After serving our nation, veterans using their
GI Bill benefits should have faith that they will
be able to complete their degrees without their
schools suddenly closing.
We must do better for our veterans.
Our veterans have served our country, and
we must honor the sacrifices they made as
they transition back into civilian life and seek
to better themselves through education.
That is why I am introducing bipartisan leg-
islation to protect these student veterans. This
week I am introducing the Safeguarding Stu-
dent Veterans Act with Congressman Ted
Yoho of Florida. Our bill will increase coordi-
nation between the Department of Veterans
Affairs and the Department of Education, re-
quire the Department of Veterans Affairs to
better understand and track the risks that cer-
tain schools pose to veterans, and empower
veterans when deciding on which schools to
attend.
Under the bill, when the Department of Edu-
cation determines that any school, including
for-profits, are facing significant financial and
compliance issues, the Department of Edu-
cation would need to notify and coordinate
with the Department of Veterans Affairs.
The Department of Veterans Affairs would
then need to undertake a risk analysis for
these schools. The analysis would include in-
formation the Department of Veterans Affairs
receives from the Department of Education as
well as additional factors such as the volume
of student complaints, rates of Federal student
loan defaults by veterans, and veteran com-
pletion rates.
The Department of Veterans Affairs would
then notify veterans of the results of the risk
analysis and include the findings in the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs’ online GI Bill
Comparison Tool.
I am proud that our bill has wide-ranging
support, including from the American Legion,
Veterans Education Success, Vietnam Vet-
erans of America, and Maryland Attorney Gen-
eral Brian Frosh.
I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting
the Safeguarding Student Veterans Act. We
must do better to protect our student veterans.
