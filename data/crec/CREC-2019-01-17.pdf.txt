PRAYER
Dr. Barry C. Black, Chaplain, United
States Senate, Washington, D.C., of-
fered the following prayer:
O God, our way, our truth, and our
life, we worship You.
Quicken our consciences by Your ho-
liness, that we will find nourishment in
Your truth.
As this partial government shutdown
continues, help our lawmakers to open
their hearts to Your love and to sur-
render their desires to Your purposes.
Lord, in this tangled world, we are
conscious of our woeful inadequacies to
sit in the seats of judgment, to balance
the scales of justice, and to respond
with equity to the myriad calls of
human needs.
We need You, Eternal God, to crown
the deliberations of this Chamber with
Your wisdom to fit these challenging
times.
We pray in Your mighty Name.
Amen.

THE JOURNAL
The SPEAKER. The Chair has exam-
ined the Journal of the last day’s pro-
ceedings and announces to the House
her approval thereof.
Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-
nal stands approved.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker,
pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a
vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s ap-
proval of the Journal.
The SPEAKER. The question is on
the Speaker’s approval of the Journal.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I
object to the vote on the ground that a
quorum is not present and make the
point of order that a quorum is not
present.
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8,
rule XX, further proceedings on this
question will be postponed.
The point of no quorum is considered
withdrawn.
f
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The SPEAKER. Will the gentle-
woman from Washington (Ms.
DELBENE) come forward and lead the
House in the Pledge of Allegiance.
Ms. DELBENE led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to five requests for 1-minute
speeches on each side of the aisle.

DO THE RIGHT THING AND RE-
OPEN THE FEDERAL GOVERN-
MENT
(Mr. POCAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. POCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to ask my colleagues in Congress
to do the right thing and support the
Democrats’ efforts to reopen our Fed-
eral Government.
We are seeing devastating impacts on
800,000 Federal employees who serve us,
the contractors that work for us, and
the economy that impacts every person
in this country. Yet the President’s
petulant, adolescent approach to the
shutdown has been supported by my
colleagues through their inability to
support reopening government.
Responsible governments around the
world do not shut down, and leaders do
not take hostages and demand ransom.
Look, today the President is shutting
down the government over an ineffi-
cient and unnecessary wall. If we capit-
ulate, the next shutdown will be over
his desire to lift sanctions on the Rus-
sians. The next shutdown could be over
his desire to stop the Mueller inves-
tigation, and so on and so on.
This isn’t how the United States can
or should operate, yet the Republicans’
complicity in this petulant behavior
hurts our constituents and threatens
our economy.
Mr. President, reopen the govern-
ment before you further damage the
United States of America.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. PIN-
GREE). Members are reminded to re-
frain from engaging in personalities to-
ward the President.
f
RECOGNIZING RIDGWAY AREA
HIGH SCHOOL AS A NATIONAL
BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to con-
gratulate Ridgway Area High School
for being named a National Blue Rib-
bon School.
Since 1982, the U.S. Department of
Education has identified and cele-
brated excellence in education through
the Blue Ribbon Award.
Ridgway Area High School’s tradi-
tion of academic excellence is a testa-
ment to this rural community’s dedica-
tion to the importance of education.
Like many small communities, the
high school serves as a central hub in
Ridgway. Faculty and staff work dili-
gently to help each student reach their
fullest potential.
Ridgway Area High School knows
that families and community stake-
holders are vital to the educational
mission. They strongly value the idea
that students who are involved in
teams, groups, and community service

initiatives are those who grow habits
of engagement that lead to productive
citizenship. All graduating seniors are
required to have completed 50 hours of
community service in local nonprofit
organizations in the Ridgway commu-
nity in an effort to instill in all stu-
dents a sense of service above self.
Madam Speaker, I wholeheartedly
congratulate Ridgway Area High
School on this outstanding achieve-
ment.
f
END THE TRUMP SHUTDOWN AND
REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT
(Ms. DELBENE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, I rise
to call on the President and Senate Re-
publicans to reopen the government.
We are now on day 27 of the Trump
shutdown, and more and more families
are being harmed. 800,000 Federal work-
ers have been furloughed or are work-
ing without pay—workers from the
Forest Service, Coast Guard, Customs
and Border Patrol, and TSA. These
workers clock in every day to make
sure the rest of us are safe, and they
can’t count on a paycheck.
Federal employees aren’t the only
ones impacted. I recently met with a
small business in my district that
works on Federal contracts supporting
space exploration and research, a grow-
ing industry. Because of the shutdown,
they haven’t been paid for work they
have already done, forcing this small
business to lay off 20 percent of its
workforce last week. It never had to
happen.
Every day, this shutdown the Presi-
dent is so proud of hurts more families
and businesses. It must end.
f
RECOGNIZING THE YOUNG PEOPLE
OF THE DIOCESE OF SPRINGFIELD
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize the young people from my home
diocese in Springfield, Illinois, who
traveled to Washington, D.C., for the
46th annual March for Life tomorrow.
Each year, nearly 200 students from
throughout the Diocese of Springfield
and the 13th District come to our Na-
tion’s Capital to show their support for
choosing life. It is truly inspiring to
see so many—especially young people—
marching for life, and I am proud to
stand with them in their defense for
life.
Last year, I attended mass with these
students to pray for all unborn chil-
dren and for an end to abortion. Before
mass, I learned that, when the students
arrived in Washington, one of their
classmates, Ayden O’Malley, from
Nokomis, Illinois, suffered a serious
medical episode. Ayden passed away 5
days later here in Washington. Al-
though I never met her, I admire her
convictions and willingness to be a
voice for those who cannot speak for
themselves.
This year, we remember Ayden as
well as all unborn children whose lives
were cut short.
f
SHUT DOWN THIS SHUTDOWN
(Ms. ADAMS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today, on day 27 of the Trump shut-
down, to talk about the real-world im-
pacts on those in my congressional dis-
trict, ordinary Americans who hope
and pray for an end to this manufac-
tured crisis.
This week, I held a tele-townhall to
hear personal stories from my con-
stituents. I heard from an 80-year-old
grandmother who is worried sick about
what a long-term shutdown means to
her Medicare.
I heard from a TSA officer who strug-
gles to make ends meet on his $23,000
salary and wonders how he will ever
survive if he misses another paycheck.
I heard from folks who worry about
their tax refunds and their SNAP bene-
fits, their rental assistance and their
home loans. And I heard from people
who wonder how much longer will their
children be able to get a warm meal
when they get to school each day.
Madam Speaker, enough is enough. It
is time to stop the partisan games.
Most of all, it is time for the Senate
and the President to do their job and
shut down this shutdown.
f
FIRE SAFETY CONCERNS AT
WINTERGREEN RESORT
(Mr. RIGGLEMAN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Speaker,
today, I rise to speak about a pressing
local safety concern in my home coun-
ty of Nelson. Wintergreen Resort is fac-
ing major fire safety issues.
Last week, I spoke with the local fire
chief, who pointed out that having only
one exit from the Wintergreen Resort
creates the potential for a major public
safety crisis. In the case of an emer-
gency, such as a fire blocking the main
exit, there would be no way to leave
the resort.
I have called the National Park Serv-
ice and asked that they help me miti-
gate this situation by allowing a sec-
ondary exit that will allow people to go
from the resort, through the national
park, and to the Blue Ridge Parkway
in the case of a fire or emergency. This
simple step, 450 feet, would safeguard
the community against a potential dis-
aster.
Government, when necessary, should
be here to assist, not interfere. Guide-
lines that don’t make sense need to be
changed so that common sense pre-
vails.
GOOD PUBLIC POLICY DEPENDS
ON ACCURATE DATA
(Mr. PANETTA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker,
good public policy depends on thorough
and accurate data. That is why this
week’s ruling by District Judge Jesse
Furman to block the administration
from adding a citizenship question to
the 2020 Census is so important to my
district on the central coast and to our
country.
The 2020 Census is more than just
about where people live. It dictates
how our many, many boundaries are
drawn.
The Census is enshrined in our Con-
stitution, and it is a bedrock responsi-
bility of our government. But adding a
citizenship question to the Census with
this administration in charge may
scare people from actually answering
the questions, and that could result in
inaccuracies that jeopardize the dis-
bursement of over $700 billion in fund-
ing for essential services in our com-
munities like roads, schools, and even
nutrition assistance programs.
This decision by the Federal judge is
very good news, but we must continue
to work to live up to our responsibil-
ities under the American Constitution,
and we can do that with a 2020 Census
that depicts a precise population count
through accurate data, adequate area
offices, and appropriate and acceptable
questions that everybody in all com-
munities can answer.
f
BORDER SECURITY
(Mr. YOHO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I would
like to discuss border security, not as
viewed by Washington elites, but how
it is viewed by average Americans.
Democratic leaders and the media
will tell you that most Americans
don’t support President Trump’s pro-
posed southern border wall. They will
tell you that a border wall is not need-
ed; it is immoral; it won’t fix the coun-
try’s illegal immigration problem.
I currently represent Florida’s Third
Congressional District, and here I have
a picture of my district’s public cre-
ative space, the 34th Street graffiti
wall that is well known in Gainesville.
This wall is used by local organizations
to express their thoughts on issues and
display information for community
events.
Recently, local residents painted
their support of President Trump’s pro-
posed wall for all passersby to see. The
wall reads: ‘‘Keep the government
shutdown until the wall is funded. Call
Congress. We the people demand Con-
gress fund and build the wall now.’’
It is a great example of everyday
Americans voicing their support for
what matters most to them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H683
January 17, 2019
It is clear that Americans do support
President Trump’s security stance, de-
spite exaggerated reports by the media
and my colleagues on the other side.
I have heard from hundreds of my
constituents who are in support of the
wall. Their voices have been heard, and
I will remain strong for border security
and protecting this Nation.

SHUTDOWN
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I
rise to implore the President to stop
holding Federal workers hostage and
immediately end this shutdown.
I think every day of the TSA agent I
recently spoke with at the airport. She
is now working without pay, a young
single mother raising her 15-year-old
daughter. She told me she is really
struggling to make ends meet without
her paycheck. Her story is not unique.
A constituent from Mundelein shared
that she doesn’t know how she will pay
her bills, including her mortgage, and
has had to borrow money from her fam-
ily.
Another constituent, a Federal em-
ployee in Round Lake, has been work-
ing without pay. He wrote: ‘‘Why are
we a bargaining tool for something be-
yond our control?’’
Why indeed, Mr. President?
We may disagree on the best way to
secure our border, but we can all agree
that the good women and men working
on our Nation’s behalf should be paid
for their work—the TSA and FAA
workers keeping our skies safe, the
FDA workers keeping our food safe,
and the Coast Guard protecting our
borders.
Do the responsible thing: reopen our
government, and then let’s have a ro-
bust, honest debate about how to se-
cure our borders.

PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION
OF H.J. RES. 28, FURTHER ADDI-
TIONAL CONTINUING APPRO-
PRIATIONS ACT, 2019, AND PRO-
VIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF
MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE
RULES
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, by
direction of the Committee on Rules, I
call up House Resolution 52 and ask for
its immediate consideration.
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 52
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to consider in the
House the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 28)
making further continuing appropriations
for fiscal year 2019, and for other purposes.
All points of order against consideration of
the joint resolution are waived. The joint
resolution shall be considered as read. All
points of order against provisions in the
joint resolution are waived. The previous
question shall be considered as ordered on
the joint resolution and on any amendment
thereto to final passage without intervening
motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally
divided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on
Appropriations or their respective designees;
and (2) one motion to recommit.
SEC. 2. It shall be in order at any time
through the legislative day of January 25,
2019, for the Speaker to entertain motions
that the House suspend the rules as though
under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or
her designee shall consult with the Minority
Leader or his designee on the designation of
any matter for consideration pursuant to
this section.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Pennsylvania is recog-
nized for 1 hour.
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, for
the purpose of debate only, I yield the
customary 30 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO),
pending which I yield myself such time
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania?
There was no objection.
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, on
Wednesday, the Rules Committee met
and reported a rule, House Resolution
52, providing for consideration of H.J.
Res. 28, the Further Additional Con-
tinuing Appropriations Act of 2019 to
fund the government until February 28.
The rule provides for consideration of
the legislation under a closed rule. The
rule provides 1 hour of debate equally
divided and controlled by the chair and
ranking member of the Committee on
Appropriations. Additionally, the rule
provides suspension authority through
the legislative day of January 25, 2019.
Madam Speaker, we are in day 27 of
this government shutdown, the longest
government shutdown in our Nation’s
history.
Nearly 800,000 Federal employees
have now missed a paycheck since the
shutdown began. Some estimates say
those employees have lost an average
of $5,000 each so far.
These hardworking Americans are
law enforcement officers and National
Park Service, EPA, FDA, and IRS em-
ployees, and so many others in dedi-
cated Federal service whose families
are needlessly suffering. These employ-
ees are either furloughed or being
forced to work without pay. This is not
an acceptable way to govern.
I may not have been a Member of this
body as long as some people here, but I
don’t think there is a single Member,
Democrat or Republican, who doesn’t
care about securing our border, but it
is foolish to think that keeping our
government shut down will in any way
help secure the border.
You know what Border Patrol and
Coast Guard members want more than
a wall? They want their paychecks to
come on time.
Democrats have made it clear, we are
more than willing to come to the table
to talk about sensible border security,
but the first step has to be to reopen
the government and get our govern-
ment back to functioning.
This majority has already voted to
open the government seven times, with
support from across the aisle. But Sen-
ate Majority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL
has yet to act on any of these bipar-
tisan pieces of legislation, the same
legislation, I might add, that has al-
ready passed the Senate.
There are more than 100 freshmen
Members of this body, comprising over
20 percent of the House, who have
never worked in a functioning Federal
Government due to the Senate’s inac-
tion. All of our constituents, both Re-
publican and Democrat, are suffering
because of that failure to act.
Let me share with you the traumatic
impact of the shutdown on my con-
stituents and Americans across the
country.
Jennifer, the wife of a Coast Guard
gunner’s mate, wrote to my office to
detail the hardships her family is fac-
ing. Her husband has served in the
Coast Guard for 19 years. They are used
to stressful deployments, and her chil-
dren are proud of their father’s service.
But now Jennifer has new hardships to
face: how to feed her family on only
her income, how she could make the
holidays special while not knowing
when her husband’s next paycheck
would come, and how to shield her kids
from her constant worry over the ab-
sence of that income.
This is an embarrassment. Too many
Federal workers were already living
paycheck to paycheck before those
paychecks stopped. Having to put a
mortgage payment on a credit card,
deal with an eviction notice, or plead
with a bank to delay a student loan
payment should not be the reality
forced upon hardworking Federal em-
ployees.
The debts these workers incur during
the shutdown will follow them long
after the government is reopened. The
hits to their savings accounts and
marks on their credit scores will serve
as painful reminders that they are rep-
resented by a government that will put
them in harm’s way over a policy dis-
pute.
Fran, a newlywed with a premature
baby who spent more than 3 weeks in
the NICU, has been without an income
since her husband’s paychecks stopped
coming. Their child requires an expen-
sive special formula due to his pre-
mature birth, and her husband is now
being asked to work overtime without
pay.
The fear and anguish in these mes-
sages from our neighbors is palpable. It
should resonate with every Member of
this body. These stories should keep all
of us up at night. If we didn’t come to
Washington to serve these dedicated
and hardworking Americans, then just
who are we here to serve?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H684 January 17, 2019
When the government does eventu-
ally reopen, fortunately, many of these
Federal employees will receive back-
pay, but the plight of Federal contrac-
tors is worse. The term ‘‘Federal con-
tractors’’ can conjure up an image of
highly paid executives or CEOs of pri-
vate detention facilities, but they are
not the real ones harmed by the shut-
down.
Federal contractors are generally
small businesses, cleaners, builders,
food service workers, and tech support
workers. They are our neighbors who
rely on these contracts to make their
rent or pay their employees or con-
tribute to our local economies.
The callousness with which these
Federal contractors are being treated
is repulsive. They and their families
deserve so much better. The American
people deserve so much better.
The longer the Senate Republicans
keep our government shut down, the
worse things will get.
The Small Business Administration
has already stopped approving loan as-
sistance and guarantee applications
from commercial banks and small busi-
nesses, programs that are critical to
the health of local economies.
Security lines at the airports are
long, and they will get longer. TSA has
already been forced to close security
lanes at major airports across the
country. This is not because the hard-
working men and women of the TSA do
not want to keep our skies and our pas-
sengers safe, but because they have
been forced to take second jobs to pay
the rent or look after their children at
home because they cannot afford
childcare. Without a paycheck, some
cannot afford gas or carfare to get to
work at all.
Just a few days ago, I met with the
air traffic controllers from my district.
They shared that not only is the shut-
down impacting their current work-
force, but it is drastically impacting
their recruiting efforts to hire and
train new employees for this work-
force. Can we blame people for being
fearful of taking a job that hinges on
the Federal Government’s
functionality, given what we have seen
during this shutdown?
A National Air Traffic Controllers
Association official warned recently
that if the shutdown continues to drag
on, there may not be any air traffic
controllers left working.
Let me pause to make those state-
ments abundantly clear. This shutdown
is making us less safe. If it continues
much longer, there will not be enough
employees on duty to make sure pas-
sengers are safe to board a plane, not
enough employees left to make sure
planes are safe to land, and not enough
employees to direct air traffic in our
skies.
If you think you are insulated from
the effects of a government shutdown
because you are not a Federal em-
ployee, you are wrong.
What I fear this administration and
Republican leadership in the Senate
have forgotten is that this is the peo-
ple’s House. We have an obligation to
work for them. Refusing to uphold that
commitment, that promise, is a slap in
the face to the American people.
Before I conclude, let me share with
you one final story of how the shut-
down is harming American families.
Jessica from my district is a mother
of six with a special needs child. Her
husband is Active Duty Coast Guard.
She has been forced to tell her children
they can’t have seconds at dinner, be-
cause she doesn’t know if she will have
enough food to last the week. Her
daughter has an ultrasound coming up,
and she is unsure if she can afford the
specialist copay.
She writes that she and her husband
supported President Trump, but that
after this, she does not see ‘‘how we
could support someone so out of touch
and willing to damage so many people
in order to save his own face.’’
Jessica ended her message by saying
that they are prepared to stand strong,
but she is also prepared to stand at the
corner of an intersection with a card-
board sign if that is what she has to do
to feed her children.
This is not the America I was raised
in.
Let’s end the shutdown today and get
our country back on track.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I
thank Representative SCANLON from
Pennsylvania for yielding me the cus-
tomary 30 minutes, and I yield myself
as much time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I agree with Rep-
resentative SCANLON. I want to open
the government. Republicans want to
open the government. Democrats want
to open the government. So I respect-
fully ask House and Senate Democrats
to stop holding our Federal workers
hostage.
You know, on December 20, I voted
for and Republicans voted for in the
House a bill right here, standing right
here on December 20, that would have
kept the government open, and then we
would not have had any of these discus-
sions or need for these bills, because
the government would still be open.
Unfortunately, not one Democrat
Member of the House voted for it.
I, too, have Federal workers in my
district who are hurting, these great
men and women who work hard each
and every day of their life, single
mothers who are waiting for their pay-
check. So I call on my colleagues
across the aisle to please come to the
negotiating table.
I believe the number one rule in Ne-
gotiations 101 is you have to show up.
Repeatedly, we have seen the Repub-
licans and the President request the
Democrat leadership to come and nego-
tiate, give a counteroffer. They refuse
to show up.
I say, if the House Republicans al-
ready passed a bill that would have
kept the government open and now we
are at this impasse, but the Democrat
leadership refuses to come to even a
negotiating table or a counteroffer, I
just don’t know what to say.
Well, Madam Speaker, once again, we
have returned to the House floor to
consider yet another short-term spend-
ing bill that once again is most likely
going nowhere. For what is now the
fourth time in 3 weeks, we have re-
turned to the House floor on a rule to
consider an appropriations bill as part
of the majority’s efforts to fund the
government without working with
President Trump.
Unfortunately, we think this effort is
just as shortsighted as the previous
bills over the last couple of weeks, and
today’s rule is again destined to ignore
the fundamental realities at issue.
But first, as I said before, let’s take
a quick look at how we got to this
point.
On December 20, the House of Rep-
resentatives passed a bill that would
have funded the government and pre-
vented the shutdown. It included a con-
tinuing resolution through February 8.
It included disaster relief and funding
for border security that the Democrats
say they want, but are not listening to
our own law enforcement on the border
on their recommendations. That was a
bill the majority of the Senate sup-
ported and the President said he would
sign.
b 0930
Unfortunately, as we all know, the
Senate refused to take up the House
measure, mostly because of their 60-
vote rule, where they need Democrats
to get on board, and parts of the gov-
ernment shut down when appropria-
tions lapsed. Again, not one single
Democrat in the House voted for this
bill, which would have avoided this
whole, entire partial government shut-
down.
On January 3, when the new Congress
was sworn in, the House took up a con-
tinuing resolution through February 8,
only this time swept clean of essential
disaster relief funding or funding for
border security. To date, the Senate, as
we know, has refused to take up this
measure, and the President has said he
would not sign it because it doesn’t
have additional money for border secu-
rity.
Last week, then again, the House
took up four more spending bills, that
covered four of the outstanding seven
appropriations titles. Unfortunately,
like the week prior, these bills also did
not include funding for border security.
Even more unfortunately, these bills
were ones that were produced by the
Senate alone during the last Congress,
and that did not even reflect any work
by, or input from, the House of Rep-
resentatives. Just as publicly stated
the Senate has not taken up any of
these bills during this Congress and has
no plans to take this one up either.
On Tuesday, the majority put up yet
another continuing resolution. This
one a suspension bill, to fund the gov-
ernment through February 1, but, yet

again, omitting any funding for border
security, which is the key ingredient to
get negotiations done. That bill failed
to reach the two-thirds threshold to
pass under suspension of the rules.
And then, yes, yesterday, the House
took up a supplemental disaster appro-
priations bill that was intended only to
provide just over $12 billion in nec-
essary disaster relief for affected com-
munities. This was a bipartisan bill.
We could have passed it out of here.
But instead of bringing up this bipar-
tisan disaster relief bill to the floor,
the majority chose to play politics
once again and decided at the last
minute to attach yet another con-
tinuing resolution to this bill, again,
without any border security funding,
and, again, to fund the government
through February 8. That bill passed
the House yesterday, yet there is no
sign that the Senate ever has any in-
tention of taking that bill up. In any
event, the President has made it clear,
and I believe the American public has
made it clear, that we want border se-
curity.
And that brings us to today. I have to
tell you, I am running out of ways to
describe what the majority is doing,
but I imagine the Speaker knows where
I am going with this. Once again, the
majority is bringing up yet another
continuing resolution—this one goes to
February 28—and, again, with no fund-
ing for border security. And yet again,
it is clear that if we pass this bill, the
Senate will not consider it and the
President will not sign it because it
does not include funding for border se-
curity.
We now see the common thread in all
the majority is doing: bringing up bills
again and again and again, to fund the
government, without dealing with the
fundamental problem. All of these re-
peated continuing resolutions are the
same. Only the date has changed. All of
them fail to fund border security,
which Americans have told us again
and again they want and need. And all
of them are continued avoidance of
what needs to happen in order to end
this shutdown: real, sincere negotia-
tions with the Senate and the Presi-
dent over border security.
I feel that this is an exercise in futil-
ity. The majority is failing to acknowl-
edge the crisis happening at our south-
ern border. As you know, I am a Mem-
ber from Arizona, a border State. When
will the Democrats get serious about
ending this government shutdown and
come to the negotiating table to work
out a deal that has a real chance of
being signed into law?
Listen, I know that border security is
a crisis. The other night on TV, when
Speaker PELOSI and CHUCK SCHUMER
said it is a manufactured crisis, I can
tell you firsthand, that is not accurate.
We do have a crisis on the border, and
we need to fix it. I have been to the
border. I have been to the border sev-
eral times. I recently visited the
United States-Mexico border in
Nogales, Arizona, where I met with
Customs and Border Protection agents.
The crisis we are dealing with at the
border is not just illegal immigration,
they said. There is illicit drugs flowing
through our borders, which are killing
our children and adults, human traf-
ficking, and they told us that dan-
gerous cartels are using our loose im-
migration laws to exploit the women
and children, having them travel thou-
sands of miles.
Do you know that Doctors Without
Borders say that, I believe one in three
of these women have been sexually
abused? This is unconscionable. We
need border security. And it is the law
enforcement, the Customs and Border
Protection, that have said repeatedly,
have told me personally, yes; part of
the solution is a border fence.
In 2006, Democrats supported a bor-
der fence. CHUCK SCHUMER and then-
Senators Barack Obama and Hillary
Clinton funded $52 billion for 700 miles
of fencing. Now the President is asking
for $5.7 billion. That is only 1/10th of 1
percent of the Federal budget. And, un-
fortunately, because of their refusal to
add this to any bills, it has shut down
the government.
This rule before us today is just an-
other ploy. Democrats are refusing to
negotiate and refusing to deal with this
national security issue. Please, let’s
stop these games and pass a real bill
that funds border security, that opens
the government, that funds disaster re-
lief, send it to the Senate, and have it
signed into law.
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to
the rule, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I understand the
frustration of the gentlewoman from
Arizona with the lack of progress in
ending this shutdown, but I would sug-
gest that her frustration is mis-
directed.
The House has sent seven bills to end
the shutdown to the Senate, and the
Senate leadership has refused to enter-
tain any of them or bring them to a
vote: #whereismitch.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from Maine (Mr. GOLD-
EN).
Mr. GOLDEN. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding me
the time.
Madam Speaker, this shutdown has
been brutal on working people across
the country. Many of them are my con-
stituents, and I came down here to let
their voices be heard.
Back home, a Border Patrol agent
from my district said about all of us
here in the House, in the White House,
in the Senate: ‘‘I blame all of you for
the financial and emotional damage
you are causing to the very people
tasked with protecting your Nation
and your homeland, but ultimately,
this falls on the White House.’’
Suzette from my district, her hus-
band is an essential Federal employee
working without pay. She asked me,
‘‘to bring sensibility to this senseless
power struggle that is currently going
on. The Democrats,’’ she says—and she
is a Democrat, by the way—‘‘need to
back down from their ‘must punish
Trump and deny him everything’
stance and the Republicans need to get
some control over the ill-equipped man
who is running our country.’’
Another Federal employee from Mil-
ford, Maine, tells me: ‘‘I am very con-
cerned with the furlough, lack of nego-
tiations, and lack of pay. I do not know
who is right or wrong. I just want to
get back to work, complete my job, and
receive my pay.’’
We owe these people a solution that
gets them back to work and gets them
paid. I can only imagine that, back
home, people are amazed to hear the
ways in which both sides are right now
talking past each other. I think it is
wonderful that we expressed, on both
sides of the aisle this morning, a desire
to reopen the government and to se-
cure our borders.
I would like to point out that the CR
that will be voted on today does have
border security funding: over $1 billion
in new funding for new border security.
I know that the Republicans say that
they want to reopen government and
secure our borders, I also know that
my party has said the same, so let’s do
it.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the rule, support the
CR today, let’s reopen government,
let’s put people back to work, let them
work. They are public servants. They
want to serve the people. Let’s start se-
curing our border. And with those
extra billion dollars we can also move
on to a more robust debate about bor-
der security that I look forward to.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
5 minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. BIGGS), my good friend.
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding me time
to speak on this important issue.
Madam Speaker, I oppose this rule. I
think we are talking past each other,
as the previous gentleman from Maine
just indicated. We want the govern-
ment to reopen, but we want some-
thing called border security. I am told
that this bill has $1 billion in it for bor-
der security, but we are not going to
build a wall.
Now, here is the thing that happens.
Down in Arizona, where we live—we
don’t live 2,000 miles away from that
southern border where the immigration
problem is that the illegal border
crossings are monumental—we actu-
ally see the humanitarian crisis. That
crisis exists when people, who are com-
ing to America, they don’t go through
the ports of entry, they are going be-
tween the ports of entry, in some of the
most rugged land and terrain in the
world, coming down from the Sierra
Madres in northern Mexico in the sum-
mertime, blazing heat of 120 degrees or
more; in the winter time, the evenings
cool down to the 20s.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H686 January 17, 2019
I saw people, just yesterday, being
shown on the news, who are getting
ready to try to make this trek. They
are carrying plastic grocery bags with
their supplies. They are dressed cas-
ually. They have no comprehension of
the danger that they are bringing to
themselves when they are coming
across. It is a humanitarian crisis. Do
you know what a border wall would do?
It would provide a deterrent.
In the San Diego-San Ysidro port of
entry, when that border wall was cre-
ated, crossings declined almost 90 per-
cent. It forced people to a different
place. They began crossing away from
the ports of entry at San Diego over to
Arizona and Texas. So we built a wall
around the Yuma port of entry. Do you
know what happened? Those crossings
decreased 75 to 80 percent. They moved
on to more dangerous places in the
desert, down towards Nogales, between
Nogales and South Bisbee, between
Naco and the Douglas port of entry.
More than 100 individual’s bodies were
found last year trying to enter. It is a
humanitarian crisis.
The opioids that come across the
southern border: 141 tons of heroin
seized coming across the southern bor-
der last year; 140 tons of cocaine seized
coming across the southern border.
When I hear people say border secu-
rity, they start talking about drones
and unmanned aerial vehicles and sen-
sors and cameras. Guess what? That
does not deter anyone. We get to watch
the videos of people coming across. But
do you know what a wall does? It chan-
nelizes people. It forces them to go to
places where we can interdict them. We
provide hundreds of millions of dollars
of humanitarian aid to people who are
risking their lives trying to enter this
country.
If it wasn’t so serious, I would find it
laughable to hear folks say, ‘‘We are
putting $1 billion into this as border se-
curity,’’ because they don’t want a po-
litical victory for President Trump. It
is not about political victories. It is
about national security, it is about hu-
manitarian concern, and you are not
going to get a better bang for your
buck than to build a border wall.
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
b 0945
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
5 minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. PERRY), my good friend.
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, folks
in the audience, and folks that are
watching this on TV, this is all the-
ater. This is all just political theater.
Everybody knows. I know. My good
friends on the other side of the aisle
know that this isn’t going to solve any-
thing. This is not a solution.
If we were serious about solving this,
we wouldn’t be voting on another bill
here that doesn’t fix anything, that is
never going to be moved through the
Senate, that is never going to be signed
by the President.
If we were interested in opening the
Federal Government, we would be ne-
gotiating. We would be talking about
what our differences are about border
security.
Remember, this is a bill that includes
the funding for border security. That is
why we have this partial shutdown, be-
cause we have a disagreement about
border security. And we are trying to
work it out, but we can’t work it out
just by running the same bills that
don’t do anything and that are never
going to move through the Senate and
aren’t going to be signed by the Presi-
dent.
It is time to get serious.
Last year, this government was shut
down for a few days over amnesty. Now
it is shut down because the other side
doesn’t want to talk about border secu-
rity. You put amnesty and the lack of
border security together, and that is
open borders. That is completely open
borders.
Just on the news, if you were watch-
ing the last couple days, more caravans
heading north out of Central America
through Mexico to the United States
border. That is what is happening right
now while our Border Patrol agents are
out there working but not being paid.
Here come these folks. We don’t
know what their circumstances are. I
am sure there are a lot of fine people in
there. I am sure there are children in
there, and the horrors that they are
going to suffer on this trek north up
through the desert in these points be-
tween the points of entry.
Madam Speaker, the most recent
numbers out of Homeland Security in
November, 51,000 people—that is the
ones we caught—51,000 people came
across the border between the ports of
entry.
If they were coming to the ports of
entry, this wouldn’t be half of a prob-
lem, but the problem is they are com-
ing between the ports of entry. That is
one month, 51,000. And those are the
ones we caught. We don’t have any idea
how many other ones made it through.
And yet some folks are saying: Well,
we are going to give you an extra bil-
lion dollars to fix this problem.
It is not an extra billion. It is the
same billion, and it is to fix problems
at the ports of entry.
Madam Speaker, the problem is be-
tween the ports of entry and the ports
of entry. But we are not going to do
anything about the ports of entry. The
billion dollars we are talking about is
to muddle around and maintain things
at the ports of entry but do nothing be-
tween the ports of entry, nothing at
all. That is the status quo.
That is why we are in this argument,
because we are saying we cannot with-
stand, we cannot maintain the status
quo of 51,000 people a month coming il-
legally across our border and do noth-
ing.
We are pleading with the other side:
Please, let’s do something. Let’s do
something different than the status
quo, because the status quo gives us
51,000 people coming illegally across
the border.
And they are saying: Well, we are
just going to run the same bill to open
the government and do nothing.
We cannot abide that. The American
people cannot abide that.
People are working, Madam Speaker,
without being paid while people pour
across our border, and we are expecting
them to stop them. They don’t have
the resources because we are not pro-
viding them.
It is time to end this needless show of
work. We are here working, right? We
are all here working. We are not doing
anything to solve the problem.
What it is going to take is somebody
to sit down at the table and say,
‘‘Look. See here. This is what I think
the issue is,’’ and find some solution
somewhere in the middle. But you
can’t do that if you are not willing to
have a discussion.
We are asking to have a discussion so
we can get past this, so people can get
paid and the American people can be
assured that their government is secur-
ing their border, their property, their
country, and stopping all these illegal
immigrants from coming in; and mak-
ing sure that, if they are going to come
in—and we are a country of immi-
grants.
My grandmother, my great-grand-
mother came here from Colombia,
South America, with the shirts on
their backs. They came through Ellis
Island because we had a process. We are
all immigrants, and we welcome immi-
grants more than any other country on
the planet, but we want you to come
legally.
We have a process. We don’t want
you to just pour across the border into
our country with gang-related vio-
lence, with fentanyl, with opioids that
are killing people in our own commu-
nities, all these drugs and crimes and
violence. We are asking you to come to
the ports of entry and quit pouring in
between the ports of entry. But our
laws now invite them to do that, which
is why they are coming.
So I just beseech you, Madam Speak-
er—and I thank you for your indul-
gence and for your time—let’s quit this
show. Let’s quit this charade. Let’s
quit this theater. Let’s get serious for
the people who are working, for the
American people who expect more, and
get down to negotiation, come to a so-
lution, and move on with things, the
important things that plague our Na-
tion.
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I am
surprised to hear my colleague talk
about political theater. We have a re-
ality-show President in the White
House who is ignoring the real lives
impacted by the shutdown, all to try to
make another made-for-TV moment to
please his rightwing base and radio
pundits. Government isn’t a game.
Real lives are at stake, and we need to
reopen the government.
Madam Speaker, may I inquire if the
gentlewoman has any remaining speak-
ers. If not, I am prepared to close, and
I reserve the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H687
January 17, 2019
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I am
prepared to close as well, and I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Madam Speaker, in closing, this is
the fourth time we have deliberated on
this floor, in the last 3 weeks, on the
exact same type of package.
The date keeps changing—sometimes
it is February 1; sometimes it is Feb-
ruary 8; sometimes it is February 28—
but it is all the same. None of them in-
clude funding for border security. It is
the fourth time that the same result
will ensue. The House of Representa-
tives is in a perpetual cycle of Ground-
hog Day that we cannot seem to es-
cape.
Representative SCANLON and I serve,
of course, on the Rules Committee to-
gether, and it is Groundhog Day. We
just say the same things each and
every day. Really, let’s get to the nego-
tiating table, and, really, let’s get
something done.
The majority seems to be insistent
on reviewing these same appropriations
packages again and again, fully know-
ing that the Senate has made clear
they will not take up these bills be-
cause there is no border security in
them.
Finally, Madam Speaker, I would be
remiss if I did not mention that this
bill is again coming to the floor under
a closed rule. Of the eight bills the
House has considered under a rule this
Congress, seven have been closed, with
no opportunity for Members to present
new ideas and new amendments.
Now, I know that Chairman MCGOV-
ERN has assured us he wants a more
open process, and I believe he is sincere
in his assurance. We saw a more open
process on the disaster supplemental
bill we considered earlier this week,
which has so far been the outlier of
this Congress, with 15 amendments
made in order on a structured rule. I
look forward to considering more rules
that have a more open process than the
one we are considering today.
Madam Speaker, I urge ‘‘no’’ on the
previous question, ‘‘no’’ on the under-
lying measure, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Madam Speaker, I don’t know when
this shutdown will end, but I know that
Democrats and all the Republicans who
are serious about getting Federal em-
ployees back to work will vote in favor
of this rule and the underlying resolu-
tion.
I am heartened by my colleagues
from across the aisle who have already
voted to reopen the government, and I
am hopeful that even more will join us
this time around.
No serious person can claim that any
Member of this House is against border
security. Not only have we sworn an
oath to protect and defend this coun-
try, but we have voted repeatedly to
fund billions of dollars in border secu-
rity appropriations.
The discussion about the best meth-
ods for protecting our border is a valid
policy question that should be debated
thoughtfully and deliberately by both
sides of the aisle, not used as a vehicle
for the President to fulfill a campaign
promise at the expense of American
families.
It cannot be overstated: this is the
longest government shutdown in his-
tory. The House has done its job. We
have passed bills to reopen the govern-
ment on bipartisan votes and will con-
tinue to do so for as long as it takes.
We have committed to working on
solutions to border security once the
government is opened back up. The
votes are there in the Senate. They
have already shown that. And given
the chance, I am sure they would show
it again.
Why won’t Senator MCCONNELL bring
to the floor any one of the House-
passed bills to open the government?
I will end by saying this: Senator
MCCONNELL, do the right thing for
working families in your State, in my
State, and across the country. Hold a
vote to open the government.
Let’s end the pain American families
and businesses are feeling from the
shutdown and get to work on making
this country a better place for all.
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote
on the rule and the previous question.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time, and I move the pre-
vious question on the resolution.
The previous question was ordered.

f
FURTHER ADDITIONAL CON-
TINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT,
2019
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, pursuant
to House Resolution 52, I call up the
joint resolution (H.J. Res. 28) making
further continuing appropriations for
fiscal year 2019, and for other purposes,
and ask for its immediate consider-
ation.
The Clerk read the title of the joint
resolution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
BUTTERFIELD). Pursuant to House Res-
olution 52, the joint resolution is con-
sidered read.
The text of the joint resolution is as
follows:
H.J. RES. 28
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled, That the Continuing Ap-
propriations Act, 2019 (division C of Public
Law 115–245) is further amended by striking
the date specified in section 105(3) and insert-
ing ‘‘February 28, 2019’’.
This joint resolution may be cited as the
‘‘Further Additional Continuing Appropria-
tions Act, 2019’’.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY)
and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.
GRANGER) each will control 30 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York.
b 1045
GENERAL LEAVE
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the measure under
consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Today is the 27th day of the Trump
shutdown, the longest government
shutdown in American history.
Hardworking public servants are see-
ing their financial security jeopard-
ized. Small businesses are being frozen
out of critical contracting and loan
programs. Businesses of all sizes are
being hurt by delayed regulatory ap-
provals and a lack of government data.
Farmers are unable to access vital Fed-
eral services. Our national parks are
being vandalized and filling up with
garbage. Critical environmental in-
spections to protect families and com-
munities have stopped. Lines at air-
ports are swelling, as many TSA work-
ers can’t afford to work without pay.
Mr. Speaker, this is unacceptable.
But, unfortunately, we heard yesterday
in this very House that Republicans
think reopening the government is a
poison pill. Reopening the government
is a poison pill? Frankly, that, my
friends, is unbelievable.
We can and we must do better, which
is why House Democrats are bringing
up our ninth piece of legislation to re-
open the government and end the
Trump shutdown.
The continuing resolution would pro-
vide an additional option for President
Trump and Senate Republicans to take
‘‘yes’’ for an answer and end the shut-
down. It would reopen the government
through February 28, providing time
for Congress to come to a full-year
agreement without further jeopard-
izing vital services or the pay of Fed-
eral employees.
The order of business, Mr. Speaker,
should be simple: Reopen the govern-
ment, pay Federal employees, and then
negotiate on border security and immi-
gration policy.
It is long past time for my colleagues
across the aisle and across the Capitol
to come to their senses and end this
shutdown.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this legislation and reopen the
government through February 28.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.J. Res. 28.
I support the goal of reopening the
government. There are many critical
programs that are on pause that are
important to my constituents, as they
are to all of us.
This prolonged shutdown has been
particularly hard for Federal employ-
ees like our TSA screeners, Border Pa-
trol agents, Coast Guard defenders, and
air traffic controllers. Like all of us,
these workers have families and bills
to pay. It is vital that we come to an
agreement, and soon.
Unfortunately, the bill we are consid-
ering today will not restart those pro-
grams or help our districts. That is be-
cause it is not a comprehensive solu-
tion to resolve the government shut-
down and fully address the security
and humanitarian crisis we face on our
southern border.
Criminals, terrorists, and drugs are
flooding our shores. Tens of thousands
of children, many of them without
their parents, make the dangerous trip
to the United States every year.
I have been to the border and to Cen-
tral America, and I have heard the
heartbreaking stories. I have looked in
the faces of those mothers and chil-
dren.
This situation is unacceptable, and it
must be addressed for the safety and
security of Americans and those com-
ing to the border. We can and must do
better.
Mr. Speaker, again, I share the con-
cern that parts of the government re-
main closed and employees are not yet
being paid, but moving this bill across
the floor will not help those employees.
To put it simply, that is not a bipar-
tisan consensus.
I hope Members on the other side of
the aisle will come back to the negoti-
ating table and work with Republicans
in the House, the Senate, and the
White House to find a compromise that
will address the crisis on the border
and reopen the government.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LEE), an outstanding senior
member of the Appropriations Com-
mittee.
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker,
once again, I thank the gentlewoman
for yielding and for her tremendous
leadership on so many issues.
I rise today in strong support of H.J.
Res. 28, this continuing resolution bill
to reopen the government through Feb-
ruary 28. This legislation would end the
Trump shutdown and ensure that our
Federal employees get their paychecks,
like, now.
This bill also sends a clear message
that we will not let President Trump
hold this government hostage for his
irresponsible, mean-spirited wall.
Mr. Speaker, this is the longest gov-
ernment shutdown in history. The gov-
ernment has been closed now for 27
days—27 days, mind you. All the Presi-
dent has to do is say: Yes, I will open
up the government.
Meanwhile, we Democrats continue
to do our job and demand that the
President do his. We have passed seven
pieces of legislation to end the Trump
shutdown—seven. But we can’t reopen
this government alone. Senator
MCCONNELL should do his job to end
this crisis.
Now, let me be clear: By continuing
this reckless shutdown, President
Trump is leaving 800,000 Federal work-
ers and 200,000 low-wage Federal con-
tractors in the lurch. Not only is this
an insult to their hard work, but it is
a slap in the face for the families who
have no other way to pay their bills.
I have spoken to many people in my
district who can’t afford to buy gas to

H690 January 17, 2019
get to their jobs, jobs that they are
working at day in and day out without
pay.
That is no way to run a country, and
House Democrats won’t stand for it.
Let’s pass this bill to reopen the gov-
ernment now. Let’s get the American
people the paychecks that they deserve
for the important work they do to pro-
tect the public, our food, our parks,
and our families who are suffering so
much as a result of them being used as
hostages and political pawns by this
President.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
3 minutes to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. ADERHOLT).
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise
this morning to speak in opposition yet
again to this Democrat offer for a con-
tinuing resolution. As has been said,
this resolution today goes through
February 28, and I am not sure why our
colleagues on the other side of the aisle
expect a different outcome just by
changing the end date.
There is, however, one simple way to
get a different outcome, and that is to
come to the table and negotiate and
talk. Show up at the table when you
are invited to negotiate. There is a seat
there waiting.
The people elected the President, and
they elected each of us, and they elect-
ed us to do our job. Quite honestly, leg-
islating is a very serious job, not put-
ting veto-bait bills on the floor of the
House to be voted on over and over
again, knowing what the outcome is
going to be.
All of the political points, I think,
have been made over and over again as
we have debated these continuing reso-
lutions. I think it is important that we
put partisanship aside. We have to
work together. We all have to sit down
at the table and decide how we can
move forward.
Just saying ‘‘no’’ to a physical infra-
structure, in my opinion, is not a nego-
tiating position.
I urge my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle to reject this bill that is going
nowhere so that we can get back to the
serious business of the legislative proc-
ess. Let’s show the American people
that we deserve the trust they have
placed in us to govern.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the distinguished
majority leader.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, Mr. ADER-
HOLT from Alabama has just said this is
‘‘veto bait.’’ What is veto bait? A prop-
osition to open up the people’s govern-
ment. Veto bait?
What is the Republican position? Un-
less the coequal branch of government,
the House of Representatives, says
‘‘yes’’ to the President of the United
States, you will continue to support,
ad infinitum, closing down the Amer-
ican Government.
Our Russian—I won’t call them en-
emies, but adversaries, at least, are
very happy, I am sure, that the Amer-
ican Government is shut down.
Our Chinese competitors are very
happy that the American Government
is shut down.
We look ridiculous on the national
and international scene.
I ask one of my Republican col-
leagues to stand, and I will yield to
them. Tell me which government of the
world shuts themselves down.
You are correct. The answer is, I
can’t find any government in the free
world that shuts themselves down.
Is that what you won’t vote for,
opening up your government, the peo-
ple’s government? Is that what this
fight is about?
Or is this fight about, Mr. President,
you tell us what to do?
Mr. MCCONNELL says he won’t put
anything on the Senate floor that the
President won’t sign. My, my, my,
what a coequal branch of government
we are.
Article I says we make the policy. We
decide what is rational to spend $5.7
billion on. Experts tell us this wall
won’t work. Senator CORNYN, Senator
GRAHAM, Senator KENNEDY, other Sen-
ators have said this is not a good in-
vestment. By the way, somebody else
who said that was Mick Mulvaney,
some years ago. He is now Chief of
Staff at the White House.
This is not a partisan issue, and this
is not about the wall, nor was it about
the ACA, nor was it about the level of
education funding when Gingrich shut
down the government or when TED
CRUZ and the Freedom Caucus shut
down the government.
Thank God for John Boehner, who
had the courage to say shutting down
the government does not make any
sense. It is a stupid policy. Thank God
for John Boehner, who came to the
floor, notwithstanding the fact only 87
of his Republican colleagues would sup-
port it, but with all the support of the
Democrats, we opened up the govern-
ment after 26 days.
Now, we have exceeded it this time.
What happens 2 weeks from now when
the President says: Either you do it my
way or no way, or I am going to shut
down the government.
We are paying a high price, Mr.
Speaker, for shutting down this gov-
ernment, not only the 800,000 hostages
who have been taken by the President
of the United States, with the com-
plicity of his Republican supporters in
the House and in the Senate. 800,000
people, 440,000 of them forced to work
without getting paid, 360,000 of them
sitting home and saying: How am I
going to pay my mortgage? How am I
going to pay my car payment?
They don’t know. I talked to a vet-
eran just 3 days ago who represents a
lot of veterans organizations. He said
to me: Do you know the highest reason
for veteran suicide?
I said: No, what is that?
Fiscal uncertainty.
b 1100
We have a lot of veterans in the Fed-
eral Government. We have a lot of vet-
erans who are either laid off or work-
ing and not getting paid. We are cre-
ating financial instability and anxiety
among our employees. What a stupid
way to run a business.
Yesterday, we had a motion to re-
commit, and it was to strike opening
up the government of the United
States. That was apparently, as the
chairwoman has expressed, a poison
pill for my Republican colleagues.
Mr. Speaker, I don’t get it. We were
sent here by our people to make their
government run more efficiently and
effectively for them and for our coun-
try, and what have we done? We have
said: If the President won’t agree to
opening up the government, we won’t
either.
Yes, we have tried every kind of al-
ternative: opening it up for 7 days,
opening it up for 14 days where we can
negotiate, and now we are saying to
open it up for a month, put people back
to work, give them a paycheck.
And what does the President’s Coun-
cil of Economic Advisers say just the
other day? We are hurting the economy
of the United States, which hurts ev-
erybody and the international commu-
nity.
I don’t get it. I can’t think that the
American people will get it, that their
Congress sits supine and says we will
only pass something if the President
says it is okay.
Have we come to this state where the
Article I branch of government, given
the power by the people to make pol-
icy, says to the person in the Second
Article, given the responsibility of exe-
cuting policy, to tell us: You guys who
make policy, don’t do it unless I tell
you you can?
How sad, how lacking in respect for
our own responsibility and duties to sit
idly by while not only 800,000 people
are held hostage, but also millions and
millions and millions of others who are
served daily by those 800,000 people.
I plead with my colleagues: Stand up.
Reject this policy of shutting down
government whoever does it, whichever
side does it.
And we don’t do it. We don’t believe
in it. MITCH MCCONNELL doesn’t believe
in it. He said just a few years ago it
was a failed policy. And he, Senator
MCCONNELL, was the guy that opened
up government. That is what he said.
He has now abandoned that, unfortu-
nately, to the detriment of our coun-
try—not just to the detriment of our
Federal employees, to the detriment of
the country.
Mr. Speaker, I would hope every
American would call their Member and
say: Look, you guys have differences.
That is all right. But don’t shut down
my government; don’t hurt my econ-
omy; don’t hurt my neighbor; don’t
hurt my mom and dad; don’t hurt my
child; don’t send people to the border
to make us secure when you talk about
border security and then don’t pay
them and have them worrying about

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H691
January 17, 2019
We are better than this. The Con-
gress ought to be better than this.
In a bipartisan way, we ought to say
to the President of the United States:
We are for you, against you on this,
that, or the other policy, but we are
united in the fact that we do not want
to shut down the people’s government.
Pass this bill. Send it to the Senate.
Let’s open this government. It is the
right thing to do.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
5 minutes to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. FLEISCHMANN).
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I
rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 28.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Rank-
ing Member GRANGER for allowing me
to speak and acknowledge my friend
and colleague, the full chairwoman,
Mrs. LOWEY, on the other side of the
aisle.
I feel compelled, though, at this
point in time to respond to the rhetoric
from the majority leader. The majority
leader, the gentleman and my friend
from Maryland, is very articulate and
he pleads his case, but as he is pleading
his case, the cure is right in front of us.
I am not going to banter around this
Chamber with terms such as ‘‘good
faith’’ and ‘‘bad faith.’’ We are all
elected in our 435 districts around this
country.
I come from the great State of Ten-
nessee, where the people want the wall,
the people want border security, the
people want our borders safe and se-
cure. I realize that there are others in
this body who perhaps don’t want that,
but we must remember this as we go
through our rhetoric: We owe it to the
American people to be precise.
Now, allow me to be precise. In De-
cember, in this Chamber, in the 115th
Congress, we offered legislation which
would have avoided this government
shutdown.
And let me be specific. This is a par-
tial government shutdown. I do agree
with the distinguished gentleman from
Maryland that no government shut-
down is good, but to be honest, 76 per-
cent of the government is open.
Perhaps in other times when we have
had government shutdowns and more
of the government was closed, it gave
us more of a catalyst, more of an impe-
tus to come together and open it. But
the fact is that 26 percent of the gov-
ernment is closed. The fact is that over
800,000 hardworking men and women
and Members of this Chamber on both
sides of the aisle—so that the Amer-
ican people know the truth—many of
whom, like myself, have suspended our
pay.
But I would argue that the gen-
tleman from Maryland is wrong in one
big basic area: We know that the cure
that they are offering on the other side
will not work. It is analogous to going
to a doctor; it is analogous to basically
saying, ‘‘I have got a problem,’’ and the
doctor says, ‘‘This won’t cure you. This
won’t cure you. This won’t cure you.’’
They are coming back on the other
side of the aisle, perhaps with passion,
perhaps in good faith, but they are
wrong.
What I am asking for is both sides of
the aisle, Mr. Speaker, as an appropri-
ator—and there are appropriators sit-
ting right over there, right over here.
We are the committee that solves prob-
lems. But when we know that the prob-
lem will not be solved with the cure or
the solution that is offered, you come
back to the table and you come up with
something that will work.
The President of the United States is
willing to talk. The President of the
United States wants to see the govern-
ment open, as do most American peo-
ple, but the President of the United
States and I want to make sure that
our borders are safe and secure.
Opioid addiction, drugs are pouring
across our border. People are being
abused. Children are being abused. We
have got to stop this not as Repub-
licans or Democrats, but as Americans.
We have got to come to the table
with a new cure, a new solution, and,
yes, a compromise, something that will
work, that the House, the Senate, and
the White House, two of our three re-
spective branches of government, will
support and get this government open.
So I feel the pain of a partial govern-
ment shutdown. It is wrong. The gen-
tleman from Maryland is correct in
that assertion. But I also know this: to
offer a cure that will not work is wrong
as well.
The cure is to come to the table. The
cure is to negotiate in good faith with
something that will work.
Mr. Speaker, I submit that we can
get this government open; we can se-
cure this border; and we all, as Amer-
ican Representatives, can serve the
American people and keep our great
American Republic safe.
The poisonous rhetoric has got to
stop; the partisan bickering has got to
stop; and this great committee and this
great House will get to work and start
working on other issues to fund the
government.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the chairwoman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, we are opening the gov-
ernment. Democrats have voted every
day for the last 2 weeks to 3 weeks on
opening the government.
I ask a simple question: To those who
are out working today, what would
they think of working a full day’s work
with no pay?
My good friend and colleague wants
to put this in percentages, just a small
amount of folks who are out and are
being devastated. But if you ask any
American as they get up and go to
work and they work that full, hard day
and they get no pay, I think they un-
derstand this is an enormous crisis—
the longest shutdown on policy, ever.
Senator MCCONNELL has not put one
single bill on the floor of the House to
open the government. So it is not par-
tisanship; it is not rancor. It is not ten-
sion; it is people who understand what
it means to not get a paycheck if you
are in the Coast Guard in a faraway
place, if you are an air traffic con-
troller, if you are Secret Service.
And thank you to the Speaker, who
realized the enormity of security for
the State of the Union or any other
large event, which many people know
might be coming in February.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Appropria-
tions Committee and the chairwoman
from New York for being able to recog-
nize that our job is to open the govern-
ment, but we have no partners, and we
didn’t shut it down.
Now, my friend talks about border
security. I am on Homeland Security. I
have been to the border more times
than I can imagine. I know my border
friends. I know the border States. And
we have a way forward.
In a bipartisan letter, Texas Members
of Congress, House and Senate, used
the term ‘‘critical infrastructure’’ or
‘‘tactical infrastructure.’’ But if you
want to secure the border, you can
have the moneys for opioid, gang,
trade, and child exploitation investiga-
tions, Customs officers at our ports of
entry, first responder funding, and
Coast Guard cutters, including ice-
breakers. That is the way forward, but
it is ridiculous to do as we have done.
Mr. Speaker, I just want to say we
are grateful for the Financial Relief for
Federal Employees Act.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from Texas.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I just want to make
sure that we know that people are
hurting and that we should understand
their pain.
So I want to acknowledge as a co-
sponsor and salute Mr. COX, who has
introduced the Financial Relief for
Federal Employees Act. Members are
working, Democratic Members are
working to provide some pathway for
achieving some resources, by way of
borrowing, for the Federal Govern-
ment. So we are working.
We must open the government now.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. RUTHERFORD).
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the ranking member, Ms.
GRANGER, for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I am sad to again rise in
opposition to this bill. It is now 27 days
into this shutdown and almost 1 mil-
lion people are out of work, and we are
still bringing bills to the floor that
have no chance at all of passing.
It is well past time for a compromise
to be found, but, Mr. Speaker, that re-
quires a reasonable negotiation.
Many Members in this Chamber, my-
self included, have expressed frustra-
tion over this political process and the
lack of negotiation taking place here
in the people’s House when President

Trump has made it completely clear—
in fact, he has offered negotiated posi-
tions and compromise, with no re-
sponse from my good friends across the
aisle.
The leader, I think, made some great
points about our adversaries, our peer
adversaries like China and Russia, and
why this shutdown is a bad thing,
which is why I ask them to come to the
table and negotiate.
b 1115
Everything he said, almost every-
thing he said, I would agree with.
Those are the reasons we need to come
together and reasonably negotiate. And
I think at the basis of all that, we
should remember what this legislative
body is all about, which is security for
and service to our hardworking, tax-
paying citizens. We are 435 different
voices from different walks of life, and
we know the perfect agreement is rare-
ly possible.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Florida.
Mr. RUTHERFORD. However, mak-
ing compromises and trading ideas
would do us a whole lot of good right
now, but that requires reasonableness.
It is time to come together on behalf of
the American people and stop this po-
litical bickering that is befalling this
conversation.
Our country is in desperate need of
border security, but we aren’t even
talking about that now. We are not
talking about the humanitarian crisis.
Mr. Speaker, we can do better. I ask
the Speaker to come to the table, find
a compromise, and let’s get back to the
work of the American people.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I urge
my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this
measure, and I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, my
friends, end this Trump shutdown, vote
‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the balance of
my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time
for debate has expired.
Pursuant to House Resolution 52, the
previous question is ordered.
The question is on the engrossment
and third reading of the joint resolu-
tion.
The joint resolution was ordered to
be engrossed and read a third time, and
was read the third time.
MOTION TO RECOMMIT
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I have a
motion to recommit at the desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentlewoman opposed to the joint reso-
lution?
Ms. GRANGER. I am in its current
form.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.
The Clerk read as follows:
Ms. Granger moves to recommit the joint
resolution H.J. Res. 28 to the Committee on
Appropriations with instructions to report
the same back to the House forthwith with
the following amendment:
Page 1, beginning on line 5, strike ‘‘Feb-
ruary 28, 2019’’ and insert ‘‘January 15, 2019’’.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from
Texas is recognized for 5 minutes in
support of her motion.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, my mo-
tion to recommit amends this joint res-
olution, changing the date of the con-
tinuing resolution to January 15.
This will ensure that Federal em-
ployees will get the retroactive pay
they deserve, consistent with the Gov-
ernment Employee Fair Treatment Act
of 2019, that the President signed yes-
terday.
The Senate will not take up, and the
President will not sign, a continuing
resolution through February 28. The
President has made clear that he will
not open the government until our Na-
tion’s border security is addressed.
But, the Democrats refuse to negotiate
with Republicans. They refuse to come
to the table.
This shutdown has caused real-world
consequences for Federal employees,
people who keep us safe and protect
our borders, like the TSA, the Border
Patrol, the air traffic controllers, and
the Coast Guard. My motion will allow
Federal employees to get the pay-
checks they recently missed.
This resolution provides some relief
to Federal employees, while we wait
for Democrats to come to the negoti-
ating table. We need to start working
on legislation that can be enacted into
law.
Federal employees should not suffer
because of the Democrats’ refusal to
negotiate.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on
the motion, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
opposition to the motion to recommit.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from New York is recognized
for 5 minutes.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I must re-
iterate, today is the 27th day of the
Trump shutdown, the longest govern-
ment shutdown in American history.
Therefore, I rise in opposition to the
motion to recommit.
This continuing resolution would
provide an additional option for Presi-
dent Trump and Senate Republicans to
take yes for an answer and end the
shutdown. This CR would pay employ-
ees; it would reopen government
through February 28, providing time
for Congress to come to a full-year
agreement, without further jeopard-
izing vital services or the pay of Fed-
eral employees.
The order of business would be sim-
ple, my friends: reopen the govern-
ment, pay Federal employees, and then
let’s have a serious negotiation on bor-
der security and immigration policy.
Maybe I will repeat that again, because
the order of business is very simple: re-
open the government, pay Federal em-
ployees, and then negotiate on border
security and immigration policy.
It is long past time for my colleagues
across the aisle, and across the Capitol,
to come to their senses and end this
shutdown.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
vote against this motion to recommit
and open the government today.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit.
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on motion to recommit.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the noes appeared to have it.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, on that

The yeas and nays were ordered.

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this question will be post-
poned.

legislative days in which to revise and
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on H.J. Res. 30, dis-
approving the President’s proposal on
certain sanctions on the Russian Fed-
eration, under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, it is regrettable that we
are in this situation. It is the result of
the Trump administration, again, try-
ing to make an end run around Con-
gress on an issue as important as Rus-
sia sanctions.
On December 19 of last year, the
Treasury Department notified Congress
of its intention to relax sanctions
against three corporations tied to Oleg
Deripaska, a Russian oligarch and
close associate of Vladimir Putin. The
Trump administration may have a per-
fectly legitimate reason for easing
those sanctions. But the reason we are
on the floor today is that we just don’t
know. And, under the law, we have
very little time left to get the answers
we need.
The sanctions we are dealing with
today were imposed under CAATSA—
the Countering America’s Adversaries
Through Sanctions Act—the bill we
passed 11⁄2 years ago to, among other
things, slap sanctions on Vladimir
Putin’s cronies.
The law is written so that Congress
would be able to step in if we thought
any administration could be making a
mistake in waiving or easing sanctions.
The Republican majority at the time
wrote strict and complex provisions for
exercising that oversight, allowing
only 30 days to pass a measure that
could reverse such a decision.
Again: the Trump administration an-
nounced its plans to ease these sanc-
tions on December 19, 30 days ago, in
the middle of the holidays, just before
the President shut the government
down, at the end of the last Congress,
and before committees in this Congress
have had a chance to organize and look
into this very serious issue. This tim-
ing leads me to believe that the admin-
istration was trying to jam this deci-
sion through so Congress would not be
able to act.
We ask the administration to explain
this decision. Their answers were,
frankly, inadequate. We asked the ad-
ministration to pump the brakes on
easing these sanctions so we could re-
view the decision further. They simply
wouldn’t.
So, with that 30-day window closing,
we are now forced to bring this meas-
ure to the floor to try to block the de-
cision. It is too bad, really. I would
rather the administration respected
Congress enough to allow us the time
to address our concerns. And, again,
the rules for this were put into effect
by the Republican majority in the last
Congress, and they are good rules. I
would rather they hadn’t dropped this
announcement when they did—that is
the White House—so that our commit-
tees could hold hearings and do our
work the way we want to.
But with the threat that Russia poses
to the United States, to our friends and
allies, to democracy around the world,
Congress cannot just look the other
way when the administration rushes a
decision like this. There are too many
open questions about whether
Deripaska will still control the compa-
nies that these sanctions address.
So, we need to move this resolution
of disapproval before the clock runs
out, and I ask all Members on both
sides of the aisle to support it today.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of this joint resolution.
I have long maintained that provo-
cations by Vladimir Putin and his cro-
nies require a decisive and forceful re-
sponse by the United States.
As the former chairman of the Home-
land Security Committee, I love the ef-
fort to strengthen our cyber defenses
so that Russia cannot attack our polit-
ical institutions and undermine our de-
mocracy. I have seen the classified re-
ports and I know the threats. I take a
back seat to no one in confronting Rus-
sia’s malicious activities. The whole
world has seen Russia’s aggression in
Ukraine and its support for Assad’s
brutality in Syria.
b 1130
Bottom line, Putin’s Russia is an ad-
versary and must be treated as one. An
effective foreign policy needs to use all
economic and diplomatic tools to con-
front belligerent behavior by a foreign
power. Those who threaten America
and our allies need to understand that
they will pay a heavy price so long as
those threats persist.
As someone who believes that par-
tisanship should stop at the water’s
edge, as the chairman often says at our
Foreign Affairs Committee briefings, I
don’t believe that this issue should di-
vide our two parties. In fact, it should
unite us.
This also means that Congress must
guard against playing partisan politics
with sanctions. We must impose them
when they are warranted, and we must
allow them to be lifted when they have
accomplished their goals.
I think many Members find Treas-
ury’s case for delisting these particular
Russian companies to have an argu-
ment, but not very compelling.
For example, some still have ques-
tions about whether moving some of
the oligarch shares to a family charity
and to a sanctioned Russian bank will
sufficiently sever the control and en-
richment that he currently enjoys, and
whether we can adequately monitor
that with transparency.
Even though we may have a good-
faith disagreement about the wisdom
of this particular delisting at this
point in time, I do want to commend
the Treasury Department’s Office of
Foreign Assets Control. They imple-
ment and police many of the sanctions
that Congress enacts, and there are
good reasons for their bipartisan rep-
utation for integrity and profes-
sionalism.
But because we cannot be sure that
we have removed the heavy hand of
this Russian oligarch, I cannot support
the delisting of these sanctioned enti-
ties at this point in time. Therefore, I
support this joint resolution, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CONNOLLY), who is a valued
member of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I
thank my good friend, the distin-
guished chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee.
I listened to my friend from Texas,
who I admire, but he is defending the
indefensible. Partisan? I rise strongly
in support of the H.J. Res. 30 today dis-
approving the President’s unimagi-
nable proposal to lift sanctions on
three companies affiliated with a Rus-
sian gangster oligarch, Oleg Deripaska.
Congress overwhelmingly passed the
Countering America’s Adversaries
Through Sanctions Act, CAATSA, in
August of 2017, to hold Putin and his
cronies accountable for Russian inter-
ference in our election, Russian inva-
sions of sovereign territories of other
nations, and its other malign behavior.
Under that authority, the Treasury
Department Office of Foreign Assets
Control imposed sanctions on Oleg
Deripaska, a close Putin ally, and sev-
eral of his companies, including United
Company RUSAL, EN+ Group, and JSC
EuroSibEnergo. In doing so, the Trump
Treasury Department stated Deripaska
has said he does not separate himself
from the Russian state.
Deripaska has been investigated for
money laundering and has been ac-
cused of threatening the lives of busi-
ness rivals, illegally wiretapping a gov-
ernment official, extortion, organized
crime, and racketeering. This is the
man you want to lift sanctions on?
In addition, we have recently learned
that Deripaska worked closely with
Trump’s former campaign manager,
Paul Manafort, including on a lobbying
project that Manafort said would
greatly benefit the Putin government.
Manafort reportedly also offered to
give Deripaska private briefings about
the Trump Presidential campaign.
Does this sound like someone deserving
of exemption from U.S. sanctions?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman
from Virginia.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, appar-
ently, it does to the Trump administra-
tion, which has agreed to lift sanctions
on three of his companies in exchange
for Deripaska dropping his ownership

stake from 70 to 44.95, never mind that
the new chairman of United Company
RUSAL’s board, Jean-Pierre Thomas,
has himself defended the Russian ille-
gal occupation, condemned by the
world, of Crimea, part of sovereign
Ukraine.
That is exactly why Congress re-
quired in CAATSA a congressional no-
tification before sanctions could be
lifted to prevent this President from
allowing his inexplicable bromance
with Putin to supersede U.S. national
security interests.
Now is the time not to ease pressure
on Putin. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port H.J. Res. 30.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. NEAL), the chairman of
the Ways and Means Committee and
my classmate in Congress.
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, 1988 was a
good year.
Mr. Speaker, today we vote on H.J.
Res. 30 to disapprove the President’s
proposal to terminate sanctions on
Russian companies, including United
Company RUSAL. My colleagues and I
have serious concerns about many of
the questions that, to this date, remain
unanswered from the Trump adminis-
tration.
Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska is a
sanctioned individual known as a bad
actor with close ties to the Putin ad-
ministration. The agreement reached
between the Department of the Treas-
ury and these entities seems to allow
Deripaska to maintain considerable
control and influence of Russian en-
ergy holding companies.
A week ago, I asked the Treasury De-
partment to delay the lifting of these
sanctions to allow for Congress to con-
duct meaningful oversight. My staff in-
forms me that the Treasury Depart-
ment has confirmed receipt of my let-
ter, but to this moment, we have not
received any word from Treasury on
their intentions. Given an expiration
date of tomorrow, it is unlikely that
we will.
As Members of this Congress, our
duty to the American people is to exer-
cise the oversight that ensures that the
administration’s actions are, indeed,
legitimate. We have a duty to ensure
that this administration takes a firm
stand on bad behavior by the Russian
Government.
I think some of the more important
elements of this consideration could be
taken care of with just a few months of
delay while we exercise our constitu-
tional responsibilities.
The Russian Government has, time
and again, prevented us from doing
what I have just described. We intend
here to proceed, even in the aftermath
of this decision today and what the
Senate did yesterday, to consider and
to take a look at this act that we be-
lieve today violates the intention of
our congressional responsibilities.
The malicious cyberinterference that
has attempted to subvert Western de-
mocracies, including ours, needs to be
fully examined. I urge my colleagues to
vote for this joint resolution.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. SCHIFF), the chairman of
the important Intelligence Committee.
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding. I rise in
support of the joint resolution, which
disapproves the removal of sanctions
against three companies owned by the
Russian oligarch and Putin crony, Oleg
Deripaska. Mr. Deripaska’s complicity
and Putin’s efforts to undermine our
democracy and those of our allies is
well known, and this is without the
benefit of what the special counsel has
investigated and thus far uncovered.
Simply put, the Treasury Depart-
ment has not provided Congress with
convincing evidence that the deal
reached with Mr. Deripaska truly ends
his control over the companies. And
the Treasury Department has not pro-
vided Congress with convincing evi-
dence that Mr. Deripaska will not, in
fact, benefit financially from the dives-
titure of these businesses.
These sanctions were imposed last
year on Mr. Deripaska and these com-
panies, over Mr. Deripaska’s malign ef-
forts and the Kremlin’s malign efforts
to interfere in our democracy, as well
as the efforts to invade Russia’s neigh-
bor and the continuing destabilization
of Ukraine.
The simple reality is, having imposed
these sanctions as a deterrent, nothing
has changed in the Kremlin’s behavior
to warrant the relaxation of these
sanctions.
Sanctions are imposed for a reason.
The reason these were imposed was be-
cause of the malevolent actions of Mr.
Deripaska and the Kremlin. They are
intended to influence the Kremlin’s be-
havior. So what has changed that mer-
its now the relaxation of these sanc-
tions? The answer is nothing.
The Russian actions in the last elec-
tion continued, through the manipula-
tion of social media, to meddle in our
democratic affairs. Violence along the
line of contact between Russia and
Ukraine continues and within Ukraine
continues. Nothing has changed in the
Kremlin behavior.
Nothing has changed to warrant
Treasury lifting these sanctions, and so
I join my colleagues.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman
from California.
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I join my
colleagues on a bipartisan basis, and I
thank my colleague from Texas for his
support to disapprove of this relaxation
of sanctions on Russia and Mr.
Deripaska, and to urge the rest of the
Congress to join us.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. WATERS) the chair of the
Financial Services Committee.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, you have
heard all of the facts about what is
happening in the Treasury Depart-
ment. I do not understand, for the life
of me, why there is any elected official
who would support delisting these com-
panies and Deripaska.
We are dealing with the enemy. We
are in an investigation. Deripaska is a
criminal. He is closely aligned with
Putin. We know everything about him,
and we know that he would benefit
from this delisting.
He would retain 45 percent of the
shares or the ownership in these com-
panies. Of course, he will use that to
basically pay off the debts to the bank
that he owes.
I don’t know why we have Repub-
licans who don’t understand this.
Where are they? Why are they not
down here defending what they are
going to do with their vote? Why are
they not down here explaining why
somehow they are not putting this de-
mocracy first?
This is not the first sanction that
they are going to try to delist. Oh, they
are coming with another in a few days.
It has to do with Jamaica, and I know
all about that. And they are going to
keep coming.
We should be implementing sanc-
tions. This is about the invasion and
the attack on Crimea. This is about all
of the other atrocities that have oc-
curred and have been implemented by
Putin and the oligarchs of Russia.
We need to stand up, and we need to
say that, yes, we are going to have
sanctions. They are going to be imple-
mented. We are going to make sure
that we don’t align ourselves with the
people who are undermining this de-
mocracy.
They have hacked into our DNC.
They have hacked into our State elec-
toral systems. And here we have people
who are willing to say that is okay;
that is all right; let them continue to
do what they do.
The Republicans who did not vote on
the Senate side need to be called out.
This is serious business, and I want the
Republicans to face up to it. Don’t
hide. Come on down here and defend
your views.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire how much time I have remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 8 minutes
remaining. The gentleman from Texas
has 17 minutes remaining.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I just want to be clear,
as the Republican leader of the Foreign
Affairs Committee, that I support this
resolution. I am not sure if my opening
statement was properly heard by the
other side of the aisle, but I join my

colleagues on the other side and sup-
port this resolution in a bipartisan
manner, as it should be, against our
enemy Russia, Putin, and the
oligarchs.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. DOGGETT).
b 1145
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I would
just say to my colleague and neighbor,
Mr. MCCAUL, I hope that means that
every Republican, none of whom are on
the floor here with him to explain their
position on this, will join us on this
important vote, because this sanctions
law against Russians was enacted over
President Trump’s objection. The pur-
pose was to deter Russian aggression
against us and our allies, not to yield
the right-of-way.
But now the administration is lifting
sanctions on a thug who is linked at
the hip to Vladimir Putin and who only
engages in more wrongdoing.
Let’s not aid this one-way gift to
Putin, a gift that was deliberately
slipped under the Christmas tree at the
Kremlin on the eve of congressional de-
parture so we could have as little over-
sight as possible.
Secretary Mnuchin suggested he was
open to meaningful additional time for
us to review this, but he has gone radio
silent. He calculated that there were
enough House enablers to rubber-stamp
this sordid deal.
We sought a classified intelligence
assessment of whether sanctioned
Putin buddy, Oleg Deripaska, would
continue to control the world’s largest
aluminum company after these sanc-
tions were lifted.
Leaders on both the House Perma-
nent Select Committee on Intelligence
and Senate Special Committee on In-
telligence have expressed their na-
tional security concerns about this
deal, but Trump wants to us to rely on
tweets, not intelligence; on fantasy,
not reality. If only he were as eager to
reopen this government for American
businesses and American citizens as he
is to reopen this sanctioned Russian
company.
Trump provides sanction relief for a
sham deal whereby this one thug trans-
fers his shares to his personal founda-
tion, a kind of Trump foundation-type-
group, his ex-wife, and a sanctioned
Russian bank.
Treasury refuses to identify for us
any of these new, so-called ‘‘inde-
pendent’’ directors. But what we do
know is that the chair of one of these
companies is someone who is under in-
vestigation by the British Parliament
and who cannot see classified informa-
tion, and the chair of another one is a
cheerleader for the Russian invasion
and annexation of Crimea and their
war with Ukraine.
All of this misconduct is happening
against the backdrop of a President
who has increasingly become a loud
megaphone for Russian propaganda and
attacking our most trusted allies,
turning Syria over to Putin, suggesting
we withdraw from NATO, praising the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan with a
distorted history. Each day of chaos is
another day when Vladimir Putin’s in-
vestment in the election of Donald
Trump pays him bigger dividends in
driving to undermine Western democ-
racy and our way of life.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield the
gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT)
an additional 15 seconds.
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, let us
send a strong, bipartisan message, not
just to the White House, but to the
Kremlin, by rejecting this favoritism
toward Putin.
Let’s vote today as Members of the
United States Congress, not the Rus-
sian Duma.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Con-
necticut (Mr. HIMES).
Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I very
much appreciate the advocacy of
Chairwoman WATERS, but this is fun-
damentally not a partisan issue, and I
appreciate the ranking member mak-
ing the point. This is a reputational
issue, and I want everyone in the
Chamber to understand that this is
about the reputation of the United
States, about the Congress, about the
Treasury, and about each individual
Member who votes today.
This is a complicated deal. I have
spent hours understanding this deal.
But there is a big question that every
Member ought to ask themselves: Is
this the moment to relax sanctions on
a Russian company; on a Russian oli-
garch?
Is this the moment to sign off on a
deal that allows an oligarch to hand
his shares to a Russian bank, which is
also sanctioned and controlled by the
Russian Government?
At the end of this deal, if this deal
goes through, Mr. Deripaska will con-
tinue to own and vote 35 percent of the
shares of this company. Mr. Speaker,
you can control the company with 35
percent of the shares. But an addi-
tional 28 percent of those shares will be
owned and controlled by affiliates of
Mr. Deripaska.
Now, Treasury says that doesn’t mat-
ter because there will be somebody
independently voting those shares. I
have asked three times now, and Treas-
ury has not told me who those people
are.
So what is the rush?
There is no problem in the aluminum
markets today. The price of aluminum
today is lower than it was before this
company was listed. This is
reputational.
The architect of this deal, Lord Bark-
er of Battle, is a British peer who has
been denied access to classified infor-
mation in the Parliament and who is
under investigation by the Parliament
because of possible ties to the Rus-
sians.
So I will just close, Mr. Speaker, by
making this point: there is no rush. I
have become an expert on this deal.
Members who vote against this resolu-
tion, if Deripaska turns out to be worse
than we think he is, if Lord Battle
turns out to be worse than we think he
is, and if the Russians and Deripaska
continue to control this company after
this vote, you too will become an ex-
pert on this deal, and not in a good
way.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 21⁄4 minutes
remaining. The gentleman from Texas
has 161⁄2 minutes remaining.
Mr. MCCAUL. I continue to reserve,
Mr. Speaker.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), who is our majority
leader and the author of this joint reso-
lution.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the chairman for yielding, and I thank
the ranking member for his leadership
as well.
Mr. Speaker, I join Mr. HIMES in say-
ing this is not a partisan issue. This is
an issue of America and whether or not
we are going to hold accountable those
who would threaten and undermine the
interests of the United States.
I thank Mr. MCCAUL for his prin-
cipled leadership on this issue, and I
thank Chairman ENGEL for his con-
tinuing focus on making America se-
cure.
Mr. Speaker, I am offering this joint
resolution today because it is deeply
concerning that the Treasury Depart-
ment would terminate sanctions on
companies owned by Oleg Deripaska.
Mr. Deripaska is a Russian oligarch—
meaning essential is very, very
wealthy—and is a very close associate
of President Vladimir Putin.
The businesses he controls were sanc-
tioned under the Russian sanctions leg-
islation the Congress enacted through
bipartisan action in 2017. As I have
sponsored numerous bills with Mr.
MCCARTHY when he was the majority
leader to make sure that the Congress
was on record and had policies which
would staunch the attacks on our coun-
try and on our security by the Rus-
sians.
I was deeply disappointed that the
Republican Senate rejected a similar
resolution yesterday. When I say they
rejected it, the majority of the Mem-
bers of the Senate—57 to be exact—sup-
ported this resolution.
I talked to Secretary Mnuchin yes-
terday and the day before, and I asked
Secretary Mnuchin: Given the concerns
about this legislation, about this with-
drawing of sanctions on RUSAL, that
they give us until February 28 to have
hearings to reflect upon and have fur-
ther discussions with the administra-
tion and make a determination wheth-
er we thought this action was in the
best interests of our country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H696 January 17, 2019
Unfortunately, when the Senate
failed to get the 60 votes they needed
to bring cloture so that they could get
to final consideration of the bill, the
Treasury Department decided to go for-
ward.
It is crucial that the Congress, how-
ever, make clear that the allies of
Vladimir Putin, no matter how
wealthy or how powerful they are, face
appropriate consequences for their ac-
tions against America’s security and
democratic institutions. That is what
this is about.
As Mr. HIMES said, it is not a par-
tisan vote. As a matter of fact, in my
view, if Barack Obama were President
of the United States today, this resolu-
tion would receive unanimous support
from my Republican colleagues and
overwhelming, if not unanimous, sup-
port from my Democratic colleagues.
Now, I understand the Treasury De-
partment’s goal in this instance. It is
trying to remove Mr. Deripaska from
control of these companies. That is a
good objective. I am also sensitive to
the economic concerns of our European
partners who are dependent on alu-
minum manufactured by RUSAL,
which is the Russian aluminum com-
pany, one of the largest in the world
and almost, maybe not a monopoly,
but an overwhelming share of the alu-
minum market internationally.
However, I do not have confidence
that this specific deal accomplishes
that objective. I believe many of the
Members of this House on both sides of
the aisle share this lack of confidence.
There are way too many remaining
questions for Congress not to act on
this resolution.
For example, I am not convinced that
Mr. Deripaska would fully relinquish
his control of RUSAL under this deal—
as a matter of fact, I think it is doubt-
ful that he would do so—or that the
Treasury Department used its full le-
verage in this negotiation.
I am also concerned, Mr. Speaker,
that Mr. Deripaska would receive mas-
sive financial benefit from this deal—
this is supposed to be a sanction—mas-
sive financial benefit, nearly unprece-
dented for a sanctioned entity.
Mr. Speaker, I hope our action today
will force the Treasury Department to
engage more thoroughly with Congress
on explaining its actions on this deal
and to seek a better one. I think their
intent was an honest intent. I am
doubtful they achieved it. I therefore
urge my colleagues to join me and,
hopefully, in a bipartisan way sup-
porting this resolution and I call on
the Senate to reconsider its position.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, might I in-
quire of the gentleman from Texas if he
is prepared to close.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I have no
other speakers, and, yes, I am prepared
to close.
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, I was in the October
2016 classified briefings on the inter-
ference by the Russians in our Federal
elections and in our Presidential elec-
tions. I condemned it at that time, and
I continue to condemn it. I supported
sanctions then, and I support those
sanctions today.
For that reason, Mr. Speaker, until
we have been fully satisfied by the
Treasury Department, I support this
resolution, and I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the remainder of my time to close.
Mr. Speaker, let me first say to Mr.
MCCAUL that I am very happy to hear
those words come out of his mouth. As
you know, we have had a tradition of
bipartisanship on the Foreign Affairs
Committee with Chairman Royce and
myself, and now with me as chairman
and Mr. MCCAUL. So I want to thank
the gentleman from Texas for speaking
out forcefully and saying the right
thing.
That is why Congress overwhelm-
ingly passed sanctions on Russia in
2017, because Members of both parties
understand the threat that Russia and
Putin pose. From the illegal annex-
ation of Crimea to the war in eastern
Ukraine to the support to Bashar al
Assad to the attack on our own democ-
racy in 2016, Russia is clearly a major
adversary that needs to be dealt with
strongly.
So when we see the administration—
and I would say this about any admin-
istration, Democrat or Republican—
when the administration appears to go
easy on one of Putin’s closest pals, we
understandably have serious questions.
We need to see the whole picture, and
right now we are not.
Congress cannot be left out of deci-
sions this important. That is some-
thing I hope my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle understand, and I
hope we can send the administration a
strong bipartisan message to that ef-
fect. This resolution represents Con-
gress doing our job, exercising over-
sight and using checks and balances
provided in the Constitution.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support
it, and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today the
House voted on a motion to suspend the rules
and pass H.J. Res. 30, disapproving the Presi-
dent’s proposal to take an action relating to
the application of certain sanctions with re-
spect to the Russian Federation (Roll Call no.
42).
I strongly support this legislation that pre-
vents the Trump administration from termi-
nating certain sanctions on three companies,
including aluminum giant Rusal, controlled by
Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch and close
ally of Vladimir Putin. These sanctions were
imposed under a comprehensive sanctions
law passed by Congress in response to Rus-
sian interference in the 2016 election.
There are far too many unanswered ques-
tions about this decision by the Trump admin-
istration. Congress must fully vet whether
these companies are no longer owned and op-
erated by Deripaska or his compatriots. Rus-
sia must be held accountable for their actions.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from New York (Mr.
ENGEL) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the joint resolution, H.J.
Res. 30.
The question was taken.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, on that I
demand the yeas and nays.

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that
all Members may have 5 legislative

objection to the request of the gen-

There was no objection.

Speaker, I yield myself such time as I

Mr. Speaker, last week, I came to the
floor with Democratic and Republican
leaders of the Homeland Security and
Energy and Commerce Committees to
urge the House to take urgent action
to prevent termination of the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security’s Chemical
Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards
program.
The House answered the call by pass-
ing H.R. 251 by an overwhelming mar-
gin of 414–3. Now, the Senate has acted
on this critical legislation and sent
H.R. 251 back with an amendment. It
falls to the House to get it to the Presi-
dent’s desk.

that the program should be reauthor-
ized for 2 years, which would have pro-
vided sufficient opportunity for mean-
ingful engagement with DHS, stake-
holders, and the Comptroller General,
the Senate amendment authorizes the
program for a shortened period of 15
months.
I am concerned this abbreviated au-
thorization period provides less sta-
bility for DHS and more uncertainty
for the regulated community, but un-
less we act, the CFATS program will
expire at midnight tonight.
Allowing this program to lapse will
be disruptive, irresponsible, and would
sacrifice the important security gains
that DHS and the regulated commu-
nity have achieved.
In short, allowing the program to
sunset would make our communities
less safe. After all, this program is de-
signed to prevent the next West, Texas,
where a dozen first responders lost
their lives after a bad actor caused an
explosion at a fertilizer plant, creating
a blast that leveled an entire commu-
nity.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this legislation, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong
support of the Senate amendments to
H.R. 251, the Chemical Facility Anti-
Terrorism Standards Program Exten-
sion Act. This bill reauthorizes the
Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism
Standards program, more commonly
known as CFATS, for a period of 15
months.
CFATS is a vital national security
program that makes Americans safer
by helping chemical facilities secure
dangerous substances. Under CFATS,
security and industry stakeholders
must work together to identify high-
risk facilities and ensure appropriate
security measures are in place to miti-
gate these risks.
I look forward to working with my
colleagues across the aisle and in the
Senate to develop a long-term reau-
thorization to protect our Nation and
provide certainty to industry.
I thank my colleagues in the Senate
for taking up this urgent matter to
prevent this program from expiring,
and I urge my colleagues to support
this bill.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I have no speakers, and I am
prepared to close after the gentleman
from Texas closes.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS).
(Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the ranking member for yielding me
this time, and I rise in support of H.R.
251, as amended by the other body.
This amendment is far from ideal,
but we have no other choice but to ac-
cept it. The most compelling reason
not to oppose this amendment from the
other body to a bill we passed last
week by 414 votes is that it expires at
midnight tonight, and that means the
ability to check our facilities goes
away. It is very problematic.
Let me repeat that. By law, the au-
thority to conduct inspections, protect
security vulnerability information
from terrorists, and help facilities with
technical help to make them secure, it
all disappears unless this bill is amend-
ed and passes the House and goes to the
President.
We must, as 414 of us did last week,
keep the existing CFATS program au-
thority going. I am glad we have a
chance to do that here.
The Chemical Facilities Anti-Ter-
rorism Standards program was
launched to surgically and directly ad-
dress gaps in Federal law regarding ter-
rorism and other intentional acts
against high-risk facilities due to their
use or possession of chemicals of con-
cern and at levels of concern—most im-
portantly, to ensure that antiterrorism
was the focus and not a contentious
regulatory arrangement.
CFATS was designed to foster col-
laboration between the government
and regulated parties. This program
and its operations have not been per-
fect, but CFATS appears to have vastly
improved in the last 4 years due to
committed leadership and a vision for
continued success.
What troubles me, though, about the
other body’s amendment is it doesn’t
give CFATS much room to make more
improvement. One of the major lessons
to come out of the hearings we had in
my committee on the CFATS program
was that, from 2009 to 2014, 1-year au-
thority extensions did not offer pro-
gram stability and stagnated the pro-
gram’s improvement.
It is no surprise to me that CFATS
made its largest program improve-
ments when it had 4 years of authority
and not just 1 year. Moreover, 1-year
authority extensions froze private-sec-
tor compliance investments as plant
security managers couldn’t convince
their companies that the program
would exist in the next year—this, even
as many regulated entities had their
own trade association programs that
were supposed to supplement the
CFATS program.
I would have hoped the changes that
we are making to this program would
not stilt the hefty investments made
by U.S. taxpayers to stand up this pro-
gram or potentially strand the invest-
ment the private sector absorbs when
Congress makes unexpected and rash
decisions.
All that said, the CFATS program
and its authority have earned the right
to continue. I had hoped a full 2 years
would be what the law would be and
would also provide the Department of
Homeland Security the ability to dem-
onstrate that its improvement is not a
mirage and that additional progress in
its work can be achieved. But we can-
not allow this program to expire.
Mr. Speaker, 83 percent of my House
colleagues and more than 70 percent of
the Senate were not Members of Con-
gress on September 11, 2001—the chair-
man was and I was.
Antiterrorism efforts don’t get the
kind of attention they once did, and
the fact that we have had no chemical
terrorist incidents since CFATS’ incep-
tion is not proof that terrorists aren’t
interested in targeting these facilities.
I want to thank my colleagues for
their support of the program and the
collaborative way we have worked to-
gether to keep this security program
going.
I look forward to efforts to extend
the CFATS program in this Congress.
We need to ensure that these chemicals
are kept secure, terrorists are kept at
bay, and that freedoms are kept pro-
tected.
I urge all my colleagues to support
H.R. 251.
Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I urge
all Members to support this bill to
allow this program, which protects and
secures our chemical facilities, to con-
tinue, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of
my time.
Mr. Speaker, if the House does not
act today, an important national secu-
rity program would terminate in a
matter of hours. I cannot overstate the
threat that would pose.
As DHS Secretary Nielsen put it in a
letter last November: ‘‘ . . . if the pro-
gram were to lapse as a result of the
current sunsetting provision, it would
increase the risk to our country and
create uncertainty across the chemical
industry.’’
Before I close, I want to thank my
partners in this month-long effort. My
fellow committee members, Represent-
atives RICHMOND, ROGERS, and
RATCLIFFE; my colleagues on the House
Energy and Commerce Committee,
Representatives, PALLONE, WALDEN,
TONKO, and SHIMKUS; our new partner
in the Senate, Ranking Member
PETERS; majority and minority leader-
ship staff, most notably Shuwanza Goff
and Luke Murry; and Alicia Smith on
my staff, as well as Jackie Cohen,
Jerry Couri, and Julie Klein.
I urge my colleagues to join me in
supporting the measure, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.
THOMPSON) that the House suspend the
rules and concur in the Senate amend-
ments to the bill, H.R. 251.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the Senate
amendments were concurred in.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRIES
Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, a point
of parliamentary inquiry.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry.

CORRECTION
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H700 January 17, 2019
Mr. GRIFFITH. Could the Speaker
inform us as to what the privileged mo-
tion is.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. There is
nothing pending at this time.
Mr. GRIFFITH. A further parliamen-
tary inquiry.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will please state his parliamen-
tary inquiry.
Mr. GRIFFITH. Could the Speaker
inform us as to what the parliamentary
privileged motion was that was pre-
viously referenced just a couple of min-
utes ago, that was to be taken up im-
mediately, for which we heard no vote.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Speaker will inform the gentleman
that the House just adopted a resolu-
tion electing Members to committee.
Mr. GRIFFITH. I appreciate the an-
swer, Mr. Speaker. Thank you very
much. That is illuminating.
A further parliamentary inquiry.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry.
Mr. GRIFFITH. Can the Speaker ad-
vise me as to why the gentleman from
Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) was not recog-
nized to call for the ‘‘yeas’’ and ‘‘nays’’
on the previous question related to the
continuing resolution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. We
paused for a few minutes and no one
addressed the Speaker for that purpose.
We did not hear any request for the
‘‘yeas’’ and ‘‘nays.’’
For what purpose does the minority
whip seek recognition?
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, did the
gentleman from Kentucky make a re-
quest for a recorded vote, because it is
our understanding that he did make
that request?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair did not hear any request for a re-
corded vote. We paused for a few sec-
onds waiting for that to happen and it
did not happen.
Mr. SCALISE. But if the Speaker
didn’t hear the gentleman make the re-
quest, but the gentleman did, in fact,
make the request, then can we recon-
sider the vote?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair did not hear the request. There
was no timely request.
Mr. SCALISE. Then a parliamentary
inquiry would be: Can we make a mo-
tion to reconsider?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As I re-
call, the motion to reconsider has al-
ready been laid on the table.
Mr. SCALISE. So is the Speaker say-
ing that that motion would not be in
order?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. At this
point, that motion is not in order. It
has been laid on the table.
Mr. YOHO. Mr. SCALISE, may I ask a
question?
Mr. SCALISE. Yes.
Mr. YOHO. Does the court reporter
have a record of Mr. GUTHRIE’s state-
ment? Can we have that read back,
please?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. For
what purpose does the gentleman seek
recognition?
Mr. YOHO. A parliamentary inquiry.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry, please.
Mr. YOHO. I would like to know if
the court reporter has taken a tran-
script and recorded Mr. GUTHRIE’s ask
for a recorded vote.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is authorized to consult the
RECORD in the regular course.
Mr. YOHO. If that RECORD shows that
he did ask that and it didn’t ask for a
vote, is this vote null?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair has ruled on this matter, and
again, I was awaiting a request for a
recorded vote and did not hear one.
There was no timely request.
The gentleman from North Carolina
is recognized.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I ap-
peal the ruling of the Chair.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The ap-
peal is not in order at this time. The
Chair has already announced that
votes have concluded. Members have
left the floor and have returned to
their offices. That request is not in
order.
Mr. MEADOWS. I appeal the ruling of
the Chair, again.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. There is
no appeal available in these pro-
ceedings at this time.

REQUEST TO RECONSIDER THE
MOTION THAT WAS LAID ON THE
TABLE ON H.J. RES. 28
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent to reconsider the
motion that was laid on the table on
H.J. Res. 28.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I object.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. For
what purpose does the gentleman from
Maryland seek recognition?
Mr. HOYER. I am not sure what is
going on, but I object. It is done.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objec-
tion is heard.
f
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I am not
sure if that is a formal objection, the
way it was stated. I would ask a par-
liamentary inquiry.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry.
Mr. SCALISE. Is there any formal
motion that would be in order that
would allow reconsideration of the vote
on H.J. Res. 28?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Such an
outcome could be achieved by unani-
mous consent.
Mr. SCALISE. Well, then, Mr. Speak-
er, is there any procedural motion that
doesn’t require unanimous consent
that would be in order to request the
Chair to reconsider H.J. Res. 28?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair does not give advisory opinion.
Mr. SCALISE. I would yield the
Chair as much time as possible to get
an answer on that parliamentary in-
quiry.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. For
what purpose does the gentleman from
Louisiana seek recognition?
Mr. SCALISE. I seek recognition to
see if there was an answer to the par-
liamentary inquiry.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Again,
the gentleman can achieve this result
by seeking unanimous consent from
our colleagues.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, that rec-
ognition was sought.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Would
the gentleman repeat it, please.
f
REQUEST TO RECONSIDER THE
VOTE ON H.J. RES. 28
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent to reconsider the
vote by which H.J. Res. 28 was passed.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. For
what purpose does the gentleman from
Maryland seek recognition?
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, reserving
the right to object—I understand there
is a problem—and I intend to object.
We have told all our people to go
home. It is not just a question of being
in their offices, with all due respect.
They are on their way to their planes.
It is far after the time when we usually
leave on a go-away day.
And I feel badly. I am going to look
at the TV. I don’t, frankly, think—I
was sitting right here. I didn’t hear or
see anybody asking for a recorded vote.
And, very frankly, you don’t usually
have to ask for a recorded vote be-
cause, when you were in the majority,
it was always us that had to record the
vote because we were losing. Frankly, I
think that is what happened, I will be
very honest with you.
But again, I would like to be able to
correct this situation. But I cannot do
that in good conscience because people
have told me they had 1:30 planes, and
they are gone. And I feel very badly
about that, but that is the fact.
I don’t think any games were played.
I am going to look at the tape—it is on
television—and see. I understand the
problem that most of you were not for
the resolution that passed. We didn’t
stop anybody from asking for a vote,
nor could we have stopped anybody
from asking for a vote. I was surprised
that it went without a vote.
The Speaker and the Parliamen-
tarian indicate that the proper proce-
dure was followed, but the vote was not
asked for. Therefore, I feel badly about
it, because I understand the problem
you are in. But I have Members who
have left for the airports and they are
not going to be here.
The vote, if it was reconsidered, is
equally important on our side as it is
on your side. I cannot expose my Mem-
bers to missing that vote, nor will I.
And I apologize for that. But I hope
you understand that, given the situa-
tion, I cannot let my Members be sub-
jected to missing that vote, which is a
very important vote for them. And,
therefore, I will have to object.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H701
January 17, 2019
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objec-
tion is heard.
f
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to
my friend, the minority whip.
Mr. SCALISE. I appreciate the gen-
tleman yielding, and I appreciate the
fact that now there are a lot of Mem-
bers who have left the Chamber.
But, at the same time, the gentleman
from Kentucky did stand and ask for a
recorded vote. Whether or not it was
heard or not, we will, obviously, have
to watch the tape. But it is an impor-
tant piece of legislation that Members,
I am sure, from both parties would like
to be recorded on, not just to have a
voice vote, which we are opposed to be-
cause it didn’t reopen the government
with border security, and, obviously,
we are in the middle of negotiations
that we are trying to resolve on that.
However, there would be a motion
that, I believe, Mr. Speaker, would be
in order that would resolve this for the
time being while we make sure that ev-
erybody has got the opportunity to be
back for the vote, and that would be to
ask unanimous consent to vacate the
previous vote and postpone reconsider-
ation until we return next week.
Mr. HOYER. This is a very critical
vote. The government is shut down. We
think the government should not be
shut down.
Mr. SCALISE. So do we.
Mr. HOYER. And the gentleman says
he doesn’t think we should go home.
Very frankly, there is nothing we can
do, because the majority leader has
said he will not do anything unless the
President of the United States gives
him leave to do so, and the President of
the United States wants to keep the
government shut down.
This was not a small vote, and I will
tell you, had it been on our side, you
would have heard us demand a vote.
Mr. SCALISE. If the gentleman will
yield, we would have heard you and al-
lowed the vote when we were in the
majority, and we did, in fact, allow all
of those votes.
Mr. HOYER. We raised an objection
at the proper time and we got a vote. I
understand that.
I will tell you—and you know that—
you look around the room, all of your
Members are not here. And, like my
Members, they are back on the road
going to a plane. I regret that we are in
this position.
Mr. SCALISE. Will the gentleman
yield on that point?
Mr. HOYER. I yield to my friend.
Mr. SCALISE. Clearly, there are
Members who have left. Clearly, there
are Members who are here. We can
compel Members to return if, in fact, it
is agreed to, to have the vote now.
But if it is not agreed to, to have the
vote now, we do have, within our pur-
view, within the rules, the ability to
delay the vote until Members can come
back that are not here. So for those of
us who are here and want the vote, and
for those who have left who would also
like that vote, the majority does have
it within their purview to work with us
to agree by unanimous consent to va-
cate the previous vote and then bring
it back for a vote on the House floor
when everybody can come back.
And I do want to bring up that the
majority leader made reference to the
minority leader in terms of what we
have been working with the White
House on. The President has made it
clear that he wants to negotiate, and
the President has also made it clear
what he is willing to sign and not sign.
Mr. HOYER. Reclaiming my time, we
are going to have a colloquy in just a
few minutes and we can go through
that.
b 1315
The problem is—and I say this hon-
estly, and I think most Members
know—if I thought you had asked for a
vote and the Speaker had not recog-
nized that vote—I was sitting right
here. I was not distracted, and I was
surprised that a vote was not asked for
because I understand that most, if not
all, of you were not for opening up the
government.
The fact of the matter is that a vote
was not asked for. We have now gone
through business, and we put ourselves
in a very difficult position. But I can-
not agree to a proposition where I have
told Members: No, you can go catch
your plane. Some had 1:30s, and they
left right at the dot of 1. I don’t know
whether they are going to make it.
And, you know, we are in a bad situa-
tion, but I cannot agree to a unani-
mous consent that is going to require
our Members to come back from wher-
ever they are. I don’t know that they
are on planes yet, but they are going to
be on them shortly.
And both sides have that problem. I
think you probably have that problem
anyway. And, very frankly, I am abso-
lutely convinced the outcome would be
no different.
The problem is so many of your
Members wanted to vote against the
proposition—I understand that—and I
would like to give them that oppor-
tunity. I am not in a position to do so,
and I feel badly about that, but that is
the position I made.
Mr. SCALISE. I would ask the gen-
tleman to yield. There would be an op-
portunity for you to do, in fact, that,
and that would be a motion to vacate
the previous vote and postpone recon-
sideration until next week so that
Members could be here and actually
cast that vote in the Chamber when ev-
erybody is back. That motion is in
order. If the gentleman would not ob-
ject to it, we could actually achieve
that.
Mr. HOYER. Reclaiming my time,
Mr. Speaker, we are going to be in ses-
sion next week. We are going to be
back here. It was a recess week. The
reason it is not a recess week is be-
cause the government of the American
people is shut down. We have tried now
nine times—this was the ninth time—
to open up the government.
Nobody was surprised. Everybody
knew. It was debated on the floor. I
spoke on it for, I think, 8 or 9 minutes
myself, so there was no confusion,
should not have been confusion on the
floor. And I think a vote should have
been demanded. It was not, and I am
not in a position to agree to a unani-
mous consent. But I am in a position to
tell you, there will be at least two or
three votes next week on opening up
the government.
My presumption is those of you who
have voted against such motions in the
past will do so again. So it will not be
as if you don’t have an opportunity to
vote on this same proposition. It was
not a complicated proposition, and I re-
gret, Mr. Speaker, that I am not in a
position to try to cure the failure, in
my view, because I didn’t hear it, and
I was, as I say, sitting here.
And the Speaker obviously didn’t
hear it either. I am absolutely con-
vinced that the judge would not have—
if he had heard a request, he would
have honored that request for a vote.
So we are where we are.
I would urge the Members—clearly, I
will stipulate to the fact that almost
all of you would have voted against the
motion if a vote had been taken, and
you can put that in the RECORD.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
f
RECESS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair
declares the House in recess subject to
the call of the Chair.
Accordingly (at 1 o’clock and 17 min-
utes p.m.), the House stood in recess.

FAIRNESS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE
AISLE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER) is recognized for 1
minute.
There was no objection.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, from time
to time, for whatever reasons, people
want to vote and, either because they
don’t get down the aisle or they don’t
request a vote, they do not get the op-
portunity to vote on issues that they
think are important to them.
From time to time, frankly, on our
side we have felt that we have been
shut out when the majority was in the
hands of the Republicans. We would

want fairness. In return, we ought to
extend fairness.
There are obviously many, many
Members who wanted to vote on the
continuing resolution which was the
subject of one of the votes, but from
our point of view—and having reviewed
the tapes—that did not happen. That
happens.
But because we want to assure Mem-
bers on both sides of the aisle that
their opinion can be expressed as they
would wish it to be expressed—and I
think Mr. SCALISE will say that. Mr.
BUTTERFIELD, former judge, who is one
of our fairest and best Members, I
would hope we would acknowledge that
he handled the matter fairly and con-
sistent with the rules.
Given that, it will be my intention to
now ask for unanimous consent to pro-
vide for the opportunity, when we re-
turn on Wednesday, so that we have all
Members here—we are going to return
on Tuesday. And I would say that we
will return before that. We may return
tomorrow if we can open up govern-
ment, if we have an agreement on that.
But we will return as soon as that op-
tion is available to us.
But we will return, if that does not
happen, on the evening of Tuesday at
6:30, and we will then, as a result of the
unanimous consent request I am about
to make, vote—revote—on the issue at
hand on Wednesday at the first of busi-
ness.
f
VACATING VOTE ON H.J. RES. 28,
FURTHER ADDITIONAL CON-
TINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT,
2019
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent to vacate pro-
ceedings by which the joint resolution
(H.J. Res. 28) making further con-
tinuing appropriations for fiscal year
2019, and for other purposes, was
passed, and the motion to reconsider
laid upon the table, to the end that the
Chair put the question on passage of
H.J. Res. 28 de novo; and, further, that
if a recorded vote or the yeas and nays
are ordered—in other words, re-
quested—on the question of passage of
H.J. Res. 28, further proceedings may
be postponed through the legislative
day of January 23, 2019, as though
under clause 8 of rule XX.
Again, Mr. Speaker, that will have
the effect of allowing a revote on the
resolution so that my Republican col-
leagues can reflect their view on
whether that measure ought to pass or
whether it ought to fail.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland?
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, reserving
the right to object, I first want to
thank the gentleman from Maryland
for working with us, and I especially
want to thank the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD) for
his fairness.
Obviously, emotions ran high as the
vote was moved through without a re-
corded vote. And for our Members who
want that recorded vote, maybe on
both sides that want a recorded vote, I
made parliamentary inquiries to the
Chair. I made motions as well. Some
were in order, some were out of order.
But every request I made of the Speak-
er pro tempore to provide that direc-
tion on what was in order for motions
to make, the Speaker pro tempore was
incredibly fair in those deliberations.
I want to thank the gentleman from
North Carolina for that fairness. I am
glad I never had to go before you as a
judge in those days, but I respect your
friendship and your fairness, as well as
the fairness to the gentleman from
Maryland.
I do recall a number of occasions
when we were in the majority where
there were times where maybe a Mem-
ber wasn’t recorded on a vote. They
might have just gotten in as the vote
was closed and wanted to have recon-
sideration, and, after conversation, it
is always the right thing to do to make
sure that these proceedings go in ac-
cordance with the requests of the Mem-
bers to be recorded, whether we win or
lose.
Maybe over the weekend I will have
the opportunity to whip some more
votes, and we might prevail, but at
least to have that opportunity to vote.
Mr. HOYER. Don’t say that too
strongly, lest I withdraw the unani-
mous consent request.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I don’t
want to get too carried away, but I ap-
preciate that we were able to resolve
this. And, again, I know tensions got a
little heated because these are impor-
tant issues. We want to get a resolu-
tion to get the government back
opened.
Obviously, we have some disagree-
ment over the border security compo-
nent of these negotiations, and we will
keep these negotiations going forward
and hopefully get a resolution as
quickly as possible.
But, in the meantime, to be able to
get that recorded vote on H.J. Res. 28
when we return and when all Members
return, I think, is the right thing to do,
and I commend the majority leader as
well as the Speaker pro tempore for
providing that opportunity.
Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reserva-
tion of objection.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, before I
end, we have just been through a very
difficult week in which one of our
Members was reviewed and disapproval
was passed almost unanimously, I
think, with just one vote opposed to it,
on our side.
I must mention: I don’t want any ar-
gument or we don’t need to debate on
this, but, unfortunately, at a height, I
know, of a lot of emotion, one of our
Members, a respected Member of our
caucus, TONY CÁRDENAS—who is, by the
way, from California—was met with a
call from the other side of the aisle to
return to Puerto Rico.
We ought to all be cognizant of the
fact that we need to be civil to one an-
other. We need to be polite to one an-
other, even. We can disagree very
strongly and, obviously, we do on issue
to issue.
But we have been sent here by 750,000,
give or take, of our fellow citizens, and
I respect all of you for having been se-
lected by 750,000 people. I may disagree
with them on selecting the policies
that you pursue, obviously—I under-
stand that—but I would hope that we
could refrain from any implications
which have any undertones of prejudice
or racism or any kind of ‘‘-ism’’ that
would diminish the character and in-
tegrity of one of our fellow Members.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
ervation of objection is withdrawn.
Is there objection to the request of
the gentleman from Maryland?
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of today,
the question is on the passage of the
joint resolution.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, on that I
demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this question will be post-
poned.

REOPEN GOVERNMENT
(Mr. CÁRDENAS asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. CÁRDENAS. Madam Speaker, I
am very proud and so blessed to have
been born in the greatest Nation on
Earth, the United States of America,
and I am a proud, proud American cit-
izen, a proud husband, father, son, and
grandfather.
I come to you today in the midst of
the longest shutdown in the history of
this country. I am disgusted that the
issue here isn’t about protecting vet-
erans or Americans’ healthcare or edu-
cation. Instead, it is about the demand
for Trump’s wall.
Last week, I voted to end the shut-
down. The bill passed this House, and it
sits in the United States Senate. Last
year, the Senate unanimously passed
basically the same funding bill, so
what is the difference now?
President Trump has taken over the
United States Senate, and now he
wants to punish the American people
by attacking our national security, our
safety, and the lives of the men and
women who serve our great country,
expecting them to work without a pay-
check.
Trump’s shutdown is hurting the
Coast Guard, that, right now, is pro-
tecting our national security. No pay
for their families. They are relying on
food banks to feed their families.
The Trump shutdown is literally en-
dangering the lives of workers like

CELEBRATION OF LIFE
(Mr. NORMAN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in celebration of life. Psalm 127:3
reminds us:
Children are a gift from the Lord; they are
a reward from him.
With 4 children and 16 grandchildren,
I know what a special gift each child is.
On the eve of the March for Life, I am
proud to gather with my colleagues to
recognize the important work being
done to protect each life each and
every day.
I look forward to supporting legisla-
tion that recognizes the value of life
and provides protection for each life,
starting from the very beginning. I will
remain a strong advocate for the sanc-
tity of life and continue to be a voice
for those who cannot speak for them-
selves.
We should celebrate every life and
cherish the potential each child pos-
sesses. As we March for Life, we show
the world the value we place on life
today and every other day of the year.

RISING IN SUPPORT OF
REOPENING GOVERNMENT
(Ms. STEVENS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in support of the worker. I
rise in support of the nearly 15,000 laid-
off auto workers.
I rise in support of anyone who has
ever been called a racial epitaph. I
stand with you.
I rise today for the American tax-
payer. Your government is shut down.
I rise for every Federal employee.
I rise for Tim Mach of Waterford and
all other aviation safety specialists.
I rise for the TSA agent who was
questioned about how he would put gas
in his car on Monday. It is now Thurs-
day.
It is now day 27 of this unreasonable
shutdown. The American worker and
the American taxpayer is wondering
when their government will reopen.
I rise today because this is unaccept-
able. I have acted and acted and acted
to reopen the government, and now, I,
from this great body, this U.S. House
of Representatives, I implore my col-
leagues from the Senate to do the
same.
f
RECOGNIZING THE MARCH FOR
LIFE
(Mr. PERRY asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I rise
in recognition of the tens of thousands
who will march in support of life to-
morrow in Washington, D.C.
On the 22nd of this month, we will
mark the infamous anniversary of the
misguided Supreme Court decision,
Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion,
without restriction, nationwide.
Since the 1973 decision, more than 54
million children have been murdered in
the United States alone. This is the
epic tragedy of our time, and we must
stand up for the unborn.
We stand in solidarity with those
marching and are determined to defend
the sanctity of human life. We thank
them for sharing their convictions with
dauntless courage.
f
RESTORING FEDERAL SUPPORT
FOR SHELTERS
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, as a
freshman Member of this body, I take
deep offense at the suggestion a little
while ago here on the House floor by
our colleagues on the other side of the
aisle that House Democrats are respon-
sible for this government shutdown.
To the contrary, their leader in the
Senate has failed his responsibility to
the American people to bring a vote to
the Senate floor on any of the nine ap-
propriations bills passed by the House
that would reopen this government.
A few days ago, I visited Turning
Point of Lehigh Valley in my district,
a shelter that assists survivors of abuse
and their families and that has stopped
receiving Federal funding as a result of
this shutdown. When I return to my
district tomorrow, I will be visiting
with more organizations that have
been similarly affected.
The shelter has a long waiting list.
So while it does extraordinary work, it
already struggles to maintain the fund-
ing it needs to take in all those who
are suffering in the community, and
that is the case in many communities
across our country.
So, if my colleagues on the other side
of the aisle wish to do something con-
structive, they should go see their
leader in the Senate and urge him to
bring a vote to the floor.
f
SANCTITY OF LIFE
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, this
past June, our family was rocked by a
very scary incident. We were excited
and joyfully anticipating the birth of
our very first grandchild, a boy whose
name would be Silas. Our excitement
and joy quickly turned to fear and
dread when Silas was born lifeless, the
umbilical cord tightly wound around
his neck three times.
I was in the waiting room when I re-
ceived a text from my wife, and she
said:
Pray now. Silas was born, but he’s not
breathing. They’re working on him.
I began praying, and about 15 min-
utes later, my wife, Amie, frantically
ran into the waiting room in tears and
said:
He’s still not breathing. Pray harder. Pray
harder.
Instinctively, I fell to my knees, and
I pled, crying to God:
Please, God, save his life. Breathe life into
him.
I realized in that moment what I
have known for all my life, and that is
that human life is valuable, precious,
and fragile.
Thanks be to God, about 10 minutes
later, the doctor walked into the room
and said:
He’s breathing, finally, and we think he’s
going to make it.
Two days ago, Silas turned 6 months
old, and I cannot wait to see what God
has planned for him. Silas fought for
his life, and I am so thankful he will
get to experience all that life has to
offer.
Members, every innocent child
should have a chance at life. God for-
bid, we would allow that fragile, pre-
cious, valuable, innocent life to be
taken.

Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
am proud to introduce, today, H.R. 643,
a bipartisan bill to stop all U.S. arms
sales and military aid to Saudi Arabia.
Madam Speaker, it has been over 100
days since the Government of Saudi
Arabia brutally murdered journalist
and U.S. resident Jamal Khoshoggi at
the Saudi consulate in Turkey.
The Senate unanimously condemned
the Saudi Government for this heinous
crime, but the House has yet to do so.
It is past time that the House clearly
and unambiguously declares that there
is a price to pay for such barbarity. Let
it begin by ending all U.S. arms sales
and military aid to the Saudi Govern-
ment.
I urge all my colleagues to join me
and cosponsor H.R. 643.

GIVING A VOICE TO THE
VOICELESS
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise
today because this month marks 46
years since Roe v. Wade was decided.
Since that decision, there have been
over 60 million abortions. I am not sure
there is any other way to describe this
statistic other than the word ‘‘horri-
fying.’’
With that being said, I also rise
today to recognize the thousands of
people who travel to Washington every
year to fight for the unborn.
Madam Speaker, the pro-life move-
ment in America is growing. Why? Be-
cause it is a movement about love and
about promoting a culture of life.
By promoting a culture of life, these
folks are advocating for more than just
saving the unborn babies. Although
that is extremely important, Madam
Speaker, this is a fight for the dignity
of life that says we need to view people
as assets to our society and not as li-
abilities.
When we view people as assets, it
means we are giving those who are
trapped in a cycle of poverty a real
shot to make it in this life; and when
we view people as assets, it means we
are seeing those with disabilities as
contributors—and nothing less.
I want to close by thanking all the
people, especially those from North
Carolina, who give a voice to the voice-
less. They are an inspiration to me and
to many others around the country.
f
NEGATIVE IMPACT OF SHUTDOWN
(Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend her remarks.)
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam
Speaker, I rise today on behalf of
800,000 Federal workers and millions of
Americans who have been negatively
impacted by President Trump’s shut-
down. Like many of you, hundreds of
my constituents have written into my
office to share how the shutdown is im-
pacting them.
One of my constituents in Bear, Dela-
ware, is an air traffic controller at the
Philadelphia International Airport. He
has been working without pay to en-
sure travelers can travel and continue
living their lives during this shutdown,
something he is struggling to do him-
self.
He shared how the shutdown is plac-
ing immense financial strain on his
family and the needs of his child, who
has a disability, that the stress of not
receiving a paycheck and not knowing
when the next will come is too much.
Our constituents deserve better. We
are on day 27 of this unprecedented
shutdown. Democrats have already
voted eight times to reopen the Federal
Government, and yet, still, we wait on
the Senate Republicans to act.
This shutdown is unprecedented, but
we have an opportunity to set a new
precedent, a positive one, where we
work together on comprehensive immi-
gration reform and border security.
First, let’s open the government.
f
HONORING HERSCHEL ‘‘WOODY’’
WILLIAMS
(Mrs. MILLER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Mrs. MILLER. Madam Speaker, I rise
to honor Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams for
his service and commitment to the
ideals that make our Nation great.
Woody was stationed in the Pacific
theater during World War II. A young
marine, he fought in the Battle of Gua-
dalcanal and in Guam, before landing
in Iwo Jima on February 21, 1945.
On the day the flag was raised,
Woody’s unit was surrounded. Under a
barrage of enemy fire, Woody charged
ahead, flamethrower in hand, attack-
ing the enemy and opening a gap in
their defenses that enabled his fellow
marines to forge on. We won.
For his display of heroism, President
Truman awarded Williams the Medal of
Honor. As part of his ongoing legacy,
the U.S. Navy christened the USNS
Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams in 2017, and
the VA named their Huntington med-
ical facility in his honor. He also
flipped the coin at the 2018 Super Bowl.
What a guy.
A lifelong West Virginian who resides
in Ona, Woody continues to advocate
for Gold Star families throughout the
country. I am proud to call Woody a
friend, and I thank him for his service.

BURN PITS ARE AGENT ORANGE
OF POST–9/11 GENERATION
(Ms. GABBARD asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. GABBARD. Madam Speaker,
burn pits are the Agent Orange of post-
9/11 veterans. Over 165,000 veterans
have registered their names into the
burn pit registry, something that is
voluntary, but there are millions more
of our troops who have been exposed to
these toxic burn pits during their de-
ployments.
They deserve recognition. They de-
serve care. And they deserve the serv-
ices they have earned.
So far, our government has failed to
fulfill its responsibility to them and to
recognize the toxins that they have
been exposed to, just like what hap-
pened to our Vietnam veterans decades
ago, when our government ignored
their exposure and the ensuing ill-
nesses that came from Agent Orange.
When I was deployed to Iraq, the
cloud of toxic smoke and fumes from
the massive burn pit in our camp was a
daily reality. I know the damage they
cause. I have seen the devastating toll
they have taken on my brothers and
sisters in arms who survived combat,
came home, but are now suffering from
rare cancers, lung diseases, neuro-
logical disorders, and more.
Today, my colleague and fellow vet-
eran, BRIAN MAST, and I are reintro-
ducing our burn pit legislation to ad-
dress this travesty, joined by Senators
KLOBUCHAR and SULLIVAN, to make
sure they get the treatment services
that they earned.
f
SUPPORTING DIGNITY OF HUMAN
LIFE
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute.)
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam
Speaker, today, I join my colleagues in
rising to support the dignity of human
life, and no time is more appropriate to
do so than when we approach the 46th
anniversary of Roe v. Wade.
Not only was the Supreme Court’s
1973 ruling a judicial overreach, it was
an assault on a fundamental truth that
is essential to our democracy, the
truth that all people are created in the
image and likeness of God and that all
people have the right to life.
Protecting that precious, God-given
gift of life is not just something I talk
about; it is part of my identity as a
doctor. When I graduated from medical
school, I pledged never to perform, as-
sist, or facilitate an abortion. The peo-
ple of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District have sent me to Wash-
ington to apply that pledge to my work
in Congress as well.
f
STANDING IN SUPPORT OF
UNBORN CHILDREN
(Mr. GREEN of Tennessee asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to stand in sup-
port of the most defenseless among us,
unborn children.
Since Roe v. Wade in 1973, we have
seen more than 60 million fellow
human beings lose their lives. This is
the greatest human rights violation,
largest humanitarian crisis, and
gravest assault on inalienable rights of
our time. We will not sit by and watch
this happen.
As a doctor and a soldier, I have
spent my whole life fighting to save
lives, to protect the innocent. I work
now to see the end to this assault on
life.
Part of that starts with ending fund-
ing to Planned Parenthood, America’s
largest abortion provider, which per-
forms more than 320,000 abortions
every single year. This is more than
one out of every three abortions.
Abortion must end, because America
stands on the equal worth of every
human being.

January 17, 2019
HONORING SANCTITY OF LIFE
(Mr. FULCHER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. FULCHER. Madam Speaker, I am
often asked why I came to Congress,
and I have asked myself that very same
question. It is certainly not for the
money, and it is not for the notoriety
or the scrutiny that comes with that.
Ultimately, for me, it comes down to
the honorable purpose of supporting
the divinely inspired principles behind
our Nation’s founding, being a voice for
those unavailable or unable to speak.
There is none more vulnerable or un-
able to speak than the unborn, and
there is no more noble cause than pro-
tecting or promoting life.
Madam Speaker, I stand today, dur-
ing this week honoring the sanctity of
life, to ask every Member of this body
to use any and all influence to return
to our Nation’s legal environment that
promotes life and to return to a cul-
tural environment that promotes life
as well. Our unborn would ask the
same, if they could.
f
MARCH FOR LIFE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from New
Jersey (Mr. SMITH) is recognized for 60
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam
Speaker, tomorrow, tens of thousands
of Americans will rally in favor of life,
because we have a moral duty to defend
the weakest and most vulnerable. I will
have a little more to say later on in
the Special Order. But it is my distinct
privilege to yield to the gentlewoman
from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX), a
great leader and a compassionate lead-
er as well.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his
leadership over the years on the issue
of life.
Madam Speaker, in recognition of
the anniversary of Roe v. Wade this
coming Tuesday, I want to bring the
real impetus of the pro-life movement
to the forefront of civil discourse.
The pro-life movement fights to pro-
tect life, from conception until natural
death, and we stand ready to support
mothers who face the challenges of an
unexpected pregnancy. We also know
that abortion is immoral and permit-
ting it deeply wounds our society. The
cause for life deserves to be heard this
week.
Lately, though, there have been
nuanced attempts by the left to hijack
the meaning of pro-life and impose
upon it a Big Government agenda.
We can all agree that the illegal end-
ing of a life through violence is tragic
and wrong. The reason the pro-life
movement opposes Roe v. Wade is be-
cause the U.S. Supreme Court case per-
mits the legal killing of our Nation’s
most vulnerable.
The pro-life movement is at the fore-
front of human dignity. We know that
upholding human dignity requires that
people be able to meet their needs for
housing, education, and nutrition.
However, the public policies that lead
to the optimal conditions for human
flourishing are worthy of their own de-
bates, so let’s leave aside the straw-
man tactics and have debates on those
policies at the appropriate time.
This week, we are talking about the
inalienable right to life, from concep-
tion until natural death.
To all who are fighting to protect
life, know that I am proud of you and
behind you 100 percent. As the 46th An-
nual March for Life takes place in
Washington this week, I am sure the
country will need look no further than
the witnesses marching to the Supreme
Court for an accurate understanding of
what we pro-lifers are all about.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for
her very eloquent remarks.
I yield to the gentleman from Kansas
(Mr. MARSHALL).
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker, I
am horribly disappointed and ashamed
that, today, taxpayers remain the top
funding source for America’s abortion
leader, Planned Parenthood.
As an obstetrician and gynecologist,
I have delivered thousands of babies
from Kansas. I dedicated my career to
protecting the sanctity of life, and I
firmly and wholeheartedly believe that
life begins at conception.
There are countless stories that I
could share today, and I can tell you
that some of the children I delivered
are now in college. Some are star ath-
letes. Some are leaders at their church
and in their communities. And some
are at the top of their class.
They are nurses and soldiers, doctors
and pharmacists, police officers and
teachers, clergy and judges. Perhaps
most importantly, many are now moms
and dads themselves.
I know these stories because, as I
travel throughout Kansas, I see the
moms, the moms I have delivered, and
I see their children. They are now
adults leading their own lives.
What no one on this Earth can do is
tell the stories of the babies that were
aborted and given no chance to share
their gifts with the world.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam
Speaker, I thank Dr. MARSHALL very
much for his comments and, again, for
his leadership. I am so glad to have
him here.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN).
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank
Congressman SMITH for organizing this
Special Order today.
Madam Speaker, every year, hun-
dreds of thousands of individuals from
all over the country come together for
the annual March for Life, marking the
Supreme Court decision on Roe v.
Wade.
As a strong advocate and believer in
the Word of God, I believe it is my duty
to stand up for those who cannot de-
fend themselves and lend my voice to
those who cannot speak for themselves.
Psalm 127:3 says: ‘‘Children are a gift
from the Lord; they are a reward from
him.’’ That is exactly what they are, a
gift from God that should be cherished
mightily.
We must do more in this body to
fight for the life of these children. I,
myself, have cosponsored and sup-
ported pro-life bills, but we must bring
them to the House floor and always en-
sure that pro-life priorities are in-
cluded in any relevant bill we pass.
I am proud to be an advocate for life
and a fighter for the unborn, just like
the thousands of men and women and
children who will be marching along
the streets of Washington, D.C., tomor-
row. I thank them for their commit-
ment to this important cause.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from
Nebraska (Mr. FORTENBERRY), a mem-
ber of the Appropriations Committee
from Nebraska One who has been out-
spoken for the entirety of his career in
defense of human life, as well as reli-
gious freedom.
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speak-
er, I thank Congressman SMITH, not
only for his tireless leadership, but his
compassionate, passionate voice on be-
half of women, saying loudly and clear-
ly, consistently, over the time he has
been in Congress, that women deserve
better.
Madam Speaker, we live in an age of
contradiction. We say that we want
peace. We say that we want joy. We say
that we want happiness, that we ought
to be living in a good and authentic,
committed community, and that we
ought to uphold the noble ideal of
human dignity. But we have to ask
some difficult questions. We have to
ask why.
Why, in this age of material plenty,
is life expectancy in America declin-
ing?
Why, in this age of vast and accel-
erating scientific discovery and tech-
nological innovation, is the world still
screaming for meaning? Why?
Could it be that we have to be brave
enough, that we have to be bold
enough, to look and confront our own
contradictions?
We say we want community, but do
we really care?
We say we want justice, but with cer-
tain exceptions.
We say we want liberty for all but,
really, only for our own perspective.
Madam Speaker, the reality is, life is
hard. Life can be brutal. Life can some-
times be very unfair.
b 1430
The reality is we have to face this to-
gether.
This is why the demands of commu-
nity, the demands of justice, the de-
mands of compassion, the demands of
liberty say to the woman, no matter
how hard the circumstances, what a
gift you are and what a gift the unborn

life is within you. What a gift. What a
gift.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam
Speaker, I thank Mr. FORTENBERRY for
those very eloquent comments. To our
colleagues and to those watching this
at home, I think he really has touched
a chord.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT).
Madam Speaker, Mr. CHABOT is the
prime author of the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban, a hideous method of
abortion where the baby is half born
and then is snuffed out when his or her
brains are literally drawn from the
baby’s brain area. I thank the gen-
tleman for authoring that legislation.
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman very much. I ap-
preciate him yielding. I just want to
make sure that we recognize his leader-
ship on this issue for such a long time.
When I first came to the House, Henry
Hyde was still here, and he was known
as the father of the pro-life movement,
at least in Congress, and Mr. SMITH has
taken that mantle from him, because
he clearly is the leader amongst all of
us here that have been trying to pro-
tect innocent unborn lives for many
years now, so I thank the gentleman
for that. He does a great job for the
people of his district, but particularly
on the pro-life issue on a national
basis, so I thank him for that.
Madam Speaker, our colleague, Mr.
FORTENBERRY, just mentioned he want-
ed to thank Mr. SMITH also for always
advocating on behalf of women, which
he does.
I just wanted to make the point
clearly that when there is an abortion,
there are two victims, obviously the
unborn child’s life who is snuffed out
before they really have an opportunity
to come and experience life as we all
do—they are alive, but they aren’t nec-
essarily conscious, obviously, and so
miss out on 60, 70, 80, 90, maybe, plus
years of life—but the mother is also a
victim.
I have had many women who have
had abortions, and ultimately later on,
because of so much trauma they have
had over their lives in dealing with it
psychologically, have become strongly
pro-life themselves, and I have met
them at many, many different pro-life
events.
Madam Speaker, I also want to thank
all those students and teachers and
parents and clergy who will be once
again here this year marching for the
cause of life.
This happens every year. It doesn’t
get a lot of attention by the media, un-
fortunately. Oftentimes there will be a
dozen or a couple of dozen protesters,
and they will have equal coverage to
the 100,000 or more pro-life folks that
will be here. It is a disgrace that that
happens, but I have seen it literally
over the years happen.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my
colleague, BRAD WENSTRUP. He and I
together will be joining with those pro-
life folks tomorrow, and we will have
at least 1,000 or so from our area. Our
folks will be coming from Cincinnati
and from Hamilton and Warren Coun-
ties back in Ohio. I want to thank
them for coming.
As Mr. SMITH mentioned, I was in-
volved and have been involved in my 23
years here in Congress. In fact, I want-
ed to get on the Judiciary Committee
because I knew that was the committee
where a lot of pro-life legislation origi-
nates.
So working my way up on that com-
mittee, I chaired the Constitution Sub-
committee and introduced two pieces
of pro-life legislation that became law.
One was the Born Alive Infant Protec-
tion Act.
We had people who have worked in
abortion mills who would come in, and
they would say they saw instances
where a baby would be unexpectedly
born alive, a later-term abortion, and
they were found in a sink, in a closet,
in a soiled utility area and weren’t get-
ting any kind of what we would basi-
cally give as humane treatment to ani-
mals. Human beings at an early stage
of life were just being left there.
Now, as a result of that bill, which
President Bush signed into law, they
have to at least get dignity. They don’t
have to take extraordinary measures
to keep them alive, but they at least
have some human dignity.
Then following up from that was the
bill that we mentioned, the ban on par-
tial-birth abortion, a particularly grue-
some form of abortion, which is now
banned. We think 30,000 or so a year
doesn’t happen. That is the good news.
The bad news is all abortions are
pretty horrific, whether they use some
salt solution or whether they are lit-
erally dismembered and pulled out
piece by piece. They are all horrible,
whatever stage they are, because they
are snuffing out that life.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank
some of my colleagues for promoting
additional legislation, for example, the
Pain-Capable, which essentially says
that if the baby can experience pain,
which we think is around 20 weeks,
that you can’t go beyond that; most of
us say not at earlier stages as well, but
at least by that stage; or when there is
a heartbeat, that we should also, if you
detect a heartbeat, protect that child.
And we ought to protect all these chil-
dren.
I will just conclude with this. Roe v.
Wade happened on January 22, 1973.
That was the date that decision came
out. January 22 is always kind of a spe-
cial date, and that is when people are
coming up for that date. That is the
day I was born. My birthday is January
22. That was my 20th birthday in 1973,
because I was born in 1953, but every
day when my birthday comes around, I
always think of all of those millions of
children, we think about 61 million
now, whose mothers made a different
decision, and so they have not experi-
enced the life that we all have been
given the opportunity to experience.
So let’s do everything we can to pro-
tect those innocent unborn lives.
Madam Speaker, I again thank Con-
gressman SMITH very much for his hard
work in this area, and all the other
Members involved.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam
Speaker, I thank the chairman for his
leadership.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. WEBER).
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman from New
Jersey, a champion for pro-life, Mr.
CHRIS SMITH.
Madam Speaker, I am a father of
three. I am a grandfather of eight. As I
often say when I speak to groups that
children are an extraordinary gift.
As Mr. FORTENBERRY said, women are
gifts; the children they carry within
them are gifts.
Why don’t we appreciate them more?
I often tell kids that children are the
only thing God can make adults with.
If we don’t give Him a ready supply,
you don’t want Him to run out. And
they always chuckle, but I always re-
mind them that they are created in the
image of Almighty God.
Look to the Bible in Jeremiah 1 and
you will see the quote: ‘‘Before I
formed you in the womb I knew you,
before you were born, I set you apart. I
appointed you as a profit to the na-
tions.’’
Children are known by God when
they are in the womb of the mother. It
is just that simple.
Our great Nation has carried respect
for life from the very moment of our
founding. Our forefathers noted that
we are endowed by our creator with
certain unalienable rights. You heard
Ms. VIRGINIA FOXX talk about them.
Life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap-
piness is promised to each of us in our
Constitution, in our Declaration of
Independence; not given to us by the
Constitution or by the Declaration, but
given to us by Almighty God.
So long as those babies have a chance
to live, they can experience those
rights: the right to life, the right to
liberty, the right to the pursuit of hap-
piness. Everyone hearing my voice has
that right and was given that right.
Shouldn’t they be given those same
rights?
Without the right to life, we are a
Nation without the pursuit of happi-
ness, without liberty.
The Supreme Court erred mightily in
this decision January 22, 1973. We
should be a Nation of law, a Nation of
rights, a Nation of life, and yet we
seem to struggle with that proposition.
Lord help us.
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman
SMITH for his diligence in this.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam
Speaker, I thank Mr. WEBER very much
for his very strong comments.

tleman from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN),

truly thank him for being the spear-
head. Somebody has to take the lead,
and he has taken the lead magnifi-
cently to call attention continually to
such, not only an important topic, an
essential topic that we as Americans
have to deal with.
There is a book by author Simon
Sinek that says, ‘‘Start With Why’’.
Whys happen to us every day. The sim-
ple thing to start with is, Why are we
here? Make no mistake: it is nobody’s
plan that we are here, with the excep-
tion of God’s plan that we are here; no
one else.
In January 1973, Roe v. Wade was de-
cided by the Supreme Court, as you all
know, and in the 46 years since, far too
many unborn lives have been taken
that could not fight or speak for them-
selves. It is our duty, our solemn duty,
as elected officials and as citizens of
the United States, to fight for the un-
born so that we all have a chance at
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness.
Every year, people from all over our
Nation come together in D.C. to recog-
nize the sanctity of life and to ac-
knowledge that every life in every
stage is precious. Many of those people
are on the road right now as we are
here, driving here, flying here from all
over the country.
We are going to have a lot of folks
from northern Michigan coming here. I
am looking forward to seeing them and
greeting them tomorrow morning as
they prepare for the March for Life to-
morrow afternoon.
The commitment that they have
shown, again, citizens from all over the
country, bringing their children, bring-
ing all generations here to march for
life, that is a commitment.
As a father and a grandfather, I am
proud to be a member of the Pro-Life
Caucus and I am proud to fight along-
side my colleagues to be the voice for
those who have no voice.
Madam Speaker, again, I thank
Chairman SMITH for his diligent work
and leadership for the cause for life. I
look forward to all of the work ahead
of us fighting to defend all life.
I am especially thankful that the
mothers of all my colleagues here in
the House of Representatives in the
116th Congress, all 434 of them, my
mom makes 435, I am so glad that they
all chose life, because that decision
decades ago has enabled us as elected
representatives of the American people
to truly discuss what it means, the
sanctity of life, what God’s plan is, and
what our role is as elected officials en-
suring that God’s plan for future gen-
erations yields the young men and
women who will someday take our
places and thank us.
God bless us all.
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman
SMITH for yielding.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam
Speaker, I thank Mr. BERGMAN for
being here on the Special Order. We are
so proud to have him on the Pro-Life
Caucus. I thank him for his leadership.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON), from
Ohio’s Eighth Congressional District.
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam
Speaker, I thank Mr. SMITH for yield-
ing.
Today I affirm that pro-life is also
pro-science. Advances in science, espe-
cially ultrasound technology in medi-
cine, make this clear, not just to par-
ents, but to anyone who will see the
live baby human growing inside a
mother’s womb; that we are talking
not about a clump of cells as some like
to refer to them, but indeed a baby
human. As a result, the country is be-
coming increasingly pro-life.
Every single life has purpose and dig-
nity. As Pope John Paul, II, stated:
Human life has dignity not because of the
work people do, but because it is imprinted
with God’s image.

This week, I am proud to welcome
pro-life leaders and friends from Ohio’s
Eighth District traveling to Wash-
ington, D.C., for the March for Life.
Today, we look forward to the day
when Americans will contritely turn
away from abortion, perhaps as vigor-
ously as they have rejected the abhor-
rent etiology that led to the three-fifth
compromise.
Knowing women who have experi-
enced abortion, I also hope that every-
one will show kindness and mercy to
those who wrestle with the enduring
trauma with repentance. May God have
mercy on them and on all of us.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GOHMERT).
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I
appreciate my friend, Congressman
SMITH, for his efforts in this regard.
Madam Speaker, I have talked before
about my wife’s and my first child
being born prematurely. We didn’t
know if we were going to get to keep
her. My wife had to stay in the hospital
in Tyler. They took our precious
daughter many weeks early to Shreve-
port.
The doctor there said: Her eyes are
not working properly. She can’t see,
but she knows your voice. She has
heard it for a number of months now.
It will give her comfort. So caress her,
let her know you are here, and talk to
her. Let her feel your presence. Let her
hear your presence.
They said: You can stay a maximum
of 2 hours before you have to take a
break.
While I was touching her little hand,
she took my finger and held it.
The doctor came along in an hour or
so and said: Have you looked at the
monitors? That erratic breathing is
now much smoother. Still very shal-
low, the heart rate still very fast, but
it is not erratic. She is drawing life,
and she is drawing strength, through
you.
I am telling you, these children, un-
born and born prematurely and born
full-term, they want to live. They want
a shot at life.
I know there is so much out there:
Oh, but a woman has a right to choose.
But we should speak up for the most
vulnerable who can’t speak for them-
selves.
That is what Ramona Trevino did,
former director of the Sherman
Planned Parenthood. She said what fi-
nally drove her out of Planned Parent-
hood were the monthly statistics. The
most important statistic was how
many young children, as young as 12,
are you getting on birth control pills,
because the younger you get them on
birth control pills, the more likely
they will miss days, but they will be
sexually active, multiple partners, and
the more likely they will get pregnant,
and we make a lot of money off the
abortions. So the most critical thing:
get them on those birth control pills.
Where in the world does that end up
being good for the child? Where?
We have people in China; they abort
female children right and left. Let’s
speak up for the females, for the un-
born. Give them a chance. Let them
live. You will be better. They will be
better.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam
Speaker, I will just say a couple of
words, and then I will yield to my good
friend, Dr. HARRIS.
Madam Speaker, doctors today rou-
tinely diagnose and treat a myriad of
conditions, illnesses, and diseases suf-
fered by society’s littlest patients—un-
born babies—significantly enhancing
their health and chances to survive and
to thrive. Comprehensive maternal and
prenatal care is critical and ensures
that both mother and baby are as
healthy as possible during pregnancy
and childbirth and in the weeks that
follow.
Yet, tragically, in the United States,
we have one of the highest maternal
mortality rates in the developed world.
While unborn children are killed at an
unconscionable rate, nearly 2,500 chil-
dren’s lives are destroyed each and
every day, about 906,000 in 2018 and
more than 62 million dead babies since
1973. That shocking loss of children’s
lives equates with the entire popu-
lation of England, more than 62 million
kids who have been lost.
This stunning loss of children’s lives
has occurred during a time when
science has made it absolutely clear
that birth is an important event in the
life of a child. It is an event. It is not
the beginning of life; it is an event.
And the miracle of life before birth is
nothing short of breathtaking.
The first baby pictures today, proud-
ly shared and displayed, are, most
often, ultrasound photos, showing the
baby alive and growing in the womb.
They are not of newborns—them, too,
later. But the first shot that we get to
see of our kids and grandkids are while
they are still in utero.
The humanity of these children is be-
yond doubt, yet the pro-abortion move-
ment, like some kind of modern-day
flat Earth society, continues to cling
to outdated, indefensible arguments
cloaked in euphemism.

Even the seemingly benign word
‘‘choice’’ withers under scrutiny.
Choice to do what? Dismember a baby,
starve a child to death like RU486 does,
and then forcibly expel her or him from
the womb?
In order to facilitate the baby’s ex-
termination, the pro-abortionists ag-
gressively deny, and they profoundly
disrespect, the unborn child. They
loudly mock and belittle those who de-
fend a child’s right to life.
Anybody in the pro-life movement
knows what that mocking is like.
Frankly, that harsh criticism causes us
to work even harder and, hopefully,
more effectively to try to protect these
weakest and most vulnerable among
us.
Someday, I truly believe Americans
will look back at America’s abortion
culture, which has, again, killed, to
date, about 62 million babies, and won-
der how such a seemingly compas-
sionate and enlightened society could
have had that blind spot that could not
see the innate goodness and value,
pricelessness, of that unborn child.
As STEVE CHABOT said earlier today,
we know that the women are the co-
victims. I and my wife and those of us
in the pro-life movement do work with
postabortive women. We love them. We
care for them.
Just yesterday, I met with two more
women who are postabortive and
talked about the agony that they
quietly dealt with for so long. There
are now many ministries that try to
try to reach out to them to say: We
want you to have a better life, a life of
reconciliation and hope. You do not
have to suffer alone. There are people
who care for you.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HARRIS)
the cochairman of the Pro-Life Caucus.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from New Jersey
for yielding to me, obviously, on the
eve of the March for Life.
Madam Speaker, let me follow up
with what my cochairman has said. It
has been 46 years since Roe v. Wade, a
generation and a half. There is no ques-
tion that there have been incredibly
significant scientific advances in that
time, advances that make the human-
ity of the in utero child clear and that
we have to revisit.
The fact is that science has now put
to shame the idea that life developing
within the womb is merely a ‘‘clump of
cells.’’ Well, I could describe any of us
as a clump of cells, too. I mean, I
guess, technically, that is what we are.
But science now has gone deeper and
allows us to show exactly what is hap-
pening and when a human being exists.
So let’s ask ourselves: Who exactly is
human? It is an important question,
because if you are human, you are enti-
tled to human rights, and those rights
are guaranteed under our Constitution.
It is a critically important question:
When is someone human?
Now, science has answered that pret-
ty clearly. At the moment of concep-
tion, when a sperm cell from a human
joins together with an egg cell from a
human, a new human life begins. Abso-
lutely unique.
How do we know that? Well, in those
46 years since Roe v. Wade has been
promulgated, we actually have Nobel
Prizes for DNA describing DNA and ge-
netics. We know that, at that moment,
a unique human being has been formed
with unique DNA.
My gosh, anybody who watches NCIS
knows that. Anybody who opens a high
school textbook knows that. When are
we going to figure it out? Because, at
conception, a new member of the homo
sapiens species—that is what it is; let’s
talk scientific—is verifiable by unique-
ly human DNA.
From the moment of conception, any
test on that life will show it is unique-
ly human, nothing else. It is not a lit-
tle chicken. It is not a little frog. It is
not a little cat. It is not a little dog. It
is a small human being.
Because of that, exactly at this
point, we have to insist on that human
being’s protection under the law.
This fact is not radical. It is not reli-
gious. It is bluntly, clearly, unarguably
scientific, because over the course of a
human’s development in the womb,
there is now what we call ontological
change, that is, no change in the na-
ture of that human being. The only
change is the change in the size. That
is the only difference.
Despite being further along in devel-
opment, adults are certainly no more
human than adolescents, adolescents
no more human than middle schoolers,
middle schoolers no more human than
kindergartners, kindergartners no
more human than toddlers, toddlers no
more human than babies, and babies no
more human than that in utero human
being.
We can’t allow the convenience and
politics of abortion to obscure science.
Humans in the womb deserve rights be-
cause they are uniquely human. They
deserve human rights.
The science empowers us, and may
the Lord, who is the author of all cre-
ation, encourage us today on the eve of
the March for Life. In the words of the
prophet Isaiah: ‘‘But those who hope in
the Lord will renew their strength.
They will soar on wings like eagles;
they will run and not grow weary, they
will walk and not be faint.’’
Tomorrow, let us march and not lose
heart for the sake of all the little
hearts that are beginning to beat at 22
days after conception who require our
advocacy. We must advocate for a re-
consideration of Roe v. Wade as soon as
possible to allow us to protect all these
human lives.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam
Speaker, I thank Dr. HARRIS for his ex-
traordinarily eloquent remarks.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the re-
mainder of my time.
f
RIGHT TO LIFE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. BOST) is recognized for the re-
mainder of the hour as the designee of
the minority leader.
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, as a fa-
ther and a grandfather, I know the love
that a family feels for their children,
and it doesn’t begin on the day they
are born. It starts when you first learn
that the prayers have been answered
and that a new life is being brought
into the world.
As we talk today on this particular
subject, a lot of people don’t realize
that there have been many things that
have occurred in my life and my fam-
ily’s life that make this a very per-
sonal issue.
Thirty-eight years ago, my wife was
a junior in high school. I had just left
for Marine Corps boot camp. We
weren’t married. She discovered that
we were going to have our first child.
She had five teachers who thought
that it would be a good idea, because
she was such a great student, to not
ruin her life by having a child. Those
five teachers encouraged her to go and
receive an abortion. I thank God that
she understood the importance of life.
That child, who would have been abort-
ed, now serves in the United States Ma-
rine Corps and is a major and will prob-
ably be a light colonel before long.
b 1500
He also has a law practice in our
hometown. He has raised four children.
He is an outstanding citizen. He serves
on the county board. He is a respected
member of society. He is even studying
to go into the ministry. I am so glad of
the choice that she made. Her life
wasn’t ruined. She might jokingly say:
Well, I have still been with you for 38
years.
But she went on and she used her
time when we were in Twentynine
Palms, California, in the Marine Corps,
she actually took credit hours and sent
that back to our home high school
where she graduated in the top 10 of
her class. As a mother, and as a youth
minister, and as a business owner, she
has shown others by example.
Really, as we move forward and we
talk about this debate, there are other
concerns that I have, and that is that
we in this body and in this Nation need
to realize that there are certain ques-
tions that come up; such as, When does
life begin?
Let me fast forward in our lives. Our
oldest daughter, on July 26, 2002, dis-
covered that her twins were in trouble
in the womb. Well, actually it was be-
fore that. We took her to a hospital in
St. Louis. It was just after my son’s
wedding, and she and her husband, who
had an older child at the time, they
discovered that these two twins had
what was known as a joint communica-
tion, and they were trying desperately
to get those babies from 25 weeks to 26
weeks.
But on July 26, we lost Hallie in the
womb, which then drove my daughter
Kasey into labor, and then we held

Ellianna for 1 hour and 35 minutes as
she passed. Now, we have had legisla-
tion that quite often says at that
point, that abortion should go ahead
and occur. Well, I have seen what a
child looks like at 24 and 25 weeks, and
that is not the time that we need to
say that that is not a life. I do believe
that life begins at conception.
It is my sincere belief that America
is only as strong as the willingness to
protect the weakest and most vulner-
able among us. My family participates
in those opportunities to help young
women who maybe have an unwanted
pregnancy, also to help people who
have chosen not to choose life, and also
ministers to those who have lost chil-
dren. My daughter is in that ministry
as well through a group called Tender
Mercies Foundation of Southern Illi-
nois.
But that is why I fought in Congress
to eliminate taxpayer funding of abor-
tions, and to preserve pro-life
healthcare providers the right of con-
science.
Tomorrow, we are once again going
to have the March for Life, which is a
pro-life movement that is growing
stronger all the time, as it should, as
science is proving when life begins. I
hope that you listen and I hope that
you get involved, and I hope that you
understand that there is a need.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas, Congressman CHIP
ROY.
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman yielding. I rise
today on the eve of the March for Life
as a cancer survivor, as someone who
appreciates every day that we are
given from the good Lord above as a
gift.
I want to recount a story from a cou-
ple of years ago that my wife and I
shared in ‘‘National Review Online’’.
What do you do when the doctor coldly
asks whether you would like to termi-
nate your child? Two years ago this
month, this became very real to my
wife and I and we wrote about it in the
article in ‘‘National Review’’.
We received a call from one of our
dearest friends. She was pregnant. She
asked me if I would be the baby’s god-
father, but her words of joy were tem-
pered. She then went on to explain a
series of harrowing medical concerns,
the most significant of which was that
the baby might be missing a part of his
brain, a part that connects the left and
right hemispheres.
She was terrified and she couldn’t
ask questions quickly enough. Forty-
eight excruciating hours later, the MRI
was performed and it was inconclusive.
She was told to come back again in 2
weeks for another ultrasound.
The next week, her obstetrician, a
woman doctor, silently reviewed the
file. Then she looked at our friend
straight in the eye and asked her if she
wanted to terminate the pregnancy.
Now, my friend explained that the
doctor had asked her the question in
the same tone that she might have
used when she ordered a coffee at
Starbucks. She didn’t blink an eye. She
asked the question in front of her two
little boys. She asked without her hus-
band there. She offered no explanation
or comfort. It was cold.
The doctor told her she had to decide
quickly because she was approaching
the 22-week limit, which is as long as
you can legally seek an abortion in
Virginia.
Our friend’s response was a source of
pride for us. She told us she almost
laughed and then politely responded
that termination was not an option.
She walked out of that doctor’s office
and never returned.
In a world where everything and ev-
eryone seems to be so sensitive about
every word that is uttered, we have
completely desensitized abortion. We
use politically correct words. One is
pro-choice. The pregnancy is termi-
nated because no one wants to say that
the baby was killed. But if you are end-
ing an innocent life on purpose, I am
not sure what other way to put it.
So how did it all turn out? Her
ultrasound was completely normal at
24 weeks. Her baby was born. He is my
godson. He is healthy. He came here
and he saw his godfather get sworn into
Congress.
Choose life. Life is not perfect. But
each life is perfect.
Madam Speaker, I include in the
RECORD this op-ed in its entirety,
which was published on January 26,
2017, in ‘‘National Review Online’’, co-
authored by my wife, Carrah.
[From the National Review, Jan. 26, 2017]
A MOTHER’S LOVE AND THE MARCH THAT
MATTERS
(By Chip Roy & Carrah Roy)
What do you do when the doctor coldly
asks whether you’d like to ‘terminate’ your
child?
For many people, January 2017 will be
marked by the inauguration of a president
and a march on Washington the following
day. For us, every January is marked by two
phone calls we received in January 2015—and
by a very different march.
The ‘‘Women’s March on Washington’’ has
already been all-consuming on social media.
It was billed as an ‘‘inclusive’’ movement
with the vision:
We stand together in solidarity with our
partners and children for the protection of
our rights, our safety, our health, and our
families—recognizing that our vibrant and
diverse communities are the strength of our
country.
Sounds so caring—until you learn that ‘‘in-
clusive’’ and ‘‘diverse’’ mean that if you are
pro-life, you are not welcome, and if you
don’t attend or join in this supposed soli-
darity, you are ‘‘anti-woman.’’ Doesn’t seem
as inclusive, does it?
In deed, it is wholly exclusive. In their zeal
to shock and to trumpet a convoluted notion
of freedom to have their bodies ‘‘left alone,’’
these marchers exclude the bodies of the un-
born. What about the rights of an unborn
child? What about the safety of an unborn
child? What about the health of an unborn
child?
Two years ago this month, this became
very real to us.
We received a call from one of our dearest
friends. Then 32 and already mother to two
healthy, wonderful boys, our friend said,
with an air of urgency, ‘‘[My husband] and I
wanted to wait a little longer to ask, but
something’s come up and we have to ask
now. I am pregnant—and we want you to be
the baby’s godfather.’’ We were thrilled, but
the excitement was tempered by the strange
introduction. Here’s what she explained to
me.
She and her husband, having two boys al-
ready, couldn’t wait to find out whether they
would add another boy to the crew or instead
start buying things that were pink. They
excitedly drove to the appointment for the
baby’s 20–week ultrasound to find out. A few
minutes into the sonogram, the ultrasound
tech excused herself from the room. Imme-
diately, their hearts sank. Something was
.wrong. It was a long wait. Finally, the radi-
ologist came back into the room and moved
the wand around with a blank look on her
face. Then, she told our friend to get dressed
and come into her office. She explained that
the baby might be missing a part of his
brain, the part that connects the left and
right hemispheres.
She was terrified but couldn’t ask ques-
tions fast enough. Would the baby survive
the pregnancy? Live outside the womb? Were
these minor developmental delays or major
issues? She and her husband were sent home
without answers and told to come back so
they could perform an MRI of the baby’s
brain. The technician thought that the baby
might be lying in a position that didn’t allow
the doctor to get a good view and that the
MRI could clear it up.
Forty-eight excruciating hours later, the
MRI was performed. It was inconclusive.
They did learn that the condition could
range from minor developmental delays to
severe cognitive and life-threatening issues,
but they wouldn’t know the specifics for
their child until the baby was born. They
were told to come back again in two weeks
for another ultrasound.
None of us stopped praying those two
weeks. For our friend it was a constant con-
versation with God. She was scared, but she
said that she knew it would be okay. She
knew the baby would be okay. She ‘‘just
knew.’’ She felt scared of the unknown but
also at peace, saying, ‘‘God gave me this
baby for a reason.’’ If the baby needed help,
she would do everything she could and God
‘‘would help’’ them. And she would love that
baby just like she loves her two boys.
She had a monthly check up with her ob-
gyn the following week. Her husband had to
work, but she took their two boys with her.
They liked going to hear the baby’s heart-
beat and the checkups were usually routine
and quick. She went in to the appointment
expecting that her doctor would reassure her
and answer more questions than the radiolo-
gist had. The doctor—a woman—silently re-
viewed the file. Then the doctor looked our
friend straight in the eye and asked her if
she wanted to terminate the pregnancy.
She called us right after that appointment,
understandably angry and terrified. Termi-
nate? What?
She explained that the doctor had asked
her the question in the same tone she might
have used when ordering coffee at Starbucks.
She didn’t blink an eye. She asked it in front
of her two little boys. She asked without her
husband there. She offered no explanation or
comfort. It was cold. The doctor told her she
had to decide quickly because she was ap-
proaching 22 weeks (which is as long as you
can legally wait to have an abortion in Vir-
ginia).
Our friend’s response was such a source of
pride for us. She told us ‘‘she almost laughed
and then politely responded that ‘termi-
nation’ was not an option.’’ She walked out
of that doctor’s office and never returned.
Yes, there may be some issues. She didn’t
have a perfect ultrasound. But it was her

baby who, she told us, ‘‘was growing inside of
her, kicking, loving music, moving when the
boys spoke toward her belly, doing somer-
saults when she ate ice cream.’’
We all realized that God put our friend in
this position for a reason. She has a strong
faith. She knew she could handle it, because
God was with her. She told us that the baby
‘‘would know love, would feel love.’’ Facing
her fear of the unknown with faith and love
strengthened her as a mother and a woman.
But what if it hadn’t been our friend? What
if another woman had listened to that doc-
tor, who made it feel so easy and acceptable
to just ‘‘terminate’’ and try again for a ‘‘bet-
ter’’ outcome.
We use politically correct words . . . The
pregnancy is ‘‘terminated.’’ Because no one
wants to say that she killed her baby.
In a world where everything and everyone
seems to be so sensitive, we have completely
desensitized abortion. We use politically cor-
rect words. One is ‘‘pro-choice.’’ The preg-
nancy is ‘‘terminated.’’ Because no one
wants to say that she kilted her baby. But if
you are ending an innocent life on purpose,
we’re not sure what other way to put it.
But sadly, even today, more than 3,000
abortions are performed every day in the
United States. That is more than 1 million
per year. Since Roe v. Wade inserted
unelected judges into the question of the be-
ginning of life, more than 56 million babies
have died at the hands of abortionists—56
million. Just let that sink in.
So how did it all turn out? Her ultrasound
was completely normal at 24 weeks. They
just couldn’t get a good read at her 20–week
appointment. Her baby was born in May of
2015 and is completely healthy. It was a boy,
by the way. None of us—but particularly his
loving and courageous mother—can imagine
life without him.
This week, there will be another march on
Washington: the one that truly matters. This
one is to celebrate life, and all are welcome,
including the unborn and those who love
them.
Choose Life. Life is not perfect, but each
life is perfect.
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield to
the gentleman from Florida (Mr.
WALTZ).
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, I stand
before you today as we approach the
46th anniversary of Roe v. Wade to
speak on behalf of Americans who can-
not speak for themselves.
Our Nation was founded on the no-
tion that every American has a right
to life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap-
piness. As legislators, we are bound to
protect these rights, especially as they
relate to our most vulnerable popu-
lation, which is why we cannot ignore
the fundamental right of an unborn
child to live.
While Roe v. Wade may be the law of
the land, I am here today because I,
along with many of my fellow Florid-
ians, disagree with it. I believe it is in-
cumbent on this institution to debate
the definition of life as well as our au-
thority and responsibility to protect it.
As a father, I have the privilege and
have had the privilege of watching my
daughter grow from a tiny blip on a
monitor, to a beautiful baby girl, and
now to a strong, courageous young
woman, the young woman that she is
today; and when I look at her my heart
breaks. It breaks for the children
whose lives have been and continue to
be taken from them just as they are be-
ginning.
These children could have been fu-
ture doctors, lawyers, Members of Con-
gress, teachers, military servicemem-
bers, anything they wanted. But, unfor-
tunately, because of a court decision
made nearly 46 years ago, we will never
know who those children would have
become.
Madam Speaker, as a veteran, I have
seen horrible things. And, yet, I believe
abortion is one of the greater tragedies
of our generation. I believe, in time, fu-
ture generations will look back on this
era in American history and condemn
us for the millions of children that we
have allowed to be taken. Because the
truth is, each life, from the moment it
begins to exist, is a precious person,
and therefore, has a fundamental God-
given right to live.
So on this anniversary of Roe v.
Wade, I stand with my colleagues in
solidarity for the lives lost, and I pray
for the mothers and fathers that face
very difficult circumstances sur-
rounding new life.
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Florida for coming
to speak.
Madam Speaker, tomorrow, we are
going to welcome to this city once
again the people who believe in the
sanctity of life. They will walk down
Pennsylvania Avenue from The Mall
and they will be well-behaved. They
will be kind. But they will be rising up
and letting the people of this United
States know that we are concerned
about the children in the womb that
can’t speak for themselves.
Madam Speaker, over the years of
my time in elected office, I have been
asked by many people from both par-
ties: Well, what do you know? You are
not a woman, and it is a woman’s
choice. Well, I am telling you that I
hope that no women that I know—and
I wish that would never be the case—
that they would be in a situation where
they are so scared of an unwanted preg-
nancy that they think that it would
hurt their lives.
But my wife, my 2 daughters, my 7
granddaughters—and my hope is that
with my 11 grandchildren, I have many,
many more great-grandchildren—that
they will grow up in a United States
that understands the importance of life
at its conception, that science, which I
believe is now beginning to show what
we have known all along, as one speak-
er spoke earlier, that when that cell is
formed and it starts coming together,
and then in just a few short hours or a
few short days, a heartbeat starts, and
then in a few weeks we understand that
that baby grows to the point that they
can feel pain.
Each one of these items are things
that are brought up in legislation of
why it is that we need to explain and
understand and put into law what truly
is life and where life begins.
I don’t blame the courts. I blame this
body over the years. I believe God has
the opportunity to say when life be-
gins. But I think science has taught us
certain clear factors about what life is
and when life begins. My hope is that
the American people will not only
think about this tomorrow during that
march, but they will think about it
every day of the year; that they will
think about all of the great wisdom
that we may have lost in the abortions
that have been committed over the last
45 years.
Madam Speaker, I want to say a spe-
cial thank you to everyone that spoke
here today and to the people I rep-
resent in Illinois’ 12th Congressional
District. I want the people to know and
remember what tomorrow is about, and
how important these young lives are,
and why it is important for us to do
our job as laid out in the Constitution,
which is allowing life to be protected.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

ISSUES OF THE DAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
UNDERWOOD). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GOHMERT) for 30 minutes.
Mr. GOHMERT. This is an important
week in history as I was taught in law
school that courts do not take up cases
to merely give an advisory opinion,
that there has to be someone who is ac-
tually harmed by some action about
which they are suing.
As we know, in the Roe v. Wade case,
at the time it was adjudicated, there
was no justiciable issue. The plaintiff
in that case now publicly states she
was used by the pro-abortion groups,
she was manipulated, and that she has
suffered because of what the pro-abor-
tion groups talked her into. She has
dedicated her life to try to undo the
wrong that has been done purportedly
for her.
So I appreciate my friends’ speaking
up. As I said, in my case, I will never
forget my child, many weeks early,
holding on, breathing rapidly, but
doing everything she could to live.
Most of us have seen the in utero
photograph of an unborn baby, an un-
born child, grasping the finger of a doc-
tor. They want to live. They want to
grow. They want to be. They want to
know.
Though my child couldn’t see me
with her eyes because they weren’t far
developed, as the doctor said: She
knows your voice. You give her com-
fort because she knows your voice.
We heard testimony in our Judiciary
Committee previously from a doctor
who did maybe 1,000, I think he said,
late-term abortions. It is difficult to
take as he described.
Of course, the female body is not able
to birth or get rid of a child without
intervention, so if somebody wants an
abortion of a child that is further along
and is developed, he described—and I
won’t use the detail he did because it
gets me too emotional.
He would go in with clamps, find
something that felt like an arm or a

leg, grasp hold, pull it off from the
body, dispose of that, reach for some-
thing else that felt like an arm or a leg
and pull it off, because the body with
the head and the limbs attached cannot
be brought out.
He would rip one after another the
two arms and the two legs off. Then, as
he would describe, the last thing you
reach for is something bulbous, and
when you find it, you have to crush it
so you can get the child out of the
womb.
After he lost his daughter in a tragic
accident, he simply could not pull an-
other child apart like that. He gave it
up and regretted all of those abortions
that he had done with no feeling until
he lost his own daughter in an acci-
dent.
I want to say I appreciate Majority
Leader HOYER bringing up a request
that people speak civilly about each
other. I get pretty frustrated with
some folks here, some in the Senate,
and that is just my own party.
But I keep hearing—and we have
heard this in the Judiciary Committee.
We have had hearings on it. People
keep wanting to say that the biggest
problem is this rising anti-Islam hate
crime body that is emerging.
But we have got the numbers here
from 2015, 2016, 2017. Even one hate-
based crime is too many. There were
257 incidents in 2015 involving anti-Is-
lamic feelings, hatred, prejudice, 307
victims. That can include yelling, but
normally, the offenses, there were 301.
But anti-Jewish, in 2015, there were
664 incidents, 695 offenses, and 731 vic-
tims. That is pretty much 2 to 3 to 1
more anti-Jewish hate crime offenses
and incidents than anti-Islamic. One is
too many, but I hope that people who
are in the House will cease the anti-
Israel bigotry and the anti-Israel ha-
tred.
After 6 million Jews were slaugh-
tered during World War II, before that
and leading up to it, they needed a
place, and, of course, it satisfied and
fulfilled a great deal of prophecy that
Israel came back. There are no de-
scendants of anyone who preceded the
Jewish people in that area currently
alive. Yet there is so much hatred for
the Jewish people.
I saw it in Germany last year. I
couldn’t believe I was seeing hatred ris-
ing again. Much of it was from people
who were refugees, but it is shocking.
Germany was trying to show the
world how loving, open, and accepting
they were, so they took in all of these
refugees, most of whom were Muslim,
and now they have all this anti-Jewish
hatred. So, hopefully, this House can
set the proper precedent by stopping
the anti-Semitic comments.
For heaven’s sake, I have been mad
at Senator GRAHAM over different
things, but one of our House Members
accused him of being compromised and
then made allegations insinuating that
he is really hateful. So I am hopeful
that my friends across the aisle will be
able to avoid going to those hateful
places so that we can have rigorous,
tough debate without trying to assas-
sinate character.
One of the places we see a tremen-
dous amount of bigotry, hatred, and
racism is in the Judeo-Samaritan areas
from the Palestinian Authority. It is
unbelievable that, in today’s time, an
area the United States is sending a tre-
mendous amount of money, that we
would be mute while the Palestinian
Authority sentences a man apparently
of Arab descent, Issam Akel. He is a
U.S. citizen. But he was abducted by
Palestinian Authority intelligence Oc-
tober 11 in Ramallah, and he has now
been sentenced to life at hard labor be-
cause he sold what they say is Pales-
tinian property to a Jew.
That is incredible. We are sending
them money to help cultivate that
kind of bigotry and hatred against
Jews? Really? This day and time we
are doing that? It needs to stop.
I have seen literature that is being
used in Palestinian areas to teach chil-
dren to hate Jews, to think of them, as
Farrakhan said, like termites or rats,
for heaven’s sake. Then I see friends
across the aisle in pictures embracing
Farrakhan as he has said some of the
most hateful, vile, mean-spirited, and
bigoted comments about our Jewish
friends. Really?
I would share the desire and the hope
that one day we really will achieve Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr.’s dream where
people are judged by the content of
their character and it won’t be nec-
essary to ask people on forms what
race they are.
I think it is important to know if
people are citizens or not because that
is how we arrive at how many Rep-
resentatives, that kind of thing. Those
are important things. It helps a lot
with governmental decisions when we
know who is a citizen and who isn’t,
that kind of thing.
Madam Speaker, I look forward to
the day we don’t have to ask race. Ev-
erybody would just check ‘‘human
race,’’ and it won’t matter. It doesn’t
matter if you are Hispanic, black,
white, red, or green. It won’t matter.
And I look so forward to that day.
Then we won’t need any groups that
use race or skin color to delineate the
group, because we will have other
things and other priorities that draw
our interests; and we will be deter-
mined by those kind of groups, not
hate groups, but groups that come to-
gether because of shared interests, and
race doesn’t matter. I look forward to
those days.
But in the Palestinian areas, the Pal-
estinian Authority is multiplying the
hate, and we keep funding them. I was
glad we cut back some of the money
being sent that is still being spent and
still going there.
The other thing that we keep hearing
more about than anything is how hate-
ful, immoral, and mean-spirited walls
are, even though everybody who talks
about walls has an outer wall around
their home or their apartment build-
ing. Whatever they live in, there is an
outer wall.
Why? Madam Speaker, it is because
you don’t want everybody coming and
parading through your home unless
you invite them.
Yes, Madam Speaker, just because
there are burglars who can get past
your dead bolt lock or break through
your window, you still have a wall. You
still have dead bolts because it will
help slow people down from trying to
get in, and hopefully they will be
caught before they can get in and do
damage.
Hopefully, just the presence of an
outer wall around your home—I under-
stand most people want to have inte-
rior walls to give family members some
privacy, but if walls are immoral, why
would you have one around your home,
the outer wall of your home? It is be-
cause they work. They are not im-
moral.
Some people say, oh, it is a 14th cen-
tury solution. Actually, it is more like
a 3000 B.C. solution.
I have a picture in my office of some
of our military there at a place called
Ur, where Abraham came from. There
has been a massive wall there since
about 3000 B.C.
They are used to slow down people
whom you don’t want coming in with-
out your permission.
So it isn’t a 21st century problem
with having people walk into your
home or homeland unimpeded. It is as
old as humanity itself, and walls can
help.
Madam Speaker, that is why I had
the picture the other day, earlier this
week, of the huge fence barrier that
was put up at the 2016 Democratic Na-
tional Convention, because the people
in charge there—and Hillary Clinton
was the nominal head of the party,
being the nominee. Those folks under-
stood those help keep out people you
don’t want in.
Nobody told the head of the Demo-
cratic National Committee, including
their nominee, that fences, barriers,
and walls don’t work. So they had it
out there on full display because they
didn’t want anybody coming in they
didn’t want there, and that includes
people who were not delegates or the
people they wanted. They knew that
walls, fencing, and barriers would
work, but only if you have security
there to watch over them.
So it is a good thing. So we had that
picture.
Then here is a picture of a wall and
fence. A lot of people say Israel has a
wall around it, because they do have
some wall, but most of it is fence. It
works because they guard it.
b 1530
We ought to be doing the same thing
because, if we allow this Nation to con-
tinue to have people pouring in, even
people who pour in well motivated,
coming in illegally, they haven’t been
educated on how you keep a self-gov-
erning country, and you lose it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H712 January 17, 2019
Mostly, in history, they haven’t
lasted 200 years. That is about the end.
We are beyond that. But we are headed
to the dustbin of history unless we
begin to teach all those here how you
keep a republic.
And I know some have been
miseducated and think socialism is the
way to go—oh, it is so much more car-
ing; you have got billionaires pouring
in hundreds of millions of dollars—be-
cause they think, when all is said and
done, they will be part of that top rul-
ing class. In socialism you never have
just one class—that is the way it is
sold—but you have the big, powerful,
rich ruling class, like oligarchs in Rus-
sia, and then you have the ruled class.
Actually, I saw it firsthand as an ex-
change student in the Soviet Union.
You have got the rulers and you have
got the ruled, and you don’t really
have a middle class. It is not a good
way to live because you have got to
have a totalitarian government, as
Khrushchev found out when he tried to
come up with a plan to get rid of gov-
ernment and go just to the ‘‘share and
share alike’’ philosophy. He disbanded
the commission because it didn’t work.
There is no way to ever go without a
totalitarian government that tells you
everything you can or can’t do.
Anyway, Israel, walls work, fences
work, those barriers work. And I think
this is a lovely wall and fence.
My understanding is this one is part
of—well, it protects the Hillary Clinton
Chappaqua residence, Chappaqua, New
York. Nobody has gotten word to Hil-
lary Clinton, apparently, that these
things don’t work. You have got secu-
rity. You have got the walls. You have
got the fence.
I know she is saying otherwise now,
but she knows. That is why she has got
a wall and a fence. She knows it works.
It is not immoral, trying to protect
what you have got, protect the people
you love, what you love.
There are just so many examples
around the world.
I needed this marked. I believe this is
Bill de Blasio’s. I am not certain. I
think this is his wall and fence be-
cause, even though he has said some-
thing like, ‘‘They have got plenty of
money; it is in the wrong hands,’’ he
doesn’t realize he is one of the wrong
hands it is in.
And if he would get rid of his wall, he
could invite all those people into his
home, and he could stop saying walls
are immoral, because he got rid of his
immoral wall.
And, obviously, for those who don’t
understand sarcasm, that is sarcasm.
And these are examples here of walls,
fences that work. They keep people
out.
Now, the Iron Curtain, that was a dif-
ferent matter, because they were keep-
ing people in that didn’t want to be in,
shooting people that didn’t stay in.
But they work. That is why they are
around prisons. That is why they are
around jails or jail facilities. Yes, they
work. We have found that for thou-
sands of years.
So I hope that we will be more real-
istic in the arguments and debates that
go on here, stop the ridiculous rhet-
oric.
Everybody in here knows walls work.
That is why their home has outer walls
instead of just some partitions in the
middle of the home where anybody can
walk in and around and through their
home. They know those walls work.
So let’s talk about what most people
in here have voted for. Let’s get the
government reopened because we agree
to do something to stop the death, the
human carnage, the rape, all of these
horrendous things brought about by
drug cartels controlling our southern
border. Let’s stop it. Let’s dry up the
cartels.
And for those who don’t care about
the Americans, if your number one
goal is to help the people of Mexico,
help the people of Central America as
well, the thing to do is get a barrier,
get a wall where we need it, but secure
the whole thing. Then we dry up the
money to the drug cartels and Mexico
becomes a top ten economy; they have
a burgeoning middle class and they
have a better standard of living.
The best thing we can do for Mexico
and Central America: build a wall
where we need it; secure the border;
cut off the money, then, flowing to the
drug cartels; and give the people of
Mexico a life they deserve.
Having some trickle in—they have
got 130,000 or so in Mexico. Having a
million come in a year, that is still not
helping the people of Mexico, and it is
bringing down our own country be-
cause we are not prepared and able to
take care of such mass illegal invaders
on top of the million-plus legal visas
we give people to come in our country.
Why? Because we are the most gen-
erous country in the world when it
comes to philanthropy and when it
comes to giving visas, because we know
it is a strength to have many races, to
have many national origins.
But the one thing that I loved about
9/12—when we gathered in our town
square and we held hands, we sang
hymns together, we prayed together—
that day, for that day, there was not a
single hyphenated America out there.
Every person there said, ‘‘I am an
American’’—all races, creed, color, na-
tional origin, age. On 9/12, we were one
nation, under God. And I hope and pray
we can get back to that place.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Eternal Father, answer our prayers,
for Your unfailing love sustains us.
Give our lawmakers a great faith to
live for as You deliver them from
doubt, disillusionment, bitterness, cyn-
icism, and frustration. Lord, teach
them so to live and toil that they may
face with clear consciences the gaze of
their peers and the judgment of pos-
terity.
Be near to the unpaid Federal work-
ers and their families who are feeling
the economic strains of this partial
government shutdown. Lord, don’t per-
mit these trials to overwhelm them.
And, Lord, touch with Your mercy
the loved ones of the U.S. citizens
killed in Northern Syria.
We pray in Your compassionate
Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
BRAUN). The majority leader is recog-
nized.
f
S. 109
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, to-
morrow Washington will play host to
one of our Nation’s proudest examples
of peaceful activism: the 49th annual
March for Life.
Hundreds of thousands of Ameri-
cans—from different States, different
faiths, different ethnic backgrounds—
will speak with one voice on behalf of
those who cannot speak for themselves.
I would like to welcome the marchers,
especially my fellow Kentuckians, in-
cluding Margie Montgomery, executive
director of Kentucky Right to Life. I
welcome all the marchers with grati-
tude. I am grateful they are helping
shed light on this great shame of our
society and bearing witness to the fact
that human dignity and human rights
are for everyone.
As they march tomorrow, our friends
can take pride in knowing our beliefs
are not just consistent with morality
and supported by science; they are also
squarely within the mainstream of our
society. According to one recent sur-
vey, a sizable majority of American
adults hold views on the subject that
are far, far from the absolutist position
of the far left.
Seventy-five percent of all Ameri-
cans, including more than 60 percent of
those who call themselves pro-choice,
support more protection for the lives of
unborn children.
The far left is wedded to the most ex-
treme positions on this subject. For ex-
ample, the radical left wants America
to remain one of only seven—seven—
countries in the entire world, including
China and North Korea, that allow
elective abortions to occur after 20
weeks and even after the child is capa-
ble of feeling pain. The American peo-
ple, however, know better. That survey
also found that a majority of Ameri-
cans oppose taxpayer-funded abortions.
So I am proud today to stand with that
majority of Americans and urge every
Member of this body to join me in sup-
porting the No Taxpayer Funding for
Abortion Act this afternoon.
Thanks to the dedication of Senators
WICKER, ROBERTS, ERNST, LANKFORD,
DAINES, BLUNT, and many others, the
bill before us would supplement exist-
ing law and bolster the important,
longstanding protections of the Hyde
amendment.
By implementing a governmentwide,
statutory prohibition on taxpayer sub-
sidies for abortion and abortion cov-
erage, S. 109 would close off Federal
support for abortion that flows outside
of the Hyde-protected regular appro-
priations process.
In addition, it would explicitly en-
sure that Federal healthcare facilities
are not party to abortions and increase
transparency requirements for feder-
ally subsidized healthcare plans.
I am proud to support this important
step forward in protecting Americans’
rights of conscience, and I urge every
one of our colleagues to vote to ad-
vance it.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington.
f
S. 109
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the
fact that the United States is debating
and voting on this bill attacking wom-
en’s healthcare right now is an abso-
lute disgrace.
We are 27 days into President
Trump’s completely unnecessary gov-
ernment shutdown. Workers are not
being paid. Families are huddled
around their tables, wondering which
bills to pay and which expenses to cut.
Our national security is being im-
pacted. Our parks are filling up with
trash. Our economy is losing billions of
dollars. The list goes on. It needs to
end.
I urge my colleagues, vote no against
this bill today that would erode wom-
en’s healthcare and take away our con-
stitutionally protected rights. Demand
that Republican leaders let us vote to
open the government, and then let’s
get back to work getting our country
back on track.
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader is recognized.
f
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. SCHUMER. First, I want to echo
the words of my colleague, our great
ranking member of Health and Human
Services, Senator MURRAY.
Now, look, folks. As the Trump shut-
down drags into its 27th day, the pain
inflicted on our country, our citizens,
and our economy grows. The Council of
Economic Advisers said the shutdown
would hurt our economy twice as much
as originally projected. Experts are
predicting it could wipe out the entire
first quarter of economic growth.
At airports, an understaffed TSA
means longer and longer lines. Yester-
day, the executive vice president of the
National Air Traffic Controllers Asso-
ciation said that flying ‘‘is less safe
today than a month ago, absolutely.’’
Hundreds of thousands of public serv-
ants are suffering. I can give a list of a
long number. President Trump, this
shutdown—your shutdown—has gone
on too long. Why is President Trump
punishing folks like so many of my
constituents who have nothing to do
with disagreements about borders?
If you sense exasperation in my tone,
you are right. We Democrats are exas-
perated. All we want to do is reopen
the government. We are happy to de-
bate border security with the President
and our Republican colleagues—happy
to. But let’s reopen the government.
My Republican friends here, both the
President and Leader MCCONNELL, are
ignoring the overwhelming will of the
American people. We urge our col-
leagues to think about this. We know
that President Trump is not interested
in ending the shutdown. Leader
MCCONNELL knows he has the power to
end the shutdown. The only reason we
are in this prolonged stalemate is that
my friend the Republican leader re-
fuses to take up any legislation to re-
open government. We should do it now.
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.J. RES. 30
Mr. SCHUMER. We spent the past
few days debating the resolution of dis-
approval of the Treasury Department’s
plan to relax sanctions on Russia. We
have made clear that Treasury’s plan is
insufficient and lets Putin and his cro-
nies off the hook. We have made clear
that Putin’s malign activities around
the globe have not abated. We have
made clear that there is no reason to
relieve sanctions on one of our chief
adversaries when there has been no rec-
onciliation and in exchange for noth-
ing.
Earlier this week, 10 brave Repub-
licans joined us on the motion to pro-
ceed and again on cloture, but it was
not enough for passage. So many other
Republicans who have campaigned that
Democrats are not tough enough on
Putin, when they had a chance to be
tough on Putin, ran for the exits. I just
want to let my colleagues know that
the House was different and in this
case far more courageous.
The House passed the same resolu-
tion of disapproval 362 to 53. Repub-
licans by more than a 2-to-1 ratio—
more than 2 to 1—voted to not allow
the loosening of sanctions on
Deripaska’s Rusal, as 136 of them
joined with the unanimous—unani-
mous—support of House Democrats to
pass the resolution.
So two votes—two small votes—stand
in the way of passage here in the Sen-
ate. Let the overwhelming bipartisan
House vote be a message to my Repub-
lican friends in the Senate. We should
pass this resolution. We should not let
Putin get his way simply because Don-
ald Trump has always wanted him to—
too often.
So I am going to shortly reconsider
the resolution before it expires tonight
at midnight. I strongly urge my friend
the leader not to block the request and
give Republican Senators a chance to
change their minds on this incredibly
important motion.

January 17, 2019
So I ask unanimous consent that the
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of Calendar No. 14, H.J. Res.
30; that the joint resolution be consid-
ered read for a third time and the Sen-
ate vote on passage with a 60-vote af-

vening action or debate; and that if the
joint resolution fails to achieve 60
votes for passage, it be returned to the

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 21
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the Senate
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 5, H.R. 21, mak-
ing appropriations for the fiscal year
ending September 30, 2019. I further ask
that the bill be considered read a third
time and passed and that the motion to
reconsider be considered made and laid
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
an objection?
Mr. MCCONNELL. Objection.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Virginia
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I would
like to speak on the preceding motion,
but before I do, I would like to yield
my time to my colleague from New
Mexico.
Mr. UDALL. Senator KAINE is yield-
ing to me to talk about the Interior
Department in the bill. Let me just
thank him for his vigilance. When we
have 800,000 Federal employees across
this country and their families hurt-
ing, he has been vigilant with this. I
know that in the Commonwealth of
Virginia he and Senator WARNER are
very concerned, as are Senator HEIN-
RICH and myself about what is hap-
pening in New Mexico. I want to speak
a little bit about the Interior Depart-
ment bill, where I am the ranking
Democrat.
I rise today to call on this body to
take action and immediately end the
shutdown that is causing tragic con-
sequences in the lives of Americans.
We are on day 27 of the shutdown, the
longest in our Nation’s history.
Every day my constituents in New
Mexico are asking me what are we
doing to end this senseless shutdown.
So I am here on the Senate floor de-
manding that we open the government,
demanding that we do our jobs as a co-
equal branch of government, demand-
ing that we pass bipartisan appropria-
tions bills.
I have the privilege of serving as the
ranking member of the Interior Appro-
priations Subcommittee, and I know
how critical the Interior bill is, par-
ticularly to my home State of New
Mexico and to States across the West
and across the country. The Interior
bill funds basic services like healthcare
and public safety for 2 million Amer-
ican Indians and Alaska Natives
through the Indian Health Service and
the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
This bill keeps our air and water
clean through the work of the Environ-
mental Protection Agency. This bill
protects and preserves national parks
and other treasured public lands and
helps to support small businesses that
depend on them. The Agencies in this
bill fund science, wildlife protection,
energy development, and arts and cul-
tural programs in every State, and
they employ tens of thousands of
Americans. There is no reason why
they should be shuttered. They are
simply too important.
This shutdown is particularly dev-
astating for Indian Country. Every day
the President continues to treat Tribal
programs like hostages for political
gain. By his action he endangers fami-
lies across Indian Country. Multiple
health clinics that serve urban Indians
have closed their doors, forced to turn
hundreds of patients away. Tribal
court programs are in jeopardy. Food
distribution and social service pro-
grams are on the chopping block. Law
enforcement services are stretched to
the breaking point. Thousands of Trib-
al members are furloughed—all to dev-
astating effect.
Indian Country is paying the price
for every day that the President’s reck-
less shutdown continues. These are
people’s lives and livelihoods on the
line. Our government is completely
failing to uphold its trust and treaty
obligations to Native Americans, and
all for what? A wildly expensive and in-
effective wall that this Nation doesn’t
want and a vanity project for a Presi-
dent who is not putting the best inter-
ests of this country first. It doesn’t
make any sense.
We need to pass the Interior appro-
priations bill so we can reopen the en-
tire National Park System, along with
other public lands, and do so safely. Al-
ready, we have heard about the tragic
impacts of the shutdown on our parks,
including thousand-year-old Joshua
trees cut down in California, and fossils
that have been looted at Carlsbad Cav-
erns in my home State of New Mexico.
We can’t let this kind of damage hap-
pen to our most treasured places, and
we must ensure that small businesses
that depend on our public lands—from
fishing guides to gas stations and ho-
tels—are able to thrive and keep our
economy strong.
Across the board, this shutdown is
hurting businesses, contractors, and
Federal workers. Even the President’s
own Council of Economic Advisers has
released figures doubling the expected
impacts to the economy. Think about
that. The President’s own aides admit
this shutdown is worse than they an-
ticipated. This is totally unacceptable,
but it is not too late to change the sit-
uation.
We can end this shutdown today. All
it takes is for enough of my Republican
colleagues and friends to find the cour-
age to join us to pass these appropria-
tions bills and to send a message to the
White House that we need to reopen
the government. I want to say to them,
let’s join together to make sure that
Tribal health clinics are open and Trib-
al law enforcement officers are on pa-
trol.
Let’s work side by side to reopen the
entire National Park System and other
public lands and ensure that there are
enough staff members on the ground to
protect our Nation’s most cherished
national and cultural resources. Let’s
pass these bipartisan appropriations
bills without delay.
I don’t understand how this Chamber
can stand by and watch the dev-
astating effects of this shutdown on
our Nation. In New Mexico alone, we
estimate that there are at least 10,800
Federal workers who are working with-
out pay or are furloughed outright. Na-
tionwide, there are an estimated 800,000
Federal workers and as many as 2 mil-
lion Federal contractors who may be
affected. We are talking about millions
of people’s paychecks being held hos-
tage for a border wall that the Amer-
ican public doesn’t support.
Yesterday I stood on this floor and
talked about the impacts this shut-
down is having on the Ornelas family
of Carlsbad, NM. They are depending
on a paycheck from the Department of
Interior to help keep their family
afloat as they deal with a disabled son
who had two brain surgeries. The
Ornelas family was already dealing
with one of the worst crises a family
can go through, and now they have to
worry about how to pay for basic ne-
cessities. They are just one example of
the lives at stake.
It is not just Federal workers and
Federal contractors. Every single
American relies on the Federal Govern-
ment for essential public safety and se-
curity. The Food and Drug Administra-
tion shut down—contaminated food can
kill thousands. TSA agents and FAA
air traffic controllers we rely on to
keep air traffic safe are unpaid. In a
massive irony, President Trump’s shut-
down means the Department of Home-
land Security is unpaid. There are an
estimated 2,000 New Mexicans we rely
on for border security, international
trade, and immigration work who are
unpaid. This really truly is madness.
For their sake and for the sake of all
Americans who are affected by this
tragic situation, we need to end this
shutdown now. The consequences of in-
action are too great.
Once again, let me thank Senator
KAINE for his passion on this issue, for
his vigilance in terms of bringing this
issue, and fighting with all of us on the
floor.
I yield to Senator KAINE.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S290 January 17, 2019
motion I just made. I will be on the
floor tomorrow and Saturday and next
week—Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thurs-
day—to share stories that have been
shared with me and are being shared
with me every day by Virginians af-
fected and the Agencies the Senator
from New Mexico discussed and others.
Just to clarify, the motion that I
made earlier was to pass a House bill
that is pending before us. It is an ap-
propriation for the remainder of the
fiscal year for the following Depart-
ments and Agencies: Department of In-
terior; Environmental Protection
Agency; Forest Service; Department of
Treasury, including the IRS; Judiciary;
Executive Office of the President—we
are trying to fund the Executive Office
of the President; the District of Colum-
bia; Department of Agriculture, includ-
ing the Food Stamp Program; the Food
and Drug Administration; Department
of Transportation; Department of
Housing and Urban Development; De-
partment of Commerce; Department of
Justice, including the FBI; science-re-
lated Agencies, including NASA; the
Department of State and several re-
lated and independent Agencies.
That was the motion that I made
that was objected to by the majority
leader.
Three items quickly. There are three
levels of surreal illogic to the position
we are in. The first is, we are having a
legitimate debate between Congress
and the President on border security
and immigration reform. That is a very
legitimate debate, in which there are
intellectually respectable differences of
opinion. If we are having a debate
about that, why would we punish the
workers who are charged with admin-
istering the Food Stamp Program?
Why punish workers in the National
Forest and National Parks? Why pun-
ish the citizens who need those serv-
ices? The first level of illogic to the po-
sition we are in is we are punishing
both workers and the citizens who need
services completely unconnected with
the border and immigration reform
issue.
Surreal illogic No. 2. If we are having
a debate about safety and security on
the border, why would we demand Cus-
toms and Border Patrol folks work
without pay? Those who are affected
and who are part of the Agencies deal-
ing with the dispute are, by all ac-
counts, the frontline people who are
dealing with this—immigration judges,
Custom and Border Patrol folks, ICE
agents, DEA agents, the Coast Guard,
which interdicts drugs, FBI, U.S. mar-
shals, BATF agents—why would we
make their lives harder when they are
the safety and security professionals
who are charged with dealing with the
issue we are trying to figure out?
The final level of surreal illogic, as I
yield to my colleague from Indiana, is
this. I want to thank all my colleagues
because a week ago, by unanimous con-
sent, we passed a backpay bill that the
President signed yesterday. Now we
have guaranteed that the Federal
Treasury will write a check for the
paychecks for all of these workers. It is
actually probably going to be more be-
cause to close and restart actually
costs a little bit more. We agreed to
pay backpay in this and any future
shutdown to these workers.
So if we are going to pay them any-
way, why wouldn’t we want them to be
serving Americans instead of being fur-
loughed? If we are going to pay them
anyway—if the Federal Treasury is
going to write that check—wouldn’t it
be better if they are in their offices an-
swering phones, processing food stamp
applications, and serving their fellow
Americans than locked out of their of-
fices?
We bar Federal workers from strik-
ing because of the need for continuous
government operations, but we are
locking them out of their offices while
we have agreed to give them full pay-
ment for the work they would have
been doing had we not locked them
out. That is not fiscally smart.
I yield the floor.

MARCH FOR LIFE
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I rise to
talk about an issue that is very impor-
tant to my constituents in my State of
Indiana. It is also an issue that is very
close to my heart—the sanctity of life.
Tomorrow we know thousands of pro-
life advocates from around the coun-
try, including many Hoosiers, will con-
vene in Washington for the March for
Life. This is the world’s largest annual
pro-life demonstration.
You may not be able to tell this by
watching today’s television or movies,
but there is bipartisan agreement
among most Americans that we must
protect human life. This is no old-fash-
ioned point of view. In fact, a recent
survey of millennials showed that 70
percent supported limits such as paren-
tal notification, blocking abortions at
5 months of pregnancy, and ending gov-
ernment funding for abortion.
In Indiana, concerned citizens from
all corners of the State are fighting
tirelessly to protect pro-life principles.
These are the unsung heroes of the pro-
life movement—those who have dedi-
cated their lives to saving innocent
children. These and other Hoosiers, of
course, elected me to represent their
interests in the Senate, but they also
elected me to represent their values. I
have been proud to work on legislation
that reflects those values.
Already in this new Congress, I have
joined dozens of my Senate colleagues
on a letter to President Trump asking
for a public commitment to only sup-
port pro-life legislative and adminis-
trative policies. To be clear, this Presi-
dent has indeed been supportive of pro-
life policies, but House Democrats have
already indicated they intend to move
forward with pro-abortion legislation
this Congress. We would like the Presi-
dent to let the House know that he is
going to veto any kind of legislation
that doesn’t respect the sanctity of
life.
I have also joined several of my col-
leagues this week to sponsor the No
Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act of
2019, which we just voted on. This bill
would have established a government-
wide statutory prohibition on taxpayer
subsidies for abortion or abortion cov-
erage. Federal taxpayer dollars should
absolutely not be used to fund abor-
tion.
I am incredibly disappointed that my
colleagues didn’t join me in voting to
pass this important legislation today. I
will continue looking for ways to ad-
vance this needed reform.
I am also a cosponsor of the Born-
Alive Abortion Survivors Protection
Act, which ensures that a baby who
survives an abortion will receive the
same treatment as any child naturally
born premature at the very same age.
We must do all we can to protect inno-
cent life.
Before being elected to the Senate, I
sat on the board of directors of the
Hannah House in Bloomington, IN.
This is a maternity home that offers
women loving support during their
pregnancy. I also spent 2 years as a
smalltown attorney in Southern Indi-
ana. During that time, I offered free
legal services to parents who wanted to
adopt. I am passionate about helping
children find loving forever homes and
helping caring adults become parents. I
have come to appreciate firsthand,
through my own life experiences, the
importance of advocating for those who
cannot advocate for themselves.
We are divided on so many issues
today, but protecting the lives of un-
born children should not be one of
those issues. I will continue working
on legislation that advances pro-life
values, and I am hopeful we can soon
turn these actions into law.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
MARCH FOR LIFE
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this
week, folks from all over the country—
all ages, all backgrounds, and all walks
of life—are coming together to cele-
brate and highlight one of the single
most important priorities of this Na-
tion, and that is protecting the unborn.
In fact, tomorrow, nearly 100,000 of
these folks will march right here in
Washington, DC, at the March for Life
rally. In fact, I will be speaking at that
rally tomorrow.
As American citizens, I believe in our
founding principle that all men and all
women are endowed by their Creator
with certain unalienable rights, and
among these are life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness. Every human life
must be valued. Every human life must
be protected from conception until

death. We must stand to protect the
most vulnerable in our society, and
that includes the unborn.
I am grateful that under President
Trump’s leadership and the Repub-
lican-led U.S. Senate, we have deliv-
ered some of the strongest pro-life re-
sults in history. In fact, in the last
Congress, this Republican-led Senate
confirmed 85 conservative judges. That
includes a record-setting 30 circuit
court judges. We also confirmed 53 dis-
trict court judges and two new Su-
preme Court Justices.
I remember when I left the private
sector to come to public service that
when the Senate put a judge on the
bench, that meant these were lifetime
appointments. We can pass laws here.
Laws can be changed in the current
Congress. Laws can be changed in a fu-
ture Congress. But these judges are
lifetime appointments.
Despite the great progress we have
made over the last couple of years,
there is plenty of work to be done. In
fact, just this week, I was grateful and
thankful to see 48 of my Senate col-
leagues join me in sending a letter to
President Trump urging him to stop
any legislation—any legislation—that
is coming out of the House that would
erode pro-life protections.
The good news is, this is a battle we
are winning, and this is a battle we
must absolutely win.
Thank you.
I yield back.

ator from Alaska.
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, a
couple of days ago I came to the floor
to talk about the partial government
shutdown, how it is impacting different
parts of my State—the Great State of
Alaska—and, in particular, how it is
impacting the men and women in the
U.S. Coast Guard.
I think we all recognize as we are
trying to work through this partial
government shutdown that a lot of
Federal workers are being impacted,
but let me talk about the Coast Guard
because I think it is a little different
than almost any other group of Federal
workers.
On Tuesday, these brave men and
women did not receive a paycheck.
They didn’t receive a paycheck, and
they are the only branch of the U.S.
military right now, out there around
the world and around the globe, risking
their lives for the American people,
who are not getting paid. Army, Navy,
Air Force, and Marines—we love them
all. They are working hard. They are
getting paid. The men and women of
the Coast Guard are not getting paid.
That is wrong. That is particularly
wrong. They can’t leave the Coast
Guard. They would get court-
martialed. They are working hard, sav-
ing lives in my State, certainly—in
Alaska—all the time, and they are not
getting paid when the other services
are getting paid.
So what did we do? A number of us,
Democrats and Republicans—almost
one-quarter of the Members of the U.S.
Senate—cosponsored a bill that says:
Let’s pay the Coast Guard. Let’s pay
the Coast Guard right now so they are
treated fairly, like the other men and
women serving in our military.
That was a good start. I was opti-
mistic then. It has been a bit of a roller
coaster ride, but, to be honest, I
couldn’t imagine that this bill
wouldn’t sail through. We are not
going to be able to fix everything right
now, but this is one we can start work-
ing on, on these individual issues, and
there is a lot of talk of doing it.
Last week, I had the opportunity to
raise this with the President and his
administration and the Secretary of
Homeland Security, and we continued
to press this issue all week with the
OMB Director, the Chief of Staff of the
White House, and the President him-
self, and he said this week that he was
going to support the bill. That is im-
portant. Now you have the executive
branch, the President of the United
States, and he will sign it. He said it. I
was in a meeting with him yesterday,
and he said he is 100 percent supportive
of this bill. It is bipartisan. There are
actually more Democrats than Repub-
licans on the bill right now.
What we did, trying to move this
quickly, is we said: All right, the Presi-
dent is going to sign it. We have a
quarter of the Senate. It is a bipartisan
bill. Let’s move it.
We moved to hotline it. What does
that mean? To try to get this bill to be
moved through unanimous consent
through the Senate, a hotline means
you are going to try to move it real
fast and everybody is going to vote on
it. That started today. By noon, every
Republican Member of the U.S. Senate
said: Good to go—cleared, hot. Let’s
pay the men and women of the Coast
Guard.
I had the opportunity to talk to a
local public radio program in Kodiak,
the largest Coast Guard station in the
country. I had the opportunity to say
to my fellow Alaskans that I am pretty
optimistic. We have moved. We have a
lot of cosponsors—25 percent of the
Senate, Democrats and Republicans—
and the President of the United States.
Bingo, Republicans have said we are
good to go on it. I have certainly start-
ed working with some of my Demo-
cratic colleagues who are also opti-
mistic. Why would we block this? Why
would we block this? Remember, they
are the only men and women in the
U.S. military not getting paid right
now, and we have a solution.
So I come to the floor, and I hate to
admit it because 2 hours ago I was
pretty optimistic, but I am getting
word that my colleagues—the Demo-
crats and the minority leader—are now
saying: Maybe we are just going to
block this. I am not sure why. Nobody
has come down here to say why. We are
running the hotline on the Democratic
side. So maybe that is just a rumor. I
hope it is just a rumor. Why would you
block it? Come on, my colleagues on
the other side. Why would you block
it? We are not going to fix everything
tonight, but we could fix this tonight.
Let me talk a little bit about my
State. Some of you have probably seen
the ‘‘Deadliest Catch’’ and those kind
of shows about Alaska. Look at the
men and women who are out there
keeping our fishermen—American fish-
ermen—safe. On average, every month
in the State of Alaska the Coast Guard
saves 22 lives—in 1 month, on average,
in one State—and it assists 53 people,
reports and investigates 25 maritime
casualties, conducts close to 20 secu-
rity boardings and over 20 security pa-
trols. If you are in trouble on the high
seas in Alaska, which is a bad place to
be, the seas are never too rough or the
skies never too dismal for the Coast
Guard to come out and rescue you. We
have seen it time and again, but it is
not just in Alaska. It is all over the
country, and it is all over the world.
I talked to the Commandant of the
Coast Guard just yesterday. I said: Mr.
Commandant, Admiral, I think we are
close. The President is good to go. I
think most of the Senators are good to
go. The bill has 25 cosponsors.
He reminded me that he has men and
women in the Coast Guard deployed in
the Persian Gulf doing anti-piracy op-
erations alongside U.S. Marines and
U.S. Navy personnel—right now, in the
Persian Gulf, Marines, Coast Guard,
and Navy—and guess who is not getting
paid. Does anyone think that should be
a tolerated situation? The answer is
no. The answer is no.
Again, I hope this is a rumor, and
that the hotline is happening right now
on the Democratic side. We have
cleared it—good to go. Every Repub-
lican has signed off on this. I hope that
this is just a rumor—that tonight the
Democrats will clear this and we will
get it to the House. The Coast Guard
said they can start cutting checks
again within 24 hours. The President
will sign this. So there should be no
reason not to do this.
The partial government shutdown is
negatively impacting Federal workers.
The President’s request, in my view,
for border security is imminently rea-
sonable. I hope the Speaker will view it
that way. A lot of her members are. We
are all working for this. We are all
working for a solution. Senator JOHN-
SON put out a bill that I joined as a co-
sponsor that would immediately pay
all workers who are currently working
without pay. This would expand the
idea of what we are doing with the
Coast Guard bill. I think it is a good
idea. That is a start, but the Coast
Guard bill right now has momentum. It
has momentum.
We could get this done in 24 hours. It
is not a complete solution, but we have
the White House, and it should be the
Senate and, hopefully, the House get-
ting ready to find a solution for at
least for some of the men and women
in the Federal workforce.
But as I like to emphasize, they are
not just any Federal workers. All of

them are important—there is no
doubt—but when you are the only
members of the military not getting
paid for risking your lives for your
country and we can fix it here tonight
in the Senate, that is what we should
be doing.
I certainly hope this bill isn’t being
blocked unreasonably. As I mentioned,
it is not a complete solution, but it is
the start of a solution. For the life of
me, I can’t understand why this bill
would be blocked.
More importantly, the men and
women of the Coast Guard will not un-
derstand why this bill is being blocked.
Communities that support and depend
on the Coast Guard—like Kodiak, AK—
will not understand why this bill is
being blocked. These young men and
women, who love their country and
have chosen to serve and protect us,
are not going to understand why this
bill is being blocked tonight.
I don’t want to use the word plead,
but I am asking my colleagues on the
Democratic side to do the right thing
and pass this bill tonight. Every single
American who is aware of this situa-
tion knows that it is inequitable when
the other members of the military—
who are out there risking their lives
just like the men and women of the
Coast Guard—are getting paid and the
men and women of the Coast Guard
aren’t.
We are on the verge of a solution.
Passing this bill will take care of at
least one issue that we are all trying to
resolve. Again, I urge my Democratic
colleagues—because all of my Repub-
lican colleagues have already passed
this bill in the hotline. I urge my col-
leagues to take up this bill, do the
right thing, and support the men and
women of the Coast Guard, who are not
being treated equal to their brothers
and sisters in the other branches of the
military.
Until then, I am going to continue to
fight for this. I am going to continue to
raise the issue. We have made a lot of
progress, including getting the White
House and the President on board and
getting all of our Members here on the
Republican side of the Senate on board.
I am hopeful, with more advocacy and
more reasoning with my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle, that we will
also get there, move this to the House
quickly, and get the men and women of
the Coast Guard the paychecks they
are needing.
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT
COMMANDER ZACHARY CRESS
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I
wish to recognize Lieutenant Com-
mander Zachary Cress of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion—NOAA—Commissioned Officer
Corps, who has served as a fellow on
the Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation Committee for the past year.
I want to thank Lieutenant Com-
mander Cress for his hard work from
which the committee greatly benefited.
His expertise as a ship driver and man-
ager of our Nation’s marine resources
has meaningfully informed the com-
mittee’s efforts. He has worked on sev-
eral pieces of legislation that have be-
come law, including the National Inte-
grated Drought Information System
Reauthorization Act of 2018. His con-
tributions have enabled NOAA to carry
out its missions more effectively.
Again, I would like to extend my sin-
cere thanks and appreciation to Lieu-
tenant Commander Cress for all of the
fine work he has done and for his con-
tinued service to our nation. I wish
him success in the years to come.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself,
Ms. HARRIS, Mr. LEAHY, Mr.
BENNET, Ms. HIRONO, Mr.
BLUMENTHAL, Mr. BOOKER, Mrs.
GILLIBRAND, Mr. WYDEN, Mr.
MERKLEY, Mr. UDALL, and Mr.
SANDERS):
S. 175. A bill to improve agricultural
job opportunities, benefits, and secu-
rity for aliens in the United States,
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary.
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I
rise today to reintroduce legislation
that would shield farmworkers from
deportation and put them on a path to
earned legal status and eventual citi-
zenship.
By protecting farmworkers from de-
portation, this bill would achieve two
goals: ensuring that hardworking im-
migrants don’t live in fear and that
California’s agriculture industry has
the workforce it needs to survive.
Under the Agricultural Worker Pro-
gram Act, farmworkers who have
worked in agriculture for at least 100
days in each of the past 2 years may
earn lawful ‘‘blue card’’ status. Farm-
workers who maintain blue card status
for the next 3 or 5 years, depending on
the total hours worked in agriculture,
would be eligible to adjust to a green
card or legal permanent residency.
This would provide them with a path to
citizenship.
Everywhere I travel in California, I
hear from farmers, growers and pro-
ducers from all industries—wine, cit-
rus, fruit and tree nuts, dairy—that
there aren’t enough workers. Farm
labor is performed almost exclusively
by immigrants—fact that should sur-
prise no one. In fact, over 90 percent of
California’s crop workers are immi-
grants, and half are unauthorized.
Despite their significant contribu-
tions to California’s economy and com-
munities, farmworkers are now a pri-
ority for deportation under this admin-
istration’s shameful policies. We sim-
ply must protect the families who help
put food on our tables. By providing a
path to citizenship for these workers
and their families, the Agricultural
Worker Program Act will preserve our
agricultural system. This bill will also
protect vulnerable workers who should
not have to live in fear of becoming
easy enforcement targets.
It is time to get started on solutions
for agricultural communities across
the country. Law-abiding workers
should not have to fear deportation,
but should have a path to citizenship
that recognizes their enormous con-
tribution to American prosperity and
society. Employers should not have to
fear that their labor force will be un-
able to return to work as a result of de-
portation. The Agricultural Worker
Program Act provides the security and
stability for our farmworkers that is
necessary to keep the industry strong.
I would like to thank Representative
LOFGREN in the House for working with
me to introduce this legislation today
in both chambers. I invite my col-
leagues in the Senate to join me in co-
sponsoring the bill and preventing the
deportation of those who work so hard
to put food on our tables.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S295
January 17, 2019
By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr.
GARDNER, Mr. REED, Mr. GRA-
HAM, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr.
RUBIO, Mr. COONS, Ms. COLLINS,
and Mr. DURBIN):
S.J. Res. 4. A joint resolution requir-
ing the advice and consent of the Sen-
ate or an Act of Congress to suspend,
terminate, or withdraw the United
States from the North Atlantic Treaty
and authorizing related litigation, and
for other purposes; to the Committee
on Foreign Relations.
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President. I regret it
is necessary to re-introduce legislation
that prevents a President from with-
drawing the United States from NATO.
Recent reports confirm that President
Trump has repeatedly proposed doing
so over the past year. In addition to
concern over U.S. national security,
this threat to withdraw also raises im-
portant constitutional issues. What is
the role of Congress in treaties—not
just entering into them, but also leav-
ing them? Particularly with a treaty
obligation that is as central to U.S. se-
curity as NATO—as repeatedly af-
firmed by Congress—no president
should or can be allowed to unilater-
ally withdraw without the advice and
consent of the Senate.
Our allies with whom we have fought
alongside since World War II and ear-
lier in some cases, are questioning our
allegiance for the first time in the his-
tory of the modern international order.
President Trump has called our Euro-
pean allies ‘‘foes’’ while aligning him-
self with a brutal authoritarian, Vladi-
mir Putin, over the professional assess-
ment of the U.S. intelligence commu-
nity. Last year, at the NATO summit
in Brussels, the President insulted our
allies and threatened to leave the alli-
ance if defense spending was not
ramped up. The President has also
questioned the U.S. commitment to
NATO’s mutual defense provision and
we still do not know what he discussed
with President Putin at their meeting
in Helsinki. As such, we are forced to
ask what options we have to preserve
U.S. membership in the primary tool of
peace and stability for the last 70
years, NATO.
In response to the only invocation of
Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, more
than 1,100 servicemembers from our
NATO allies have given their lives
fighting alongside the United States.
This is a sacrifice that should not be
cast aside by our President who con-
tinues to depict the alliance as a pro-
tection racket and ‘‘obsolete.’’ While
we must continue to press every coun-
try to increase defense spending to
meet the agreed-upon goal of 2 percent
of GDP by 2024, the President should
not disparage our allies and threaten
NATO withdrawal. Unfortunately,
without action from Congress, he
might just do so. For this reason, we
must firmly state opposition, use our
constitutional powers of advice and
consent and of the purse to block any
withdrawal and preemptively authorize
legal proceedings to challenge any de-
cision to terminate U.S. membership.
The legislation I am introducing
today along with Senators GARDNER,
REED, GRAHAM, COONS, RUBIO,
BLUMENTHAL, and COLLINS, is a bipar-
tisan message to the President and the
necessary tool needed to block this
President, or any President, from uni-
laterally terminating the NATO trea-
ty. It is the position of the Senate, sup-
ported by this Resolution, and previous
resolutions, including the original vote
of 82–13 in 1949 to give the Senate’s ad-
vice and consent to join NATO, that
the United States through its elected
officials is unequivocally opposed to
the U.S. withdrawing from NATO.
I am proud to have bipartisan sup-
port for this bill to ensure that the
safety of the American people is
prioritized through our continued
membership in NATO. Lastly, sup-
porting this bill would fittingly honor
the late Senator John McCain, one of
the fiercest advocates for NATO, who
co-sponsored this bill last year—one of
the last bills he co-sponsored. I strong-
ly encourage my colleagues in both the
Senate and the House of Representa-
tive to support this legislation.

Whereas section 104(f) of the Foreign As-
sistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b(f)) (com-
monly referred to as the ‘‘Helms amend-
ment’’) states that no foreign assistance
funds may be used to pay for the perform-
ance of abortion as a method of family plan-
ning or to motivate or coerce any person to
practice abortions;
Whereas section 518 of the Foreign Oper-
ations, Export Financing, and Related Pro-
grams Appropriations Act, 2006 (Public Law
109–102; 119 Stat. 2202) (commonly referred to
as the ‘‘Siljander Amendment’’) states that
no foreign assistance funds may be used to
lobby for or against abortion;
Whereas, in 1984, President Ronald Reagan
established the ‘‘Mexico City Policy,’’ which
prohibits foreign aid for family planning pur-
poses from being given to foreign nongovern-
mental organizations that perform abortions
or actively promote abortion as a method of
family planning, regardless of the source of
funding;
Whereas, upon assuming office on January
20, 1989, President George H.W. Bush contin-
ued to enforce the Mexico City Policy as es-
tablished by President Reagan;
Whereas the Mexico City Policy was rees-
tablished on January 22, 2001, by President
George W. Bush;
Whereas, on January 23, 2009, President
Barack Obama rescinded the Mexico City
Policy;
Whereas, on January 23, 2017, President
Donald J. Trump reestablished the Mexico
City Policy and directed the Secretary of
State to apply the policy to all Federal glob-
al health assistance; and
Whereas the Department of State modern-
ized the Mexico City Policy on May 15, 2017,
renamed ‘‘Protecting Life in Global Health
Assistance,’’ to cover all health assistance
provided abroad by a Federal agency, includ-
ing the United States Agency for Inter-

therefore, be it
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate

Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr. MENENDEZ, Ms.
HARRIS, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, and Mr.
RUBIO) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations:
S. RES. 23
Whereas thousands of children in the
United States have been abducted from the
United States by parents, separating those
children from their parents who remain in
the United States;
Whereas it is illegal under section 1204 of
title 18, United States Code, to remove, or
attempt to remove, a child from the United
States or retain a child (who has been in the
United States) outside of the United States
with the intent to obstruct the lawful exer-
cise of parental rights;
Whereas more than 9,127 children experi-
enced international parental child abduction
between 2008 and 2015;
Whereas, during 2017, one or more cases of
international parental child abduction in-
volving children who are citizens of the
United States were identified in 105 coun-
tries around the world;
Whereas the United States is a party to the
Convention on the Civil Aspects of Inter-
national Child Abduction, done at the Hague,
October 25, 1980 (TIAS 11670) (referred to in
this preamble as the ‘‘Hague Convention on
Abduction’’), which—
(1) supports the prompt return of wrongly
removed or retained children; and
(2) calls for all participating parties to re-
spect parental custody rights;
Whereas the majority of children who were
abducted from the United States have yet to
be reunited with their custodial parents;
Whereas, during 2017, Argentina, the Baha-
mas, Brazil, China, the Dominican Republic,
Ecuador, India, Japan, Jordan, Morocco,
Peru, and the United Arab Emirates were
identified under the Sean and David Gold-
man International Child Abduction Preven-
tion and Return Act of 2014 (22 U.S.C. 9101 et
seq.) as engaging in a pattern of noncompli-
ance;
Whereas the Supreme Court of the United
States has recognized that family abduc-
tion—
(1) is a form of child abuse with potentially
‘‘devastating consequences for a child’’,
which may include negative impacts on the
physical and mental well-being of the child;
and
(2) can cause a child to ‘‘experience a loss
of community and stability, leading to lone-
liness, anger, and fear of abandonment’’;
Whereas, according to the 2010 Report on
Compliance with the Hague Convention on
the Civil Aspects of International Child Ab-
duction by the Department of State, re-
search shows that an abducted child is at
risk of significant short- and long-term prob-
lems, including ‘‘anxiety, eating problems,
nightmares, mood swings, sleep disturb-
ances, [and] aggressive behavior’’;
Whereas international parental child ab-
duction has devastating emotional con-
sequences for the child and for the parent
from whom the child is separated;
Whereas the United States has a history of
promoting child welfare through institutions
including—
(1) in the Department of Health and
Human Services, the Children’s Bureau of
the Administration for Children and Fami-
lies; and
(2) in the Department of State, the Office
of Children’s Issues of the Bureau of Con-
sular Affairs;
Whereas Congress has signaled a commit-
ment to ending international parental child
abduction by enacting the International
Child Abduction Remedies Act (22 U.S.C. 9001
et seq.), the International Parental Kidnap-
ping Crime Act of 1993 (Public Law 103–173),
which enacted section 1204 of title 18, United
States Code, and the Sean and David Gold-
man International Child Abduction Preven-
tion and Return Act of 2014 (22 U.S.C. 9101 et
seq.);
Whereas the Senate adopted Senate Reso-
lution 543, 112th Congress, on December 4,
2012, which—
(1) condemns international parental child
abduction;
(2) urges countries identified by the De-
partment of State as noncompliant with the
Hague Convention on Abduction to fulfill the
commitment those countries made to imple-
ment such treaty; and
(3) expresses the sense of the Senate that
the United States should—
(A) pursue the return, by all appropriate
means, of each child abducted by a parent
to another country;
(B) if a child is abducted by a parent and
not returned to the United States, facili-
tate access to the abducted child for the
parent remaining in the United States; and
(C) ‘‘where appropriate, seek the extra-
dition of the parent that abducted the
child’’;
Whereas the Senate adopted Senate Reso-
lution 431, 115th Congress, on April 19, 2018,
which—
(1) raises awareness and promotes edu-
cation about international parental child ab-
duction;
(2) recognizes the impacts on children who
are victims of international parental abduc-
tions; and
(3) expresses the sense of the Senate that
the United States should—
(A) continue to raise awareness and op-
position on international parental child
abduction;
(B) facilitate access to the abducted
child for the parent remaining in the
United States; and
(C) urge countries to comply with the re-
quest to bring children home to the United
States;
Whereas all 50 States and the District of
Columbia have enacted laws criminalizing
parental kidnapping;
Whereas, in 2017, the Prevention Branch of
the Office of Children’s Issues of the Depart-
ment of State—
(1) fielded more than 3,500 inquiries from
the general public relating to preventing a
child from being removed from the United
States; and
(2) enrolled more than 4,404 children in the
Children’s Passport Issuance Alert Program,
which—
(A) is one of the most important tools of
the Department of State for preventing
international parental child abductions;
and
(B) allows the Office of Children’s Issues
to contact the enrolling parent or legal
guardian to verify whether the parental
consent requirement has been met when a
passport application has been submitted
for an enrolled child;
Whereas, the Department of State cannot
track the ultimate destination of a child
through the use of the passport of the child
issued by the Department of State if the
child is transported to a third country after
departing from the United States;
Whereas a child who is a citizen of the
United States may have another nationality
and may travel using a passport issued by
another country, which—
(1) increases the difficulty in determining
the whereabouts of the child; and
(2) makes efforts to prevent abductions
more critical; and
Whereas, in 2017, the Department of Home-
land Security, in coordination with the Pre-
vention Branch of the Office of Children’s
Issues of the Department of State, enrolled
210 children in a program aimed at pre-
venting international parental child abduc-
tion:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) recognizes and observes ‘‘Countering
International Parental Child Abduction
Month’’ during the period beginning on April
1, 2019, and ending on April 30, 2019, to raise
awareness of, and opposition to, inter-
national parental child abduction; and
(2) urges the United States to continue
playing a leadership role in raising aware-
ness about the devastating impacts of inter-
national parental child abduction by edu-
cating the public about the negative emo-
tional, psychological, and physical con-
sequences to children and parents victimized
by international parental child abduction.

SENATE RESOLUTION 24—SUP-
PORTING A ROBUST AND MOD-

THE VALUE OF THE NUCLEAR
TRIAD OF THE UNITED STATES
Mr. HOEVEN (for himself, Mr. BAR-
RASSO, Mr. CRAMER, Mr. DAINES, Mr.
ENZI, and Mr. TESTER) submitted the
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Armed
Services:
S. RES. 24
Whereas land-based intercontinental bal-
listic missiles (in this preamble referred to
as ‘‘ICBMs’’) have been a critical part of the
strategic deterrent of the United States for 6
decades in conjunction with air and sea-
based strategic delivery systems;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S297
January 17, 2019
Whereas President John F. Kennedy re-
ferred to the deployment of the first Minute-
man missile during the Cuban Missile Crisis
as his ‘‘ace in the hole’’;
Whereas the Minuteman III missile entered
service in 1970 and is still deployed in 2019,
well beyond its originally intended service
life;
Whereas the ICBM force of the United
States peaked at more than 1,200 deployed
missiles during the Cold War;
Whereas the ICBM force of the United
States currently consists of approximately
400 Minuteman III missiles deployed across
450 operational missile silos, each carrying a
single warhead;
Whereas the Russian Federation currently
deploys at least 300 ICBMs with multiple
warheads loaded on each missile and has an-
nounced plans to replace its Soviet-era sys-
tems with modernized ICBMs;
Whereas the People’s Republic of China
currently deploys at least 75 ICBMs and
plans to grow its ICBM force through the de-
ployment of modernized, road-mobile ICBMs
that carry multiple warheads;
Whereas the Russian Federation and the
People’s Republic of China deploy nuclear
weapons across a variety of platforms in ad-
dition to their ICBM forces;
Whereas numerous countries possess or are
seeking to develop nuclear weapons capabili-
ties that pose challenges to the nuclear de-
terrence of the United States;
Whereas the nuclear deterrent of the
United States is comprised of a triad of de-
livery systems for nuclear weapons, includ-
ing submarine-launched ballistic missiles (in
this preamble referred to as ‘‘SLBMs’’), air-
delivered gravity bombs and cruise missiles,
and land-based ballistic missiles that provide
interlocking and mutually reinforcing at-
tributes that enhance strategic deterrence;
Whereas weakening one leg of the triad
limits the deterrent value of the other legs
of the triad;
Whereas, in the nuclear deterrent of the
United States, ICBMs provide commanders
with the most prompt response capability,
SLBMs provide stealth and survivability,
and aircraft armed with nuclear weapons
provide flexibility;
Whereas the ICBM force of the United
States forces any would-be attacker to con-
front more than 400 discrete targets, thus
creating an effectively insurmountable tar-
geting problem for a potential adversary;
Whereas the size, dispersal, and global
reach of the ICBM force of the United States
ensures that no adversary can escalate a cri-
sis beyond the ability of the United States to
respond;
Whereas a potential attacker would be
forced to expend far more warheads to de-
stroy the ICBMs of the United States than
the United States would lose in an attack,
because of the deployment of a single war-
head on each ICBM of the United States;
Whereas the ICBM force provides a per-
sistent deterrent capability that reinforces
strategic stability;
Whereas ICBMs are the cheapest delivery
system for nuclear weapons for the United
States to operate and maintain;
Whereas United States Strategic Command
has validated military requirements for the
unique capabilities of ICBMs;
Whereas, in a 2014 analysis of alternatives,
the Air Force concluded that replacing the
Minuteman III missile would provide up-
graded capabilities at lower cost when com-
pared with extending the service life of the
Minuteman III missile; and
Whereas the Minuteman III replacement
program, known as the ground-based stra-
tegic deterrent, is expected to provide a
land-based strategic deterrent capability for
5 decades after the program enters service:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) recognizes that land-based interconti-
nental ballistic missiles (in this resolution
referred to as ‘‘ICBMs’’) have certain charac-
teristics, including responsiveness, persist-
ence, and dispersal, that enhance strategic
stability and magnify the deterrent value of
the air and sea-based legs of the nuclear
triad of the United States;
(2) emphasizes the role that ICBMs have
played and continue to play in deterring at-
tacks on the United States and its allies;
(3) observes that while arms control agree-
ments have reduced the size of the ICBM
force of the United States, adversaries of the
United States continue to enhance, enlarge,
and modernize their ICBM forces;
(4) supports the modernization of the ICBM
force of the United States through the
ground-based strategic deterrent program;
(5) highlights that ICBMs have the lowest
operation, maintenance, and modernization
costs of any part of the nuclear deterrent of
the United States; and
(6) opposes efforts to unilaterally reduce
the size of the ICBM force of the United
States or delay the implementation of the
ground-based strategic deterrent program,
which would degrade the deterrent capabili-
ties of a fully operational and modernized
nuclear triad.

PHYLLIS WEBSTER 90TH
BIRTHDAY
HON. DANIEL WEBSTER
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 17, 2019
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam Speaker,
I am honored to recognize Phyllis Womack
Webster on the occasion of her 90th birthday.
A lifelong resident of St. Albans, West Vir-
ginia, Phyllis is known for her joyful approach
to life and compassionate and kind nature. A
member of St. Albans Baptist Church for more
than half a century, Phyllis has impacted many
lives for the better through her ministry with
her church and the American Baptist Associa-
tion. She was recognized in 2010 for her dedi-
cated involvement in her church with the
American Heritage Award.
Her outreach to people extended beyond
her church family. Her door has always been
open to host family, friends or anyone in need
of a good listening ear or warm meal. Thanks
to her hospitable nature, I would not be sur-
prised if, as Scripture says, she hosted Angels
unaware.
She can, and has made everyone and any-
one feel special. Her love for family and peo-
ple and sharp mind, she can remember the
names of every family member through mul-
tiple generations. Phyllis’ life, efforts and love
for others are an example for us all of a life
well-lived serving others.
It is my pleasure to recognize my beloved
Aunt Phyllis on this momentous occasion. I
wish her a very happy 90th birthday and may
God continue to bless her.

HONORING SUPERINTENDENT
MICHAEL WATKINS
HON. JIMMY PANETTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 17, 2019
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the Santa Cruz County Super-
intendent of Schools, Michael Watkins, on his
retirement after serving the Santa Cruz County
Office of Education since 1980. Mr. Watkins
was the first African American elected as a
School Superintendent in the State of Cali-
fornia in 2006. An outstanding citizen and edu-
cator, Superintendent Watkins made an unpar-
alleled impact in the educational community of
Santa Cruz County through 35 years of serv-
ice.
Superintendent Watkins began his career
with the Santa Cruz County Office of as the
Learning Handicapped Program Specialist, a
position which set the tone for Superintendent
Watkins’ career as a visionary advocate for
change and accessibility in education. After
one year, he was offered the role of General
Administrator in charge of the Special Edu-
cation Programs for Santa Cruz County,
where he worked to mainstream educational
opportunities for students with special needs
across the district. In addition, Superintendent
Watkins pioneered and developed community
and vocational programming through his role
as Director of Alternative Education. Under
Superintendent Watkins’s leadership, the
schools he developed have received acclaim
and statewide recognition for their commitment
to excellence. With the backing of his tremen-
dous record as an educator, Michael Watkins
was elected Santa Cruz County Super-
intendent of Schools in 2006 and is currently
serving his third term.
Superintendent Watkins’ expertise in edu-
cation also led to his appointment by the Cali-
fornia Senate Rules Committee to the Cali-
fornia Collaborative for Educational Excellence
and the Special Education Task Force. He has
also held statewide office as President of the
Juvenile Courts, Community, and Alternative
School Administrators of California for three
years. In addition to his service in education,
Superintendent Watkins has been an exem-
plary citizen and community member. He has
coached multiple youth sports and sits on sev-
eral significant local boards.
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to recog-
nize the dedication and work of Super-
intendent Watkins. I ask my distinguished col-
leagues to join me in recognizing Super-
intendent Watkins and to congratulate him on
his well-earned retirement. I extend my ear-
nest appreciation to Superintendent Watkins
for his service to our community.

RECOGNIZING ALICJA EDWARDS
OF EUREKA
HON. GREG GIANFORTE
OF MONTANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 17, 2019
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Alicja Edwards of Eureka, a
Montana artist, author, and World War II ref-
ugee, who overcame the atrocities of war and
recorded her family’s journey as part of the
historic diaspora of the Polish people.
When she was a teenager, Alicja’s small
town in eastern Poland came under attack by
Nazi Germany and suffered a brutal Soviet oc-
cupation. She and her family were forced into
a Soviet gulag where they endured mistreat-
ment, illness, and hunger.
Three years later, Alicja and thousands of
other Poles were exiled to Iran. It was there
where she met American Army Lieutenant Er-
nest Edwards who she married in 1945. The
couple raised two children, lived in Japan,
France, and America, and were married for 50
years before Ernest’s passing.
Alicja is renowned for her memoires, And
God Was Our Witness and They Called Us
D.P.’s, that detailed the suffering of her family
and hundreds of thousands of Poles displaced
during and after World War II.
In And God Was Our Witness, she de-
scribes the value of freedom and liberty:
‘‘Priceless Freedom has never been per-
ceived or truly understood by anyone, till it
was lost or forcibly taken away. Only then,
one becomes aware of the magnitude of its
potency and power in directing one’s life and
fate.’’
Alicja is a noted artist and owns an antique
and art shop in Eureka, where she continues
to paint, play the piano, and inspire others.
Madam Speaker, for her indomitable re-
solve, strength and courage, and her inspiring
memoires of the Polish diaspora, I recognize
Alicja Edwards for her spirit of Montana.

IN RECOGNITION OF DENTON
COUNTY COMMISSIONER BOBBIE
MITCHELL
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 17, 2019
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Denton County Commis-
sioner Bobbie Mitchell, who will receive the
2019 Dr. Bettye Myers Humanitarian Award on
January 19, 2019 after more than 30 years of
dedicated service to Denton County.
Commissioner Mitchell has served her fel-
low North Texans in a range of leadership
roles since 1985, when she began her tenure
on the Zoning Board of Adjustment. During the
last three decades, she served on the
Lewisville Planning and Zoning Commission,
as Mayor Pro Tem, and on the Lewisville City
Council. A resident of Lewisville since 1971,
she led the city as its mayor from 1993 to
2000 before being elected as a Denton Coun-
ty Commissioner.
During her many years as a devoted public
servant, Commissioner Mitchell undoubtably
has made Lewisville a better place to work
and live. In addition to her official service, she
has had a significant impact on more than 30
nonprofit organizations in our community.
A longtime supporter of the United Way of
Denton County, Commissioner Mitchell was a
charter appointee to two of the organization’s
key initiatives: the Denton County Behavioral
Health Leadership Team in 2016 and the Den-
ton County Homelessness Leadership Team
in 2017. She is the sixth recipient of the Dr.
Bettye Myers Humanitarian Award, which was
established by the board of directors and life-
time members of United Way of Denton Coun-
ty in 2014 to recognize outstanding community
leadership, philanthropy, and impact.
On a personal note, I have had the good
fortune of knowing Commissioner Mitchell
since I began my medical practice in 1981.
Throughout my medical career and my time in
public service, whether solicited or not, she
has never hesitated to provide wise counsel
and guidance.
It is a privilege to recognize my friend, Com-
missioner Mitchell, for her dedication and com-
mitment to her fellow North Texans, and I con-
gratulate her on this well-earned honor.

RECOGNIZING LTC BRAD CARVER
ON HIS RETIREMENT FROM MILI-
TARY SERVICE
HON. BARRY LOUDERMILK
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 17, 2019
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, on No-
vember 22, 2018, my friend William Bradley
Carver retired from 28 years of service in U.S.
Army Reserve. Today, I rise to pay tribute to
Brad, a leader in the 11th Congressional Dis-
trict of Georgia, and a man who embodies the
spirit of public service.
Brad was born in Valdosta, Georgia, the
only child to Billy and JoAnn Carver, whom he
has made proud by his multitude of life ac-
complishments thus far. Brad graduated from
high school as Salutatorian and was voted
‘‘Most Likely to Succeed’’ due to his many
achievements, including serving as a high
school surrogate speaker for President
George H.W. Bush’s 1988 campaign. He con-
tinued his education at Duke University as an
ROTC cadet, and graduated with Honors
earning his Bachelor of Arts in Political
Science. He later earned his M.B.A. and J.D.
from the University of Georgia.
While attending law school, Brad took a hia-
tus to serve as a 1st Lieutenant in the 341st
A.G. Company in support of Operation Joint
Endeavor and Operation Joint Guard, Tuzla,
Bosnia. He was promoted to Captain in 2000
and served as Deputy Chief of Staff for Per-
sonnel of the 335th Theater Signal Command
at Camp Doha, Kuwait and Camp Bucca, lraq
in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and
Operation Iraqi Freedom. Brad was awarded
the Bronze Star Medal for Exceptionally Meri-
torious Service. Brad continued his service in
the U.S. Army Reserve for an additional 15
years, elevating to the rank of Lieutenant
Colonel.
Brad has also been serving the public by
impacting conservative public policy and in
supporting his beloved Republican Party. Brad
has been engaged in local, statewide, and na-
tional Republican campaigns for the past 24
years. He has served as an elected officer in
the Buckhead Young Republicans, Atlanta
Young Republicans, Fulton County Republican
Party, 11th Congressional District Republican
Committee, and on the board for the Georgia
Republican Party Foundation. Brad has also
held gubernatorial appointments on the Geor-
gia Board of Corrections and as Special Exec-
utive Counsel for the commission on water
issues.
In 2006, Brad became a partner at the law
offices of Hall Booth Smith, P.C., serving as
senior managing director of government af-
fairs. He was chosen as a James Magazine
Top 4 Rising Star (2010) and one of Georgia
Trend Magazine Top 40 Under 40 (2011).
Brad married Michelle in 2007 and their two
sons, William Bradley Carver, Jr. (7) and Wes-
ley Thomas Carver (4), regularly attend polit-
ical events with their parents.
On behalf of Georgia’s 11th Congressional
District and the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, I commend Brad for his service
to his community, state and nation, and con-
gratulate him upon his retirement from the
U.S. Army Reserve. We are fortunate to have
a man such as Brad Carver in Georgia’s 11th
Congressional District.
IN HONOR OF MILBRA DOLORES
WALTERS MATHIAS
HON. KEVIN BRADY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 17, 2019
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today I rise to
recognize and honor the life of an amazing
member of our community, Milbra Dolores
Walters Mathias, who passed away on Janu-
ary 3, 2019 in Conroe, Texas.
Born on January 16, 1923 in Ace, Texas,
Dolores lived a determined life. Prior to retiring
in Montgomery, Texas, Dolores spent time in
the banking industry and later ran a dry clean-
ing business with her husband in Houston,
Texas. Beyond her professional endeavors,
she also led a service-oriented life with the
goal of improving the community around her.
One of her greatest joys was the community
she found at the Montgomery United Meth-
odist Church, where Dolores was a longtime
and active member.
To those who knew Dolores, it comes as no
surprise that she spent much of her retirement
serving those in need. Dolores took genuine
pleasure in being around people, and she
found great satisfaction in helping others. She
served in the Volunteer Auxiliary of Conroe
Regional Hospital for several years and later
as a Veterans Administration Volunteer at the
Conroe VA Clinic. Here, Dolores dedicated
over 9,500 volunteer hours to our veterans—
a remarkable accomplishment, and one Dolo-
res was extremely proud of. In recognition of
her kindness, selflessness, and thoughtful-
ness, she was rightfully awarded the Presi-
dent’s Lifetime Achievement Award. This pres-
tigious award highlights those like Dolores
who go above and beyond to give back to
their community.
She is survived by her nieces, Patsy Jack-
son, Betty Vanya and Charlotte Henner; neph-
ew, Harold Stegall; and great nephews,
Larence Jackson and Lynn Stegall; daughter-
in-law, Joan Mathias; granddaughters, Nicole
Panneton and Renee Mathias; and great
grandchildren, Cooper and Ava.
While we mourn with her family, we also
celebrate Dolores’ life and her remarkable leg-
acy of service. She was truly a joy to all who
had the privilege of meeting her, and I know
I join her family, friends, and the entire Eighth
District of Texas in honoring her extraordinary
life and her unwavering devotion to our vet-
erans, her community, her friends, and her
family. Dolores will be greatly missed.

INTRODUCTION OF HOUSE CON-
CURRENT RESOLUTION EX-
PRESSING CONGRESS’ SUPPORT
FOR PROVIDING TEMPORARY
PROTECTED STATUS TO HAITIAN
NATIONALS RESIDING IN THE
UNITED STATES AT THE TIME
HURRICANE MATTHEW HIT HAITI
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 17, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in support of my House concurrent reso-
lution, which expresses Congress’ support for
extending Temporary Protected Status (TPS)
to Haitian Nationals who resided in the United
States when Hurricane Matthew hit Haiti on
October 4, 2016.
Hurricane Matthew was the worst hurricane
to hit the country in 50 years. It took the lives
of over 1,000 people and directly affected 2.1
million Haitians with the internal displacement
of 175,000 people and leaving 1.4 million in
need of urgent humanitarian aid.
It is estimated that Hurricane Matthew re-
sulted in damage that will cost Haiti
$1,000,000,000, or about 11.4 percent of its
gross domestic product. This includes exten-
sive damage to Haiti’s roadways, bridges,
buildings, and other critical infrastructure. Ad-
ditionally, Hurricane Matthew resulted in tre-
mendous destruction in Haiti’s agricultural sec-
tor with crop losses estimated to be $360 mil-
lion.
Madam Speaker, as we all know, Haiti con-
tinues its efforts to rebuild from the 2010, 7.0
magnitude earthquake, and recover from the
Cholera outbreak of the same year. With
these tragedies in mind, and the knowledge
that Haitians continue to work diligently to ad-
dress these and other important issues, in-
cluding creating strong democratic institutions,
I encourage all Members to join me in letting
the Haitian Diaspora know that we stand with
them.

RELIGIOUS FREEDOM DAY 2019
HON. J. FRENCH HILL
OF ARKANSAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 17, 2019
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I
would like to include in the RECORD the fol-
lowing Presidential Proclamation on Religious
Freedom Day 2019.
OFFICE OF THE PRESS SECRETARY
[For Immediate Release—January 15, 2019]
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM DAY, 2019
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA
A PROCLAMATION
On Religious Freedom Day, we celebrate
our Nation’s long-standing commitment to
freedom of conscience and the freedom to
profess one’s own faith. The right to reli-
gious freedom is innate to the dignity of
every human person and is foundational to
the pursuit of truth.
The Pilgrims who landed at Plymouth
shared an experience common to many of
America’s first settlers: they had fled their
home countries to escape religious persecu-
tion. Aware of this history, our Nation’s
Founding Fathers readily understood that a
just government must respect the deep
yearning for truth and openness to the tran-
scendent that are part of the human spirit.
For this reason, from the beginning, our con-
stitutional republic has endeavored to pro-
tect a robust understanding of religious free-
dom. On January 16, 1786, Virginia enacted
the Statute for Religious Freedom to protect
the right of individual conscience and reli-
gious exercise and to prohibit the compul-
sory support of any church. Authored by
Thomas Jefferson, the statute set forth the
principle that religious liberty is an inherent
right and not a gift of the state. Jefferson’s
statute served as the inspiration and model
for the legal architecture of the conscience

protections in the First Amendment, drafted
by James Madison just a few years later.
Unfortunately, the fundamental human
right to religious freedom is under attack.
Efforts to circumscribe religious freedom—or
to separate it from adjoining civil liberties,
like property rights or free speech—are on
the rise. Over time, legislative and political
attacks on religious freedom have given way
to actual violence. Last October, we wit-
nessed a horrific attack on the Tree of Life
Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania—the
deadliest attack on the Jewish community
in our Nation’s history. Tragically, attacks
on people of faith and their houses of wor-
ship have increased in frequency in recent
years.
My Administration is taking action to pro-
tect religious liberty and to seek justice
against those who seek to abridge it. The De-
partment of Justice is aggressively pros-
ecuting those who use violence or threats to
interfere with the religious freedom of their
fellow Americans. In January of 2018, the
Justice Department announced a religious
liberty update to the Justice Manual, raising
the profile of religious liberty cases. Also in
January of 2018, the Department of Health
and Human Services undertook major policy
changes to protect religious freedom, includ-
ing forming a new Conscience and Religious
Freedom Division within the Department’s
Office for Civil Rights and proposing a com-
prehensive new conscience protection regula-
tion to reinvigorate enforcement of religious
freedom laws within existing health care
programs.
Around the globe today, people are being
persecuted for their faith by authoritarian
dictatorships, terrorist groups, and other in-
tolerant individuals. To address this tragic
reality, last July, at my request, the Sec-
retary of State convened the first-ever Min-
isterial to Advance Religious Freedom. We
are listening to the voices of those risking
their lives for their religious beliefs, and we
are listening to the families of people who
have died fighting for their fundamental
right of conscience.
Our Nation was founded on the premise
that a just government abides by the ‘‘Laws
of Nature and of Nature’s God.’’ As the
Founders recognized, the Constitution pro-
tects religious freedom to secure the rights
endowed to man by his very nature. On this
day, we recognize this history and affirm our
commitment to the preservation of religious
freedom.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.
TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in
me by the Constitution and the laws of the
United States, do hereby proclaim January
16, 2019, as Religious Freedom Day. I call on
all Americans to commemorate this day
with events and activities that remind us of
our shared heritage of religious liberty and
that teach us how to secure this blessing
both at home and around the world.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto
set my hand this fifteenth day of January, in
the year of our Lord two thousand nineteen,
and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and forty-third.

TRIBUTE TO LYNDA DELAFORGUE
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 17, 2019
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life of an outstanding pro-
gressive warrior: Lynda DeLaForgue. Co-di-
rector of Citizen Action/Illinois, the largest pro-
gressive public interest organization in the
state, Lynda has left an indelible mark on laws
and policies that directly impact our families
and institutions. A skillful, smart and strategic
leader, she has had an outsized impact—one
that has made untold thousands of people’s
lives better. While her death last weekend is
a tremendous loss for all of us who worked
with her, admired her and loved her, her leg-
acy will remain strong for decades to come.
Lynda liked to quote Eleanor Roosevelt, and
one of her favorite quotes was this one: ‘‘A
woman is like a tea bag; you never know how
strong it is until it’s in hot water.’’ Lynda took
those words to heart. In fighting against pay-
day loans or for affordable health care, Lynda
was ‘‘Eleanor Roosevelt’’. She was the epit-
ome of ‘‘persistence’’—fighting for financial
protections, green energy solutions, or democ-
racy reforms. Whether you served in local,
state or federal government, when Lynda
reached out you knew she would have facts,
solutions and people behind her. And you
knew that she would not give up until she had
succeeded .
I first met Lynda when she worked for the
Illinois Public Action Council as a door-to-door
canvasser, office manager and voter registra-
tion organizer. She expanded her role to work
on consumer issues—health policy, financial
protections, marriage equality, and energy—al-
ways being sure to link policy to the real peo-
ple and to organizing. In 1997, she became
associate director—and three years later co-
director—of Citizen Action/Illinois. While there,
she and co-director William McNary made Cit-
izen Action/Illinois an innovative and effective
organization, recognized throughout Illinois
and the country.
Throughout her career, Lynda focused on
an underlying idea: that we can empower peo-
ple to demand and organize on their own be-
half to win a more just, fair and opportunity-
filled society. It is an idea easier to state than
to achieve, but Lynda knew the keys to suc-
cess: to have convictions, persistence, and to
work hard. She also knew the power of orga-
nizing and building coalitions. Lynda led by ex-
ample, and she always took time to mentor
and train her staff and provide solid counsel to
her allies and aspiring young organizers and
leaders. There is no one who combined all
these attributes more than Lynda.
Even as she struggled with colon cancer,
Lynda kept her eyes on the task at hand. She
was actively engaged in leading the progres-
sive political coalition that she built. She used
her own experiences with the health care sys-
tem to promote reform and access. She was
on the phone with my office talking about the
possibilities before us in the 116th Congress
even as she was getting her chemo-therapy
treatments.
Lynda brought the same joy and passion to
her private life as to her justice work. Every-
one enjoyed being with Lynda. She was inter-
ested in others and interesting to be around.
She was excited to travel, whether exploring
her French roots or discovering new avant-
garde artists. Above all, she was devoted to
her family: her sister Laura, her children Katy
and Jordan, and her life partner Brian
Reizfeld. To them, I extend my sincere sym-
pathy and my hope that they will take some
comfort in knowing how many people loved
and are inspired by Lynda.
As Eleanor Roosevelt told us, ‘‘One’s philos-
ophy is not best expressed in words; it is ex-
pressed in the choices one makes . . . and
the choices we make are ultimately our re-
sponsibility.’’ Lynda DeLaForgue chose to live
a life of conviction and action. I will miss her
very much.

RECOGNIZING THE MARTIN LU-
THER KING COMMEMORATIVE
COMMITTEE OF THE COACHELLA
VALLEY
HON. RAUL RUIZ
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 17, 2019
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the Martin Luther King Commemo-
rative Committee of the Coachella Valley for
their dedication to celebrating the life and leg-
acy of Dr. King.
Since 1986, the MLK Commemorative Com-
mittee has kept Dr. King’s commitment to civil
rights, nonviolence, and grassroots activism
alive. Every year, they have demonstrated to
our Desert community that the values Dr. King
preached—justice, love, respect—are as im-
portant today as they were during his lifetime.
This committee was born from the vision
and service of Mr. Joseph Beaver, a lifetime
civil rights advocate and community leader.
Answering the call to service during World
War II, Mr. Beaver was one of the first African
Americans to join the Marine Corps.
We are blessed by Mr. Beaver’s advocacy
for social justice, which has inspired and en-
riched our valley. To this day, he remains on
the frontlines fighting for civil rights here in our
community. In 2014, it was my honor to
present Mr. Beaver with the Congressional
Gold Medal for his accomplishments as a
service member and civil rights leader.
While the manifestations of racism and prej-
udice may have changed, the injustice Dr.
King battled endures today. Racism endures.
Inequality endures. Dr. King prophesized that
the arc of history bends toward justice, but the
road there has never been smooth.
As we remember Dr. King, we cannot rel-
egate him to the history books. To keep his
legacy alive, we must stand up to hatred,
white supremacy, and the systematic racism
that continues to plague our nation. In doing
so, we embrace the values Dr. King lived: jus-
tice, equality, and the courage to do what is
right.
That is the mission of the Commemorative
Committee: not to simply remember Dr. King
once a year, but to inspire us to carry on his
spirit in our hearts and enact his vision of love
and equality. It’s a message of freedom that,
through their efforts, rings across the
Coachella Valley and every valley, hill, and
stream across our nation.
On behalf of the residents of California’s
thirty-sixth congressional district, I congratulate
the Martin Luther King Commemorative Com-
mittee of the Coachella Valley for their com-
mitment to celebrating the life of Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King. I thank them for their service to our
community.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E62 January 17, 2019
INTRODUCTION OF THE COM-
PREHENSIVE CARE FOR SENIORS
ACT OF 2019
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 17, 2019
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today
I am pleased to introduce the Comprehensive
Care for Seniors Act of 2019. This legislation
would direct CMS to promulgate the long over-
due Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the El-
derly (PACE) final rule by April 1, 2019.
PACE is a proven care model delivering
high-quality, comprehensive, integrated and
coordinated community-based care to both
Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries 55 years
of age or older, who meet the criteria for a
nursing home level of care, but wish to live at
home. Multiple studies show that people re-
ceiving care from PACE organizations live
longer, experience better health, have fewer
hospitalizations and spend more time living at
home than those receiving care through other
programs.
PACE is a comprehensive, capitated, fully
integrated, provider-based health plan. At
present, there are 124 PACE organizations
operating in 31 states, serving over 45,000 el-
ders and those living with disabilities every
day. PACE operates based on the funda-
mental principle that it is preferable in terms of
quality of life, quality of care, and costs to
public and private payers for PACE-eligible in-
dividuals to be served in the community when-
ever possible. Ninety-five percent live at home
in their communities.
The PACE organization assesses each indi-
vidual upon enrollment and develops a per-
sonalized care plan, implemented primarily by
PACE staff across all settings of care twenty-
four hours a day, seven days a week, 365
days a year. Most PACE participants, 90 per-
cent, are dually eligible for Medicare and Med-
icaid. The average participant is 76 years of
age, and lives with multiple chronic, complex
medical conditions, which often significantly
limit activities of daily living. Approximately half
live with dementia. Thus, PACE organizations
enroll an exclusively high-risk, high-cost popu-
lation, with 85 percent being at least 65 years
of age, and 15 percent between the ages of
55 and 64.
When individuals with chronic and medically
complex conditions do not have access to
care, their quality of life is diminished, which
over time leads to increased expenditures.
PACE deliberately was constructed to address
the chronic care needs of individuals by pro-
viding timely and clinically appropriate treat-
ments and social supports.
Currently, PACE programs operate under
outdated regulations from 2006. It is critically
important that CMS issue the PACE final rule,
which will bring much needed regulatory flexi-
bility, allowing PACE organizations to innovate
and grow to best serve their participants, their
families, and their communities. I urge all of
my colleagues to join me to pass the Com-
prehensive Care for Seniors Act of 2019.
TRANS-SAHARA COUNTERTER-
RORISM PARTNERSHIP ACT
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 17, 2019
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, since 2005,
the United States has been actively involved
in the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partner-
ship, which is an interagency program to as-
sist partner countries in the Sahel and
Maghreb regions of Africa, including Niger, Ni-
geria, Tunisia, and Mali, to address terrorist
threats and prevent the spread of violent ex-
tremism.
This legislation is needed due to the contin-
ued high rate of terrorist activity on the con-
tinent, and this Partnership helps coordinate
our diplomatic, defense, and development ef-
forts to counter those threats.
Recently, the Pentagon, under the Presi-
dent’s direction, has been re-evaluating our
troop presence in Africa, which means the
United States will need to rely more heavily on
strategic partnerships built up over years. This
bill would do that.
The bill directs the Departments of State
and Defense as well as USAID to develop a
comprehensive, interagency strategy for U.S.-
Africa counterterrorism cooperation. It also im-
proves monitoring and evaluation of the Part-
nership’s programs to help guide whether ef-
forts should be refocused on certain aspects
of building partnership capacity.
Success in mitigating terrorism and violent
extremism in Africa and elsewhere around the
globe is predicated on our ability to work
closely with our allies and combat violent ex-
tremism in a consistent and effective manner.
This piece of legislation allows us to do just
that.
I’d like to thank Ranking Member MCCAUL
for his important work on this issue and intro-
ducing this legislation with me. I urge my col-
leagues to support this package.

RECOGNIZING THE 2019 MARCH
FOR LIFE
HON. F. JAMES SENSENBRENNER, JR.
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 17, 2019
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Madam Speaker, I
proudly recognize the 46th annual March for
Life taking place on January 18, 2019. Thou-
sands of Americans from across our great
country have made the pilgrimage to Wash-
ington to stand up for the protection of unborn
children.
Ever since the Supreme Court’s reprehen-
sible ruling in Roe vs. Wade, the barbaric
practice of abortion on demand has been
rampant in our nation. Too often people erro-
neously conflate abortion with women’s health
care, presenting a false choice of caring for
women or protecting life. It is possible to do
both.
I stand firmly with the millions of Americans
who believe that we must protect the lives of
innocent children. I have long been a staunch
advocate for pro-life issues. During my tenure
as Chairman of the House Judiciary Com-
mittee, I shepherded the ban on partial-birth
abortion through Congress. It was one of my
greatest honors to watch President George W.
Bush sign it into law. I have fully supported
every effort in Congress to prevent taxpayer
dollars from funding abortions—both in the
United States and abroad—and will continue
to fight efforts to reverse this practice. I am in-
spired by all who have traveled to Washington
to participate in the March for Life, especially
those from Wisconsin, and am grateful for all
who believe that every life is precious and
must be protected.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF ‘‘JUMPIN’ JOHNNY’’ WILSON
OF ANDERSON, INDIANA
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 17, 2019
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor the life and legacy of
John Edward Wilson, an Anderson legend.
‘‘Jumpin’ Johnny’’ Wilson was known for his
exceptional drive, hard work, and mentorship
displayed both on and off the basketball court.
The people of Indiana’s Fifth Congressional
District are forever grateful for Wilson’s revolu-
tionary contributions to the city of Anderson,
Madison County community, State of Indiana,
and our nation.
A life-long Hoosier, Wilson was born in 1927
and raised in Anderson, Indiana, where he at-
tended Anderson High School. During high
school, he used his athletic ability to shatter
racial barriers. Wilson led the Anderson Indi-
ans to their third state title, scoring 30 points
in the 1946 championship game, then a state
finals record. Wilson’s love of sports extended
far beyond basketball. He was an all-around
athlete and enjoyed playing football, track, and
baseball. His tremendous athletic ability led
him to be named the state’s first African-Amer-
ican Mr. Basketball and earned him the nick-
name Jumpin’ Johnny. True to his moniker,
Wilson won the state championship in the high
jump.
Upon graduating high school, Wilson as-
pired to play college basketball. During this
time, racial integration was discouraged. Due
to public sentiment, Wilson was not afforded
the opportunity to play for his dream school,
Indiana University. Wilson later passed up op-
portunities with other schools to play for An-
derson College, which was integrated in all as-
pects of student life. As an Anderson Raven,
Wilson earned 11 letters in four different
sports, was selected three times in basketball
as all-conference and team MVP, was a twice
named All-American, and finished third in the
nation in scoring in 1949. Anderson College
qualified for the National Association of Inter-
collegiate Athletics (NAIA) small-college tour-
nament during Wilson’s sophomore and junior
years, but the Ravens’ integrated team was
excluded. He still holds Anderson University’s
(AU) records for career scoring average
(23.3), season scoring average (25.4), field
goal attempts in a game (56), and ranks
eighth on the career scoring list with 1,540
points. Wilson was also named All-Conference
and team MVP in both baseball and track.
Wilson eventually left Anderson University,
attending various baseball tryout camps before
earning a spot on the Chicago American Gi-
ants in the Negro Leagues in 1949. Wilson’s

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E63

baseball career lasted only one season before
he switched sports, becoming a member of
the famed Harlem Globetrotters.
A true patriot, Wilson left the Globetrotters
to serve in the United States Army, later re-
turning to the team until retiring in 1954.
After retiring from the Harlem Globetrotters,
Wilson returned to college where he obtained
a teaching degree. He accepted a coaching
position at Indianapolis Wood High School
where he was named the first African-Amer-
ican coach at an integrated school in Indiana.
In his eight seasons as coach, Wood teams
won an astounding 139 games and lost 59.
After leaving Indianapolis, Wilson was hired
as athletic director and later head basketball
coach at Crane Community College in Chi-
cago. The junior college was soon renamed in
honor of civil rights figure Malcolm X. Wilson
was head coach of Malcolm X basketball for
16 years where his teams won 378 games
and lost 135, a .737 record. After retiring in
1989 from Malcolm X, he returned to his
hometown of Anderson, where he became as-
sistant coach for Anderson University with
good friend, and then head basketball coach
and athletic director, Barrett Bates.
Wilson was known as a great ambassador
to the community as assistant coach at AU.
Wilson was dedicated to his players’ success
and taught them the importance of working
hard, often claiming there is no such thing as
a ‘‘free lunch.’’ Encouraging players to go to
class and get an education was instilled in his
coaching philosophy. It was important to him
that players were successful both on and off
the court. Wilson was respected by other
coaches and the people he worked with. He
spent four seasons as an AU assistant coach
and three years as a volunteer assistant
coach at Anderson High School under Ron
Hecklinski. After being passed over for a head
coach position at Anderson High School more
than once, Wilson become head coach for the
girls’ basketball team. In 2002, he served as
an assistant coach to his son, John E. Wilson
Jr. at Lock Haven State College in Pennsyl-
vania.
Wilson was recognized consistently over the
years for his excellence in athletics. His con-
tributions were so significant, Anderson High
School erected a statue in his honor in 2016.
He was inducted into the Indiana Basketball
Hall of Fame in 1994, the Anderson University
Athletic Hall of Fame in 1997, and was named
Madison County’s 100 Greatest Athletes in
2012. Wilson was also honored as one of the
Top 50 Athletes of the Century in Indiana and
Co-Athlete of the Century by the Herald Bul-
letin with fellow teammate and AU Hall of
Famer Carl Erskine. He won the Humanitarian
Award from Malcolm X College and the Black
Sports Pioneer Award from Alpha Kappa So-
rority. Wilson was the recipient of the Distin-
guished Service and Citizen Awards from the
Boy Scouts of America, the Masons, Black
Expo, the City of Anderson and was chosen
as a Goodwill Ambassador by the Harlem
Globetrotters. Notably, Wilson enjoyed meet-
ing young men and women at the Herald Bul-
letin’s Johnny Wilson Awards annual lunch-
eon, where local multi-sport-student-athletes
were honored.
Wilson will be forever missed by his family,
friends, colleagues, and the entire Anderson
community. On behalf of Indiana’s Fifth Con-
gressional District, I extend my deepest con-
dolences to Wilson’s son, John E. (Jackie)
Wilson Jr., daughters, Sherri Wilson and Gena
Wilson-Stockard, brother, Gene (Mae Helen)
Wilson, and his many grandchildren, great
grandchildren, extended family and friends
who mourn his loss. The Anderson and Hoo-
sier community will forever miss his positive
attitude, mentorship, and unwillingness to quit.

INTRODUCTION OF THE HAITIAN
EDUCATIONAL EMPOWERMENT
ACT OF 2019
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 17, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in support of my bill, the Haitian Edu-
cational Empowerment Act of 2019.
Thought the current occupant of the White
House may want to have us believe that all is
well in Haiti while, parenthetically, speaking of
the country in derogatory and disgusting
terms, those of us who truly know this country,
those of us who truly care about the country
and the Haitian Diaspora, know that Haiti re-
mains on the road to recovery. The rebuilding
continues from not only Hurricane Matthew,
but the 2010 earthquake and the cholera out-
break, all of which continue to provide road-
blocks to Haiti’s full recovery. It is imperative
that we do all that we can to ensure that the
Haitian people receive the assistance they
need to realize a vibrant, strong, and healthy
democracy.
To that end, the Haitian Educational Em-
powerment Act of 2019 authorizes the Sec-
retary of State to establish a scholarship pro-
gram for Haitian students who have had their
studies disrupted by the 2010 earthquake or
Hurricane Matthew. Such scholarships will en-
sure that Haiti has access to the future teach-
ers, doctors, lawyers and civil servants it will
need to realize its full potential with strong
democratic institutions and a strong economy.
Madam Speaker, I invite all of my col-
leagues to join me in support of this important
bill—a bill that will help Haitians help Haiti as
the country continues its hard work on its road
to recovery.

HONORING THE HARRISBURG PO-

TION OF TOWN WATCH ‘‘ROOKIE
OF THE YEAR’’ AWARD
HON. SCOTT PERRY
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 17, 2019
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor and congratulate the outstanding men
and women of the Harrisburg Police Depart-
ment on earning the National Association of
Town Watch ‘‘Rookie of the Year’’ Award.
On August 7, 2018, 16,780 law enforcement
agencies across the Country held local Na-
tional Night Out events, aimed at promoting
police-community partnerships through neigh-
borhood block parties and cookouts with offi-
cers. Out of nearly 800 nationwide law en-
forcement groups who held a National Night
Out for the first time, the Harrisburg Police De-
partment was one of only three agencies in
Pennsylvania selected for recognition.
Law enforcement officers are heroes, and
we must not take their service for granted.
They put their lives on the line to keep our
neighborhoods, homes, businesses and
schools safe and secure. The National Night
Out in August was just one more example of
the Harrisburg Police Department’s cherished
charge to protect and defend the people they
serve.
I’ve long appreciated the commitment and
self-sacrifice of our law enforcement profes-
sionals. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s Tenth
Congressional District, I commend, congratu-

OATH CEREMONY ON JANUARY 25,
2019
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 17, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with
great pleasure and sincerity that I take this
time to congratulate thirty individuals who will
take their oaths of citizenship on January 25,
2019. This memorable occasion will be held at
the United States Courthouse and Federal
Building in Hammond, Indiana.
America is a country founded by immi-
grants. From its beginning, settlers have come
from countries around the world to the United
States in search of better lives for their fami-
lies. Oath ceremonies are a shining example
of what is so great about the United States of
America—that people from all over the world
can come together and unite as members of
a free, democratic nation. These individuals
realize that nowhere else in the world offers a
better opportunity for success than here in
America.
On January 25, 2019, the following people,
representing many nations throughout the
world, will take their oaths of citizenship in
Hammond, Indiana: Julia Sui Nei Mawi, Balida
McCraw, Song E. Paik, Bruno Frederic
Penteado, Angel Chiang, Maricela Garcilazo,
Luis Antonio Huerta, Carmen Navarro Lopez,
Tatiana Madon, Jorge Martinez, Lucia
Tiscornia, Karina Furlic, Viktoriya Trenkinshu,
Ana M. Anguiano, Jose Arturo Jimenez, Nishi
Wairimu Muna, Elyahu Harold Herszberg,
Tianlin Wang Ford, Tsoelopele Quincy
Mukwena, Haneen Abuhasan, Sofia Rebeca
Cavazos; Belen Candelario, Ljubica Trajceski,
Shing Vucich Chung, Jabrieh Mustafa Issa,
Dijana Najdeski, Suthon Somjana, Elena
Eshanova, Martin Paul Nowosadzki, and
Selenne Serna.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E64 January 17, 2019
Although each individual has sought to be-
come a citizen of the United States for his or
her own reasons, be it for education, occupa-
tion, or to offer their loved ones better lives,
each is inspired by the fact that the United
States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln de-
scribed it, a country ‘‘. . . of the people, by
the people, and for the people.’’ They realize
that the United States is truly a free nation. By
seeking American citizenship, they have made
the decision that they want to live in a place
where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment
of the Constitution, they can practice religion
as they choose, speak their minds without fear
of punishment, and assemble in peaceful pro-
test should they choose to do so.
Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask you and
my other distinguished colleagues to join me
in congratulating these individuals who will be-
come citizens of the United States of America
on January 25, 2019. They, too, are American
citizens, guaranteed the inalienable rights to
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We,
as a free and democratic nation, congratulate
them and welcome them.

RECOGNIZING MR. EDDIE FARRIS
AS THE 2018–2019 WALTON COUN-
TY, FLORIDA EDUCATIONAL SUP-
PORT PROFESSIONAL OF THE
YEAR
HON. MATT GAETZ
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 17, 2019
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Mr. Eddie Farris as the 2018–2019
Walton County Educational Support Profes-
sional of the Year. For seven years, Mr. Farris
has served the Walton County School District
with exceptional passion and an unwavering
commitment to service.
It is recognized that the position of Plant
Manager comes with numerous responsibil-
ities, but Mr. Farris continues to dependably
perform his many duties while exceeding at
his profession. Remarkably, Mr. Farris does all
this while consistently offering a warm smile to
everyone who enjoys the pleasure of working
with him.
Mr. Farris is cherished by his supervisors
and colleagues for his incredible kindness and
positive attitude. He generously considers the
needs of both students and staff because of
the immense pride he possesses for his
school.
His support knows no bounds, as evidenced
by his willingness to provide assistance wher-
ever and whenever it is needed. Mr. Farris
has displayed dedicated teamwork by working
with the PTO in coordinating events, such as
Fall Festivals and movie nights. He is to be
commended for his steadfast desire to serve
as a positive example for those who matter
most—the students.
I am truly proud to have Mr. Farris as a con-
stituent in Florida’s First Congressional District
and offer my gratitude for his admirable con-
tributions to his community.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United
States Congress, I am privileged to recognize
Mr. Eddie Farris for his accomplishments, as
well as his commitment to excellence, profes-
sionalism, innovation, service, and collabora-
tion in the Walton County School District. I
thank him for his good work, and wish him
continued success in the future.

REJECTING WHITE NATIONALISM
AND WHITE SUPREMACY
SPEECH OF
HON. ZOE LOFGREN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 15, 2019
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise in
support of H. Res. 41 to reject White nation-
alism and White supremacy. I applaud Mr.
CLYBURN and the House for acting against
hate speech. Representative KING has rightly
been stripped of committee assignments by
his colleagues, but today’s vote has been a
long time coming. His latest comments were
not the first time Representative KING has
made ugly, offensive, demeaning, and un-
ashamedly racist remarks. Unfortunately, for
more than a decade now, House Republican
leadership did nothing while Representative
KING freely espoused white nationalism, anti-
Semitism, and bigotry. Today, under Demo-
cratic Leadership, the House is taking appro-
priate action against a member of the House
who has time and again promoted hate
speech in Congress and Republicans have fi-
nally acted to impose discipline for miscount.
I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 41 to
reject Representative KING’s racism, bigotry,
and hate.
f
RECOGNIZING MR. TIMOTHY W.
COY
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR.
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 17, 2019
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize Timothy W. Coy for over four dec-
ades of extraordinary public service. Mr. Coy
will retire this month from the Office of the
Under Secretary of Defense as a Team Chief
after nearly a decade of providing accurate,
rapid, and actionable guidance on a broad
range of issues including legislative proposals
and appeals, congressional hearing support,
and statements of administration policy.
Preceding his role with the Office of the
Under Secretary of Defense, Mr. Coy served
his country in the United States Air Force
(USAF) . He received assignments as a mem-
ber of the USAF ‘‘Thunderbirds’’ and the initial
cadre of the F–117 ‘‘Stealth’’ fighter program.
Mr. Coy worked through the ranks to receive
the title of Crew Commander, where he be-
came the Aide-de-Camp and Executive Officer
for the Commander, 4th Air Division. More re-
cently, Mr. Coy was selected to be one of nine
Air Force Legislative Fellows and, in this ca-
pacity, specialized in defense policy for Sen-
ator Wayne Allard. After graduating the pro-
gram, Mr. Coy worked for the United States
Joint Forces Command (JFCOM), where he
advocated for JFCOM programs on Capitol
Hill as the Chief of Legislative Affairs. After a
successful 27 years in the military, Mr. Coy re-
tired from the USAF in 2004 to become the
Deputy Director and, later, Director of Legisla-
tive Affairs for the Missile Defense Agency.
During his service with the Agency, Mr. Coy
advocated for a $9 billion budget in Congress
to help develop new missile defense systems
that protect the United States and its allies
from hostile ballistic missile attacks.
Mr. Coy has received numerous accolades
throughout his distinguished career. In addition
to earning the title of ‘‘Top Performer’’ in his
Minuteman III training in Officer Training
School, Mr. Coy has been selected as one of
Strategic Air Command’s top missileers for as-
signment to the TOP HAND Program. Mr. Coy
also attended Harvard University as a Senior
Executive Fellow, where he earned a Certifi-
cate in Public Policy.
All who knew and worked with Mr. Coy will
miss his leadership and strong work ethic. I
am sad to see him leave, but even more
proud to congratulate him on a well-earned re-
tirement as he starts a new chapter in his life.

ROE V. WADE 46TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 17, 2019
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today as constituents of the First District
of Georgia, and from across the nation, come
to D.C. to be a voice for those who cannot
stand up for themselves.
This year marks the 46th anniversary of the
misguided U.S. Supreme Court decision, Roe
v. Wade.
It is a tragedy that since this ruling in 1973,
millions of defenseless babies have been de-
nied the right to life.
As a health care professional, father, and
grandfather, I strongly believe that life begins
at conception, and I support the sanctity of
human life.
This past Congress, I worked tirelessly
alongside fellow Members and pro-life advo-
cates in our fight to end abortion.
We accomplished a lot.
Most notably, passing and signing into law
H.J. Res. 43, which overturned the Obama ad-
ministration’s rule preventing states from re-
directing Title X funds away from abortion pro-
viders like Planned Parenthood.
Now, states have the freedom to distribute
Title X grant money in a way that best serves
the needs of their constituents.
Additionally, the House approved multiple
pro-life bills including the No Taxpayer Fund-
ing for Abortion Act, the Pain Capable Unborn
Child Protection Act, and the Born-Alive Abor-
tion Survivors Protection Act.
Each one of these bills represents a step
forward in our fight to save the life of a child.
Rest assured, we are committed to con-
tinuing our fight for the precious lives of the in-
nocent unborn in the 116th Congress.
I want to thank each and every person who
have traveled to our Nation’s Capital today for
this important occasion.
I look forward to meeting with my constitu-
ents and other Georgia residents to discuss
pro-life values and initiatives for the upcoming
year.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E65
January 17, 2019
RECOGNIZING THE 46TH
ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V. WADE
HON. RON ESTES
OF KANSAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 17, 2019
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
address the first and most fundamental right
guaranteed to every individual . . . the right to
life.
Next week marks the 46th anniversary since
the tragic ruling in Roe v. Wade. In that time,
more than 60 million lives have been lost to
abortion.
That’s 60 million babies who were never
given the chance to fulfill their potential as a
future doctor, farmer, artist, or Member of
Congress.
Last year the House made significant
progress to protect life through the Pain-Capa-
ble Unborn Child Protection Act and by urging
the Trump administration to update Title X
guidelines so that tax dollars for family plan-
ning services don’t go to abortion providers.
I was proud to help lead that effort in the
House, but I know we can’t stop there.
That’s why I want to thank the hundreds of
thousands of Americans from Kansas and
throughout our country who are arriving in
Washington this week to participate in the
March for Life.
As part of this year’s theme, Unique from
Day One: Pro-Life is Pro-Science, we know
that research has proven what pro-life Kan-
sans have already known—that life is precious
and it begins at conception.
As a proud father of three and a Kansan, I
stand in support of the hundreds of thousands
of fellow Kansans and Americans who will be
the voice for the voiceless at the March for
Life.
I want to thank Congressman SMITH for or-
ganizing the Special Order.
