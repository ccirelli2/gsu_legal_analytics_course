PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Eternal God who transforms common
days into transfiguring and redemptive
moments, continue to guide our law-
makers with Your might.
Lord, make our Senators brave
enough for these momentous times as
they seek to live worthy of Your great
Name. May they not trust in their wis-
dom or power but rely on You to keep
them secure. Guide them around life’s
pitfalls. Bring them through the dark-
ness to a haven.
Lord, cleanse the fountains of their
hearts from that which defiles so that
they may be fit vessels to be used for
Your glory. Let Your peace be within
them as Your Spirit inspires them to
glorify Your Holy Name.
Amen.
f
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The President pro tempore led the
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
HAWLEY). The Senator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to address the Sen-
ate for 1 minute as in morning busi-
ness.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
f
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA
TRADE AGREEMENT
Mr. GRASSLEY. I have come to the
floor many times to speak with my col-
leagues about the U.S.-Mexico-Canada
trade agreement. I recently spoke with
my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives and also officials within
the administration about the same sub-
ject. By all accounts, the deal is close
on the United States-Mexico-Canada
trade agreement.
I urge House Democrats to act quick-
ly and be reasonable so we can finally
deliver certainty on this issue to the
American people. It has now been more
than a year since the leaders of Can-
ada, Mexico, and the United States
signed the agreement, so Americans
have waited a year for what can happen
now. This modernized trade agreement
will create hundreds of thousands of
new jobs and help Americans grow
wages for our workers.
The end of this year’s legislative ses-
sion is rapidly approaching, as we all
know. If a deal cannot be reached by
the end of this week, I do not see how
the USMCA can be ratified in the year
we are in. As it is, the window of oppor-
tunity for 2019 is extremely tight. Now
is the time for the Democratic-con-
trolled House of Representatives to fi-
nally act so we can act in the Senate.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.

RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under
the previous order, the leadership time
is reserved.

CONCLUSION OF MORNING
BUSINESS
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning
business is closed.

EXECUTIVE SESSION
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session and resume
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report.
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Dan R. Brouillette, of Texas,
to be Secretary of Energy.
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I had a
wonderful Thanksgiving break, and I
trust the Presiding Officer did, too. I
hope all enjoyed time with their fami-
lies and friends last week.
It was my pleasure to be back home
in Texas and spend time with some in-
credible people who and some organiza-
tions that are doing a lot of good in
their communities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6782 December 2, 2019
For example, I volunteered at the
Central Texas Food Bank, which has a
service area that is twice the size of
Massachusetts. It has been fighting
hunger for nearly four decades. I joined
those there to help distribute to low-
income families some of the food they
had collected as they prepared for
Thanksgiving, and I had the chance to
speak with dozens of constituents there
in the Austin area.
Then I got in my car and went south
about 70 miles to San Antonio, which is
my hometown, where I volunteered
with the preparations for the 40th an-
nual Raul Jimenez Thanksgiving Din-
ner. As I said, this dinner has been
going on for 40 years, and it serves
25,000 people each year in the San An-
tonio area who might otherwise go
hungry. The numbers are immense. I
spent a little bit of time as a volunteer
with a number of folks and picked the
turkeys apart and broke them up into
small, bite-sized pieces. They told me
that they served 9,400 pounds of turkey
during this 40th anniversary dinner. It
is really one of my favorite events each
year, and it was made even more spe-
cial since they dedicated this year’s
dinner to Mary, Raul’s wife, who,
sadly, passed away earlier this year.
Then I traveled up to Wichita Falls,
where I was able to spend a little bit of
time at Sheppard Air Force Base with
the families of deployed airmen. I
think it is very important that we re-
member, particularly during the holi-
days, that having a loved one in the
military service who is deployed and
separated from the rest of the family
involves a lot of sacrifice, not only on
the part of the servicemember but on
the ones who are left behind, as that
hole in your heart feels a little bit big-
ger during the holidays.
My dad served 31 years in the U.S.
Air Force. Fortunately, by the time I
came along, his long-term deployments
had long been over. Still, every time I
meet a young family whose loved one is
deployed overseas while the family
waits behind, it tugs at my
heartstrings. So we thank not only
those who wear the uniform of the U.S.
military but those family members as
well, who, I believe, also serve.
We have an all-volunteer military.
No one makes you join the military
anymore in America. We should thank
all of them for their service in different
ways.
It was encouraging to me to meet
with these patriots and thank them for
their sacrifices and help to distribute a
little bit of Thanksgiving love and food
ahead of the holiday.
I came back here to Washington re-
freshed, having spent that time with
constituents and family and friends,
and I am eager to get back to work.
We know that the countdown to
Christmas is on, and we have a long to-
do list before we are through. One of
our top priorities, strange as it may
sound, is to actually pass appropria-
tions bills to fund the government for
the remainder of the fiscal year. I be-
lieve that the single most important
function of the Federal Government—
something that none of us can do indi-
vidually nor the States collectively—is
to provide for the common defense. The
way we do that is by funding our mili-
tary and making sure that they have
the training, the leadership, and the
materials they need in order to fight
and win our Nation’s wars or, ideally,
to not have to fight our Nation’s wars
because nobody will dare mess with the
U.S. military.
That is why it is particularly sad to
see that we find ourselves balled up in
this appropriations process this late in
the year. Over the summer we came to
a bipartisan, bicameral agreement to
guide the appropriations process and,
hopefully, to eliminate this uncer-
tainty going into the Christmas sea-
son. Last August we had an agreement
that provided a roadmap for negotia-
tions this fall, and we all promised to
work together in good faith and to stay
away from poison pill policy riders and
other things that might derail this ap-
propriations process.
Well, obviously things did not work
the way we had planned. Unfortu-
nately, our Democratic colleagues
went back on their promise because of
a disagreement over 0.3 percent of the
federal budget. You heard that cor-
rectly—0.3 percent. A disagreement
over domestic spending involving 0.3
percent of the Federal budget derailed
all of the appropriations process and
leaves us in our current state of dys-
function.
So rather than passing appropria-
tions bills on time, as we were on track
to do, we passed two short-term fund-
ing bills, and we are working day and
night to avoid needing another one
when the current continuing resolution
expires on December 20. I know Chair-
man SHELBY and our colleagues and the
staff on the appropriations committees
have been trying to build consensus on
these funding bills, and I can only hope
and pray that we can reach an agree-
ment soon.
There are a lot of other things that
we can and should be doing. We started
this year off with a government shut-
down, and we can’t afford to make that
an annual affair, but this roller coaster
ride involving short-term spending
bills puts us in a bad position, particu-
larly for our military and other areas
of government that need certainty and
need to be able to make plans.
As our troops are serving around the
globe to keep us safe, as well as our
friends and allies abroad, we need to do
everything in our power here at home
to give them the stability they need to
succeed. Our commanders and military
leaders have repeatedly told us how dif-
ficult it is to plan for the future with-
out a predictable budget, and the con-
stantly evolving threat landscape only
underscores that need. We need to get
that done.
In addition to funding the military,
we need to finish up the National De-
fense Authorization Act and get it to
the President’s desk. Every year since
1961, Congress has passed the National
Defense Authorization Act without
delay, and now is not the time to get
bogged down in partisan fights in Con-
gress and fail to do what we have done
each year since 1961.
Unfortunately, our Democratic col-
leagues in the House are trying to use
this must-pass piece of legislation to
leverage some of their liberal wish list.
The version of this legislation passed
by the House earlier this year is so par-
tisan that it didn’t get a single Repub-
lican vote—not one. Putting our na-
tional security on the line in order to
pander to radical factions in the oppos-
ing party is absolutely shameful. There
are some things that should rise above
politics, rise above partisanship, and
providing for our military is first on
that list.
I appreciate our colleagues on the
Armed Services Committee, led by
Chairman INHOFE, who have been fight-
ing to get these poison pills out of this
legislation so we can pass the National
Defense Authorization Act without any
additional delay. It is critical that we
get these bills moving before everyone
heads home for the holidays.
There is one other piece of legisla-
tion I hope we can deliver before we
leave. Over the last few weeks, I have
been hearing rumors—which I hope are
true—that a deal on the USMCA is
very close. The USMCA, of course, is
the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agree-
ment, which is the successor to
NAFTA, the North American Free
Trade Agreement.
NAFTA is reported to support, ac-
cording to the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce, about 13 million jobs in Amer-
ica—8 million with our binational
trade with Canada and 5 million with
Mexico. This comes after nearly a year
of negotiations between the adminis-
tration and Speaker PELOSI and her
House colleagues to resolve some dif-
ferences, and I am cautiously opti-
mistic that we may yet see an agree-
ment soon. We have been anxious to
get the final agreement so the House
can begin processing it and then send it
over here so we can begin reviewing it
in the Senate Finance Committee.
The experts have told us that this
agreement would lead to increased
wealth for the United States and more
than 176,000 new jobs. So it is time to
get it ratified, but with the House con-
tinuing its single-minded obsession to
impeach the President, I hope this
trade agreement doesn’t fall victim to
impeachment mania.
Whether I am meeting with farmers,
ranchers, manufacturers, small busi-
nesses or just average Texans, one of
the top questions I get at home is this:
When is the USMCA going to pass?
I heard last week that it is one of the
top Federal priorities for the Central
Texas Food Bank. I would like to be
able to head home for Christmas in a
few weeks with some great news for my
constituents back home.
With impeachment using up most of
the oxygen in Washington, I am afraid

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6783
December 2, 2019
our ability to get bipartisan work done
is getting smaller and smaller. If the
impeachment circus makes its way to
this side of the Capitol, that ability
may completely go away. If we stick to
the timeline of the Clinton impeach-
ment, that would mean the articles of
impeachment would be voted on in late
December, and then, literally, for the
first 5 or 6 weeks of 2020, the Senate
would be required to sit as the jury in
impeachment proceedings, during
which time nothing else can be done.
We need to check these critical items
off of Congress’s to-do list over the
next few weeks—the things that we can
and should get done before the Christ-
mas holidays, and I am eager to get to
work and to do my part.
Our hope is that our friends on the
other side of the aisle will join us in
the same commitment.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call
be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader is recognized.
CYBER SECURITY
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, allow
me to begin on a topic that doesn’t cur-
rently concern legislation or nominees
on the floor but one that does concern
our national security and the privacy
of the American people.
Over the summer, I requested a re-
view of the potential risks posed by
FaceApp, a widely used Russian-based
mobile application that requires the
full and irrevocable access of its users’
photos and data. Very recently, the
FBI responded to my request in writ-
ing, warning that the FBI ‘‘considers
any mobile application or similar prod-
uct developed in Russia, such as
FaceApp, to be a potential counter-
intelligence threat, based on the data
the product collects, its privacy and
terms-of-use policies, and the legal
mechanisms available to the Govern-
ment of Russia that permit access to
data within Russia’s borders.’’
Let me repeat this. These are the
FBI’s words in a letter sent to me just
in the last few hours; that the FBI
‘‘considers,’’ their words, ‘‘any mobile
application or similar product devel-
oped in Russia, such as FaceApp, to be
a potential counterintelligence
threat.’’
The letter went on to say that the
FBI is prepared to address foreign in-
fluence operations involving FaceApp
against elected officials, candidates,
political campaigns, and political par-
ties.
In light of the FBI’s warning, I
strongly urge all Americans to con-
sider deleting apps like FaceApp imme-
diately and proceed with extreme cau-
tion when downloading apps from for-
eign countries that are known adver-
saries. The personal data that FaceApp
collects from a user’s device could end
up in the hands of Russian intelligence
services. It is simply not worth the
risk.
Americans should be aware of the
risks posed by certain mobile apps, par-
ticularly those developed in foreign
countries that are known adversaries,
before they download them. The FBI
didn’t name other countries, but I
would certainly name not only Russia
but China, Iran, and there are others.
Please, Americans, be careful, and let
us let all of our intelligence agencies
pursue this potential danger to Amer-
ica and ensure that it doesn’t endanger
our national security.
DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. President, on to the NDAA. The
issue of FaceApp is a microcosm of a
larger problem about cyber security
and our foreign adversaries. There is no
doubt that Russia and Vladimir Putin
continue to meddle in our democracy
and interfere in our elections. We
should be doing everything in our
power to stop it and prevent that from
happening, from hardening our election
infrastructure to ensuring that our
military has the cyber authority need-
ed to respond to attacks, to passing
tough new sanctions to deter any for-
eign power from interfering in our elec-
tions.
So it is incomprehensible to me that
at the moment, Leader MCCONNELL and
Senate Republicans are opposing the
election security measures we wish to
include in the annual Defense bill. It is
amazing. There is bipartisan support
for these, but Leader MCCONNELL is
once again saying that we are not
going to do all we can to prevent Rus-
sia from interfering in our elections.
That is right—the annual Defense bill,
which passed the Senate months ago,
remains in conference, in part, because
Leader MCCONNELL and Senate Repub-
licans refuse to include important elec-
tion security legislation. There is bi-
partisan legislation on this issue—the
DETER Act and DASKA—that would
trigger sanctions on any government
that tried to interfere with American
elections.
I don’t care what your party is—
Democratic, Republican, or any other,
no good American wants Russia or any
foreign power to be able to interfere in
our elections. It is one of the things
the Founding Fathers were most wor-
ried about. How can our Republican
leaders sit blithely by, as the danger is
real and as a bipartisan group is trying
to prevent Russia from interfering and
doing what we can to stop it. He is
holding up the NDAA bill, in part, be-
cause of this provision.
Why the Republican leader and the
Republican committee chairs are
blocking this legislation is beyond me.
Some have said the Trump administra-
tion is ready to act without these sanc-
tions, even though it has failed to im-
plement the sanctions targeted at Rus-
sia’s Putin that are already on the
books. Some have expressed concern
about the sanctions on our allies and
their partners while they know these
issues can be addressed. When those ar-
guments flail, they hide behind process
complaints. No objection they have
holds any water.
The NDAA, the Defense authoriza-
tion act, might be one of the last
chances to enact election security leg-
islation before the upcoming Presi-
dential election next year, including
Senator VAN HOLLEN’s proposal and
other targeted sanctions offered by
Senator MENENDEZ—both of which
enjoy bipartisan support—is para-
mount. Inexplicably, Leader MCCON-
NELL has yet again refused to allow
these kinds of measures to go forward,
refused to allow nearly any election se-
curity legislation from being consid-
ered in the Senate at all, and has re-
peatedly downplayed the threat of for-
eign interference in our elections.
Our country’s top national security
officials have warned repeatedly that
our adversaries—North Korea, Iran,
China, and, of course, Russia—are con-
sidering or working on new ways to
meddle in our elections and that we
have not done enough to prepare our-
selves. We need now—not later, now—
to take commonsense steps to protect
the vital wellspring of our democracy:
free and fair elections unimpeded by
outside interference.
I urge Leader MCCONNELL, I urge
Senate Republicans to stand down and
work with Democrats to secure our de-
mocracy. If there are Republican Sen-
ators who agree with us and don’t want
to say anything publicly, please go
over to Leader MCCONNELL privately
and urge him to stand down.
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY
Mr. President, on Wednesday, the
House Judiciary Committee will hold
its first hearing as a part of the im-
peachment inquiry, during which the
constitutional history of impeachment
will be examined and discussed with
legal scholars. It is another example of
how the House impeachment inquiry is
proceeding in a deliberate, studious,
and sober-minded manner, and it
stands in stark contrast to some of the
recent statements by Republicans on
this side of the Capitol.
While the House investigation con-
tinues in search of the facts, certain
Senate Republicans have made increas-
ingly outlandish claims, including the
assertion that Ukraine might have
been involved in interfering with the
2016 election.
Let me be clear. The charge that
Ukraine had something to do with elec-
tion meddling in 2016 is a lie spread by
Vladimir Putin to get things off his
back. Putin and Russian intelligence
services invented that lie to muddy the
waters and distract from the fact that
Russia, not Ukraine, interfered in our
elections.
Now, disgracefully, we have sitting
U.S. Senators helping spread that Rus-
sian propaganda in an effort to defend

the President. Republicans must stop
claiming that Ukraine had anything to
do with election interference in 2016.
Repeating these claims, even specu-
lating about them, is doing Putin’s job
for him. I urge my Republican col-
leagues—they know who they are—to
stop spreading these lies which hurts
our democracy.
APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. President, finally on appropria-
tions, while the Senate was away for
the Thanksgiving holiday, there was an
important bit of progress in the appro-
priations process. House and Senate ap-
propriators have agreed to the alloca-
tions to the various committees—
known as 302(b)s—and are now working
to finalize the 12 appropriations bills.
I applaud the appropriators on both
sides of the aisle and on both sides of
the Capitol for clearing this major hur-
dle and potentially paving the way to
finish appropriations by the end of this
year, 2019.
Now that we have an agreement on
allocations in place, Senate Democrats
want to ensure that the final appro-
priations bills include several of our
policies and priorities. These are what
we Senate Democrats want to make
sure are in these bills: significant re-
sources to combat the opioid and gun
violence epidemics; significant invest-
ment in infrastructure; significant in-
vestment in childcare; funding for the
Violence Against Women Act needs to
be maintained or, ideally, increased,
which is a Democratic priority; and
there must be—must be—funding to se-
cure our elections in advance of next
year’s Presidential election.
Of course, there is still the impedi-
ment of President Trump’s insistence
on funding an expensive and ineffective
border wall. Senate Democrats strong-
ly oppose the President’s stealing
money from our military families to
pay for this border wall. We have
fought for provisions to stop this theft,
and we will continue to do so. I hope
my Republican colleagues muster the
courage to stand with the military
families in their States whose funds
have been robbed to build this vanity
project of President Trump.
Again, I am very pleased we have an
agreement on 302(b)s. We must now
build on that momentum to make sure
the final appropriations bills help the
American people as much as possible.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms.
ERNST). The clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
NOMINATION OF DAN R. BROUILLETTE
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, here
is what the Senate and the American
people need to know before the next
vote coming up on the nominee to be
the Secretary of Energy.
First, Mr. Rick Perry—who until yes-
terday was the Energy Secretary—has
refused to comply with the subpoena to
testify about his involvement in the
Trump-Ukraine scheme.
Second, Acting Secretary Dan
Brouillette—nominated to replace Mr.
Perry—has failed to provide sub-
stantive answers to key questions
about Mr. Perry’s dealings with the
Ukrainian state-owned energy com-
pany Naftogaz.
Third, since I have been raising ques-
tions on this matter, Naftogaz execu-
tives have reportedly been coming for-
ward to cooperate in a Federal inves-
tigation into the Ukraine scheme.
Mr. Perry has virtually skipped
town, leaving his job after insisting for
months that he was determined to stay
while the Ukraine scheme is front and
center in the House impeachment in-
quiry.
Now, with the vote on Mr. Perry’s re-
placement just minutes away, the Sen-
ate is truly in the dark, lacking an-
swers to important questions. Those
questions include issues pertaining to
Mr. Perry’s role in a campaign to
change the leadership of Naftogaz;
questions about what Mr. Perry, his
donors, and certain crooked associates
of Rudy Giuliani’s stood to gain from
those changes; questions about Mr.
Perry’s role in the Ukraine scheme,
which Trump administration officials
have admitted was about withholding
critical military aid in a face-to-face
meeting until the Ukrainian President
agreed to do for Donald Trump what he
described as a political favor.
These are serious issues closely tied
to ongoing investigations. This goes
way, way beyond the well-documented
waste we often see in the Trump Cabi-
net—private jets, soundproof booths,
$30,000 desks; this is about the adminis-
tration using its full might to push a
foreign leader into helping Donald
Trump’s reelection campaign. The Sen-
ate ought to know about Rick Perry’s
involvement, especially since he was
described by Mr. Holmes and others as
one of the ‘‘three amigos’’ who were
right in the center of all this.
What exactly is the rush on con-
firming his replacement? This isn’t the
first week of a new administration.
Nothing is going to happen to the pow-
erplants or nuclear facilities if the
Senate takes the time to get answers
to these central questions. Dan
Brouillette is already the Acting Sec-
retary. No American interest suffers if
the Senate insists on getting answers
that go right to the heart of the Sen-
ate’s oversight responsibilities.
I briefly want to recall what this is
all about.
The ‘‘three amigos’’ basically seized
control of our country’s ties with
Ukraine under the direction of the
President and his personal lawyer,
Rudy Giuliani. Secretary Perry led the
American delegation that attended
President Zelensky’s inauguration in
May after the Vice President was told
to stay home. The Vice President and
President Zelensky held private meet-
ings.
It has been reported that Perry
pushed President Zelensky to fire
members of the board of Naftogaz and
replace them with Mr. Perry’s own po-
litical donors. At a subsequent meeting
with the Ukraine Government and en-
ergy sector officials, Perry reportedly
said that the entire board ought to be
replaced.
The Associated Press reported that
at that meeting—and I am going to
quote here—the Associated Press said
that one of those people who attended
that meeting where Perry was in at-
tendance ‘‘said he was floored by the
American requests because the person
had always viewed the U.S. govern-
ment ‘as having a higher ethical stand-
ard.’’’
The changes Mr. Perry was seeking
lined up with changes sought by a pair
of now-indicted men, Lev Parnas and
Igor Fruman, who were apparently
friends of Mr. Giuliani’s. They, too,
wanted different leadership at
Naftogaz. Here is what the Associated
Press had to say about that:
As Rudy Giuliani was pushing Ukraine of-
ficials last spring to investigate Donald
Trump’s main political rivals, a group of in-
dividuals with ties to the president and his
personal lawyer were also active in the
former Soviet republic. Their aims were
profit, not politics. This circle of business-
men and Republican donors touted connec-
tions to Mr. Giuliani and Trump while trying
to install new management at the top of
Ukraine’s massive state-owned gas company.
Their plan was to then steer lucrative con-
tracts to companies controlled by Trump al-
lies, according to two people with knowledge
of their plans.
Federal prosecutors are investigating
the role of Mr. Giuliani. At least one
Naftogaz official is reportedly cooper-
ating in the investigation.
Some of Mr. Perry’s political donors
did score a lucrative energy deal in
Ukraine after Perry got involved there.
Perry admits he was in contact with
Giuliani about Ukraine.
It was also revealed in impeachment
testimony that Perry was seemingly
made aware in July of the Trump
scheme and Ukraine.
Unlike Fiona Hill, unlike David
Holmes, unlike Lieutenant Colonel
Vindman, Rick Perry has refused to
testify and share what he knows with
the public.
For nearly 3 weeks, I have been try-
ing to get answers. At Mr. Brouillette’s
nomination hearing on November 14, I
asked him really basic questions. I had
plenty of time—to a great extent, cour-
tesy of my good friend the ranking mi-
nority member, who is always fair. I
had plenty of time. I asked basic ques-
tions. It came down to this:
Who did Secretary Perry meet with
regarding Ukraine and Naftogaz? He
was the head of a powerful department.
He was one of the self-styled ‘‘three
amigos.’’ Who else was in the loop?
What did they talk about?
Acting Secretary Brouillette only ac-
knowledged—he wasn’t willing to say

anything. This was a full court stone-
wall. He wasn’t willing to say anything
other than that there were meetings—
no other information and nothing sub-
stantive on the questions I asked. So I
just kept asking him.
Who took part in the meetings with
Secretary Perry on Naftogaz? When
and where did they take place? What
materials were produced? I don’t think
Secretary Perry just went to those
meetings all by his lonesome with
maybe a bag lunch or something like
that. My guess is that he had staff from
the Department of Energy with mate-
rials produced by the Department of
Energy.
Who outside of the Department did
Secretary Perry speak with regarding
changes in Naftogaz, and what was the
substance of those communications? It
is not like Secretary Perry would have
paid his own way and freelanced a
‘‘three amigos’’-Ukraine policy in se-
cret. This is the head of the Energy De-
partment. It looks like he was right in
the center of the Trump corruption
scheme in Ukraine.
I am just going to close in this way.
I don’t understand the rush. Mr.
Brouillette is at the Department of En-
ergy now. He is the acting chief. West-
ern civilization is not going to end if
the Senate insists on getting some an-
swers to the questions that I have pre-
sented this afternoon. We are still
going to have our powerplants and nu-
clear facilities running, and all of the
national security activities that go on
at the Department of Energy will still
go forward if the Senate takes the time
to require that there be substantive an-
swers to the questions that I have
asked of this nominee.
I believe it is malpractice for the
U.S. Senate to rush this debate before
getting answers from this administra-
tion, Mr. Brouillette, Secretary Perry,
and those who, I believe, could answer
these questions if they didn’t want to,
in effect, say to the U.S. Senate: We
are just going to pass here. You might
want to hold us accountable, but we
have a chance to just skip out, and we
are going to take it.
This is not the way the Senate is sup-
posed to work. That is why I cannot
support moving forward with this
nominee, and I will be voting no this
afternoon.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
BOOZMAN). Without objection, it is so
ordered.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President,
within a few minutes, we will be voting
on the President’s nomination for the
new U.S. Secretary of Energy, Dan
Brouillette. I am here to offer my sup-
port for Mr. Brouillette, and I hope my
colleagues will vote for him. I am con-
fident that, with his leadership, we will
continue to build on the progress we
have made under Secretary Rick Perry.
Secretary Perry has been a very ef-
fective Secretary of Energy during his
time here. He has used his executive
and political skills, which are consider-
able in his having been the Governor of
Texas longer than anybody and in his
having been involved in politics for a
while, to take charge of this very im-
portant Department and lead it in a
very strong way.
For example, one of the best kept se-
crets in Washington, DC, is that over
the last 5 years, we have had a record
level of funding for supercomputing,
which has allowed the United States to
be the first in the world in competition
with China and Japan and other coun-
tries. We have had significant increases
in funding for National Laboratories—
a 42-percent increase over 5 years. That
is record funding. Secretary Perry has
also helped to save taxpayers’ dollars
by having made sure the huge con-
struction projects we have in some of
the Department of Energy’s facilities
have been brought under control. So
Mr. Brouillette, should he be confirmed
by the Senate tonight, will be fol-
lowing a very distinguished Secretary
in Rick Perry.
I look forward to working with Mr.
Brouillette. I and Senator FEINSTEIN,
of California, are the chairman and
ranking member of the Subcommittee
on Energy and Water Development. We
have worked very well together over
the last, nearly, 10 years in supporting
the Department both under the Obama
administration and under the Trump
administration. We have worked in a
bipartisan way and have had strong
support from our colleagues, which has
been made possible by excellent Secre-
taries of Energy. I believe Mr.
Brouillette will be yet another one of
them.
He knows the Department well, as he
has been the Deputy Secretary since
2017. In my conversations with labora-
tory directors and others across the
country, they feel like he knows them
well. I know that this is true in Ten-
nessee. For example, at the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory, which is our larg-
est science and energy laboratory, Mr.
Brouillette has been crucial in the
building of the world’s fastest super-
computer, Frontier, which is housed in
Oak Ridge. As Senator FEINSTEIN and I
have insisted, he has also been crucial
in making sure that we stay on time
and on budget in the building of a huge
uranium processing facility at Oak
Ridge, which has been the largest Fed-
eral construction project in our State
since World War II, when the Manhat-
tan Project was created there.
Mr. Brouillette has visited the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory. He under-
stands the important work being done
there, both at the laboratory and at
the Y–12 uranium facility. He under-
stands the importance of the environ-
mental cleanup being done there and at
Hanford in Washington State and other
places.
In short, I think we are very fortu-
nate to have someone of his caliber and
his experience nominated to head one
of our most important Departments—
the Department of Energy.
I look forward as chairman of his ap-
propriations subcommittee, should he
be confirmed, to working with him dur-
ing this appropriations process, which
we hope is about complete, and during
the next one, which will be coming up
soon.
I am here simply to say that I sup-
port Mr. Brouillette. I am glad the
President nominated him. I hope he
gets a big vote in a few minutes. I look
forward to working with him.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia.
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise
today to speak about our nominee and
the vote for Secretary of Energy.
Mr. Brouillette came before the Sen-
ate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee 2 weeks ago. I found him to
be up to this enormous task. He is a
good man, and he has the credentials.
He came out of our committee 16 to 4,
and that is pretty impressive in today’s
toxic world that we live in, sorry to
say.
He has a long history with energy
issues and with the Department of En-
ergy, so he is no stranger to this agen-
cy or to the workings of this agency.
He has served as the staff director of
the House Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, so he understands the pro-
ceedings of this body and of the House.
At the Department of Energy, he
served as an Assistant Secretary of En-
ergy during the Bush administration
and, of course, as the Deputy Secretary
for the past 2 years under Secretary
Perry. He knows the Department; he
knows Congress; and he knows the en-
ergy issues facing our Nation.
He has also demonstrated his mana-
gerial skills. He has been vice president
of Ford Motor Company, and he has
been a senior vice president of USAA,
which I think we all know is the large
insurance and financial services giant
that serves the members of our mili-
tary and their families.
This Senate has confirmed him twice
before, and we have gone indepth in
looking into him, and he has been
forthcoming. He has not held anything
back. I asked him every question I pos-
sibly could. I know some of my dear
colleagues on my side of the aisle have
some concerns on some questions they
want answered. I did get into those
with him. He assured me that his an-
swers were accurate and correct, and I
found them to be very substantial.
I basically come before you to say
that we have a gentleman who I think
is well qualified. He is ready for the
job; he is up to the job; and he under-
stands the job. That is what we should
be looking at.
So if we could put politics aside—
truly put politics aside—and look at
the qualifications of a person who is
willing to serve and his family, who is

behind him 100 percent, wanting him to
give that service—he and his wife are
both former military people.
I found him to be quite charming,
quite delightful to work with and talk
to but, more than that, most profes-
sional in his approach and how he has
handled himself and in the way we
have worked with him in our com-
mittee. Being the ranking member on
the Energy and Natural Resources
Committee, I have worked with him,
and we have worked with him through-
out the last 2 years. He has been very
forthcoming and good to work with.
I urge all of my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle to please consider vot-
ing for this gentleman because I think
he is really the right person at the
right time for this job.
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO JAY GRASSLEY
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on
the Saturday before Thanksgiving, my
wife Barbara and I traveled to Carroll,
IA, for the induction of our youngest
son, Jay Grassley, to the Iowa Girls
Coaches’ Association Hall of Fame. Jay
earned this honor through his work
over the last 29 years as a volleyball of-
ficial. Jay has officiated the most Iowa
high school volleyball finals in history
with 14 games. With one exception, Jay
has officiated at every Iowa State
volleyball tournament since 1995. This
outstanding record demonstrates Jay’s
dedication to his work as an official.
In addition to his officiating, Jay has
been a coach and mentor to volleyball
players for more than 30 years. His in-
terest in volleyball started when he
was a student at the University of
Northern Iowa. Jay started the Six
Pack Volleyball Club in 1990, and after
years of building a strong reputation,
his team earned the USA Volleyball 18s
Division National Championship title
in 2011.
As I travel across Iowa for my annual
99 county meetings, I often run into
Iowans whose relationship with Jay
has had a lasting impact. They com-
monly ask that I tell Jay ‘‘hi’’ and fol-
low with a story of how he was a men-
tor and coach to them or one of their
children. As a father, those are heart-
warming sentiments for me to hear.
Jay’s kind nature and motivational
spirit help him to connect with people
of all ages and make his influence all
the more worthwhile. At the hall of
fame induction, Jay’s fellow coaches
and officials described him as ‘‘one of,
if not the best, official(s) out there.’’
Barbara and I are very proud of Jay
being named to the Iowa Girls Coaches’
Association Hall of Fame.

ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, section
36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act
requires that Congress receive prior no-
tification of certain proposed arms
sales as defined by that statute. Upon
such notification, the Congress has 30
calendar days during which the sale
may be reviewed. The provision stipu-
lates that, in the Senate, the notifica-
tion of proposed sales shall be sent to
the chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
In keeping with the committee’s in-
tention to see that relevant informa-
tion is available to the full Senate, I
ask unanimous consent to have printed
in the RECORD the notifications which
have been received. If the cover letter
references a classified annex, then such
annex is available to all Senators in
the office of the Foreign Relations
Committee, room SD–423.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:

ments or upgrades from the level of sensi-
tivity of technology or capability described
in the Section 36(b)(1) AECA certification 13–

France.
(ii) Sec 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 13–
40; Date: July 9, 2013; Military Department:
Air Force.
(iii) Description: On July 9, 2013, Congress
was notified by Congressional certification
transmittal number 13–40 of the possible sale
under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export
Control Act of 16 MQ–9 Reaper Remotely Pi-
loted Aircraft; 8 Mobile Ground Control Sta-
tions; 48 Honeywell TPE331–10T Turboprop
Engines (16 installed and 32 Spares); 24 Sat-
ellite Earth Terminal Substations; 40 Ku
Band Link-Airborne Communication Sys-
tems; 40 General Atomics Lynx (exportable)
Synthetic Aperture Radar/Ground Moving
Target Indicator (SAR/GMTI) Systems; 40
AN/DAS–1 Multi-Spectral Targeting System
(MTS)–B; 40 Ground Data Terminals; 40
ARC–210 Radio Systems; 40 Embedded Global
Positioning System/Inertial Navigation Sys-
tems; and 48 AN/APX–119 and KIV–119 Iden-
tify Friend or Foe (IFF) Systems. Also pro-
vided are spare and repair parts, communica-
tion, test, and support equipment, publica-
tions and technical documentation, air-
worthiness and maintenance support, site
surveys and bed down planning, personnel
training and training equipment, operational
flight test, U.S. Government and contractor
technical and logistics personnel services,
and other related elements of logistics sup-
port. The estimated total cost was $ 1.5 bil-
lion. Major Defense Equipment (MOE) con-
stituted $765 million of this total.
On July 26, 2018, Congress was notified by
Congressional certification transmittal num-
ber 18–0B of the retrofit of MQ–9s to become
weapons capable, and the inclusion of 100
GBU–49 Enhanced Paveway dual mode GPS
and laser guided bomb kits comprised of
MXU–650 Air Foil Group (AFG) and MAU–210
Enhanced Computer Control Group (ECCG);
200 FMU–152 fuzes; 650 AGM–114R Hellfire
missiles, with active warheads; 45 AGM–114R
Hellfire training missiles, without active
warhead; and 6 Hellfire Captive Air Training
Missiles. The retrofit and inclusion of MDE
not enumerated in the original notification
resulted in an increase in the cost of MDE by
$210 million. The new MDE cost was $975 mil-
lion. The total case value increased to $1.71
billion.
This transmittal reports the:
1) retrofit of four (4) MQ–9A Block 1 to MQ–
9A Block 5;
2) addition of four (4) MQ–9A Block 5; and
3) addition of fourteen (14) Embedded GPS/
INS (EGI) with GPS Security Devices.
The MDE cost of these items is $80 million,
resulting in a new MDE cost of $1.055 billion.
The total case value will remain $1.71 billion.
(iv) Significance: This notification is being
provided as the retrofit of the MQ–9A sys-
tems and the inclusion of MDE items not
originally notified represent an increase in
capability over what was originally notified.
This equipment will provide France’s MQ–9
program with the equipment necessary to
support the capability requested.
(v) Justification: This proposed sale will
support the foreign policy and national secu-
rity of the United States by helping to im-
prove the security of a NATO ally which con-
tinues to be an important force for political
stability and economic progress in Western
Europe.
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The MQ–9A
is a long-endurance, medium altitude Re-
motely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) that can be
used for surveillance, military reconnais-
sance, and targeting missions. MQ–9A is ca-
pable of performing real-time flown under
the control of a pilot in a Ground Control
Station (GCS). A data link is maintained
that uplink commands and downlink video
with telemetry data. The data link can be a
Line-of-Sight (LOS) CB and communication
or Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) Ku-Band
Satellite Communication (SATCOM). Air-
craft can be handed off to other strategically
placed ground control stations. The MQ–9A

netics, Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR), Syn-
thetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and other laser
target designators. Block 5 includes a rede-
signed forward avionics bay, NSA Type 1
encrypted data links, enhanced power, dual
wing-tip ARC–210 radios, payload control
computer, enhanced HMI and payload con-
trol in GCS.
(vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress:

push for a minimum wage increase in
Illinois and a $45 billion State infra-
structure package. He has been lauded
for his ‘‘steady hand’’ and leadership
and will no doubt be missed by his
membership and everyone in Illinois
that supports the rights of working
people.
I thank Mr. Carrigan for his service

RECOGNIZING R & H MACHINE,
INC.
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a mem-
ber and former chairman of the Senate
Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship, each month I recognize
and celebrate the American entrepre-
neurial spirit by highlighting the suc-
cess of a small business in my home
State of Idaho. Today I am pleased to
honor R & H Machine, Inc., located in
Caldwell, as the Idaho Small Business
of the Month for December 2019.
R & H Machine’s story began on a
wheat farm in Washington State in the
1950s. In an effort to supplement their
income, wheat farmers Ray and Arline
Stueckle began welding and selling re-
placement farm equipment made of
chrome alloy, a durable material that
greatly expanded the lifecycle of farm
equipment. After several decades of
growth, the family business moved its
operations to Caldwell in 1978 to better
serve its clientele across the Pacific
Northwest.
Today, R & H Machine is owned and
operated by the Stueckles’ daughter
and son-in-law, Kathy and Dave Organ.
The business manufactures and sells a
product line of about 1,500 parts made
from chrome alloy and distributes
thousands of farm tools across the U.S.
R & H Machine equipment is estimated
to last about 15 years longer than the
life of standard equipment and three to
five times longer than the life of hard-
faced equipment. Dave Organ is con-
stantly designing and developing new
parts at the request of his customers.
The Organ family prides itself on up-
holding the founder’s commitment to
providing the farmer the best deal pos-
sible and a superior product.
Congratulations to Dave and Kathy
Organ and all of the employees at R &
H Machine, Inc., for being selected as
the Idaho Small Business of the Month
for December 2019. You make our great
State proud, and I look forward to your
continued growth and success.∑

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The

A resolution (S. Res. 318) to support the

which had been reported from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, with
amendments, as follows:
(The parts of the resolution intended to be
stricken are shown in boldface brackets, and
the parts of the resolution intended to be in-
serted are shown in italics.)
S. RES. 318
Whereas the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis, and Malaria has been an effec-
tive partnership of governments, the private
sector, civil society, and affected commu-
nities to galvanize political and financial ef-
forts to improve the response to these
epidemics since 2002;
Whereas, in 2017, the Global Fund contrib-
uted to extraordinary improvements in glob-
al health that would otherwise not have oc-
curred, including a more than 50 percent re-
duction in the number of AIDS-related
deaths since the peak in 2005, a 37 percent de-
cline in tuberculosis (TB) deaths since 2000,
and a 60 percent decline in the number of
malaria deaths since 2000;
Whereas, since the Global Fund’s creation
in 2002, more than 27,000,000 lives have been
saved in the countries where it invests;
Whereas the Global Fund and its partners
work to maintain a steadfast commitment to
transparency and accountability and have
received high marks in multilateral aid re-
views and by independent watchdog groups;
Whereas a 2019 study published in the An-
nals of Global Health found evidence of asso-
ciated improvements in government ac-
countability, control of corruption, political
freedoms, regulatory quality, and rule of law
that are significant in countries where the
Global Fund invests;
Whereas, despite progress in combating
AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, challenges
such as drug and insecticide resistance,
reaching marginalized and vulnerable popu-
lations, and complacency in the fight against
infectious diseases threaten further progress;
Whereas United States leadership has been
critical to the success of the Global Fund,
both as its largest donor and through its
oversight role on the Board of the Global
Fund;
Whereas Global Fund programs and activi-
ties support and complement United States
bilateral health programs, including the
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief,
the President’s Malaria Initiative, and the
United States Agency for International De-
velopment tuberculosis program;
Whereas the United States is limited by
law from contributing more than 33 percent
of the Global Fund budget, thereby encour-
aging other partners to significantly in-
crease their contributions;
Whereas the Global Fund’s requirements
for co-financing have spurred domestic in-
vestments, with recipient countries commit-
ting 41 percent more of their own funding to
fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria for
2018–2020 compared to 2015–2017;
Whereas the Global Fund has called on do-
nors to support its Sixth Replenishment by
mobilizing a minimum of $14,000,000,000 in
donor commitments for 2021–2023;
Whereas Canada, the European Union, Ger-
many, India, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg,
Japan, Portugal, Switzerland, and the
United Kingdom have responded to the call
by significantly increasing their respective
pledges for the Sixth Replenishment;
Whereas recipient countries also are ex-
pected to increase their co-financing by 48
percent, growing to $46,000,000,000 in 2021–
2023; and
Whereas, with these resources secured, the
Global Fund projects it will reduce the num-
ber of deaths due to AIDS, TB, and malaria
by nearly 50 percent, avert 234,000,000 infec-
tions or disease cases, and save an additional
16,000,000 lives; Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) commends the work of the Global Fund
and its partners for their contributions
aimed at ending the epidemics of AIDS, tu-
berculosis, and malaria;
(2) affirms the support of the United States
for the goal of securing a minimum of
$14,000,000,000 in donor commitments for the
Sixth Global Fund Replenishment, to be held
on October 10, 2019, in Lyon, France;
(3) supports United States contributions of 33
percent of the budget provided by the Global
Fund’s Sixth Replenishment, consistent with
