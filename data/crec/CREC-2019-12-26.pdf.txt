PRAYER
Rabbi Arnold E. Resnicoff, Chaplain,
U.S. Navy, Retired, Washington, D.C.,
offered the following prayer:
Almighty God, we pray, reflect,
meditate in different ways. And during
these holy days—Christmas, Hanuk-
kah, Kwanzaa, more—some sing dif-
ferent songs, reflecting beauty, diver-
sity of communities, cultures, faiths
that make our Nation rich.
Yet we Americans, we the people,
share songs of unity beyond diversity.
When we embrace our Nation’s highest
dreams, our lives become its songs.
Of America, we sing: ‘‘O beautiful for
patriot dream that sees beyond the
years.’’
Of America, we sing: ‘‘O beautiful for
heroes proved, in liberating strife who
more than self, their country love, and
mercy more than life.’’
God bless our lives, our leaders, with
a patriot dream of love of country, love
of mercy, freedom, justice—over party,
over self; to cooperate, sacrifice, even
compromise for the ‘‘art of the pos-
sible,’’ for the greater good.
God bless America, we sing. Help us,
we pray, forever make this Nation wor-
thy of that blessing and that song.
And let us say, Amen.

IMPEACHING DONALD JOHN
TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES, FOR HIGH
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS
SPEECH OF
HON. JUAN VARGAS
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 18, 2019
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Speaker, I rise to
speak on the impeachment articles introduced
in the U.S. House of Representatives to im-
peach Donald John Trump. Earlier this week
over 750 historians published a statement
condemning Donald Trump for his flagrant
abuses of power and urged the House to im-
peach him. In just a couple of days that num-
ber has quickly doubled, with a total of 1,507
signatures.
These historians highlighted that one of our
Founding Fathers, Alexander Hamilton, wrote
impeachment was created to deal with the
‘‘misconduct of public men’’ which involves
‘‘the abuse or violation of some public trust’’.
This exactly what Donald Trump has done,
time and time again.
Our Constitution was written to ensure there
are checks on our power as elected officials.
It ensures that we cannot become kings; that
we remain public men and women. That is the
foundation upon which our country was built.
In a democracy, our rulers are the people, the
citizens, our constituents, and we were chosen
to stand in public office to serve them.
The Founding Fathers wrote the Constitu-
tion, but it is our actions in high office that give
those great words meaning and power. As
public servants we are trusted to abide by the
law and to only use our positions in office to
protect and support our country.
Donald Trump has used the power of the
presidential office for his own personal gain,
violating the trust of the American people.
He has withheld from our ally, Ukraine,
$391 million in military and security assist-
ance. That $391 million was approved for
Ukrainian assistance by Republican and
Democratic members in legislation that passed
the House and the Senate. Congress, finding
common ground in our American values that
compel us to support our ally, provided this
money. But Donald Trump put it on hold.
To leave our ally’s civilians and soldiers to
struggle as they fight against our shared ad-
versary and dangle this congressionally-ap-
proved aid in front of them, is alone bad lead-
ership. It is the behavior that stains our coun-
try, tarnishing our name in the eyes of coun-
tries who look to us as leaders of the free
world. But leaving our allies without support is
an offense Trump tends to repeat, and it alone
is not the impeachable offense.
Trump used his trusted power over congres-
sionally-approved money, our constituents’
money, not to protect our ally or our constitu-
ents, but to bolster his chances in winning our
next presidential election. The United States
Ambassador to the European Union testified
that Donald Trump would release this aid and
meet with the Ukrainian president in person
only if Ukraine publicly announced an inves-
tigation into Trump’s political rival, Former
Vice President Joe Biden. He abused his
trusted power. That is the first impeachable of-
fense.
Congress moved to seek out the truth for
the American people, but Donald Trump con-
tinued to block this co-equal branch of govern-
ment. Following the orders of Donald Trump,
nine witnesses from the White House have
defied congressional subpoenas, included in
twelve White House officials who have refused
to testify. Despite congressional requests and
legal subpoenas, no documents have been re-
leased from the White House for the congres-
sional inquiry. The single transcript that was
released prior to the inquiry has been defined
as a ‘‘rough’’ transcript, its omissions flagged
by a trusted national security official who lis-
tened in to the call that the transcript de-
scribes. Finally, Congress has invited Donald
Trump to engage in the inquiry, yet he has re-
jected that invitation. Donald Trump is keeping
the American public in the dark, knowing that
if light were fully shed on his actions, he would
hold much less influence and power over their
judgement.
There has been no president before Donald
Trump who has so completely defied congres-
sional oversight or sought to impede it. When
he wholly blocks the availability of information
to a duly elected co-equal branch of govern-
ment responsible for oversight and investiga-
tions into the executive branch, he holds an
unprecedented amount of control.
That is the second impeachable offense.
Since the founding of our great nation we
have celebrated public servants who put their
country before themselves, and rejected kings
and tyrants, who put themselves before their
country. The great women and men in our
past that stood on this floor upheld the words
of the Constitution and shielded our democ-
racy from those who attempted to exploit it.
Few times in history have we had such a
historic vote.
We ask ourselves today, will we stand with
the man that believes Article II of the Constitu-
tion allows him to, quote, ‘‘Do anything I
want’’?
Will we stand with the man who said noth-
ing would happen to him if he shot someone
of Fifth Avenue in New York City?
Will we stand with the man who abuses the
same laws our constituents abide by, the laws
we have pledged to protect, and the laws he
swore under oath to faithfully execute?
Or will we stand up as protectors of our
Constitution, and of our nation?
Our names will be tied to our votes.
I urge my colleagues to support both articles
of impeachment and hold Donald Trump ac-
countable for his flagrant abuses of power.
