IN RECOGNITION OF RABBI SAM-
UEL SANDHAUS FOR HIS CON-
TRIBUTIONS TO HIS COMMUNITY
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 8, 2019
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Rabbi Samuel Sandhaus
for his service to his community. Rabbi
Sandhaus has dedicated his life to the service
of his country and his fellow citizens, and will
be honored for his contributions and achieve-
ments on Sunday, October 27, 2019.
Rabbi Sandhaus earned a bachelor’s de-
gree in economics and ordination, as well as
a master’s in Bible studies, from Yeshiva Uni-
versity. He also earned an MBA in finance and
management from Boston University, and
postgraduate certificates in health service ad-
ministration and gerontology from Marywood
University. Answering the call to serve his
country in 1971, he served as a chaplain in
the United States Army until 1979, and he was
awarded the Army Commendation Medal with
two Oak Leaf Clusters.
After his time in the Army, Rabbi Sandhaus
was licensed as a nursing home administrator
by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. He
was then named the Assistant Executive Di-
rector of the Jewish Home of Eastern Pennsyl-
vania in 1979, beginning his four-decade ca-
reer with the organization. He served as Asso-
ciate Director from 1981–1983 before being
named the Executive Director in 1983. During
his tenure, the Jewish Home became a leader
in provisional long-term care in the region.
Under his thoughtful direction and leadership,
Jewish Home purchased 20 acres of land in
Clarks Summit to build Elan Gardens, a per-
sonal care facility. Rabbi Sandhaus retired
from the organization in 2019.
Rabbi Sandhaus’ colleagues have often
sought his professional opinion and experi-
ence. He served as the co-chair of the Quality
Assurance Committee for the Association of
Jewish Aging Services; president of Sigma Phi
Omega; president of both the National Geron-
tology Academic and the Professional Honor
Society’s Scranton Chapter; and in various
other capacities for the Association of Jewish
Aging Services. He also offered his expertise
as a management consultant for Elan Gar-
dens.
Rabbi Sandhaus has been an active leader
in his community. He served as community
co-chair and chair of the United Jewish Cam-
paign; director of the Scranton Hebrew Jewish
Day School; director of both the Scranton
Counseling Center and the United Way of
Lackawanna; chaplain for the Sandy
Weissberger/Leon Kaplan Post 165 Jewish
War Veterans; an instructor at Marywood Uni-
versity School of Continuing Education; and
secretary/treasurer of Webster Towers Senior
High-Rise.
It is an honor to recognize Rabbi Sandhaus
for his contributions to the Jewish community
and elder care services in Northeastern Penn-
sylvania. His professional career and personal
endeavors have enriched the lives of many,
and I hope his spirit of serving his fellow citi-
zens inspires many generations to come.

CONGRATULATING THE
ALLEGHANY RESCUE SQUAD ON
ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. VIRGINIA FOXX
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 8, 2019
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Alleghany
Rescue Squad in North Carolina’s Fifth District
on its 50th anniversary. The story behind this
rescue squad is a truly remarkable testament
to the strength and character of this commu-
nity.
On September 12, 1969, high school stu-
dents, Linda Pennington and Johnny Johnson,
collided with a tree while driving from the
school football game. Both were trapped in-
side the car for hours before they could be
taken to the hospital.
At the scene of the wreck, hundreds gath-
ered and did what they could to help, but with-
out jaws of life and other rescue equipment,
they were not able to save Linda and Johnny.
The community responded to this horrible
tragedy by coming together to make sure next
time disaster struck, it would be prepared.
Local leaders gathered men and women to
form the rescue squad. Soon, with the help of
the Elkin Rescue Squad, CPR classes were
underway, and so was the squad’s fundraising
campaign. The rescue squad made appeals to
the community for money to buy a truck, all-
purpose first-aid kit, resuscitator, jaws of life
and many other life-saving tools.
The response from community members
was incredibly generous and the Alleghany
Rescue Squad continues strong today, com-
prised entirely of volunteer workers—including
three of its charter members—who raise all
funding for equipment and rescue classes.
These men and women are true heroes, al-
ways ready to save when lives are in danger.
They prove that when neighbors are in
need, the community around them can provide
the best help, and I am very proud to rep-
resent citizens who so selflessly serve their
fellow citizens.

CONGRATULATING DEANNA PRICE
FOR BREAKING THE AMERICAN
HAMMER THROWING RECORD
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 8, 2019
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in
congratulating DeAnna Price for breaking the
American hammer throwing record with her
throw of 256 feet and 8 inches.
Overcoming severe injuries that put her ath-
letic career in jeopardy, DeAnna bounced
back even stronger to make history. DeAnna
should be commended for her hard work and
dedication throughout this past year and for
breaking the national record.
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in
recognizing DeAnna Price for a job well done.

COMMEMORATING THE ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE BURNING OF THE
ROUGE RIVER
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 8, 2019
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
mark the anniversary of the burning of the
Rouge River in Wayne County, Michigan.
Fifty years ago, the Rouge River caught fire.
For years and years, this vital waterway,
which flows into the Detroit River and is an im-
portant link in the industrial supply chain, had
been polluted. The rampant and unchecked
contamination of the Rouge culminated in the
build-up of a sludge so flammable that the
river went up in flames as high as fifty feet tall.
The conflagration sounded the alarm on the
effect of unchecked pollution, irresponsible
corporate actions, and dumping of oil and
other toxins into our waterways. An immediate
call to action ensued. Residents organized
clean ups and advocated for policy changes
that would protect our water. Through the per-
severance of those residents and community
grounds, their dogged pursuit of stronger regu-
lations to clean up the Rouge eventually
helped turn things around.
Without the tremendous advocacy and work
of organizations like Friends of the Rouge and
countless others, the Rouge River would look
very different today. These efforts mean that
our water is cleaner, our waterways are pre-
served for recreation, and wildlife and their
habitats are protected.
Please join me in rising to commemorate
this solemn occasion. May it serve as a re-
minder in how far we’ve come in protecting
our natural resources and the work that we
still need to do to protect our waterways.

IN HONOR OF THE INDUCTION OF
THE CONSTANCE BAKER MOTLEY
ESTATE INTO THE CONNECTICUT
FREEDOM TRAIL
HON. JOE COURTNEY
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 8, 2019
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to highlight an important development in
my district. On Sunday, October 6th, the es-
tate of the renowned civil rights activist, law-
yer, and judge, Constance Baker Motley, was
designated as a heritage site on the Con-
necticut Freedom Trail.
The Connecticut Freedom Trail is a state
designation which recognizes carefully se-
lected sites that celebrate extraordinary Afri-
can Americans whose lives have greatly ex-
panded the circle of freedom and opportunity
for all Americans. Judge Motley, an icon of
civil rights advancements and justice for all,
kept a home away from home in the town of
Chester, part of Connecticut’s Second District,
for 40 years.
It is important that we recognize this historic
site because of the extraordinary life and leg-
acy of Judge Motley. Born and raised in New
Haven, CT, Judge Motley was a first genera-
tion American, the child of Caribbean immi-
grants. At an early age, a local philanthropist
offered to fund her college education, after
hearing her speak at a community event. After
graduating from New York University, she at-
tended Columbia Law School at which point
she joined the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund.
As a contemporary of great civil rights activists
like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, and Justice
Thurgood Marshall, Judge Motley helped liti-
gate most of the defining civil rights cases of
the era, including the landmark Brown v.
Board of Education.
After a successful career as a lawyer and
activist, she became the first female African
American New York State Senator. Then, in
1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed
her to the federal district court for the South-
ern District of New York, making her the first
black woman to serve on the federal judiciary.
There, she spent the next 40 years shaping
the legal landscape of the 20th century and
even became the court’s Chief judge. It was
during this part of her life that Judge Motley
often escaped to her Chester home with her
family.
I’d like to thank the Chester Land Trust and
the greater Chester community for embracing
Judge Constance Baker Motley’s legacy by
preserving her home and estate. I’d also like
to thank the Motley and Coleman families for
being so supportive of this endeavor.
We honor Judge Constance Baker Motley’s
life and legacy by inducting her historic home
into the Connecticut Freedom Trail. Col-
leagues, I ask that you please rise and join
me in acknowledging this special occasion
and the incredible woman we have to thank
for it.

HONORING JEREMIAH KAHMOSON
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 8, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor Jeremiah
Kahmoson for his incredible commitment and
support of education and youth in our commu-
nity.
Jeremiah Kahmoson was born and raised in
Sonoma County and believes in giving back to
the next generation of students. Mr.
Kahmoson is a teacher at the North Bay Met
Academy and serves as the Executive Direc-
tor of the B-Rad Foundation, which works to
empower individuals through environmental
stewardship, health, and adventure programs.
In August of 2014, he lost his best friend
Bradley ‘‘B-Rad’’ Parker in a tragic climbing
accident in Yosemite National Park. The B-
Rad Foundation was founded in Brad’s mem-
ory and based upon the three pillars of his life:
Health, Stewardship, and Adventure. Today,
the B-Rad Foundation seeks to create a uni-
verse where children live a life where every
year features 365 days of awesome.
For the past five years, the B-Rad Founda-
tion has supported thousands of kids and their
families with fun-filled programs and events.
They have partnered with the King Ridge
Foundation to lead extended back-country ad-
ventures for Sonoma County youth in Yosem-
ite National Park. They were instrumental in
the giveaway of over 500 bicycles for dev-
astated children, who lost all their possessions
in the 2017 wildfires. The B-Rad program also
practices an important ‘‘pay-it-forward’’ philos-
ophy, as they train students in bike mainte-
nance and help them to use their newly ac-
quired repair skills to fix donated broken bikes
and re-gift them to local at-risk youth. Mr.
Kahmoson’s deep commitment to enriching
the education of our youth through environ-
mental stewardship has become a deeply ap-
preciated part of our community.
Madam Speaker, Jeremiah Kahmoson is a
passionate adventurer and educator who has
made great contributions to better the lives of
others in our community. It is therefore fitting
and proper that we honor him here today.

Tuesday, October 8, 2019
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise

LIPS and Annalise Glick on their remarkable
partnership and to wish them well on a lifetime
of marriage.
Congressman PHILLIPS and Annalise were
wed in a beautiful ceremony on September

parency, we credit much of his success to the
steady and creative hand of his wife, Annalise.
Her life’s work brings joy to so many, and we

IN HONOR OF LEO J. FAHEY OF
MASSACHUSETTS
HON. STEPHEN F. LYNCH
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 8, 2019
Mr. LYNCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
honor of Leo J. Fahey, in recognition of his
outstanding contribution to the American labor
movement, and to his home union, Pipefitters,
Local 537 in Massachusetts.
The son of Leo Fahey and Audrey York
Fahey from South Boston, Massachusetts,
Leo was born on August 2, 1960, in South
Boston. He is the youngest brother to sisters
Catherine Fahey-Fennessey and MaryBeth
Fahey Moore, and a brother, Sean Fahey. Leo
attended grammar school at St. Mary’s in
Randolph, Massachusetts and graduated from
Randolph High School in 1978. He furthered
his education earning an associate degree
from Blue Hills Technical Institute, becoming
an expert in HVAC technology and its applica-
tions.
Madam Speaker, Leo entered Pipefitters
Local 537 in 1983 as an apprentice. He has
served his union well serving as Super-
intendent at Kinetic Systems, and P.J. Riley in
Weymouth. He was elected president of Local
537 in 2002 and served in that capacity until
2004. Subsequently he was elected as Busi-
ness Agent (2004 to 2010), Trustee (2007 to
2016), and Business Manager (2010 to 2016).
Leo also played a key in the enactment of im-
portant state legislation which allowed munici-
palities to save energy costs by replacing ar-
chaic systems with state of the art facilities.
Additionally, Leo played a key role in the Hel-
mets to Hardhats initiative where returning vet-
erans from Iraq and Afghanistan could receive
training in the construction and building trades
as a means to gaining a secure career and
enjoying the solidarity of fellow Union Mem-
bers.
Leo’s most enduring work on behalf of Local
537 was yet to come. He improved the Union
Hall and outfitted it with modern technology.
He established a scholarship fund for union
members and their spouses, children and
grandchildren, awarding over $700,000 to
date. He along with union brothers William
Gallagher, John Messina, Robert Mullin, and
James Walsh created a Memorial Wall where
each member of Local 537 will be remem-
bered for his and her contribution and dedica-
tion to the Pipefitters Union, Local 537.
Leo is known for his quick sense of humor
and his loyalty to his friends. He is a proud
son of his South Boston roots and a fierce ad-
vocate for working families. He is the life part-
ner and fiancé of Diane McArthur, the proud
father of four sons: Justin, Ryan, Patrick, and
Brendan, and the grandfather of Aiden, Mary,
and Joshua.
Madam Speaker, it is my distinct honor to
join with Leo J. Fahey’s family, friends, and
contemporaries to thank him for his remark-
able service to the American labor movement
and to the Pipefitters, Local 537.

LETTERS OF ENDORSEMENT FOR
H.R. 1595, THE SAFE BANKING ACT
HON. DENNY HECK
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 8, 2019
Mr. HECK. Madam Speaker, I include in the
RECORD the following letters of endorsement
for H.R. 1595, the SAFE Banking Act, which
passed the House on September 25, 2019.
COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA,
DEPARTMENT OF BANKING AND SE-
CURITIES,
Harrisburg, PA, September 24, 2019.
Hon. NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY,
Republican Leader, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCAR-
THY: As state banking supervisors, we are re-
sponsible for ensuring the safety and sound-
ness of state-chartered banks and credit
unions, as well as the regulation of non-de-
pository financial service providers that may
provide services to these entities. The finan-
cial services industry in state authorized
marijuana jurisdictions is unable to effec-
tively service the needs of this new and
growing industry because of conflicting fed-
eral and state regulation for marijuana.
Medical marijuana is available to 67 per-
cent of the country’s population, and 11
states have legalized adult recreational use.
This significant portion of the country’s pop-
ulation is funding a growing cannabis indus-
try. The lack of federal safe harbors or au-
thorization for financial service providers is
creating commercial risk for the legitimate
marijuana industry, due to the lack of finan-
cial servicing of these monies.
This absence of servicing encourages a
grey economy, as the industry’s participants
are unable to use safe, regulated, and
verifiable money services. Until financial in-
stitutions can serve the industry without
violating federal laws, then tax collection,
consumers, and the financial system will re-
main at risk.
Until Congress can take broader action to
more comprehensively address cannabis, we
support the passage of H.R. 1595 to provide a
safe harbor for depository institutions that
supply financial services to legitimate mari-
juana businesses and allow for the trans-
parent and safe banking of the marijuana in-
dustry.
We urge a YES vote on H.R. 1595.

DEAR CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS: As our
States’ chief executives, we urge Congress to
pass legislation allowing states with legal-
ized medical or adult-use cannabis to operate
safely and under the scrutiny of the national
banking system. We strongly support the
passage of the Secure and Fair Enforcement
(SAFE) Banking Act (H.R. 1595) and (S. 1200)
or similar legislation that would remove the
legal uncertainty for banks and credit
unions, reducing their risk, enhancing public
safety, and increasing financial trans-
parency.
We were pleased that the House Financial
Services Committee held a subcommittee
hearing on cannabis and financial services on
February 13, and we were especially encour-
aged to see that H.R. 1595 passed the full
committee on a strong bipartisan basis on
March 28. We urge the full House to pass this
legislation to help provide banking services
to state-licensed cannabis businesses.
State and federal governments have a
shared interest in upholding the rule of law,
protecting public safety, and transitioning
markets out of the shadows and into our
transparent and regulated banking system.
Without access to banking services, state-li-
censed cannabis businesses operate predomi-
nantly on a cash basis. This poses a signifi-
cant public safety risk to customers and em-
ployees. Additionally, because banking serv-
ices are barred, these businesses are unable
to write checks, make and receive electronic
payments, utilize a payroll provider, or ac-
cept credit and debit cards. The cash-only
environment puts an additional burden on
state and local government agencies that
must collect tax and fee payments, in person
and in cash, incurring additional public ex-
penses and employee safety risks.
Currently, thirty-four U.S. states, three
U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia
have legalized the medical use of cannabis.
Additionally, ten states and the District of
Columbia have legalized recreational use by
adults over 21 years of age. Despite legaliza-
tion of cannabis at the state-level—in many
cases to provide medical treatment—our fi-
nancial institutions face enormous barriers,
legal risks, and criminal and civil liability
under the Controlled Substances Act that
prevent them from providing banking serv-
ices to state-licensed businesses. As a result,
very few banks and credit unions will pro-
vide these services, leaving many businesses
in this sector unbanked.
Many of our states have implemented laws
and regulations that ensure accountability
of the cannabis industry. However, without
banking services, cannabis businesses are
less able to obey the law, pay taxes, and fol-
low these important regulations. The public
safety risks posed by these cash-only busi-
nesses can be mitigated through access to
banking service providers.
To adequately address these issues, we
urge Congress to pass legislation, such as the
SAFE Banking Act (H.R. 1595) and (S. 1200),
that would provide a safe harbor for deposi-
tory institutions that provide a financial
product or service to a cannabis business in
states that have legalized it. We look for-
ward to working with you as legislation pro-
gresses to address this urgent public policy
concern.
Sincerely,
Philip D. Murphy, Governor, New Jersey;
Jay Inslee, Governor, Washington;
Tony Evers, Governor, Wisconsin;

Justice, Governor, West Virginia; Gary

GACC STATEMENT ON THE SAFE BANKING ACT
The Global Alliance for Cannabis Com-
merce (GACC) announces its endorsement of
the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE)
Banking Act.
The SAFE Banking Act is sponsored by
Representatives Ed Perlmutter (D–CO),
Denny Heck (D–WA), Steve Stivers (R–OH),
Warren Davidson (R–OH), and over 200 other
members of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, and Senators Jeff Merkley (D–OR),
Cory Gardner (R–CO), and nearly thirty
other members of the U.S. Senate.
Cannabis banking issues have long been
both a significant hamper on industry
growth vis-à-vis access to capital and a pub-
lic safety risk—including the risk of kidnap,
torture, and mutilation for the purposes of
extortion—by compelling a cash-laden indus-
try.
But beyond the well-documented industry
issues cannabis entrepreneurs and small
businesses encounter, the lack of banking ac-
cess puts a significant onus on the 200,000-
plus employees of U.S. cannabis businesses.
Cannabis businesses have extreme logistical
difficulty providing benefits to employees,
providing a payroll system, and applying
withholdings. Oftentimes, GACC member-
business employees are forced to live cash
lifestyles without access to proper retire-
ment or healthcare savings. We urge the
swift passage of this act.
‘‘The questions lawmakers have to grapple
with in legalizing cannabis are serious. The
job of the federal government now is not to
upset the existing multi-billion dollar U.S.
cannabis market and to allow state markets
to flourish through wise use of its commerce

HONORING THE 30TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF PERFECTING CHURCH
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 8, 2019
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize Perfecting Church, a growing min-
istry and house of worship in Detroit, on its
thirtieth anniversary.
Perfecting Church held its first service in
1989 in the home of Pastor Marvin L. Winans
with a congregation of only eight people. The
church and its congregation grew quickly and
found its self in need of a building before ulti-
mately settling into its current home on De-
troit’s east side. The church’s final move was
symbolic of two of its guiding principles, unity
and serving others. Since its opening, Per-
fecting Church’s mission to serve and bring
community together has been reflected in its
outstanding charitable work and its service-
based programs. Under the leadership of Pas-
tor Winans, Perfecting Church has expanded
its services to include youth programming,
performing arts, as well as transitional housing
for women in the community. Perfecting
Church is a community asset to Detroit and
has truly become an integral part of its faith-
based community.
Please join me in tribute to Perfecting
Church in honor of its thirtieth anniversary and
its ongoing community service.

RECOGNIZING ORANGE COUNTY
CONSERVATION CORPS FOR 25
YEARS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE
AND ENVIRONMENTAL STEW-
ARDSHIP
HON. HARLEY ROUDA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 8, 2019
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the Orange County Conservation
Corps (OCCC) and its 25 years of service in
the Orange County, California community.
OCCC was founded in 1993 and is a voluntary
work and learn program for at-risk and dis-
advantaged youth ages 18 to 25.
Over the course of the last quarter century,
OCCC has provided career guidance and
workforce training to more than 8,000 young
adults. Because of the OCCC’s hard work and
dedication, Corps members have received
more than $1.5 million in financial assistance,
received pay for nearly two million hours of
work and job training. and have earned over
3,000 high school diplomas and job certifi-
cates.
OCCC’s dedication to the young adults of
Orange County is only rivaled by their dedica-
tion to environmental stewardship and con-
servation. Since its founding, OCCC has pro-
tected and restored nearly 3,000 acres of pub-
lic land, diverted 9,000 tons of recyclable ma-
terial from landfills, and planted more than
120,000 native plants and trees. They exem-
plify true dedication to Orange County and our
communities’ public lands.
I ask that all Members join me in recog-
nizing the amazing work and contribution of
OCCC.

RECOGNIZING RICK AND MARY
MCQUEARY
HON. BILLY LONG
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 8, 2019
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the incredible work and life of Rick
and Mary McQueary.
Rick McQueary and Mary Haseltine
McQueary are a couple with a deep love and
respect for the rich history in Springfield and
Greene County. Each of their families arrived
in Greene County in the mid to late 1800s.
Rick’s family began a pharmacy business in
Ash Grove, Missouri and later moved it to
Springfield where it grew into the premier drug
wholesaler in southwest Missouri. Mary’s fam-
ily was active in farming and had the largest
apple orchards in Missouri. Others in her fam-
ily, including her father, were interested in
practicing law and were noted lawyers in the
area. Family stories fostered a love of learning
about the history of this community still exist
for both of them today.
Mary currently serves as the president of
the Board of Directors of History Museum on
the Square, has been an active volunteer with
the Museum for over 19 years, and has spent
the last several years spearheading the devel-
opment and construction of the Museum’s new
facility that opened in August of 2019. She
and Rick are the co-chairs of the capital cam-
paign for the Museum and she has served as
the project manager for the Museum’s con-
struction project, overseeing a team of indus-
try professionals, steering the direction of mu-
seum content, writing copy and even picking
out finishes. This project is one of the largest
historic revitalization projects in downtown
Springfield. The ultra-modern History Museum
on the Square is projected to attract 30,000
visitors each year with galleries featuring the
Birthplace of Route 66, the first Wild West
shootout with Wild Bill Hickok, and many other
stories of the unique Ozarks crossroads.
Rick and Mary have been able to show oth-
ers that historic buildings and local history are
worth preserving. The new facility allows the
Museum to provide additional educational and
community programming for both children and
adults. Downtown is the heart of our commu-
nity and this museum is the perfect place to
tell the rich history of Springfield. So much of
the area’s history occurred right outside the
windows of the Museum—the Trail of Tears,
Civil War encampments, the first quick draw
shootout in the Wild West, the Butterfield-
Overland Stage route, and Route 66. Pre-
serving and promoting this history while also
contributing to downtown revitalization and im-
proved tourism is a gift to the entire commu-
nity.
Their love of this community is only rivaled
by the great love they have for their alma
mater Greenwood Laboratory School and sur-
passed by their love for their family. They
have been married for forty-four years and
have three children and eight grandchildren.
Rick and Mary’s willingness to serve has led
them to participate in all parts of the commu-
nity including boards of major medical facili-
ties, schools, universities, civic organizations,
and their church. They have worked tirelessly
to better the community they love so dearly.
The History Museum on the Square is proud
to award them the inaugural William F. ‘‘Rick’’
McQueary and Mary Haseltine McQueary
Groundbreaker Award for their years of dedi-
cated service to the preservation and display
of the history of Springfield and Greene Coun-
ty. This award will now be presented annually
to an individual, family or corporation making
significant contributions to the History Museum
on the Square and its mission.
Madam Speaker, it is clear the McQueary’s
have an unbelievable love for their community
and its history and am honored to be able to
recognize them today.

RECOGNIZING THE WORKERS AT
THE ADVANCED MIXED WASTE
TREATMENT PLANT
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON
OF IDAHO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 8, 2019
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
with great respect and gratitude for the 480
men and women of the Advanced Mixed
Waste Treatment Project (AMWTP) as they
complete the facility’s waste treatment mission
for the State of Idaho and the country.
The State of Idaho didn’t generate the
waste treated at AMWTP, but the citizens of
Idaho along with the entire nation benefitted
from our nation’s unrelenting drive to keep the
peace through our strength. In many ways, the
waste that the AMWTP team retrieved, char-
acterized, treated, certified, and shipped out of
the state was the byproduct of our freedom. It
was the legacy of the Cold War. Through their
hard work, dedication, and sacrifices, they
helped close the chapter on this part of the
Cold War.
In addition to the AMWTP employees, we
owe Idaho governors Cecil Andrus, John
Evans, Dirk Kempthorne, Jim Risch, Phil Batt,
C.L. ‘‘Butch’’ Otter, and Brad Little a great
thanks for their insistence that this waste
would not remain in Idaho in perpetuity over
our precious Snake River Plain Aquifer. Our
aquifer, our citizens, and our nation are safer
with this waste safely disposed of at the
Waste Isolation Pilot Plant.
We also owe the Department of Energy
(DOE) a heartfelt thank you for committing to
this project in the mid-1990s and staying with
it until the end. It wasn’t easy; it wasn’t without
contention or disagreements, but all sides
worked together for a common goal of suc-
cess.
The contractors that have been associated
with the AMWTP also must be recognized,
from BNFL Inc., to Bechtel BWXT, to the
Idaho Treatment Group, to the current con-
tractor; Fluor Idaho. The amount of ingenuity,
engineering, and technology at this waste
treatment facility is unmatched anywhere else
in the world. AMWTP, backed by the DOE and
its contractors and committed management
and employees, had the brawn and brains to

complete its transuranic debris waste treat-
ment mission.
But none of this would have been possible
without the men and women of the AMWTP.
Each and every one of them made sacrifices
to support this mission. They sacrificed quality
time with family members to commute to the
facility in the early hours of the morning, often
leaving at night—never seeing the light of day.
They knew they were effectively working
themselves out of a job, just as all employees
of the Idaho Cleanup Project are doing.
The employees of the AMWTP should be
the models for the entire workforce of the
DOE Complex. When they encountered chal-
lenging waste types and containers, they de-
veloped the procedures and processes to
safely and compliantly address them. When
the specialized equipment didn’t exist, they
fabricated it, tested it, and put it to work. They
adapted and found solutions to the most com-
plex challenges they encountered.
Several more years will be needed to ship
out the balance of the 65,000 cubic meters of
waste to WIPP. For those who stay with the
project, the Idaho Congressional Delegation
wishes them the best of luck in safely carrying
out the remainder of the shipping mission.
For those who retire, take other jobs in
Idaho, or leave to pursue opportunities else-
where, we wish them the best of luck and
again sincerely say thank you. AMWTP and
the impact of its workforce to the State of
Idaho and the nation will be remembered for
generations to come.

HON. ROBERT E. LATTA
OF OHIO

Tuesday, October 8, 2019
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
celebrate the dedication of Ohio Northern Uni-
versity’s James Lehr Kennedy Engineering
Building. The 105,000 square foot building is
already fostering a community of technological
growth, innovation, and collaboration at the
university. The additional room and lighting
make it easier for students to work with faculty
in an environment conducive to learning.
Ohio’s 5th Congressional District is home to
more than 60,000 manufacturing jobs, and fa-
cilities like this state-of-the-art engineering
building will help prepare students for the jobs
of tomorrow.
The construction of this building would not
have been possible without countless people
that provided financial support. Special rec-
ognition is reserved for James Lehr Kennedy,
who has given his continuous support and
dedication to the university.
This new facility will provide students with
excellent new learning opportunities and will
help them to reach their maximum potential.
The dedication of this new building is great for
students, great for the university, and great for
the region. Congratulations to Ohio Northern
University!

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 8, 2019
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in

Church, a house of worship in Detroit, Michi-
gan.
Founded in 1959, Power Hope and Grace
Bible Church has persisted and prevailed de-
spite the many changes in the City of Detroit.
The church and its congregation have contin-
ued to thrive because of their incredible com-
mitment to community service and generosity
to those in need. The Power Hope and Grace
community has regularly provided assistance
and supplies to local shelters for the home-
less, runs an annual back to school fair, offer-
ing free school supplies, hair cuts, and more,
and assists in annual holiday toy drives. Be-
yond its charitable works, the congregation
has been a training site for the Michigan Alli-
ance for Families and participated in the Ca-
reer Works summer program. In addition to
this milestone anniversary, Power Hope and

HONORING THE 40TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF BIG SUR HEALTH CEN-
TER
HON. JIMMY PANETTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 8, 2019
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize and celebrate the 40th Anniver-
sary of the establishment of the Big Sur
Health Center. Big Sur Health Center opened
in 1979 with a mission to bring quality medical
care to the rural community of Big Sur and
continues to serve as the only medical facility
in the immediate area. The non-profit center
provides affordable, culturally sensitive
healthcare centering on diverse patient needs
to both residents and visitors alike. When it
opened, Big Sur Health Center offered serv-
ices one day a week and facilitated 850 pa-
tient visits a year. Recognizing the need in the
area and with community-wide fundraising
support, the center quickly expanded to a
2,100 square-foot medical facility providing
services five days a week. To date, they have
administered more that 73,000 patient visits.
In its 40 years of service to the central coast
of California, Big Sur Health Center has grown
to meet the needs of our local community.
Their team has developed vital programs and
services, including a pharmaceutical service
for urgent care medications and supplies, a
fully-equipped dental suite to provide full-serv-
ice oral healthcare, chiropractic care, acupunc-
ture care, and a multicultural outreach pro-
gram. Their bilingual staff aims to provide per-
sonalized, comprehensive, and holistic care to
the diverse cultures and communities in Big
Sur.
With unpredictable coastal hazards and fre-
quent geographic and climate challenges, the
Big Sur community faces unique medical
needs. Big Sur Health Center has responded
to these needs by offering 24-hour-on-call
service and home visits and coordinates with
local emergency teams during extreme weath-
er conditions and natural disasters. In recent
years, the center has offered healthcare serv-
ices to thousands of firefighters during six
large-scale fires. They have remained innova-
tive in their response to local needs, working
in partnership with medical facilities on the
Monterey Peninsula to limit the need for resi-
dents to commute 30-miles for laboratory test-
ing and other immediate medical services.
I am honored to recognize Big Sur Health
Center and its important contributions to the
health of residents on the Central Coast over
the past 40 years. They have made incredible
progress from their small clinic in 1979 and
will undoubtedly continue to evolve with the
needs of the community to provide quality, af-
fordable healthcare services to our rural coast-
line. Madam Speaker, I ask that my col-
leagues join me in congratulating and thanking
Big Sur Health Center for 40 years of service
to our community.

HONORING THE LIFE OF PATRICIA
‘‘TRISH’’ B. (PAINTER) ANDRE
HON. MARCY KAPTUR
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 8, 2019
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to remember Patricia B. ‘‘Trish’’ Andre of
Wauseon, Ohio, who left this world for a high-
er grace-filled existence on Friday, August 2,
2019.
As we remember Trish, we are reminded of
a life dedicated to our earth’s fabric in agri-
culture. A graduate of Purdue University, her
academic studies were based in science
where she received a degree in Agronomy.
Serving as a Certified Crop Advisor, a 4–H
Advisor, a member of the Ohio Jersey Breed-
er’s Association, and a member of the Farm
Bureau, Trish led an extraordinary life dedi-
cated to agriculture.
I can still see her stooping in the fields pick-
ing off tiny creatures on plants, studying their
meaning, marveling at nature and its infinite
connection to a higher cosmos. Her work rais-
ing the next generation of her own family and
the larger 4–H youth family is legendary. She
was a prophetess in her own time.
Trish’s deep dedication to agriculture was
shared with her loving husband of 34 years,
Nathan (Nate) L. Andre who survives her.
Nate and Trish formed a strong bond in mar-
riage and as agricultural stewards. He is a
proud organic and fanning consultant for
Andre Farms, a family-owned business that
has served Ohio and Michigan communities
for over 60 years. I know Nate will honor his
wife’s memory by upholding the Andre Farms’
mission of integrity driven land stewardship.
As a parishioner of the North Clinton Church
in Wauseon, Ohio, Trish was a devout woman
of faith. As a member of Gideon International
Auxiliary, a Christian nonprofit, and a Bible
Quiz Coach, her service to community was
firmly rooted in faith.
Trish will be profoundly missed by her
friends, family, and the community she served.

was taken well before her time, may they find
peace in knowing she is peacefully at rest in
the earth she faithfully tended. Now her power
for betterment of life on earth assumes new
dimension and one that is eternal. May God
provide her angelic spirit soft clouds and rising
suns so her goodness showers upon human-
kind in unending waves.

HONORING PUBLIC SERVANT
DAVID HIGGERSON
HON. FILEMON VELA
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 8, 2019
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor David P. Higgerson on his retirement
from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection
(CBP), Laredo Field Office.
As Director of Field Operations (DFO) at the
Laredo office, Director Higgerson was respon-
sible for enforcement activities at eight inter-
national Ports of Entry (POEs), extending from
Brownsville to Del Rio, and the Machinery
Center for Excellence and Expertise. The eight
POEs include 21 vehicle crossings, eight air-
ports, three rail crossings, and one seaport.
These crossings are some of the nation’s
busiest, and Mr. Higgerson’s organization
safely processed nearly 59.4 million people,
more than 21 million vehicles, over 3.5 million
commercial trucks, and an excess of $194 bil-
lion in international trade in Fiscal Year 2018.
He also served in the Joint Task Force-West,
which disrupts transnational criminal organiza-
tions from operating in South Texas.
Director Higgerson is a proven leader in the
community who leads by example. In 2018, he
was awarded the Secretary’s Meritorious Serv-
ice Silver Medal for his leadership and service
to the Department of Homeland Security. He
also earned the Commissioner’s Strategic
Problem Solving Award for the South Texas
Railroad Strategic Problem Solving Initiative,
and Assistant Commissioner recognition for
his outstanding contribution to the Land Bor-
der Directive Working Group.
Mr. Higgerson is a graduate of the St. John
Military Academy and holds an Associate’s
Degree in Accounting. After honorably serving
in the U.S. Army, he was Customs Inspector
at the Panama Canal Zone and was then
transferred to Laredo, Texas in 1978. He was
also Port Director in Hidalgo-Pharr, Texas,
and DFO in El Paso, Texas and Tucson, Ari-
zona.
It has been an honor to work with Director
Higgerson for the past seven years. I thank
him for his service in keeping our borders
safe, while also taking care of our officers on
the front line. As we celebrate David P.
Higgerson’s retirement, I ask my colleagues to
join his family, our community, and me in rec-
ognizing his legacy and wishing him a happy
retirement.
