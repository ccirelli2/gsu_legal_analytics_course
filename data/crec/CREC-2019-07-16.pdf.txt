IN RECOGNITION OF MARY
PHILLIPS WHITE GETTYS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN) for 5
minutes.
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to celebrate the life of a truly
great American, Mary Phillips White
Gettys, who will turn 99 on August 6 of
this year.
Ms. Gettys was born in Chester,
South Carolina, on August 6, 1920,
which was the same year that women
gained voting rights. She graduated
from Chester High School, where she
was valedictorian of her senior class.
She enrolled in Erskine College and
graduated in 1941 with a degree in
music.
Her first job was teaching junior high
school in Anderson, South Carolina,
and she later joined WAVES, which
stands for Women Accepted for Volun-
teer Emergency Service, in 1943. She
began her training at Mount Holyoke
College in South Hadley, Massachu-
setts, where she specialized in commu-
nications while studying at Smith Col-
lege in North Hampton, Massachusetts.
She was assigned to the communica-
tions office in the Norfolk Navy Yard
in Portsmouth, Virginia.
After achieving the rank of lieuten-
ant, she was tasked with the com-
plicated task of coding and decoding
communications received and sent by
the Naval Command. Her duties in-
cluded delivering urgent top secret
messages to military leaders, where
she would have to strap on her weapon
and be escorted across the yard to de-
liver the vital information.
In 1946, Ms. White left the Navy and
began working for AAA, the American
Automobile Association, located in
Charlotte, North Carolina.
In 1947, she met Tom Gettys, whom
she would become engaged to after 3
weeks and married 3 months after their
engagement. Little did she know that
she would become the lifelong partner
of a man who would successfully be-
come the Fifth District Congressman
of South Carolina, where he would
serve for five terms until retiring in
1974.
They returned to his hometown of
Rock Hill, South Carolina, where they
would raise two daughters, Julia Mar-
tin Gettys Burchett and Sara Elizabeth
Gettys Pierce. The Gettys were mar-
ried for 56 years until the death of Con-
gressman Gettys in 2003.
Mary Phillips Gettys is a true leader
in her community and received many
awards, including: Woman of the Year
from the First ARP Church, where she
faithfully attended; the Cross of Mili-
tary Service from the United Daughter
of the Confederacy in 2001; the Quilt of
Valor award in 2015, presented by the
Quilts of Valor Foundations for vet-
erans touched by war; the National
Award in 2017, presented from DAR, the
Daughters of the American Revolution
for Women in American History.
Mary Phillips Gettys is the proud
and devoted grandmother of six grand-
children and three great-grandchildren.
She is the epitome of a gracious and
charming Southern lady, and by her
life, she has demonstrated a love for
her God, a love for her family, the love
of her fellow man, and the love of her
great country.
She is a true American patriot who
always has a smile on her face and has
lived her life in true service to her fel-
low man.
f
RESOLUTION TO IMPEACH
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
and still I rise; because I love my coun-
try, I rise.
And I rise today to ask a question of
all people of good will. I rise today to
pose a question: What do you do when
the leader of the free world, when the
leader of the country that extolls lib-
erty and justice for all—government of
the people, by the people, for the peo-
ple, all persons are created equal and
endowed by their creator with certain
inalienable rights—what do you do
when the leader of the free world is a
racist? What do you do?
Well, here is what you do: You file a
resolution, a resolution condemning
the President for racist comments di-
rected at Members of Congress.
What do you do? You file Articles of
Impeachment impeaching the Presi-
dent of the United States of America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5830 July 16, 2019
These two things are not mutually
exclusive. We can condemn for the
comments that have been made, and we
can impeach for the harm that the
comments are causing to our society.
Both of these things can be done, and
neither will interfere with the Mueller
report. The Mueller report—some 90
days now the President has been above
the law since the Mueller report was
made public.
What do you do? You pass this reso-
lution.
I intend to support it, and I thank
the gentleman who filed it for doing so.
I believe it is a good resolution.
One of the statements in this resolu-
tion that has been reported widely is
that the President presented racist
comments that have legitimized fear
and hatred. I will salute and support
the resolution, but you also will hear
this resolution to impeach. I would like
to read to you what it says in part:
Impeaching Donald John Trump, President
of the United States.
Then it goes on to read:
The aforementioned, Donald John Trump,
has, by his statements, brought the high of-
fice of President of the United States in con-
tempt, ridicule, disgrace, and disrepute; and
has sown discord among the people of the
United States; has demonstrated that he is
unfit to be President, and has betrayed his
trust as President of the United States to
the manifest injury of the people of the
United States; and has committed a high
misdemeanor in office. Therefore, Donald
John Trump, by causing such harm to the so-
ciety of the United States, is unfit to be
President and warrants impeachment, trial,
and removal from office.
Those who tolerate bigotry perpet-
uate bigotry.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.

CONGRATULATIONS TO THE STU-
DENTS OF NORTHERN CAMBRIA
MIDDLE SCHOOL—SKILLSUSA
GOLD MEDALISTS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recogni-
tion of the impressive career and tech-
nical education students in Pennsylva-
nia’s 15th Congressional District.
Career and technical education helps
learners of all ages gain valuable skills
that have the potential to lead to good-
paying jobs and rewarding careers. It
all starts with our Nation’s most valu-
able resource: our people. Hardworking
men and women and the dedicated stu-
dents who have chosen to pursue a
technical career are the backbone of
our economy.
As co-chair of the bipartisan House
Career and Technical Education Cau-
cus, I couldn’t be happier to congratu-
late Jakob Dixon of Indiana County,
Pennsylvania, on recently winning a
gold medal for his work with sheet
metal at the SkillsUSA National Lead-
ership and Skills Conference. The 56th
annual event took place in Louisville,
Kentucky, and hosted upwards of 6,500
students to compete in more than 100
different skills-based competitions.
Jakob will be a senior this fall in the
Heating, Ventilation, and Air Condi-
tioning program at the Indiana Career
Technology Center.
Additionally, in Cambria County,
Pennsylvania, Northern Cambria Mid-
dle School celebrated its back-to-back
national championships in the 41st an-
nual Technology Student Association
national conference in Washington,
D.C., just earlier this month.
More than 8,500 students from across
the country competed in 70 different
events, including woodworking, pro-
gramming robots, debate, and more.
Every student from Northern Cambria
Middle School who competed in the
contest achieved national recognition
as a top 10 finalist.
Mikey Konitsky, Chris Yahner, Pey-
ton Myers, and Braden Moriconi be-
came national champions in the me-
chanical engineering competition, a
category they have also won in the
Commonwealth State of Pennsylvania.
Additionally, Chris Yahner and his
classmate Caleb Born placed third in
the Nation in structural design and en-
gineering, and Garret Link placed
ninth in the Nation for flight endur-
ance.
I am proud of Jakob Dixon and the
students of Northern Cambria Middle
School and the many students like
them across the Commonwealth and
the country who have chosen to pursue
a skills-based career in such a competi-
tive workforce.
Students like these are in high de-
mand. More than 80 percent of manu-
facturers claim talent shortages pre-
vent them from keeping up with cus-
tomer demand, and 46 percent of em-
ployers say they have difficulty finding
talent, particularly in the skilled
trades.
Career and technical education pre-
pare students to be career ready by
providing core academic skills, em-
ployability skills, and technical job-
specific skills through hands-on learn-
ing opportunities.
We need more students like Jakob,
Mikey, Chris, Peyton, Braden, John,
Caleb, and Garret. The value they will
add to the American workforce one day
cannot be overstated.
f
REFUGEE ADMISSIONS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Alabama (Mr. BROOKS) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, the President is Commander in
Chief. His highest constitutional duty
is protecting American lives.
As of 2016, so-called refugee admis-
sions from the Middle East, Near East,
South Asia, and Africa accounted for 80
percent of so-called refugee admissions
into America.
I say ‘‘so-called refugees’’ because
the United Nations states no country is
obligated by international law to take
refugees from a country in which they
are already protected.
The result of America’s flawed pol-
icy? America is the world’s top refugee
resettlement country on the planet.
In a 2015 Breitbart interview, I op-
posed these dangerous refugee policies
and stated: ‘‘Barack Obama wants to
endanger Americans by importing peo-
ple, some of whom undoubtedly will re-
sort to terrorism and killing Ameri-
cans at some point in the future.’’
Consistent with my view that im-
porting unvetted people from terrorist-
laden countries threatens American
lives, the House, in 2015, passed a law
requiring a full FBI background inves-
tigation for alleged Iraq or Syria refu-
gees. The bill died in the Senate while
under an Obama veto threat.
In 2017, a newly elected President
Trump stated: ‘‘In order to protect
Americans, the United States must en-
sure that those admitted to this coun-
try do not bear hostile attitudes to-
ward it and its founding principles. The
United States cannot, and should not,
admit those who do not support the
Constitution or those who would place
violent ideologies over American law.’’
b 1015
‘‘In addition, the United States
should not admit those who engage in
acts of bigotry or hatred, including
‘honor’ killings, other forms of vio-
lence against women, or the persecu-
tion of those who practice religions dif-
ferent from their own.’’
As expected, socialist Democrats and
their fake news media allies reacted by
calling President Trump names rather
than supporting policies that save
American lives.
For example, House Speaker NANCY
PELOSI said: ‘‘This week, I joined my
colleagues on the steps of the Supreme
Court to fight the President’s rep-
rehensible order. . . . The values illus-
trated were in stark contrast with the
President’s unconstitutional, immoral,
and dangerous ban on refugees and citi-
zens of Muslim countries coming into
the United States.’’
Predictably, a radical, leftist judge
restrained President Trump from pro-
tecting American lives. Fortunately, a
later President Trump refugee and
travel policy was approved by the Su-
preme Court as ‘‘squarely within the
scope of Presidential authority.’’
As would be expected, this decision
was ridiculed with hysterical headlines
from the left. NBC News stated, ‘‘The
Supreme Court’s travel ban decision
adds to its legacy of legitimizing rac-
ism.’’
Protecting Americans from terrorism
is ‘‘reprehensible,’’ ‘‘immoral,’’ ‘‘rac-
ism’’? This is all ignorant and baseless
socialist Democrat and fake news
media slander intended to stifle ration-
al debate.
But truth eventually wins out. Re-
cently, an unvetted so-called Syrian

refugee who entered America 3 years
ago was charged with terrorism. Ac-
cording to an affidavit filed in Pitts-
burgh Federal court, the FBI investiga-
tion of Mustafa Mousab Alowemer ‘‘re-
vealed that Alowemer plotted to bomb
a church located on the north side of
Pittsburgh . . . using a weapon of mass
destruction, i.e., an explosive device.’’
According to Alowemer, his motiva-
tion to detonate a device at the church
was to ‘‘support the cause of ISIS and
to inspire other ISIS supporters in the
United States to join together and
commit similar acts in the name of
ISIS.’’
Fortunately, the FBI stopped
Alowemer from blowing up a church
and slaughtering innocent American
Christians. Unfortunately, American
lives are still at risk from terrorists
masquerading as refugees.
Mr. Speaker, I ask: How many dead
Americans does it take to cause open-
border advocates to secure our borders
and protect American lives?
Unfortunately, no one knows because
socialist Democrats have shown there
is no amount of American blood on
their hands that will cause them to
protect American lives by securing
America’s borders.
f
RECOGNIZING ROSE MARIE
STRIPPOLI
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5
minutes.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize Rose Marie
Strippoli, an accomplished artist from
Bristol, Pennsylvania.
In addition to receiving numerous
awards throughout her career, her
most recent acrylic painting titled
‘‘The Passage’’ was recognized as best
in show at the 70th Tinicum Arts Fes-
tival last week. Her abstract painting,
combining vibrant colors with master-
ful strokes, stood out amongst submis-
sions from more than 180 artists at the
festival.
In addition to her artistic excellence
and success, she has tirelessly advo-
cated for local artists in the Bucks
County area. One of her most notable
accomplishments was her work to es-
tablish an exhibit at the Lower Bucks
Campus of the Bucks County Commu-
nity College featuring a rotation of
pieces from local artists. The exhibit
opened in 2015 and has highlighted
many up-and-coming local artists since
that time.
Her constant drive to better herself
as a person and as an artist earned her
a spot in the Centre for the Arts Hall of
Fame in Bristol in 2016.
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Rose
Marie on her accomplished career and
extend to her the best of luck in her fu-
ture endeavors. Her work has improved
opportunities for young artists in our
community, for which we owe her
many thanks.
COMMENDING THE LIFESAVING ACTIONS OF
POLICE OFFICER RYAN BUNDA
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to commend the brave and
lifesaving actions of Police Officer
Ryan Bunda of the Warminster Town-
ship Police Department.
On July 11, 2019, Officer Bunda ob-
served a white pickup truck rolling
slowly down a busy roadway in his pa-
trol area. Officer Bunda, in an act of
incredible bravery and initiative, ran
alongside the truck, opened the door,
and used his hand to press the brake,
bringing the vehicle to a halt.
The driver of the truck was suffering
from a seizure, and Officer Bunda, with
the help of a local firefighter who was
passing on the other side of the road,
removed the victim from the vehicle
and administered lifesaving first aid on
the side of the road.
With the help of this firefighter and
the additional medical assistance of
EMTs, who arrived shortly after, Offi-
cer Bunda saved the driver from life-al-
tering harm or death, as well as pro-
tecting the safety of other drivers on
the roadway.
This act of bravery on behalf of Offi-
cer Bunda serves as a reminder of the
debt of gratitude we owe to the incred-
ibly brave and selfless public servants
in law enforcement.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Officer Bunda
for his brave actions and his career of
service, and I extend thanks to all first
responders and law enforcement offi-
cials across Bucks County and across
our country.
HONORING THE LIFE AND MEMORY OF TROY M.
PEREIRA
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker,
today, I rise with a heavy heart to
honor the life and memory of Troy Pe-
reira of Falls Township, Pennsylvania,
a graduate of Pennsbury High School
and a gifted student-athlete.
Troy held a career as a warehouse lo-
gistics specialist for H&M in Bur-
lington, New Jersey.
Troy participated in community
sports programs, such as the Morris-
ville Babe Ruth baseball team and the
Morrisville Bulldog team. He was also
a member of the championship
Pennsbury men’s volleyball team,
which qualified for the State volleyball
championship in 2013.
Athletics aside, Troy is remembered
as a generous and kind soul who was
deeply loved by all who met him. My
heart goes out to his parents, Matthew
A. Pereira and Kathleen Holder Hirko,
and her husband, Jeffrey Hirko; his
brother, Kyle Pereira; and his sister,
Chelsea Pereira.
Troy’s life was taken from us too
soon. In the short time he was with us,
Troy was a leading example of the im-
portance of community engagement.
May he now enjoy his eternal reward
for a life he spent serving others.
HONORING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF APOLLO 11 MOON
LANDING
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. SPANO) for 5 minutes.
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor the 50th anniversary of
the Apollo 11 Moon landing.
Fifty years ago, Neil Armstrong,
Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins
launched from Florida’s coast at Ken-
nedy Space Center with the goal of
being the first to step foot on the
Moon.
On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong ac-
complished what was only a short time
prior believed to be impossible. He be-
came the first man to set foot on the
Moon, uttering the famous words,
‘‘That’s one small step for man, one
giant leap for mankind.’’
Those words ring through history,
but it is important that we also recog-
nize the hundreds of scientists, engi-
neers, mathematicians, and support
staff who worked tirelessly to ensure
mission success but do not receive the
public recognition that they deserve
for their contributions.
One example of this is Susan Finley.
She began her career as a computer
programmer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory and wrote software for the
Deep Space Network. That software
made it possible to hear the trans-
missions from the Moon that showed
the world what was possible when the
United States committed to achieving
the impossible.
I am also incredibly proud that 50
years after this accomplishment, Flor-
ida remains at the forefront of space
exploration. Today, the new crew cap-
sules designed to launch American as-
tronauts into space are being built, and
I hope that by the end of this year, in
which we are celebrating the first
Moon landing, we will again see Amer-
ican astronauts climb into American-
built capsules and launch into space
from Florida’s shores.
We have relied on Russian spacecraft
for too long, and this will inspire a new
generation of American children to de-
velop a passion for exploration and to
pursue science, technology, engineer-
ing, and mathematics education, just
as the Apollo program did 50 years ago
when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin
became the first to set foot on the
Moon.
President George Bush said: ‘‘Man-
kind is drawn to the heavens for the
same reason we were once drawn into
unknown lands and across the open
sea. We choose to explore space be-
cause doing so improves our lives and
lifts our national spirit. So let us con-
tinue the journey.’’

stranger to pageants, as she had also
previously been named Miss Florida
Citrus.
To win this latest competition, she
was able to showcase her skills as a
collegiate dance major, a talent she
uses to express her dreams and her
struggles.
She has plans now to use her other
college major of public relations to
help promote Florida’s economic and
cultural strengths.
Michaela will promote her social im-
pact initiative called Brave & Beau-
tiful, which encourages women to de-
velop healthy habits while living pur-
pose-driven lives. Brave & Beautiful
has already launched conferences in
multiple schools in central Florida and
has made an impact internationally in
Kenya, Guatemala, and the Dominican
Republic.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to hear how
Michaela is using her many gifts to
help transform lives, and I applaud her
efforts. She is a wonderful role model
for our young women.

Almighty and loving God, we lift our

We thank You for the gift of life from
the womb to the tomb.
We thank You for the gift of our be-
loved country of the United States of
America, land of opportunity and bea-
con of hope.
At the opening of today’s meeting,
we ask You to bless the Members of
Congress, inspire them to seek Your
guidance, to walk the way of love, to
look for the well-being of every citizen.
May they become instruments of peace
and ministers of love in the world tor-
mented by hatred and divisions, so that
they collaborate together instead of
competing against each other.
We make this prayer in Your name,
for Yours is the kingdom, the power,
and the glory, forever and ever.
Amen.

WELCOMING BISHOP A. ELIAS
ZAIDAN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the gentleman from Illinois
(Mr. LAHOOD) is recognized for 1
minute.
There was no objection.
Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor Bishop Abdallah Elias
Zaidan of the Maronite Catholic faith
and a valuable member of our Lebanese
American community in the United
States.
Born in Ksseibe, Lebanon, Bishop
Zaidan is the youngest bishop to lead
the Eparchy of Our Lady of Lebanon of
Los Angeles. As a Lebanese American
myself, I am honored to have Bishop
Zaidan come to Washington to open
the House floor for prayer this morn-
ing.
In 1984, Bishop Zaidan professed his
perpetual vows as a member of the
Congregation of the Lebanese Maronite
Missionaries and was ordained a priest
2 years later. Since then, Bishop
Zaidan committed his life to serving
others and was recognized for that
service with his appointment by Pope
Francis as the third bishop of the
eparchy.
I would like to commend Bishop
Zaidan for his continued service in the
community and as a champion for the
protection of children and a missionary
to those of all faiths. I am grateful for
his work in the Lebanese American
community, and I would like to sin-
cerely thank him for coming this
morning to bless the House in prayer.

OPEN AN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY
(Mrs. KIRKPATRICK asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
have a responsibility as a Congress-
woman, former prosecutor, and Amer-
ican citizen to stand up for the rule of
law.
After countless conversations with
my constituents, after speaking with
legal scholars and experts, after re-
viewing the Mueller report, and after
seeing administration officials defy
congressional subpoenas, I have come
to the conclusion that the House of
Representatives must open an im-
peachment inquiry on President Don-
ald Trump.
Following Mueller’s alarming report,
it is our job as a Congress to conduct
oversight and deliver answers to the
American people. Unfortunately, the
President has called upon his adminis-
tration to break the law and ignore our
congressional subpoenas. Now we have
no choice but to open an impeachment
inquiry.
This should not be a partisan fight or
a debate about election strategy; it is
about the rule of law.
I know impeachment is risky, but al-
lowing this President to defy the law is
even more risky. If we don’t act now,
our democracy may be threatened for
years to come.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
HONORING THE LIFE OF HARRY K.
WEAVER
(Mr. DUNN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to honor the life of the late Harry K.
Weaver of Live Oak, Florida. From a
very young age, Mr. Weaver had an un-
wavering desire to serve others and
make the world a better place.
Mr. Weaver was born in 1929 in Bris-
tol, Florida. Shortly after earning his
degree at Florida State University, he
enlisted in the United States Army.
Following years of service to our
country, he returned to Florida, where
he would dedicate more than 33 years
of his life first as the administrator,
then the president of the Florida Sher-
iffs Youth Ranches, a program that has
served over 150,000 children.
Harry was also a founding member of
the National Association of Homes for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5833
July 16, 2019
House will raise the wages of 40 million
Americans.
It has been 10 years—10 years—since
the Federal minimum wage has been
increased. It has been stuck at $7.25
since July 24, 2009. During that time,
the cost of living has gone up 18 per-
cent.
Today, a full-time worker earning
the minimum wage working year-round
without even a week’s vacation, they
earn only $1,250 a month, or $15,000 a
year. It is far below the monthly ex-
penses for the average family of $3,000,
which is what the monthly expenses
are.
A new report from the Joint Eco-
nomic Committee on which I serve as
vice chair shows that today’s minimum
wage doesn’t even cover the cost of
housing for the typical American fam-
ily. The minimum wage is far from a
living wage.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support the Raise the Wage Act and in-
crease it to $15 by 2024.
f
MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING
EMILY KATHRYN GOSS
(Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to celebrate the life of Ms. Emily
Kathryn Goss of Caesar, Mississippi,
whose life was unfortunately cut short
on July 12 at the age of 17.
Emily was a captain of the cheer
team at Hancock High School, where
she would have been a senior this up-
coming fall semester. She was a hard-
working honor student who stayed ac-
tive in various clubs. When she wasn’t
at school, Emily worked at the Coun-
try Side Diner and was also a baby-
sitter.
Emily is remembered for being a lov-
ing, kindhearted young woman who
was always smiling and loved life. She
was a faithful member of her youth
group at Union Baptist Church.
She is survived by her parents, Kevin
and Christina Goss, as well as her sis-
ter, Elise, whom she shared an insepa-
rable bond with. My thoughts and pray-
ers are with her loved ones as they
grieve the loss of Emily.
Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to join
me in a moment of silence to honor the
life of Ms. Emily Kathryn Goss.
f
HUMANITARIAN STANDARDS
(Mr. RUIZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, earlier this
month, we learned of two Facebook
groups in which CBP agents made hate-
ful comments about the women, chil-
dren, and asylum-seekers under their
custody and, therefore, their responsi-
bility.
This kind of racism, xenophobia, and
violent misogyny is unacceptable. CBP
must be held accountable to end these
shameful comments and the cruel, in-
humane treatment of children in their
custody.
We can’t simply fund supplies and ex-
pect a behavior change. That is why I
am grateful to Homeland Security
Committee Chairman THOMPSON and to
Chairman NADLER and Chair LOFGREN
of the Committee on the Judiciary for
holding a markup of my bill, the Hu-
manitarian Standards for Individuals
in CPB Custody Act, to ensure our
treatment of children, women, and
families is consistent with the prin-
ciples of basic human dignity.
My bill sets the basic standards we
need to create a comprehensive public
health approach to the humanitarian
challenges at our border. Together, we
are moving this bill forward to prevent
children from dying and restore hu-
manity to our treatment of children
under the custody and responsibility of
the Federal Government.
f
IN HONOR OF THE LIFE OF EVA
MOZES KOR
(Mr. BUCSHON asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor the incredible life of
Eva Mozes Kor. Eva was a friend, a
Holocaust survivor, and an inspiration
to us all.
As a young girl, Eva and her family
were held at the Auschwitz concentra-
tion camp. While at Auschwitz, Eva
and her twin sister, Miriam, were sub-
jected to inhumane medical experi-
ments by the Nazi doctor Josef
Mengele until their liberation in 1945.
Eva and her sister were the only
members of their family to survive the
horrors of Auschwitz. Despite this dark
atrocity, Eva used her life to spread
the message of forgiveness.
Eva married Michael Kor in 1960 and
later that year moved to Terre Haute,
Indiana, in my district, where they
raised two children.
Eva also spent decades teaching Hoo-
siers the importance of finding peace,
healing, and hope. In 1995, Eva opened
the CANDLES Holocaust Museum in
Terre Haute, creating a permanent
home to remind us of the power of for-
giveness and compassion.
Eva passed away, peacefully, at the
age of 84 during her annual trip to Po-
land.
Eva Kor was an incredible woman of
integrity, spirit, and forgiveness, and
her story will be shared for generations
to come. May her memory be a bless-
ing.
f
AMERICAN WORKERS DESERVE A
FAIR WAGE
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr.
Speaker, this week, for the first time
in a decade, the House will vote to in-
crease the Federal minimum wage to
$15 an hour. This legislation is long
overdue.
Most economists believe that our
country is suffering from a crisis of in-
come inequality. It is virtually impos-
sible for a working family to get by, let
alone get ahead, working a—or several
minimum wage jobs.
Instead of actually increasing wages,
this President and our Republican col-
leagues have showered the wealthiest
with trillions in tax cuts that will
never have a meaningful impact on
economic growth and opportunity.
This Congress needs to promote the
dignity of work, and that starts with
increasing the value of that work and
paying Americans a fair wage. And the
economic security that a fair wage will
provide gives families the opportunity
to participate in the economy and not
struggle in its shadows.
So as a matter of basic fairness and
dignity, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the Raise the Wage Act.

WIDOW’S TAX: STILL TIME TO DO
THE RIGHT THING
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, it has been 3 legislative days
since House Democrats undermined the
Military Surviving Spouses Equity Act
by shifting the bipartisan bill into a
partisan NDAA.
There is still time to correct the wid-
ow’s tax on spouses of servicemembers
whose lives were lost during Active
Duty or through a service-connected
cause.
Members of Congress know this legis-
lation is critical, with over 365 cospon-
sors being 86 percent of the Members of
Congress.
Congress needs to act out of respect
of members of the military and their
families.
According to the ongoing WUSA 9 re-
port, thousands of surviving military
spouses feel their government has
abandoned them. This is unconscion-
able.
As Edith Smith, a surviving spouse,
said, those who died earned this ben-
efit. It is not a gratuitous benefit.
They earned it.
Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, God bless
our troops, and we will never forget
September the 11th in the global war
on terrorism.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5834 July 16, 2019
These words were a deplorable, big-
oted act that betrays the principles of
our great Nation and demeans the
memories of all those who sacrificed so
much in our ongoing pursuit of a more
perfect Union.
Whether you were born here, arrived
as an immigrant, or came as a refugee,
every citizen, naturalized or otherwise
is an American, every bit as much as
our Founders.
Our country is stronger because of
our history as a people of diverse back-
grounds with diverse experiences.
Mr. Speaker, I stand here today, the
grandson and great-grandson of immi-
grants who fled the persecution of Jews
in Russia a century ago to build a bet-
ter life in America for themselves and
their future generations. We have seen
from history what happens when good
people stay silent.
To quote the late Elie Wiesel: ‘‘We
must take sides. Neutrality helps the
oppressor, never the victim. Silence en-
courages the tormentor, never the tor-
mented.’’
I urge my colleagues: Do not remain
silent. Speak out and defend the values
we all share as Americans.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.

HONORING EXCEPTIONAL STU-
DENTS GRANT HELMS AND ASH-
TON WHITE
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to recognize two exceptional students
from Rowan County, North Carolina.
Recently, Grant Helms, a rising sen-
ior at West Rowan High School, and
Rowan-Cabarrus Community College
student Ashton White competed in the
SkillsUSA Championships, a national
competition for career and technical
education students.
Grant and Ashton each won first
place in secondary and postsecondary
masonry, respectively, and we couldn’t
be more proud of them.
None of this would have been possible
without Rodney Harrington, the ma-
sonry teacher at West Rowan High
School and mentor to these students.
Mr. Speaker, these skills are impera-
tive in helping build and grow our
economy, so I think it is worth men-
tioning H.R. 2353, the Strengthening
Career and Technical Education Act.
This monumental bill, which became
law last year, has given States like
mine more flexibility to meet the
unique needs of their students, edu-
cators, and employers.
f
ANNIVERSARY OF THE SENECA
FALLS CONVENTION
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I often
reflect on the wise words of Margaret
Mead: ‘‘Never doubt that a small group
of thoughtful, committed citizens can
change the world: Indeed, it is the only
thing that ever has.’’
Never has this proven more true than
when women of all ages and cir-
cumstances gathered in Seneca Falls in
upstate New York 161 years ago this
week and changed forever the course of
history.
These thoughtful, dedicated, pas-
sionate women stood up and declared
to the world that all men and women
are created equal.
The convention sparked a fire in
women across the country, formally
birthing the women’s rights movement
and eventually paving the way for
women’s suffrage.
We hear the echoes of their voices
today as we continue the fight they
began so long ago. Let this anniversary
reinvigorate us as we carry on its leg-
acy, fearlessly committed to securing
equal rights, equal pay, and the funda-
mental right of every woman to choose
what happens to her body.

HEALTHCARE PARITY FOR
TERRITORY RESIDENTS
(Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN of Puerto
Rico asked and was given permission to
address the House for 1 minute and to
revise and extend her remarks.)
Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN of Puerto
Rico. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in full
support of the Territories Healthcare
Act, which is scheduled to be consid-
ered in full committee markup tomor-
row.
This bill addresses the multiple dis-
parities of the Medicaid program in all
U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico.
Medicaid on the island has a funding
cap and a limitation of 55 percent of
the Federal Medical Assistance Per-
centages, impacting the island’s ability
to furnish healthcare costs and services
for close to 1.4 million people in Puerto
Rico.
This bill will address these issues, in-
creasing the cap and adjusting the
FMAP for 4 years. If we do not address
this issue, we are challenging medical
access and services to approximately
1.4 million of my people.
Current social and political problems
should not eliminate our under-
standing of what the people need and
our responsibility toward them.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
continue their support and advocacy
for healthcare parity for territory resi-
dents.
f
TRUMP’S TWEETS MERIT
CENSURE
(Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to call out the
blatant racism in the President’s
tweets.
I believe his rant and his defense of
that rant merit censure from this body.
The phrase ‘‘Go back where you came
from’’ is a racist trope that has been
used by segregationists, neo-Nazis,
White nationalists, and the Ku Klux
Klansmen to create a framework in
which non-White people are not truly
American.
Describing non-White countries as
‘‘broken’’ and ‘‘crime infested’’ echoes
the racist trope the President has used
before that such countries are dysfunc-
tional, dirty, and violent because their
populations are Black.
His comments are indefensible, and
so is the silence from my colleagues
across the aisle.
Mr. Speaker, I wouldn’t bother seek-
ing an apology from him, but I do hope
Republicans here will join us in fully
and roundly condemning his words, and
I would remind them that history
won’t look kindly on those who refuse
to stand up for what is right.
It is not lost on me, however, and I
hope not my colleagues either, that
this is simply a distraction from the
President’s friendship with a docu-
mented pedophile and news reports
that he lied to the Supreme Court
about his census question.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, in
my district in northern Illinois, many
farmers are struggling with the chal-
lenges that come from a delayed plant-
ing season and an uncertain market.
But, recently, Kaylee Heap invited
me to her family’s farm to share her
story about yet another challenge:
healthcare costs.
Kaylee and her husband, Kevin, own
a pumpkin farm in Minooka, Illinois,
and Kaylee dreams of being able to
work on the farm to grow their busi-
ness.
Unfortunately, that is not an option
because health insurance is too expen-
sive for them to purchase on their
own—easily over $20,000 per year in my
district—so Kaylee works for an out-
side employer in order to afford health
insurance for their growing family.
Having to make the choice between
entrepreneurship and healthcare is un-
acceptable, and that is why I intro-
duced the Health Care Affordability
Act, H.R. 1868, to reduce insurance pre-
miums.
My bill would reduce premiums by
hundreds of thousands of dollars for ap-
proximately 20 million Americans,
39,000 of whom reside in my district.
A typical Illinois family like
Kaylee’s would see their premiums cut
in half, saving over $750 per month—
and that is real money.

HONORING WOMEN’S U.S. NA-
TIONAL SOCCER TEAM GOAL-
KEEPER, ALYSSA NAEHER
(Ms. DELAURO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
honor Alyssa Naeher, the Connecticut-
born U.S. Women’s National Soccer
Team goalkeeper.
The United States team once again
proved that they are the best in the
world. And throughout the World Cup,
Alyssa—who grew up in Stratford, Con-
necticut, in my district, and played at
Christian Heritage School in Trum-
bull—provided crucial play after cru-
cial play. None was more important or
heart-stopping than her save against
England.
By stopping a penalty kick with time
winding down, she single-handedly
saved the United States’ championship
hopes.
And Alyssa is more than just a cham-
pion. She is a role model as the team
champions the issue of equal pay for
them and for millions of women and
families nationwide.
Clearly, the time is now for the
United States Senate to pass H.R. 7,
the Paycheck Fairness Act, which has
said men and women in the same job
deserve the same pay.
What better tribute, my friends, to
the talent, to the determination, and
to the commitment of these out-
standing young women.
Mr. Speaker, again, I congratulate
Alyssa. Connecticut could not be more
proud.

Intelligence. The rule self-executes a
manager’s amendment from Chairman
SCHIFF that makes technical and con-
forming changes and adds additional
language that authorizes the CIA to ex-
pand death benefits to cover officers
killed abroad. The rule makes in order
31 amendments and provides one mo-
tion to recommit.
Additionally, the rule provides for
consideration of House Report 116–125
and its accompanying resolution rec-
ommending that the House find Attor-
ney General Barr and Secretary Wilbur
Ross in contempt of Congress for refus-
ing to comply with congressional sub-
poenas under a closed rule.
The rule provides for 1 hour of debate

The rule provides for 1 hour of debate
equally divided and controlled by the

the Committee on the Judiciary.
Finally, included in this rule is a
process for consideration of com-
mittee-reported or Senate-passed joint
resolutions disapproving of certain
transactions under section 36 of the
Arms Export Control Act. This process
allows for the chair of the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee to call up such a joint
resolution 1 day after it is noticed by
the majority leader and provides 20
minutes or an hour of debate and a mo-
tion to recommit.
Mr. Speaker, the Intelligence Au-
thorization Act, H.R. 3494, authorizes
programs at 16 intelligence community
agencies and offices, including the Di-
rector of National Intelligence, the
CIA, the Department of Defense, the
DIA, the National Security Agency,
and the FBI.
This authorization prioritizes the in-
telligence community’s collection and
analytic capabilities against hard-tar-
get countries such as China, Russia,
Iran, and North Korea.
This bill will help us better under-
stand and counter Russian interference
in our elections. It requires reports to
Congress on the intentions and the de-
signs of Russian political leadership
with respect to potential military ac-
tion against NATO members and on the
most significant Russian influence
campaigns taking place around the
world.
This bill also creates a Climate Secu-
rity Advisory Council to ensure that
the intelligence community prioritizes
the threat of climate change. Specifi-
cally, the bill requires analysts to in-
corporate climate change into intel-
ligence analysis and encourages col-
laboration with executive branch de-
partments focused on climate policy.
Finally, this legislation takes care of
our intelligence community workers by
providing 12 weeks of paid parental
leave for all employees, in addition to
the 12 weeks of unpaid leave Federal
employees are allowed to take under
the Family and Medical Leave Act.
Mr. Speaker, on contempt, the Con-
stitution of the United States requires
us to conduct a Census every 10 years,
an actual enumeration of the American
people, everyone who is present in the
country.
Secretary Wilbur Ross engaged in a
process in order to add a citizenship
question to the Census for the first
time in 70 years.
This was struck down by multiple
Federal courts because of the blatant
violation of essentially every principle
of the Administrative Procedure Act.
They did not conduct notice and com-
ment; they did not assemble substan-
tial evidence; and they did not provide
a reasoned justification for why they
wanted to do this completely outside of
the process that had been set up under
the Census Act that had been running
for several years.
On June 27, the Supreme Court found
that the Commerce Department’s argu-
ment for including the citizenship
question in the 2020 Census was ‘‘con-
trived,’’ according to Chief Justice
John Roberts, who wrote: ‘‘Several
points, taken together, reveal a signifi-
cant mismatch between the Secretary’s
decision and the rationale he pro-
vided.’’
Democrats on the Oversight and Re-
form Committee have been raising
questions about Secretary Ross’ prof-
fered justification for several years
now. We started asking questions back
in 2017. Secretary Ross had testified
that the Department of Justice letter
that he received was the basis for
changing the policy and imposing a
citizenship question on the Census. He
said that this change was solely moti-
vated by the Department of Justice’s
request.
In fact, overwhelming evidence has
surfaced completely contradicting this
account. We know from multiple dif-
ferent sources now that this was a po-
litical effort designed to promote the
electoral plans of the GOP.
The gerrymandering mastermind of
the Republican Party, Thomas
Hofeller, was the one who first raised
this question several years ago. It was
talked about during the Trump cam-
paign. It was talked about within days
of the inauguration. We have substan-
tial evidence suggesting that Wilbur
Ross, as Secretary of Commerce, was
shopping around for a justification for
doing this when the motivations were
nakedly political.
The Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee began its investigation into the
administration’s decision to add the
citizenship question on March 27, 2018.
Yet, the majority of the committee has
been stonewalled at every turn by the
Departments of Justice and Commerce,
which have refused to turn over key
documents requested by the Oversight
and Reform Committee, even after the
committee, its members and staff, have
worked diligently to resolve the im-
passe by narrowing the scope of the re-
quest to a very small subset of docu-
ments.
We know exactly the documents we
need. Yet, still, we get nothing but de-
fiance, obstruction, and stonewalling
from this administration.
Democrats requested documents from
the Department of Commerce on April
4, 2018. None of the requested docu-
ments were submitted.
On January 8, 2019, Chairman CUM-
MINGS renewed the request, and the
Commerce Department responded by
providing thousands of pages of docu-
ments, most of which were already
publicly available or completely irrele-
vant, nonresponsive, or heavily re-
dacted.
On February 12, 2019, Chairman CUM-
MINGS renewed the request for docu-
ments again, this time identifying a
specific memo and note from the De-
partment of Commerce to the DOJ. The
DOJ did not provide the requested doc-
uments but, rather, produced several
other documents that were heavily re-
dacted and off point, and so on and so
forth.
Mr. Speaker, this is intolerable. The
Congress of the United States has a
constitutional duty to conduct a fair
Census.
Six former Census Bureau Directors
wrote a letter denouncing the imposi-
tion of this citizenship question and
telling Wilbur Ross that this would
lead to a far less accurate account. The
chief scientist of the Census Bureau
testified that this was going to over-
look and undercount as many as 6 mil-
lion Hispanic Americans. We know that
potentially millions of other Ameri-
cans too would not be counted.
The purpose of adding the citizenship
question was not to get a more accu-
rate count. It was to get a far more in-
accurate account. All the Census ex-
perts agree with that.
We have an act, the Census Act,
which was violated and ignored. We
have the Administrative Procedure
Act, which was violated and ignored.
Now we have issued a series of sub-
poena requests to the Departments of
Commerce and Justice in order to get
the information about what really took
place, and again, we are being defied,
ignored, and essentially belittled by
the executive branch of government.
Mr. Speaker, I want to close my re-
marks on this with this point. The
Constitution begins with the beautiful
phrase: ‘‘We, the people . . . in order to
form a more perfect union, establish
justice, ensure domestic tranquility,’’
and so on, do create this Constitution
in this country.
The very next sentence says that all
the legislative powers are vested in us.
In other words, the powers of the peo-
ple flow right through the preamble of
the Constitution into Article I.
The Supreme Court has repeatedly
said, along with other Federal courts,
that integral and essential to the law-
making function is the factfinding
function of Congress.
James Madison said, ‘‘Those who
mean to be their own governors must
arm themselves with the power that
knowledge gives.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5837
July 16, 2019
The people armed us with that power
by creating the legislative function in
Congress. But we can’t legislate and we
can’t govern if we can’t get the infor-
mation that we need, which is why the
Supreme Court has repeatedly empha-
sized our power is broad and it is ex-
pansive.
Our friends across the aisle, they
know that. They know that from their
Benghazi hearings that went on for
years and cost tens of millions of dol-
lars. They know that from the inquiry
into Hillary Clinton’s emails, and so
on.
Congress has the power to get the in-
formation that it wants.
Mr. Speaker, the Census is serious
business. It goes right to the heart of
who we are as ‘‘we, the people.’’
Every 10 years, the Founders told us
we have to go back and count every-
body up in order to conduct the re-
apportionment process and decide how
many Members of Congress are granted
to each State, and, then, hundreds of
billions of dollars follow in the wake of
the Census. So, we have to make sure
that every person is counted.
What we had was this rearguard,
sneak ambush attack on the Census.
They got caught doing it. The courts
blew the whistle. The Supreme Court
blew the whistle. But we want to know
precisely what happened to make sure
it doesn’t happen again, to make sure
that there has been no damage, and to
make sure we can go forward with a
real Census.
If you act with contempt of the Con-
gress, if you act with contempt for the
Congress, if you act with contempt for
the American people, we will find you
in contempt of Congress and the Amer-
ican people. We are given no choice.
Finally, Mr. Speaker, on the resolu-
tion condemning the President’s recent
remarks, the President of the United
States told four Americans who are
Members of Congress to ‘‘go back’’ to
the countries they came from. Three of
them, Representatives AYANNA
PRESSLEY, RASHIDA TLAIB, and ALEXAN-
DRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, are native-born
Americans, and one of them, Rep-
resentative ILHAN OMAR, was born
abroad.
Mr. Speaker, this is an affront, not
just of four American citizens who are
Members of Congress. It is an affront
to 22 million naturalized American
citizens who were born in another
country and made the journey to
America and made the journey to be-
coming full-blown, equal, and free
American citizens, 22 million American
citizens.
b 1245
Indeed, if you think about it, it is an
affront to the hundreds of millions of
Americans who understand and love
how American democracy and citizen-
ship work. We are not a nation defined
by race and blood as the neo-Nazis and
Klansman chanted in Charlottesville as
they marched down the street terror-
izing the people of Charlottesville. We
are defined by our Constitution, which
belongs to all of us, and we are defined
by the patriotism and by the service of
our people.
Is there something wrong with being
a naturalized citizen under our Con-
stitution, Mr. Speaker? No, there is
not. This is something to be honored
and celebrated.
All Americans are equal in the eyes
of the law. This is the meaning of the
Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Pro-
tection Clause. We have no kings here.
We have no queens here. We have no ti-
tles of nobility. We have no monarchy.
We have no taints of blood. We have no
hereditary offenses. We have no racial
caste system. We have no slaves, and
we have no slave masters.
It is true that there are those in our
history who have wanted America to be
defined as a White man’s compact, and
that is, indeed, precisely what the Su-
preme Court found it was in the infa-
mous Dred Scott decision in 1857.
President Lincoln, a great and glo-
rious Republican President, rejected
the Dred Scott decision from the begin-
ning as the product of a racist ideology
and a racist political conspiracy, and it
took a Civil War, the blood and the sac-
rifice of hundreds of thousands of
Americans, to defend the Union and to
guarantee the passage of the 13th, 14th,
and 15th Amendments to overthrow
and destroy the Dred Scott decision
and the poisonous idea that America is
a White man’s compact. It is not.
All persons born in the United States
are citizens of the United States, we
said, in the 14th Amendment, which
guaranteed equal protection of the law
to all persons who are here. All of us
are equal, whether you are a natural-
ized citizen who was born in Ireland, as
our colleague Congressman SEAN
CASTEN was; or in Ecuador, as our col-
league DEBBIE MUCARSEL-POWELL was;
or in Mexico, as our colleague CHUY
GARCIA was; or in France, as our good
friend and colleague MARK MEADOWS
was; or Thailand, as our colleague
TAMMY DUCKWORTH was; or in Guate-
mala, as our colleague NORMA TORRES
was; or in Taiwan, as our colleague TED
LIEU was; or in Canada, as our col-
league TED CRUZ was; or in Poland, as
our colleague and author of this resolu-
tion, TOM MALINOWSKI, was.
If these Americans and many more
like them—we have 29 foreign-born
Members of Congress. If these Ameri-
cans and many more like them don’t
belong in Congress, tell it to the mil-
lions of people who elected them, and
tell it to the Founders of our country
who specifically said that you can run
for the House of Representatives if you
are a naturalized citizen if you have
been naturalized for 7 years, or you can
run for the Senate of the United States
if you are a naturalized citizen if you
have been naturalized for 9 years.
Mr. Speaker, to tell naturalized
American citizens to go back to the
countries they came from is nativist
and antithetical to everything that
America stands for. It is the opposite
of what we believe about the values of
the country.
To tell native-born American citizens
who are people of color to go back to
the country they came from is anti-
thetical to everything we stand for,
and it will be up to the House of Rep-
resentatives today to determine wheth-
er or not that is a racist statement.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I don’t want to put any pressure on
you, Mr. Speaker, but it comforts me
to see you as the Chair up there today.
There are those days where you need
particular leaders to be there at a par-
ticular time, and I will tell you that I
am not telling anybody in this Cham-
ber anything they don’t already know:
You have made an entire career in this
institution reaching out, building un-
likely alliances, making it work where
other folks said it could not work. And
when my friend from Maryland, whom
I thank for yielding me the customary
30 minutes, talks about what it is our
constituents expect, what it is our citi-
zenry expects, I think they expect that,
Mr. Speaker, and we have one of those
bills before us today in the intelligence
reauthorization act.
There is more in this rule, Mr.
Speaker, than I believe I have seen in
any rule in my 9 years in Congress and
years serving on staff here. We packed
it all in there last night, and I don’t
want to miss the lead on this rule,
which is an intelligence bill that is
named after two congressional staffers
who passed away last year. They spent
their lives in service to this institution
and to the intelligence community, and
we are grateful for that service.
If you have not looked at the intel-
ligence community recently, Mr.
Speaker, you will see DEVIN NUNES on
the Republican side of the aisle and
ADAM SCHIFF leading it on the Demo-
cratic side of the aisle. I can picture
those two faces because I usually see
them on split screens on FOX or
MSNBC, and I can’t think of many
things they have had to say where they
agreed with one another over the past
4, 5 years, and yet we have a bill today
in sharp contrast to the partisan non-
sense that was the NDAA operation
last week.
We have a bill that has come out of
the Intelligence Committee with two
strident, passionate Republican and
Democratic leaders there on the Intel-
ligence Committee, that came out
unanimously, that they presented
unanimously in front of the Rules
Committee last night and we have a
chance to pass here on the floor of the
House.
You also find in this rule, Mr. Speak-
er, 31 amendments that have been
made in order to that intelligence re-
authorization bill. Even though we
found bipartisanship in the committee,
even though we found unanimity in the
committee, the Rules Committee, in
its wisdom, last night, decided to make
31 more ideas available to be consid-
ered here on the floor of the House.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5838 July 16, 2019
You see in this rule, Mr. Speaker, the
ability for the House to take up Arms
Export Control Act measures. These
are also measures you are going to find
bipartisan support for, also measures
that you will find, again, as my friend
from Maryland referenced, the House
doing what you would expect the House
to do, what our bosses back home sent
us here to do.
I know, Mr. Speaker, that there are
times when folks feel their deeply held
beliefs cannot be compromised for the
sake of bipartisanship. I find that try-
ing to find a way to get to yes is better
than trying to find a way to get to no.
There is always a reason to get to no.
Instead of looking for ways to oppose
our political rivals, we have to act as
the Intelligence Committee did, in a
manner where we can find issues on
which we agree. It is the only way to
move this process forward.
Mr. Speaker, America’s national se-
curity and that of our allies, which is
what the intelligence community helps
to protect and support every day, is
about more than scoring political
points.
I mentioned those split screens on
the TV where you do see folks lobbing
accusations back and forth. Sometimes
it seems to be political sport instead of
serious legislating.
The measure we have before us today
is not political sport; it is serious legis-
lating. And we are going to have a
chance to come together as a House
not just to discuss it, not just to im-
prove it, but to implement it.
Mr. Speaker, among the things that
you will find in this bill, the foreign in-
fluences around the globe, and we have
talked about them in all of their var-
ious incarnations here on the floor of
the House over the last 2 weeks. This
bill requires a report on China’s influ-
ence over Taiwanese elections.
Chinese influence around the globe is
at an unparalleled high. We are now ri-
valed by the Chinese in every single as-
pect of international influence and pol-
icy, but they have outsized influence in
Taiwan, and we require that report.
We require a report not just on Rus-
sian interference in our elections, Mr.
Speaker, but in elections across the
globe. It would be naive to suggest that
the Russians would limit their influ-
ence in elections to trying to manipu-
late the greatest and freest country in
the world. They are working across the
globe to influence elections wherever
free people live.
Combating Chinese and Russian ag-
gression in elections, Mr. Speaker, is
not something, as is so often told in
the media, that divides us; it is some-
thing that unites us. We saw that in
the Intelligence Committee, and we are
going to see that here on the floor of
the House, and I am very proud of that.
I wish we could have continued that ef-
fort, Mr. Speaker.
I agree with every word my friend
from Maryland said about standing up
for Article I. Of all of my frustrations
of 9 years in this institution, the def-
erence of the United States Congress to
the executive branch has been my
greatest frustration. It exists for one
reason and one reason only, and that is
that men and women, colleagues like
my friend from Maryland and I, have
been unable to find a way to speak
with one voice on issues that are Arti-
cle I versus Article II issues.
Go down the list in your time in Con-
gress, Mr. Speaker, whether it is the
contempt resolution this institution
passed for former Attorney General
Eric Holder, that contempt resolution
that passed on party-line votes in com-
mittee and party-line votes here on the
floor of the House and went down to
the executive branch where absolutely
no action was taken on it whatsoever;
take production of papers, whether on
Fast and Furious or whether on the
Census, production of papers, whether
from the President’s counsel or from
the President’s press secretary, we
have these discussions and we cannot—
no, we have not found a way to come
together to speak with one voice.
We have an opportunity, a model.
You will remember some number of
weeks ago—now, months ago, Mr.
Speaker—where we were very con-
cerned in this Chamber about anti-Se-
mitic remarks that were broadcast in
the public domain. We came together
as an institution to speak out against
anti-Semitism.
It didn’t happen overnight. In fact,
my friend from Maryland authored
that resolution, to his credit. But he
didn’t sit down with a pen and put
some words on a page and bring it here
to the floor for consideration. He had
to work it. And I don’t mean work it a
little bit; I mean work it hard: it was
coming; it was not coming; it was com-
ing again; it was not coming. To find a
pathway forward so that this House
speaks with one voice instead of di-
vided voices was an effort that was put
in.
Now, granted, at the end of the day,
it was a little more milquetoast than
the resolution that I would have draft-
ed, but sometimes that is the trade you
make to be able to expand the accept-
ance of a resolution, Mr. Speaker.
Every single time in this Chamber, as
it comes to reining in Article II or
reining in the judicial branch, every
single time we speak with a divided
voice, we weaken this institution.
I have never seen a resolution that
tried to hold two Cabinet Secretaries
in contempt at the same time. Maybe
that has happened historically; I don’t
know that answer. I have not seen it in
my time.
I heard last night from the chairman
of the House Oversight Committee and
the ranking member of the House Over-
sight Committee, and the ranking
member was unwavering in his com-
mitment to Article I and our pre-
eminence in the constitutional model.
But he was also unwavering in his com-
mitment to there is more that we could
do to work with the administration as
opposed to begin to poke that sharp
stick, and so this resolution does not
have his support.
Well, if we begin our effort to do
oversight over the administration and
we are already divided before that bill
even leaves committee, I tell you, Mr.
Speaker, we are not going to have the
outcome that we want here on the floor
of the House.
And then, of course, this rule in those
contempt efforts is targeting a United
States citizenship question that would
have gone on the Census. We talk
about that as if that is an outrageous
thing.
I appreciate the kind words my friend
from Maryland had to say about Presi-
dent Lincoln. I am going to have to get
the Clerk to read them back to me be-
cause I am going to use that over and
over again about a wonderful Repub-
lican President, but I want to use the
words that Mr. RASKIN used.
But when President Lincoln was pre-
siding over this land, it was common
practice to have a citizenship question
on the United States Census.
b 1300
In fact, every single Census from 1820
to 1950 had a citizenship question on it.
It was noncontroversial. In 1950, we
took it off of the short form; it moved
to the long form. And so from 1970 to
2000, that question was on the long
form every single Census. And then in
2000, we took it off the long form and
we put it onto the American Commu-
nity Survey, that half-decade measure
that goes out to create the data that
Mr. RASKIN rightly noted is so impor-
tant to all of our communities back
home.
If, for the first time in American his-
tory, in the history of the Census, we
decide that citizenship is somehow now
a forbidden topic, that we can’t find a
way to discuss it, that it is not impor-
tant to who we are as a Nation and how
it is that we look at ourselves, fair
enough.
That is not what the Supreme Court
case was about, Mr. Speaker. As we
well know, the Supreme Court case
simply said: You can put a question
about citizenship on the Census if you
want to. You just didn’t do it the right
way, and so we are going to ask you
not to do it that way. There are those
ways and means of getting that done.
You just didn’t do it the right way.
I raise that, Mr. Speaker, not because
I am a Census guru. I am not. I don’t
serve on any of those relevant commit-
tees. But in this era of outrage, where
folks have begun to confuse civility
with weakness—and that is a confusion
that I think is to all of our det-
riments—the desire to have a question
about citizenship on the Census has
nothing to do with this President, this
administration, Republicans, Demo-
crats. It has been that way since 1820.
Thoughtful men and women, con-
cerned men and women, serious legisla-
tors have been interested in this infor-
mation for over 100 years.
If we want to have the conversation
that somehow citizenship can’t be dis-
cussed anymore and we should ban it

from all Census documentation forever,
I don’t think that would succeed, but it
is certainly a legitimate topic of de-
bate. But what is not legitimate is to
suggest that the only reason that any-
one would ask about citizenship is to
pursue some sort of nefarious,
xenophobic purpose. It is simply not
true.
I represent a majority minority con-
stituency, Mr. Speaker. Twenty-six
percent of my bosses are first-genera-
tion Americans. You want to find folks
who love America, come down to where
I live, find folks who have waited in
line, folks who have paid their money,
folks who pinned all their hopes and
dreams to, ‘‘If and only if I can get
there, my children and my grand-
children will have a better life.’’
That is what brought us all here at
one generation or another. Whether
you came in 1650 or whether you came
in 1950 or whether you came yesterday,
those are the dreams that bring us
here.
There is a lot to be outraged about in
today’s culture, but I haven’t seen any
of it get fixed by being more outraged.
I have seen it get fixed by men and
women like yourself, Mr. Speaker, who
value trust, who value candor, who
value honesty, and who value real rela-
tionships.
Anything that is hard, I can’t solve
with someone I don’t trust. If one side
is good and one side is evil, where do
you go from there? What does that ne-
gotiation look like? That is not a con-
versation; that is you have got to now
destroy one another. That seems to be
the path that folks too often opt for in
politics today.
There is more that unites us than di-
vides us in this constitution and in this
country, Mr. Speaker. You might not
know that by the parts of this rule that
are going to get the most attention
today.
ADAM SCHIFF, DEVIN NUNES, there are
not two Members in this institution
who feel more strongly and differently
about the direction of public policy
than those two men, and they came to-
gether, not to advance themselves, but
to advance the Nation. They came to-
gether, not because it was easy, but
precisely because it was hard and nec-
essary, and brought us this bipartisan
package we have today.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from
Massachusetts, the chairman of the
Rules Committee, for bringing that
resolution to the floor, and I hope we
will have ample time to celebrate those
successes.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I might consume.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman
from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL) for his
very thoughtful and moving remarks,
which are very appealing to me, espe-
cially since I am a law professor first
and only a politician thereafter.
And, you know, we all have to deal
with the political party system as it
exists in the America of today, but I
like to think of the Presidents who
kept a kind of dual mind about it. They
knew that they had to be part of it in
order to operate, as all of us do, but
also to try to think about the broader
whole.
You know, Jefferson in his first inau-
gural address in 1800 said that we are
all Republicans, we are all Federalists.
And he also said:
If I could only go to heaven with a political
party, I would prefer not to go.
George Washington said to us:
We have to keep in mind that the word
party comes from the French word partie, a
part, and when we govern, we should try to
keep in mind the whole.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman
for at least the one cheer of a potential
three hip hip hoorays you might have
given us on the Intelligence Authoriza-
tion Act.
We do think that the contempt cita-
tion is necessary precisely for the rea-
son you suggest: to uphold the institu-
tional integrity of Congress.
We have gotten together in the past
across party lines to demand that the
executive branch gives us the informa-
tion we need, and we believe that we
are completely on that course.
Finally, as to the resolution about
the remarks telling U.S. citizens to go
back to the country they came from; it
is hard for me not to see something
that could be more unifying than that;
that it is an essential value that I
know every Member of this body holds,
that we do not make a distinction in
the legal or political rights or entitle-
ments or responsibilities of natural-
born citizens and naturalized citizens,
and that it is utterly offensive to our
system of government to tell people to
go back to where they came from just
because you have a political disagree-
ment with them. It is wrong.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.
MCGOVERN), the chair of the Rules
Committee.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want
to thank the gentleman from Maryland
(Mr. RASKIN) for yielding me the time
and I want to thank him for his service
on the Rules Committee.
Mr. Speaker, I certainly support the
rule, but I want to speak on one under-
lying bill in particular, H. Res. 489.
Mr. Speaker, what we saw this week
used to be reserved for the darkest cor-
ners of the internet, some chat room
somewhere where people would be too
ashamed to even use their real name
when spewing vile rhetoric.
But this isn’t some online troll. We
are not talking about using dog whis-
tles or speaking in some kind of secret
alt-right code, Mr. Speaker.
This is proudly using Twitter as a
megaphone to attack fellow Ameri-
cans.
These are American citizens being
turned into some kind of scary
‘‘other,’’ not because of their party, but
because of their background, their
race, and their opinions. This is the
same type of attack the President has
used against immigrants and refugees
for years.
I have seen this administration carry
out some deeply troubling policies. I
have heard some deeply offensive
things. And I know I am not alone in
this, because when the cameras are off
and the press isn’t around, some of my
colleagues on the other side have told
me the same thing, that they are
sickened by what is going on.
Well, these recent comments are in a
completely different category. This
type of language isn’t just offensive. It
could lead to violence. It is corroding
our discourse. It undermines our val-
ues, and it doesn’t reflect who we are
as a country.
Mr. Speaker, let me tell my Repub-
lican colleagues on the other side of
the aisle, more sternly worded press re-
leases and disappointed tweets aren’t
going to cut it. The only thing that
matters here is votes. Press statements
are not enough.
This House needs to speak with unity
and vote to condemn the President’s
comments for what they are.
Now, I believe in the adage from
Maya Angelou: ‘‘When someone shows
you who they are, believe them.’’
The President told us who he was
long before he rode that escalator down
to announce his campaign.
It is time Republicans told the Amer-
ican people with their votes what they
whisper to one another in the Cloak-
room, what many of them have told me
behind closed doors, because this dark
world view is what will be on the bal-
lot.
Mr. Speaker, I implore my colleagues
to think twice before they follow the
President off a cliff. Our credibility
matters and their credibility matters.
A Presidency lasts, at most, just 4 to
8 years. Some of us will get the chance
to serve here long after this adminis-
tration ends, and we will have to live
with our conscience for a lifetime, but
silence is an endorsement, equivo-
cation is an endorsement, blaming both
sides is an endorsement.
There is no gray area here. There is a
very clear right and wrong. So sup-
porting this resolution isn’t about
standing with Democrats; it is about
standing up for decency.
The President showed us who he is.
Now we have the chance to show the
American people who we are.
Now, it is no secret that I have pro-
found policy disagreements with this
President. His economic policies favor
the rich and his foreign policy com-
pletely ignores human rights, but in all
the time I have been alive, I have al-
ways respected the office of the Presi-
dent and the occupant.
I feel differently now. I feel embar-
rassed. I feel ashamed.
Mr. Speaker, let me remind my col-
leagues, our children are watching us.
So do the right thing. Do the moral
thing. Condemn President Trump’s
hateful and blatantly racist rhetoric.
And I don’t care if it is out of order,
but we need to be clear, we need to call

it what it is, and we need to condemn
it.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I might consume.
Mr. Speaker, I think I misunderstood
my friend from Massachusetts. I think
what my friend said is he does not care
whether his words coarsen this institu-
tion, he does not care whether or not
his positions diminish us as an institu-
tion, he does not care about the rules
of this institution, which prohibit ex-
actly the kind of words that he knows
they prohibit and yet he uses anyway.
Mr. Speaker, I just want to ask my
friend if he believes that his cause of
admonishing this President is going to
be advantaged by diminishing this in-
stitution?
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN).
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I believe that what I am
saying on the House floor supports the
truth. I believe every word I said, and
I feel strongly about it. I would only
wish my colleagues on the other side
would feel equally strong about con-
demning these horrific remarks.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, re-
claiming my time. If the President be-
lieves every word that he said, does
that excuse his behavior, in the gentle-
man’s mind? Does it excuse his behav-
ior to believe it?
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the
President can say whatever he wants. I
think we have a moral obligation to
call out racism wherever it exists.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, re-
claiming my time. It is a perfectly le-
gitimate assertion and attestation my
friend from Massachusetts makes, and
of course we all share that belief.
Mr. Speaker, when I was down here
for the rule last week with my friend
from Massachusetts, the other side was
admonished, not once, but twice for
violating the House rules for coars-
ening our debate, for diminishing our
civility, for violating our rules; not a
social contract about how we ought to
treat each other, but rules where we
have committed about how we will
treat each other.
Today during 1 minute speeches, Mr.
Speaker, not once, but twice the Chair
admonished the other side to say: You
are breaking our rules of civility. You
are violating our standards of decorum.
Our children are watching, and your
behavior doesn’t pass muster.
And now my friend—and he is my
friend and I admire his work—he is pas-
sionate in the causes for which he ad-
vocates, and I believe that it is his pas-
sion, not his contempt for this institu-
tion, that leads him to say those things
that he says. I believe he loves this in-
stitution, but he is misguided, when
the Chair admonishes him again today
now, and he has no apologies for his
colleagues, no apologies for this insti-
tution.
We do have serious issues. I am not
meaning serious like Russia and China,
which those are serious, I don’t mean
serious like the hate that is fomenting
in this country, which is serious. I
mean all of it that is serious that no-
body in this institution can solve un-
less we solve it together, and I want to
find that pathway forward. This isn’t
it.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, the
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.
MCGOVERN).
b 1315
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ap-
preciate the gentleman’s comments,
but I would ask him: Where was he
when President Trump was spreading
lies about President Obama’s birth?
Where was he when Representative JOE
WILSON shouted, on the House floor,
‘‘You lie,’’ to President Obama in 2009?
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, re-
claiming my time.
Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman re-
member when JOE WILSON apologized,
which is more than what my friend
from Massachusetts has done when the
House has condemned him from the
Chair today?
I remember when my friend Mr. WIL-
SON lost his temper. I do remember it.
And I remember him apologizing for it
because he didn’t want to bring shame
on this institution.
I would welcome any time the Chair
admonishes either side of the aisle for
violating our rules, coarsening our de-
bate, doing those things that we all
agree we don’t want our children to see
on TV, I welcome folks to correct that
behavior.
Mr. Speaker, I fear my comments are
falling on deaf ears, but I hope I am
mistaken.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, before I
go into my time, may I make a par-
liamentary inquiry?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, do we
take it to be against the rules of the
House to describe statements made by
the President as racist as a violation of
House rules?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair will not issue an advisory opin-
ion.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, launching
into my time, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON
LEE).
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Maryland
for his scholarship and his passion, the
chairman of the Rules Committee, my
good friend from Georgia, and all those
who have come to the floor today.
Mr. Speaker, let me say that this is
a somber moment. It is not a moment
that I cherish. My privilege in serving
the greatest country in the world has
allowed me to serve with three pre-
vious Presidents. Not one time from
the three previous Presidents have I
ever heard the words that were uttered
this weekend.
I believe in harmony. I just came out
of a Helsinki Commission meeting, an
organization that deals with peace
around the world. We were talking
about how we can impress upon the
world to not use religion for hatred.
Religion is love.
One of the answers I gave was to
show the examples here in the United
States, where religions from all dif-
ferent perspectives come together in a
time of disaster and need. It is some-
thing that touches our heart.
When we vote for a President, we
want that President to touch our
hearts, to lift us up, and to make us
better people.
I cannot argue with the fact that 49
percent of the American people believe
that this President is a racist. It hurts
my heart because I come in a skin
color where I have been at the sad end
of racist tactics and words. I am a
product of busing. But it does not di-
minish my love for this Nation.
So it disturbs me for this wonderfully
diverse group of new Members who
have come to the United States Con-
gress from all over the Nation, includ-
ing the LGBTQ community, and among
the 40 Representatives who came was
the Representative from the Seventh
Congressional District of Massachu-
setts, the State’s first African Amer-
ican woman; the Representative of the
13th Congressional District of Michi-
gan, the first Palestinian woman; the
Representative from the 14th Congres-
sional District of New York, the young-
est woman; and the Representative
from the Fifth Congressional District
of Minnesota, the first Somali Amer-
ican elected to Congress.
In the discharge of their duties, they
went to the border—their passion, their
youth, just as I had done—and saw the
appalling conditions that children were
held in. They came back and expressed
themselves, protected by the First
Amendment.
They used no violence. They only
wanted to wake up the Congress, as all
of us who went and could not accept
the pain did. In fact, wherever I go at
home, people are asking: What are you
doing for the children at the border?
So, they didn’t do anything extraor-
dinary, in terms of what Members
should do, having the responsibility of
oversight.
Then came, in the last 72 hours, these
words: ‘‘So interesting to see ‘progres-
sive’ Democrat Congresswomen, who
originally came from countries whose
governments are a complete and total
catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt,
and inept anywhere in the world, if
they even have a functioning govern-
ment at all, now loudly and viciously

telling the people of the United States,
the greatest and most powerful nation
on Earth, how our government is to be
run.’’
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from Texas.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. ‘‘Why don’t they
go back and help fix the totally broken
and crime-infested places from which
they came?’’
I will be introducing a condemnation
resolution that recounts the life and
legacy of this President while 49 per-
cent of the people believe that he is
racist.
I only ask that we come together
today to do the right thing, to do what
the 16th President said right after the
Civil War: ‘‘We are not enemies, but
friends. We must not be enemies.
Though passion may have strained, it
must not break our bonds of affection.
The mystic chords of memory’’ will
swell when again touched, ‘‘as surely
they will be, by the better angels of our
nature.’’
Today, if we condemn this language,
it will say to America that we cannot
accept this kind of behavior. That is
what is bringing the country together,
that we accept each other’s diversity.
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the
Committees on the Judiciary and Homeland
Security, I rise in support of the rule governing
debate on H. Res. 489, a resolution con-
demning President Trump’s racist comments
directed at Members of Congress.
Mr. Speaker, on November 6, 2018, in an
election widely regarded as a referendum on
the performance and disapproval of the Ad-
ministration of President Donald J. Trump, the
American people voted to vest control of the
U.S. House of Representatives in the Demo-
cratic Party to restore the system of checks
and balances designed by the Framers in
1787 in Philadelphia.
The Representatives elected to the 116th
Congress comprise the most diverse class in
American history with respect to its racial, eth-
nic, and religious composition, and also in-
cludes the largest contingent of female Rep-
resentatives and the most members ever of
the LGBTQ community.
Among the cohort of the 40 Representatives
first elected to the Congress in the November
2018 election are several whose membership
is historic, including the Representative for the
Seventh District of Massachusetts, the first Af-
rican American woman elected from the Com-
monwealth of Massachusetts; the Representa-
tive from the Thirteenth District of Michigan,
the first Palestinian-American woman elected
to Congress; the Representative from the
Fourteenth District of New York, the youngest
woman ever elected to Congress; and the
Representative from the Fifth District of Min-
nesota, the first Somali-American elected to
Congress.
In the discharge of their official duties as
Members of Congress, these talented and
dedicated Members of Congress traveled to
the southern border of the United States to
observe the living conditions and treatment re-
ceived by migrants and refugees seeking asy-
lum in the United States who are currently
being held in detention facilities operated
under control or supervision of the U.S. Cus-
toms and Border Protection (CBP), some con-
sisting of nothing more than tent villages
cordoned off under highways.
Upon their return to the Capitol, these Mem-
bers of Congress reported their shock and
horror regarding the appalling and inhumane
conditions to which detainees were being sub-
jected by CPB at a public hearing of a House
Committee on Oversight and Reform.
On July 14, 2019, the President of the
United States reacted to the criticism of his
Administration’s treatment of detainees by
these Members of Congress in a series of un-
hinged tweets that questioned their loyalty to
the United States and implied that due to the
circumstances of their birth they had no right
to exercise the responsibilities and privileges
of duly elected Members of Congress.
Specifically, the President tweeted that it
was:
So interesting to see ‘‘Progressive’’ Demo-
crat Congresswomen, who originally came
from countries whose governments are a
complete and total catastrophe, the worst,
most corrupt and inept anywhere in the
world (if they even have a functioning gov-
ernment at all), now loudly . . . and vi-
ciously telling the people of the United
States, the greatest and most powerful Na-
tion on earth, how our government is to be
run. Why don’t they go back and help fix the
totally broken and crime infested places
from which they came.
The President’s statements are false in that
three of Members of Congress he impugned
are in fact natural born citizens and the fourth
is a naturalized citizen.
Although the recent statements of the Presi-
dent are inaccurate and offensive, they are
consistent with prior statements he has made
to stoke to division, discord, and disharmony
among the American people.
Let us not forget that the current President
of the United States burnished his political
reputation by claiming falsely for more than 5
years that his predecessor was born in Kenya
and not in the United States and thus was an
illegitimate President.
The current President of the United States
launched his 2016 campaign for the Presi-
dency by saying of persons from Mexico seek-
ing to immigrate to the United States: ‘‘They’re
bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re
rapists.’’
The current President of the United States
claimed that a Hispanic federal jurist could not
preside over a court proceeding to which then
presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and
the Trump Organization were defendants ac-
cused of civil fraud because ‘‘He’s a Mexican!’’
In January 2018 the current President of the
United States is reported to have inquired of
his advisors: ‘‘Why are we having all these
people from (expletive deleted) countries
come here?’’, referring to persons from coun-
tries in Africa, the Caribbean, and Central and
South America.
And most contemptible of all, on August 15,
2017 the current President of the United
States said he regarded as some ‘‘very fine
people,’’ the neo-Nazis, white supremacists,
and Ku Klux Klansmen who descended on the
peaceful community of Charlottesville, Virginia
to advocate racism and who were met by
peaceful counterprotestors in a clash that the
white supremacists turned violent and resulted
in the death of Heather Heyer and left injured
many other innocent persons who were gath-
ered to affirm the principles of the Declaration
of Independence and the U.S. Constitution,
and to honor the sacrifice of unsung American
heroes who devoted their lives to the ongoing
quest to continue perfecting our union.
Mr. Speaker, the recent and past state-
ments and actions of the current President of
the United States demean the office he holds
and falls short of the standard set by the 16th
President, whose administration was devoted
to unity, healing, and ending racial division.
In his famous March 4, 1861, Inaugural Ad-
dress, President Abraham Lincoln foretold the
reasons why the efforts of the current Presi-
dent of the United States to rend our union
are destined to fail:
We are not enemies, but friends. We must
not be enemies. Though passion may have
strained, it must not break our bonds of af-
fection. The mystic chords of memory will
swell when again touched, as surely they will
be, by the better angels of our nature.
Before closing, Mr. Speaker, I think it appro-
priate to share my perspective on immigration
and significant and positive impact it has in
the development of this, the greatest nation in
human history.
Like the Framers did in the summer of
1776, it is fitting that we gather in the nation’s
capital on a sweltering July day to reflect upon
America’s long and continuing struggle for jus-
tice, equality, and opportunity.
After all, all that any of us wants is an hon-
ored place in the American family.
I am often reminded that as I speak there is
a family somewhere about to begin a dan-
gerous but hopeful quest.
Somewhere south of the border, maybe
across the Rio Grande from El Paso, Laredo,
Corpus Christi, or Brownsville or maybe just
south of Tucson or San Diego or Douglass,
Arizona.
Somewhere there is a family in the Old
Country anxiously about to embark on their
own journey to the New World of America.
They come for the same reason so many
millions came before them, in this century and
last, from this continent and from every other.
They come for the same reason families
have always come to America: to be free of
fear and hunger, to better their condition, to
begin their world anew, to give their children
a chance for a better life.
Like previous waves of immigrants, they too
will wage all and risk all to reach the side-
walks of Houston or Los Angeles or Phoenix
or Chicago or Atlanta or Denver or Detroit.
They will risk death in the desert; they will
brave the elements, they will risk capture and
crime, they will endure separation from loved
ones.
And if they make it to the Promised Land of
America, no job will be beneath them.
They will cook our food, clean our houses,
cut our grass, and care for our kids.
They will be cheated by some and exploited
by others.
They work in sunlight but live in twilight, be-
tween the shadows; not fully welcome as new
Americans but wanted as low-wage workers.
Somewhere near the borders tonight, a fam-
ily will cross over into the New World, willed
by the enduring power of the American
Dream.
I urge all Members to join me in supporting
H. Res. 489.
All American should take pride in and cele-
brate the ethnic, racial, and religious diversity

that has made the United States the leader of
the community of nations and the beacon of
hope and inspiration to oppressed persons ev-
erywhere.
And in addition to the love and pride Ameri-
cans justifiably have for their country, all per-
sons in the United States should cherish and
exercise the rights, privileges, and responsibil-
ities guaranteed by the Constitution of the
United States.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are again reminded to refrain from
engaging in personalities toward the
President.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
While my friend from Texas is some-
times known for running over the gavel
at the end of her comments, it is only
because it comes from the heart. When
I think about Members in this institu-
tion who are unhampered by a lack of
passion, I think of my friend from
Texas. But when I look for an honest
broker, who will be true to her word
and partner when partnership is re-
quired, my friend from Texas embodies
that, as well. I appreciate both her
words and her restraint here this morn-
ing.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gen-
tleman yield?
Mr. WOODALL. I yield to the gentle-
woman from Texas.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker,
there is no doubt that my faith, my
commitment to many people of dif-
ferent colors who respect the distinc-
tion or difference but also the great-
ness of this country, my love of those
who serve, causes me to say, as many
of my colleagues here are ready to say:
Let us sit down at the table of peace
and reconciliation.
I hope we will have some who will ac-
knowledge that these actions—I will
try to be generic—and words were cer-
tainly not becoming of the United
States of America. The American peo-
ple must see us work together on that.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, re-
claiming my time, I thank my friend
from Texas. I think that is a welcome
invitation.
Mr. Speaker, thinking about the poli-
cies before us today, if we defeat the
previous question, I will amend the
rule to bring H.R. 3965 to the floor.
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD immediately pre-
ceding the vote on the previous ques-
tion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia?
There was no objection.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, you
have heard a lot about the controver-
sial citizenship question in the Census.
Whether or not it should be controver-
sial is a different issue altogether.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
4 minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. COMER).
Mr. COMER. Today, I introduce the
Citizens Count Census Act of 2019, a
bill that would require a citizenship
question on the United States Census.
If we defeat the previous question, as
the gentleman from Georgia said, then
we will be able to consider my bill.
It has always been common sense to
include a citizenship question on our
Nation’s Census. The purpose of the
Census Bureau and all Census surveys
is to include data used for apportion-
ment and to better inform the public
about the population, business, and ec-
onomics of the United States of Amer-
ica.
The collection of citizenship informa-
tion during a population census is a
common practice among countries.
This is not new, and it should not be
controversial. A citizenship question is
asked on the census in Australia, Can-
ada, France, Germany, Ireland, Mexico,
and the United Kingdom, to name a
few. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the United
Nations recommends that countries
gather citizenship information about
their populations.
Knowing how many legal and
nonlegal individuals are within our
borders is a perfectly appropriate ques-
tion to ask on our Census, and I hope
we can pass this measure to see that
happen.
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all of
my congressional colleagues to vote for
this commonsense legislation to ensure
we know exactly how many citizens re-
side in this country.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I continue
to reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, may I
ask how much time is remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 71⁄2 minutes
remaining. The gentleman from Mary-
land has 21⁄2 minutes remaining.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
4 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio
(Mr. JORDAN), my good friend and the
ranking member on the House Over-
sight and Reform Committee.
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, the Department of Com-
merce and the Department of Justice
have given 31,000 pages of documents to
the Congress. They provided witnesses.
In fact, we have another one coming in
for a transcribed interview later this
month.
Secretary Ross came and testified for
over 6 hours. He came in front of the
committee, raised his hand, swore to
tell the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help him God.
He testified for 6 hours.
Secretary Ross and Attorney General
Barr are doing their jobs. What is their
reward? The Democrats are going to
hold them in contempt, hold them in
contempt because they are so focused
on this citizenship question.
As Mr. COMER, who has introduced
legislation, said just a few minutes
ago, the citizenship question is nothing
but common sense.
Listen to what Justice Alito said 2
weeks ago, ‘‘No one disputes that it is
important to know how many inhab-
itants of this country are citizens.’’
And the easiest way to figure it out is
to ask a question on the Census.
That is about as common sense as it
gets. It is so common sense, we have
only been doing it for 200 years, in one
form or another. The long form, the
short form, the 10-year form, the an-
nual form, we have been doing it for 200
years.
But somehow, this year: No, you
can’t do it this year. You can’t do it
this year.
As Mr. COMER said, the United Na-
tions says it is a best practice. Lots of
countries do it. But somehow, the
Democrats don’t want us to do it this
year.
I support the legislation that the
Representative from Kentucky has in-
troduced. I support the good work of
our Rules Committee member from
Georgia. Certainly, I don’t support the
rule and the resolution that is going to
hold Secretary Ross and Attorney Gen-
eral Barr in contempt. Again, doing
their job and what do they get? A con-
tempt resolution from the Democrats.
Ask yourself a question or, better
yet, go ask your constituents a ques-
tion. I would encourage Democrats to
go to their districts and ask anyone in
their districts: Do you think we should
ask a question on the Census about
whether you are a citizen of this coun-
try? My guess is just about every sin-
gle person you talk to in your district
will say: Heck, yeah, aren’t we doing
that already? Of course, my colleagues
would have to respond: Yes, we are, and
we have been doing it for 200 years.
This is common sense. This resolu-
tion is not appropriate.
Mr. Speaker, I urge defeat of the
rule, defeat of the previous question,
and if it gets to the floor, defeat of the
resolution.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, on the question of hold-
ing the Attorney General and Sec-
retary of Commerce in contempt for re-
fusing to turn over repeatedly re-
quested documents and witnesses, our
good friends now confuse two legal
questions with a policy question.
The legal question is: Did they vio-
late the law in imposing the citizenship
question on the Census? Yes, they did
violate the law. They violated the Cen-
sus Act. They violated the Administra-
tive Procedure Act. They violated pret-
ty much every administrative principle
we have in this country. Chief Justice
John Roberts said it, someone who is
beloved to my colleagues over there.
b 1330
But the other legal question is: Can
the executive branch decide willy-nilly
that they are going to stop cooperating
with congressional subpoenas and re-
quests for documents? No, they can’t,
and I hope that that would be a uni-
fying dictum for everybody in this
body that we stand up for the right of
the people’s Representatives to obtain
the information that we need.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5843
July 16, 2019
Now, my dear friend from Georgia
made the point that he wished that we
could proceed in a more bipartisan
fashion. I have actually been very
cheered by the number of our GOP col-
leagues who have denounced the Presi-
dent’s remarks over the weekend and
this week.
For example, we get a statement
from—I am not making it up. I know
that they are out there. Here we go.
Mr. FRED UPTON: ‘‘Frankly, I’m ap-
palled by the President’s tweets.
There’s no excuse. The President’s
tweets were flat-out wrong and
uncalled for.’’
PETE OLSON: ‘‘The tweet President
Trump posted over the weekend about
fellow Members of Congress are not re-
flective of the values’’ of my district.
‘‘I urge our President immediately dis-
avow his comments.’’
Senator MURKOWSKI: ‘‘There’s no ex-
cuse for the President’s spiteful com-
ments—they were absolutely unaccept-
able and this needs to stop.’’
John Kasich: ‘‘What
@realDonaldTrump said about Demo-
crat women in Congress is deplorable
and beneath the dignity of the office.
We all, including Republicans, need to
speak out against these kind of com-
ments that do nothing more than di-
vide us and create deep animosity.
. . .’’
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, how
much time is remaining?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 41⁄2 minutes
remaining. The gentleman from Mary-
land has 30 seconds remaining.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, again, I regret that
there is so much that is packed into
this rule. It is one of the reasons I
urged defeat of the rule today.
Everyone in this Chamber wants to
vote to have this debate on the na-
tional intelligence reauthorization bill.
Everybody wants to be a part of that.
Again, 31 amendments made in order
will improve that bill, a bipartisan
product coming out of a very conten-
tious committee.
The rest of these issues are more
complex. And I don’t mean complex be-
cause we shouldn’t discuss them. We
should. I mean complex because we
haven’t discussed them.
I think I am prepared to yield time if
the gentleman needs it. I know my
friend from Maryland is not the author
of the resolution condemning the
President, but the gentleman men-
tioned my friend from Texas (Mr.
OLSON) and Mr. OLSON’s comments on
the Republican side of the aisle.
I ask the gentleman, was Mr. OLSON
consulted to try to create the language
that we see before us today?
I yield to the gentleman from Mary-
land.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I am
sorry. Does the gentleman mind re-
peating?
Mr. WOODALL. Was the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. OLSON) consulted as
we tried to draft this language that is
before us today?
I yield to the gentleman.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I am sure
the gentleman was not, unfortunately,
just because of the press of time.
Mr. WOODALL. Reclaiming my time,
was Mr. UPTON, who the gentleman ref-
erenced as having sympathetic words
to say, was the gentleman consulted
about the drafting of this resolution?
I yield to the gentleman.
Mr. RASKIN. The vast majority of
Members on both sides were not con-
sulted in the manner——
Mr. WOODALL. Reclaiming my time,
so Mr. Kasich was also not consulted
and Ms. MURKOWSKI also not consulted.
Mr. Speaker, if we are talking about
a serious issue and we are going to
craft a serious response and we want to
speak with one voice from this institu-
tion, might it be a good idea for there
to be at least one conversation between
Democrats and Republicans about how
to proceed?
Might it be a good idea to have more
than one conversation?
Might it be a good idea to put par-
tisanship aside and actually do those
things that I know my friend from
Maryland wants to do and I want to do
arm in arm with him?
We keep missing opportunities in
this Congress, Mr. Speaker, opportuni-
ties to make this institution stronger,
opportunities to make this Nation
stronger. We are missing them, and we
are creating scars along the way.
What could be an operation in build-
ing trust has become an operation in
building distrust.
What could be an operation designed
to heal, I suspect, is going to be an op-
eration that brings more needless pain.
We have a good bill in the intel-
ligence reauthorization, Mr. Speaker.
We have a good series of bills in arms
export control. We could be down here
talking about those because of the bi-
partisan work that has gone into it al-
ready.
Not one conversation has been had
between tweets over a weekend and a
resolution condemning those on the
floor of the House, not one effort made
to speak with one voice in the United
States House. That tells you just about
everything someone needs to know
about why this resolution is on the
floor with these two contempt resolu-
tions in this place at this time.
Mr. Speaker, I urge defeat of the
rule. I urge defeat of the previous ques-
tion.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I urge a
‘‘yes’’ vote on the rule and the previous
question.
I will just take a second to say to my
friend that there have been hundreds of
conversations that have been taking
place here, but, of course, the gen-
tleman knows that the committee sys-
tem works in such a way that legisla-
tion is put in and not everybody is con-
sulted. The legislation he has praised
so effusively today in the Intelligence
Committee, none of us outside of the
Intelligence Committee were consulted
about it.
So I think we have got a consensus
here rejecting and repudiating the
tenor and the meaning of the Presi-
dent’s remarks, and I hope that this
process of dialogue which has been so
wonderful today with the gentleman
from Georgia leads to an outcome
where all of us will vote for the pre-
vious question.
The text of the material previously
referred to by Mr. WOODALL is as fol-
lows:
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 491
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing:
SEC. 7. That immediately upon adoption of
this resolution, the House shall resolve into
the Committee of the Whole House on the
state of the Union for consideration of the
bill (H.R. 3765) to amend title 13, United
States Code, to require that any question-
naire used for a decennial census of popu-
lation contains a question regarding citizen-
ship, and for other purposes. The first read-
ing of the bill shall be dispensed with. All
points of order against consideration of the
bill are waived. General debate shall be con-
fined to the bill and shall not exceed one
hour equally divided and controlled by the
chair and ranking minority member of the
Committee on Oversight and Reform. After
general debate the bill shall be considered
for amendment under the five minute rule.
All points of order against provisions in the
bill are waived. When the committee rises
and reports the bill back to the House with
a recommendation that the bill do pass, the
previous question shall be considered as or-
dered on the bill and amendments thereto to
final passage without intervening motion ex-
cept one motion to recommit with or with-
out instructions. If the Committee of the
Whole rises and reports that it has come to
no resolution on the bill, then on the next
legislative day the House shall, immediately
after the third daily order of business under
clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Com-
mittee of the Whole for further consideration
of the bill.
SEC. 8. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not
apply to the consideration of H.R. 3765.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time, and I
move the previous question on the res-
olution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on ordering the previous
question.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, on that
I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair
will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum
time for any electronic vote on the
question of the adoption of the resolu-
tion.
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 230, nays
189, not voting 13, as follows:

CONDEMNING PRESIDENT TRUMP’S
RACIST COMMENTS DIRECTED
AT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, pursuant
to House Resolution 491, I call up the
resolution (H. Res. 489) condemning
President Trump’s racist comments di-
rected at Members of Congress, and ask
for its immediate consideration in the
House.
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
CLEAVER). Pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 491, the resolution is considered
read.
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 489
Whereas the Founders conceived America
as a haven of refuge for people fleeing from
religious and political persecution, and
Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and
James Madison all emphasized that the Na-
tion gained as it attracted new people in
search of freedom and livelihood for their
families;
Whereas the Declaration of Independence
defined America as a covenant based on
equality, the unalienable Rights of life, lib-
erty and the pursuit of happiness, and gov-
ernment by the consent of the people;
Whereas Benjamin Franklin said at the
Constitutional convention, ‘‘When foreigners
after looking about for some other Country
in which they can obtain more happiness,
give a preference to ours, it is a proof of at-
tachment which ought to excite our con-
fidence and affection’’;
Whereas President Franklin D. Roosevelt
said, ‘‘Remember, remember always, that all
of us, and you and I especially, are descended
from immigrants and revolutionists’’;
Whereas immigration of people from all
over the Earth has defined every stage of
American history and propelled our social,
economic, political, scientific, cultural, ar-
tistic, and technological progress as a peo-
ple, and all Americans, except for the de-
scendants of Native people and enslaved Afri-
can Americans, are immigrants or descend-
ants of immigrants;
Whereas the commitment to immigration
and asylum has been not a partisan cause
but a powerful national value that has in-
fused the work of many Presidents;
Whereas American patriotism is defined
not by race or ethnicity but by devotion to
the Constitutional ideals of equality, liberty,
inclusion, and democracy and by service to
our communities and struggle for the com-
mon good;
Whereas President John F. Kennedy, whose
family came to the United States from Ire-
land, stated in his 1958 book ‘‘A Nation of
Immigrants’’ that ‘‘The contribution of im-
migrants can be seen in every aspect of our
national life. We see it in religion, in poli-
tics, in business, in the arts, in education,
even in athletics and entertainment. There
is no part of our nation that has not been
touched by our immigrant background. Ev-
erywhere immigrants have enriched and
strengthened the fabric of American life.’’;
Whereas President Ronald Reagan in his
last speech as President conveyed ‘‘An obser-
vation about a country which I love’’;
Whereas as President Reagan observed, the
torch of Lady Liberty symbolizes our free-
dom and represents our heritage, the com-
pact with our parents, our grandparents, and
our ancestors, and it is the Statue of Liberty
and its values that give us our great and spe-
cial place in the world;
Whereas other countries may seek to com-
pete with us, but in one vital area, as ‘‘a bea-
con of freedom and opportunity that draws
the people of the world, no country on Earth
comes close’’;
Whereas it is the great life force of ‘‘each
generation of new Americans that guaran-
tees that America’s triumph shall continue
unsurpassed’’ through the 21st century and
beyond and is part of the ‘‘magical, intoxi-
cating power of America’’;
Whereas this is ‘‘one of the most important
sources of America’s greatness: we lead the
world because, unique among nations, we
draw our people -- our strength -- from every
country and every corner of the world, and
by doing so we continuously renew and en-
rich our nation’’;
Whereas ‘‘thanks to each wave of new ar-
rivals to this land of opportunity, we’re a na-
tion forever young, forever bursting with en-
ergy and new ideas, and always on the cut-
ting edge’’, always leading the world to the
next frontier;
Whereas this openness is vital to our fu-
ture as a Nation, and ‘‘if we ever closed the
door to new Americans, our leadership in the
world would soon be lost’’; and
Whereas President Donald Trump’s racist
comments have legitimized fear and hatred
of new Americans and people of color: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives—
(1) believes that immigrants and their de-
scendants have made America stronger, and
that those who take the oath of citizenship
are every bit as American as those whose
families have lived in the United States for
many generations;
(2) is committed to keeping America open
to those lawfully seeking refuge and asylum
from violence and oppression, and those who
are willing to work hard to live the Amer-
ican Dream, no matter their race, ethnicity,
faith, or country of origin; and
(3) strongly condemns President Donald
Trump’s racist comments that have legiti-
mized and increased fear and hatred of new
Americans and people of color by saying that
our fellow Americans who are immigrants,
and those who may look to the President
like immigrants, should ‘‘go back’’ to other
countries, by referring to immigrants and
asylum seekers as ‘‘invaders,’’ and by saying
that Members of Congress who are immi-
grants (or those of our colleagues who are
wrongly assumed to be immigrants) do not
belong in Congress or in the United States of
America.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution shall be debatable for 1 hour,
equally divided and controlled by the
chair and ranking minority member of
the Committee on the Judiciary.
The gentleman from New York (Mr.
NADLER) and the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. COLLINS) each will control 30
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New York.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H. Res. 489.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself 3 minutes.
Mr. Speaker, the comments described
in this resolution were not just offen-
sive to our colleagues; they were incon-
sistent with the principles and values
upon which this Nation was founded.
In urging four female Members of
Congress of color to ‘‘go back’’ where
they came from, these comments were
not only factually incorrect, but they
were also deeply hurtful and divisive.
These were shocking comments, even
from an administration that rips chil-
dren from the arms of their parents
and warehouses asylum seekers in fa-
cilities under inhumane conditions. We
cannot let this moment pass without a
forceful condemnation.
Need I remind the Speaker that this
is the same President who defended the
‘‘very fine people’’ at the neo-Nazi
march in Charlottesville, who de-
nounced the ‘‘s-hole countries’’ in Afri-
ca and the Caribbean, who claimed that
Haitian immigrants ‘‘all have AIDS,’’

and who declared that a Mexican
American judge who was born in the
United States had an ‘‘inherent con-
flict of interest’’ against him.
At every turn, Democrats have de-
nounced offensive comments that ema-
nate from the White House, but the si-
lence coming from the other side of the
aisle has been deafening. I hope that
will finally change today.
This Congress must speak—loudly
and with one voice—to condemn the
President’s words and, more impor-
tantly, to condemn the sentiments be-
hind them.
The United States should be a beacon
of hope and a refuge to those who need
its protection, and it should welcome
with open arms those who embody our
values and ideals.
From our earliest days as a nation,
we have welcomed people fleeing perse-
cution and violence and those who seek
economic opportunity and freedom in a
land whose diversity is one of its great-
est strengths. But the President has,
instead, pursued a relentless campaign
to build both a literal and a figurative
wall around this Nation.
We must not turn our backs on our
historic commitment to immigration
and to refuge, and we must not fall
prey to racial stereotypes and nativist
fear-mongering that thinks that some
immigrants who came here years ago
are okay but those who come here
today, because they are from so-called
s-hole countries, are not okay.
It was Martin Luther King who told
us: ‘‘I have a dream that my four little
children will one day live in a nation
where they will not be judged by the
color of their skin, but by the content
of their character.’’
The offensive words by the President
undermine that dream. They con-
tradict that dream.
Mr. Chair, I hope that all of my col-
leagues will join me in denouncing rac-
ism and in supporting this resolution,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, this is the third time
that I have stood in this well this year
on this floor about this subject, and I
have been clear at every juncture: Rac-
ism, bigotry, and anti-Semitism will
find no refuge in the people’s House.
We expect each other to speak fairly,
truthfully, and respectfully of all our
fellow Members of Congress and of the
President—not because we agree with
each other all the time, but because we
have great respect for the Americans
who elected us and to represent them
from one end of Pennsylvania Avenue
to the other.
I come here today, Mr. Speaker, with
much grief and many questions. The
first may be procedural, but it is not
trivial.
The Democrats wrote a resolution
last night. It is on the floor today. I
just have a question: What happened to
the 72-hour rule ensuring Members
have an opportunity to review legisla-
tion and seek feedback from constitu-
ents before voting on it? What hap-
pened to regular order? This never
came through committee.
Why does the House have rules if the
Democratic majority only follows
them when politically convenient?
And, also, as was brought up in the
rules debate, there was even no con-
sultation with others who would want
to be a part of this.
The President has every right to be
frustrated with Congress for the work
that we have failed to do on multiple
fronts, including the border. I also un-
derstand that his recent tweets make
it hard for us to move forward.
Attacks are like quicksand: They
trap and they defeat us before we know
it. They are distracting us from legis-
lating. That was true when a lawmaker
implied last week that a Member of the
House leadership was singling out
‘‘newly elected women of color’’ and
when other Representatives were ac-
cused of enabling a racist system.
It is true as we see little to no con-
cern from my colleagues across the
aisle when a foreign flag is raised over
an American facility or a terrorist
firebombed another facility.
It is true when the President of the
United States, out of frustration,
tweeted this weekend, and it is true of
many comments coming from law-
makers today.
In fact, it is interesting for my chair-
man to say that they have called out
the President every time but, also,
many times—and this is just a small
listing of every week that they have
not called out their own Members for
things that I cannot read on this floor.
Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, we are
too quick this Congress to allow polit-
ical ends to justify procedural means.
But that is not democracy rooted in
our unalienable rights, rights the sec-
ond clause in this resolution affirms.
The resolution is simply a lesson in po-
litical expediency.
Integrity is a prerequisite to our cov-
enant to govern by the consent of the
people, which this resolution also af-
firms.
We knew when we voted for the
House rules this January that we could
not, in this Chamber, use certain lan-
guage about other democratically
elected leaders. We agreed to let ideas
compete for our votes and use rhetoric
as a tool to build bridges instead of as
kindling to burn those bridges down.
Yet not a week goes by, as we have al-
ready pointed out, without Members of
this body issuing statements or tweets
that I could not and will not read from
this floor without violating our rules.
It is amazing, but not surprising,
that some of my colleagues are using
this platform to call for impeachment
since many have been making that call
since November of 2016—no justifica-
tion then, and definitely not now.
You see, Mr. Speaker, pleas for deco-
rum are not merely a refuge for law-
makers who find themselves in the mi-
nority. Decorum is a symptom of a
healthy and confident democracy.
When we can debate ideas on this floor,
decorum ensures democracy’s every
voice can be heard.
I would like to lend my voice to the
chorus of lawmakers supporting the
first 15 clauses of this resolution, but
for the misguided title and the fourth
page of this resolution, we could have
had a suspension vote.
To its credit, the resolution states
the House of Representatives ‘‘is com-
mitted to keeping America open to
those lawfully seeking refuge and asy-
lum.’’ I agree.
Everyone who votes for this resolu-
tion will now be on record as opposing
illegal immigration, and I hope we can
all work together to address the border
crisis based on that common founda-
tion.
Again, you don’t need a vote on this
resolution to do that. You simply have
to look at the border and acknowledge
the crisis.
But we will still have a problem with
this resolution. We cannot, by our own
House rules, support a resolution that
labels the President in this way, and I
will not.
The rules that have governed this
body since the first United States Con-
gress do not allow us to devolve in that
way. However, it doesn’t mean that we
can’t condemn racial or ethnic preju-
dice. It doesn’t mean we can’t deci-
sively reject anti-Semitism, as we have
on this floor. In my view, we have not
done it so far in this Congress to that
extent, but we have time for a clarion
call on that front. I know some col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle who
could join each other in that convic-
tion.
Our own standards of decorum, how-
ever, in fact, empower us to welcome to
America every person who respects our
laws and wants to help defend our free-
doms. These standards also give us a
platform to admit when we and those
around us make mistakes.
When we consider the power of this
Chamber to legislate for the common
good, I wonder why my colleagues have
become so eager to attack the Presi-
dent that they are willing to sacrifice
the rules, precedents, and the integrity
of the people’s House for an unprece-
dented vote that undercuts its very
democratic processes.
I wonder, if the comments in view
today are what some of my colleagues
say they are, why this resolution had
to rephrase them to make its point.
The resolution condemns comments in
a way that exposes the breathtaking
partisanship of today’s exercise.
The resolution quotes only three
words from the comments it rejects—
the words ‘‘go back’’ and ‘‘invaders.’’
Beyond those three words, the resolu-
tion substitutes its own phrasing and
editorializing for the words this resolu-
tion has in view.
Again, a partisan show. That is a tell
that today’s resolution is more of a po-
litical jab than anything else. It is,
therefore, a signal for us to take a mo-
ment to look inward.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5847
July 16, 2019
I wonder if, when we are tempted to
accuse our sister, our brother, our fel-
low American, political foe, or Madam
Speaker of racism—by the way, I do
not believe that the President is a rac-
ist. I do not believe the Speaker of this
House is a racist. I do not believe the
majority leader is a racist. I do not be-
lieve the minority leader is a racist.
We can go down this line. I do not be-
lieve that. Then why do we insist on
using this floor to litigate the pro-
priety of statements made outside
these walls?
We assign a lot of wicked intent to a
lot of tweets, even though 280 char-
acters offers us the least context for
making our points and endless poten-
tial for misunderstanding each other.
To be fair, a lot of political speech
today seems to be made to deepen our
divide by highlighting our differences,
and that is a cause for sadness. That is
exactly what the rules of decorum in
this body are designed to guard
against.
We have a choice this afternoon, Mr.
Speaker. We can pursue escalation
against our fellow Americans, or we
can pursue reconciliation on their be-
half. Only one of those options makes
room for this body to do its job: the
legislating of the solutions for the
challenges of the American people.
Many of the Members are my friends,
and I am thankful for the chance to
work alongside each of them every day.
But, today, we renew our commitment
to the democratic ideals of this Cham-
ber by voting against a flawed resolu-
tion, against a political statement,
against something that could not even
be written in a proper way without
adding editorial and paraphrased com-
ments.
I would ask each of my friends on
both sides of the aisle to evaluate what
is before them, evaluate what we have
done, and evaluate what we don’t take
up for political convenience when it is
our side saying it.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the distinguished
majority leader of the House.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the chairman for yielding.
I want to thank the gentleman from
Georgia, who is my friend; and I want
to respectfully say to him: This resolu-
tion is not about partisanship. It is
about prejudice and the necessity to
confront it.
Mr. Speaker, my father was from
Denmark. He was born and raised in
Copenhagen and came here as an adult
in his twenties. I have a large extended
family in Denmark.
The President of the United States,
Mr. Speaker, did not tell me to go back
to Denmark.
He did not tell the Speaker of this
House, a woman proud of her Italian
American heritage, to go back to Italy.
He did not tell the Irish American
Members of this body to go back to Ire-
land or tell those of German ancestry
to go back to Germany. No.
He told four women of color, three of
whom are natural-born citizens, born
and raised in their home country of
America, to ‘‘go back’’ to their coun-
tries.
This is their country, Mr. Speaker, I
would tell the President.
And it is the country of our colleague
who came here as a refugee from Soma-
lia. She endured hardships and arrived
on our shores like so many others,
seeking freedom, safety, and oppor-
tunity.
She is an American citizen, one who
chose to give back to her community
and our country through public serv-
ice. This is her country.
I will not speculate on this floor
about the motives or intentions of the
President, but no one can dispute that
the words he said and wrote were racist
words—and have been called such by
Republicans—with a long history of
being used to demean, dismiss, and
denigrate some American citizens as
less than others, as not fully belonging
in our country because of the color of
their skin or the origin of their fami-
lies.
Mr. Speaker, to oppose this resolu-
tion is, in effect, saying the words were
acceptable.
b 1430
They were not acceptable. Such
words should never be acceptable from
the leader of this country, or frankly,
anybody else. They demean our Dec-
laration of Independence; they demean
our Constitution; and they demean our
Pledge of Allegiance: ‘‘One Nation . . .
indivisible.’’
So I urge this House to come to-
gether and support this resolution. No
matter whether one supports this
President or not; whether one believes
he is a racist or not; vote for this reso-
lution that condemns the words he
spoke. They hurt. They are not Amer-
ican. They are not us. The sentiment
was not one we ought to espouse.
Mr. Speaker, I say to the President,
if I were speaking to him: The next
time you wish to denigrate and demean
those who came here, or the children
and grandchildren of immigrants, say
it to me. Say it to all of us in this
House. Say it to every descendant of
immigrants.
Express the sentiment of the House
of Representatives that this is not the
conversation that we have in America.
We lift our lamp beside the golden
door. Let us keep that flame bright.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Before
we go any further, let me just remind
Members to refrain from engaging in
personality-based remarks toward the
President.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman
from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK).
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, we
have, unfortunately, entered a period
of our history when our political rhet-
oric has become hyperbolic, just as our
political views are becoming increas-
ingly irreconcilable. We would all be
well-advised not to continue down this
road.
‘‘America, love it or leave it,’’ is not
a new sentiment nor a radical senti-
ment, and it certainly is not a racist
sentiment. It should remind us of com-
monly-held and enduring founding
principles that ought to be uniting us
as a free people: Respect for the rule of
law, and for the uniquely American
principles of individual liberty, con-
stitutionally-limited government, and
personal responsibility that have pro-
duced the happiest, most productive
and most powerful Nation in the his-
tory of the world.
Every nation has a right to protect
its culture, traditions, institutions,
and principles. This fundamental con-
sensus is what binds us together and
unites us as a free people, and it is
what makes possible all of the com-
promises and accommodations required
by democratic self-government.
We have entered an era when that
consensus is breaking down. We have
seen a growing hostility to our Amer-
ican Founders, our American founding
principles, and our proud American
heritage.
Legal immigration, immigrants who
come to our country by obeying our
laws, respecting our Nation’s sov-
ereignty, and bringing with them a sin-
cere desire to embrace our Constitu-
tion and the principles of liberty that
animate and inform our form of gov-
ernment, is integral to this process.
Some of the most patriotic Ameri-
cans I know are legal immigrants who
obeyed our laws, who waited patiently
in line, who did everything our country
asked of them.
Some of the most unpatriotic Ameri-
cans I know were born here and have
enjoyed all of the blessings of liberty,
without ever appreciating or even un-
derstanding the principles that pro-
duced our Nation’s greatness and its
goodness.
Socialism and slavery spring from
the same principle—in Lincoln’s words:
‘‘It is the same spirit that says, ‘you
work and toil and earn bread, and I’ll
eat it.’’’ He reminded us that ‘‘A house
divided against itself cannot stand.’’
He said: ‘‘I do not expect the house to
fall—but I do expect it will cease to be
divided. It will become all one thing or
all the other.’’
He understood that freedom and slav-
ery were antithetical; and though they
might be held together in a temporary
accommodation, they could not coexist
for long.
Today, we face the same conflict be-
tween freedom and socialism, and it is
time to choose.
Now, I wish the President were more
temperate in the words he sometimes
uses, and I agree that the tone of his
recent remarks was unnecessarily pro-
vocative. But his central point is irref-
utable. There is no requirement for
those who hate our country to remain
here when there are so many other

countries with different principles and
values to choose from and that have, in
turn, produced very different results.
This is as true of those born here as
those who have come here from abroad.
The President spoke not of race but of
patriotism, American patriotism. And
to call that racist fundamentally mis-
understands and misrepresents the
question before our country today.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
31⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from New
Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI), the sponsor
of the resolution.
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker,
when I saw the President’s comments
over the weekend, my first thought
was, my politics may not always be the
same as the Congresswomen he was at-
tacking; but all of us are Americans.
And unlike most of them, I was actu-
ally born in a foreign country.
I took the oath to support and defend
the Constitution of the United States
when I was 10 years old, with my mom,
when I was sworn in to be a citizen 5
years after we came here from Poland.
Does the President think I should go
back because I am an immigrant who
disagrees with his policies?
There are 44 million of us American
citizens who were born somewhere else,
and we new Americans know what it
means to be American because we
chose America. We know the alter-
native.
Many of us do come from broken
countries, a communist country, in my
case, broken by communism and, in
many cases, broken by leaders who did
just what we are condemning today,
using race and religion to divide peo-
ple.
The President may be doing it cyni-
cally. He wants the drama. He wants
the reality show.
In my district, we have to deal with
the reality that these words are dan-
gerous. Every synagogue in my district
either has armed security or is strug-
gling with the question of whether to
have it. Every mosque has State Police
coming to Friday prayers.
We know that the words the Presi-
dent uses to drive up his ratings can be
like sparks to the gasoline of disturbed
minds in our country; that the man
who massacred Jews in Pittsburgh was
obsessed with migrant caravans and
blamed Jews for helping refugees; that
the man who murdered Muslims in
Christchurch, New Zealand, believed
immigrants are invaders who should go
back to their country.
These fringe haters have always been
with us. Never before have their twist-
ed thoughts been legitimized by the
highest leaders in our land.
Yesterday, after the President’s
tweets, the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer
website gloated that this is the kind of
white nationalism we voted for.
Now, we have to decide, is this the
kind of politics that we want in our
country?
Mr. Speaker, this resolution is not
really about the President. We know
who he is. My Republican colleagues
know who he is.
The question is—the only question
left to us is, who are we? Because this
is not about him. This is about us.
Are we still the country of immi-
grants and of laws that every great
American leader, from Ben Franklin,
to FDR, to John F. Kennedy, to George
Bush, believed in?
Do we still believe what Ronald
Reagan said that: ‘‘Americans lead the
world because, unique among nations,
we draw our people, our strength, from
every country and every corner of the
world;’’ that new Americans ‘‘renew
our pride and gratitude in the United
States of America, the greatest, freest
Nation in the world’’?
This is the choice that every Member
of the House will have to make to-
night. Do we agree with President Rea-
gan’s hopeful, confident, patriotic vi-
sion of America, or with President
Trump’s message of fear?
Mr. Speaker, Republicans and Demo-
crats can afford to disagree about
many things in this House; but let us
not be divided on decency to our fellow
Americans.
At this defining moment for our
country and for this body, let us come
together to support this resolution.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman
from Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ).
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, I was one of the first Republicans, I
believe, to speak out once the com-
ments became public on Sunday. I did
it Sunday afternoon, and then I did it
again on Monday.
But I cannot, in good faith, support
this resolution because I can’t possibly
overlook the partisan nature in which
it was brought forward, and the num-
ber of issues that we have control over
in the House that we are choosing to
ignore and have continued to ignore
since we were sworn in in January.
We have Members of this body who
have called detention facilities con-
centration camps; have supported peo-
ple who are labeling our Border Patrol
agents and our ICE officers as Nazis.
The gentleman just mentioned some
folks outside of this body of Congress
who may, he believes, have been in-
spired by certain comments. Well,
where is the condemnation of these?
When are we going to stand up and
condemn those who call Americans,
who are doing their jobs, by the way,
enforcing laws that we enact, Nazis?
When are we going to push back on
that?
When are we going to push back on
comments, after one of our Members
was criticized, they said, and I quote:
After the comments, ‘‘I got a text mes-
sage from a friend who’s like, hey, next
time, you know, really clarify. Maybe
talk like a fourth grader because
maybe the racist idiots would under-
stand you better’’?
Am I a racist idiot? Do I read at a
fourth-grade level? Do the Members of
this body?
Have we gotten so broken as a Con-
gress, where a simple disagreement re-
sults in us labeling one another racist
idiots? Is that who we are?
Where’s the condemnation? When are
we going to speak out about that?
And I don’t have to remind this body
about the last time we were here for a
similar process, when one of our Mem-
bers said: ‘‘It’s all about the Ben-
jamins,’’ implying that Members of
both sides of the aisle are being pur-
chased and bought by our Jewish
brothers and sisters.
When are we going to stand up and
speak out against that? Because I have
been here for 7 months now, and it is
the same thing over and over again.
And the people who lose—and we all
know this—are the constituents who
are relying on us to actually work to
solve problems.
We have done nothing to support
USMCA, to bring it up for a vote. We
have done nothing to bring down the
cost of prescription drugs. We haven’t
done anything since we have been here,
and the reason is because we have been
focused on fighting each other online;
biting back and forth; rushing in front
of the cameras; boosting our Twitter
followers; and inciting the very divi-
sion that prevents us from seeking
common ground.
I, like I know most of my colleagues,
came here to find common ground. We
came here to fight for the ideals that
make our Nation great.
I am the son of Cuban immigrants,
proudly.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB).
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
in support of this resolution because I
want every single person in my district
to know that not only are they part of
the squad, but they are—we are all
here to stay. I want them to know that
they belong; that we see and hear them
loud and clear.
Mr. Speaker, I am more proud today
than ever to be the daughter of Pales-
tinian immigrants; to be the first in
my family to graduate high school and,
later, college; to have grown up in the
city that birthed movements that
fought and won against racism and in-
equality in our country. It is a city
that taught me to never back down; to
speak up when I see injustice, and one
that elected the first of two Muslim
women serving in the United States
Congress.
This resolution chooses all of us. It
chooses you. It chooses those who are
marginalized and, more importantly, it
chooses the values that we all must
live up to.
We cannot allow anyone, especially
the President of the United States, to
erode our core American values. I urge
my colleagues to please choose our
country, choose the American people,
and to support this resolution.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman

latest legislative attack on the Presi-
dent. Much like most of the ideas and
comments coming from the leading
members of the socialist left, yester-
day’s press conference was, at best, po-
litical theater.
In the last few days, Democratic
Members of this House have attacked
the President with claims of racism.
Some have even said and then walked
back similar comments referring to the
Democratic House Speaker. None of
those accusations are based in fact.
As the representative of the people of
the Ninth Congressional District of
Pennsylvania, I feel it is most impor-
tant to address this matter and then
move on to engage in the work and the
matters of real substance and impor-
tance to the people of our country,
rather than baseless name-calling and
offensive lectures.
The ongoing policy debate across the
country will continue to be socialism
versus American exceptionalism. The
people will decide our direction. What
has really happened here is that the
President and his supporters have been
forced to endure months of allegations
of racism and ‘‘concentration camp’’
accusations.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield an additional 30 seconds to
the gentleman from Pennsylvania.
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, this ri-
diculous slander does a disservice to
our Nation and to the American people,
and I, like many, am tired of it. I urge
a ‘‘no’’ vote on the resolution aimed
purely at harassing the President of
the United States.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
said earlier today that I wish we were
not here, but we are here. Now, I wish
to indicate that I am appalled at any
commentary that demeans or hurts a
fellow human being or a fellow Amer-
ican or fellow world citizen. So the re-
counting of various statements, I real-
ize and recognize that comments were
made about statements to ease the
pain of those who were receiving it.
Right now, we are talking about
comments that came from the highest
office in the land, which really does re-
flect what this little book, the Con-
stitution, says, that this Nation was
organized to create a more perfect
union. Yet, unfortunately, the officer
in the White House, the President of
the United States, took to tweeting
and talked about the first African
American woman from the Seventh
District, the first Palestinian Amer-
ican woman, the youngest woman
elected to Congress, and the first So-
mali American woman, women of color.
It is imperative today that, along
with H. Res. 494, my resolution, we con-
demn this action, and we do it to-
gether. I ask my Republican colleagues
to vote for the underlying resolution.
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the
Committees on the Judiciary and Homeland
Security, I rise in support of H. Res. 489, a
resolution condemning President Trump’s rac-
ist comments directed at Members of Con-
gress.
Mr. Speaker, on November 6, 2018, in an
election widely regarded as a referendum on
the performance and disapproval of the Ad-
ministration of President Donald J. Trump, the
American people voted to vest control of the
U.S. House of Representatives in the Demo-
cratic Party to restore the system of checks
and balances designed by the Framers in
1787 in Philadelphia.
The Representatives elected to the 116th
Congress comprise the most diverse class in
American history with respect to its racial, eth-
nic, and religious composition, and also in-
cludes the largest contingent of female Rep-
resentatives and the most members ever of
the LGBTQ community.
Among the cohort of the 40 Representatives
first elected to the Congress in the November
2018 election are several whose membership
is historic, including the Representative for the
Seventh District of Massachusetts, the first Af-
rican American woman elected from the Com-
monwealth of Massachusetts; the Representa-
tive from the Thirteenth District of Michigan,
the first Palestinian-American woman elected
to Congress; the Representative from the
Fourteenth District of New York, the youngest
woman ever elected to Congress; and the
Representative from the Fifth District of Min-
nesota, the first Somali-American elected to
Congress.
In the discharge of their official duties as
Members of Congress, these talented and
dedicated Members of Congress traveled to
the southern border of the United States to
observe the living conditions and treatment re-
ceived by migrants and refugees seeking asy-
lum in the United States who are currently
being held in detention facilities operated
under control or supervision of the U.S. Cus-
toms and Border Protection (CBP), some con-
sisting of nothing more than tent villages
cordoned off under highways.
Upon their return to the Capitol, these Mem-
bers of Congress reported their shock and
horror regarding the appalling and inhumane
conditions to which detainees were being sub-
jected by CPB at a public hearing of a House
Committee on Oversight and Reform.
On July 14, 2019, the President of the
United States reacted to the criticism of his
Administration’s treatment of detainees by
these Members of Congress in a series of un-
hinged tweets that questioned their loyalty to
the United States and implied that due to the
circumstances of their birth they had no right
to exercise the responsibilities and privileges
of duly elected Members of Congress.
Specifically, the President tweeted that it
was:
‘‘So interesting to see ‘‘Progressive’’ Demo-
crat Congresswomen, who originally came
from countries whose governments are a com-
plete and total catastrophe, the worst, most
corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if
they even have a functioning government at
all), now loudly . . . and viciously telling the
people of the United States, the greatest and
most powerful Nation on earth, how our gov-
ernment is to be run. Why don’t they go back
and help fix the totally broken and crime in-
fested places from which they came.’’
The President’s statements are false in that
three of Members of Congress he impugned
are in fact natural born citizens and the fourth-
is a naturalized citizen.
Although the recent statements of the Presi-
dent are inaccurate and offensive, they are
consistent with prior statements he has made
to stoke to division, discord, and disharmony
among the American people.
Let us not forget that the current President
of the United States burnished his political
reputation by claiming falsely for more than 5
years that his predecessor was born in Kenya
and not in the United States and thus was an
illegitimate President. The current President of
the United States launched his 2016 campaign
for the Presidency by saying of persons from
Mexico seeking to immigrate to the United
States: ‘‘They’re bringing drugs. They’re bring-
ing crime. They’re rapists.’’
The current President of the United States
claimed that a Hispanic federal jurist could not
preside over a court proceeding to which then
presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and
the Trump Organization were defendants ac-
cused of civil fraud because ‘‘He’s a Mexican!’’
In January 2018 the current President of the
United States is reported to have inquired of
his advisors: ‘‘Why are we having all these
people from (expletive deleted) countries
come here?’’, referring to persons from coun-
tries in Africa, the Caribbean, and Central and
South America.
And most contemptible of all, on August 15,
2017 the current President of the United
States said he regarded as some ‘‘very fine
people,’’ the neo-Nazis, white supremacists,
and Ku Klux Klansmen who descended on the
peaceful community of Charlottesville, Virginia
to advocate racism and who were met by
peaceful counterprotestors in a clash that the
white supremacists turned violent and resulted
in the death of Heather Heyer and left injured
many other innocent persons who were gath-
ered to affirm the principles of the Declaration
of Independence and the U.S. Constitution,
and to honor the sacrifice of unsung American
heroes who devoted their lives to the ongoing
quest to continue perfecting our union.
Mr. Speaker, the recent and past state-
ments and actions of the current President of
the United States demean the office he holds
and falls short of the standard set by the 16th
President, whose administration was devoted
to unity, healing, and ending racial division.
In his famous March 4, 1861, Inaugural Ad-
dress, President Abraham Lincoln foretold the
reasons why the efforts of the current Presi-
dent of the United States to rend our union
are destined to fail:
‘‘We are not enemies, but friends. We must
not be enemies. Though passion may have
strained, it must not break our bonds of affec-
tion. The mystic chords of memory will swell
when again touched, as surely they will be, by
the better angels of our nature.’’
Before closing, Mr. Speaker, I think it appro-
priate to share my perspective on immigration
and significant and positive impact it has in
the development of this, the greatest nation in
human history.
Like the Framers did in the summer of
1776, it is fitting that we gather in the nation’s
capital on a sweltering July day to reflect upon
America’s long and continuing struggle for jus-
tice, equality, and opportunity.
After all, all that any of us wants is an hon-
ored place in the American family.
I am often reminded that as I speak there is
a family somewhere about to begin a dan-
gerous but hopeful quest.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5850 July 16, 2019
Somewhere south of the border, maybe
across the Rio Grande from El Paso, Laredo,
Corpus Christi, or Brownsville or maybe just
south of Tucson or San Diego or Douglass,
Arizona.
Somewhere there is a family in the Old
Country anxiously about to embark on their
own journey to the New World of America.
They come for the same reason so many
millions came before them, in this century and
last, from this continent and from every other.
They come for the same reason families
have always come to America: to be free of
fear and hunger, to better their condition, to
begin their world anew, to give their children
a chance for a better life.
Like previous waves of immigrants, they too
will wage all and risk all to reach the side-
walks of Houston or Los Angeles or Phoenix
or Chicago or Atlanta or Denver or Detroit.
They will risk death in the desert; they will
brave the elements, they will risk capture and
crime, they will endure separation from loved
ones.
And if they make it to the Promised Land of
America, no job will be beneath them.
They will cook our food, clean our houses,
cut our grass, and care for our kids.
They will be cheated by some and exploited
by others.
They work in sunlight but live in twilight, be-
tween the shadows; not fully welcome as new
Americans but wanted as low-wage workers.
Somewhere near the borders tonight, a fam-
ily will cross over into the New World, willed
by the enduring power of the American
Dream.
I urge all Members to join me in supporting
H. Res. 489.
All American should take pride in and cele-
brate the ethnic, racial, and religious diversity
that has made the United States the leader of
the community of nations and the beacon of
hope and inspiration to oppressed persons ev-
erywhere.
And in addition to the love and pride Ameri-
cans justifiably have for their country, all per-
sons in the United States should cherish and
exercise the rights, privileges, and responsibil-
ities guaranteed by the Constitution of the
United States.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentle-
woman from West Virginia (Mrs. MIL-
LER).
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to speak in opposition to the res-
olution on the floor.
For the past 7 months, the President
has stated that there is a crisis on our
border. Republican House leadership
has said there is a crisis on the border.
My colleagues have said there is a cri-
sis on the border. And I have said there
is a crisis on the border.
Throughout this, the Washington
Democrats have denied it again and
again. From the party leadership and
the committee chairs in hearings and
even on the House floor, many have
said that the crisis is fake, phony, non-
existent, manufactured, imaginary,
and false. They turned a blind eye to a
crisis because of political opposition,
and the media followed suit.
A few weeks ago, several of my col-
leagues across the aisle took a trip to
our southern border, bringing cameras
and journalists along with them. They
finally came to terms with what the
Republicans have been saying for
months.
However, instead of focusing on the
root of the problem, underfunding,
overcrowding, backlogged cases, and
unprecedented surges, they opposed
funding and passed a bill to ban con-
struction on the southern border.
For 7 months, my colleagues across
the aisle have denied a crisis and failed
to act. They still haven’t acted. I want
to work together to solve this crisis.
Instead, we are here debating political
nonsense. I have had enough talk about
tweets, squads, infighting, labels, and
petty disagreements.
When we look at the content of the
legislation brought up for discussion
today, it is no surprise that the Amer-
ican people have such a low approval of
Congress. If it is not a messaging bill
to placate the activists, it is an ad-
vancement of the socialist agenda, a
bill to handcuff our President, or a de-
nouncement of American values.
I came to Congress to create jobs,
grow the economy, innovate our energy
industry, and fix West Virginia’s infra-
structure. I was sent here to move our
country forward and to solve the prob-
lems that actually affect the lives of
those we represent. To improve our
communities, our country, that is why
we are all here.
This resolution is a waste of time. I
urge my colleagues to oppose this leg-
islation and any legislation that
doesn’t deliver the results for our coun-
try that our citizens deserve.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the distinguished gentleman
from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN).
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I join in
supporting this resolution. I felt that
we should have had a stronger resolu-
tion that censured the President, H.
Res. 490, because the conduct that has
been charged is beneath the Office of
the President. He should not disparage
people and suggest they go back to
where they were born.
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ was born in the
Bronx, and her parents were born in
Puerto Rico. Mr. Trump should know
that Puerto Rico is the United States
of America.
From references to Haiti and African
countries as ‘‘-hole’’ countries to the
‘‘fine people on both sides’’ in Char-
lottesville with neo-Nazis and Klans-
men there, he has gone out of his way
to find opportunities to besmirch His-
panic Americans, people of Mexican de-
scent, African Americans, and African
countries. This is wrong and beneath
the Office of the President.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Let me
remind Members, again, to refrain
from engaging in personality-based re-
marks toward the President or any
other Member.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I ask for a time check on both sides,
please.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 121⁄4 minutes
remaining, and the gentleman from
New York has 20 minutes remaining.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, at this time I yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.
DUFFY).
Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman for yielding.
I just want to note at the start of
this resolution for the first three pages
I agree with everything. We have great
quotes in here of our Founders and
American Presidents who talk about
the strength of this country that has
come from immigrants and immigra-
tion, and I wholeheartedly concur.
As we get to page 4, though, I have
significant disagreement. I would note
that on page 4 on the whereas, it is
noted that ‘‘Trump’s racist comments
have legitimized fear and hatred of new
Americans,’’ and I just want to make a
point to my friends across the aisle be-
cause in paragraph 2 you note that it is
committed to keeping America open to
those who lawfully seek refuge and
asylum from violence and oppression.
Lawfully seek refuge and asylum.
But I would note that, just recently,
President Trump has said those who
have sought asylum, had a hearing, and
have a deportation order, you all are
offended by that. You didn’t include in
your resolution those who had deporta-
tion orders issued, your opposition to
them being removed. So you actually
agree with us and President Trump
that those who have lawful orders of
deportation should be sent out of the
country, just to cite your resolution.
But I want to note, Mr. Speaker, that
I have looked closely at the chain of
three tweets sent out by President
Trump, and in those tweets I see noth-
ing that references anybody’s race, not
a thing. I don’t see anyone’s name
being referenced in the tweets.
But the President is referring to peo-
ple—Congresswomen—who are anti-
American. And lo and behold, every-
body in this Chamber knows who he is
talking about. Who are the anti-Amer-
ican Members of Congress? He didn’t
say their names. He did not say their
race, but he commented on how they
view America. And we all know who he
was talking about.
I want immigrants to come to this
country, but if you come to this coun-
try, shouldn’t you love this country?
We all come here and see imperfection,
and we work every week trying to
make our country better, but to say I
wholeheartedly dislike the country,
the fact that I am going to call the
President an mf’er, good Lord, what
has the institution become?
And then to come to this floor and
chastise the President for a couple of
tweets, when that is the language we
use against him?
That is rich, Mr. Speaker, that that
is the language that the left would use
and then try to call out the President
who didn’t cite a race or he didn’t cite
a name.
I look at this, and I think we are all
called to do better and be better. We

should make this country better. But
when I look at some who say I believe
that socialism is a purer form of gov-
ernment and a better economic econ-
omy over capitalism that has given us
the freest, most generous, most pros-
perous country that has ever existed on
the face of the Earth, and we want to
trade this in for a system that has al-
ways failed?
I think you are going to see Repub-
licans push back against that, and I
think many Democrats will push back
against that, and I think that is what
this argument really comes down to.
And one other note, I look at some of
my conservatives like Candace Owens,
Diamond and Silk, Justice Thomas—
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
The gentleman from New York (Mr.
NADLER) is recognized.
Let me again say, please direct your
comments to the Chair.
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I have a
parliamentary inquiry.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman will state her parliamentary
inquiry.
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, my in-
quiry is this. My colleague across the
aisle just referred to Members of Con-
gress as ‘‘anti-American.’’ I believe
that those words are defamatory, and I
would like to ask whether that is ap-
propriate for a request for the gen-
tleman to take down his words.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair will not issue an advisory opin-
ion. I have directed both sides to please
address the Chair, number one; and
number two, I ask that Members re-
frain from engaging in any personality-
based remarks. So the Chair is not
going to issue an advisory opinion at
this point.
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, so a
Member can say that other Members of
Congress are anti-American and no res-
olution for that? We would like to ask
the gentleman to take down his words.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentlewoman making a demand that
the words be taken down?
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, yes, I
am asking that the gentleman’s words
be taken down.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In order
for the words to be taken down, the ob-
jection has to be contemporaneous to
the remarks.
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I was
trying to get the attention.
Mr. Speaker, I will relinquish the
point, but I just want to remind my
colleagues that that is completely in-
appropriate to tell any of us that we
are anti-American.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Let me
just say, if the violation occurs again,
I will interrupt mid-sentence.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I now
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. PELOSI), the dis-
tinguished Speaker of the House.
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding. I thank
him for his leadership in so many ways
in this Congress.
Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr.
MALINOWSKI and Mr. RASKIN for bring-
ing this important resolution to the
floor.
Mr. Speaker, I come to this floor
prayerfully. It is really very sad. It was
interesting to me—and I spoke out
about this—that on Sunday in Catholic
Masses, and I don’t know beyond that,
that the gospel of the day was the gos-
pel of the Good Samaritan. A person
asked Jesus, ‘‘What do I have to do to
enter the kingdom of Heaven?’’
And Christ replied, ‘‘Love thy neigh-
bor as thyself. Show mercy.’’ That very
same day he went on to talk and then
he said, ‘‘Well, how do I do this?’’
And Jesus gave him the example of
the Good Samaritan. Everyone is fa-
miliar with how a stranger helped an-
other stranger, a foreigner helped an-
other foreigner, the Good Samaritan.
Love thy neighbor as thyself, show
mercy.
b 1500
On that very same day, coinciden-
tally, ironically, sadly, whatever ad-
verb you want to use, the President
was instituting raids into the homes of
families.
I went to Spanish mass this weekend
and saw the dignity of those families,
the beauty of the children, and the fear
that the President had struck in their
hearts, as we were listening to the Gos-
pel of the Good Samaritan to show
mercy and love thy neighbor as thyself.
That very same day, unfortunately,
there were those who were not in-
formed by that Gospel.
So here we are later in that day, it
was stunning to hear the words that
were used, go home, to some of our col-
leagues, the same words that were used
to so many people in our country
whether because they weren’t born
here or because they didn’t look like
some others here: Go home.
As annoyed and as insulted as we all
should be about the President saying
that about our colleagues, it is also not
showing mercy for him to say that
about so many people in our country,
as he wants to split up families.
So, Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr.
MALINOWSKI and Mr. RASKIN for the op-
portunity to speak to the statements
that the President made later in the
day of the Gospel of the Good Samari-
tan: Mr. MALINOWSKI, who was born
abroad; Mr. RASKIN for his firm leader-
ship in advancing this important reso-
lution.
The House hopefully has come to-
gether standing as one to denounce the
White House’s xenophobic attacks on
our Members, on our people, and to de-
fend the values of America.
And what is America? America is
many things: the land of a great Con-
stitution, which is under threat; a
beautiful land that God has given us,
which is being degraded; values that we
share that are being undermined. But
America is also a Nation largely, but
not totally, largely of immigrants.
As this resolution so beautifully
states, ‘‘ . . . the Founders conceived
America as a haven for refuge for peo-
ple fleeing from religious and political
persecution, and Thomas Jefferson,
Alexander Hamilton, and James Madi-
son all emphasized that the Nation
gained as it attracted new people in
search of freedom and livelihood for
their families.’’
The resolution quotes our most
iconic Presidents, who all recognized
that immigrants are the constant rein-
vigoration of America, of hope, deter-
mination, optimism, and courage to
make the future better.
Those are American values. Those
are American traits: hope, optimism,
courage. Many of these immigrants,
when they come here with those values
and those traits, make America more
American.
Franklin Roosevelt said: ‘‘Remember
always that all of us, and you and I es-
pecially, are descended from immi-
grants.’’
President John F. Kennedy wrote
that: ‘‘The contribution of immigrants
can be seen in every aspect of our na-
tional life.’’
President Ronald Reagan so beau-
tifully in his last speech as President
of the United States, which is quoted
in this resolution, said: ‘‘If we ever
closed the door to new Americans, our
leadership in the world would soon be
lost.’’
Yet, the President’s comments about
our colleagues this weekend showed
that he does not share those American
values. These comments from the
White House are disgraceful and dis-
gusting, and the comments are racist.
How shameful to hear him continue to
defend those offensive words, words
that we have all heard him repeat not
only about our Members, but about
countless others.
Our caucus will continue to force-
fully respond to those attacks on our
Members, which reflect a fundamental
disrespect for the beautiful diversity of
America. There is no place anywhere
for the President’s words, which are
not only divisive, but dangerous, and
have legitimized and increased fear and
hatred of new Americans and people of
color.
It is so sad, because you would think
that there would be a given that we
would universally in this body just say,
of course. And there is no excuse for
any response to those words but a swift
and strong, unified condemnation.
Every single Member of this institu-
tion, Democratic and Republican,
should join us in condemning the Presi-
dent’s racist tweets. To do anything
less would be a shocking rejection of
our values and a shameful abdication
of our oath of office.

ness. But unfairness is not enough, be-
cause we want to just fight.
I abandon the Chair.
b 1645
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
HOYER). The Chair is prepared to rule.
The words of the gentlewoman from
California contain an accusation of
racist behavior on the part of the
President.
As memorialized in Deschler-Brown
Precedents, chapter 29, section 65.6,
characterizing an action as racist is
not in order. The Chair relies on the
precedent of May 15, 1984, and finds
that the words should not be used in
debate.
MOTION OFFERED BY MR. COLLINS OF GEORGIA
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I have a motion at the desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion.
The Clerk read as follows:
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia moves that the
words of the gentlewoman from California be
stricken from the RECORD.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COL-
LINS).
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the noes appeared to have it.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 190, nays
232, not voting 10, as follows:

So the motion was agreed to.
The result of the vote was announced

A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman will be allowed to proceed in
order.
The Chair announces the remaining
time in debate. The gentleman from
Georgia has 91⁄4 minutes remaining.
Without objection, the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) controls
the time and has 19 minutes remaining.
There was no objection
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia is recognized.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from California (Mr. MCCARTHY), the
minority leader.
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, on
page 1 of the original Thomas Jefferson
Manual of Parliamentary Practice he
writes that: ‘‘It is very material that
order, decency, and regularity be pre-
served in a dignified public body.’’
Now, we all have the awesome privi-
lege of serving in that dignified public
body: this, the people’s House. Our
American democracy and its institu-
tions are looked up to as an example
for the entire world. Jefferson’s empha-
sis on order and decency is just as im-
portant today is it was more than 200
years ago.
Unfortunately, that was not the case
today.
Madam Speaker, today is a day that
historians will write about. It is a sad
day for this House, the people’s House.
Our rules of order and decency were
broken today, and worse, the House
just voted to condone this violation of
decorum.
Madam Speaker, I know there is frus-
tration in this body. But it is our duty
to focus not on retribution but on
building a more perfect union.
We can be doing so much more, and
we should be doing so much better.
Madam Speaker, I would ask that all
Members take it upon themselves to
uphold the dignity of this institution.
Let us preserve and promote those
ideals of order and decency that this
body was founded upon and that this
body will need if we are to address the
many challenges facing our Nation.
Madam Speaker, it is not just our
Nation that is watching; the world is
watching us. I hope we can rise to the
occasion.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. BASS), who is a
distinguished member of the Judiciary
Committee.
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, the
world is watching, and the world is in
shock.
Today I rise to speak in support of
this resolution condemning the hateful
rhetoric of Donald Trump. His com-
ments were beneath the dignity of the
Office of President of the United
States, and they have no place in our
country.
My four colleagues he attacked have
every right to be in the United States.
They are just as American as any one
of us, and it is shameful that the leader
of our country would seek to disparage
them for political gain. But the sad
truth is that if we were to pass a reso-
lution every time Donald Trump were
to say something offensive, little else
would happen in Congress.
For that reason this moment has to
be about much more than condemning

Donald Trump. This moment has to be
about moving our country back toward
its best values and ensuring that every
American, regardless of origin, race, or
sex, has an opportunity to succeed.
The American people want to see us
fighting for jobs, healthcare, free elec-
tions, and policies that recognize the
humanity of all who seek refuge in our
Nation.
As chair of the Congressional Black
Caucus, I remember when the Presi-
dent said to Black America: What do
you have to lose?
When the leader of this Nation at-
tacks two of our Members—two of the
four women are members of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus—what we have
lost is a President who has dignity.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
DEGETTE). The time of the gentle-
woman has expired.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I yield the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia an additional 15 seconds.
Ms. BASS. Someone who has the ca-
pacity to bring our country together is
what we have lost. But even for this
President, this is a new low: using
rhetoric against someone of a different
race based on the belief that one’s race
is superior. Since the President will
not lead, we must.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my
time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair will—in case anybody forgot—re-
mind everyone in this House on both
sides of the aisle that the rules will be
strictly enforced for the remainder of
this debate. Members are advised to
think closely about their words par-
ticularly when referring to personal-
ities.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
New York (Mr. JEFFRIES), who is the
distinguished Democratic chair of the
Democratic Caucus of the House.
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, our
diversity is a strength; it is not a
weakness. We are a nation of immi-
grants, some voluntary, others invol-
untary, but as Dr. King once observed,
‘‘We may have all come on different
ships, but we’re in the same boat now.’’
We are a gorgeous mosaic of people
from throughout the world. We are
White, we are Black, we are Latino, we
are Asian, and we are Native American.
We are Christian, we are Jewish, we are
Muslim, we are Hindu, we are believers,
and we are nonbelievers. We are gay,
we are straight, we are young, we are
older, we are women, and we are men.
We are citizens, and we are Dreamers.
Out of many we are one. That is what
makes America a great country. No
matter what xenophobic behavior is
coming out of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave-
nue, we will never let anyone take that
away from us—not now, not ever.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my
time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentleman from California (Mr.
SWALWELL).
Mr. SWALWELL of California.
Madam Speaker, we have an oppor-
tunity today to condemn or condone.
Birtherism is racist. Saying a Mexican
judge can’t be fair because of his herit-
age is racist. Saying immigrants from
Mexico are rapists is racist. Saying
there were good people on both sides in
Charlottesville is racist. Calling Afri-
can countries * * * countries is racist,
and telling four Members of this body
to go home is racist.
POINT OF ORDER
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, point of order.
Madam Speaker, I move to take down
words.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will suspend.
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Do
you think it is not racist?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his point of order.
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Do
you think it is not racist, Mr. COLLINS?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will suspend.
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Is
that what you are saying right now,
Mr. COLLINS?
Mr. COLLINS, is it not racist to say
these things?
Because you can say that right now.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California is out of order.
The gentleman from California shall
suspend.
For what purpose does the gentleman
from Georgia rise?
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I make a point of order that
the gentleman’s words are unparlia-
mentary, and I insist they be taken
down.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the words.
b 1800
Mr. SWALWELL of California.
Madam Speaker, I will withdraw an of-
fensive word.
Madam Speaker, may I have an addi-
tional 30 seconds?
Ms. JACKSON LEE. The gentleman
from California has 30 seconds.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Texas controls the
time. The gentleman has 30 seconds re-
maining. Does the gentlewoman wish
to grant him an additional 30 seconds?
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I yield an additional 30 seconds to the
gentleman from California (Mr.
SWALWELL).
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I now withdraw my point of
order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia withdraws his
point of order.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. SWALWELL of California.
Madam Speaker, we have an oppor-
tunity today to condemn or condone.
Birtherism is racist.
Saying a Mexican judge cannot be
fair because of his heritage is racist.
Saying immigrants from Mexico are
rapists is racist.
Telling four Members of this body to
go home because of where you believe
they are from is racist.
There is racism coming out of the
White House. There is racism coming
out of the White House. So where will
you stand today?
That is the question we face: Where
will we stand? Will we stop and extin-
guish the flames of racism from the
White House or will we continue to fan
them?
History and our children are watch-
ing.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield as much time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE).
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, the
last vote that we just saw on the House
floor is beneath the dignity of the
House.
We have rules for a reason. Just be-
cause one party is in the majority,
Madam Speaker, doesn’t mean that the
rules don’t apply to them. The rules
apply to all of us. Just as we are pass-
ing laws here, that ought to apply to
all people fairly across this country.
The reason we have these rules is so
that we can rise above the fray.
We have disagreements on this floor.
What is great about this country is we
have the ability to come and battle
over the disagreements, but we
shouldn’t get into personality conflicts
on this floor. We shouldn’t be trying to
accuse people of one thing or another,
disparagingly, on this floor.
That is why we have these rules, so
that we can actually debate the issues
that people care about rather than en-
gaging in this constant barrage of per-
sonality attacks that we have seen
week after week after week.
The American people expect us to be
spending our time up here fighting for
the issues they care about. They want
us to be spending time focusing on low-
ering their prescription drug prices,
lowering healthcare prices, rather than
this foolishness. They want us to be
solving the crisis at the border, not ig-
noring it, not disparaging it, but actu-
ally focusing on solving it.
These are easy issues for us to solve
if we come together and spend real
time in good faith working on them,
rather than this foolishness.
Look at all of the other problems
that our country faces, that people call
on us to address. They expect that we
are spending our time up here focusing
on those problems, getting our econ-
omy back on track like it is now. It
took people working together, and it is
working.
We can do more.
Fighting the evils across this world,
when you look at what Russia is doing,
when you look at what Iran is doing,
when you look at what China is doing,
us to be coming together, standing up
and working on those problems for the
people who sent us here, not worried
about ourselves, not fighting amongst

ourselves, but actually focusing on

people, not just selectively to some.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentleman from California (Mr. TED
LIEU).
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam
Speaker, I am an immigrant; I am a
person of faith; and I served on Active
Duty in the United States military be-
cause I love America.
Yet, throughout my life, I have had
people tell me to go back to China or
Japan or North Korea. And like many
immigrants, when I get that ‘‘go back’’
insult, it is hateful. It makes me feel
like I don’t belong here in this country.
And make no mistake, when people
tell me to go back where I came from,
that is a racist insult that is based on
race. If I were White, they would not
tell me to go back to China. I experi-
ence that insult because my race hap-
pens to be Asian.
But the good news is that Americans,
at record high levels, support immi-
grants. We are not going anywhere.
America is our home. And I will still be
standing here long after the occupant
of the White House leaves.
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair will remind all persons in the
gallery that they are here as guests of
the House and that any manifestation
of approval or disapproval of pro-
ceedings is in violation of the rules of
the House.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my
time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentlewoman from Washington State
(Ms. JAYAPAL).
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I am
appalled at the statements coming
from the White House telling people
who dissent that somehow you should
go back to your country if you criticize
the United States. Well, let me remind
you that dissent is patriotic and, in
fact, a core value to our democracy, en-
shrined in our Constitution.
And, yes, I am a proud naturalized
citizen born in India, a proud patriot, a
proud person who belongs in this coun-
try.
And it is not the first time I have
heard, ‘‘go back to your own country,’’
but it is the first time I have heard it
coming from the White House. And,
frankly, Madam Speaker, I am appalled
that, on this floor, my Republican col-
leagues would call any of us anti-Amer-
ican.
That is why this vote is so impor-
tant, because we have to let the rest of
the country know that the House of
Representatives will stand up for the
Constitution, represent and defend
every single person in the country, re-
gardless of the color of their skin or
the country of their birth.
Madam Speaker, my Republican col-
leagues have been talking about patri-
otism, about love of country. One of
them said ‘‘love it or leave it.’’ But
what is love if not to make what we
love better through our critique, our
work, and our service. That is what
real Americans do.
We do not stifle dissent. We do not
otherize or sow hatred, and we cer-
tainly never say ‘‘go back to your
country’’ to a brown or a Black person,
because that is a racist trope.
I hope that every single Member of
this Chamber, Republican and Demo-
crat, will join me in rejecting the
President’s message and vote in sup-
port of this resolution. Madam Speak-
er, that is the American thing to do.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my
time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.
DEAN).
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, words
matter. Decency matters.
Recently, President Trump told four
Congresswomen of color to ‘‘go back’’
to their home countries.
Mr. President, they are home.
Three of these Congresswomen, my
colleagues, were born in the United
States. The fourth, also my colleague,
is a naturalized U.S. citizen. They are
as American as I am, as the President
is, as the First Lady is or anyone else,
period.
Telling people who look different to
go back to where they came from is a
refrain laced with hate. This rhetoric is
neither new nor a surprise, but that
doesn’t mean we can allow it to stand.
And it belies a fundamental misunder-
standing of our Nation’s promise, that
we are all created equal and that ev-
eryone has a role to play in building a
more perfect Union—not just White
Americans, every American.
We hereby recognize these words for
what they are: offensive, hateful. And
the people we represent deserve better.
As a cosponsor, I believe we must call
out hate wherever we see it, whether in
our own houses or in the White House.
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members
to support the resolution. Words mat-
ter.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my
time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. LEWIS).
Mr. LEWIS. Madam Speaker, I rise
with a sense of righteous indignation
to support this resolution.
I know racism when I see it. I know
racism when I feel it. And at the high-
est level of government, there is no
room for racism. It sows the seeds of
violence and destroys the hopes and
dreams of people.
The world is watching. They are
shocked and dismayed because it seems
we have lost our way as a nation, as a
proud and great people. We are one
Congress, and we are here to serve one
House: the American House, the Amer-
ican people.
Some of us have been victims of the
stain, the pain, and the hurt of racism.
In the 1950s and during the 1960s, seg-
regationists told us to go back when we
protested for our rights. They told
ministers, priests, rabbis, and nuns to
go back. They told the innocent little
children seeking just an equal edu-
cation to go back.
As a nation and as a people, we need
to go forward and not backwards.
With this vote, we stand with our sis-
ters. Three were born in America, and
one came here looking for a better life.
With this vote, we meet our moral
obligations to condemn hate, racism,
and bigotry in every form.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding me the time. Let’s
do what is right, what is fair, and what
is just.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my
time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN).
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, ‘‘we the
people,’’ ‘‘a more perfect Union,’’ ‘‘the
common defense,’’ ‘‘general welfare,’’
‘‘common good,’’ ‘‘these United
States’’—the words and phrases of our
founding documents were about unity,
were about us coming together against
the political and economic concentra-
tion of power.
Division is the enemy in the United
States today. We are unraveling before
the very eyes of the American people.
And I believe that this President, that
the White House does not want to talk
about the issues facing the American
people today.
Madam Speaker, 75 percent of the
American people are living paycheck
to paycheck; seniors are paying $1,000 a
month for prescription drugs; students
are drowning in student loans.
b 1815
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of
my time.
Madam Speaker, I will not belabor
this. I have made many of the points
that I have said before. I think this was
rushed to the floor. I think this is what
happens, unfortunately, when things
are rushed.
There are things that need to be
done, and the decorum of this House is
important. We have had a long lesson
of that today.
The very essence of the resolution,
which has issues beyond, needs to be
considered. When we do this, then I
think, as I said in my opening—and I
will stick by what I said then—this
needs to be voted down. This does not
need to go forward.
We need to get to a certain time
when we are back to, literally, doing
the people’s business. This is the third
time, Madam Speaker, that I have been
on the floor doing this—third time—
more time than I have done on immi-
gration, more time than I have done on
any other bills, bills that could actu-
ally get signed into law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5856 July 16, 2019
As my whip said a few moments ago,
there are things we could sit down and
find common ground on, but it seems
like common ground is gone.
There are some of us willing to reach
our hands across the aisle and say,
‘‘Let’s find common ground because
people are hurting. Why don’t we solve
those?’’ Instead, we continue, seem-
ingly, to want to continue to go to the
press release or to the political state-
ment, which is frustrating. I under-
stand, but we have to get better.
We have to look at this and ask:
What happens to the American people?
What happens to the people who sent
us here, who are looking at this and
asking what they need to do to make
their lives better, not the lives in this
body?
When we understand that, that is
when we come together. That is when
we take the decorum of this House.
That is when we find ways to speak to
each other as friends who have been
elected to serve a common purpose.
That is our higher aim. When we deni-
grate that, we are not being honest
with ourselves.
Let’s get to the people’s business.
There are budget issues looming. There
are caps looming. There is a debt ceil-
ing looming. There are still problems
at our border, which is a crisis. These
need to be fixed.
Let’s take up those bills. Let’s have
honest debate. I will put a bill up; you
put a bill up. Let’s do what we are sup-
posed to do here, have markups, run
things through committee. Let’s take
seriously what we said to do.
We both, at times, as parties, have
been guilty of not doing that. Let’s
focus now—at least where we are now—
and say this is not the way forward and
this is not where we need to be because
of the many problems inherent in the
resolution itself but, also, the way it
was brought to us. We have seen that
play out on the floor today.
Is that really how we are going to
leave it with the American people, that
rules can be broken and then nothing is
done about it? Is that really where we
are going to be, that we are not going
to bring issues to the floor that can be
discussed, that have been brought
through committee, that actually af-
fect people’s lives?
That is the frustration I have,
Madam Speaker.
Time for debate on this needs to be
done. We need to vote ‘‘no.’’ We need to
move forward.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, the way to move
forward is by voting ‘‘yes’’ on the un-
derlying resolution.
To paraphrase the Declaration of
Independence, it is indicated that we
all are created equal, with certain
unalienable rights of life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness.
That is immigrant and non-
immigrant. That is an individual whose
religion you believe in and one you do
not. That is a lifestyle that you may
not know and understand. It may be a
race or ethnicity that you have never
come to be able to accept.
In this Nation, the founding Thirteen
Colonies fleeing persecution were de-
scribed as creating an experiment. It
was not a perfect experiment.
There were some of us who came to
this Nation in the bottom of the belly
of a slave boat. There were some who
were indentured servants. Many came
by boat. Some walked across a border
that has created havoc. But they were
people desperate for freedom and the
right to make their lives better.
We can account for those people by
the history books and the decades of
heroes and sheroes who have come in a
different skin, a different religion, a
different basis. They have even put on
the uniform of this Nation because
they love this country.
I am reminded of the era of Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King, the many miles he
walked with the soldiers, the Civil
Rights soldiers, and his early book ti-
tled ‘‘Why We Can’t Wait.’’
I join with the idea that we must
work for the American people. We must
provide for the increase in the min-
imum wage, good healthcare, and edu-
cation.
At the same time, there is something
in this Nation that our children de-
mand that we do. What are the values
of the red, white, and blue? What are
the values of those stars that represent
the many States of this Nation? The
values are that we are a Nation based
upon laws, morality, values, a love of
country, due process, equality, and jus-
tice. It means that every single person
must have the fundamental right of re-
spect.
This resolution is simply that. It is a
fundamental right to respect and dig-
nity—in this instance, for four Mem-
bers of the United States Congress
from Boston, from New York, from
Minnesota, and from Michigan.
As they go on to their places, it is
very clear that they must have the re-
spect that is deserving of this par-
ticular Congress.
These four women are no less deserv-
ing of dignity than anyone else. This
resolution is simply one that is to
seek—not condoning, as was said—a
condemnation of attitudes that may
parlay racist beliefs.
No one stands for that. We cannot go
on to all that is good without saying to
the Nation and the world that this is
not good; it is not America; and we will
not accept that as our definition be-
cause we do believe in the creation of a
more perfect Union.
I conclude by saying that we con-
demn the hurtful and offensive com-
ments that demean immigrants and
people of color, especially if those com-
ments originate from the White House.
What we will do today is accept the
challenge of Dr. Martin Luther King, a
peacemaker, a man of hope, and we will
say why we can’t wait because the Na-
tion calls upon our higher angels.
That is what we will do when we af-
firm this resolution on behalf of the
people of the United States of America.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues
to vote for this very important resolu-
tion, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speaker,
today, with this resolution, the House con-
tinues the fight for equality and dignity for
every person.
It’s not important to us where you came
from. It only matters that you’re here now.
Sin embargo vamos a luchar por la
igualidad y la dignidad de cada persona.
No es importante para nosotros de dónde
vienes. Sólo nos importa que estés aquı́
ahora.
When I was Harris County Commissioner, I
was told, ‘‘Go back to Mexico and crawl back
under the rock you came from.’’
When we were debating the anti-immigrant
racial profiling bill SB 4 in the Texas Senate,
I received a call. ‘‘I’ve got guns. Lots of guns,’’
the man said. But this credible death threat
didn’t stop us.
An attack on one of us is an attack on all
of us as Americans.
Un ataque contra uno es un ataque contra
todos como Americanos.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise to
condemn the racist statements made by the
president of the United States against my col-
leagues here in Congress.
Our nation is a beacon of hope to the world,
a nation where people arrive with the goal of
embracing the American dream. They and
their children make vital economic, edu-
cational, civic, and social contributions to the
American fabric—they become business own-
ers, doctors, and even members of Congress.
It is clear that the diversity that this country
provides is not our problem, it is our promise.
Although the president has indicated that
there are ‘‘many people [who] agree with’’ his
comments, I, and many Americans, were dis-
appointed that the individual who acts as our
representative on the world stage would share
these racist sentiments. I have confidence that
the beliefs reflected in the president’s state-
ments are not held by the American people as
a whole and do not reflect who we are as a
nation.
This country has endured too many obsta-
cles and undergone too many lessons learned
to accept these offensive statements. We
have endured slavery, forced displacement,
Jim Crow laws, and internment camps. We
are still working to fight against redlining, voter
intimidation, hate crimes, and mass incarcer-
ation. Our country deserves better than this.
The world deserves better than this.
Americans yearn for a day when we are not
fighting each other but are fighting towards a
common mission to continually improve our
great nation as the United States of America.
This is why my colleagues and I are com-
mitted to fulfilling this agenda. We are working
to lower drug prices, we are working to restore
voting rights for every American, we are work-
ing to eliminate the opioid epidemic, and we
are committed to ensuring that we find solu-
tions to the problems in our criminal justice
system.
Let me be clear, these words should have
no place in the dialogue of our United States
of America.
That is why I am a proud cosponsor of H.

NOTICE OF INTENTION TO OFFER
RESOLUTION RAISING A QUES-
TION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF
THE HOUSE
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX,
I rise to give notice of my intention to
raise a question of the privileges of the
House.
The form of the resolution is as fol-
lows:
Impeaching Donald John Trump,
President of the United States, of high
misdemeanors.
Resolved, that Donald John Trump,
President of the United States, is unfit
to be President, unfit to represent the
American values of decency and moral-
ity, respectability and civility, honesty
and propriety, reputability and integ-
rity, is unfit to defend the ideals that
have made America great, unfit to de-
fend liberty and justice for all as
extolled in the Pledge of Allegiance, is
unfit to defend the American ideal of
all persons being created equal as ex-
alted in the Declaration of Independ-
ence, is unfit to ensure domestic tran-
quility, promote the general welfare
and to ensure the blessings of liberty
to ourselves and our posterity as
lauded in the preamble to the United
States Constitution, is unfit to protect
the government of the people, by the
people, for the people as elucidated in
the Gettysburg Address, and is im-
peached for high misdemeanors that
the following Article of Impeachment
be exhibited to the Senate:
Article of Impeachment exhibited by
the House of Representatives of the
United States, in the name of itself, of
the people of the United States,
against Donald John Trump, President
of the United States, in maintenance
and support of its impeachment
against him for high misdemeanors
committed as President constituting
harm to American society to the mani-
fest injury of the people of the United
States:
Article I.
The House of Representatives on
July 16, 2019, strongly condemned
President Donald Trump’s racist com-
ments that have legitimized and in-
creased fear and hatred of new Ameri-
cans and people of color by saying that
our fellow Americans who are immi-
grants, and those who may look to the
President like immigrants, should ‘‘go
back’’ to other countries, by referring
to immigrants and asylum seekers as
‘‘invaders,’’ and by saying that Mem-
bers of Congress who are immigrants,
or those of our colleagues who are
wrongly assumed to be immigrants, do
not belong in Congress or in the United
States of America.
In all of this, the aforementioned
Donald John Trump has, by his state-
ments, brought the high office of the
President of the United States in con-
tempt, ridicule, disgrace, and disre-
pute, has sown seeds of discord among
the people of the United States, has
demonstrated that he is unfit to be
President, and has betrayed his trust

as President of the United States to
the manifest injury of the people of the
United States, and has committed a
high misdemeanor in office.
Therefore, Donald John Trump by
causing such harm to the society of the
United States is unfit to be President
and warrants impeachment, trial, and
removal from office.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
rule IX, a resolution offered from the
floor by a Member other than the ma-
jority leader or the minority leader as
a question of the privileges of the
House has immediate precedence only
at a time designated by the Chair with-
in 2 legislative days after the resolu-
tion is properly noticed.
Pending that designation, the form of
the resolution noticed by the gen-
tleman from Texas will appear in the
RECORD at this point.
The Chair will not at this point de-
termine whether the resolution con-
stitutes a question of privilege. That
determination will be made at the time
designated for consideration of the res-
olution.

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
consideration of the bill (H.R. 3494) to
authorize appropriations for fiscal year
2020 for intelligence and intelligence-
related activities of the United States
Government, the Community Manage-
ment Account, and the Central Intel-
ligence Agency Retirement and Dis-
ability System, and for other purposes,
with Mr. HUFFMAN in the chair.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the
bill is considered read the first time.
General debate shall be confined to
the bill and amendments specified in
the first section of House Resolution
491, and shall not exceed 1 hour equally
divided and controlled by the chair and
ranking minority member of the Per-
manent Select Committee on Intel-
ligence.
The gentleman from California (Mr.
SCHIFF) and the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. NUNES) each will control 30
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California (Mr. SCHIFF).
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself as much time as I may con-
sume.
Along the wall in the upper lobby of
the CIA headquarters building is a
large picture of the head and torch of
the Statue of Liberty accompanied by
the following words: ‘‘We are the Na-
tion’s first line of defense. We accom-
plish what others cannot accomplish
and go where others cannot go.’’
These two sentences distill the es-
sence of America’s intelligence com-
munity and the quiet sense of mission
that tens of thousands of our fellow
citizens bring to their jobs every day.
H.R. 3494, the Damon Paul Nelson
and Matthew Young Pollard Intel-
ligence Authorization Act for Fiscal
Years 2018, 2019, and 2020, is our con-
tribution to the work of the IC.
This is a bipartisan bill, reported
unanimously out of the Intelligence
Committee and embodying the collec-
tive efforts of Democratic and Repub-
lican members.
Though H.R. 3494 contains many new
initiatives authored during my chair-
manship, it also preserves provisions
developed during Ranking Member
NUNES’ tenure as chairman as well.
Despite disagreements over the Rus-
sia investigation, the committee has
come together to support our intel-
ligence community.
HPSCI oversees highly sensitive,
highly classified activities, and we col-
laborate with the IC to ensure that it
has the resources and authorities nec-
essary to collect vital intelligence.
That won’t work, however, unless the
committee trusts the IC elements it
oversees, and those same elements
trust the committee.
At the same time, HPSCI must en-
sure that legal and policy constraints
are vigorously enforced. That requires
us to maintain both a professional dis-
tance and a healthy skepticism about
the activities we oversee. When war-
ranted, the committee must impose ad-
ditional checks and limitations, at
times over intelligence community ob-
jections.
It is a delicate balance, which HPSCI
strikes through use of many different
oversight tools. The most important by
far is our annual Intelligence Author-
ization Act.
H.R. 3494 gets the balance right. It
authorizes funding for the IC at rough-
ly 1.4 percent above the President’s
budget request for the coming year. It
prioritizes the IC’s collection and ana-
lytic capabilities against China, Rus-
sia, Iran, and North Korea, while sus-
taining critical intelligence capabili-
ties that support counterterrorism and
counterproliferation.
The bill also ensures that the men
and women of the IC have what they
need to collect and analyze the intel-
ligence that policymakers require.
At the same time, H.R. 3494 ensures
close oversight by Congress, rejecting
the funding of legacy IC programs with
overseas contingency operation re-
sources, or OCO, funding; and requir-
ing, for the first time, the submission
to the intelligence committees of de-
tailed information on unfunded IC pro-
grams.
Another provision authored by Rep-
resentative WELCH calls for more infor-
mation in the IC’s budget for counter-
terrorism matters to be released to the
public consistent with the protection
of national security. Still another au-
thorizes the Public Interest Declas-
sification Board, which plays a vital
role in ensuring that historical docu-
ments about IC programs are declas-
sified appropriately.
The legislation is especially strong in
three other areas. The first has to do
with foreign malign activities, includ-
ing those by Russia. The bill calls for
extensive IC reporting and creates new
notification requirements regarding
covert or overt efforts by foreign gov-
ernments to undermine trusted institu-
tions or to interfere in the democratic
process, our own or those of other na-
tions.
This bill also strongly supports the
IC workforce. H.R. 3494 obliges the IC
elements to offer their employees 12
weeks of paid parental leave on top of
the unpaid leave already guaranteed to
them by law. Other language ensures
that the families of CIA personnel who
are killed or injured as a result of wars,
hostile acts, or other incidents can be
appropriately compensated.
The bill also bolsters the IC’s ability
to recruit, hire, retain, and promote a
workforce that represents the diversity
of the Nation that it serves.
Lastly, technology. Many have
sounded alarms about the rise of so-
called ‘‘deep fake’’ algorithms and the
transition in our country and else-
where to a fifth-generation tele-
communications network. To help the
IC address both challenges, H.R. 3494
instructs the DNI to hold competitions
and to award prizes for cutting-edge re-
search into deep fake and 5G tech-
nologies.
H.R. 3494 is not perfect; it is the re-
sult of negotiation and compromise. I
am pleased that, despite our public dif-
ferences, we have once again been able
to put those aside to focus on the im-
portant work of overseeing the intel-
ligence community. The result is a
strong, bipartisan bill, which I am
proud to support.
Mr. Chair, let me conclude by thank-
ing Ranking Member NUNES, my com-
mittee colleagues, and the entire
HPSCI staff for their collaborative ef-
forts.
Mr. Chair, I urge all Members of the
House to join me in voting for H.R.
3494.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5859
July 16, 2019
Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support
of H.R. 3494, the Damon Paul Nelson
and Matthew Young Pollard Intel-
ligence Authorization Act for Fiscal
Years 2018, 2019, and 2020.
Passing an annual intelligence au-
thorization bill is the most important
tool Congress has to conduct effective
oversight of the intelligence activities
of the United States.
Today, Chairman SCHIFF and I are
bringing the tenth consecutive intel-
ligence authorization bill to the floor. I
am pleased that, as in years past, this
bill is a bipartisan product that re-
flects the contributions of all the com-
mittee’s members. It was reported out
of the committee by a unanimous voice
vote.
This legislation is the product of bi-
partisan work by the majority and the
minority and provides the intelligence
community the necessary resources
and authorities to ensure the IC re-
mains capable of protecting and de-
fending the United States.
The bill folds in many priorities from
fiscal year 2018 and 2019, including the
defense of elections from foreign
threats, enhanced injury benefits to
CIA employees, and bolsters intel-
ligence oversight by improving the IC
accountability to Congress.
Additionally, the bill protects all CIA
covert intelligence officers’ identities,
establishes a paid parental leave pro-
gram for the IC, and it mandates coun-
terintelligence briefings and notifica-
tions to the intelligence committees by
the FBI on a quarterly basis and
prompt notification when an investiga-
tion is carried out regarding a counter-
intelligence risk related to a Federal
election or campaign.
This bill supports critical national
security programs, particularly those
focused on countering threats from
hard targets, such as China.
Lastly, the bill continues to ensure
that the dedicated men and women of
our intelligence community have the
funding, authorities, and support they
need to carry out their mission and to
keep us safe.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I am
proud to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY).
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
I rise in support of H.R. 3494.
As the United States learned in 2016,
there are few things more important to
our democracy than ensuring that our
electoral system is kept free from out-
side interference.
We also have a responsibility to edu-
cate our partners and our allies about
the threat from foreign interference, as
well as share our best practices with
those nations that face similar threats.
Taiwan, one of Asia’s most vibrant
democracies, is acutely aware of the
risks posed by foreign influence. The
Chinese Communist Party, angry that
another nation has the audacity to
prove that a culturally Chinese democ-
racy can thrive, will stop at nothing to
degrade Taiwan’s political independ-
ence.
This year’s Intelligence Authoriza-
tion Act requires the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence to report on influ-
ence operations China conducts to
interfere in Taiwan’s upcoming 2020
elections and find out what assistance
the U.S. government provided to
counter these operations and provide a
comprehensive list of the specific orga-
nizations that conducted these influ-
ence operations.
The U.S. is in a unique position to
share the tools and techniques with
others that we are implementing to
safeguard our own democratic elec-
tions.
In line with our obligations under the
Taiwan Relations Act, we urge the ad-
ministration to do all it can to assist
Taipei with creating conditions for a
free, fair, and secure election that is
free from interference.
This provision brings us one step
closer to that goal.
Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chairman, I yield as
much time as she may consume to the
gentlewoman from New York (Ms.
STEFANIK).
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chair, I am
proud to rise in support of this year’s
Intelligence Authorization Act.
After the recent partisan NDAA de-
bate and vote, it is an accomplishment
that this committee came together to
produce a bipartisan bill that supports
our intelligence community and pro-
vides the warfighter with the intel-
ligence support needed to protect the
United States and our allies.
I am particularly pleased that this
bill contains the Counterintelligence
Accountability Act that I introduced
earlier this year that I wanted to take
a moment to highlight for the Amer-
ican public.
This bill amends the National Secu-
rity Act by requiring the FBI to pro-
vide quarterly counterintelligence
briefings to the congressional intel-
ligence committees, which is not only
necessary for us to conduct meaningful
oversight over the FBI’s counterintel-
ligence operations, but also provides
the American people with the comfort
that the FBI is subject to the same
types of scrutiny as other intelligence
agencies.
Importantly, this bill also mandates
that the FBI notify the congressional
intelligence committees when the FBI
has a counterintelligence investigation
open related to a CI risk to an election
or campaign for Federal office.
Given former FBI Director Comey’s
testimony in 2017, I am still deeply
concerned that the FBI failed to pro-
vide notification to the congressional
intelligence committees regarding the
investigation opened into the Trump
campaign in 2016 until well after the
election.
This bill ensures that Congress is
kept fully and currently informed of
these types of counterintelligence ac-
tivities. This is good, accountable gov-
ernance.
Mr. Chair, I appreciate the chair and
ranking member’s support in adding
my legislation into this bill and urge
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on final
passage.
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I am
proud to yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Washington State (Mr.
HECK).
Mr. HECK. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the chair of the committee for yield-
ing.
Mr. Chair, I rise to strongly support
the David Paul Nelson and Matthew
Young Pollard Intelligence Authoriza-
tion Act.
In the last year we have made some
pretty incredible progress in reducing
the security clearance backlog, yet,
frankly, after all the progress we have
made, we are still—and you are hearing
this number correctly—left with nearly
a half a million people on the waiting
list for security clearance.
Earlier this year, the average wait
time for top secret security clearance
was reduced to 468 days, down from 534
days.
So, in other words, when we are out
there competing for young talent to
come in and be a member of the intel-
ligence community, say in a field such
as cyber, we are told we have to tell
them, ‘‘Cool your jets. We will get back
to you in a year, year and a half or so.’’
Indeed, closer to home, my senior
military adviser is a distinguished
graduate of the United States Military
Academy at West Point. He served not
one, but two tours in Afghanistan,
where he had a security clearance, and
yet when he joined a staff in the House
of Representatives, to again earn a se-
curity clearance, it took 20 months,
nearly 2 years.
We are losing good people when we
subject them to that long of a wait
time.
This bill makes some progress. It will
build on the progress we made this
year by providing needed reform to this
mission. It creates a system of ac-
countability and clear goals for how
the process should run.
Furthermore, the bill allows for inno-
vation on using digital tools, and reci-
procity among agencies to improve our
efficiencies when clearances are needed
to be transferred from one agency to
another.
Our government can and must effi-
ciently and effectively review security
clearance applicants. We owe our na-
tional security workforce at least that
much. This bill will help us to do that,
to further reduce it, so that the intel-
ligence community can compete for
the best and the brightest in a timely
fashion.
Mr. Chair, for that reason, among
many, I urge Members’ support for the
Intelligence Authorization Act.

Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chairman, I reserve

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5860 July 16, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ala-
bama (Ms. SEWELL).
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise in support of H.R. 3494, the
Intelligence Authorization Act.
Mr. Chairman, as the chair of the De-
fense Intelligence and Warfighter Sup-
port Subcommittee, I believe this bill
will ensure our warfighters retain the
information and decisionmaking ad-
vantages to which we have grown ac-
customed and improve the intelligence
community’s ability to attract and re-
tain a diverse workforce.
The bill includes provisions that au-
thorize increased intelligence funding
for combatant commanders and our
growing strategic competition with
China, Russia, and other malign actors;
supports the Defense Intelligence
Agency’s ongoing assessment of its
roles and missions; and provides the
Director of National Intelligence with
the necessary authority to manage in-
telligence community-wide academic
programs.
This bill also includes language I au-
thored which will improve Federal
campaign election security. My provi-
sion will require the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence to work with the
FBI and the Department of Homeland
Security to make available an advisory
report on foreign counterintelligence
and cybersecurity threats to those
campaigns. Additionally, my language
requires the Director to publish a sum-
mary of best practices and provide in-
formation to campaigns to help thwart
these attacks.
This legislation also continues the
committee’s longstanding and bipar-
tisan work to promote increased diver-
sity within the intelligence commu-
nity’s workforce. This bill contains
language directing the intelligence
community to expand its annual demo-
graphic hiring report by adding grade
level, years of service, career cat-
egories, gender identity, and sexual
orientation reporting categories. These
changes will improve the IC’s ability to
track how well it retains and promotes
persons of diverse backgrounds.
Finally, for the first time in many
years, the Intelligence Authorization
Act will provide significant funding for
programs that will improve the IC’s
ability to introduce students from di-
verse backgrounds to its mission.
Mr. Chairman, I look forward to vot-
ing in support of this legislation. I
commend the chairman and ranking
member on working together to pro-
vide these important authorizations. I
encourage my colleagues to do the
same and vote for this bill.
Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chairman, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. SWALWELL).
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr.
Chairman, I thank the chairman of our
committee for working with the minor-
ity to put together a bipartisan piece
of legislation that serves our national
security purposes.
I also want to acknowledge both of
the individuals for whom the bill is
named, but particularly Damon Paul
Nelson, the former staff director for
the then-majority at the time, some-
one whom I and my colleagues saw put
his heart and soul into the committee
and someone who was able to keep
many lines of communication that
were necessary open during some of our
most trying times. This is a fitting rec-
ognition of his service to our country.
As chairman of the Intelligence Mod-
ernization and Readiness Sub-
committee, I celebrate this bipartisan
bill and the patriotic young people who
enter service in the intelligence com-
munity, sometimes immediately after
college, despite extraordinary student
debt. For that reason, we have included
measures to enhance intelligence com-
munity-wide student loan repayment
and forgiveness programs.
Reducing the financial burden on in-
telligence community workers helps us
recruit and retain a talented and di-
verse workforce to remain competitive
with the private sector. To that aim,
we have also included a measure to au-
thorize 12 weeks of paid parental leave
for intelligence community employees
in the event of a birth or adoption.
This authority would supplement the
12 weeks of unpaid leave currently af-
forded to intelligence community em-
ployees and other government per-
sonnel under existing law, sending a
strong message to the intelligence
community workforce that they do not
need to choose between their career,
serving our country, and their family.
These will help the intelligence com-
munity recruit and retain individuals
capable of meeting the security goals
of the United States and will set the
example for other Federal agencies
seeking pro-worker policies.
Our goal on the subcommittee is to
anticipate the needs of the intelligence
community workforce. Reaching across
the aisle for our intelligence commu-
nity is how we will secure a next-gen-
eration intelligence community work-
force.
Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chairman, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, it is now
a pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from New York (Mr. SEAN
PATRICK MALONEY).
Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of
New York. Mr. Chairman, I thank the
chairman for yielding.
Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer
support for this bill, which includes my
legislation, the Gregg Wenzel Clandes-
tine Heroes Parity Act.
Mr. Chairman, my bill honors an un-
sung son of the Hudson Valley, CIA Of-
ficer Gregg Wenzel, who died in Ethi-
opia on July 9, 2003. He was only 33
years old.
Gregg was inspired to join the Clan-
destine Service after September 11 and
dedicated his life to making the United
States stronger in our fight against
terrorism. That is what CIA officers do;
they put their lives on the line for our
freedoms. But because of the nature of
their work, they rarely get the recogni-
tion they deserve.
This bill simply ensures that the
families of fallen CIA officers receive
the death benefits their loved ones
earned laying down their lives in serv-
ice of our Nation.
Gregg was born in the Bronx and
graduated from Monroe-Woodbury High
School in Orange County, New York.
He went on to earn degrees from the
State University of New York at Bing-
hamton and then the University of
Miami School of Law.
After joining the CIA, he was as-
signed his first overseas tour as an op-
erations officer in the Horn of Africa.
The assignment was challenging, but
Gregg was known for his grit and good
spirit.
After his death, Gregg was awarded
the CIA’s Intelligence Commendation
Medal and the Exceptional Service Me-
dallion. You can find his star, number
81, on the CIA Memorial Wall in Lang-
ley. And we even honored his service in
2015 by renaming the Monroe, New
York, post office the Gregg David
Wenzel Memorial Post Office, which is
the first such honor ever to be be-
stowed on a CIA officer.
But even with these distinctions,
Gregg’s family was never able to access
the death benefits he had earned in life.
A loophole currently blocks benefits
for all CIA officers who don’t have de-
pendents or who are not killed by a
known act of terrorism. My bill simply
changes that and rights this wrong.
I am so thankful to Gregg’s parents,
Gladys and Mitch Wenzel, for never
giving up on this fight. This bill is an
opportunity for us, as a grateful na-
tion, to honor Gregg and his family and
to honor all of our fallen CIA officers
and the families they have left behind.
Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill.
Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, this year’s IA is
named after Damon Nelson and Mat-
thew Pollard, two staffers who passed
away unexpectedly last year.
Matt Pollard was a staffer with the
Senate Intelligence Committee, and he
is remembered fondly by staff and
members who had the pleasure of work-
ing with him.
Damon Nelson was a former Repub-
lican staff director on the House Intel-
ligence Committee and a personal
friend. Damon would be happy with the
bill today, and I am happy that this
committee was able to produce a bipar-
tisan product.
In closing, I want to take a moment
to thank the men and women who
serve in our intelligence community. I
am honored to get to know so many of
them in the course of the committee’s
oversight work.
I also thank my colleagues on the In-
telligence Committee for their con-
tributions to our oversight over the
past year.

Scott joined the committee in 2016 and,

Mr. Chairman, I wish Scott all the
best as he, his wife, Rebecca, and
daughter, Sarah, return home.
All the staff members spent long

and its classified annex, and the bill is

Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman

Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of H.R.

Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I yield

Mr. Chairman, I wish to say only a
few words of recognition before con-
cluding my remarks on the Intel-
ligence Authorization Act.
First, my HPSCI colleagues and I re-
member HPSCI’s Damon Nelson and
SSCI’s Matthew Pollard, two dedicated
staffers and public servants who passed
away last year. The legislation is
named in their honor.
I also express my tremendous thanks
and support to the men and women of

strive quietly and tirelessly every day,
and their work helps keep the Nation
safe.
I greatly appreciate the work of
Ranking Member NUNES, as well as my
other HPSCI colleagues.
And I would be remiss if I did not rec-
ognize these members of my staff who
worked tirelessly together with their
minority colleagues to produce this bi-

One more personnel note: I want to
recognize the exemplary contributions
of Brandon Smith, who has been a
member of HPSCI’s staff for 18 years.
Brandon has announced that he will be
leaving HPSCI soon. We are deeply
grateful for his work and his long-
standing and continuing service to the
Nation.
Let me conclude by urging all Mem-
bers of the House to join me in voting
for H.R. 3494 and in supporting the

and, after that, to the President’s desk.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-

issue to initiate the process for a security clear-
ance;
(C) digitization of background investigation-

which automated records checks and other con-
tinuous evaluation methods may be used to ex-
pedite or focus reinvestigations; and

materials on individuals collected by the private
sector for background investigation purposes.
(6) Uniform standards for agency continuous
evaluation programs to ensure quality and reci-
procity in accepting enrollment in a continuous
vetting program as a substitute for a periodic in-
vestigation for continued access to classified in-
formation.

the goal that by December 31, 2021, reinvestiga-
tion on a set periodicity is not required for more
than 10 percent of the population that holds a
security clearance.
(d) EQUIVALENT METRICS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—If the Council develops a set
of performance metrics that it certifies to the ap-
propriate congressional committees should
achieve substantially equivalent outcomes as
those outlined in subsections (b) and (c), the

taining access to classified information or eligi-
bility to hold a sensitive position, as applicable.
‘‘(5) Unless otherwise designated by law, to
serve as the final authority to designate a Fed-

H5880 July 16, 2019
(b) REPORT REQUIRED.—Not later than 90
days after the date of the enactment of this Act,
the Security Executive Agent shall submit to the
appropriate congressional committees and make
available to appropriate industry partners a re-
port that describes the requirements, feasibility,
and advisability of implementing a clearance in
person concept described in subsection (c).
(c) CLEARANCE IN PERSON CONCEPT.—The
clearance in person concept—
(1) permits an individual who once held a se-
curity clearance to maintain his or her eligi-
bility for access to classified information, net-
works, and facilities for up to 3 years after the
individual’s eligibility for access to classified in-
formation would otherwise lapse; and
(2) recognizes, unless otherwise directed by
the Security Executive Agent, an individual’s
security clearance and background investigation
as current, regardless of employment status,
contingent on enrollment in a continuous vet-
ting program.
(d) CONTENTS.—The report required under
subsection (b) shall address—
(1) requirements for an individual to volun-
tarily remain in a continuous evaluation pro-
gram validated by the Security Executive Agent
even if the individual is not in a position requir-
ing access to classified information;
(2) appropriate safeguards for privacy;
(3) advantages to government and industry;
(4) the costs and savings associated with im-
plementation;
(5) the risks of such implementation, including
security and counterintelligence risks;
(6) an appropriate funding model; and
(7) fairness to small companies and inde-
pendent contractors.
SEC. 2608. REPORTS ON RECIPROCITY FOR SECU-
RITY CLEARANCES INSIDE OF DE-
PARTMENTS AND AGENCIES.
(a) RECIPROCALLY RECOGNIZED DEFINED.—In
this section, the term ‘‘reciprocally recognized’’
means reciprocal recognition by Federal depart-
ments and agencies of eligibility for access to
classified information.
(b) REPORTS TO SECURITY EXECUTIVE
AGENT.—The head of each Federal department
or agency shall submit an annual report to the
Security Executive Agent that—
(1) identifies the number of individuals whose
security clearances take more than 2 weeks to be
reciprocally recognized after such individuals
move to another part of such department or
agency; and
(2) breaks out the information described in
paragraph (1) by type of clearance and the rea-
sons for any delays.
(c) ANNUAL REPORT.—Not less frequently than
once each year, the Security Executive Agent
shall submit to the appropriate congressional
committees and make available to industry part-
ners an annual report that summarizes the in-
formation received pursuant to subsection (b)
during the period covered by such report.
SEC. 2609. INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY REPORTS
ON SECURITY CLEARANCES.
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) despite sustained efforts by Congress and
the executive branch, an unacceptable backlog
in processing and adjudicating security clear-
ances persists, both within elements of the intel-
ligence community and in other departments of
the Federal Government, with some processing
times exceeding a year or even more;
(2) the protracted clearance timetable threat-
ens the ability of elements of the intelligence
community to hire and retain highly qualified
individuals, and thus to fulfill the missions of
such elements;
(3) the prospect of a lengthy clearance process
deters some such individuals from seeking em-
ployment with the intelligence community in the
first place, and, when faced with a long wait
time, those with conditional offers of employ-
ment may opt to discontinue the security clear-
ance process and pursue different opportunities;
(4) now more than ever, therefore, the broken
security clearance process badly needs funda-
mental reform; and
(5) in the meantime, to ensure the ability of
elements of the intelligence community to hire
and retain highly qualified personnel, elements
should consider, to the extent possible and con-
sistent with national security, permitting new
employees to enter on duty immediately or near-
ly so, and to perform, on a temporary basis
pending final adjudication of their security
clearances, work that either does not require a
security clearance or requires only a low-level
interim clearance.
(b) IN GENERAL.—Section 506H of the National
Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3104) is amend-
ed—
(1) in subsection (a)(1)—
(A) in subparagraph (A)(ii), by inserting
‘‘and’’ after the semicolon;
(B) in subparagraph (B)(ii), by striking ‘‘;
and’’ and inserting a period; and
(C) by striking subparagraph (C);
(2) by redesignating subsection (b) as sub-
section (c);
(3) by inserting after subsection (a) the fol-
lowing new subsection (b):
‘‘(b) INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY REPORTS.—(1)
Not later than March 1 of each year, the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence shall submit to the
congressional intelligence committees, the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security and Governmental

AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR. STEWART
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 1 printed in part
B of House Report 116–154.
Mr. STEWART. Mr. Chairman, as the
designee of the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. BURGESS), I have an amendment
at the desk.
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate
the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 224, line 15, insert ‘‘the Committee on
Energy and Commerce,’’ after ‘‘Armed Serv-
ices,’’.
Page 224, line 19, insert ‘‘the Committee on
Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions,’’
after ‘‘Armed Services,’’.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 491, the gentleman from Utah
(Mr. STEWART) and a Member opposed
each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Utah.
Mr. STEWART. Mr. Chairman, my
amendment is very simple. It adds the
House Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee and the Senate Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Committee
to the list of committees that will re-
ceive a briefing from the Director of
National Intelligence on emerging in-
fectious disease and pandemics.
The Energy and Commerce Sub-
committee on Health has jurisdiction
over all public health and quarantine,
as well as the Centers for Disease Con-
trol.
Given the Energy and Commerce
Committee’s and the Senate Health,
Education, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee’s jurisdiction over the Assistant
Secretary of Preparedness and Re-
sponse, which plays an integral role in
our Nation’s public health and secu-
rity, it is imperative that these com-
mittees be included in this briefing.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.

Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chair, I rise in op-
position to the amendment, although I
am not opposed.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. THOMPSON of
Mississippi). Without objection, the
gentleman from California is recog-
nized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chair, the gen-
tleman from Texas’ proposal would
allow the congressional committees
with jurisdiction over public health
matters the opportunity to receive a
briefing about the effects of emerging
and infectious diseases and pandemics
on national security and the inter-
national political and economic sys-
tem, along with the Intelligence Com-
mittee and Armed Services Committee.
It is critical that Congress be well-in-
formed on the posture of the United
States and, indeed, the rest of the
world to address a public health crisis
that might arise in the face of a par-
ticularly rapidly spreading, dev-
astating disease. It is crucial that com-
mittees that oversee public health re-
sponses understand how prepared we
may be to address such a crisis.
I support this amendment, and I be-
lieve it will be helpful to our col-
leagues on the House Energy and Com-
merce Committee and the Senate
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee to receive this brief-
ing and information from the DNI,
along with the Intelligence, Armed
Services, Foreign Affairs, and Appro-
priations Committees that are already
included in the bill text.

Mr. STEWART. Mr. Chair, again I
rise as the designee of Mr. BURGESS,
and I have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of title VII, add the following
new section:
SEC. 7lll. REMOVAL AND NEUTRALIZATION OF
IMSI CATCHERS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Home-
land Security, in collaboration with the Di-
rector of National Intelligence, the Chair-
man of the Federal Communications Com-
mission, and the heads of such other Federal
agencies as the Secretary determines appro-
priate, and following consultation with ap-
propriate private entities, shall—
(1) undertake an effort to remove or neu-
tralize unauthorized IMSI catchers installed
by foreign entities or that have an unknown
attribution, with prioritization given to
IMSI catchers identified in the National Cap-
ital Region; and
(2) conduct further assessments, not less
than once every 90 days, to identify new
IMSI catchers for removal or neutralization.
(b) IMSI CATCHER DEFINED.—The term
‘‘IMSI catcher’’ means an international mo-
bile subscriber identity-catcher or other de-
vice used for intercepting mobile phone iden-
tifying information and location data.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 491, the gentleman
from Utah (Mr. STEWART) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Utah.
Mr. STEWART. Mr. Chair, once
again, my amendment is simple. It di-
rects the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity, in collaboration with the Director
of National Intelligence, Chairman of
the Federal Communications Commis-
sion, and appropriate private entities,
to undertake an effort to remove or
neutralize unauthorized international
mobile subscriber identity catchers, or
cell-site simulators, installed by for-
eign entities or that have an unknown
attribution.
International mobile subscriber iden-
tities, IMSI, catchers, or cell-site sim-
ulators, are devices used for inter-
cepting mobile traffic and location
data. They appear to be legitimate cell
phone towers that nearby phones may
connect to. Once connected, phone lo-
cations can be tracked.
Some advanced IMSI catchers can
even read content, such as messages
and cell phone data. Much remains un-
known about the proliferation of these
devices, particularly in the national
capital region. However, we do know
that foreign actors have access to and
have used these devices.
It is imperative that our intelligence
community, with the relevant agencies
and private industry partners, under-
take an effort to neutralize unauthor-
ized IMSI catchers.
Mr. Chair, I urge support of this
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Utah (Mr. STEWART).
The amendment was agreed to.

SEC. 7ll. PLAN FOR STRENGTHENING THE SUP-
PLY CHAIN INTELLIGENCE FUNC-
TION.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days
after the date of the enactment of this Act,
the Director of the National Counterintel-
ligence and Security Center, in coordination
with the Director of the Defense Counter-
intelligence and Security Agency and other
interagency partners, shall submit to Con-
gress a plan for strengthening the supply
chain intelligence function.
(b) ELEMENTS.—The plan submitted under
subsection (a) shall address the following:
(1) The appropriate workforce model, in-
cluding size, mix, and seniority, from the
elements of the intelligence community and
other interagency partners.
(2) The budgetary resources necessary to
implement the plan.
(3) The appropriate governance structure
within the intelligence community and with
interagency partners.
(4) The authorities necessary to implement
the plan.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 491, the gentleman
from Indiana (Mr. CARSON) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Indiana.
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Chair,
first, I thank Chairman SCHIFF and
Ranking Member NUNES for their work
on the Intelligence Authorization Act
this year. It is always a pleasure to
serve under Chairman SCHIFF’s leader-
ship. Without it, the Intelligence Com-
mittee would not have been able to
pass such a strong bill out of com-
mittee.
I rise today, Mr. Chair, in support of
an amendment that I have offered to
the underlying bill text. This amend-
ment will help the United States pro-
tect the integrity of its economic sup-
ply chain infrastructure. I am pleased
that my good friend Representative
ELISE STEFANIK has joined me in co-
sponsoring this amendment.
Today, businesses and organizations
in the United States face an array of
distinct and stealthy threats. The
American supply chain is under re-
peated attack from foreign intelligence
services, cyber hackers, and sophisti-
cated criminal enterprises.
Unfortunately, experienced adver-
saries often exploit vulnerabilities in
American companies’ technological in-
frastructure or weak links in their or-
ganizational supply chain so that they
can steal their intellectual property,
co-opt equipment from suppliers, dam-
age software, or conduct surveillance.
Moving forward, we must be more vigi-
lant to stop them.
The Carson-Stefanik amendment, Mr.
Chair, will guard against these grave
concerns, and it will lead to stronger
safeguards for the supply chain by
mandating the National Counterintel-
ligence and Security Center to produce
a plan within 6 months to strengthen
the supply chain intelligence function
within the intelligence community.
The plan, Mr. Chair, will identify per-
sonnel with the right expertise from
the intelligence community workforce,
outline budgetary and resource needs,
and describe the necessary authorities
and governance structure for future
implementation of this plan.
It will inform both the executive
branch and Congress’ efforts to en-
hance our defenses against exploitation
of the supply chain.
The United States remains one of the
most technologically advanced econo-
mies in the world. Throughout the past
century, America has enjoyed unprece-
dented economic growth because of the
ingenuity of our people and the techno-
logical innovation that undergirds that
entrepreneurial spirit.
While that economic growth has not
always been evenly distributed, and we
are still wrestling with debates about
economic inequality, surrendering our
technological edge and innovative ad-
vantages to strategic rivals would pose
a huge risk to America’s future pros-
perity and security.
I believe, Mr. Chair, it is very impor-
tant to offer this amendment, recog-
nizing the evolving and emerging
threats to our Nation’s supply chain
infrastructure. In a very rapidly devel-
oping global economy, the intelligence
community must work to safeguard
the core of what America and her com-
petitive strength is: economic, intellec-
tual, and technological ingenuity.
My amendment proactively works to-
ward that goal, ensuring that we stay
on top of those varying threats to our
supply chain infrastructure that ema-
nate from strategic rivals.
In addition to this amendment, Mr.
Chair, I would like to highlight an-
other important part of the base bill.
This year’s Intelligence Authorization
Act includes an entire section on do-
mestic terrorism. It is important that
we acknowledge domestic terrorism as
a very serious threat, and we must do
more than just talk about it as a soci-
etal problem. We must act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5889
July 16, 2019
Domestic terrorism incidents in the
U.S. are on the rise, fueled by hatred,
stoked by fear, and inspired by dan-
gerous rhetoric. At a time when this
President is ignoring the truth about
domestic terrorism, and his adminis-
tration is concealing and hiding the
proliferation of white supremacist-in-
spired incidents, Congress and the pub-
lic urgently need more information to
better understand and prevent domes-
tic terrorism.
Specifically, Mr. Chair, this bill
would require the FBI, Department of
Homeland Security, and NCTC to
produce an annual report on domestic
terrorism. With the reporting that is
mandated in the underlying intel-
ligence authorization bill, we can bet-
ter determine how to change the law
and make the necessary adjustments to
procedures and to adequately shift cur-
rent practices in order to fully address
the threat of domestic terrorism and
its root causes.
Much of the report, Mr. Chair, would
be made available to the public, in-
creasing transparency, while the full
report would be provided to oversight
committees in greater detail. It would
be valuable information and would re-
quire an annual strategic assessment
on trends and patterns. Ultimately, it
will dramatically expand the informa-
tion on domestic terrorism available to
Congress and the public.
I urge my colleagues to support the
Carson-Stefanik amendment and the
underlying bill, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. CARSON).
The amendment was agreed to.

former CIA officer, the gentlewoman
from the Commonwealth of Virginia, to
offer this bipartisan amendment that
would direct the intelligence commu-
nity to prioritize resources to address
the humanitarian crisis at the border,
in the Northern Triangle, and also in
Mexico.
I represent more of the southern bor-
der than any other Member of Con-
gress. The root causes of this current
crisis are violence, extreme poverty,
and lack of economic opportunity in
the Northern Triangle—El Salvador,
Guatemala, and Honduras.
Drug cartels, human traffickers, and
human smugglers are making this cri-
sis worse and putting innocent lives at
risk. They profit while people in Cen-
tral America suffer and entire nations
are destabilized.
Our intelligence community is not
maximizing the use of our intelligence
to deny and disrupt these operations.
In June, we all know that 104,000 peo-
ple were detained at our border. Al-
most every one of them had a phone
number of a smuggler, a license plate
of a bus that brought them here, or a
pickup location in their home country.
Understanding and disabling these
smuggling and trafficking networks
should be a national intelligence pri-
ority. This amendment would require
the Director of National Intelligence to
conduct a review of intelligence collec-
tion priorities in the Northern Triangle
and Mexico and then provide quarterly
briefings to Congress regarding the in-
telligence community activities in this
region.
These individuals and organizations
threaten the security of the United
States and the Western Hemisphere,
and we should be using intelligence to
stop them.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Chair, I rise
in opposition to the amendment, al-
though I am not opposed.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentlewoman from Virginia is
recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Chair, I am
proud to introduce this amendment
alongside my colleague, Congressman
HURD from Texas, who is also a former
CIA case officer.
Our bipartisan amendment, the Traf-
ficking and Smuggling Intelligence
Act, comes at a time of great hardship,
violence, and heartbreak across Mexico
and the Northern Triangle countries
and at a time of crisis at our southern
border.
The volatility in our backyard should
be cause for serious concern. Here in
the United States, we have experienced
the devastating effects of the drug
trade on the health of our citizens. On
our southwest border, we have wit-
nessed how ongoing violence and insta-
bility in Central America is a driving
factor for increased migration toward
the United States.
Our bipartisan amendment would re-
quire intelligence assessments of drug
trafficking organizations, human traf-
ficking organizations, and human
smugglers across Mexico and the
Northern Triangle.
b 1945
These would include reports that
could be released publicly to the Amer-
ican people.
Our amendment would direct our
public servants to use their expertise
to better understand the root causes of
violence, instability, and migration.
With these improved assessments from
DNI, we would be able to strengthen
our national security in the face of
threats from traffickers, smugglers,
and other criminal organizations.
Like so many of our colleagues, Con-
gressman HURD and I recognize that if
we are to keep Americans safe while
also responsibly addressing the situa-
tion at the border, we must address the
conditions at the core of the instability
we are seeing in Central America.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
on both sides of the aisle to join us in
supporting this amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I
am looking forward to working on
more pieces of legislation with my
friend from the Commonwealth of Vir-
ginia, and I want to thank both of the
gentlemen from California and their
teams for helping us perfect this to get
this important piece of legislation onto
the floor.
Again, Mr. Chairman, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. HURD).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 5 OFFERED BY MR. THOMPSON
OF MISSISSIPPI
The Acting CHAIR (Ms.
SPANBERGER). It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 5 printed in part
B of House Report 116–154.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Madam Chair, I have an amendment at
the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 62, after line 4 insert the following:
(6) Applicable Federal requirements and
compliance by the Federal Government with
privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties poli-
cies and protections with respect to the pro-
duction of the report, including protections
against the public release of names or other
personally identifiable information of indi-
viduals involved in incidents, investigations,
indictments, prosecutions, or convictions for
which data is reported under this section.

(and redesignate the succeeding clauses):
(ii) the date and location of such incident;
Page 65, line 18, strike ‘‘and’’ at the end.
Page 66, line 9, strike the period at the end
and insert ‘‘; and’’.
Page 66, after line 9 insert the following:
(ix) with respect to the Office of Intel-
ligence and Analysis of the Department of
Homeland Security, the number of staff (ex-
pressed in terms of full-time equivalents and
positions) working on matters relating to do-
mestic terrorism described in clauses (i)
through (vi).
Page 69, after line 7 insert the following:
(h) INFORMATION QUALITY.—Each report
submitted under subsection (a), to the extent
applicable, shall comply with the guidelines
issued by the Director of the Office of Man-
agement and Budget pursuant to section 515
of title V of the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2001 (Public Law 106–554; 114 Stat. 2763A–
154).
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 491, the gentleman

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Madam Chair, I yield myself such time
as I may consume.
Madam Chair, I rise to offer an
amendment to title VI of H.R. 3494 ti-
tled Federal Efforts Against Domestic
Terrorism. I am pleased to see that
this title was significantly informed by
my bill, H.R. 3106, the Domestic Ter-
rorism DATA Act which the Homeland
Security Committee will be consid-
ering tomorrow.
I am glad to have the opportunity to
work with Chairman SCHIFF and the
Permanent Select Committee on Intel-
ligence on this text.
My legislation, which requires the
government to produce an annual do-
mestic terrorism report, was the prod-
uct of more than 5 months of engage-
ment with outside stakeholders and ex-
perts. As a result of that consultation
process, I included protections for civil
rights, civil liberties, privacy, and data
quality in my bill. These provisions
made my bill stronger. My amendment
to H.R. 3494 would require that these
very protections are included.
Madam Chair, my amendment also
requires additional information be in-
cluded in the government’s domestic
terrorism report. Requiring the date
and location of each incident of ter-
rorism or investigation of terrorism
will help Congress and the public bet-
ter understand the landscape of domes-
tic terrorism.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support my amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, I was
going to request the chairman yield me
1 minute of time.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from California (Mr.
SCHIFF).
The Acting CHAIR (Mrs. DINGELL).
Does the gentleman seek unanimous
consent to reclaim his time?
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Yes.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Mississippi is
recognized for the balance of his time.
There was no objection.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Madam Chair, I yield such time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
California (Mr. SCHIFF).

July 16, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, this
amendment clarifies section 602 of the
bill dealing with domestic terrorism.
This section would require the FBI,
DHS, and the National Counterterror-
ism Center to produce an annual report
and joint strategic intelligence assess-
ment on domestic terrorism.
Chairman THOMPSON’s amendment
would add safeguards to protect the
civil liberties and privacy of individ-
uals whose information would be con-
tained in the report and mandate com-
pliance with the Data Quality Act.
It also would require DHS to disclose
information on the allocation of per-
sonnel working domestic terrorism
matters, enhancing oversight in this
area.
I would like to recognize Chairman
THOMPSON for his work that the House
Homeland Security Committee has
done on the issue of domestic ter-
rorism. Together we will continue our
lines of effort to address this signifi-
cant threat.
Once again, Madam Chair, I thank
my colleague for his work, and I urge
support for the amendment.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Madam Chair, I yield back the balance

Nation’s energy infrastructure, espe-

tems. The 2015 Ukraine grid intrusion
orchestrated by the Russians was a
turning point in industrial cybersecu-
rity. For the first time, hackers pene-
trated industrial controls of a power
plant with the goal of causing wide-
spread disruption.
Both the security and economic con-

our energy grid cannot be overstated.
We can no longer wait to address these

eye on emerging threats that could dis-
rupt electricity generation or even cost
lives.
I want to thank our government
partners, including the Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency,
CISA, the intelligence community, the
Department of Energy, and national
labs. I look forward to working with all
these stakeholders to ensure that we
are implementing grid security meas-
ures in a responsible way consistent
with existing law and authorities. As a
member of the Homeland Security Sub-
committee on Appropriations, I fully
intend to help leverage the authoriza-
tion in this amendment to supplement
the already great effort underway at
CISA and other government agencies.
Also I want to thank the many tal-
ented computer scientists, cybersecu-
rity experts, and engineers from the
private sector, especially the team at
Dragos, a cybersecurity firm focused
on industrial controls, located in my
district in Hanover, Maryland, for all
the hard work they do in this space to
not only defend against threats but to
educate others.
Our amendment is simple and mir-
rors language already passed by the
overwhelming bipartisan majority in
the Senate’s Intelligence Authorization
Act. Senator KING from Maine has been
a stalwart force on this issue, and none
of this would have happened without
his determination and vision on this
issue.
The amendment sets up a 2-year pilot
program to identify the classes of secu-
rity vulnerabilities in the grid. It es-
tablishes a working group to evaluate
the technology solutions proposed by
the pilot program. The working group
would include government agencies,
the energy industry, and other experts.
Lastly, it requires the Department of
Energy to submit a report to the rel-
evant congressional committees de-
scribing the results of the program.
Finally, I want to thank Judge Car-
ter from Texas who has led the charge
on this issue with me in the House
since last Congress. Judge Carter is a
good friend, and I appreciate his help
on this important issue.
Madam Chair, this amendment will
help the intelligence community and
the government at large better under-
stand the vulnerabilities to certain as-
pects of our energy grid.
Madam Chair, I yield such time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
California (Mr. SCHIFF), who is the dis-
tinguished chairman of the Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chairman, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
I rise in strong support of the amend-
ment offered by my colleagues from
Maryland and Texas which mirrors lan-
guage passed in the Senate’s intel-
ligence authorization bill last month.
This provision would bring together
government entities and the energy
sector in a pilot program for purposes
of evaluating and strengthening indus-
trial control systems and related crit-
ical infrastructure elements against se-
curity vulnerabilities and exploits.
The cyber threats faced by our crit-
ical infrastructure remain a persistent
national security concern, as the
former ranking member of our com-
mittee, the distinguished Mr. RUPPERS-
BERGER, knows all too well. DNI Coats
likewise warned in the most recent un-
classified Worldwide Threat Assess-
ment about the capabilities of our ad-
versaries to hold U.S. critical infra-
structure at risk.
This measure is another line of effort
toward securing that infrastructure
against outside cyberattacks and dis-
ruptions, and I am very proud to sup-
port the work of my colleague and
friend.
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Madam
Chair, I yield such time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.
CARTER).
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Chair,
I thank my friend for yielding.
Madam Chair, today I rise in strong
support of the Ruppersberger-Carter
amendment to help secure the energy
infrastructure. Now is the time to ad-
dress electrical grid security. Grid at-
tacks are a powerful weapon in the
cyber toolkit of really bad actors.
As the two previous speakers said, a
cyberattack in Ukraine wiped out their
power grid, and over 225,000 people were
without power. The Office of the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence in their
2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment
makes numerous mentions of our ad-
versaries’ mapping out grid systems,
identifying our weaknesses, and devel-
oping the very real and deadly capacity
to attack our grid system. A targeted
attack on our Nation could be dev-
astating.
Securing our energy infrastructure is
especially critical in Texas which
maintains an independent electric grid.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman from Maryland has expired.
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Chair,
I claim the time in opposition to the
amendment, although I do not oppose
the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Texas is rec-
ognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Chair,
the Electric Reliability Council of
Texas is located in Taylor, Texas,
which is about 19 miles from my house,
and it manages 90 percent of my home
State’s electrical load. Understanding
where our system’s weak spots are will
enhance ERCOT’s work to ensure that
we have the most stable and secure en-
ergy network in the world.
Our amendment addresses the serious
topic of electrical grid security by
leveraging the unique aspects of na-
tional laboratories to establish solu-
tions to defend the United States en-
ergy grid from attacks and to ensure
the resiliency of operation during and
after an event.
It establishes a 2-year pilot program
to study and identify new classes of se-
curity vulnerabilities, and research and
test technologies that could be used to
isolate the most critical systems from
cyberattacks.
It creates working groups to develop
a national cyber-informed strategy to
protect our energy grids.
This amendment is a commonsense
approach to solving grid security. I am
proud to work across the aisle with my
good friend and colleague, DUTCH RUP-
PERSBERGER, on this important issue.
Madam Chair, I urge support of this
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. RUPPERS-
BERGER).
The amendment was agreed to.

AMENDMENT NO. 7 OFFERED BY MR. CHABOT
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 7 printed in
part B of House Report 116–154.
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 35, strike line 4 through page 42, line

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 491, the gentleman
from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Ohio.
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Chair, I rise
this evening to offer a commonsense
amendment to H.R. 3494.
My amendment simply strikes Sec-
tion 401, which creates the Climate Se-
curity Advisory Council. And I thank
the gentleman from South Carolina
(Mr. DUNCAN) for his leadership, and
also cosponsoring this particular
amendment.
This council is not the most respon-
sible use of the valuable manpower and
funding of the intelligence community,
especially since the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence did not even request
that we create such an organization.
The Federal Government already has
vast resources devoted to the climate
issue.
Any climate security intelligence
work should be in the context of larger
intelligence matters affecting major
regions around the world and the U.S.
national security infrastructure.

July 16, 2019
Additionally, many of the existing
intelligence organizations already do
much of this work on their own, in-
cluding the CIA. Section 401 would just
create unneeded redundancy across the
intelligence community.
If the goal is to ensure that we allo-
cate our resources efficiently, we
should instead require a report to Con-
gress from the Office of the Director of
National Intelligence outlining the ne-
cessity for the Climate Security Coun-
cil before Congress establishes the or-
ganization or appropriates any funding.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. For what purpose
does the gentleman—
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Chair, I rise in
favor of the Chabot amendment.
Our country faces serious threats
around the globe. We have cyber
threats coming from China, Russia,
and Iran, and others. Iran is also pur-
suing nuclear weapons that threaten
our friends and our ally, Israel, and in-
deed the rest of the world.
While ISIS is defeated and on the
run, radical islamic terrorism remains
one of our Nation’s greatest threats,
thanks in part to Iran’s actions as a
leading state sponsor of terrorism.
It is, therefore, extremely irrespon-
sible to take our attention and re-
sources off of these known and proven
threats to American national security
and divert those funds and attention to
climate change.
The intelligence community, which
is tasked with protecting Americans
from fiscal and cyberattacks, should
not bear the burden of silly, politically
correct, left-wing social policy. But
just as Democrats politicized military
policy with the NDAA, here they go
again with the intelligence policy.
That is a mistake, it is irresponsible,
and that is why I support this amend-
ment to strip out this silly idea and
refocus the intelligence community on
the actual threats to our national secu-
rity.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Ohio has the only time remain-
ing.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment and
claim time in opposition, therefore.
The Acting CHAIR. The time in oppo-
sition has already been claimed.
Would the gentleman from Ohio yield
to your colleague from—
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Chair, may I
inquire as to how much time I have re-
maining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Ohio has 21⁄2 minutes remaining.
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, I want to quote a great
American President, Ronald Reagan.
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, may I
make a parliamentary inquiry?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from California will state his par-
liamentary inquiry.
Mr. SCHIFF. Did the Chair offer time
in opposition to the amendment?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from South Carolina claimed the time.
The Chair looked to see who was
seeking recognition, and went to the
gentleman who was standing.
Mr. HECK. Madam Chair, I was
standing when he was recognized. The
gentleman from Ohio did not yield to
him. And when he asked to claim time
in opposition, he did not say ‘‘although
I am not opposed.’’ And you did not,
therefore, ask if there was no objec-
tion.
He was not legitimately recognized.
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Chair, I ask
unanimous consent that the gentleman
be granted 5 minutes in opposition, but
I have a little time left.
Madam Chair, I have no objection to
the gentleman offering his opposition
to this.
The Acting CHAIR. That unanimous
consent request cannot be entertained
in the Committee of the Whole.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, I am
sorry. I couldn’t hear the ruling of the
Chair.
The gentleman asked for unanimous
consent.
The Acting CHAIR. The Parliamen-
tarian advised that the request cannot
be entertained in the Committee of the
Whole.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, well, if
my colleagues in the minority—I don’t
know how much time they have both
on the amendment and on the time in
opposition to the amendment—but if
they can yield to my colleague to make
sure that he has time for his remarks
out of both of their time, I think we
can resolve this.
Mr. CHABOT. There is 21⁄2 minutes
left. Is that correct?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Ohio has 21⁄2 minutes remaining.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, the gen-
tleman offering the amendment has
how much time? Because they claimed
both the time on the amendment—
The Acting CHAIR. The proponent of
the amendment has 21⁄2 minutes re-
maining.
Mr. SCHIFF. So no one claimed the
time in opposition?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from South Carolina claimed the time
and yielded back.
Mr. SCHIFF. Okay. So there should
be 5 minutes.
Mr. HECK. He asked for time in oppo-
sition but did not state that he was not
opposed.
You did not ask if, therefore, there
was no objection. He was not legiti-
mately recognized.
The offerer of the amendment did not
yield to him. The gentleman from
South Carolina claimed time in opposi-
tion but did not say ‘‘although I am
not opposed.’’ He supported the amend-
ment. And you did not ask if there was
no objection.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
will suspend.
The gentleman claimed the time, and
then he yielded back his time.
Mr. HECK. Madam Chair, you didn’t
ask if there was no objection, which is
the customary practice.
The Acting CHAIR. All time claimed
by the gentleman from South Carolina
has been yielded back.
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Chair, I still
have 21⁄2 minutes, is that correct, be-
cause I reserved my time?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Ohio has the only time remain-
ing.
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Chair, I would
like to make a unanimous consent re-
quest that there be an opposition that
gets 5 minutes and that I can close
with my 21⁄2 minutes.
We are trying to be fair here, and we
are happy to give our colleagues on the
other side of the aisle 5 minutes to
offer their opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The Parliamen-
tarian advises that the request cannot
be entertained in the Committee of the
Whole.
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Chair, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from
Washington (Mr. HECK). I will just take
1 minute to wrap up.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized.
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Chair, I have
21⁄2 minutes. Is that right?
The Acting CHAIR. Yes. The gen-
tleman is recognized.
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Chair, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from
Washington (Mr. HECK).
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
yields 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman
from Washington?
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Chair, 2 min-
utes in opposition.
Mr. SCHIFF. If I could, Madam
Chair, through the Chair to my col-
league, I appreciate that. We will take
you up on that. And on the next
amendment that we have time, I will
yield to my colleague, and your col-
league may yield to you, if you have
further comments you want to make
on this issue.
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Chair, I have
21⁄2 minutes. I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the
gentleman from Washington (Mr.
HECK). So I have 1 minute left.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentleman through the Chair.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Washington is recognized for 11⁄2
minutes.
Mr. HECK. Madam Chair, I thank
very much the graciousness of the gen-
tleman from Ohio, although I think his
amendment is wrongheaded.
Here is what is real:
Climate change is real, number one.
Number two, it has significant na-
tional security implications.
Number three, the only smart thing
to do is to borrow the old motto from
the Boy Scouts, ‘‘Be prepared.’’ Pas-
sage of this amendment, which would
remove the Climate Security Advisory
Council, renders us less prepared.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5894 July 16, 2019
We all know that the intelligence
community and the DOD have, time
and again, assessed the measurable ef-
fects of climate change—rising sea lev-
els, higher temperatures, more fre-
quent extreme weather events, new
stressors on natural resources and agri-
culture—have tangible impacts that
exacerbate economic distress, human
insecurity, political instability, and
other humanitarian conditions detri-
mental to our national security.
The smart thing to do is to be pre-
pared, to have the advisory council
that can work across the intelligence
community, that can collect the infor-
mation, coordinate the information, so
that we know what is coming, we know
what we are being presented with, and
we can confront it in a smart way.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to please defeat this amendment and
pass the underlying bill.
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Chair, I think I
have 1 minute left.
I thought perhaps the gentleman
wanted to support my amendment, but
he called it wrongheaded. I am just
shocked.
Madam Chair, in closing, this council
is a redundant, unnecessary use of
manpower funding. We need our intel-
ligence community focused on the
most critical threats facing our Na-
tion, specifically, counterterrorism,
Iran, China, Russia, North Korea.
If this council is something that the
Director of National Intelligence be-
lieves is critical to our country, he
should come to Congress and make
such a request, and to my knowledge,
that has not occurred. Madam Chair,
until he does, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment and remove
this provision from the bill.
I yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. All time for de-
bate has expired.
The question is on the amendment
offered by the gentleman from Ohio

annual report that aggregates demo-
graphic data and other information re-
garding the diversity and inclusion ef-
forts within the intelligence commu-
nity.

At the end of title VII, add the following
new section:
SEC. 708. REPORT ON BEST PRACTICES TO PRO-
TECT PRIVACY AND CIVIL LIB-
ERTIES OF CHINESE AMERICANS.
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) the People’s Republic of China appears
to be specifically targeting the Chinese-
American community for intelligence pur-
poses;
(2) such targeting carries a substantial risk
that the loyalty of such Americans may be
generally questioned and lead to unaccept-
able stereotyping, targeting and racial
profiling;
(3) the United States Government has a
duty to warn and protect all Americans in-
cluding those of Chinese descent from these
intelligence efforts by the People’s Republic
of China;
(4) the broad stereotyping, targeting and
racial profiling of Americans of Chinese de-
scent is contrary to the values of the United
States and reinforces the flawed narrative
perpetuated by the People’s Republic of
China that ethnically Chinese individuals
worldwide have a duty to support the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China; and
(5) the United States efforts to combat the
People’s Republic of China’s intelligence ac-
tivities should actively safeguard and pro-
mote the constitutional rights of all Chinese
Americans.
(b) REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after
the date of the enactment of this Act, the
Director of National Intelligence, acting
through the Office of Civil Liberties, Pri-
vacy, and Transparency, in coordination
with the civil liberties and privacy officers
of the elements of the intelligence commu-
nity, shall submit a report to the congres-
sional intelligence committees containing—
(1) a review of how the policies, procedures,
and practices of the intelligence community
that govern the intelligence activities and
operations targeting the People’s Republic of
China affect policies, procedures, and prac-
tices relating to the privacy and civil lib-
erties of Americans of Chinese descent who
may be targets of espionage and influence
operations by China; and
(2) recommendations to ensure that the
privacy and civil liberties of Americans of
Chinese descent are sufficiently protected.
(c) FORM.—The report under subsection (b)
shall be submitted in unclassified form, but
may include a classified annex.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 491, the gentleman
from Hawaii (Mr. CASE) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Hawaii.
Mr. CASE. Madam Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, not far from here, on
the slopes of Capitol Hill, is a small,
serene, and unassuming memorial. On
its walls are names not now known to
too many Americans but indelibly
etched in a dark chapter of our na-
tional story.
Tule Lake, Poston, Manzanar—these
are the internment camps where 120,000
ethnic Japanese, most of them Amer-
ican citizens, were locked up in the
hysteria of the Second World War just
because they were Japanese.
This amendment, proudly sponsored
by many of my colleagues in our Con-
gressional Asian Pacific American Cau-
cus, including our chair, the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. JUDY CHU),
asked us a question that must be
asked: Are we repeating history or in
danger of doing so?
b 2015
In these recent years of justifiably
heightened scrutiny on the intelligence
activities of the People’s Republic of
China, a disproportionate number of
Americans of Chinese descent have
been investigated and prosecuted for
espionage.
Those convicted have received dis-
proportionately high sentences, and
the too many exonerated have had
their careers ruined nonetheless.
No doubt, China seeks to recruit Chi-
nese Americans to its goals, and no
doubt, our government should and
must review specific cases of potential
espionage by China on specific facts.
But have we fallen into the same trap
all over again of justifying investiga-
tions and other actions toward the
ends of national security by means of
general profiling and targeting based
solely on ethnic identity?
The Committee of 100, a group of
prominent Chinese Americans in di-
verse fields, reviewed the empirical evi-
dence and concluded that ‘‘Asian
Americans, whether immigrant or na-
tive-born, may be facing unfair and in-
creasing racial prejudice in this era of
geopolitical competition.’’
It stated, and I believe correctly: ‘‘A
definite line can be drawn between ap-
propriate prosecution that is based on
actual evidence and free of bias and
overreaching persecution that is trig-
gered by unfounded suspicions and
tainted by racial prejudice. All Ameri-
cans, regardless of ethnicity, depend on
that line.’’
This resolution is a flashing red light
to our intelligence community: Stop,
look, and listen. Take some time to
think it through to be sure you are
staying on the right side of that line,
and then report back to us here in Con-
gress that you have done so and have
the procedures and mindset in place to
ensure that we won’t repeat history
with Chinese Americans or any other
broad ethnic or interest group.
Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from California (Mr.
SCHIFF), the committee chair.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
I strongly support the amendment.
This amendment expresses the sense of
Congress that racial profiling of Amer-
icans of Chinese descent is contrary to
the values of the United States and re-
inforces flawed narratives perpetuated
by the People’s Republic of China that
ethnically Chinese individuals world-
wide have a duty to support the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China.
Moreover, the amendment reaffirms
that the United States Government has
a duty to warn and protect all Ameri-
cans, including those of Chinese de-
scent, from intelligence operations exe-
cuted by the People’s Republic of
China.
Finally, the amendment requires the
ODNI Office of Civil Liberties, Privacy,
and Transparency, in coordination
with civil liberties and privacy officers
throughout the intelligence commu-
nity, to submit a report to the congres-
sional intelligence committees. This
report would review how the intel-
ligence community policies that gov-
ern counterintelligence operations
against China impact the civil liberties
of Americans of Chinese descent who
are the targets of Chinese espionage
and provide recommendations to pre-
serve these liberties and privacy inter-
ests.
Mr. CASE’s important amendment re-
affirms that Americans of all back-
grounds deserve equal protection under
the law and reminds our intelligence
community of its duty to protect the
privacy and civil liberties of all per-
sons.
Madam Chair, again, I thank my col-
league for his work, and I strongly sup-
port the amendment.
Mr. CASE. Madam Chair, I strongly
urge adoption of this amendment. It is
the right amendment. We certainly
want our intelligence community to do
its job, but we also want them to be
very conscious of the decisions that
they are making and are in line with
our basic civil liberties.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE).
The amendment was agreed to.

SEC. 708. INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT OF RELA-
TIONSHIP BETWEEN WOMEN AND
VIOLENT EXTREMISM.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days
after the date of the enactment of this Act,
and annually thereafter, the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence, in consultation with the
Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State,
and the head of any element of the intel-
ligence community the Director determines
appropriate, shall submit to the appropriate
congressional committees an intelligence as-
sessment on the relationship between women
and violent extremism and terrorism
throughout the world, including an assess-
ment of—
(1) the historical trends and current state
of women’s varied roles worldwide in all as-
pects of violent extremism and terrorism, in-
cluding as recruiters, sympathizers, per-
petrators, and combatants, as well as peace-
builders and preventers;
(2) how women’s roles in all aspects of vio-
lent extremism and terrorism are likely to
change in the near- and medium-term;
(3) the extent to which the unequal status
of women affects the ability of armed com-
batants and terrorist groups to enlist or con-
script women as combatants and perpetra-
tors of violence;
(4) how terrorist groups violate the rights
of women and girls, including child, early,
and forced marriage, abduction, sexual vio-
lence, and human trafficking, and the extent
to which such violations contribute to the
spread of conflict and terrorist activities;
and
(5) opportunities to address the security
risk posed by female extremists and leverage
the roles of women in counterterrorism ef-
forts.
(b) FORM.—The assessment required under
subsection (a) shall be submitted in unclassi-
fied form, but may include a classified
annex.
(c) APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMIT-
TEES DEFINED.—In this section, the term
‘‘appropriate congressional committees’’
means—
(1) the Select Committee on Intelligence,
the Committee on Foreign Relations, and
the Committee on Armed Services, of the
Senate; and
(2) the Permanent Select Committee on In-
telligence, the Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs, and the Committee on Armed Services,
of the House of Representatives.

Member opposed each will control 5

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida.
Ms. FRANKEL. Madam Chair, this
amendment takes an important step
toward fighting terrorism. It would re-
quire the Director of National Intel-
ligence to submit an intelligence as-
sessment on the relationship between
women and violent extremism and ter-
rorism.
Madam Chair, to prevent ISIS 2.0 and
to improve U.S. counterterrorism and
peace-building efforts, we need to pay
more attention to the roles that
women play in violent extremism, in-
cluding as victims, as perpetrators, and
as preventers.
First, as victims, women are often
the first targets of terrorism. We have
seen it with the abduction and rape of
thousands of women and girls by ISIS,
the kidnapping of hundreds of girls by
Boko Haram in Nigeria, and the attack
of girls just trying to go to school by
the Taliban.
Secondly, Madam Chair, women are
not only the victims of terrorism.
Some are perpetrators. Recent research
shows that women are turning to ter-
ror organizations because of false
promises of protection, escape from
abuse at home, and even, believe it or
not, for leadership opportunities. As a
result, women-led attacks are rising. In
fact, now, 20 to 30 percent of foreign
terrorist fighters are women. In sub-
Saharan Africa alone, three out of four
child suicide bombers are girls.
Madam Chair, women are not only
victims and perpetrators of terrorism.
They are also preventers, as mothers,
wives, and daughters. They influence
their spouses and children. They are on
the front line of detecting early signs
of radicalization in their families and
communities.
Madam Chair, because of gender in-
equality, their warnings are often ig-
nored.
Let me give you an example. Afghan
women saw young men being recruited
at a wedding, and they shared their
concerns with law enforcement. They
were dismissed. Later, those same re-
cruits went on to kill 32 people in a bus
attack.
I conclude, Madam Chair, by saying
that understanding women’s unique
roles in terrorism is important to cre-
ating more peaceful communities
around the world, which results in
more security for the United States of
America.
Madam Chair, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this very important
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Florida (Ms. FRANKEL).

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 491, the gentleman
from Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY) and
a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Massachusetts.
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Chair, I begin
by thanking the chairman of the com-
mittee and his staff for their dedica-
tion to getting this amendment here
today and for their long and strong de-
fense of our electoral system from for-
eign interference.
Madam Chair, a few weeks ago, Spe-
cial Counsel Robert Mueller stood be-
fore the American people and issued a
stern warning and an ominous chal-
lenge. In what he referred to as the
central allegation of his 2-year-long in-
vestigation, he told us that there were
‘‘multiple, systemic efforts to interfere
in our election. That allegation de-
serves the attention of every Amer-
ican.’’
Our democracy was attacked, our
government undermined, and our elec-
tion system weakened. We were manip-
ulated.
A foreign adversary exposed many of
our worst impulses as they hacked,
prodded, forged, stole, lied, and ex-
ploited in a coordinated and sustained
effort to change the trajectory of this
country.
We cannot change what happened in
2016, but we can learn from it because
our adversaries certainly did. They
watched as politicians were all too
eager to use hacked material. They
took notes as social media networks
were used to inflame racial, geo-
graphic, and demographic divisions.
According to the ‘‘Worldwide Threat
Assessment’’ by the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence, Dan Coats, Russia,
China, and Iran already have their eyes
trained on 2020.
That is why we must proactively cre-
ate a foreign threat response center
tasked with identifying and rejecting
any attempts by any adversary to in-
fluence our political process because
we cannot hold ourselves up as a bea-
con of democracy if we are not willing
to defend the institutions upon which
our democratic system rests.
By removing politics from this re-
sponse and coordinating it under one
roof within the intelligence commu-
nity, we can rebuild that faith in our
system.
In this body, we have no greater re-
sponsibility than to protect the sanc-
tity of our elections, to protect the
trust of our citizens, and to protect our
faith in government. That is what this
amendment codifies.
Madam Chair, I encourage all of my
colleagues to support this amendment,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Chair, I
claim the time in opposition to the
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Chair, before
I get to my objections to the amend-
ment, I want to congratulate the chair-
man, the majority members of the
committee, as well as the majority
staff for the great work they did in
helping us bring a fully bipartisan bill
to the floor, which I fully intend to
support.
They also helped us navigate the in-
tricacies of the Rules Committee so
that what we are debating tonight,
with the amendments that were put
forward, we will be able to support this
bill on the floor tomorrow or whenever
they decide to bring it up. I thank the
chairman for the good work that they
put into it.
Madam Chair, I do, though, rise in
opposition to this amendment. For the
past several years, the House Intel-
ligence Committee has spent a signifi-
cant amount of time overseeing the in-
telligence community’s ongoing efforts
to counter foreign malign influence
targeting the United States. Although
Russia gains significant and necessary
attention given the events of 2016, the
committee is also concerned about Chi-
nese, Iranian, and other foreign powers
that have designs on sowing discord in
the United States or covertly influ-
encing the American populace.
The amendment today would estab-
lish a foreign threat response center
within the Office of the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence. While I believe my
colleague from Massachusetts offers
this amendment with the best of inten-
tions, it is clearly redundant to exist-
ing efforts and creates an additional
and potentially unnecessary bureauc-
racy within an organization that may
not be best suited to take the lead on
these actions.
This issue is not new. Last Congress,
we worked with the gentleman from
Massachusetts in adding a report to
the fiscal 2018 and 2019 IAAs that would
examine the necessity of a foreign ma-
lign influence response center. This re-
port remains in the bill, given that it is
a 3-year bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5898 July 16, 2019
I am not convinced of the necessity
of such a center, given the ongoing ef-
forts by our intelligence community to
address this problem. However, even
assuming its necessity, I am concerned
that the ODNI may not be the best
place for such a center. Based on our
ongoing oversight efforts, we know
that the interagency is taking the
threat of foreign malign influences
very seriously. Given the significant
counterintelligence impact to the
homeland, it may make more sense to
house such an entity within the FBI.
I don’t believe in putting the cart be-
fore the horse. It is important for us to
collect all the necessary information in
order for Congress to make an in-
formed decision after significant de-
bate on the merits of such a center and
whether the ODNI is the right home for
it. This debate should happen within
the Intelligence Committee. To date,
that debate has not occurred.
This amendment would also set up a
board to oversee the work of the For-
eign Intelligence Center, which would
then be overseen by the House and Sen-
ate Intelligence Committees. Again, a
redundancy that is, in my estimation,
not necessary.
Madam Chair, based on these fore-
going reasons, I will oppose the gentle-
man’s amendment and urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to
vote against it, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Chair, may I
inquire how much time I have remain-
ing?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Massachusetts has 21⁄2 minutes re-
maining.
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Chair, I yield
1 minute to the distinguished gen-
tleman from California (Mr. SCHIFF).
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
This amendment directs the intel-
ligence community to expand upon its
work in identifying and reporting for-
eign malign influence activity by es-
tablishing a center responsible for inte-
grating all intelligence pertaining to
foreign efforts to undermine our demo-
cratic institutions.
The committee and the intelligence
community has seen all too clearly
over the last 3 years that the malign
influence threats to U.S. sovereignty
and security are emerging as a new
normal, all the while becoming more
sophisticated and diverse.
Identifying and defending against
these threats, particularly those com-
mitted by strategic adversaries of the
U.S., requires a dedicated whole-of-in-
telligence-community effort in order to
fully understand the nature of the
threat and identify outstanding intel-
ligence gaps that need to be filled.
In establishing an interagency For-
eign Threat Response Center, this
amendment lays out a framework for
accomplishing this challenging task.
I thank my colleague for his work. I
appreciate Mr. KENNEDY’s commitment
to this area very much, and I support
the amendment.
Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Chair, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
In closing, I would like to reiterate
that the establishment of such a center
should be debated properly within the
House Intelligence Committee. It
should also be informed by the report
that the gentleman was successful in
adding to the fiscal 2018 and 2019 Intel-
ligence Authorization Acts, and such
debate should focus on the merits of
the center, given existing efforts, as
well as whether or not the ODNI should
house the center.
Until that report is finished, and
then the debate happens, I would urge
a ‘‘no’’ vote on the amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Chair, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
I would just say, in closing, that I ap-
preciate the gentleman’s words and the
work that they did with us to get the
report language into the version last
year. I would point out that much of
the intent behind this legislation and
this amendment is directly related to
what the gentleman indicated around
an ongoing threat assessment from
Russia, China, and Iran.
The issue isn’t so much, has that
threat been identified? It is, what has
the Intelligence Committee done to en-
sure the sanctity and the purity of
those elections?
I think this amendment speaks for
itself. I urge my colleagues to adopt it.
I yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KEN-
NEDY).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Chair, I de-
mand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Massachusetts will
be postponed.

I was pleased to see that my bill, the
Stop Terrorist Use of Virtual Cur-

ligence and Analysis into this report
and require that this report be dissemi-
nated to State and local law enforce-
ment officials.
In the 18 years since the deadliest
terrorist attack in American history,
the United States has led the global
campaign to combat terrorism, thwart-
ing plots and preventing attacks on
American soil, identifying and dis-
rupting terrorist networks around the
world, hunting down terrorists wher-
ever they hide, and proving that they
can and will be brought to justice.
But we also know that the threat of
terrorism is not the same as it was 18
years ago; it is a threat that con-
stantly evolves, and we need to evolve
with it. We need to evolve ahead of it.
That is why I have offered this amend-
ment.
In recent years, we have seen in-
stances in which members of terrorist
groups have turned to virtual cur-
rencies to finance and support their op-
erations.
For example, in December of 2017, a
woman in New York was arrested and
pled guilty after she obtained $62,000 in
bitcoin and other virtual currencies to
send to ISIS.
Using those virtual funds, she was
able to send the money via shell enti-
ties in Pakistan, China, and Turkey
that were fronts for ISIS.
In early 2017, Indonesian authorities
reported that a Syria-based Indonesian
with ties to ISIS used bitcoin and other
virtual currencies to fund attacks in
Indonesia.
The same things that make virtual
currencies appealing to everyday con-
sumers, speed and convenience, make
these currencies appealing to those
who want to finance illegal activities.
And many forms of virtual currencies
also offer their users anonymity, mak-
ing them particularly attractive to
those seeking to circumvent American
law enforcement and financial institu-
tions.

July 16, 2019
In order to effectively confront this
threat, we need to fully understand it.
We need a comprehensive assessment
of how virtual currencies might be
abused for illegal and nefarious ends.
That is why it is critical that we act
now to assess and understand this
emerging threat.
There is no denying it. Virtual cur-
rencies have exposed deep vulnerabili-
ties in our counterterrorism efforts.
And unfortunately, right now, our gov-
ernment lacks a comprehensive re-
sponse and strategy to address this
threat.
Passing this amendment will give
counterterrorism and law enforcement
officials at all levels the information
and strategies they desperately need to
confront this threat head-on with 21st-
century solutions.
This is a commonsense, bipartisan
priority, and I urge all my colleagues
to support this amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from California (Mr.
SCHIFF).
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding.
This straightforward amendment
adds the Under Secretary of Homeland
Security for Intelligence and Analysis
to the DNI’s consultation requirement
for its report on possible exploitation
of virtual currencies by terrorist ac-
tors.
It also requires the report’s dissemi-
nation to State and local law enforce-
ment, consistent with the protection of
classified information.
Ensuring that relevant counterter-
rorism information is distributed, as
appropriate, to State and local law en-
forcement is a key priority and a major
function of the Department of Home-
land Security. Adding these entities as
recipients of this report through the
DHS fusion center mechanism im-
proves the bill.
I want to encourage all my col-
leagues to support the amendment, as
well as the underlying bill. I thank my
colleague for her work.
Miss RICE of New York. Madam
Chair, I want to thank Chairman
SCHIFF and Ranking Member NUNES for
supporting the amendment.
I yield back the balance of my time.

AMENDMENT NO. 13 OFFERED BY MS. JAYAPAL
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 13 printed
in part B of House Report 116–154.
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of title VII, add the following
new section:
SEC. 3ll. REPORT ON USE BY INTELLIGENCE
COMMUNITY OF FACIAL RECOGNI-
TION TECHNOLOGY.
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) the use of facial recognition technology
for the purpose of suppressing or burdening
criticism or dissent, or for disadvantaging
persons based on their ethnicity, race, gen-
der, sexual orientation, or religion, is con-
trary to the values of the United States;
(2) the United States Government should
not engage in the sale or transfer of facial
recognition technology to any country that
is using such technology for the suppression
of human rights; and
(3) it is incumbent upon the intelligence
community to develop clear policies and pro-
cedures that prevent the abuse of facial rec-
ognition technology.
(b) REPORT REQUIRED.—Not later than 1
year after the date of the enactment of this
Act, the Director of National Intelligence
shall submit to the congressional intel-
ligence committees a report on the use of fa-
cial recognition technology by the intel-
ligence community. Such report shall in-
clude each of the following:
(1) An analysis of the current use of facial
recognition technology by the intelligence
community.
(2) An analysis of the accuracy of facial
recognition technology, including a discus-
sion of the appropriate threshold for use, and
data disaggregated by race, gender, eth-
nicity, and age.
(3) Whether the Government has adequate
procedures in place to audit or test tech-
nology they purchase to assess its accuracy,
including on the basis of race, gender, eth-
nicity, and age.
(4) The extent to which the intelligence
community has codified policies governing
the use of facial recognition technology that
adequately prevent adverse impacts on pri-
vacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.
(5) An analysis of the ability of the intel-
ligence community to use facial recognition
technology to identify individuals in a way
that respects constitutional rights, civil
rights, civil liberties, and privacy of such in-
dividuals.
(6) Identification of risks and safeguards to
uphold the constitutional rights, civil rights,
civil liberties, and privacy of individuals, in-
cluding for communities of color and reli-
gious minorities.
(7) Whether such technology is deployed in
public areas or on photos of public areas in
a manner that could raise First Amendment
concerns.
(8) An identification of existing policies,
procedures, or practices that permit the
sharing of facial recognition data and tech-
nology with foreign governments or other
non-United States Government entities.
(9) An identification of measures in place
to protect data security.
(10) An identification of any redress proce-
dures to address complaints in cases where
the use of facial recognition resulted in harm
to an individual.
(11) An analysis of existing transparency,
oversight, and audits of the use of facial rec-
ognition to measure the efficacy of the tech-
nology on an ongoing basis, as measured
against the cost and impact on individual
rights.
(c) FORM.—The report under subsection (a)
shall be submitted in unclassified form, but
may include a classified annex.
(d) FACIAL RECOGNITION DATA DEFINED.—In
this section, the term ‘‘facial recognition
data’’ means any unique attribute or feature
of the face of an end user that is used by fa-
cial recognition technology to assign a
unique, persistent identifier, or for the
unique personal identification of a specific
individual.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 491, the gentlewoman
from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Washington.
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I want to start by recognizing the
work of our chairman, Mr. SCHIFF, on
this bill.
Madam Chair, my amendment would
require Congress to provide much-need-
ed oversight to the intelligence com-
munity’s use of face recognition tech-
nology. The amendment does three
things.
First, it requires the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence to submit a report
to the Intelligence Committees in both
the House and the Senate on the use of
this new technology. This is a critical
step in ensuring that there is a deeper
understanding of the technology here
in Congress and also, appropriate
transparency.
Second, the amendment expresses the
sense of Congress that using this tech-
nology to suppress dissent, or to target
people based on ethnicity, race, gender,
sexual orientation, or religion is con-
trary to our Nation’s values.
And finally, it makes clear that Con-
gress believes that the government
should not sell or transfer face recogni-
tion technology to any country that is
using this technology to suppress
human rights.
I offered this amendment to the In-
telligence Authorization Act because I
am concerned that face recognition
poses grave privacy concerns. As a Na-
tion committed to democratic norms,
including constitutionally-enshrined
rights to freedom of speech and pri-
vacy, it is critical that we ensure that
our national security activities do not
come at the expense of our individual
liberties and our right to privacy. And
thus, it is critical that this body know
exactly how this technology is being
used.
In addition to the civil liberties con-
cerns of those in our country, the tech-
nology does disproportionately impact
people of color. The technology, unfor-
tunately, misidentifies people of color
and women at higher rates than Whites
and men, which undermines its useful-
ness to the intelligence community,
and makes it potentially problematic
for large-scale use.
Finally, my amendment makes clear
that the United States should not be
providing this technology to countries
who are using it to perpetuate human
rights abuses. We should not be selling
or transferring the technologies to
countries like China, who are actively
using this technology to suppress dis-
sent and target minorities, like the
Uighurs, a Muslim minority group.
Although this sense of Congress lays
down an important marker, we do need
to continue to work to ensure that
there are proper controls on the sale
and the transfer of this technology,
and I look forward to doing that with
my colleagues.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5900 July 16, 2019
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
distinguished gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. SCHIFF), the chairman of
the committee.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding.
This amendment expresses a sense of
Congress that conveys our firm opposi-
tion to any use of facial recognition
technology to suppress criticism or dis-
sent, as well as our opposition to the
U.S. Government sale or transfer of fa-
cial recognition technology to coun-
tries using this technology to suppress
human rights.
Critically, the amendment also ac-
knowledges the IC’s unique responsi-
bility to develop robust policies and
procedures that prevent the abuse of
this technology.
To ensure that the intelligence com-
munity is held accountable, the amend-
ment requires the submission of a com-
prehensive report analyzing any use of
facial recognition technology by the
IC, and the associated implications for
privacy and civil liberties, especially
among marginalized communities.
Ms. JAYAPAL’s amendment requires
the intelligence community to estab-
lish clear policies and procedures, en-
hance transparency, and increase over-
sight concerning the applications of
these new capabilities.
Her amendment lays the groundwork
for a thoughtful U.S. response to the
emergence of divisive and disruptive
technologies and how they would fit
into existing civil liberties frame-
works.
Again, I want to thank my colleague
for her work. I am pleased to support
Ms. JAYAPAL’s amendment.
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Chair, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. GARCÍA).
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Madam
Chair, I rise in support of the amend-
ment we have filed to study and limit
the use of facial recognition tech-
nology.
The intelligence community collects
large amounts of data with limited
oversight about how and from whom
data is collected. Facial recognition
technology has shown to be less accu-
rate on nonwhite faces, and its use dis-
proportionately hurts communities of
color because of algorithmic bias.
This amendment studies the poten-
tial for bias and expresses the sense
that people should not be targeted for
their ethnicity, race, or sexual orienta-
tion, or to suppress dissent. Given the
U.S. Government’s history of tracking
protesters and activists, especially in
minority communities, this is impor-
tant.
Congress can and should exercise
Federal oversight of emerging surveil-
lance technologies. For facial recogni-
tion technology, this means our work
is only just beginning. I urge support
for this amendment.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 491, the gentlewoman
from Florida (Mrs. MURPHY) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida.
Mrs. MURPHY. Madam Chair, my
amendment, which I am coleading with
Congresswoman YVETTE CLARKE of New
York, involves a looming threat to
American security and American de-
mocracy from the use of deepfake tech-
nology by our Nation’s adversaries.
As policymakers, we must under-
stand this challenge and put in place a
whole-of-government strategy to ad-
dress it in a way that protects our in-
terests and is consistent with our val-
ues. The U.S. intelligence community
has an important role to play in this
effort.
The House Intelligence Committee,
led by Chairman SCHIFF, recently held
an illuminating and alarming hearing
on deepfakes. As the witnesses at that
hearing testified, technology now en-
ables anyone with a computer, internet
access, and technical skills to create
fabricated and relatively convincing
video and audio recordings that depict
individuals doing or saying things that
they did not do or say.
The technology behind deepfakes is
rapidly evolving. Soon individuals will
be able to create highly realistic and
difficult to debunk video and audio
content. At a time when Americans are
already being inundated, especially on-
line, by a flood of false or misleading
information, deepfake technology has
the potential to make it even harder
for the American public to trust what
it sees and hears.
It is easy to imagine the different
ways in which deepfake technology
could be exploited by America’s foes.
Imagine a Russian intelligence service
creating a video purporting to show an
American Presidential candidate ac-
cepting a bribe or an audio recording
purporting to reveal an American Sec-
retary of State saying something in-
flammatory about an ally. Or imagine
a Chinese-produced video that falsely
depicts the commander of a U.S. mili-
tary unit committing a war crime.
Such efforts, if not quickly exposed as
false by the United States, could create
havoc.
In today’s world, perhaps the biggest
national security threat we face is not
the risk of direct military conflict be-
tween the United States and Russia,
China, Iran, or another adversary. In-
stead, the threat lurks in the gray
space short of kinetic action. It is il-
lustrated by Russian efforts to inter-
vene in the 2016 Presidential election,
most notably in my home State of
Florida. It is the threat from authori-
tarian governments using new tech-
nologies to spread disinformation, sow
discord, create divisions, and cause the
American people to lose faith in our
democratic form of government.
To address this threat, our amend-
ment requires the DNI to prepare a re-
port for Congress on how foreign coun-
tries are using or could use deepfake
technology to harm the United States
and to explain how the intelligence
community is working to develop ap-
propriate countermeasures. This report
will help us to understand the problem
and to combat it more effectively.
We must get this right because the
stakes couldn’t be higher. I urge my
colleagues to support this amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from California (Chairman
SCHIFF).
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding, and I
rise in strong support of this amend-
ment offered by my colleagues from
Florida and New York, who have both
been leaders in this body focused on na-
tional security challenges posed by
deepfake technologies.
We in the Intelligence Committee
held a hearing on this very topic last
month, and the rate at which these ca-
pabilities are evolving is almost as
breathtaking as what they can
produce, high-quality video and other
types of media that convincingly por-
tray individuals saying or doing things
that never happened.
The potential for a foreign adversary
to undermine an election, foment
chaos, or create a national security cri-
sis with a sophisticated digital forgery
means that we need to ensure the intel-
ligence community is fully considering
the wide-ranging implications of
deepfakes, including the capacity of
foreign entities and adversaries to
weaponize machine-generated media.
This report will also give us a de-
tailed picture about how the intel-
ligence community is coordinating ef-
forts, activities, and research sur-
rounding this emerging technology and
if there are lingering gaps in resources
or assignments of responsibility, since
we need to be clear-eyed about how dis-
ruptive and devastating a well-timed
deep fake could be during an election
or a tense diplomatic standoff.
I want to thank my colleague for her
work on this amendment, and I am
very proud to support it.
Mrs. MURPHY. Madam Chair, I urge
support for this amendment, and I
yield back the balance of my time.

section:
SEC. 5ll. SENSE OF CONGRESS AND REPORT ON
IRANIAN EFFORTS IN SYRIA.
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that, regardless of the ultimate
number of United States military personnel
deployed to Syria, it is a vital interest of the
United States to prevent the Islamic Repub-
lic of Iran, Hizbollah, and other Iranian-
backed forces from establishing a strong and
enduring presence in Syria that can be used
to project power in the region and threaten
the United States and its allies, including
Israel.
(b) REPORT.—
(1) REPORT REQUIRED.—Not later than 180
days after the date of enactment of this Act,
the Director of National Intelligence, in co-
ordination with the Secretary of State and
the Secretary of Defense, shall submit to the
appropriate congressional committees a re-
port that assesses—
(A) efforts by Iran to establish long-term
influence in Syria through military, polit-
ical, economic, social, and cultural means;
and
(B) the threat posed by such efforts to
United States interests and allies.
(2) ELEMENTS.—The report under paragraph
(1) shall include each of the following:
(A) An assessment of—
(i) how Iran and Iranian-backed forces, in-
cluding the Islamic Revolutionary Guard
Corps and Hizbollah, have provided or are
currently providing manpower, training,
weapons, equipment, and funding to the Syr-
ian government led by President Bashar al-
Assad;
(ii) the support provided by Iran and
Hizbollah to Shia militias operating in Syria
that are composed of domestic fighters from
Syria and foreign fighters from countries
like Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, and Paki-
stan;
(iii) the threat posed by Iran and Iranian-
backed forces to the al-Tanf garrison and to
areas of northeast Syria that are currently
controlled by local partner forces of the
United States;
(iv) the degree to which efforts of the
United States to sustain and strengthen
Kurdish forces in Syria may undermine the
influence of Iran and Iranian-backed forces
in Syria;
(v) how Iran and Iranian-backed forces
seek to enhance the long-term influence of
such entities in Syria through non-military
means such as purchasing strategic real es-
tate in Syria, constructing Shia religious
centers and schools, securing loyalty from
Sunni tribes in exchange for material assist-
ance, and inducing the Assad government to
open Farsi-language departments at Syrian
universities; and
(vi) whether the prominent role of Iran in
Syria, including the influence of Iran over
government institutions, may increase the
likelihood of the reconstitution of the Is-
lamic State of Iraq and Syria in Syria.
(B) An analysis of—
(i) how Iran is working with the Russian
Federation, Turkey, and other countries to
increase the influence of Iran in Syria; and
(ii) the goals of Iran in Syria, including,
but not limited to, protecting the Assad gov-
ernment, increasing the regional influence of
Iran, threatening Israel from a more proxi-
mate location, building weapon-production
facilities and other military infrastructure,
and securing a land bridge to connect Iran
through Iraq and Syria to the stronghold of
Hizbollah in southern Lebanon.
(C) A description of—
(i) how the efforts of Iran to transfer ad-
vanced weapons to Hizbollah and to establish
a military presence in Syria has led to direct
and repeated confrontations with Israel; and
(ii) the intelligence and military support
that the United States provides to Israel to

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 491, the gentlewoman
from Florida (Mrs. MURPHY) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida.
Mrs. MURPHY. Madam Chair, our
amendment would require the Director
of National Intelligence, in coordina-
tion with the Secretaries of State and
Defense, to prepare a report for Con-
gress on efforts by Iran to establish
long-term influence in Syria using both
hard and soft power and the threat that
this proposes to U.S. interests and al-
lies, including Israel.
Syria’s civil war, which began in 2011,
has brought an influx of Iranian-
backed forces into Syria. Iran and
Syria are both designated by the
United States as state sponsors of ter-
rorism. Their military partnership
dates back decades, and Iran regards
Syria as one of its most important al-
lies.
Iran and Iranian-backed forces, in-
cluding the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps and Hezbollah, have pro-
vided manpower, training, weapons,
and funding to the Syrian Government,
led by President Bashar al-Assad. This
assistance, coupled with support from
Russia, has enabled the Assad govern-
ment to retain or regain territory in
Syria, and the Assad government cur-
rently maintains control over roughly
two-thirds of the country.
Iran’s goals in Syria include pro-
tecting the Assad government, increas-
ing Iran’s regional influence, threat-
ening Israel from a closer location,
building weapon production facilities
and other military infrastructure, and
securing a land bridge that would con-
nect Iran to Hezbollah’s stronghold in
southern Lebanon via Iraq and Syria.
It is clear that Iran is seeking long-
term influence in Syria and is pursuing
this objective through military, polit-
ical, and social means.
Iran’s effort to establish a military
presence in Syria has led to repeated
confrontations with Israel. In February
of 2018, Israel shot down an Iranian
drone flying over Israeli territory and
then targeted the base in Syria from
which the drone was launched. In May
2018, Israel launched strikes against
Iranian military installations in Syria.
Iran responded by firing missiles at
Israeli positions in the Golan Heights,
and Israel then targeted nearly all of
Iran’s military infrastructure in Syria.
Iranian and Iranian-backed forces
also seek to enhance their influence in
Syria through nonmilitary means, such
as purchasing strategic real estate,
constructing Shia religious centers and
schools, securing loyalty from Sunni
tribes, and inducing the Assad govern-
ment to open Farsi language depart-
ments at Syrian universities.
In a startling move, President Trump
has proposed to withdraw all or most
U.S. forces from Syria, a proposal I
view as a profound mistake. But re-
gardless of the number of U.S. troops
deployed to Syria, I believe it is a vital
U.S. interest to prevent Iran,
Hezbollah, and other Iranian-backed
forces from establishing an enduring
presence in Syria.
Our amendment would require the
DNI to assess how Iran is using hard
and soft power to gain long-term influ-
ence in Syria. Among other things, the
IC would examine how U.S. efforts to
strengthen Kurdish forces in Syria
could undermine Iran, how the U.S.
helps Israel identify threats from Iran
and Syria, and how Iran’s influence
over Syrian institutions could increase
the likelihood that the Islamic State
will reconstitute itself inside Syria.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Chair, I
claim the time in opposition to the
amendment, though I am not opposed
to it.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Illinois is
recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Chair, I
rise in support of the Murphy-Schnei-
der amendment that makes abundantly
clear it is of the utmost importance to
prevent Iran from establishing any en-
during presence in Syria.
The amendment also requires the Di-
rector of National Intelligence to re-
port on Iran’s efforts to establish a
foothold in Syria on the threat this
poses to the United States and our al-
lies, in particular Israel.
Madam Chair, I stood before Congress
in the last Congress urging support for
my amendment to require a report on
Iran’s support for proxy forces in Syria
and Lebanon, and I am pleased that
this report remains in this bill. Today
we are building on this important ef-
fort with the Murphy-Schneider
amendment.
I thank my good friend from Florida,
STEPHANIE MURPHY, for her leadership
on this issue.
Iran is a bad actor that has spread its
maligned influence and continued to
engage in destabilizing activities
throughout the Middle East region, as
well as beyond. The Iranian regime has
and continues to establish deep ties
within Syria through military, polit-
ical, economic, social, and cultural
means. This is a dangerous behavior
that must be checked. Iran must not be
allowed to maintain a permanent foot-
hold in Syria that threatens our allies
and stability in the region.
To stand up to Iran, we must first un-
derstand the full extent of Iran’s ac-
tivities in Syria, and that is what this
amendment does. I look forward to see-
ing this report and engaging on how we
can prevent Iran from maintaining a
permanent presence in Syria.
I hope my colleagues will join me in
supporting this important amendment,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mrs. MURPHY. Madam Chair, I urge
support for the amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.

Madam Chair, I rise today urging
adoption of my amendment, which

law regarding acts of international ter-
rorism, providing support to terrorists,
or aiding terrorists.
The underlying bill helps keep our
country safe by ensuring the intel-
ligence community has the resources
and authorities it needs to do its job. It
also makes sure the intelligence com-
munity can improve and adapt to to-
day’s rapidly changing threats and
technologies by improving the collec-
tion and analytic capabilities against
our adversaries like China, Russia,
Iran, and North Korea.
My amendment makes it crystal
clear that our country will remain
tough on international terrorism.

SEC. 7lll REPORT ON INTERNATIONAL MO-
BILE SUBSCRIBER IDENTITY-CATCH-
ERS AND UNITED STATES NATIONAL
SECURITY.
(a) REPORT REQUIRED.—Not later than 180
days after the date of the enactment of this
Act, the Director of National Intelligence, in
consultation with the Secretary of Homeland
Security, the Director of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, and the heads of other
agencies the Director of National Intel-
ligence determines appropriate, shall submit
to the congressional intelligence committees
a report describing—
(1) the threats that international mobile
subscriber identity-catchers pose to national
security and, specifically, the safety and se-
curity of Government personnel;
(2) the prevalence of international mobile
subscriber identity-catchers used by both
foreign actors and domestic law enforcement
within the United States;
(3) actions taken by Federal agencies, as of
the date of the report, to remove or neu-
tralize international mobile subscriber iden-
tity-catchers installed by foreign entities,
with a primary focus on the National Capital
Region (as defined in section 2674(f) of title
10, United States Code);
(4) policy recommendations for Congress to
consider that would empower law enforce-
ment and the intelligence community to
counter such foreign intelligence operations
while minimizing interference with legiti-
mate domestic law enforcement operations;
(5) the extent to which private entities, as
well as Federal entities not primarily re-
sponsible for national security or homeland
security, are able to remove, neutralize, or
otherwise render ineffective international
mobile subscriber identity-catchers; and
(6) recommendations for new software pro-
grams, or the hardening of existing software
programs, to reduce mobile phone suscepti-
bility to international mobile subscriber
identity-catchers.
(b) FORM.—To the extent practicable, the
report shall be submitted in an unclassified,
law enforcement sensitive form for the pur-
poses of distribution to other congressional
committees, but may also include a classi-
fied annex.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 491, the gentleman
from Illinois (Mr. KINZINGER) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Illinois.
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Chair, my
amendment is very simple. It would re-
quire that the Director of National In-
telligence and other relevant agencies
report to Congress on the threat that
international mobile subscriber iden-
tity catchers, also referred to as ‘‘cell-
site simulators’’ or under the brand
name ‘‘StingRay,’’ pose to U.S. Gov-
ernment personnel and national secu-
rity.
In addition to providing this report,
the DNI would need to provide rec-
ommendations to Congress regarding
possible policy changes to counter
these devices.
IMSI catchers send signals to mobile
phones that appear to be coming from
legitimate mobile networks. Once con-
nected, the phones are used to track
the locations of the users, which can be
seen by whoever is controlling the
IMSI catcher. The more advanced
versions of these cell devices allow
their owners even to access messages
and phone call data.
Many of us were shocked when a re-
port came out last year that the De-
partment of Homeland Security had
found these devices around the na-
tional capital region. Even more con-
cerning was that many of these were
located around sensitive government
buildings.
My amendment would help Congress
understand the proliferation of these
devices around our Nation, with a focus
on their prevalence in the national cap-
ital region. We need to know which ac-
tors, foreign or domestic, are deploying
them and what Congress can do to en-
sure the safekeeping of our national se-
curity apparatus.
Madam Chair, I urge support for this
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Section 2302 of title 5, United States Code,

‘‘Congress (including any committee of Con-
gress),’’ before ‘‘the Special Counsel’’; and

Ms. HILL of California. Madam
Chair, I yield myself as much time as I
may consume. I rise in support of an
amendment to H.R. 3494.
I believe strongly in the principle of
government transparency. It is some-
thing I ran on and talk about. I have
spent my time in Congress working to
deliver on accountability and trans-
parency as the vice chair of the Over-
sight and Reform Committee and
through other legislation.
Today, I am introducing this amend-
ment to clarify what Congress already
believes to be the law, that Federal
whistleblowers have the ability to
make protected disclosures to the ap-
propriate congressional committee of
jurisdiction, not just members of the
Intelligence Committee.
At a time like this, we cannot afford
ambiguity. This technical change will
allow congressional committees to con-
duct their business in a more timely
and effective manner.
This amendment is not my first ef-
fort to protect whistleblowers, nor will
it be my last. Those with the courage
to stand up and say something is not
right should have every single protec-
tion that we, as Congress, can offer to
them.
Madam Chair, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this amendment,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.

the 37 extremist-related murders docu-
mented in 2017. Indeed, that is a 26 per-
cent jump in 1 year.
Given the disturbing rise of plots and
incidents of domestic terrorism nation-
wide, I am pleased with the provision
in this bill requiring that a joint report
on domestic terrorism be submitted to
Congress each year by the DNI, the FBI
Director, and the Under Secretary of
Homeland Security for Intelligence and
Analysis.
My amendment requires that this
comprehensive report on domestic ter-
rorism be made available on the public
websites not just of the National Coun-
terterrorism Center but also of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation and
the Department of Homeland Security.
The amendment also specifies that
the report should be made publicly
available no later than 30 days after
submission to the appropriate congres-
sional committees. We can’t let some-
thing this important be delayed over
and over again.
We need to ensure that this report is
accessible not just to promote trans-
parency but also to help policymakers
nationwide recognize the scope of the
threat that domestic terrorism poses
and to encourage academic research
necessary to understand the scourge of
domestic terrorism better so that we
might bring it to an end once and for
all. I am talking about policymakers
on the local and the State level as well
as the Federal level.
Madam Chair, I thank, in particular,
Chairman SCHIFF and his staff for their

Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, as the

The text of the amendment is as fol-

new paragraph:
(7) An assessment and identification of the
technological and financial support provided
by United States-based companies, including
technological support for the development of
facial recognition capabilities or tech-
nologies for digital surveillance, social con-
trol, or censorship, and financial support, in-
cluding from financial institutions, invest-
ment vehicles, and pension funds, to China-
based companies or Chinese government en-
tities providing material support to the dig-
ital surveillance or repression of Uyghur and
other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang by the
Xinjiang authorities.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 491, the gentleman
from California (Mr. SCHIFF) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, I rise to
support this amendment, which adds
an additional requirement to section
502, a report on the repression of ethnic
Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang re-
gion of the People’s Republic of China.
The human rights crisis underway in
Xinjiang is staggering in scale. Open-
source analysis based on extensive re-
views of satellite imagery and Chinese
Government documents has concluded
that as many as 1.5 million Muslims
could be held in internment camps by
the Chinese Government.
Despite this body of evidence, the ex-
ecutive branch has rebuffed attempts
to clearly describe the scope and scale
of this crisis.
H.R. 3494 calls for a comprehensive
U.S. Government assessment that ad-
dresses the number of persons detained,
a description of forced labor practices
in the camps, and an assessment of the
surveillance, detection, and control
methods associated with China’s new
high-tech policing model.
Mr. MALINOWSKI’s amendment adds
an additional requirement for the in-
telligence community to assess and
identify the technological and finan-
cial support provided by U.S.-based
companies to the Chinese Govern-
ment’s repressive operations in
Xinjiang.
In light of the alarming public re-
ports detailing cooperation between
prominent U.S. companies and foreign
companies aiding and abetting the Chi-
nese Communist Party’s surveillance
state, this amendment could not be
timelier.
Madam Chair, I thank my colleagues,

tireless work to support human rights.

Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam
Chair, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Madam Chair, I rise in support of my
amendment to H.R. 3494.
Our law enforcement officers stand
on the front lines of defending the
American people from domestic and
international terrorist threats. It is
our job as Congress to make sure that
they have the most up-to-date informa-
tion about the evolving threats posed
by terrorism, including the use of ad-
vanced conventional weapons.
One such evolving threat is the dan-
ger posed by terrorist use of conven-
tional and advanced conventional
weapons, including unregistered weap-
ons that lack serial numbers.
To address this issue, my amendment
to the Intelligence Authorization Act
will require the Department of Home-
land Security to conduct an annual as-
sessment of the domestic and inter-
national terrorist threats posed by con-
ventional weapons as well as advanced
conventional weapons.
This is a simple, straightforward
amendment that seeks to put impor-
tant information about terrorist
threats in the hands of our law enforce-
ment officers.
Madam Chair, law enforcement needs
to have the information they need to
understand these threats. The assess-
ment of the terrorist threat posed by
conventional weapons and advanced
conventional weapons that I call for in
this amendment will do just that.
Additionally, this assessment will
then be shared with Congress and with
law enforcement so that our frontline
officers have the information they need
to understand these evolving threats.

leagues to support my amendment, and
I yield back the balance of my time.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 491, the gentleman
from New York (Mr. ROSE) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New York.
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam
Chair, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Madam Chair, I rise to offer an
amendment to title VII of H.R. 3494,
entitled, ‘‘Reports and Other Matters.’’
As a combat veteran, I can tell you
firsthand that intelligence drives oper-
ations, and it is imperative to the secu-
rity of our homeland that the U.S.
maintains its superiority when it
comes to intelligence. However, a
growing concern I have is when our
former or retired intelligence profes-
sionals choose to later work for a for-
eign government.
We saw it with former NSA employ-
ees working as hackers for the United
Arab Emirates’ Project Raven. Inter-
views and documents showed that the
NSA’s surveillance techniques were
central to the country’s monitoring ef-
forts.
Reporting showed that American ex-
intelligence personnel would target the
UAE Government’s opponents online.
This information, provided to them by
the country’s NSA equivalent, didn’t
just target terrorists, but also human
rights activists and journalists, those
whom the UAE deemed unfavorable.
It is concerning when our best and
brightest go off to conduct or advise on
intelligence operations for foreign gov-
ernments that, in some cases, are
against the very people our American
ideals protect. We need to understand
the nature and impact of this expertise
in the hands of a foreign government.
What are the homeland security impli-
cations of this?
My amendment will do just that. It
requires the Director of National Intel-
ligence, in coordination with other in-
telligence community partners, to con-
duct an annual assessment of the
homeland security vulnerabilities asso-
ciated with former intelligence com-
munity employees providing intel-
ligence assistance to a foreign govern-
ment.
Madam Chair, the invaluable train-
ing, tradecraft, and expertise developed
by former or retired intelligence pro-
fessionals to keep our country safe, to
keep Americans safe, now in the hands
of a foreign government for their ben-
efit is absolutely chilling.
My amendment will tackle these con-
cerns head-on with an annual assess-
ment of any homeland security vulner-
abilities that may be associated with
this capability, cultivated from years
of service to our country, now being
provided to foreign governments.
Madam Chair, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support my amendment, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. ROSE).
The amendment was agreed to.

U.S.C. 1189) with connections to the Govern-
ment of Iran, as determined by the Director.
(2) FORM.—The report under paragraph (1)
shall be submitted in unclassified form, but
may contain a classified annex.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 491, the gentleman
from Indiana (Mr. PENCE) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Indiana.
Mr. PENCE. Madam Chair, I rise in
support of my amendment, which is
deeply personal.
Madam Chair, I was assigned to the
3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines. In 1983, my
battalion was ordered to Beirut, Leb-
anon.
On October 23 of that same year, an
Iranian national affiliated with
Hezbollah, a terror group founded,
trained, and financially supported by
the Iranian regime, drove a truck bomb
into the U.S. barracks in Beirut, kill-
ing 241 servicemen, 220 of which were
my fellow marines.
It is by the grace of God that I am
standing here today. My battalion
shipped out 10 days before the bombing.
I was lucky. I was able to come home
to my wife, who was expecting our first
child, and my family in Columbus, In-
diana.
As proud U.S. marines, Congressman
GALLEGO and I authored this bipar-
tisan, bicameral legislation to provide
a sliver of justice for the 241 heroes
who were not as lucky that day.
Madam Chair, our amendment is sim-
ple. The OORAH Act would allow the
families of the bombing victims to exe-
cute on the $1.6 billion in Iranian funds
currently held by a European-based
firm. These funds were laundered
through New York before making their
way to Europe, where they sit just out-
side the hand of justice.
Regardless of the party you con-
ference with or the district you rep-
resent, we can all agree that terrorists
and those who support them finan-
cially must be held accountable for
their actions.
When I joined the Marines in 1979, I
made a promise of Semper Fidelis.
Semper Fi is a lifelong commitment
held by every marine for the corps and
America, a promise reciprocated by the
corps to all marines.
Madam Chair, we must uphold this
promise. Marines are the first to fight,
and this time we are fighting for the
Gold Star families who lost their loved
ones.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment and stand
with Congressman GALLEGO and me
and our colleagues in the Senate to
honor the faith and loyalty of the 241
American servicemen who made the ul-
timate sacrifice.
Madam Chair, OORAH stands for Our
Obligation to Recognize American He-
roes, or as the Marines say, OORAH.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Chair, I claim
the time in opposition, although I am
not opposed to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Arizona is
recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Chair, I rise
in proud support of the amendment
sponsored by fellow marine and public
servant, Mr. PENCE.
October 23, 1983, remains seared in
the memory of all marines. On that
day, over 300 innocent people were
killed in a surprise terrorist attack
sponsored by the Government of Iran.
Most of the people killed 36 years ago
were my brothers. They were U.S. ma-
rines. They were serving our country
and doing their best to preserve the
peace in war-torn Lebanon.
We know that the wheels of justice
turn slowly, Madam Chair. It took over
35 years for victims to get traction in
U.S. courts. But now that they are get-
ting that traction and winning judg-
ments, marines in Congress are here to
help to ensure that Iranian funds can-
not be hidden from them in secret for-
eign bank accounts.
This amendment helps the families of
those killed and wounded by making
sure that Iran is held liable for this at-
tack. It makes it harder for Iran to
hide money in overseas bank accounts
when it should be paying for the pain
and suffering of its victims. It shows
that, even 36 years after the attack, we
have not forgotten, and it once again
proves that U.S. marines remain ‘‘no
better friend, no worse enemy.’’
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. PENCE. Madam Chair, I thank
the chairman and ranking member for
their leadership and my colleague and
fellow marine from Arizona (Mr.
GALLEGO) for his faithful service and
unwavering support on this legislation.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. PENCE).
The amendment was agreed to.

from California.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, the Intel-
ligence Committee has invested consid-
erable time and focus the last 3 years
to study the painful lessons of foreign
interference in our democratic system.
Ms. SLOTKIN’s amendment will en-
hance the work of the committee by
compelling the Director of National In-
telligence to identify barriers that pre-
vent the intelligence community from
fully understanding the scope and im-
pact of these threats.
Our adversaries are committed to
employing a whole-of-government ap-
proach to execute their plan to disrupt
our democratic system. In order to de-
feat these efforts, we must understand
the scope of the threat. We must enlist
our intelligence community to identify
the scope of and the means by which
our adversaries are attempting to
achieve their goal.
This amendment sets forth a frame-
work by which the DNI will report to
Congress on these threats and identify
whether there are gaps in the IC’s au-
thorities that hinder its ability to find,
assess, and enable action on foreign in-
fluence campaigns.
Madam Chair, I believe this is an im-
portant amendment. I encourage my
colleagues to support it, as well as the
underlying bill, and I yield back the
balance of my time.

Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chairwoman,
we are all too familiar with the influ-
ence operations perpetrated by the
Russian Government during the 2016
U.S. election.
As the IC articulated in its January
2017 intelligence community assess-
ment, those operations were merely
the most recent in a long history of ef-
forts to undermine the liberal demo-
cratic order. We must remain vigilant
and fully informed about the oper-
ations executed by the Government of
Russia to influence and undermine our
democratic system.
To that end, this amendment re-
quires an annual report from the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence containing
information about the influence oper-
ations and campaigns in the U.S. by
the Russian Federation. I support the
amendment and urge my colleagues to
do the same.

have offered to the Damon Paul Nelson
and Matthew Young Pollard Intel-
ligence Authorization Act.
I would like to thank Representative
NUNES and Representative SCHIFF for
their work on this important legisla-
tion.
My proposed amendment includes
within the report on 5G technology,
the threat to the national security of
the United States posed by tele-
communication companies that are
subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign
adversary; namely, China, Russia, Iran,
North Korea, and Syria.
This will cover threats from acquisi-
tions, importations, transfers, or use of
communications technology by any
person subject to the jurisdiction of
the United States that involved tech-
nology designed, developed or con-
trolled by a foreign adversary.
As globalization continues to shape
the world we live in, it is increasingly
important that the United States
prioritizes the security of our cyber
networks and infrastructure. Today,
China controls over 60 percent of the
5G networks in the world.
In 2012, the House Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence deemed
telecommunication companies, Huawei
and ZTE national security threats.
Seven years later, these companies
continue to harm and undermine U.S.
cybersecurity interests. Should the
U.S. continue to let these companies
and others like them continue to pro-
liferate our networks, we are putting
the security of our citizens at risk and
our national security.
We must continue our maximum
pressure campaign on these malicious
companies until we can ensure that
these actors do not pose threats to our
national security.

Mr. YOHO. Madam Chairwoman, I
rise today to offer an amendment to
H.R. 3494. My amendment No. 28 would
require the FBI Director, in coordina-
tion with the Under Secretary of
Homeland Security for Intelligence and
Analysis to submit a report on domes-
tic terrorist activity in the United
States to the congressional intel-
ligence committees.
The report will detail:
Activities conducted by domestic ter-
rorist groups that restrict free speech
using violence or intimidation;
Activities conducted by domestic ter-
rorist groups that are a danger to
human life and are a violation of the
criminal laws of the United States or
any State; and
The prevalence of any domestic ter-
rorist group within the United States
and abroad or any group that claimed
to be domestic yet have ties to foreign
groups like al-Qaida or other terrorist
organizations.
There are abhorrent groups of people
within the United States today whose
reasons for existence is violence. They
do not respect the rule of law or the
values of America. Yes, we have the
First Amendment that allows for free-
dom of speech, religion, and assembly,
but with those freedoms, one must ex-
ercise responsibility.
They seek to inflict harm on Ameri-
cans or specific groups of Americans
because of their race, religion, personal
beliefs, or other reasons.
We have seen this evil in recent years
with the deadly attacks on the Tree of
Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, the at-
tack on the Mother Emanuel AME
Church in Charleston, and, sadly, too
many more.
Moreover, we have seen violence used
by groups that restrict free speech,
most recently with the attack on Andy
Ngo in Portland by the group Antifa.
We are the most extraordinary Na-
tion because of our belief in and the ad-
herence to the idea ‘‘that all men are
created equal, that they are endowed
by their creator with certain
unalienable rights, that among these
are life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap-
piness,’’ with the rule of law included.
Groups that threaten these notions
threaten our country and our very
form of government. It is imperative
that Congress be informed of domestic
terrorist activities and understand the
prevalence of these activities.
By keeping Congress informed of
these activities, we, as legislators, may
continue to ensure laws are appro-
priately crafted to protect all Ameri-
cans and safeguard the liberties we
hold dear.
I encourage my colleagues to support
this amendment, and I yield back the
balance of my time.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to

from Minnesota (Ms. OMAR) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Minnesota.
Ms. OMAR. Madam Chairwoman, my
amendment mandates reporting on the
foreign governments with whom we
share access to the Terrorist Screening
Database. The database is shared with
more than 60 foreign governments, in-
cluding countries with appalling
human rights records, such as Saudi
Arabia and China.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5909
July 16, 2019
An FBI official has acknowledged in
sworn testimony that it has never
stopped sharing watch-list information
with a foreign government because of
that government’s human rights
abuses. Many of the people who are in-
cluded in the database have never been
charged with a crime, and, yet, we
share sensitive information about them
with the same government that mur-
dered Jamal Khashoggi.
I have also received credible reports
that there have been Uighurs added to
the database at the request of the Chi-
nese Government. I ask the Chair to
think about that.
There is universal outrage in Wash-
ington about the treatment of the
Uighur population in China. What are
we talking about?
Let’s be clear. These are the precur-
sors to genocide. And while it is hap-
pening, while Members of both sides of
the aisle and the Secretary of State are
condemning what is happening, we are
allowing the Chinese Government to
add Uighurs to the Terrorist Screening
Database. We are allowing them to
track Uighurs in the United States.
This is probably the most appalling
aspect of our sharing this information
with governments that violate human
rights, but it is not the only appalling
aspect. One thing we know for sure in
almost two decades that we have been
fighting the war on terror, is that dic-
tators have been more than happy to
call whoever opposes them a terrorist.
The Saudis, whose family has direct,
proven, and clear financial links to al-
Qaida, are given access to this data-
base. The Saudis, who have rounded up
human rights activists, tortured them,
mass executed them, and claiming they
are terrorists, get to add people on this
list. It is entirely possible that they
get to add American citizens to this
list.
This isn’t compatible with a free so-
ciety. It isn’t compatible with our es-
sential concepts of civil liberties. It is
important to note that the evidentiary
standard for being placed in the data-
base is very low. The government only
needs reasonable suspicion that some-
one is involved in terrorism, which is
not even enough to charge someone
with a crime.
It is also significant that individuals
added to this database are not in-
formed of their placements and have
suffered preventable harms as a result.
So my amendment asks some basic
questions, questions that we as Mem-
bers of Congress have not only a right
to, but a responsibility to ask.
I ask my colleagues to support this
amendment. If they are concerned
about civil liberties, they should be
concerned about this. If they are con-
cerned about human rights abroad,
they should be concerned about this.
And no matter how they feel about the
database itself, this amendment asks
that we need answers in order to make
informed decisions about our national
security policy.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from California (Mr.
SCHIFF), the chairman.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding to me.
This amendment requires a report on
a number of civil liberties questions re-
garding the Terrorist Screening Data-
base. We need to structure our counter-
terrorism programs by thinking about
not only what we can do and what is
constitutional to do, but what we
should be doing so that we get the
maximum security benefit along with
the maximum privacy.
Our aim is a healthy equilibrium be-
tween security and privacy. With that
in mind, I support my colleague’s
amendment which will assist the Intel-
ligence Committee with its oversight
and inform the public about how the
privacy security balance is being
struck.
I want to thank Ms. OMAR for her
work, and I encourage my colleagues to
support her amendment.
Ms. OMAR. Madam Chair, I am
thankful to the chairman and ranking
member for their support, and with
that, I yield back the balance of my
time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. OMAR).
The amendment was agreed to.
The Acting CHAIR. The Chair under-
stands that amendment No. 30 will not
be offered.
AMENDMENT NO. 31 OFFERED BY MR. CROW
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 31 printed
in part B of House Report 116–154.
Mr. CROW. Madam Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of title VII, add the following
new section:
SEC. 708. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON AMERICANS
AND FOREIGN INDIVIDUALS WHO
CONTRIBUTE TO THE NATIONAL SE-
CURITY OF THE UNITED STATES
WHO ARE HELD CAPTIVE.
It is the sense of Congress that the United
States Government should—
(1) prioritize the safety and protection for
all Americans, including citizens of the
United States who are wrongfully detained
by foreign governments;
(2) make every effort to bring these Ameri-
cans back home; and
(3) provide assistance to and, as appro-
priate, advocate on behalf of foreign individ-
uals detained abroad who contributed di-
rectly to the national security of the United
States.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 491, the gentleman
from Colorado (Mr. CROW) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Colorado.
Mr. CROW. Madam Chairwoman, I
rise today to offer an amendment to
highlight the importance of honoring
our commitments, to keep Americans
and those who serve our country
around the world safe.
Unfortunately, by virtue of being
Americans and representing the values
of our country, our citizens are some-
times targeted by adversarial countries
and wrongfully detained. In those situ-
ations, we must leverage all available
tools and resources at our disposal to
secure their safe return. We must em-
ploy a whole-of-government approach
to return Americans wrongfully de-
tained in foreign countries back to
their families.
b 2145
We are a nation founded on the prin-
ciple of due process. We must hold
other countries to the same expecta-
tions of equal treatment under the law.
We must also support the foreign na-
tionals who put their lives and the
lives of their families at risk to con-
tribute to our national security. We
owe these extraordinary individuals
our gratitude for their assistance, par-
ticularly in light of the dangers that
they often face. Despite precautions, in
some cases, their contributions have
led to their detainment or imprison-
ment.
One of our greatest strengths is the
network of individuals and nations
that want to help us because they can
rely on us to keep our promises. That
is why we must continue to stand by
our commitments to our partners, par-
ticularly when they are persecuted for
their contributions to the U.S.
Simply stated, we must honor our
commitments to those who have stood
by us.
This amendment asserts the impor-
tance of this position, not just because
it is in the best interests of the United
States, but because it is the right thing
to do, and that moral responsibility is
an essential virtue of being an Amer-
ican.
Madam Chair, I yield 30 seconds to
the gentleman from California (Mr.
SCHIFF).
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Securing the safe release of Ameri-
cans held abroad is a top and urgent
priority. Congress can play a role in
keeping this issue at the forefront of
public consciousness.
With that in mind, I salute my col-
league for all of his efforts. I thank Mr.
CROW for drafting this sense of Con-
gress that keeps the spotlight on this
important issue.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support the amendment and the un-
derlying bill.
Mr. CROW. Madam Chair, in closing,
I urge my colleagues to support my
amendment and uphold our obligations
to our fellow Americans and partners
around the world. We are a country
that keeps its promises, and we must
do so well into the future.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. CROW).
The amendment was agreed to.

H5910 July 16, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, I move
that the Committee do now rise.
The motion was agreed to.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.
OMAR) having assumed the chair, Mrs.
MURPHY, Acting Chair of the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on the state
of the Union, reported that that Com-
mittee, having had under consideration
the bill (H.R. 3494) to authorize appro-
priations for fiscal year 2020 for intel-
ligence and intelligence-related activi-
ties of the United States Government,
the Community Management Account,
and the Central Intelligence Agency
Retirement and Disability System, and

RECOGNIZING THE FRANK
VARISCHETTI FOUNDATION AND
HONORING COACH ANDY EVANKO
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, on June 28, I had the
privilege of attending the fourth an-
nual Frank Varischetti All-Star Foot-
ball Game in Brockway, Pennsylvania.
The Frank Varischetti Foundation
hosts this annual event with support
from the Brockway Gridiron Associa-
tion and the Brockway Area School
District. The event brings the region
together for a great gridiron game in
support of the academic futures of
local students.
In addition to showcasing the best
football talent in the region, $1,000
scholarships are awarded by game
sponsors. This year, I was proud to rep-
resent many players from Pennsylva-
nia’s 15th Congressional District in
awarding 20 scholarships.
The event also recognized the late
coach Andy Evanko, who passed away
last month from ALS, with a moment
of silence. Coach Evanko was a staple
in his community and coached the
Curwensville Golden Tide football
team from 2000 to 2018 with an impres-
sive career record, winning more than
70 percent of his games as head coach.
These young men and their coaches
truly exhibited the value of hard work
and the importance of good sportsman-
ship.
f
STOP UN-AMERICAN RHETORIC
(Mr. ABRAHAM asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam Speaker, I
am concerned about the rhetoric I have
continually heard from the other side.
I believe that all Members of this body
love our country, but some statements
from this House are un-American in
tone, such as comparing ICE detention
centers to concentration camps and the
Holocaust. There have been sugges-
tions that terrorist organizations were
justified in attacking our great Nation.
Members have even used language ex-
pressing how ashamed they are of this
country.
I am fed up with those continued at-
tacks on the very foundations of this
great Nation.
I remind my colleagues that we, as
Americans, pledge allegiance to the
flag of the United States of America.
We must not use rhetoric that leads
other nations to question our loyalties.
Madam Speaker, I am not afraid to
stand up for freedom, liberty, and jus-
tice. I am proud to be an American,
and I will defend the values that make
this Nation great until the day I die.
f
ADJOURNMENT
Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam Speaker, I
move that the House do now adjourn.
The motion was agreed to; accord-
ingly (at 9 o’clock and 51 minutes

House adjourned until tomorrow,
Wednesday, July 17, 2019, at 10 a.m. for

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF APOLLO 11
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President,
July 20 marks 50 years since Neil Arm-
strong took ‘‘one small step for man’’
and, for the first time in human his-
tory, walked on the Moon. The Apollo
missions should be remembered for
generations to come as a triumph for
innovation, for hard work, and for the
American spirit. As we commemorate
the mission to the moon that captured
the world 50 years ago, we should look
with anticipation to the next ‘‘giant
leap for mankind,’’ and thus work to
ensure that the United States remains
at the forefront of innovation and tech-
nology.
Madam President, I yield the floor.
f
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
f
ECONOMIC GROWTH
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
economic data continue to confirm
what we have been hearing from Amer-
ican workers and job creators for 2
years now: This is a pro-worker, pro-
family, pro-opportunity economic mo-
ment. Hardly a day goes by without
new headlines highlighting the new
prosperity in communities that the
last administration’s policies over-
looked and the red-hot market for
American workers.
Since January 2017, Republican poli-
cies have focused on letting the Amer-
ican people control more of their own
money and letting American businesses
create jobs more easily.
So what are the results? On our
watch, unemployment has fallen to
near 50-year lows and stayed there.
Underemployment has fallen too.
Wages are growing. Month after
month, we have had more job openings
nationwide than Americans looking for
work. Specifically, there are currently
about 1.6 million more job openings
than Americans looking for work, the
widest margin ever recorded.
Now, these aren’t Washington accom-
plishments. They are the American
people’s accomplishments, but public
policy can certainly change the condi-
tions. Government can either create
the conditions that help lead to success
or to stagnation.
For example, bad public policies
under the Obama administration help
to explain why the insufficient and un-
fair economic ‘‘recovery’’ left so many
places behind. High taxes, heavy regu-
lation, and a hostile climate for busi-
ness—these things all add up. They
took a real toll in many places.
Take my home State of Kentucky,
for example. Kentucky is proud of our
diverse economy. We are proud of our
great healthcare and aviation sectors.
We are proud that we are a tourist des-
tination. It turns out that Bourbon and
horse races are a winning combination.
We also take huge pride in the kinds
of industries that liberal policies tend
to either forget about or actively work
against. I am talking about manufac-
turing and agriculture and mining and
coal-fired electricity—the things that
keep the lights on in America’s heart-
land. We could not be prouder of the
huge role these sectors play in our
Commonwealth.
So it is not surprising that leftwing
policies dreamt up in places like New
York and San Francisco, for places like
New York and San Francisco, were not
too kind to Kentucky—growth that
was too slow, jobs that were hard to
come by. Some so-called experts said it
was just the ‘‘new normal,’’ but we
knew better. We knew Kentucky could
get back on track if we could only get
a fair shot and fewer hurdles from
Washington. We needed the govern-
ment to stop creating headwinds and
maybe even create a few tailwinds.
That is exactly what happened over the
last 21⁄2 years.
Since January 2017, Republicans in
Congress have partnered with the
Trump administration to get our Na-
tion’s opportunity economy going and
growing again—for everyone. We
passed the first comprehensive over-
haul of the Federal Tax Code in more
than a generation. We cut regulations
that had reduced liberty and stifled our
competitiveness. We helped American
workers and entrepreneurs hang up a
big, bright neon sign saying ‘‘Open for
Business.’’ And—no surprise here—
working Americans have taken the ball
and they have run with it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4830 July 16, 2019
I have already read the national sta-
tistics. I am even prouder about this.
Instead of being left behind, Kentucky
is helping to lead the charge. The
State’s unemployment rate has hit and
sustained its lowest level on record.
Again, that is recordbreaking low un-
employment.
Last year, Governor Bevin helped
Kentucky to welcome more than $5.3
billion of planned business investment.
This new growth isn’t just con-
centrated in urban areas. Rural com-
munities in the Bluegrass are seeing
more jobs, investment, and expansion
as well.
Of course, it takes more than 2 years
to unwind the mistakes of the past.
Parts of Kentucky are still struggling
from the effects of liberal policies, and
this Republican Senate, the adminis-
tration, and leaders in Frankfort are
laser-focused on continuing to invest in
and fight for recovery.
In many communities, particularly
in rural Kentucky, the lingering pain
has been hard to shake—the damage to
the coal industry, the devastation
caused by opioid and substance abuse.
So more work is certainly needed, and
I am honored to lead the charge in
Washington to help Kentuckians con-
front these challenges.
Through programs like the Appa-
lachian Regional Commission and the
abandoned mine land pilot program, we
are investing hundreds of millions of
dollars into struggling areas and out-
of-work Americans. In Eastern Ken-
tucky, Congressman HAL ROGERS and I
have partnered with local organiza-
tions to secure Federal resources for
everything from skills training to
water infrastructure improvements.
I have helped to secure tens of mil-
lions of dollars to aid the retraining ef-
forts of the Eastern Kentucky Con-
centrated Employment Program and
job-creating programs like the Ken-
tucky Highlands Community Develop-
ment Corporation. We have also se-
cured grants to bolster good jobs, sup-
port the environment, attract tourism,
and promote healthy lifestyles.
These are just a few examples from
just one State. There are stories like
this all over our country. While the
previous administration left these men
and women behind, Republicans recog-
nize their skills and their drive. We are
investing in their futures.
f
TREATIES
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
speaking of economic growth and de-
velopment, the Senate will soon turn
our attention to a number of bilateral
tax treaties with important U.S. trad-
ing partners. We have these kinds of
agreements in place to reduce tax eva-
sion, tax avoidance, and unfair double
taxation of U.S. citizens and businesses
who conduct businesses overseas. The
four we will consider this week are
agreements with Spain, Switzerland,
Japan, and Luxembourg.
The U.S. Government and each of
these foreign governments have pains-
takingly negotiated updates to existing
agreements about how certain kinds of
commerce would be taxed and which
country will tax them. In short, Senate
ratification of these protocols would
mean less confusion, more certainty,
and, often, fewer taxes for U.S. job cre-
ators—and, by the way, a simpler rule
book for overseas investors who want
to invest their money here. Fairer
treatment for our own American job
creators and more enticement for for-
eign investment to head to our coun-
try—that is what we would call a win-
win.
We are talking about a serious eco-
nomic impact. In addition to the four
countries we are tackling this week,
there are three more nations with tax
treaties pending which I know the ad-
ministration is continuing to work on
with the Foreign Relations and Fi-
nance Committees to finalize work on
these remaining agreements.
Combined, these seven foreign coun-
tries invest more than $1.2 trillion in
the United States. That is more than $1
trillion in foreign investment and, by
some estimates, hundreds of thousands
of U.S. jobs are tied up, either directly
or indirectly, in trade with these coun-
tries.
These trading relationships touch all
50 States. Every one of my colleagues
is familiar with communities that ben-
efit from the foreign investment. For
my part, that includes thousands of
workers in Kentucky.
One major manufacturer with ties to
Spain employs 1,500 people in my
State. It accounts for more than one
third of all the stainless steel produced
in the United States every year. Over
the three decades it has operated in
Carroll County, the surrounding com-
munities benefited from more than $60
million in tax revenue.
That is just one of many job creators
in my home State, and it is far from
the only one with a serious interest in
seeing these measures get across the
finish line. From consumer goods mak-
ers to industrial suppliers, Kentucky
continues to welcome job-creating in-
vestment from around the world.
I think practically every American is
familiar with Hot Pockets, a culinary
staple of busy families, workers, and
college students everywhere. But not
everyone knows that, as of several
years ago, every single Hot Pocket is
cooked in Mount Sterling, KY. The fa-
cility employs more than 1,000 Ken-
tuckians. The parent company is Nes-
tle, based in Switzerland. So there are
not only hard-working Kentuckians
but also a lot of hungry consumers
across the country who can understand
why we need to keep our international
trade in sync.
Passing these agreements will help
every State to keep up the economic
momentum. It will reinforce the inter-
national trade that is so essential to
our economic success and help stave off
further trade disruptions. I urge all of
our colleagues to join me in voting for
these this week.

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I lis-
tened as the Republican leader came to
the floor and announced the business of
the Senate for this week. Highlighted
in the business will be tax treaties—tax
treaties with Spain, Switzerland,
Japan, and Luxembourg. According to
the Republican leader, these are crit-
ical to economic development in the
United States. I don’t question their
importance, but I will tell you that,
routinely, these are done by voice vote.
We don’t spend the time of the Senate
to come to the floor and talk about our
relationship with Luxembourg.
When you look at the issues that
most American families expect us to
address, I would say the tax treaty
with Luxembourg would be low on the
list. What might be high on the list and
should be considered in the Senate this
week is the No. 1 concern of families
across America—Democrats and Re-
publicans. The highest concern and the
No. 1 issue when asked about the econ-
omy of the United States is the cost of
prescription drugs.
The United States Senate has the au-
thority to do something about the cost
of prescription drugs. We will not be
doing it this week. We will be dealing
with a tax treaty with Luxembourg.
What kind of issues, when it comes to
the cost of prescription drugs, might be
important? Let’s start with one that I
have started focusing on back home.
Did you know that there are 30 mil-
lion Americans who suffer from diabe-
tes, type 1 and type 2 diabetes? Did you
know that 7.5 million Americans use
insulin every single day to stay alive?
Four of them were in my office last
week from Illinois. They were between
the ages of 10 and 17. Talk about amaz-
ing young people. Three young women
and a young boy talked about their
lives and what had happened to them
since it was discovered that they had
juvenile diabetes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4831
July 16, 2019
Their lives have been changed a lot.
Each one of them is hooked up to a
CGM—I believe that is the proper term,
a continuous glucose monitor—that
measures whether they need additional
insulin, which is pumped in another de-
vice on their arm. They talked about
how this was a commitment around the
clock to make sure their insulin levels
were appropriate.
One little girl talked about what it
meant to her family for her to be a
type 1 diabetic. This beautiful young
lady started talking about it. Then she
got to the point where she said: It has
changed our family; my diabetes has
changed our family.
Then she started crying.
She said: We can’t do things in our
family that others do. We can’t take
the same vacations that my cousins
take, and we can’t rent that house out
on the lake because of the cost of my
drugs, the cost of my insulin.
I turned to her mother, and I said:
Tell me, what does it come down to?
Her mom said: We are lucky. We have
health insurance. Our health insurance
covers prescription drugs. However,
there is an $8,000 deductible. So we
start each year buying the insulin for
our daughter until we have spent $8,000
out of our savings. Then the health in-
surance kicks in. Usually it is about 3
months.
She is paying, or she is being
charged, about $3,000 a month for insu-
lin.
Let’s look into this for a minute as
we consider why the U.S. Senate
thinks a tax treaty with Luxembourg
is more important than this issue.
Let’s look into the fact that insulin
was discovered almost 100 years ago in
Canada, and the researchers who dis-
covered it came to the United States
and said: We have the patent rights to
this lifesaving drug for diabetics. We
never want to see anybody make a
profit at the expense of this lifesaving
drug.
The Canadian researchers surren-
dered their patent rights to insulin for
$1—gave it up. I recall that when it
came to the Salk vaccine for polio, he
did the same thing. He said that no one
should ever make a profit on a drug
that eliminated polio. These two Cana-
dian researchers felt the same about
insulin.
What happened then? Insulin was
produced in the earliest stages in a
rather crude way but in an effective
way to save the lives of people with di-
abetes. Over the years, that process
was improved. There is no question
about that.
Today there are three major pharma-
ceutical companies that make insulin
products for the United States—Eli
Lilly of Indianapolis, IN, is one of
them; Novo Nordisk is another; Sanofi
is another. I know a little bit about the
Eli Lilly product. It is called Humalog.
Humalog was introduced in the Amer-
ican market in 1996, an insulin product.
The charge was about $20 to $30 for a
dosage—a vial, I should say, and was
used as a dosage for those with type 1
diabetes, type 2 diabetes. It was about
$21.
Here we are 20 years later, and how
much is that same vial? It is $329. Re-
member, this was a drug discovered al-
most 100 years ago. Remember, those
who could have capitalized and made a
fortune off of it surrendered their pat-
ent rights.
How did we reach the point where
this drug, in 20 years, is 10 times more
than it cost when it was introduced? It
is the same drug from the same com-
pany. Why has it gone up so much in
price? Because they can do it, because
these pharmaceutical companies have
the power to raise their prices, and
people like that little girl in my office
from Jerseyville, IL, who broke down
in tears, can’t control how much that
price would be. They need this to sur-
vive.
Now you must ask yourself: What are
other countries paying for exactly the
same drug made by the same American
pharmaceutical company, Eli Lilly?
We don’t have to go very far to find
out. All we need to go to is Canada—
Canada. The $329 Humalog vial in Can-
ada costs $39. Why? It is exactly the
same drug and is a fraction of the cost
in Canada. It is because the Canadian
Government stands up for the people of
that country and says: You cannot
gouge, you cannot overprice these
drugs. You are going to be paid a rea-
sonable amount so that you make a
profit, but you aren’t going to do it at
the expense of our families in Canada.
They care. They have done some-
thing about it.
We care about a tax treaty with Lux-
embourg. I am sorry, but as important
as that may be in that small part of
the world, it is more important for us
to deal with the issue of prescription
drugs and to ask ourselves why this
U.S. Senate, this empty Chamber, is
not filled with Senators of both polit-
ical parties doing something about the
cost of prescription drugs.
There is one traffic cop in this Cham-
ber. He just spoke. The Republican
leader decides what comes to the floor
of the Senate. He has decided we are
not going to consider prescription
drugs. Maybe he will change his mind,
but I think he will need some per-
suading to reach that point.
What I am hoping is that the 30 mil-
lion Americans and their families will
speak up when it comes to the cost of
lifesaving insulin for diabetes. I hope
they will do the same when it comes to
other drugs—so many of them.
Senator GRASSLEY of Iowa, a Repub-
lican, was just on the floor a few min-
utes ago when we opened the session.
He and I are working on a bill, which is
just a first step—and I underline, only
a first step and not the answer to the
problem. But it comes down to this:
You can’t turn on the television these
days without seeing a drug ad. If you
haven’t seen drug ads on television,
you must not own a television. They
are on all the time. All of the informa-
tion we are given about drugs with
long names that are hard to pronounce
and remember—all of that information
is given to us over and over again so
that we know much more than we ever
dreamed we would know about
XARELTO. We can even spell it. We
know what different drugs are supposed
to do to improve the lives of individ-
uals. Those ads are being thrown at us
so that eventually we have that name
in our head and take it into the doc-
tor’s office and ask for that expensive
drug as opposed to a generic drug. That
is running up the cost of healthcare.
Senator GRASSLEY and I put in a bill,
and the bill is pretty basic. With all of
the things they tell you on television
about the drugs, it wasn’t until just 2
weeks ago—the first time I have ever
seen it—that one of these companies
disclosed the cost of the drug.
You say to yourself, maybe that is an
important part of speaking to con-
sumers across America. Senator
GRASSLEY and I have a bill that will re-
quire price disclosure on these pharma-
ceutical companies’ advertising. It is
not the total answer, but I am hoping
it will in some way at least slow down,
if not embarrass these companies from
the runups in cost that these drugs are
going through.
That is part of the answer, but it is
not the total answer by any means.
There is a long list of things we can do
and should do that are a lot more im-
portant than a tax treaty with Luxem-
bourg, which should pass by a voice
vote without taking the time of the
Senate.
HEALTHCARE
Madam President, thanks to the Af-
fordable Care Act, 20 million Ameri-
cans gained health insurance—includ-
ing more than 1 million in IIlinois.
Thanks to the law, the uninsured rate
in Illinois has been cut in half. People
with preexisting conditions can no
longer be denied health insurance cov-
erage or be charged higher premiums.
This protects 5 million people in Illi-
nois with a preexisting condition. In-
surance companies are no longer al-
lowed to impose annual or lifetime
caps on benefits or deny coverage for
maternity care, mental health treat-
ment, prescription drugs, or hos-
pitalizations. Young people are allowed
to stay on their parents’ health plans
until age 26 and seniors in the dreaded
Medicare donut hole are saving money
on their prescription drugs. Thanks to
the law’s Medicaid expansion, rural
hospitals in Illinois have found a crit-
ical lifeline to help alleviate economic
challenges. Yet, just last week, the
Trump administration and 18 Repub-
lican-led States argued in a Federal
court that the entire law should be
thrown out—ruled unconstitutional. If
President Trump is successful, more
than 600,000 people in Illinois will lose
their health insurance. Nearly 5 mil-
lion Illinoisans with preexisting condi-
tions will, once again, be at risk of dis-
crimination.
Two years ago, President Trump
tried to convince Congress to repeal

the Affordable Care Act. He failed. So
what President Trump couldn’t do with
a Republican-controlled House and
Senate—eliminate health insurance for
20 million Americans—he is now trying
to do through the courts. That is right.
Rather than defending the law of the
land, President Trump’s Department of
Justice is arguing before the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
that the entire law is unconstitutional.
Protections for people with preexisting
conditions? President Trump wants
them struck down as unconstitutional.
A prohibition on insurers imposing an-
nual or lifetime caps on benefits?
President Trump wants that ruled un-
constitutional. Tax credits to help peo-
ple afford health insurance? Unconsti-
tutional, according to our President. If
you thought that the U.S. President
would be on the side of Americans with
preexisting conditions—women in need
of maternity and newborn care, young
adults just out of college, or seniors
with high drug costs—well, you would
be wrong. Instead, President Trump’s
administration is arguing that every
single one of these protections should
be eliminated. If President Trump and
Republicans have their way in court,
insurers will once again be able to dis-
criminate against patients with pre-
existing conditions and impose arbi-
trary caps on benefits, millions will be
thrown off health insurance, and fami-
lies nationwide will pay more.
Earlier this year, the Democratic-
controlled House of Representatives
said: Not on our watch. That is right.
On a bipartisan basis, the House passed
the Protecting Americans with Pre-ex-
isting Conditions Act. This bill would
prevent President Trump from once
again allowing health insurance com-
panies to discriminate against people
with preexisting conditions. The House
didn’t stop there. They also passed a
bill to restore funding to programs
that help people sign up for health in-
surance, and they passed a bill to limit
the sale of junk plans.
Why is the Affordable Care Act so
important? Why are these House-
passed patient protection bills so im-
portant? Why is this court case so im-
portant? They are important because
of people like Nathan from Sleepy Hol-
low, IL, who recently wrote to me
about his brother. Nathan wrote:
My 12-year old brother has Crohn’s Disease
and his treatments are very expensive. . . . I
worry about whether he will be able to still
have insurance if the ACA is over-
turned. . . . Please do everything you can to
help.
To Nathan and his brother, I say this:
The House of Representatives is at-
tempting to help you. Unfortunately,
the Republican-controlled Senate is
not. What is the Senate, under MCCON-
NELL’s watch, doing instead? Nothing.
Rather than address the existential
threat facing America’s health care
system, the Senate HELP Committee
advanced legislation that is stunningly
silent on protections for preexisting
conditions. Republicans are abdicating
their legislative duty to preserve
healthcare in America. As my col-
league, Senator CHRIS MURPHY, said
during the HELP Committee markup,
we are applying a bandaid to one arm,
while the other is being sawed right
off. Republicans on the HELP Com-
mittee announced grand plans to lower
prescription drug costs and shield pa-
tients from surprise medical bills, but
all they really did is tinker around the
edges of the problems. Similarly, the
Senate Judiciary Committee was slat-
ed to tackle the outrageous cost of pre-
scription drugs. Yet what emerged
from committee was the bare min-
imum of legislative action. When will
Congress get serious about going after
drug companies that are gouging the
American public? When will congres-
sional Republicans stop tweeting and
issuing press releases about preexisting
conditions and instead do something—
anything—to help protect people in
need? Talk is cheap, but, unfortu-
nately, it is all congressional Repub-
licans know how to do.
IMMIGRATION
Madam President, I went to Chicago
on Friday. I went to the northwest side
of the city, and I met with a group
called Communities United. It was a
meeting I am not going to soon forget.
There were about 20 people in the
room. Most of them were women with
their children, and a couple of us were
politicians. They talked about the fear
that is running through their commu-
nity with President Trump’s threat of
mass arrests and mass deportations.
Each one of them had an important
thing to say. The one that stuck with
me was a young lady—I will give just
her first name. Guadalupe was her first
name. She is a high school student in
that section of Chicago. She started to
read from a little piece of paper on
which she had written down the feel-
ings of her family about what was hap-
pening with the threats of these raids.
You see, one of her parents is un-
documented. She is a citizen of the
United States, having been born here,
but her mother is not so lucky.
Guadalupe said: I am tired of living
in fear. I am tired of being afraid that
the next knock on the door means our
family will be torn apart; that my
mother, who has been here for almost
20 years, will be forced to leave.
She has never committed a crime.
She has worked hard every single day
for the family, to bring a little money
home, taking jobs that most of us don’t
want to take, being paid low wages in
the hope that her daughter Guadalupe
and others would have a better life in
the years ahead.
I remember that meeting because
that was just the beginning of a week-
end filled with meetings just like those
all across that great city of Chicago,
particularly among the Hispanic popu-
lation—a genuine fear that ICE would
start knocking on doors. People are
being told their rights, their legal
rights, if ICE comes to the door. Most
of them are being told: Don’t open the
door unless there is a real search war-
rant from a real judge, not an ICE ad-
ministrative warrant.
These people, I am sure, will find it
hard to make that distinction, but it
really is a question of whether they
may be able to stay in the United
States or cannot.
Keep in mind that we are not talking
about people who have been convicted
of a serious crime. As far as I am con-
cerned, if you come to this country and
you are undocumented and you commit
a serious crime, you have forfeited
your right to stay here. I am not mak-
ing any defense of those people, but
they are a tiny, small percentage of
those who are here undocumented. The
vast majority came to this country,
some undocumented when they came,
others who have overstayed a visitor’s
visa, a work visa or student visa, and
started a life and started a family.
These are the people who have be-
come a major part of our economy. Of
the 11 million who are undocumented
in this country, 81⁄2 million actually
work. They are employed. They pay
taxes. They are not officially or legally
part of our economy. Yet they are all
subject to the mass arrests and depor-
tation that President Trump has
threatened.
As a Presidential candidate, Donald
Trump regularly used inflammatory
anti-immigrant language. You will re-
member most of these quotes because
they were said over and over again.
Donald Trump said:
The Mexican government is forcing their
most unwanted people into the United
States. They are, in many cases, criminals,
drug dealers, [and] rapists.
Donald Trump said that a Federal
judge was biased against him because
the judge was ‘‘a Mexican.’’ He called
for a ‘‘total and complete shutdown of
Muslims entering the United States.’’
He attacked a family I have come to
know, Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the
Muslim American parents of the Amer-
ican soldier who was killed in the line
of duty. This Gold Star family gave
their son to this country in defense of
it and were ridiculed because they dis-
agreed with President Trump.
For the last 21⁄2 years, President Don-
ald Trump has continued to use divi-
sive language. On January 11, 2018, I
heard it personally. In a meeting in the
Oval Office that I will never forget, the
President used a crude term to refer to
Haiti and African countries.
This weekend, President Trump sunk
to a new low. His tweets saying four
Democratic Congresswomen should ‘‘go
back’’ to their countries were racist
and reprehensible comments. Elected
officials of both parties should con-
demn the President’s statement.
It is important to understand the
President’s hateful language is also re-
flected in his policies. The Trump ad-
ministration has shown unprecedented
cruelty on the issue of immigration, es-
pecially to children and families.
The Muslim travel ban created chaos
at airports across the country and con-
tinues to separate thousands of Amer-
ican families.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4833
July 16, 2019
The cruel repeal of DACA threatens
800,000 young immigrants with deporta-
tion to countries they barely remem-
ber.
The termination of temporary pro-
tected status puts more than 300,000
immigrants at risk of deportation to
dangerous conditions. Imagine this for
a moment. We have a travel advisory
that says to American families: Do
not—do not—go to the country of Ven-
ezuela. It is too dangerous.
But for those Venezuelans who are in
the United States and should qualify
for temporary protected status, this
President has said: We are returning
you to Venezuela.
Really? It is too dangerous for Amer-
icans, but, Venezuelans, we are going
to force you to go back to the horrible
situation in that country.
The disastrous separation of thou-
sands of families at the border has done
permanent damage to these families
and especially to their children. Under
what was known as the zero-tolerance
policy announced by then-Attorney
General Jeff Sessions, over 2,880 in-
fants, toddlers, and children were sepa-
rated from their families at the border.
What was even worse, they were cast
into this bureaucratic no-man’s-land,
and they couldn’t be located to be re-
united with their parents until a Fed-
eral judge demanded it. We still have
some who have not been reunited with
their parents over a year later.
The inhumane overcrowding and mi-
grant detention facilities that the DHS
inspector general found was ‘‘an imme-
diate risk to the health and safety of
detainees and DHS employees’’ was so
bad that after I personally witnessed
it, I joined with more than 20 other
Democratic Senators writing to the
International Red Cross and asking for
them to send in a team to investigate
American detention facilities. I never
thought I would do that.
This President’s threatening, and
now mass arrests and deportations, of
millions of immigrants who have com-
mitted no crime and pose no threat—no
threat—to the security and safety of
this country has created rampant
fears, as I mentioned, in Chicago and
across the Nation.
Now, today, the Trump administra-
tion has put in place a new rule which
will block nearly all asylum claims at
the southern border from nationals of
any country except Mexico, including
families and children fleeing persecu-
tion.
The UNHCR, the refugee Agency for
the United Nations, said this rule pro-
posed by the Trump administration
‘‘will endanger vulnerable people in
need of international protection from
violence or persecution.’’
How did we reach this point? During
World War II, we made a fateful deci-
sion in the United States to turn away
hundreds who were fleeing Europe.
Many of them were people of the Jew-
ish religion who believed the Holo-
caust, which Hitler had initiated,
would eventually reach their families
and take their lives. There were 700 or
800 of them who were on a ship called
the USS St. Louis. They came to the
United States and asked for refuge
here, asylum here, to escape the Nazis.
Sadly, our government turned them
away. They went back to Europe, and
200 died in the Holocaust. After that,
after that horrible experience, we said
we were going to do this differently
from this point forward.
Since World War II, the United
States has led the world in accepting
refugees and asylees. Other countries
have done more than their part. I think
of Jordan immediately. We have tried
to be a leader among developed coun-
tries in accepting refugees and asylees,
and we have done it. When you look at
all of the Cubans who came to the
United States to escape communism
under Castro—we have three Cuban
Americans serving in the U.S. Senate
whose families were part of that exodus
from the island of Cuba. We did the
same thing with Jews who were facing
persecution in the Soviet Union. We
did it, as well, after the Vietnam war,
when those Vietnamese who had stood
by American soldiers and risked their
lives were given refuge to the United
States. The list goes on and on, and it
reflects who we are as a nation. We
screen those who come in, but we say
our doors are open to give them a sec-
ond chance in life and the protection of
the United States.
That was what we did from World
War II until the election of Donald
Trump as President of the United
States. Now he has turned back the
clock. We are back in the USS St. Louis
era, where we are turning away refu-
gees who are simply coming here try-
ing to find some safe place to be.
America is better than this. We can
keep our Nation safe and respect our
heritage as a nation of immigrants. We
can have a secure border and abide by
our international obligations to pro-
tect refugees fleeing from persecution,
as we have done on a bipartisan basis
for decades.
The reality is President Trump’s
cruel and ineffective policies on immi-
gration have made our southern border
much less secure than when he took of-
fice. The President’s obsession with his
almighty border wall to be paid for by
the Mexicans, as he suggested, led to
the longest government shutdown in
the history of the United States—35
days, paralyzing agencies and the gov-
ernment, ironically paralyzing immi-
gration courts that were supposed to
process the people presenting them-
selves at the border. More refugees
have been driven to our border because
the President has shut down legal ave-
nues for migration and blocked all the
systems to stabilize Northern Triangle
countries in El Salvador, Guatemala,
and Honduras.
There is also a gaping leadership vac-
uum at the Trump administration’s
Department of Homeland Security. In
less than 21⁄2 years, there have already
been four different people heading this
Department. Every position at the De-
partment of Homeland Security with
responsibility for immigration or bor-
der security is now held by a tem-
porary appointee, and the White House
has not even submitted nominations to
fill these positions.
The Republicans have tried to blame
Democrats for the President’s failure
to secure the border, but Democrats
have tried to work on a bipartisan
basis to solve this crisis. In February,
after the President finally agreed to
end the longest government shutdown
in history, Congress passed an omnibus
appropriations bill that included $414
million for humanitarian assistance at
the border. When I hear Vice President
PENCE and others saying they were beg-
ging the Democrats to give them
money for the border, we did—$400 mil-
lion in February.
Then, last month, Congress passed an
emergency supplemental appropria-
tions bill with $4.6 billion of additional
funding to alleviate overcrowding at
detention facilities and provide the ba-
sics—food, supplies, and medical care.
Last year, before the border crisis
began, Senate Democrats supported a
bipartisan agreement—bipartisan
agreement—from centrists in both cau-
cuses that included robust security
funding and dozens of provisions to
strengthen border security. We put this
together last year. It was a com-
promise. I didn’t like parts of it, but it
is the nature of the Senate that you
can’t get everything you want; you
have to do the best you can to solve a
problem. We had a bipartisan solution.
This was a chance last year for the
President to step up and accept a bi-
partisan approach. The President re-
jected it. He threatened to veto it. In-
stead, he wanted to push for his
hardline, get-tough immigration re-
form instead. The Senate rejected the
President’s bill, his proposal, with a
strong, bipartisan supermajority. It
was that unpopular and unworkable.
In 2013, 6 years ago, I was part of a
gang of eight Senators—four Demo-
crats and four Republicans—who wrote
comprehensive immigration reform
legislation. It passed the Senate 68 to
32. Unfortunately, the Republicans who
controlled the House of Representa-
tives refused to even consider the bill.
The acting DHS Secretary, Kevin
McAleenan, recently said that if our
2013 bill had been enacted into law,
‘‘We would have a very different situa-
tion. . . . We would be a lot more se-
cure at our border.’’ That is what he
says now about a bill we passed 6 years
ago.
Republican Senator LAMAR ALEX-
ANDER of Tennessee, who supported the
2013 bill, said: ‘‘If that bill became law,
most of the problems we’re having
today we’d not be having.’’ There are
ways to deal with this in a sensible, bi-
partisan way. Our comprehensive bill
did that.
Getting tough, threatening a wall,
and cutting off foreign aid has back-
fired on this President. It has created
failure when it comes to immigration.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4834 July 16, 2019
The Democrats have introduced the
Central American Reform and Enforce-
ment Act as a comprehensive response
to our current border crisis. Let me
tell you the highlights.
It addresses root causes in the North-
ern Triangle countries that drive mi-
grants to flee. It cracks down on traf-
fickers who are exploiting migrants. It
provides for in-country processing of
refugees and expands third-country re-
settlements so migrants can find safe
haven without making that dangerous
and expensive trip to our border. It
eliminates immigration court backlogs
so asylum claims can be processed
quickly. It expands the use of proven
alternatives to detention, like family
case management, so immigrants know
their rights and show up for court.
Democrats stand ready to work on
smart, effective, and humane border se-
curity policies, but we need our Repub-
lican colleagues to condemn President
Trump’s cruel campaign against fami-
lies and children and to work with us
on a bipartisan basis.

TREATIES
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I am
pleased, at long last, to speak on the
floor today in support of four protocols
amending the tax conventions between
the United States and Spain, Switzer-
land, Japan, and Luxembourg.
I have long been a strong supporter
and proponent of these tax protocols
and worked to advance them across
multiple Congresses. In the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, I voted
to advance Japan and Spain protocols
three times and voted four times to ad-
vance the protocols with Luxembourg
and the Swiss Confederation. I am
pleased that, after too many years of
waiting, the majority leader has finally
decided to take up these protocols.
I am a strong believer in the benefits
these treaties provide our country.
They play a critical role in relieving
U.S. citizens and companies of double
taxation, encouraging foreign invest-
ment in the United States, and enforc-
ing U.S. tax law on those who seek to
evade it. There are no downsides to
these treaties.
As I conveyed directly to Secretary
Mnuchin, the Treasury Department’s
initial interaction on these treaties
without consulting the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee was completely inad-
equate. This botched effort resulted in
a completely avoidable delay in taking
up these four protocols. However, I am
pleased that Treasury responded quick-
ly to my concerns, including providing
a written commitment on behalf of the
administration that the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee chair and ranking
member would be consulted on any
changes to the model tax treaty prior
to negotiations based on a new model
or new model provisions. Therefore, I
support moving the tax treaties as ex-
peditiously as possible and urge my
colleagues to support them.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to

MEDICARE
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President,
last month, during National Nurses
Week, Ballad Health, a healthcare sys-
tem in East Tennessee, announced it
would be giving several thousand
nurses a raise.
The head of Ballad Health announced
a $10 million investment in pay in-
creases for nurses.
He said: ‘‘Our nurses and those who
work with them in the provision of di-
rect patient care are heroes . . . how-
ever, it is also true that . . . we face
significant national shortage of these
critical health care providers.’’
Alan, the head of Ballad Health, said
that his investment was, in part, be-
cause of a new rule proposed by the
Trump administration in April.
This new rule will update the for-
mula that determines how much Medi-
care will reimburse hospitals for pa-
tient care. The formula takes into ac-
count, among other things, the cost of
labor in that geographic area called the
area wage index.
This new rule attempts to level the
playing field between hospitals in areas
that have higher wages, and therefore
are reimbursed at a higher rate than
hospitals in areas with lower wages.
The Centers for Medicare and Med-
icaid Services Administrator, Seema
Verma, wrote in a recent op-ed in The
Tennessean in Nashville:
Many stakeholders have raised concerns
that the Medicare hospital payment system
disadvantages many rural hospitals. Our pro-
posed rule brings payments to rural and
other low-wage hospitals closer to their
urban neighbors.
I say this standing in the Senate
Chamber, where we have the chairman
and the ranking Democrat on the Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry Com-
mittee—two experts on rural areas and
rural hospitals in our country.
In recent years, too many rural
Americans have seen their local hos-
pital close and their doctors leave
town.
Since 2010, 107 rural hospitals have
closed across 28 States and another
637—about one-third of all rural hos-
pitals—are at risk of closing.
In Tennessee alone, 12 rural hospitals
have closed since 2010.
A recent survey by the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation and the Harvard
School of Public Health found that one
in four Americans in rural areas
couldn’t access healthcare when they
need it.
This new rule will help rural hos-
pitals keep up with the cost of pro-
viding care and keep those hospitals
open.
Alan from Ballad Health said: ‘‘This
proposed change indicates that Wash-
ington finally understands that rural
health systems, like ours, have been
historically unable to keep up with the
real cost growth of nursing and other
direct care providers.’’
Craig Becker, who leads the Ten-
nessee Hospital Association, wrote in
The Tennessean earlier this month
that this rule ‘‘is good news for our
State’s hospitals and will provide
much-needed relief to many of them,
especially those in rural areas’’ and
that the rule ‘‘finally will address the
significant inequities in the Medicare
area wage index—the first meaningful
effort by any administration to address
this flawed system.’’
This new rule from CMS will help en-
sure Americans can access healthcare
close by to their homes by leveling the
playing field between urban and rural
hospitals that rely on the Medicare
hospital payment system.
Last month, the Senate Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee, which I chair and Senator MUR-
RAY of Washington State is the ranking
Democrat, approved, by a vote of 20 to
3, a bipartisan package of 55 proposals
from 65 Senators to lower healthcare
costs that will help rural Americans.
For example, the legislation would
ban anticompetitive terms that large
hospital chains sometimes use in con-
tracts with employers, such as the so-
called all-or-nothing clauses. These
clauses increase prices for employers
and patients and can block healthcare
plans from choosing hospitals based on
the care quality, the patient experi-
ence, or one hospital’s competitive
pricing.
Banning all-or-nothing clauses will
help level the playing field for smaller,
independent hospitals who are not part
of a large corporate chain.
Another provision in the Lower
Healthcare Cost Act of 2019 will expand
technology-based healthcare to help
Americans in rural areas have access
to specialty care.
I hope the Trump administration and
CMS Administrator Verma will quick-
ly finish this rule and give Americans
better healthcare choices and outcomes
at lower costs, especially in our rural
areas.
I yield the floor.

ator from Michigan.

can speak directly to how important
healthcare services are. My mother was
director of nursing at a small hospital,
and I know, since that time, they have
gone through many changes, barely
holding on to the hospital. We have had

an important way to do that as well.
I thank the chairman for his com-
ments.
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS
Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, people in
Michigan and across the country were
getting ready to celebrate the Fourth
of July.
Families were deciding what to take
on picnics and planning a day on the
water, particularly if you were in
Michigan, on the Great Lakes, and
were finding the very best possible
place to watch the community fire-
works display—and we have many
great fireworks displays.
So what were drug companies doing
to celebrate?
Well, nothing so wholesome, I am
afraid. Instead, they were raising
prices on prescription medications—
prices that are already the highest in
the world.
People in the United States have the
highest prices in the world. Happy
Independence Day.
On July 1 alone, just 1 day, 20 compa-
nies ratcheted up the price of 40 of
their prescription drugs by an average
of more than 13 percent—just in 1 day.
Those companies aren’t alone. Al-
ready this year, prices have gone up for
more than 3,400 different medications.
The average price hike was five times
the rate of inflation.
I know families in Michigan, seniors
in Michigan, would love to have their
incomes, their wages go up five times
the rate of inflation, but that certainly
didn’t happen. It is getting harder and
harder for the average Michigan family
to afford the medications they need to
get and stay healthy, and I know that
is true all across the country. I know
because I hear about it every day.
I know we hear these stories every
day. I hear this from friends and family
and certainly people as I am moving
and traveling throughout Michigan.
Some folks skimp on groceries—it is
still happening today—or put off pay-
ing their electric bill or their gas bill.
Other people take their heart medica-
tion every other day instead of every
day, which, by the way, is dangerous to
do. Still others cut back on insulin,
putting their lives at risk. We had tes-
timony before the Finance Committee
from a mom whose son did that and
lost his life.
Perhaps nobody has been hurt more
than our seniors. Seniors tend to live
on fixed incomes, as we know—pen-
sions and Social Security. They also
tend to have more medications than
younger people, and costs quickly add
up.
In 2017 alone, the average price of
brand-name drugs that seniors often
take rose at four times the rate of in-
flation, according to AARP—four times
the rate of inflation in 1 year—for the
average medication a senior citizen is
using. That is one of the reasons why 72
percent of seniors in a recent poll said
they are very concerned about the cost
of their medications.
It is absolutely shameful that people
in America, one of the richest coun-
tries in the world, are going without
the medicine they need to survive. We
can fix that. This does not have to hap-
pen.
I have always believed healthcare is a
basic human right and that it includes
medicine. Over and over again, I say on
the Senate floor: Healthcare is not po-
litical. For a senior, for a family, for a
child, it is personal. It is personal.
We need to do something about it,
and the No. 1 way we know we can
bring prices down is to let Medicare ne-
gotiate—let Medicare negotiate—for
prescription drugs. Harness the full
power of tens of millions of seniors and
people with disabilities across the
country who are on Medicare to bring
down the prices.
We know negotiation can work be-
cause it works for the VA. We know
that. The VA—Veterans’ Administra-
tion—is allowed to negotiate the price
of prescription drugs and, on average,
saves 40 percent—40 percent—compared
to Medicare.
In fact, if Medicare paid the same
prices as the VA, it could have saved
$14.4 billion on just 50 of the most com-
monly used drugs in 2016 alone—in 1
year, $14.4 billion on just 50 commonly
used medications. This is according,
again, to the AARP.
So what is stopping us?
Well, we have the biggest lobby in
the world called the pharmaceutical
lobby in DC. The fact is, in 2018, there
were 1,451 lobbyists for the pharma-
ceutical and health product industry.
That is almost 15 for every 1 of us as
Senators.
Their job—and they do it extremely
well—is to stop competition and to
keep prices high.
Back in 2003, Medicare Part D was
signed into law. I had worked very hard
as a new Member of the Senate to have
Medicare cover prescription drugs, but
in the end, they blocked Medicare from
harnessing the bargaining power of 43
million American seniors in order to
bring down prices. Unfortunately, our
Republican colleagues supported that.
Sixteen years later, pharmaceutical
companies are still doing everything
they can to put profits before people.
One of those people is Jack, who lives
in Constantine, MI, and was diagnosed
with cancer late last year.
Imagine being told you have cancer
and then being told the drug you need
to treat it is going to cost you $15,000
the first month—$15,000. Jack was
lucky. A generic drug became avail-
able. However, that drug still cost
$3,400 the first month and $400 every
month after that. That is about $8,000 a
year. In Jack’s words, it is an ‘‘extreme
hardship’’—$8,000 a year—trying to fig-
ure out how to be able to have your
cancer medication so you can continue
to live.
Jack added: ‘‘I hope and pray you and
your colleagues on both sides of the
aisle would be able to get something
done.’’
We can get something done, and we
can do it quickly. The best thing is to
let Medicare negotiate and harness the
bargaining power of 43 million people.
There are various proposals that are
good proposals and are being talked
about. We can cap increases, but that
doesn’t cut prescription drug costs
right now. If we are going to seriously
talk about making medicine affordable
and do it the right way—do it the right
way and the way we know that will
work—it is about letting Medicare ne-
gotiate. Let Medicare negotiate.
I think it is time to take Jack’s ad-
vice. We need to work together. We
need to put people above profits. We
need, very simply, rather than moving
the chairs around on the Titanic, to
harness the bargaining power of 43 mil-
lion Americans and get the best price
for them. They deserve it.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRUZ). Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, last
Friday I joined the Vice President of
the United States and a number of our
colleagues on the Senate Judiciary
Committee for a trip to the Rio Grande
Valley and, specifically, to McAllen,
TX.
The Rio Grande Valley Sector,
headquartered in McAllen, is ground
zero for the humanitarian crisis on our
southern border. I know some of our
colleagues refused to acknowledge that
this was indeed a humanitarian crisis
on our border, but that seems to have
waned in recent days in light of the
overwhelming evidence. In fact, in 2014
President Obama himself called it a
humanitarian and security crisis, and
it has gotten nothing but worse.
Of all the sectors, it is head and
shoulders above the rest in terms of ap-
prehensions of people trying to enter
the country illegally. In fact, 46 per-
cent of all apprehensions along the
southern border last month occurred in
the Rio Grande Valley Sector. Across

the entire border, 68 percent of those
apprehended in June were unaccom-
panied children or part of a family
unit. In the Rio Grande Valley, that
figure shot up to a whopping 79 per-
cent.
People may be asking themselves:
Why are unaccompanied children and
families—that is, an adult with a
child—the ones predominantly coming
across the border? It is because human
smugglers know our laws better than
we do, and they are exploiting the vul-
nerabilities in our asylum laws in order
to make a lot of money. They charge
roughly $5,000 to $10,000 per person
whom they deliver across the border
from Central America or from any-
where around the world. As a matter of
fact, the Border Patrol told us on Fri-
day, when we were in McAllen, that
just in the last year they had detained
people from 60—six-zero—different
countries coming across the border at
the Rio Grande Valley Sector. That is
because these human smuggling net-
works are really worldwide. If you
want to come from Bangladesh or
Syria or Iran or Russia, all you have to
do is make your way to Central Amer-
ica, hire one of these human smuggling
networks, and they will work your way
up across the border into the United
States. This is a national security as
well as a humanitarian crisis.
As of July 1, the Rio Grande Valley
Sector had 8,000 migrants in custody.
They are overwhelmed, to be sure. This
is placing a huge strain on our re-
sources. Our Border Patrol stations
were never designed to hold that many
people.
The men and women who apprehend
and care for these migrants have been
unfairly criticized and
mischaracterized as bad guys, but last
week I got to see once again that they
aren’t the real villain in this scenario.
In fact, they are the heroes.
The Border Patrol agents in the Rio
Grande Valley, and those along the en-
tire border, are pulling double duty as
law enforcement officers and care-
givers. They are hired to be law en-
forcement officers, but they have had
to basically end up handing out juice
boxes and diapers to unaccompanied
children or family units because that is
what we are seeing flood across our
borders. One minute they are stopping
fentanyl, heroin, and methamphet-
amine from coming across the border
and they are stopping dangerous crimi-
nals from entering our country, and
the next they are comforting crying
babies and providing sustenance to
children.
Balancing an overcrowded facility
and a constantly growing list of re-
sponsibilities is no easy task, but it is
not their fault. It is Congress’s fault
because only Congress has the author-
ity to provide the change in the laws
necessary to stop this endless flood of
humanity and this overwhelming of
our resources, both human and infra-
structure. These dedicated agents han-
dle these demands with professionalism
and compassion.
My colleagues and I had the oppor-
tunity to hear from several of these
agents, including Chief Patrol Agent
Rudy Karisch. Chief Karisch talked
about the work his agents do to pro-
vide quality care to those in custody,
particularly medical care. In his sector
alone, that equates to an average of 32
hospital runs each day—32 hospital
runs each day—to ensure that migrants
receive the care they need.
As these agents know too well, many
of the people who cross the border do
so because they are deeply familiar
with the loopholes in our immigration
laws, and they are eager to exploit
them, as I described a moment ago.
One of those loopholes is something
called the Flores Settlement Agree-
ment, which was created as a way to
ensure that unaccompanied children
don’t remain in Border Patrol custody
for long periods of time. It was ex-
panded in, I believe, an unintended and
unnecessary sort of way to effectively
expand this protection for unaccom-
panied children to families as well.
As a result, we can’t detain those
families for more than 20 days, the
adults in particular. As a result, we see
the dramatic increase in the number of
families arriving at the border. Why
not? What is to discourage them or dis-
suade them?
As we learned during our visit, many
of these migrants coming across the
border are not families at all. Tim
Tubbs is a deputy special agent in
charge for Immigration and Customs
Enforcement Homeland Security Inves-
tigations, HSI. He discussed the rise in
fraudulent families. In other words, by
that I mean adults claiming to be the
parent or family member of a child
when, in fact, they are not related at
all.
In April, ICE HSI sent more than 400
employees to the southern border to in-
vestigate these fraudulent claims of
family units. In the roughly 90 days
since, more than 352 fraudulent fami-
lies were discovered across the south-
ern border.
He described one case of a Honduran
man that illustrates why leaving these
loopholes untouched is so dangerous.
Again, only Congress can change that.
He mentioned the fact that a 51-year-
old man negotiated with a pregnant
Honduran woman to purchase—to
buy—her baby when it was born. For
the equivalent of about 80 U.S. dollars,
this man purchased her child and then
traveled with human smugglers into
the United States. If you have a child
with you, it is a ticket to entering the
United States and exploiting those
gaps in our immigration laws.
Deputy Agent Tubbs said HSI also
uncovered an organization that recy-
cled—recycled—approximately 69 chil-
dren in order to smuggle people into
the United States. In other words, once
you successfully get to the United
States, these children are sent back
and used over and over again in an end-
less loop to smuggle more adults into
the United States under the guise of
being a family.
We can point the finger of blame at
the Border Patrol for being over-
whelmed for not having facilities that
were designed to handle the influx of
this number of people, but that would
be a terrible miscarriage of justice.
The fact is, Congress needs to look in
the mirror. The only people who can
change the laws under our Constitution
is the U.S. Congress and the President.
The President has called time and
again for Congress to fix these loop-
holes in our immigration laws to begin
to stem the tide of humanity coming
across our border.
Our broken laws are fueling this be-
havior. Unless we take action to close
those loopholes that invite more people
to illegally enter into our country, the
problem will only continue to grow.
Amid calls from many of the so-
called progressive Democrats running
for President to do things that make il-
legally crossing the border legal—in
other words, rather than protecting the
sovereignty of our country, securing
our borders, they want to actually
make entry into the United States
legal—the work being done by our Bor-
der Patrol and our Health and Human
Services and other nongovernmental
organizations at the border to keep our
country safe and care for migrants in
their custody cannot be overstated.
The key to solving this crisis isn’t
opening the door to more illegal immi-
gration; it is removing the pull factors
that encourage people to come here in
the first place. Of course, you can
imagine, if the door were wide open,
how many people would come from
other countries into the United States
at will. They would flood our country.
That is part of what is happening now
because they don’t see any limits or
any order or any rules being applied to
who enters our country.
We are a proud nation of immigrants.
We naturalize almost 1 million people a
year. This isn’t about being anti-immi-
grant. Immigrants have made our
country stronger. Legal immigration is
the key distinction.
Our friends across the aisle seem to
be the champions of illegal immigra-
tion. We want our legal, orderly, law-
ful, rules-based immigration system to
work so it can be fair to everybody,
rather than let people who have been
waiting in line for years to come into
the country legally see people jump in
line ahead of them and enter the coun-
try illegally. That is not fair to them,
and that is not a rules-based and lawful
and orderly system of immigration.
I have introduced legislation that
will take major steps to achieve filling
those gaps, plugging those holes in our
asylum and immigration laws. It is
called the HUMANE Act. This bill
would close the Flores loophole,
streamline the processing of migrants,
improve standards of care, which we all
want to do for individuals in our cus-
tody, and require additional training of
customs and Border Patrol and Immi-
gration and Customs Enforcement em-
ployees who work with children.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4837
July 16, 2019
This bill is, to my knowledge, the
only bipartisan, bicameral solution
that has been offered. It is bicameral.
My friend and colleague in the House,
HENRY CUELLAR, from Laredo, TX, and
I have cosponsored this bill—bipar-
tisan, bicameral.
As we consider this and other legisla-
tive proposals, I hope our colleagues on
the other side of the aisle will finally
get serious about taking the required
action.
Chairman GRAHAM of the Judiciary
Committee tried to organize a bipar-
tisan trip to the border, believing that
would be an important step in helping
us witness together the facts on the
ground and then hopefully work to-
gether to try to solve the problem.
I am disappointed that none of our
Democratic colleagues accepted his in-
vitation. I hope this is not an indica-
tion of what our immigration reform
discussions will look like moving for-
ward: no desire to help, no desire to
solve the problem, no desire to work
together on a bipartisan basis. I hope
that is not where we are, but I am fear-
ful that is exactly where we are.
I appreciate the Vice President tak-
ing the time to visit Texas once again
and getting a chance to see the front-
line challenges our officers and agents
are facing. I would thank Mrs. Pence as
well for accompanying the Vice Presi-
dent.
Despite the challenges this humani-
tarian crisis has brought, the Rio
Grande Valley remains a wonderful re-
gion, characterized by a thriving econ-
omy and a vibrant culture. You would
be hard-pressed to find more generous
people. They have been extraordinarily
generous to the migrants who found
their way to our front doorstep and are
trying to take care of them in a com-
passionate sort of way, but, frankly,
they are overwhelmed too.
I thank the men and women of the
Border Patrol, as well as local officials,
businesses, and members of the border
communities who continue to assist
with this humanitarian crisis. It would
be nice if Congress, on a bipartisan
basis, would lift a finger to help.
ENERGY INNOVATION
Mr. President, on another matter,
this morning, the Energy and Natural
Resources Committee held a hearing to
consider numerous bills introduced to
promote energy innovation in the
United States. Breakneck changes in
technology have fueled our economy,
propelled our communications sector,
and completely transformed each of
our daily lives. Just this alone has
done that. It is time to harness this in-
genuity to revolutionize our energy
sector. Smart policies can’t prioritize
only conservation, productivity, or
economic power. We obviously need to
strike the proper balance. You are not
going to achieve that balance by im-
posing heavy-handed regulations and
driving up costs for consumers.
To put it another way, the Green
New Deal will bankrupt our country
and crush our innovation economy. In-
stead, we have to harness the power of
the private sector and build partner-
ships to create real solutions.
The NET Power plant in La Porte,
TX, is a shining example of how public-
private partnerships can drive next-
generation energy solutions. NET
Power has developed the first-of-its-
kind power system that generates af-
fordable, zero-emissions electricity
from natural gas. Using their unique
carbon capture technology, they have
taken natural gas and made it emis-
sion-free.
This technology is relatively young,
and it is not ready to be scaled up yet
at the national level. By investing in
this type of research, I believe we can
take serious strides to decreasing our
carbon emissions.
While renewable energy sources like
wind, solar, hydropower, and biomass
have come a long way in recent years,
they are not alone sufficient to fuel our
economy. As one witness said, the Sun
doesn’t always shine, and the wind
doesn’t always blow. So you need a
baseload of electricity that has to be
provided by other sources like natural
gas powerplants like the one I saw.
Last year, renewables accounted for
17 percent of our total energy sources.
In Texas, as the Presiding Officer
knows, we produced more electricity
from wind turbines than any other
State in the Nation. Yes, we are an oil
and gas State, but we truly believe in
the all-of-the-above approach. Some
people say that and don’t really mean
it, but we do it every day in Texas.
While renewables account for 17 per-
cent of our total energy sources, nat-
ural gas alone accounts for double
that. Imagine if we could take natural
gas, a plentiful energy source, inexpen-
sive, and bring more projects like NET
Power online. That is precisely why I
introduced the LEADING Act with my
colleagues, Senator COONS, Cassidy,
and Sinema. This bill would incentivize
research and development of carbon
capture technology for natural gas and
support energy innovation.
This legislation was crafted with the
understanding that reliable, affordable,
and environmentally sound energy sup-
plies are not mutually exclusive. You
wouldn’t know that sometimes by the
rhetoric here in Washington.
By incentivizing research into the de-
velopment of new technologies, we can
keep costs low for taxpayers, for sen-
iors, for people on fixed incomes, while
securing our place as a global leader in
energy innovation. The goal of this leg-
islation is to accelerate development
and commercial application of natural
gas carbon capture technologies. We
should do this by requiring the Depart-
ment of Energy to establish a program
to develop cost-effective carbon cap-
ture technologies for natural gas power
facilities.
This legislation would also encourage
partnerships with the National Labora-
tories, as well as universities and other
research facilities to improve and
strengthen our efforts. I am proud the
LEADING Act passed the Energy and
Natural Resources Committee this
morning, and I hope we will have the
opportunity to vote on this and other
similar and related bills before the full
Senate soon.
We need smart energy policies that
will strengthen our economy without
bankrupting American families or
turning the keys over to the central
government to regulate our lives, to
micromanage our lives. We don’t need
the Federal Government to tell us
what to do. We need to follow the pri-
vate sector and innovate our way to
solve these problems, and that is ex-
actly what the LEADING Act would do.
When you implement policies that
get government out of the way and let
the experts do their job, you can be
pro-energy, pro-innovation, pro-
growth, and pro-environment.
I yield the floor.

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF APOLLO 11
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, today I
rise in absolute awe—remain in awe—of
what happened in this country and in
this world 50 years ago this week, and
I am still inspired by the events of our
space program 50 years ago.
Fifty years ago today, Americans of
all ages, in every corner of this great
Nation and, in fact, all over the world,
stopped what they were doing to watch
in complete awe as Apollo 11 launched
from Cape Kennedy, headed toward the
Moon. It is unbelievable what we saw,
what we witnessed, that entire week.
It would be the first time that hu-
mans would set foot on a celestial body
other than the Earth. We would step
foot on the Moon, which had captured
the imagination of the world since
time began, trying to reach that big,
round object in the sky. It was a re-
markable feat, made possible by the
sheer determination and grit of the
American space program and all of
those who participated in it.
I was just a kid growing up in Ala-
bama at the time. I lived just 2 or 3
hours south of what was known as
Rocket City in Huntsville, AL. It is
still known as Rocket City because of
all of the work at NASA and in our
space program today. It was a thriving
metropolis then and even more so
today. That is where all of the rockets
were built. That is where the engines,
the powerful engines that drove the
rockets into space, were built. They
were tested in Huntsville, AL. If you go
there today, most of those stands are
still there. Some of them are about to
be used again. Those Saturn V rockets,
the most powerful rocket engines man
had ever created, were built in Hunts-
ville, AL. They were the engines that
would propel man to the Moon.
I was absolutely mesmerized—abso-
lutely mesmerized—by all things in-
volving the space program. I still am. I
can remember so many times when my
maternal grandfather, Oliver Wesson,
whom I called Paw-Paw, and I would
just sit for hours and watch and listen

to the commentaries. We would watch
the liftoffs. We would watch the splash-
downs. Some of my best memories as a
kid were literally sitting in front of a
TV set with my granddad, watching the
heroes I saw, the heroes I wanted to be,
and the heroes America wrapped their
arms around. At the time, there was
nothing—nothing—and maybe to some
extent today—more that I wanted to do
than to be an astronaut and to go into
space. It sounds corny for an old man
like me to say that, but it is absolutely
true.
Those astronauts, the original Mer-
cury Seven astronauts, were heroes in
every sense of the word. I admire their
courage, not having a clue when they
blasted off from Florida whether they
would return safely. And we did lose
astronauts along the way.
I did so many things. I read. I stud-
ied. I watched. I read papers. A lot of
papers in my grammar, junior high,
and high schools were all written about
the space program.
I am a memorabilia collector, as
many of you may know, including of
autographed baseballs. I have a few
autographed baseballs by some of the
astronauts, but the ones I like most
are the newspapers. From that time, I
could see that everybody could sense
something was special. From the time
Apollo 11 took off from Cape Kennedy,
and the headlines in the Birmingham
News read ‘‘Man Sets Foot in Heav-
ens,’’ to the time they splashed down, I
collected and saved every one of those
newspapers. They are still at home,
and they are prized possessions.
We watched every single launch. We
knew every single name of every astro-
naut. We stood there with intense,
mesmerizing attention to every mo-
ment of those launches.
It was something that captivated
this entire country. It was a unifying
time. It was a unifying force at a time
when America needed it—the 1960s. For
Apollo 11 in 1969, it was a time when we
needed that sense of collective pride.
We needed that sense of unification.
We had gone through tough times dur-
ing the civil rights era. We had gone
through and we were still in the midst
of the Vietnam war and all that tore
this country asunder. We saw all that
happened in 1968. We saw the deaths of
John Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and
Martin Luther King, but the space pro-
gram was that one sense of pride.
It didn’t take a tragedy to unify
America at that time. It took success.
It took a build of what we do. It took
our determination. It took knowing
that we were the most patriotic, and,
doggone, we were going to beat those
Russians to the Moon. It sounds so
corny these days, but it is absolutely
the case. We were going to do it. It was
going to be the United States of Amer-
ica, and, doggone, we did it.
A lot has changed. Today, we are
building on this legacy. We are still
building on this legacy in space. We are
building it in Huntsville, AL, and else-
where with NASA, and we are going to
continue to inspire a new generation—
and more generations to come—of
Alabamans and Americans, people all
across this country, to help us reach
even loftier heights.
Yes, a lot has changed since 1969—50
years ago—but there is a reason that
space flight and exploration of other
worlds continue to capture our atten-
tion and to capture our imagination. It
is because, at the end of the day, we
are all dreamers. We always dream of
those loftier heights. We always want
to achieve. We always want to make
this country great—consistently make
this country great. We always want to
reach for the stars, whether it is in our
personal lives or whether it is collec-
tively as a country. That is what we
do. We are dreamers.
Today, 50 years after the launch of
Apollo—and on Saturday, we will cele-
brate 50 years of the actual steps on
the lunar surface—we celebrate the
achievement of a dream five decades
ago, but a dream that started long,
long before that, long before President
Kennedy challenged America to put a
man on the Moon.
Looking back, 50 years ago was real-
ly just the beginning. It showed us that
a true moonshot was possible, and,
quite literally, it opened our world to
new possibilities.
Today, we are reaching for human
spaceflight back to the Moon and to
Mars. It is not just us; other countries
are doing the same. We are looking for
a return flight to the Moon for deeper
exploration. We are receiving pictures
from the farthest reaches of the gal-
axy, things we have never seen before.
We have seen the surface. We have
landed rovers on the Moon surface and
have seen the pictures and have done
the tests. It is just unbelievable. Who
would have ever thought of this some
50, 60 years ago when I was a kid?
Today, we have a greater under-
standing of the universe around us and
how we apply that knowledge to our
own lives. We continue to reach for the
stars.
Yes, a lot has changed, but a lot
hasn’t. We still have divisions in this
country. We still need that unifying
voice. We still need that sense of pride
that we can all—everybody—wrap our
arms around.
Today, we seem to be divided more
than we were during the height of the
Vietnam war. We seem to be divided
over the very issues that my friend
Senator CORNYN was talking about a
moment ago with regard to immigra-
tion. We are divided over politics—a
partisan divide. We are divided over
gun violence. You name it; we are di-
vided. So we need that unifying voice.
We need something positive that we
can all wrap our arms around.
It is not just a holiday—and some-
times now, in today’s world, unfortu-
nately, even our holidays get divided.
Even on our holidays, people go to
their corners for political reasons, on
both sides of the aisle. Make no mis-
take, folks, I am not casting a stone
one way or another. I am casting it
across this land. People are divided.
We have to honor the visionaries of
long ago, as well as the visionaries of
today who think big, dream big, and
give our Nation a collective sense of
purpose and unity—a collective sense
of unity and purpose—not a divisive
sense of purpose for their own benefit
but a collective sense of unity and pur-
pose.
We can honor those folks by setting
aside all of the differences we see. We
can honor those folks by not going to
our corners every time a hot-button
issue is mentioned either here on the
floor of the Senate or in a tweet or in
a Facebook post or in the national
news. We can set that aside. We can set
it aside by setting aside our dif-
ferences.
We honor folks by setting aside our
differences today. We can honor those
folks by remembering our collective
pride and who we are as Americans, by
making sure that all men and women
are created equal and living up to the
creed that we so proudly point to in
the Declaration of Independence and
the Constitution. We can do that again.
We can honor these visionaries by com-
ing together, reaching across the aisle
and also reaching within our aisles to
bring people together to talk about
those things we can do together and
with a sense of pride. We can do it by,
once again, being the leader of the
world and not trying to do everything
alone but bringing our friends and al-
lies to join us in these collective ef-
forts to make us stronger.
Yes, we owe those folks a great debt
of gratitude for making America a
leader in space, a leader in the world,
and giving us all something to dream
about. Let us now meet that challenge
in a different way.
Let us continue to explore space. Let
us continue to reach for the stars, but
let us dedicate ourselves to becoming
that unified voice so that something
we can all dream about is one Amer-
ica—one America—not a house divided
but one America for everyone.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.

EB–5 REGULATIONS
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I
come to talk to my colleagues today
about the deeply flawed EB–5 green
card program.
Several weeks ago, we learned that
the Office of Management and Budget
at the White House had completed its
review of the new rules to update and
reform the EB–5 Program. I have been
an advocate for reforming this program
for a long, long period of time. Several
times I have even talked to the White

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4839
July 16, 2019
House about moving these regulations
along.
Now that they have been reviewed by
OMB, for the rule to come into effect,
it must now be published in the Fed-
eral Register. The rule was first pro-
posed in January 2017. We have been
waiting for it to be finished for 21⁄2
years. I hope that President Trump
now makes that happen as soon as pos-
sible.
The proposed rule would raise the
minimum investment amounts re-
quired under the program. It also
makes sure that investments are di-
rected to rural areas and truly high-un-
employment areas, as Congress in-
tended when EB–5 was created in 1990.
Considering those points of where
EB–5 ought to be concentrated and now
looking at how they have been diverted
from the original intent of Congress is
the very best reason for these rules to
be put in place—to get us back to
square one, the original intent of the
law.
Since the 1990s, rampant and abusive
gerrymandering of the EB–5 Program’s
targeted employment areas has under-
mined that congressional intent, which
was to direct it toward high-unemploy-
ment areas and rural areas. Instead of
channeling investment to rural and
high-unemployment areas, EB–5 has
become a source of cheap foreign cap-
ital for big-city, big-moneyed interests.
The targeted employment area reforms
in the proposed rule would take a first
step toward refocusing EB–5 invest-
ment in the way that Congress origi-
nally intended in that 1990s legislation.
In addition to channeling investment
away from the areas of our country
that need it the most, this is what has
happened. The EB–5 Program has been
plagued with other forms of fraud and
abuse, and this has been going on for
years and years. There are examples of
EB–5 fraud from all over the country,
and I am going to give just a few exam-
ples as a reminder to the President
why these rules need to be put into the
Federal Registry right away.
In Chicago, a businessman defrauded
290 investors of $150 million in funds
that were supposed to be used for con-
struction of a hotel and conference cen-
ter near O’Hare Airport.
In Palm Beach, FL, a real estate de-
veloper and real estate attorney
teamed up to defraud 60 Chinese and
Iranian EB–5 investors of $50 million.
Instead of that money being used to
fund the construction of a proposed
hotel, it was instead used to pay per-
sonal taxes and purchase a 151-foot
yacht.
In Wisconsin, a businessman used
over half of the $7.6 million in funds he
had solicited from investors to pay for
personal expenses, including Green Bay
Packers tickets and the purchase of a
Cadillac Escalade.
I could go on all day.
In May of 2017, U.S. Citizenship and
Immigration Services conducted an in-
ternal fraud assessment and found 19
cases of national security concerns
within the EB–5 Program. Those are
national security concerns. The No. 1
responsibility of the Federal Govern-
ment is to protect the American peo-
ple, and that involves national secu-
rity. These cases related to terrorism,
espionage, and information and tech-
nology transfer.
Unfortunately, multiple bipartisan
efforts in the Congress to modify the
EB–5 Program have been consistently
stymied by powerful special interest
groups and big-moneyed interests. Be-
cause I have been in the middle of
those battles—and they are bipartisan
battles—over the years, I know exactly
where these big-moneyed interests are
coming from and the special interest
groups that keep this program from
being reformed.
Now we have an opportunity for one
person—the President of the United
States—through regulation, to reform
this program in a way that would be
very helpful. So that makes the publi-
cation of the EB–5 reform rules even
more important. I applaud President
Trump and the administration for get-
ting the proposed rule to this point,
but now it is time for the President
and his team to finish the process and
make sure the final rule goes into ef-
fect as soon as possible.
Iowans and all Americans who live in
rural and high-unemployment areas de-
serve to have the investment that Con-
gress intended when the EB–5 Program
was created almost 30 years ago. Presi-
dent Trump and his administration
now have a chance to finally address
some of the very serious flaws in this
program that have hurt rural America.
We have been waiting for these reforms
for over 2 years. It is time for this final
rule to be published, and it needs to
happen right now, if not sooner.
TREATIES
Mr. President, I rise today for the
purpose of expressing my support for
the passage of the resolutions of advice
and consent that the Senate is consid-
ering this week with respect to the pro-
tocols to our tax treaties with Spain,
Switzerland, Japan, and Luxembourg.
Tax treaties are a very integral part
of the architecture of our tax system.
For example, these treaties would help
define the rules of the road for cross-
border investment and trade for U.S.
individuals and companies doing busi-
ness in one of our treaty partner coun-
tries, like Spain, as an example, and
for individuals and companies in those
countries doing business in the United
States.
The protocols before us today provide
important updates to the tax treaties
with these four countries. In general,
several of them lower withholding
taxes and include provisions to prevent
double taxation. Several provide mech-
anisms for resolving disputes in a time-
ly manner through mandatory binding
arbitration. In addition, they provide
important updates to the exchange of
information provisions in the under-
lying treaties.
I am aware of the concerns that have
been raised regarding the standard
used to provide for such exchange of in-
formation. The standard provided for
in these protocols is that relevant in-
formation shall be exchanged between
the United States and its treaty part-
ners. That relevant standard has been
used throughout our treaty network
for decades and is also the standard
used in U.S. domestic tax laws.
This issue was raised last month in
the Foreign Relations Committee, and
an amendment was offered to the reso-
lution regarding the protocol with
Spain that would have required a nar-
rower standard. That amendment was
appropriately defeated. If the issue is
raised again as an amendment here on
the floor, I will urge my colleagues to
vote no on the amendment.
These four protocols have been
awaiting action by the Senate for
many years. In some cases, it has been
nearly a decade. It is important that
the Senate fulfill its constitutional
duty to provide its advice and consent
on tax treaties and protocols. It is also
important that our treaty partners
know that the United States really val-
ues these agreements and negotiates
these treaties and protocols in good
faith, with the expectation that they
will be implemented without lengthy
delays.
Our actions on these protocols are
also timely, given the international ef-
fort to address the effects of digitaliza-
tion on the international tax system.
For the past several months, rep-
resentatives from the Treasury Depart-
ment have been actively engaged in ne-
gotiations at the Organisation for Eco-
nomic Co-operation and Development.
These talks are focused on finding a
multilateral agreement to these issues
and avoiding the regrettable unilateral
approach that some countries have
taken—most notably, France. Ulti-
mately, if these negotiations are suc-
cessful, there could be a need for the
United States to update its bilateral
income tax treaties.
It is important that the Senate take
action on the pending protocols and
send a strong signal to our treaty part-
ners that the international tax agree-
ments are a priority for our country.
In addition to moving forward on
these four protocols, we have three new
income tax treaties with Chile, Hun-
gary, and Poland that are awaiting ac-
tion by the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee. I urge Chairman RISCH and
Ranking Member MENENDEZ to use the
wave of momentum that is building
this week to move forward on those
three new treaties and send them to
the floor of the Senate as soon as pos-
sible.
I thank the chairman and ranking
member for moving these protocols to
the floor. These treaties were reported
favorably by the committee by voice
vote without amendment, and their
consideration is long overdue.
I thank Leader MCCONNELL and Mi-
nority Leader SCHUMER for their efforts
to bring these protocols up for consid-
eration on the floor this week.

UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA TRADE
AGREEMENT
Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I
rise today to speak about a very impor-
tant issue not only for my home State
but for our country, and that is the
United States-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment, also referred to as the USMCA.
This is the agreement that would re-
place NAFTA. It will increase exports,
expand consumer choice, raise wages,
and boost innovation not just for our
country but also for two of our strong-
est trading partners, Canada and Mex-
ico, as well.
In the United States the U.S. Inter-
national Trade Commission’s analysis
found that the USMCA will raise GDP
by nearly $63 billion and create more
than 176,000 jobs. The implementation
of this agreement will also benefit my
State, as it will secure and expand
market access for our ag producers,
and that is true for all of our ag-pro-
ducing States across the country. It
will help to grow our manufacturing
base, as well, for our manufacturing
States, such as Ohio. I see that my
good friend and colleague from Ohio
has just joined us. It will provide im-
portant support and help for the tech-
nology sector and energy sector. All of
our different industry sectors stand to
benefit from this agreement.
Access to foreign markets is critical
for American agriculture and for our
producers, who have maintained an ag
trade surplus for more than 50 years.
We produce far more than we can con-
sume in this country, and we need ac-
cess to markets in Canada, Mexico, and
beyond.
My State of North Dakota is the
ninth largest producer of ag goods, ex-
porting and shipping $4.5 billion worth
of ag products around the globe, for ex-
ample, in 2017.
Farmers and ranchers depend on free
and fair trade to sell the highest qual-
ity, lowest cost food supply, not just in
our country but in the world. We
produce the highest quality, lowest
cost food supply. That benefits every
single American every single day, and
it benefits many other people around
the globe if we are able to export to
these other countries.
According to the International Trade
Commission report, the USMCA will
increase U.S. ag and food exports to
Canada and Mexico by $2.2 billion. This
agreement secures existing market ac-
cess, makes ag trade fairer, increases
access to the Canadian market, and
supports innovation in agriculture,
which is why it is critical that Con-
gress consider and pass this agreement
as soon as possible.
Passage of the USMCA will help to
secure market access in Canada to U.S.
farmers and ranchers as the agreement
maintains all existing zero-tariff provi-
sions on ag products. Canada and Mex-
ico are crucial markets for U.S. agri-
culture and the USMCA gives the cer-
tainty that these markets will con-
tinue to remain open for business.
I have more, but some of my col-
leagues are here. So I will turn to
them, starting with my colleague from
Indiana, somebody who has been active
in business for many years. He built a
business from scratch, from nothing to,
I believe, more than 1,000 employees.
He is certainly somebody who under-
stands the importance of business and
understands the importance of markets
and access to those markets, and trade
and export. So I turn at this point to
the good Senator from Indiana for
some of his thoughts on this important
issue.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana.
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, it is
true. I am a mainstream entrepreneur,
and I have been involved with business
my entire life, including the farm mar-
kets. I started a turkey farm back in
1979 from scratch, and I was involved in
it for 32 years. I sold my share of it to
my partner’s kids and grandkids. My
wife has had a business in downtown
Jasper, my hometown, for years.
I have been an entrepreneur. I have
dealt with how hard the marketplace is
even when things are going well.
I stand to make the point on behalf
of Hoosier farmers and businesses and
to express my strong opinion that we
need to get the USMCA across the fin-
ish line.
This agreement is vital to secure our
hard-fought market access for Amer-
ican agriculture. At a time when agri-
culture could never have more chal-
lenges, from chronically low prices to
the increasing concentration among
farmer-suppliers with big corporations,
this is one piece of uncertainty we need
to eliminate.
In stressing the importance of the
USMCA, I would state that despite the
fact NAFTA had its faults, it was quite
successful in securing markets for
farmers. The USMCA is better. It pro-
vides stronger access to Canadian mar-
kets for U.S. milk, wheat, poultry, and
egg products. It ensures that Hoosier
wine and spirit makers are treated fair-
ly on Canadian shelves. And it secures
the Mexican market for Indiana pork,
cheese, and grain.
The USMCA improves on NAFTA in
other areas of the economy as well. It
adds modern rules for digital trade and
stronger protections for American in-
tellectual property. We know how im-
portant that is with regard to dealing
with the Chinese.
It contains new rules of origin that
ensure more manufacturing is con-
ducted in North America and has
brand-new rules to bring more of that
production back to the United States.
When President Trump ran for office,
he ran on a few simple things, and ne-
gotiating a NAFTA improvement was
one of his core promises to the Amer-
ican public. At the time, Congress had
two requests: Follow the guidelines
from the trade promotion authority
and move quickly—move quickly—to
minimize uncertainty. President
Trump upheld his end of the bargain.
He has delivered an agreement that is
better than the original NAFTA in
nearly every respect.
This week Congress is ready to vote,
and yet we can’t. Why? Because House
Democrats will not bring it to the
floor. Don’t believe me? Look at this
letter, dated July 8, from several House
Democrats.
They say in plain English: Do not
send this agreement to the Congress.
Do not send this agreement to the Con-
gress.
Madam President, I ask unanimous
consent to have printed in the RECORD
a letter dated July 8, 2019, to Robert
Lighthizer.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Washington, DC, July 8, 2019.
Hon. ROBERT LIGHTHIZER,
Office of the U.S. Trade Representative,
Washington, DC.
DEAR AMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER: We appre-
ciate all the work you have done with the
New Democrat Coalition and the rest of the
Democratic caucus to resolve the out-
standing issues that must be addressed for a
successful, bipartisan passage of the updated
North America Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA).
These conversations have been frank, pro-
ductive and engaged in in good faith by all
parties, and we are therefore optimistic that
these limited concerns can be addressed in a
timely manner. While we appreciate your
willingness to listen, we have not seen any
meaningful progress or tangible proposals
from you to address these concerns. It has
been clear from the outset that such pro-
posals are necessary for a successful resolu-
tion.
The New Democrat Coalition was integral
in the development and passage of the Bipar-
tisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Ac-
countability Act of 2015 (TPA). It is our be-
lief, as legislators intimately involved with
the law under which the new NAFTA was ne-
gotiated, that moving forward with imple-
menting legislation absent the agreement of
Democratic leadership would almost cer-
tainly be taken as a failure to fulfill the con-
sultation requirements of TPA. We were
troubled that you sent up the draft State-
ment of Administrative Action on May 30

Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, this
is an outrage. We are ready to pass the
USMCA. Today you will hear from Sen-
ators who support this deal. In the Sen-
ate we have more than enough votes to
pass the USMCA. There is no reason to
wait.
The Democrats have known the con-
tents of this deal for over 2 years. They
knew the provisions offered by the
United States and saw the text as it de-
veloped. Once the final text was re-
leased, the Democrats were stunned.
They couldn’t figure out how to oppose
the USMCA.
First, they argued that Mexico need-
ed to pass its labor reforms. Mexico did
so in April. Then, they moved the goal-
post, arguing that labor and environ-
mental provisions in the deal were not
strong enough, even though the provi-
sions in USMCA are substantially
stronger than those in the NAFTA, an
agreement that some of them sup-
ported.
They still want to move the goalpost.
In fact, the USMCA is the first-ever
trade agreement to contain provisions
requiring a minimum wage for Mexican
auto workers. The Democrats still
aren’t happy. This time they are ask-
ing for enforcement. In response, the
Mexican President issued assurances
that Mexico would enforce the new
labor law Democrats had demanded.
But NANCY PELOSI is keeping those
goalposts moving. The fact of the mat-
ter is that the Democrats are blocking
USMCA because they do not want to
give President Trump a win—the worst
of all reasons and what makes this
place so objectionable to so many peo-
ple.
In the meantime, NAFTA remains
the law of the land. While they play
their political games American work-
ers are still competing under the old
NAFTA rules. It is time for NANCY
PELOSI to end these political games.
We need to pass the USMCA.
In closing, I simply would remind my
colleagues that this trade debate is un-
like any other this Chamber has ever
made. The USMCA is the first-ever re-
negotiation of a major trade agree-
ment. We are not talking about wheth-
er we should have an agreement with
our Mexican and Canadian partners,
because we already do. Instead this de-
bate is about the future of that rela-
tionship. Do the American people want
the rules in the original NAFTA or do
they want the modern protections in-
cluded in the USMCA?
The USMCA is a substantially better
agreement than NAFTA, and the
American economy—Hoosiers—need
these new rules so that we can move
forward into the 21st century with a
stronger American economy in the
North American region. It is time to
pass the USMCA now.
I yield my time.
Mr. HOEVEN. I would like to thank
the Senator from Indiana. Like our
State, it is a major ag State. It also
has manufacturing and many other
areas. The USMCA is very important
to the State of Indiana. I thank the
good Senator for his comments today.
I turn to the senior Senator from
Iowa—another State that certainly has
a big part in ag—and ask for his com-
ments on the importance of the
USMCA.
Mr. GRASSLEY. First of all, I thank
Senator HOEVEN for leading this discus-
sion. It is a very important discussion
because American farmers, workers,
and businesses stand to benefit greatly
from the new United States-Mexico-
Canada Agreement.
This successor agreement to NAFTA
will allow for more market access for
agriculture, new commitments in crit-
ical areas such as customs, digital
trade, intellectual property, labor, en-
vironment, currency, and the lowering
of nontariff barriers—all translating
into higher wages, greater produc-
tivity, and more jobs.
As a family farmer, I can say without
a doubt that trade with Canada and
Mexico is critical to the prosperity of
my State of Iowa, the Midwest, and, for
that matter, all of rural America. In
2019, a Business Roundtable study
found that trade with Mexico and Can-
ada supported 12 million U.S. jobs. The
same study found that 130,000 Iowa jobs
were supported by trade with Canada
and Mexico in 2017, and $6.6 billion in
Iowa goods and services were exported
to Canada and Mexico. According to
the National Association of Manufac-
turers, Canada and Mexico purchase
nearly half of Iowa’s total global man-
ufacturing exports.
President Trump and Ambassador
Lighthizer delivered a solid deal to en-
hance this critical relationship with
our good neighbors. Now, Congress
must act to implement the U.S.-Mex-
ico-Canada Agreement. As Ambassador
Lighthizer said earlier this year, doing
so will not only help the economy of
the three countries, but it will enhance
the credibility of America’s global
trade agenda. That is more important
than ever, as talks between the United
States and China are back on track.
I am looking forward to hearing con-
crete suggestions from House Demo-
crats sometime soon. I am glad Speak-
er PELOSI has formed working groups
to work with Ambassador Lighthizer to
address Democrats’ concerns and that
these meetings are underway.
About a month ago, I met for a half
hour with Speaker PELOSI, and I can
assure you that she wants to get to
‘‘yes,’’ but she has a lot of new Mem-
bers. The House of Representatives has
the largest number of new Members in
that body since 1974, and there is a lot
that new Members have to learn. As
Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives, she has to make sure those new
Members are comfortable with it. I am
sure she wants to get there.
Any additions to the USMCA that
might come as a result of these nego-
tiations that can improve the outcome
of American workers, I am happy to
consider.
It is important to remember that
USMCA is better than NAFTA by near-
ly every standard, including labor and
environment. I hope discussions be-
tween House Democrats and Ambas-
sador Lighthizer are an exercise in get-
ting to the ‘‘yes’’ that I feel Speaker
PELOSI wants to get to.
One particular area where everyone
can agree is that enforcement across
the board is a key compromise that
must be hammered out. Factors out-
side of farmers’ hands, such as an over-
supply of grain in the global market,
an unusually wet spring across the
Midwest, and natural disasters, like
flooding, have all contributed to in-
creased uncertainty and less profit-
ability for farmers, leading to anxiety
among those same farmers. Passing the
USMCA will help alleviate some of
that uncertainty and anxiety for the
years ahead by providing a stable ex-
port market for American corn, soy-
beans, pork, and dairy, to name just a
few examples of the benefits not only
to farming but the rest of the agenda
for manufacturing and services.
I yield the floor.
Mr. HOEVEN. I would like to thank
the Senator from Iowa not only for his
work on agriculture but also his lead-
ership on the Finance Committee,
which is so important to advancing
USMCA.
We will now go from the Midwest to
the South. This is an agreement that
benefits all regions of the country. I
now turn to the good Senator from the
great State of Arkansas.
Mr. BOOZMAN. I want to thank my
colleague Senator HOEVEN for orga-
nizing this very important event.
I think you sense a theme building
here. Many of my colleagues have spo-
ken about the economic benefits
USMCA holds for their specific States,
and I would like to add Arkansas to the
list.
According to the Arkansas World
Trade Center—which, by the way, does
an excellent job promoting trade in my
State and growing opportunities for
our exporters—Canada and Mexico are
Arkansas’s top trading partners by far.
Arkansas goods and services are ex-
ported to 181 countries, but Canada and

Mexico combined for over one-third of
our exports in 2017. Our exports to
these two countries added $2.1 billion
to Arkansas’s economy that year.
Nearly 69,000 jobs in my State are de-
pendent on trade with Canada, and an-
other 41,000 jobs are affected by trade
with Mexico. Arkansas exports about
$1.3 billion in goods to Canada and an-
other $182 million in services. I could
go on, but we have already covered a
lot of statistics here today.
It is important to remember that
there are real people behind this data.
They are the workers in the paper
mills in South Arkansas, the employ-
ees of the steel mills in Northwest Ar-
kansas, the family farmers producing
rice in the delta, and the line workers
at the poultry-processing plants in
Northwest Arkansas.
These Arkansans, and many more,
work in the industries that produce our
top exports to Mexico and Canada. For
them and countless others, the an-
nouncement that a trade agreement
has been reached with Canada and Mex-
ico was very welcome and promising
news. Arkansas farmers, business lead-
ers, and workers understand how vital
it is to have free but also fair trade,
particularly with our neighbors to the
north and the south. It helps create the
sense of certainty that has been sorely
missing for our manufacturers, small
businesses, and the agriculture indus-
try.
For our agricultural community, it is
particularly crucial that we push this
agreement across the finish line. Our
farmers face a very tenuous situation
right now. Commodity prices are well
below the cost of production. Farm in-
comes in 2018 dropped sharply again for
the fifth consecutive year. Total farm
debt has risen to levels not seen since
the early 1980s. A rainy fall and spring
have hampered planting season and, in
the case of Arkansas, produced one of
the worst floods in the State’s history.
All this combined has placed Arkan-
sas’s rural communities in dire condi-
tions. Far too many family farms are
barely hanging on, and, sadly, many
more are filing for bankruptcy.
Arkansas has a diverse economy,
ranging from aerospace and defense to
steel production, to the world’s largest
retailer, but agriculture is by far our
largest industry. It adds around $16 bil-
lion to our economy every year and ac-
counts for approximately one in every
six jobs in Arkansas.
In my discussions with farmers on
how we can help, the same mantra is
often repeated: They prefer trade over
aid. While they appreciate the Presi-
dent’s efforts to ease the pain during
these trade standoffs, what they really
need are more markets in which to sell
their products. They understand that
increased trade is the way forward to
create a better long-term outlook for
their operations.
Our neighbors to the north and south
are our natural allies and trading part-
ners. The President’s team worked
hard to get Canada and Mexico to the
negotiating table to formalize a more
mutually beneficial agreement. That
hard work has paid off in the form of
the USMCA. Now Congress has the re-
sponsibility to see it through to the
end.
Fair trade agreements have become
increasingly important to Arkansas’s
economy over the last half-century. As
the world becomes more inter-
connected, access to global markets is
necessary not just for the large cor-
porations that call Arkansas home but
also for small and medium-sized busi-
nesses that are looking to expand their
operations and their footprints. With a
level playing field, Arkansas’s agri-
culture, manufacturing, and small
businesses can compete with anyone
around the globe. Let’s help them take
a giant step closer to that by swiftly
approving USMCA.
Mr. HOEVEN. I would like to thank
the Senator from Arkansas for his
words and also his leadership in agri-
culture.
Now I turn to the Senator from Ohio,
who I think is going to touch on some
of the aspects that are beneficial for
the manufacturing sector.
The Senator from Ohio.
Mr. PORTMAN. Thank you to my
colleague from North Dakota. North
Dakota has a lot of farmers and manu-
facturers. There is a lot of manufac-
turing in his State as well, and they
never had a better friend. That is why
he is so strong a supporter of this
agreement. It makes a big difference.
My colleague from Arkansas talked
about the fact that Arkansas’s two
largest trading partners are Canada
and Mexico. It is the same for Ohio.
China is actually kind of a distant
third. These two countries are critical
for our exports. That is why this agree-
ment is so important.
I am a former trade lawyer. I also
was the U.S. Trade Representative
under George W. Bush. Now I am on the
Finance Committee, which is the com-
mittee that handles these trade issues.
I think having a balanced and healthy
trade relationship is very important.
We have to stand up for our country.
We need to enforce these agreements
we have. We also need to expand the
exports because that is what creates
jobs—by the way, better paying jobs.
They pay about 16 percent more on av-
erage and have better benefits. That is
why we need to be sure we have agree-
ments like this one.
We have about 5 percent of the
world’s population and about 25 per-
cent of the world’s economy. We need
to sell our stuff overseas. It gives us
access to 95 percent of the consumers
who live outside of our borders. Mexico
and Canada, as I said, are our biggest
trading partners. Thirty-nine percent
of our exports go to Canada alone—
twice the national average. All in all,
Mexico and Canada now support more
than 12 million jobs nationally, accord-
ing to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
We all know the NAFTA agreement
has to be updated. It is now 25 years
old, and it looks like it. It doesn’t have
a lot of things I would expect in any
modern agreement, such as taking care
of the digital economy. So much of our
economy is now over the internet; yet
there is nothing in this agreement that
deals with that part of our economy.
It is more than just a name change.
It does include a lot of different as-
pects. We put in more modern agree-
ments that we don’t have in the
NAFTA.
Another is labor and environmental
standards. Not only are they stronger,
but they are enforceable under this
new agreement. They are not enforce-
able under NAFTA.
Auto jobs have left the United States
of America over the last 25 years. One
reason this agreement is necessary is
that the USMCA shifts more auto pro-
duction back to the United States. My
colleague from North Dakota talked
about the manufacturing side. This is
going to get U.S. automobile assembly
lines humming again because if you
want to get the better tariff treatment
under the USMCA, car parts and cars
have to have higher content from
North America—that means from us.
Under NAFTA, that requirement was
62.5 percent, and under USMCA, it is 75
percent. There is also a new provision
where 70 percent of steel that is used in
automobiles has to be North American
steel. Both of these things help to en-
sure that we have more manufacturing
jobs in Ohio and around the country.
American farmers, as we have heard
earlier, are going to gain access to new
markets in Canada and Mexico. That is
why Ohio farm groups are for this.
That is why, by the way, nearly 1,000
farm groups from around the country
now—I didn’t know there were 1,000
farm groups—have come out to support
this agreement.
Small businesses in Ohio and around
the country whose bottom line relies
on these internet sales, internet com-
merce is going to have much more ac-
cess to Canada and Mexico, thanks to
these new digital economy provisions.
So it kind of helps across the board.
By the way, these stronger labor
standards in Mexico we talked about
are going to help level the playing field
in terms of labor because labor costs
are less in Mexico, but it goes even fur-
ther than that. It actually requires
that 40 to 45 percent of a USMCA vehi-
cle made in Mexico, or anywhere in
North America, must be produced by
workers making at least 16 bucks an
hour.
This is kind of revolutionary. It is a
different kind of thinking in a trade
agreement. Frankly, it is something
you would expect from a Democratic
administration to put into an agree-
ment, but it is in there, and it is going
to help autoworkers in this country.
Because of all of these changes I have
discussed—by the way, many of which,
like the higher minimum wage or like
the higher domestic content, have been
advocated by Democrats in the past.
That has been their approach to these

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4843

trade agreements, not Republicans so
much, but because these provisions are
so good for workers, I must tell you I
am surprised—even amazed—to see so
many of my Democratic colleagues not
stand up to support this agreement be-
cause it has all of these things they
have said they have wanted over the
years, and they certainly don’t like
NAFTA. Many of them have cam-
paigned against NAFTA for the past 25
years. In a way, if you vote against
USMCA, you know what you are stuck
with—NAFTA. So in a way, you are
voting for NAFTA if you vote against
USMCA.
That is the alternative here. It is a
binary choice, as they say. It is either
you are for this new agreement that is
an improvement or you go back to the
status quo, which is NAFTA.
So it will be interesting to see, but
my hope is the media and others, out-
side groups, will hold people account-
able and say: Why would you be
against an agreement that is better,
even if it is not perfect from your point
of view?
By the way, no trade agreement is
absolutely perfect. Every one of us
would negotiate something slightly dif-
ferent. It is a question of trying to
make sure you don’t make the agree-
ment, which is not perfect, the enemy
of the good, and the good is to go to
this new agreement.
There was an outside, independent
study done by the International Trade
Commission showing that 176,000 new
jobs will be added to the U.S. economy
just from this agreement alone. So this
is better.
So the bottom line is, do we continue
under the outdated NAFTA or do we
adopt these new USMCA standards
that will allow us to compete better in
the global 21st century economy?
A vote against the USMCA, again, is
a vote for the status quo, without en-
forceable labor and environmental
standards, with a nonexistent digital
economy provision, and with rules of
origin that allow more automobiles
and auto parts to be manufactured
overseas instead of in America. USMCA
addresses and solves all those prob-
lems.
I put together a little handy chart to
talk about some of these specific provi-
sions.
USMCA will create 176,000 new jobs.
NAFTA? None.
Enforceable labor and environmental
standards. USMCA, yes, checkmark,
enforceable. Enforceable under
NAFTA? No.
Rules for the internet economy, new
rules, again, to help small businesses,
internet economy, checkmark.
NAFTA? No.
Seventy percent of the steel in vehi-
cles has to be made in North America.
That is a new provision. It is not in any
other trade agreement, by the way. Yes
on USMCA; no on NAFTA.
Finally, 40 to 45 percent of the vehi-
cles must be made by workers earning
at least 16 bucks an hour. NAFTA, no;
USMCA, yes.
So it is pretty clear to me, if you ac-
tually are honest about this and you
look at it objectively and you say here
are these two opportunities, which way
would you go?
So I hope my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle take a look at this and
apply logic and say: It might not be
perfect. I might have wanted a little
more here or there, but be sure that
you are supporting what works for
your workers.
If we can get this agreement passed,
the President will sign it. It will make
a difference for employees, for farmers,
workers, service providers in my home
State of Ohio and around the country.
Mr. HOEVEN. I want to thank the
Senator from Ohio. I introduced him as
the Senator from Ohio because that is
what he is right now, but I could have
also said that he is the former USTR,
U.S. Trade Ambassador, so I guess I
could have said Ambassador Portman,
and he was also the Director of the Of-
fice of Management and Budget. So
when he gets up and talks about the
comparison of USMCA versus NAFTA,
he certainly knows what he is talking
about, and I appreciate his being here
and the compelling case he makes
based on many years of work and truly
understanding these trade agreements
and being part of developing them.
So, again, my thanks to the Senator
from Ohio. I appreciate him very much.
Now I am going to turn to somebody
who appreciates the farmer the way I
do, and that is the junior Senator from
Iowa.
Ms. ERNST. Thank you to the senior
Senator from North Dakota for his
great work in pulling us all together. A
number of us on the floor really appre-
ciate the agricultural sector. We heard
from my senior Senator just a bit ago.
Why am I so enthused about the
USMCA? It is because, in the great
State of Iowa, one out of every five
jobs is tied to trade.
Over 87,000—87,000—farms make Iowa
our Nation’s top egg, pork, corn, soy-
bean, and ethanol producer.
With Canada and Mexico being two of
our biggest trading partners, the
United States-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment—or what we have been talking
about here, the USMCA—is a huge deal
for the State of Iowa.
Last year alone, my home State of
Iowa exported $6.6 billion worth of
products to just Canada and Mexico.
That is more than we exported to our
next 27 top export markets all com-
bined—27 combined, and it still wasn’t
greater than what we send to Mexico
and Canada.
This deal will allow those numbers to
grow exponentially by creating new ex-
port opportunities for our dairy indus-
try, greater access for our egg pro-
ducers, and reducing nontariff trade
barriers that previously hampered our
exporting abilities.
So it is critical—it is critical—that
we get the USMCA across the finish
line, not just for the sake of getting a
tremendous win for our agriculture
community but finalizing a deal that
will impact the livelihoods of our hard-
working Iowans and all Americans
across the country.
Ninety-five percent of the world’s
population lives outside of the United
States of America, which makes our
exports all that more important.
Having USMCA in place means cer-
tainty—certainty in a time where
prices have been low and markets have
been eroded from other trade negotia-
tions.
This trade deal preserves our duty-
free access to Mexican and Canadian
markets, which many of our ag pro-
ducers and manufacturers benefit from.
I have heard from countless equip-
ment dealers and processors all the
way down to the farmers growing the
crops and raising our hogs. Ratifying
this agreement will be a shot of posi-
tive energy into their businesses, their
homes, and to folks all across rural
America.
When it comes to trade with our
neighbors to the north and the south,
it is simple. We need the USMCA
passed through Congress as soon as
possible.
It has already been ratified by Mex-
ico; they are done. The deal is done
with Mexico, and it looks like Canada
is set to follow suit.
The USMCA was signed on November
30 of 2018. That is right—2018. That is
228 days ago—228 days. I would say it is
about time that Speaker PELOSI and
our friends in the House signal their
full support for this agreement.
It is time to get moving. We have to
get this deal done. We have to get it
across the finish line. Iowa’s farmers,
manufacturers, and small businesses
are counting on us to get this done.
With that, I would like to say: Go,
USMCA. Thank you to the senior Sen-
ator from North Dakota for gathering
us together. I think this is a really im-
portant topic for all of us to focus on.
Mr. HOEVEN. I want to thank the
Senator from Iowa and turn to some-
body who, although he is very young,
has been working very hard for agri-
culture for a very long time, and that
is the Senator from Kansas, who also
happens to be our Ag Committee chair-
man.
Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I
thank Senator HOEVEN for getting us
together for a colloquy with everybody
who is concerned about this.
This is what we do on the Agriculture
Committee, working in a bipartisan
way when we see an opportunity, and
certainly we ought to seize this oppor-
tunity.
I thank the Senator from North Da-
kota for leading this. He is an out-
standing champion on behalf of agri-
culture, and he is always riding the
posse, which I truly appreciate.
I also thank Senator BRAUN from In-
diana, a new and valued member of the
Ag Committee, for pointing out some
of the obstacles we face. Unfortu-
nately, they tend to be on a partisan
basis. There are extraneous things that

need to be talked about, and I know
Senator PORTMAN just brought that up
with his chart, but I thank him for his
participation.
Senator GRASSLEY, who is a very val-
ued member of the Ag Committee,
chairman of the Finance Committee—
and obviously that is the committee of
jurisdiction—who has especially point-
ed out, and as Senator ERNST has
pointed out, the value of agriculture to
Iowa and, for that matter, all of the
country.
Senator BOOZMAN, who talked about
Arkansas, is a valued member of the
committee as well, next to the chair in
terms of seniority.
Senator PORTMAN, as has been point-
ed out, is the former Trade Representa-
tive. On the chart, he simply pointed
out in detail why this new agreement
is far superior to NAFTA and we are
working with, as Senator GRASSLEY
pointed out, working groups in the
House, with our lead negotiator, and I
hope that works out. I certainly hope
it works out.
Senator ERNST has been an out-
standing champion for farmers in Iowa
and all around the country. She is on
the committee and has compassion and
also pointed out the need for certainty.
Now, since NAFTA was signed into
law, the result has been that Canada
and Mexico have been two of our
strongest trading partners.
I worked on NAFTA back in the day
when I was in the House and served as
ranking member, and the Honorable
Kika de la Garza was the chairman. We
went all over the country working on
NAFTA.
The result with that agreement—and
every State could say the same thing,
but we are talking about 110,000 jobs in
Kansas. Those jobs are across all sec-
tors of agriculture now, and many are
tied to agriculture and the entire agri-
culture value chain. NAFTA secured
greater market access for our farmers,
our ranchers, our growers, everybody
in between, and for our producers.
Today, over one-quarter of our coun-
try’s agriculture exports are destined
for Canada and/or Mexico.
As with every trade agreement, there
is always room for improvement. It has
been pointed out by all of my col-
leagues that the United States-Mexico-
Canada Agreement—the acronym for
that is USMCA. I did suggest it could
also be for United States Marine Corps
Always, but that is the acronym we are
using. It has modernized the trade pact
we have benefited from for over 20
years. The U.S. agriculture industry
desperately needs this trade agreement
now to offer greater certainty and pre-
dictability regarding demand in the
marketplace, certainly in predict-
ability.
That is what we promised in the farm
bill, and we passed the farm bill in this
body with 87 votes. That is a record
vote, based on the premise that the
most important thing we do is provide
certainty and predictability for our
farmers and ranchers and growers.
As chairman of the Senate Ag Com-
mittee, I have heard directly, person-
ally, as all my colleagues have, from
producers and the broader agriculture
industry regarding our challenging
farm economy.
Every day our farmers, ranchers, and
growers experience incredible chal-
lenges, including weather variability,
and that is putting it mildly. I do not
know what we have done to Mother Na-
ture for her to act in this fashion.
In Kansas, the wheat harvest is a
month late, and farmers still can’t get
in their fields up in the northwest part,
but, amazingly, the yield is pretty
good; the protein is staying about the
same; and we have seen a little bit—a
little bit—of price recovery. We need a
lot more.
The uncertainty regarding the U.S.
trade policy has led some of our most
important trading partners to turn to
our competitors. That is sadly true. At
a time when the U.S. agriculture indus-
try is facing new trade retaliation
threats on top of the challenging agri-
culture economy, we must offer greater
certainty and predictability for the
farmers and ranchers across the coun-
try.
I cannot emphasize enough how seri-
ous this is. This is the fourth or fifth
year that we have experienced this sit-
uation. Some farmers and ranchers
who produce—not all but some—are in
a desperate situation.
Congressional passage of USMCA
would be—will be—should be—a pivotal
step toward restoring the United
States as a reliable supplier, not to
mention tangible benefits.
I urge my colleagues—especially in
the House—to get together with Am-
bassador Lighthizer and work out these
concerns that have been talked about—
especially by Senator GRASSLEY—and
to give fair and swift consideration to
this new trade agreement. We must ex-
pand critical market access and create
new trade opportunities for U.S. agri-
culture.
I again thank Senator HOEVEN for his
leadership and for sponsoring this col-
loquy.
Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the Senator
from Kansas and our Agriculture Com-
mittee chairman.
Madam President, I ask unanimous
consent for up to an additional 3 min-
utes of time to allow the Senator from
Colorado to make a few remarks, and
then we would turn to the Senator
from Vermont for his comments.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I
turn to the Senator from Colorado.
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I
thank our colleague from Vermont for
the accommodation of this extra time.
USMCA is incredibly important to
the State of Colorado. Colorado is a
pro-trade State. We have about 750,000
trade-related jobs in Colorado. Of those
750,000 jobs, almost 250,000 are related
to trade with Mexico and Canada.
Nearly a quarter million of Colorado’s
workers are there because of trade with
Canada and Mexico. It is a nearly $5
billion share of our economy—that is,
the total number of goods, services,
and exports to Canada and Mexico.
That was a couple of years ago, so that
number has obviously increased.
Of the potatoes Mexico imports from
the United States, nearly half come
from Colorado. If you look at bev-
erages, 97 percent of the beverages
Mexico imports come from Colorado. If
you look at crowns, closures, seals, 96
percent of those items exported or im-
ported by Mexico come from Colorado.
If you look at miscellaneous leather
products, the hides and other products
that Mexico imports, 87 percent of
them come from Colorado.
We know NAFTA has created thou-
sands of jobs in Colorado. We know it
has added thousands of dollars to peo-
ple’s incomes. We know USMCA is a
better, stronger opportunity for us to
gain even more jobs, more income, and
more opportunity for the people of Col-
orado. So I thank Senator HOEVEN for
bringing people together on the floor to
talk about the importance of free trade
and particularly the passage of
USMCA.
I hope our colleagues in the House
will hear this call to a brighter eco-
nomic future, more trade opportuni-
ties, and greater U.S. leadership by
moving the USMCA, adopting it, and
putting it forward so the Senate can
act on it and getting this agreement
into law so we can actually once again
start rebuilding opportunities with
trade.
I am strongly supportive of this ef-
fort. It is good for Colorado, and it is
good for this country.
I thank my colleague from North Da-
kota and my colleague from Vermont.
Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I
thank the Senator from Colorado.
Again, the message is clear: We need to
pass USMCA, and we urge our col-
leagues not only in this Chamber but
in the House to do that and get this
done for our country, across all sectors
of our economy.
With that, I turn to the Senator from
Vermont and express my thanks and
appreciation to him.
Madam President, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont.
DEATH OF JAMAL KHASHOGGI
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the
U.N. Special Rapporteur on
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary
killings, Ms. Agnes Callamard, re-
cently released her report on the mur-
der of Jamal Khashoggi after a 6-
month investigation. I encourage ev-
eryone to read the report, and I want
to share several of her findings.
First, Mr. Khashoggi was murdered
and dismembered inside the Saudi con-
sulate in Istanbul. It was an
extrajudicial killing that violated nu-
merous international laws, and for
which the Government of Saudi Arabia
is responsible.
Second, there is credible evidence
warranting further investigation of the

liability of high-level Saudi officials,
especially the Crown Prince.
Third, once Turkey publicly an-
nounced Mr. Khashoggi’s murder, the
Saudi Government used consular im-
munity to obstruct Turkey’s investiga-
tion until the crime scene could be
cleaned, and there are reasons to con-
clude that the destruction of evidence
could not have taken place without the
Crown Prince’s knowledge.
Fourth, Saudi officials falsely denied
knowledge of Mr. Khashoggi’s murder
for more than 2 weeks, and they con-
tinue to deny state responsibility.
Fifth, the trial of the suspects who
have been charged in Saudi Arabia will
not deliver justice or the whole truth.
Sixth, Jamal Khashoggi’s remains
have yet to be located and turned over
to his family.
Some have ignored the findings in
the report, as the lobbyists who con-
tinue to rake in millions of dollars
from the Saudi Government have en-
couraged, and as the Trump adminis-
tration appears inclined to do. But ig-
noring the facts doesn’t change what
happened. And it bears repeating: The
fact is, a journalist was murdered by
the Saudi Government in a manner
that implicates officials at the highest
level in the royal family. The fact is,
the Saudi Government engaged in a fla-
grant coverup and continues to deny
any responsibility. The fact is, the
steps being taken to pursue justice are
a sham.
After the report was released, the
Saudi Foreign Minister dismissed its
finding as not containing any new in-
formation—as if the murder, coverup,
and lack of accountability are irrele-
vant because they have been previously
reported.
While many of the summary findings
in the report may not be new, they are
supported by roughly 100 pages of de-
tailed information in which the Special
Rapporteur and her team document of-
ficial reports from the U.S., Saudi, and
Turkish Governments, they include
quotes from interviews conducted
around the world, and they share ex-
cerpts of the gruesome intelligence in-
formation to which they had access.
Ms. Callamard presented the facts,
her own conclusions, and the method-
ology used to reach those conclusions,
and she was clear about where there
were limitations of her inquiry. The re-
port shows a meticulous and objective
effort to find the truth. For that rea-
son, it stands in stark contrast to the
approach taken by both the Saudi Gov-
ernment and the Trump administra-
tion.
The Special Rapporteur also made
several recommendations, including
some that are directed specifically to
the United States. They include the
following:
Open an FBI investigation into the
murder of Mr. Khashoggi, and pursue
criminal prosecutions within the
United States as appropriate.
Make a determination under the
Global Magnitsky Human Rights Ac-
countability Act regarding the respon-
sibility of the Crown Prince, the de
facto ruler of Saudi Arabia.
To the greatest extent possible, con-
sistent with national security, declas-
sify materials relating to the murder of
Mr. Khashoggi.
And hold congressional hearings on
the responsibility of top Saudi officials
and demand access to the relevant clas-
sified materials.
After Ms. Callamard’s report was re-
leased, President Trump, just like the
Saudi Foreign Minister, dismissed its
findings. He made clear he intends to
take no action in response to the re-
port.
In addition, despite Secretary
Pompeo’s repeated claim that the ad-
ministration is ‘‘committed to holding
each individual accountable’’ in the
murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the facts
indicate the opposite. The administra-
tion continues to refuse to adhere to
its legal requirements—refuses to fol-
low the law—under the Magnitsky Act
to determine liability in the murder,
including the liability of the Crown
Prince.
In fact, President Trump has made
no effort to conceal that the adminis-
tration’s complicity in protecting the
Saudi royal family is linked to billions
of dollars in sales of U.S. weapons to
the Saudi Government. During an
interview shortly after the report was
released, the President admitted to not
raising the U.N. report with the Crown
Prince, and said: ‘‘Saudi Arabia’s a big
buyer of American products; that
means something to me.’’
Asked whether Saudi Arabia paid the
right price for the United States ‘‘to
look the other way,’’ President Trump
said: ‘‘No, no. But I’m not like a fool
that says, ‘We don’t want to do busi-
ness with them . . . Take their
money.’ ’’
I was a prosecutor for 8 years. The
fact that premeditated murder is being
condoned because of billions of dollars
in Saudi money is unconscionable.
According to President Trump, our
relations with Saudi Arabia should not
change regardless of the outcome of
any investigation. Think about that.
The President is saying that no matter
what the evidence shows, no matter
how compelling the evidence impli-
cating the Crown Prince in murder and
obstruction of justice, that should not
affect our relations with the Saudi
Government. That is a shocking state-
ment.
Instead, the administration has lim-
ited its response to imposing sanctions
only against individuals who report-
edly carried out the murder, as well as
a few other officials believed to have
played a role in ordering or facilitating
the operation, and has argued that, by
doing so, it has fulfilled its commit-
ment to pursuing justice.
It is the same as what the Saudi Gov-
ernment has done—claim to be holding
the hit men accountable while absolv-
ing the Saudi leadership and royal fam-
ily of any responsibility.
Yet the Special Rapporteur has
rightly emphasized that the pursuit of
justice for Jamal Khashoggi and his
family is about finding the truth.
Secretary Pompeo recently spoke
about the need to ensure that our prin-
ciples guide our policy. That is a view
I share, but I have to wonder what he
meant by that pious statement. What
principles was he talking about? There
is no evidence that the administration
is being guided by principle in the
Khashoggi case. To the contrary, there
is every reason to believe this adminis-
tration has made a calculated decision
to do the opposite. In fact, the Presi-
dent has said as much.
There should be nothing controver-
sial about holding accountable a gov-
ernment that systemically represses
and abuses its own people, that is cur-
rently arbitrarily detaining American
citizens whom it has also reportedly
tortured, that has repeatedly com-
mitted war crimes in Yemen that po-
tentially implicate the United States,
and that is responsible for the premedi-
tated murder of a widely respected
journalist.
I hope other Senators will join me in
calling on the Trump administration to
lead the international community by
example. Our government should put
Special Rapporteur Callamard’s rec-
ommendations into practice, and we
should urge other governments to do
the same.

TRADE
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, a
number of my colleagues were here just
a few moments ago talking about trade
and the impact of trade on agriculture.
I have been down here a lot on the floor
to talk about the ag economy in recent
weeks. If you look at our economy as a
whole, it is thriving, but our Nation’s
farmers and ranchers are still having a
tough time, thanks to years of com-
modity and livestock prices that are
below production cost because of pro-
tracted trade disputes and now, on top
of that, natural disasters.
One of the most important things we
can do to help our agricultural econ-
omy is to negotiate favorable trade
agreements for U.S. producers. Our Na-
tion’s farmers and ranchers depend on
trade. In my home State of South Da-
kota, we export a substantial portion
of the agricultural products we
produce.
Right now, though, farmers and
ranchers are facing a lot of uncertainty
when it comes to trade. There are a
number of outstanding trade agree-
ments, and farmers and ranchers are
unsure what the rules of the road are
going to look like in the future. That is
why I have urged the administration to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4846 July 16, 2019
wrap up negotiations on the various
trade deals under consideration as
swiftly as possible.
I strongly support the administra-
tion’s goal of strengthening market ac-
cess for our Nation’s farmers and
ranchers, and we have made real
progress in negotiations. Now it is time
to push for a conclusion to these deals
and give our Nation’s agricultural pro-
ducers certainty about what inter-
national markets are going to look
like.
There is one deal, however, that we
don’t need to wait for; that is, the
United States-Mexico-Canada Free
Trade Agreement. Negotiations on this
trade agreement are finished. Mexico
has already passed the agreement, and
Canada is just waiting for the United
States to act. All we need is for Speak-
er PELOSI to indicate her willingness to
take up this deal, and the President
will formally submit the agreement to
Congress for approval.
The United States-Mexico-Canada
Free Trade Agreement is a big win for
our Nation’s farmers and ranchers.
Canada and Mexico are the No. 1 and
No. 2 export markets for American food
and agricultural products. The United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will
preserve and expand farmers’ access to
these critical markets and give farmers
certainty about what these markets
will look like long term.
I am particularly pleased with the
improvements the agreement makes
for U.S. dairy producers. Dairy is an
important and rapidly growing indus-
try in South Dakota. Drive the I–29
corridor north of Brookings, and you
can see firsthand what massive dairy
expansion we have experienced in
South Dakota over the past few years.
The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement
will preserve U.S. dairy farmers’ role
as a key dairy supplier to Mexico, and
it will substantially expand market ac-
cess in Canada, where U.S. dairy sales
have been restricted.
The U.S. International Trade Com-
mission estimates that the agreement
will boost U.S. dairy exports by more
than $277 million. The agreement will
also expand market access for U.S.
poultry and egg producers. It will make
it easier for U.S. producers to export
wheat to Canada.
I have spent my time today talking
about the agricultural industry, but, of
course, this agreement goes much fur-
ther. The United States-Mexico-Canada
Agreement will benefit virtually every
sector of our economy, from manufac-
turing to digital services to the auto-
motive industry. It will create 176,000
new jobs, grow our economy, and raise
wages for workers.
It is time to pass this agreement and
to realize its economic benefits. Senate
Republicans are ready; we are ready to
approve this agreement once the White
House submits it to Congress. We are
just waiting for Democratic leaders in
the House to indicate their willingness
to take up the deal. It is time for them
to do so.
Democrats’ concerns have been more
than addressed throughout the negotia-
tion process. The final trade agreement
is perhaps the most worker-friendly
trade agreement the United States has
ever considered. It is a big improve-
ment on the North American Free
Trade Agreement—the agreement
under which we are currently oper-
ating—on the issues over which Demo-
crats have expressed concern.
If they are serious about making
progress on these issues and are not
just trying to sink the U.S.-Mexico-
Canada Agreement with specious objec-
tions, Democrats should give the Presi-
dent the go-ahead and take up and pass
this agreement in the near future.
NOMINATION OF PETER JOSEPH PHIPPS
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I
rise to speak in support of the nomina-
tion of Judge Peter Phipps of the U.S.
District Court for the Western District
of Pennsylvania to be a U.S. Circuit
Judge for the Third Circuit.
Judge Phipps is highly qualified to
serve on the Third Circuit. He has dedi-
cated his legal career to public service,
first as a decorated career attorney at
the U.S. Department of Justice and
now as a Federal trial judge. As both a
judge and a lawyer, he has been a faith-
ful adherent to the rule of law.
Senator CASEY and I supported Judge
Phipps’ nomination to the district
court. He was recommended to us by
the bipartisan judicial advisory panel
that we use to vet and recommend can-
didates to fill district court vacancies
in the Western District of Pennsyl-
vania. In 2018, the Senate easily con-
firmed Judge Phipps to the district
court by voice vote after the Senate
Judiciary Committee reported him to
the floor by voice vote.
Before joining the bench, Judge
Phipps served for 15 years as a career
attorney in the U.S. Department of
Justice’s Civil Division, where he
worked under three Presidential ad-
ministrations of both parties. He rep-
resented the Federal Government in
numerous complex cases and received
multiple awards for his excellent work.
Since 2014, he has served as an adjunct
law professor at Duquesne University,
where he teaches administrative law.
Earlier in his career, he clerked for
Chief Judge Guy Cole on the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and
worked as a commercial litigator in
private practice. Judge Phipps is a
graduate of the University of Dayton
and Stanford Law School.
Judge Phipps has an outstanding rep-
utation for intelligence, profes-
sionalism, fairness, and integrity, but
you do not have to take my word for it.
Here are few examples of how others
have described him.
The American Bar Association has
rated him well-qualified on the basis of
his integrity, professional competence,
and judicial temperament. Minority
Leader SCHUMER and Senator LEAHY,
the former chairman of the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee, have called the
American Bar Association’s rating
‘‘the gold standard by which judicial
candidates are judged.’’
Senator GRAHAM, the chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, stated
after Judge Phipps’ nomination hear-
ing on June 5, 2019 that Judge Phipps
‘‘is one of the most impressive nomi-
nees for the U.S. Circuit Courts that
has appeared before the Committee. He
is incredibly smart and well balanced.
Mr. Phipps will be a great addition to
the Third Circuit.’’
At Judge Phipps’ district court inves-
titure on December 18, 2018, Chief
Judge Cole of the Sixth Circuit, an ap-
pointee of President Bill Clinton, said
that Judge Phipps ‘‘has earned a rep-
utation for honesty, trustworthiness,
great character, humility and profes-
sionalism.’’ In addition, Chief Judge
Cole stated that Judge Phipps ‘‘has a
brilliant mind, endless curiosity, and
an even temperament. He will treat all
who come before him equally and apply
a strong work ethic to each and every
matter. In short, Judge Phipps will be
fair and just in the truest sense of
those words.’’
Leon Panetta, Secretary of Defense
under President Barack Obama, has
written to the Senate in support of
Judge Phipps’ nomination. He worked
closely with Judge Phipps on a legal
matter when he was Secretary of De-
fense. His letter states: ‘‘Throughout
the many hours we spent with one an-
other I was repeatedly impressed by
Peter’s legal acumen, dedication, at-
tention to detail, and integrity. I have
come to know Peter to be a faithful
public servant and an excellent attor-
ney. I am very pleased that he has been
nominated to give his time and talents
to the bench. I believe Peter will serve
with honor and highly recommend his
confirmation.’’
The Senate has also received enthusi-
astic letters of support for Judge
Phipps’ nomination from attorneys
who have litigated with and against
him, including former colleagues from
the U.S. Department of Justice. For in-
stance, one group of attorneys praised
Judge Phipps as a ‘‘model jurist’’ who
has a ‘‘piercing intellect’’ and ‘‘deep
knowledge of the law.’’ Similarly, a
group of his former colleagues from the
U.S. Department of Justice wrote:
‘‘Judge Phipps’ generosity, perspective,
commitment to the rule of law, and
selflessness—in addition to his intel-
ligence and extensive experience—will
make him a superb appellate judge.’’
I am confident that Judge Phipps
will live up to this high praise on the
Third Circuit. He has all the essential
qualities needed to excel as a Federal
appellate judge: experience, intel-
ligence, integrity, and respect for the
limited role of the judiciary in our con-
stitutional system. I am pleased to
support this highly qualified nominee
and urge my colleagues to do the same.
Mr. THUNE. I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRAMER). Under the previous order, the
question is, Will the Senate advise and
consent to the Phipps nomination?

foreseeably relevant’’ and insert ‘‘such infor-
mation as is individualized and relevant to
an individual investigation’’.
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, for several
years now, I have been working on tax
treaties that we have with other coun-
tries to try to protect Americans’ pri-
vacy. I think it is very important that
your personal information—what you
buy with your credit card, what checks
you write, and what you do with your
bank account—is private. It is yours,
and it is not to be sifted through or
rummaged through by the government.
I am very, very concerned that, over
time, particularly with technology, the
IRS is gaining too much power at the
push of a button to simply sift through
our bank accounts looking for anoma-
lies.
I think it is important that we pro-
tect Americans who live overseas.
About 8 million Americans live over-
seas, and I think the vast majority of
them are law-abiding citizens.
This debate has been going on for
several years now. I first tried to en-
gage the Obama administration in this.
We had meeting after meeting but no
meaningful engagement. Currently, we
have been involved in negotiations
with the Trump administration, which
has been more open to discussions of
how we protect Americans’ privacies.
Unfortunately, these negotiations were
sabotaged by the Republican leader,
who chose to bring these tax treaties
forward at a time when we were in the
middle of negotiations. This is very
disappointing to me because I think we
were at the point of actually achieving
a deal that would protect the privacy
of Americans. This process has been se-
verely damaged and short-circuited by
the Republican leader’s choosing to
push this forward and destroy the ne-
gotiations that we were having at the
time.
When we look at these treaties, and
we say, ‘‘well, how could we make
them better,’’ there are ways that we
could actually make them better.
There are also ways that these treaties
could have come up at any point in
time in the past. No one Senator can
really block legislation. The fact that
this legislation hasn’t come up for sev-
eral years is really due to the fact that
the Republican leader has failed to en-
gage in any meaningful compromise or
discussion over these.
The treaties are being brought up
against my objections now. So they
could have been brought up against my
objections 2 years ago, 4 years ago, or
6 years ago. Really, the fault and the
responsibility for the delay of these tax
treaties lies squarely at the foot of the
Republican leader, who has failed to
engage on this subject and has, rather,
chosen at the end just to rush them
through without any meaningful de-
bate.
Americans are constitutionally guar-
anteed to be free from unreasonable,
suspicionless search—or at least we
used to be. Today this Chamber begins
consideration of four tax treaties, and
each one of them contains provisions
that would violate the fundamental
right to be free from unreasonable
searches.
To be sure, these treaties would be-
stow benefits to the United States and
our trading partners, and those provi-
sions have my support. In fact, I have
said for years now that I support the
gist of the treaties and that they try to
prevent double taxation and they make
it easier for companies to do business
overseas, as well as to do business in
our country. That is why I have said
from the beginning: Let’s negotiate a
settlement. Let’s try to put taxpayer
protections into the treaties. But at
every point we have been stymied.
I don’t think the benefits of these
treaties should come at the grave ex-
pense of violating the rights of every
American with a foreign bank account,
regardless of whether there is a shred
of evidence that a crime has been com-
mitted.
These treaties make it easier for tax
authorities, such as the IRS, to obtain
an American citizen’s bank deposit ac-
count information. Previously, the IRS
could only obtain such information if
it was necessary to address a tax dis-
pute, but that is not the standard these
treaties will keep. In the past, there
had to be at least an accusation of
wrongdoing, an accusation of fraud, or
an accusation that a taxpayer was
doing something against the law. These
treaties, though, would allow the IRS—
the government Agency that instills
terror in every citizen it contacts, the
government Agency that has almost
limitless power to put anybody out of
business—to obtain individual bank ac-
count records if that information is
‘‘foreseeably relevant’’ or ‘‘may be rel-
evant.’’
Think for a minute what the stand-
ard is here. So if you happen to be an
American who does business overseas,
if it may be relevant, the government
can look in your bank account. Really,
the standard is ‘‘may be relevant’’ to
the Tax Code, ‘‘may be relevant’’ to a
question, instead of ‘‘is relevant’’ to an
active investigation concerning wrong-
doing by a taxpayer. I think this is a
big mistake. It is going to lead to bulk
transfer of information from countries
back and forth.
We live in an era where some people
leave one country or another, hoping
to get away from totalitarianism and
hoping to get away from the snooping
authorities that may well debit their
account or control their account based
on their political behavior. I think it is
a mistake to allow the information to
be transferred back and forth without
any kind of standard. The standard is
‘‘foreseeably relevant,’’ or ‘‘may be rel-
evant.’’ What kind of standard is that?
Historically, the standard required,
at the very least, is an accusation of a
crime. It will no longer require that.
Will it require suspicion of a crime?
No, it will require anything the govern-
ment asks that it may be relevant to
the treaty, that it may be relevant to
the Tax Code, which is basically no
standard at all. No American overseas
will have any kind of protection of
their privacy.
Some recent international court de-
cisions have provided an idea as to
what meets this new standard. Accord-
ing to the Swiss Federal Supreme
Court, under the new standard of these
new tax treaties and the ‘‘foreseeably
relevant’’ standard, an information re-
quest will only be denied if the link be-
tween the requested data and the infor-
mation is improbable. No consideration
is necessary as to whether there is rea-
sonable suspicion of a crime. People
can go after the information, basically,
based on no accusation of a crime or no
suspicion of a crime. It will be a fishing
expedition.
Perhaps we should thank the Swiss
Federal Supreme Court for effectively
telling us what we already knew, that
the ‘‘foreseeably relevant’’ standard is
really no standard at all.
At a time when the United States is
over $22 trillion in debt and running
annual trillion-dollar deficits, these
treaties would empower the IRS to ob-
tain sensitive bank account informa-
tion under the weakest of pretenses. In
short, the information is exchanged
with no questions asked, no reasonable
suspicion, and no due process in an ef-
fort to swell the coffers of the U.S.
Treasury.
I am outraged by this. The Senate
should be outraged, and the American
people should be outraged that their
liberties are so cavalierly cast aside to
accommodate the IRS’s perpetual
search for more taxpayers to shake
down.
My amendment to the treaties would
end bulk exchanges of financial records
by simply mandating that the United
States and our treaty partners would
exchange information only if an identi-
fied individual is subject to an indi-
vidual investigation related to the en-
forcement of the Tax Code. I am not
against going after people not paying
their taxes, but I am against going
after the 8 million Americans who live
overseas and are just trying to abide by
the laws and just trying to earn a liv-
ing.
While those who have evaded their
tax obligations must be held to ac-
count, the power to search and seize is
not absolute in the United States or in
any free country. A government dedi-
cated to securing the blessings of lib-
erty does not allow the IRS to rum-
mage through our bank accounts hop-
ing to find a crime.
Obtaining the deposit account infor-
mation of an American should be done
on an individualized basis without re-
sorting to indiscriminate sweeps of
sensitive information gathering.
I urge every Senator to stand up for
the Fourth Amendment rights of all
Americans and to support my amend-
ment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4849
July 16, 2019
My amendment would simply do this.
It would put a standard into the trea-
ties that says that there has to be sus-
picion. You have to individualize an in-
vestigation. You can’t push a button
and search through 8 million Ameri-
cans’ bank records overseas. If we
allow this to go without personal pri-
vacy protections, we are setting our-
selves up for a dystopian nightmare,
where the government looks at every
transaction, every purchase, and every-
thing we do in our lives. It is a big mis-
take to let this go.
There is no reason why this couldn’t
be corrected.
I have spoken to the countries in-
volved, and they have assured me that
there is not a problem at all with mak-
ing these amendment changes to the
treaties. Yet they have fallen on deaf
ears.
It is a sad day for Americans tax-
payers and a sad day for privacy that
these tax treaties are being rushed
through. I strongly object and hope
other Senators will consider voting for
taxpayer privacy.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho.
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the vote take
place after the completion of my re-
marks.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President and fellow
Senators, today the Senate is consid-
ering four tax protocols. These trea-
ties—and these are treaties—have been
approved by substantial bipartisan ma-
jorities in the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee in multiple successive Con-
gresses. Two of these four protocols
were reported out of committee with-
out objection during the four most re-
cent Congresses. It is in the interest of
U.S. taxpayers that these be approved,
and it is time for these to be approved.
I am honored that on my watch, we
have finally brought these to the floor
and brought them here at this moment
to actually adopt these treaties, which
will be adopted when the vote is called.
Tax treaties benefit U.S. businesses
and citizens in a number of ways. Tax
treaties create certainty for the busi-
ness community. They promote a fa-
vorable business environment by mini-
mizing uncertainty and helping U.S.
businesses grow.
In the case of Americans working and
conducting business abroad, tax trea-
ties are indispensable in that respect.
Tax treaties facilitate trade and in-
vestment by preventing double tax-
ation. They provide U.S. taxpayers and
investors with greater clarity about
their tax burden. They provide tools to
ensure that U.S. taxpayers are treated
equally and fairly overseas, allowing
them to invest and compete abroad
with the knowledge that they will not
face discriminatory barriers.
Tax treaties strengthen the ability of
U.S. businesses to explore new opportu-
nities abroad by establishing a predict-
able framework for how a tax burden
will be assessed. These treaties also
provide tools to help resolve tax dis-
putes between the United States and
our tax treaty partners. Without these
tools, U.S. investors would have lim-
ited ability to resolve these problems
on their own.
It is not just businesses that benefit
from tax treaties. These treaties im-
pose reasonable limits in the amount of
tax the other country can impose on a
U.S. person who might live or work
overseas. Tax treaties help us ensure
that the United States can maintain an
appropriate tax base by preventing tax
fraud.
One of our colleagues has raised con-
cerns about how the treaties deal with
individual privacy and sensitive infor-
mation. These treaties protect tax-
payer information in a manner con-
sistent with decades-long, established
standards and practices under U.S. do-
mestic law. These standards and prac-
tices have been upheld by the U.S. Su-
preme Court for more than half of a
century. They have been used by ad-
ministrations of both parties for dec-
ades. Changing the standard now would
create confusion related to global ad-
ministration of our tax laws.
I do not view this issue as an impedi-
ment or a change to how these matters
have been successfully handled in the
past. I ask my colleagues to oppose any
amendments to these treaties. The
treaties are consistent with the U.S.-
modeled tax treaty and with a decades-
long practice of implementing and en-
forcing our tax laws.
To be clear, any amendment to this
resolution that materially changes the
underlying provisions of these treaties
will require acceptance by both our
President and the foreign partner or
the treaty cannot be ratified. These
amendments constitute a material
change to the treaties. They are dam-
aging and would lead to, potentially,
years of further delay when further
delay is simply not acceptable.
These treaties had been held up for 8
years, and I am very pleased that this
week we are finally moving forward in
our role of advice and consent to the
President on these commonsense trea-
ties. It is time to move for the Senate
to act on these treaties and a vote.
I urge my colleagues to approve them
and to vote against the proposed
amendments.
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that Senator PAUL
have up to 5 minutes of debate prior to
the second tranche of votes in this se-
ries.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.

CORRECTION
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4850 July 16, 2019
(Purpose: To provide a reservation to the
Protocol)
In section 1, in the section heading, strike
‘‘DECLARATION AND CONDITIONS’’ and insert
‘‘DECLARATION, CONDITIONS, AND A RESERVA-
TION’’.
In section 1, strike ‘‘declaration of section
2 and the conditions in section 3’’ and insert
‘‘declaration of section 2, the conditions in
section 3, and the reservation in section 4’’.
At the end, add the following:
SEC. 4. RESERVATION.
The advice and consent of the Senate
under section 1 is subject to the following
reservation: In the case of the United States,
the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article XV
shall apply as if the Protocol had entered
into force on January 1, 2019.
Mr. PAUL. I ask unanimous consent
that the reading of the amendment be
waived.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I am
offering a reservation to these treaties
that would maximize the benefit for in-
dividuals and businesses that are im-
pacted by these tax provisions.
My proposed reservation would estab-
lish only for the United States—and
only for our tax purposes—an effective
date of January 1, 2019. By entering
into these treaties, the United States
and our partners are committing to the
same set of tax rules and solving the
problems of double taxation that
plague businesses that operate in sev-
eral countries.
Senate debate on the merits of these
treaties has taken many years, and
there is no reason to punish American
companies that paid their foreign taxes
but then were double-taxed by the IRS
due to the lack of a ratified treaty.
As I have said many times, I support
the benefit of these treaties. I wish we
added privacy protections, but I do sup-
port the benefits of avoiding double
taxation.
I also support making whole those
who have been double-taxed, and I
think it is the right thing to do to
backdate these to the beginning of the
year. My proposed reservation would
grant these companies and the IRS the
additional benefit of having a uniform
tax for 2019.
To give an example of a company in
my State that would benefit, North
American Stainless cannot pay divi-
dends without being subject to double
taxation. If we were to make this ret-
roactive, we would not punish this
company in my State. It is dis-
appointing to me that the senior Sen-
ator from Kentucky led the opposition
to this amendment because it would
stand to greatly benefit a Kentucky
company. It also would stand to great-
ly benefit many companies around the
country if we were simply to make this
retroactive.
We talked to the countries involved,
and there is not one country that ex-
pressed any reservation about this. It
is with great disappointment that I
have to oppose the senior Senator from
Kentucky, who is opposing this amend-
ment and rallying those in the body to
prevent this from being retroactive.
This would in no way slow down the
treaties, and it is inappropriately said
by some that it would. These treaties
would go through with flying colors,
and the reservation would apply only
to our country.
I hope those who are thinking about
how to vote on this will consider vot-
ing to make these treaties start in Jan-
uary 1 of this year.

question is on agreeing to amendment
No. 921.

ME. The motto of our State’s northern-
most community, ‘‘The Little Town

Fort Kent today: a wonderful place to
live, work, and raise families.
Located where the Fish River joins
the St. John River, Fort Kent has a
rich history. For thousands of years,
the region has been the home of the
Micmac and Maliseet. French explor-
ers, led by Samuel de Champlain, first
visited the area in 1604. In the early
1800s, French-speaking Canadians
began settling in the area, laying the
foundation for the robust Acadian cul-
ture that is so important in Maine,
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and as
far away as Louisiana.
The Acadian settlers created a vi-
brant community. They cleared farm-
land, established lumber and grain
mills, schools, and churches. The
namesake of the town is the Fort Kent
Blockhouse, a fort named for then-Gov-
ernor Edward Kent and carefully pre-
served today, which was built in 1839
during a long-running border dispute
between the United States and British
Canada. Settlement to the region in-
creased dramatically when the ‘‘Blood-
less Aroostook War’’ ended peacefully
with a treaty in 1842.
Fort Kent’s dedication to education
began shortly after the town became
established. In 1878, the Madawaska
Training School was established in
Fort Kent, one of the first institutions
in Maine dedicated to preparing stu-
dents for careers as bilingual edu-
cators. That school continues today as
the University of Maine at Fort Kent,
which in 2019 was named for the 14th
consecutive year as one of the best

northeastern colleges by the Princeton
Review. As the only institution in the
United States located at the center of
French culture in northern Maine, the
University of Maine at Fort Kent offers
opportunities for students of all herit-
ages to study and live in a bilingual
community.
Today, more than 60 percent of the
town’s residents speak French, and
they continue to uphold the Acadian
traditions of great food, music, and
dance, and of close-knit families and
lasting friendships. The Maine Acadian
Heritage Council continues to help pre-
serve these traditions and is working
to teach the next generation about the
Acadian heritage through programs
like the Youth Renaissance.
The can-do spirit of Fort Kent is evi-
dent today. It is an agricultural power-
house. and the potato industry remains
an essential part of its economy. The
town is home to an Olympic biathlete
training center and frequently hosts
world-class biathlon competitions. For
26 years, the Can-Am Crown Inter-
national Sled Dog race has attracted
teams from around the world. The
International Muskie Fishing Derby
highlights the valuable fishing grounds
and the pristine environment the peo-
ple of the community work to preserve.
The Fort Kent Ploye Festival cele-
brates the pancake-like dish that is a
staple of Franco-American-Canadian
cuisine.
To my Franco-American friends, it is
a pleasure to congratulate you on this
landmark anniversary. Across the gen-
erations, you have worked hard and
worked together to create a commu-
nity that combines your rich heritage
with the values that define our State
and our Nation.
The celebration of Fort Kent’s 150th
anniversary is not merely about the
passing of time. It is about human ac-
complishment. We celebrate the people
who pulled together, cared for one an-
other, and built a great community.
‘‘The Little Town That Can’’ has a fas-
cinating past and a bright future.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
REMEMBERING LARRY BURNS
∑ Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam Presi-
dent, today I honor the memory of a
distinguished Nevadan: retired Las
Vegas Metropolitan Police Captain
Larry Burns. For decades, Captain
Burns served his community with dis-
tinction, earning the respect of Nevad-
ans from all walks of life.
Captain Burns was raised in Maine
and went on to attend Brigham Young
University in Utah. It was in college
that he met his wife Elizabeth Annie
Burns. After college, he served a 2-year
mission in Ecuador for the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This
began his life’s calling to serve others.
In 1980, he moved to Las Vegas and
worked in construction before becom-
ing a police officer.
Captain Burns’ remarkable career in-
cluded 27 years as a police officer,
where he put his life on the line for Las
Vegas. He became the longest serving
SWAT commander in metro history, a
criminal intelligence section super-
visor and a nationally recognized tac-
tical instructor. He also served as cap-
tain of the Bolden Area Command. Cap-
tain Burns was revered by his col-
leagues for his extraordinary work
ethic, intellect, and devotion to com-
munity.
Throughout his career, Captain
Burns worked hard to build meaningful
relationships with Las Vegans and de-
velop positive ties between community
members and law enforcement officers.
In his spare time, he could often be
found speaking to children at his
church about life as a police officer and
the proud work of serving our commu-
nity. He was also committed to the
idea that people can change and dedi-
cated himself to helping those working
to turn their lives around. He always
offered everything he had to support
the men and women of law enforcement
in making our community a safer place
to live and selflessly upheld his prom-
ise to protect Nevada’s families like he
protected his own. From his work to
rehabilitate the communities he helped
protect to his fierce commitment to
the department, Captain Burns was a
man with unwavering integrity.
Captain Burns lived a life of many
accomplishments, but I have no doubt
that he will be remembered most for
his commitment to family and lasting
contributions to others. He adored his
wife Annie and was most proud of their
life together and their seven wonderful
children, two grandchildren, and their
extended family and friends. I know his
family will continue his rich legacy of
service to others.
All who had the pleasure of knowing
Captain Burns will remember him as a
dedicated public servant who bravely
and tirelessly worked to support our
community. Nevada is a safer place be-
cause of his commitment. We are very
grateful for all of Captain Burns’ con-
tributions, and he will be deeply
missed.∑

TEXT OF AMENDMENTS
SA 925. Mr. THUNE (for Mr.
PORTMAN) proposed an amendment to
the resolution S. Res. 74, marking the
fifth anniversary of Ukraine’s Revolu-
tion of Dignity by honoring the brav-
ery, determination, and sacrifice of the
people of Ukraine during and since the
Revolution, and condemning continued
Russian aggression against Ukraine; as
follows:
Strike the preamble and insert the fol-
lowing:
Whereas, on November 21, 2013, peaceful
protests began on Independence Square
(Maidan) in Kyiv against the decision by the
government of then-President Viktor
Yanukovych to suspend signing the Ukraine-
European Union (EU) Association Agreement
and instead pursue closer ties with the Rus-
sian Federation;
Whereas the Maidan protests, initially re-
ferred to as the Euromaidan, quickly drew
thousands of people and broadened to become
a general demonstration in support of
Ukraine’s integration with the European
Union and against the corrupt Yanukovych
regime;
Whereas, on the night of November 30, 2013,
Ukrainian police forces surrounded and vio-
lently dispersed peaceful protestors on the
Maidan;
Whereas the next day, thousands of
Euromaidan demonstrators regrouped and
resumed the protests for three months, de-
spite facing continuing and increasing vio-
lence from the police;
Whereas, on January 16, 2014, anti-protest
laws, known as the dictatorship laws, were
adopted by the Government of Ukraine,
which sought to restrict the actions of the
Euromaidan protestors;
Whereas these laws were condemned by
Euromaidan protestors as well as Western of-
ficials, including then-Secretary of State
John Kerry, who called them anti-demo-
cratic;
Whereas many of these laws were repealed
just 11 days after being signed into law;
Whereas, on the night of February 18, 2014,
police assaulted and burned down the Trade
Union Building in Kyiv, which had been used
as a headquarters for the Euromaidan move-
ment;
Whereas Yanukovych’s government forces
began using live ammunition against the
Euromaidan movement, leading to the
deaths of more than a hundred protestors
who are now remembered in Ukraine as the
Heavenly Hundred;
Whereas, on February 21, 2014, in the face
of the ongoing Euromaidan protests demand-
ing his resignation, then-President Viktor
Yanukovych fled Kyiv, and then fled Ukraine
the next day;
Whereas, on February 22, 2014, the
Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine recognized that
Yanukovych had ceased his functions as
president, voted him from office, and sched-
uled early presidential elections for May 25,
2014;
Whereas, on February 25, 2014, fulfilling de-
mands of the Maidan, Ukraine’s special po-
lice force known as the Berkut was dis-
solved, as it had been heavily involved in the
violence against the Euromaidan protestors;
Whereas the Ukrainian government’s use
of force against activists throughout the
Euromaidan protests, including the use of
live bullets, was widely condemned by West-
ern governments, including the United
States, and ultimately failed to discourage
the Euromaidan movement;
Whereas, on September 1, 2017, the
Ukraine–EU Association Agreement came
into force after its signing by the Govern-
ment of Ukraine and the EU;
Whereas, in response to Ukraine’s Revolu-
tion of Dignity, the Russian Federation
launched military aggression against
Ukraine, illegally occupied Ukraine’s Cri-
mean Peninsula, and instigated a war in
eastern Ukraine, which is still ongoing and
has killed more than 10,000 Ukrainians;
Whereas the Russian Federation’s at-
tempted invasion and annexation of Crimea
has been widely seen as an effort to stifle
pro-democracy developments across Ukraine
in 2014 in the wake of the Revolution of Dig-
nity;
Whereas 2019 marks the 25th anniversary of
the signing of the Budapest Memorandum,
which committed the United States, the
United Kingdom, and the Russian Federation
to refrain from the threat or use of force
against Ukraine’s territorial integrity in ex-
change for Ukraine giving up its nuclear
weapons;
Whereas the Russian Federation is a signa-
tory to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum and
thus committed to respect the independence,
sovereignty, and territorial integrity of
Ukraine;
Whereas the Government of the Russian
Federation is further obligated to respect
the sovereignty of Ukraine pursuant to its
commitments as a signatory to the Helsinki
Final Act and the Charter of the United Na-
tions;
Whereas, on March 27, 2014, the United Na-
tions General Assembly adopted Resolution
68/262 calling on states and international or-
ganizations not to recognize any change in
Crimea’s status and affirmed the commit-
ment of the United Nations to recognize Cri-
mea as part of Ukraine;
Whereas the United States and European
Union have imposed sanctions on individuals
and entities who have enabled the attempted
invasion, annexation, and occupation of Cri-
mea;
Whereas, pursuant to the Revolution of
Dignity’s goal of fighting corruption in
Ukraine, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine
adopted the Law On the National Anti-Cor-
ruption Bureau (NABU) of Ukraine on Octo-
ber 14, 2014;
Whereas, on June 26, 2018, the Law of
Ukraine On the Establishment of the High
Anti-Corruption Court was signed into law;
Whereas, on July 5, 2018, the Law on Na-
tional Security was signed into law, which
has strengthened civilian control over the
Ukrainian military, increased transparency
in the security sector, and more clearly de-
lineated the powers of law enforcement agen-
cies;
Whereas, on January 6, 2019, the Ecumeni-
cal Patriarch of Constantinople granted
autocephaly to the Ukrainian Orthodox
Church, thus establishing the first inde-
pendent Ukrainian Orthodox Church in over
300 years;
Whereas despite requests by the Govern-
ment of Ukraine, the Government of the
Russian Federation has repeatedly refused to
extradite former President of Ukraine
Viktor Yanukovych to stand trial in
Ukraine;
Whereas, on January 24, 2019, a Ukrainian
court found Yanukovych guilty in absentia
of high treason and complicity in conducting
an aggressive war against Ukraine, and sen-
tenced him to 13 years in prison;
Whereas, in order to help Ukraine preserve
its sovereignty in the face of Russian aggres-
sion, the United States Government has pro-
vided Ukraine with over $1,000,000,000 in se-
curity assistance, including critical defen-
sive items such as Javelin anti-tank missiles
and Island-class cutters;
Whereas, in the 115th Congress, both the
United States Senate and the United States
House of Representatives passed resolutions
commemorating the 85th anniversary of the
Holodomor, the Soviet Union’s manmade
famine that it committed against the people
of Ukraine in 1932 and 1933;
Whereas, on March 31, 2019 and April 21,
2019, Ukraine held the first and second
rounds of its presidential election;
Whereas these elections were widely recog-
nized by international observers as being
free, fair, and conducted without serious,
widespread irregularities;
Whereas the large turnout and civic activ-
ism related to the election highlight the on-
going support of the Ukrainian people for
continued Western integration, political,
economic, and judicial reform, and renewed
anticorruption efforts;
Whereas Volodymyr Zelensky won
Ukraine’s presidential election and was inau-
gurated on May 20, 2019, concluding a peace-
ful transfer of power from former President
Petro Poroshenko; and
Whereas parliamentary elections in
Ukraine are scheduled for July 21, 2019: Now,
therefore, be it
SA 926. Mr. THUNE (for Mr.

July 16, 2019
Whereas the Maidan protests, initially re-
ferred to as the Euromaidan, quickly drew thou-
sands of people and broadened to become a gen-
eral demonstration in support of Ukraine’s inte-
gration with the European Union and against
the corrupt Yanukovych regime;
Whereas, on the night of November 30, 2013,
Ukrainian police forces surrounded and vio-
lently dispersed peaceful protestors on the
Maidan;
Whereas the next day, thousands of
Euromaidan demonstrators regrouped and re-
sumed the protests for three months, despite fac-
ing continuing and increasing violence from the
police;
Whereas, on January 16, 2014, anti-protest
laws, known as the ‘‘dictatorship laws’’, were
adopted by the Government of Ukraine, which
sought to restrict the actions of the Euromaidan
protestors;
Whereas these laws were condemned by
Euromaidan protestors as well as Western offi-
cials, including then-Secretary of State John
Kerry, who called them ‘‘anti-democratic’’;
Whereas many of these laws were repealed
just 11 days after being signed into law;
Whereas, on the night of February 18, 2014,
police assaulted and burned down the Trade
Union Building in Kyiv, which had been used
as a headquarters for the Euromaidan move-
ment;
Whereas Yanukovych’s government forces
began using live ammunition against the
Euromaidan movement, leading to the deaths of
more than a hundred protestors who are now re-
membered in Ukraine as the ‘‘Heavenly Hun-
dred’’;
Whereas, on February 21, 2014, in the face of
the ongoing Euromaidan protests demanding his
resignation, then-President Viktor Yanukovych
fled Kyiv, and then fled Ukraine the next day;
Whereas, on February 22, 2014, the Verkhovna
Rada of Ukraine recognized that Yanukovych
had ceased his functions as president, voted him
from office, and scheduled early presidential
elections for May 25, 2014;
Whereas, on February 25, 2014, fulfilling de-
mands of the Maidan, Ukraine’s special police
force known as the Berkut was dissolved, as it
had been heavily involved in the violence
against the Euromaidan protestors;
Whereas the Ukrainian government’s use of
force against activists throughout the
Euromaidan protests, including the use of live
bullets, was widely condemned by Western gov-
ernments, including the United States, and ulti-
mately failed to discourage the Euromaidan
movement;
Whereas, on September 1, 2017, the Ukraine–
EU Association Agreement came into force after
its signing by the Government of Ukraine and
the EU;
Whereas, in response to Ukraine’s Revolution
of Dignity, the Russian Federation launched
military aggression against Ukraine, illegally
occupied Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, and in-
stigated a war in eastern Ukraine, which is still
ongoing and has killed more than 10,000 Ukrain-
ians;
Whereas the Russian Federation’s attempted
invasion and annexation of Crimea has been
widely seen as an effort to stifle pro-democracy
developments across Ukraine in 2014 in the wake
of the Revolution of Dignity;
Whereas 2019 marks the 25th anniversary of
the signing of the Budapest Memorandum,
which committed the United States, the United
Kingdom, and the Russian Federation to refrain
from the threat or use of force against Ukraine’s
territorial integrity in exchange for Ukraine giv-
ing up its nuclear weapons;
Whereas the Russian Federation is a signa-
tory to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum and
thus committed to respect the independence,
sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine;
Whereas the Government of the Russian Fed-
eration is further obligated to respect the sov-
ereignty of Ukraine pursuant to its commitments
as a signatory to the Helsinki Final Act and the
Charter of the United Nations;
Whereas, on March 27, 2014, the United Na-
tions General Assembly adopted Resolution 68/
262 calling on states and international organiza-
tions not to recognize any change in Crimea’s
status and affirmed the commitment of the
United Nations to recognize Crimea as part of
Ukraine;
Whereas the United States and European
Union have imposed sanctions on individuals
and entities who have enabled the attempted in-
vasion, annexation, and occupation of Crimea;
Whereas, pursuant to the Revolution of
Dignity’s goal of fighting corruption in Ukraine,
the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted the
Law On the National Anti-Corruption Bureau
(NABU) of Ukraine on October 14, 2014;
Whereas, on June 26, 2018, the Law of
Ukraine On the Establishment of the High Anti-
Corruption Court was signed into law;
Whereas, on July 5, 2018, the Law on National
Security was signed into law, which has
strengthened civilian control over the Ukrainian
military, increased transparency in the security
sector, and more clearly delineated the powers
of law enforcement agencies;
Whereas, on January 6, 2019, the Ecumenical
Patriarch of Constantinople granted
autocephaly to the Ukrainian Orthodox
Church, thus establishing the first independent
Ukrainian Orthodox Church in over 300 years;
Whereas despite requests by the Government
of Ukraine, the Government of the Russian Fed-
eration has repeatedly refused to extradite
former President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych
to stand trial in Ukraine;
Whereas, on January 24, 2019, a Ukrainian
court found Yanukovych guilty in absentia of
high treason and complicity in conducting an
aggressive war against Ukraine, and sentenced
him to 13 years in prison;
Whereas, in order to help Ukraine preserve its
sovereignty in the face of Russian aggression,
the United States Government has provided
Ukraine with over $1,000,000,000 in security as-
sistance, including critical defensive items such
as Javelin anti-tank missiles and Island-class
cutters; and
Whereas, in the 115th Congress, both the
United States Senate and the United States
House of Representatives passed resolutions
commemorating the 85th anniversary of the
Holodomor, the Soviet Union’s manmade famine
that it committed against the people of Ukraine
in 1932 and 1933: Now, therefore, be it

going support of the Ukrainian people for
continued Western integration, political,
economic, and judicial reform, and renewed
anticorruption efforts;
Whereas Volodymyr Zelensky won
Ukraine’s presidential election and was inau-
gurated on May 20, 2019, concluding a peace-
ful transfer of power from former President
Petro Poroshenko; and
Whereas parliamentary elections in
Ukraine are scheduled for July 21, 2019: Now,

The preamble, as amended, was
agreed to.
The resolution (S. Res. 74), as amend-
ed, and its preamble, as amended, was
agreed to as follows:
S. RES. 74
Whereas, on November 21, 2013, peaceful
protests began on Independence Square
(Maidan) in Kyiv against the decision by the
government of then-President Viktor
Yanukovych to suspend signing the Ukraine-
European Union (EU) Association Agreement
and instead pursue closer ties with the Rus-
sian Federation;
Whereas the Maidan protests, initially re-
ferred to as the Euromaidan, quickly drew
thousands of people and broadened to become
a general demonstration in support of
Ukraine’s integration with the European
Union and against the corrupt Yanukovych
regime;
Whereas, on the night of November 30, 2013,
Ukrainian police forces surrounded and vio-
lently dispersed peaceful protestors on the
Maidan;
Whereas the next day, thousands of
Euromaidan demonstrators regrouped and
resumed the protests for three months, de-
spite facing continuing and increasing vio-
lence from the police;
Whereas, on January 16, 2014, anti-protest
laws, known as the dictatorship laws, were
adopted by the Government of Ukraine,
which sought to restrict the actions of the
Euromaidan protestors;
Whereas these laws were condemned by
Euromaidan protestors as well as Western of-
ficials, including then-Secretary of State
John Kerry, who called them anti-demo-
cratic;
Whereas many of these laws were repealed
just 11 days after being signed into law;
Whereas, on the night of February 18, 2014,
police assaulted and burned down the Trade
Union Building in Kyiv, which had been used
as a headquarters for the Euromaidan move-
ment;
Whereas Yanukovych’s government forces
began using live ammunition against the
Euromaidan movement, leading to the
deaths of more than a hundred protestors
who are now remembered in Ukraine as the
Heavenly Hundred;
Whereas, on February 21, 2014, in the face
of the ongoing Euromaidan protests demand-
ing his resignation, then-President Viktor
Yanukovych fled Kyiv, and then fled Ukraine
the next day;
Whereas, on February 22, 2014, the
Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine recognized that
Yanukovych had ceased his functions as
president, voted him from office, and sched-
uled early presidential elections for May 25,
2014;
Whereas, on February 25, 2014, fulfilling de-
mands of the Maidan, Ukraine’s special po-
lice force known as the Berkut was dis-
solved, as it had been heavily involved in the
violence against the Euromaidan protestors;
Whereas the Ukrainian government’s use
of force against activists throughout the
Euromaidan protests, including the use of
live bullets, was widely condemned by West-
ern governments, including the United
States, and ultimately failed to discourage
the Euromaidan movement;
Whereas, on September 1, 2017, the
Ukraine-EU Association Agreement came
into force after its signing by the Govern-
ment of Ukraine and the EU;
Whereas, in response to Ukraine’s Revolu-
tion of Dignity, the Russian Federation
launched military aggression against
Ukraine, illegally occupied Ukraine’s Cri-
mean Peninsula, and instigated a war in
eastern Ukraine, which is still ongoing and
has killed more than 10,000 Ukrainians;
Whereas the Russian Federation’s at-
tempted invasion and annexation of Crimea
has been widely seen as an effort to stifle
pro-democracy developments across Ukraine
in 2014 in the wake of the Revolution of Dig-
nity;
Whereas 2019 marks the 25th anniversary of
the signing of the Budapest Memorandum,
which committed the United States, the
United Kingdom, and the Russian Federation
to refrain from the threat or use of force
against Ukraine’s territorial integrity in ex-
change for Ukraine giving up its nuclear
weapons;
Whereas the Russian Federation is a signa-
tory to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum and
thus committed to respect the independence,
sovereignty, and territorial integrity of
Ukraine;
Whereas the Government of the Russian
Federation is further obligated to respect
the sovereignty of Ukraine pursuant to its
commitments as a signatory to the Helsinki
Final Act and the Charter of the United Na-
tions;
Whereas, on March 27, 2014, the United Na-
tions General Assembly adopted Resolution
68/262 calling on states and international or-
ganizations not to recognize any change in
Crimea’s status and affirmed the commit-
ment of the United Nations to recognize Cri-
mea as part of Ukraine;
Whereas the United States and European
Union have imposed sanctions on individuals
and entities who have enabled the attempted
invasion, annexation, and occupation of Cri-
mea;
Whereas, pursuant to the Revolution of
Dignity’s goal of fighting corruption in
Ukraine, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine
adopted the Law On the National Anti-Cor-
ruption Bureau (NABU) of Ukraine on Octo-
ber 14, 2014;
Whereas, on June 26, 2018, the Law of
Ukraine On the Establishment of the High
Anti-Corruption Court was signed into law;
Whereas, on July 5, 2018, the Law on Na-
tional Security was signed into law, which
has strengthened civilian control over the
Ukrainian military, increased transparency
in the security sector, and more clearly de-
lineated the powers of law enforcement agen-
cies;
Whereas, on January 6, 2019, the Ecumeni-
cal Patriarch of Constantinople granted
autocephaly to the Ukrainian Orthodox
Church, thus establishing the first inde-
pendent Ukrainian Orthodox Church in over
300 years;
Whereas despite requests by the Govern-
ment of Ukraine, the Government of the
Russian Federation has repeatedly refused to
extradite former President of Ukraine
Viktor Yanukovych to stand trial in
Ukraine;
Whereas, on January 24, 2019, a Ukrainian
court found Yanukovych guilty in absentia
of high treason and complicity in conducting
an aggressive war against Ukraine, and sen-
tenced him to 13 years in prison;
Whereas, in order to help Ukraine preserve
its sovereignty in the face of Russian aggres-
sion, the United States Government has pro-
vided Ukraine with over $1,000,000,000 in se-
curity assistance, including critical defen-
sive items such as Javelin anti-tank missiles
and Island-class cutters;
Whereas, in the 115th Congress, both the
United States Senate and the United States
House of Representatives passed resolutions
commemorating the 85th anniversary of the
Holodomor, the Soviet Union’s manmade
famine that it committed against the people
of Ukraine in 1932 and 1933;
Whereas, on March 31, 2019 and April 21,
2019, Ukraine held the first and second
rounds of its presidential election;
Whereas these elections were widely recog-
nized by international observers as being
free, fair, and conducted without serious,
widespread irregularities;
Whereas the large turnout and civic activ-
ism related to the election highlight the on-
going support of the Ukrainian people for
continued Western integration, political,
economic, and judicial reform, and renewed
anticorruption efforts;
Whereas Volodymyr Zelensky won
Ukraine’s presidential election and was inau-
gurated on May 20, 2019, concluding a peace-
ful transfer of power from former President
Petro Poroshenko; and
Whereas parliamentary elections in
Ukraine are scheduled for July 21, 2019: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) remembers the courage and resolve
shown by the Ukrainian people in the Revo-
lution of Dignity;
(2) solemnly honors the ‘‘Heavenly Hun-
dred’’ who were killed during the Revolution
of Dignity while fighting for the causes of
freedom and democracy in Ukraine;
(3) applauds the progress that the Govern-
ment of Ukraine has made since the Revolu-
tion of Dignity in strengthening the rule of
law, aligning itself with Euro-Atlantic
norms and standards, and improving mili-

(NATO);
(4) encourages the Government of Ukraine
to continue implementing crucial reforms to
fight corruption, build strong and free mar-
kets, and strengthen democracy and the rule
of law;
(5) affirms the United States Government’s
unwavering commitment to supporting the
continuing efforts of the Government of
Ukraine to implement democratic and free
market reforms, restoring Ukraine’s terri-
torial integrity, as well as providing addi-
tional lethal and non-lethal security assist-
ance to strengthen Ukraine’s defense capa-
bilities on land, sea, and in the air in order

CONDEMNING BRUNEI’S DRAMATIC
HUMAN RIGHTS BACKSLIDING
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the Senate
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 139, S. Res. 198.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the resolution by
title.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read as follows:
A resolution (S. Res. 198) condemning
Brunei’s dramatic human rights backsliding.
There being no objection, the Senate
proceeded to consider the resolution,
which had been reported from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, with an
amendment to strike all after the re-
solving clause and insert the part
printed in italic, and with an amend-
ment to strike the preamble and insert
the part printed in italic, as follows:
Whereas Brunei has been led since 1967 by one
of the world’s longest-reigning monarchs, Sul-
tan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah;
Whereas Brunei gained independence in 1984;
Whereas emergency powers in place in Brunei
since 1962 allow the sultan to govern with few
limitations to his authority;
Whereas, according to the United States De-
partment of State 2018 Human Rights Report,
human rights issues in Brunei included censor-
ship, interferences with the rights of peaceful
assembly and freedom of association, crimes in-
volving violence or threats targeting homosex-
uality, and exploitation of foreign workers, in-
cluding through forced labor;
Whereas Brunei’s media are neither free nor
diverse, with broadcasting dominated by the
state and private media owned or controlled by
the royal family;
Whereas homosexuality has been illegal in
Brunei, carrying a punishment of up to ten
years in prison;
Whereas in 2013, the Government of Brunei
announced it was imposing a revised penal code
that included harsher punishments of death by
stoning for adultery and homosexual relations;
Whereas international condemnation resulted
in a delay in carrying out the provisions;
Whereas, in March 2019, the Government of
Brunei announced it was going forward with
the penal code to take effect April 3, 2019;
Whereas the penal code includes, among other
things, death by stoning for male same-sex rela-
tions, adultery, and blasphemy, amputation of
limbs for theft, whipping for female same-sex re-
lations, and criminalization of exposure of chil-
dren to the beliefs and practices of differing reli-
gions;
Whereas, on April 2, 2019, the Department of
State said Brunei’s new penal code and associ-
ated penalties run ‘‘counter to its international
human rights obligations including with respect
to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment’’;
Whereas, on April 18, 2019, the European Par-
liament adopted a resolution strongly con-
demning Brunei for introducing ‘‘retrograde’’
laws, calling for their immediate repeal, urging
that Brunei uphold its international obligations
under ‘‘international human rights instruments,
including with regard to sexual minorities, reli-
gious minorities and non-believers,’’ and sug-
gesting visa bans and asset freezes should the
penal code not be repealed;
Whereas the United Nations and international
human rights organizations have denounced the
penal code, arguing it amounts to torture and a
violation of human rights;
Whereas United Nations High Commissioner
for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet urged
Brunei to repeal the penal code, noting the pun-
ishments proscribed as ‘‘cruel, inhuman, and de-
grading’’ and calling the code a ‘‘serious set-
back for human rights protections’’;
Whereas Human Rights Watch stated,
‘‘Brunei’s new penal code is barbaric to the
core, imposing archaic punishments for acts
that shouldn’t even be crimes. . . . Sultan
Hassanal should immediately suspend amputa-
tions, stoning, and all other rights-abusing pro-
visions and punishments.’’;
Whereas Amnesty International stated,
‘‘Brunei’s Penal Code is a deeply flawed piece of
legislation containing a range of provisions that
violate human rights. . . . As well as imposing
cruel, inhuman and degrading punishments, it
blatantly restricts the rights to freedom of ex-
pression, religion and belief, and codifies dis-
crimination against women and girls.’’; and
Whereas the Joint United Nations Program on
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) Executive Director Michel
Sidibé stated that the implementation of this
discriminatory penal code will ‘‘drive people un-
derground and out of reach of life-saving HIV
treatment and prevention services,’’ and
UNAIDS and the United Nations Population
Fund noted these kinds of laws ‘‘increase stig-
ma, and give license to discrimination, violence,
and harassment’’: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) condemns the Government of Brunei’s fur-
ther criminalization and barbaric punishments
regarding sexual orientation, adultery, and re-
lations between persons of the same sex;
(2) calls on the Government of Brunei to expe-
ditiously repeal the 2013 penal code; and
(3) supports the withdrawal and denial of
United States visas for any Brunei official re-
sponsible for passage or implementation of such
penal code and related laws until they are re-
pealed.
Mr. THUNE. I further ask that the
committee-reported substitute amend-
ment to the resolution be agreed to;
that the resolution, as amended, be
agreed to; that the committee-reported
amendment to the preamble be agreed
to; that the preamble, as amended, be
agreed to; and that the motions to re-
consider be considered made and laid
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
The committee-reported amendment,
in the nature of a substitute, was
agreed to.
The resolution, as amended, was
agreed to.
The committee-reported amendment
to the preamble was agreed to.
The preamble, as amended, was
agreed to.
The resolution (S. Res. 198), as
amended, and the preamble, as amend-
ed, were agreed to.

MEASURE READ THE FIRST
TIME—H.R. 1327
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I un-
derstand there is a bill at the desk, and
I ask for its first reading.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The

the first time.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read as follows:
A bill (H.R. 1327) to extend authorization
for the September 11th Victim Compensation
Fund of 2001 through fiscal year 2092, and for
other purposes.
Mr. THUNE. I now ask for a second

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The bill will receive a second reading
on the next legislative day.

RECOGNIZING RANGER DOUG
FOLLETT OF WHITEFISH
HON. GREG GIANFORTE
OF MONTANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 16, 2019
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Seasonal Interpretive Ranger
Doug Follett of Whitefish for guiding countless
visitors through Glacier National Park, one of
our nation’s natural wonders, for 70 years.
Ranger Doug has spent decades in and
around Glacier National Park. His family
moved to Whitefish, Montana when he was a
toddler, and he’s made the area his home
ever since. Before working at Glacier National
Park, he worked for the railroad and served
the United States in the Air Force during
World War II. He began working seasonally in
Glacier National Park during the summer while
he taught high school history in the winter.
Ranger Doug has spent 58 seasons as an
interpretive ranger in Glacier National Park,
making him one of the longest-serving em-
ployees of the National Park Service. He has
led thousands of visitors through trails in the
park’s expansive forests and beautiful glacier-
carved mountains and valleys.
Ranger Doug greets visitors with a fist bump
and is known for reciting his original poetry
dedicated to the park. An ambassador of Gla-
cier National Park, he shares his knowledge
and experience with the thousands of visitors
he guides each year. Those who cross Rang-
er Doug’s path each season walk away from
Glacier with his infectious passion and enthu-
siasm for the park.
A well-known figure in Glacier National Park
and in the community, Ranger Doug has no
plans to slow down and retire anytime soon,
saying, ‘‘I’ll never know until it’s over.’’
Many more stories and experiences will
come from those who cross paths with Ranger
Doug.
Madam Speaker, for serving 70 years as an
ambassador of Glacier National Park and
Montana to the millions of visitors who visit the
park each year, I recognize Ranger Doug
Follett for his spirit of Montana.

HONORING ADMIRAL MANFRED
NIELSON FOR HIS SERVICE
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 16, 2019
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor and recognize Admiral Manfred Nielson
for his service as Deputy Supreme Allied
Commander Transformation at NATO’s head-
quarters in Norfolk, VA.
Admiral Nielson, German Navy, took over
responsibilities as Deputy Supreme Allied
Commander Transformation at Norfolk, Vir-
ginia, in 2016.
In this critical role at NATO’s only strategic
headquarters in North America, Admiral Niel-
son promoted and advanced his headquarters’
role in innovating and developing the alliance’s
transformational approaches in future warfare.
He increased the collaboration between pri-
vate companies and the public sector to accel-
erate the pace of discovery. He expanded
NATO’s outreach to academic institutions to
build networks, improve decision-making sim-
ulations, and increase engagement with the
next generation of thinkers and leaders. He
has been a strong and active supporter of the
NATO Model Challenge where NATO is intro-
duced to local students in an annual con-
ference.
Admiral Nielson often emphasized the need
for close cooperation with the U.S. as an open
and generous host nation. He always stressed
his gratitude for the incredible welcome he re-
ceived throughout the U.S. He constantly con-
nected and liaised with American officials to
deepen our work with NATO.
He put enormous efforts in strengthening
ties to the local community through events and
activities, as well as constant communication
and information exchange. Because of him,
relationships with several local universities and
think tanks are excellent. He also enjoyed and
promoted the cultural life in Norfolk by hosting
various events to show German hospitality
and promote the U.S.-German partnership. He
always promoted the special relationship be-
tween the U.S. and Germany based on com-
mon shared values.
In return, I acknowledge that the United
States owes our gratitude to this outstanding
officer for his generous spirit, keen insight,
and tremendous partnership. I wish Admiral
Nielson the best as he concludes his tour as
Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Trans-
formation and returns to Germany.

IN RECOGNITION OF DOUG

HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 16, 2019
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to
recognize Doug Walker who has retired from
his career in broadcast journalism after 43
years. Doug has served the people of south
Mississippi at the WLOX news station for 30
years and has many notable accomplishments
under his belt from his tenure with the station.
In 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall on
the Mississippi Gulf Coast, causing mass
amounts of devastation throughout south Mis-
sissippi. Doug and the WLOX team remained
on the ground and on air during the storm so
they could continue providing critical updates
to south Mississippi. Because of this impec-
cable journalism, Doug and others at WLOX
received the distinguished Peabody Award in
2006. This award recognizes broadcasting ex-
cellence in both news and entertainment.
Without the coverage provided by Doug and
the WLOX team, south Mississippi would not
have received widespread updates before,
during, and after the storm. We are grateful to
have hap these individuals remain engaged on
delivering coverage of the hUrricane and our
recovery.
A year after Hurricane Katrina, Doug re-
ceived a personal invitation to the White
House for a one-on-one interview with Presi-
dent George W. Bush. During their discussion,
Doug and President Bush reflected through
the events that unfolded after the storm
passed, both recalling the utter devastation
the storm brought to Mississippi. Doug has re-
counted this invitation and interview as the
highlight of his broadcasting career.
Furthermore, Doug exemplifies the ‘‘never
quit mentality’’ that is embodied by so many
along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Doug was di-
agnosed with kidney cancer in late 2006. Al-
though that news may be defeating for some,
Doug did not let it defeat his spirit. After many
surgeries, Doug was cleared of his cancer and
eventually returned back to his passion.
I have personally enjoyed working with
Doug over the years, most often on the WLOX
News this Week segment. I know he will be
sorely missed on WLOX by many in south
Mississippi.
I am pleased to recognize Doug for his
many accomplishments over the years and
wish him a very relaxing and well-deserved re-
tirement.

ENDING THE KREMLIN’S
SUBVERSION CAMPAIGNS
HON. ADAM KINZINGER
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 16, 2019
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, earlier
this month, I gave opening remarks with my
esteemed colleagues Sen. WHITEHOUSE (D–
RI), Rep. KEATING (D–MA) and Rep. ROONEY
(R–FL) at an event hosted by the Free Russia
Foundation discussing the Kremlin’s disturbing
and significant attacks on Western institutions.
During the event, the Free Russia Founda-
tion released a report, which can be found at
https://www.4freerussia.orglwp-content/
uploads/2019/06/misruleoflaw-web-pages.pdf,
demonstrating how the Kremlin’s active meas-
ures and subversion campaigns infiltrate
Western institutions to undermine the rule of
law. The power of this report comes from spe-
cific instances of Russian influence and cor-
rupt practices aimed at the United States and
European Union. This includes a Kremlin-di-
rected effort to pass legislation in European
parliaments to effectively nullify the Yukos
shareholder court decisions, to the benefit of
the Russian Federation.
I encourage others to produce thoughtful re-
search documenting Russian abuses of the
rule of law. I am glad a light is being shown
on these cases, but I know other instances of
abuse continue unabated within Russia. As a
nation, we must stand up to Putin’s disregard
for the international rule of law and ensure
that the world is a safe place to live and con-
duct business.
I encourage Congress to continue to hold
hearings on Russia’s malign influence cam-
paigns so the United States can defend our in-
stitutions from manipulation and misuse by the
Russians.

Tuesday, July 16, 2019
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor and celebrate the 100th birthday of Bill
Wills of Virginia Beach. Bill served our nation
faithfully with ‘‘The Big Red One,’’ a combined
arms division in the U.S. Army, and is a sur-
vivor of the D–Day Normandy landing. Before
the D–Day landing, he traveled all over the
world and made landings in Africa and in Sic-
ily. After returning from the war, Bill joined the
New York City Police Department. He served
many years with the mounted police and then
retired in Virginia Beach with his wife of 65
years.
Bill Wills’ courageous dedication to his
country, community, and family brings great
honor to our district. I am proud to recognize
his health and the many years of wisdom he
has offered our community and America.

HONORING LIEUTENANT COLONEL
AND MRS. JUDDSON FLORIS ON
THEIR RETIREMENT FROM THE
ARMY
HON. DEAN PHILLIPS
OF MINNESOTA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 16, 2019
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I’m hon-
ored today to recognize two of America’s best,
Lieutenant Colonel Juddson Floris, United
States Army, and his wife, Rebecca, for their
extraordinary selfless service to our Nation.
Lieutenant Colonel Floris will soon retire from
the Army after a long and distinguished ca-
reer.
A native of Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Judd
has distinguished himself as a true leader of
character both at work and at home. Lieuten-
ant Colonel Floris began his Army career as a
plebe at the United States Military Academy at
West Point in 1995, and, upon graduation
from West Point, he was commissioned as a
Second Lieutenant in the Infantry Branch in
1999.
Upon graduating from the Infantry Officers
Basic Course, Lieutenant Colonel Floris was
assigned to 2nd Battalion, 325th Airborne In-
fantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division at
Fort Bragg, North Carolina where he served
as an Airborne Rifle Platoon Leader, Company
Executive Officer, and Battalion Air Operations
Officer. However, Judd always dreamed of
something different, and he decided to apply
for and attend Special Forces Assessment
and Selection to begin the long journey of be-
coming a Green Beret.
After completing the Special Forces Quali-
fication Course and earning his ‘‘long tab,’’
Lieutenant Colonel Floris was assigned to the
1st Special Forces Group (Airborne) Com-
mander’s In-Extremis Force in Okinawa,
Japan as a Special Forces Operational De-
tachment—Alpha Commander, Assault Force
Commander, Company Executive Officer, and
Company Commander. Lieutenant Colonel
Floris was then assigned to the Pentagon as
an Operations Officer in the joint Staff J–3 and
the Army G–3 Special Operations Division. He
then returned to 1st Special Forces Group
(Airborne) where he commanded a Special
Forces Company and Task Force, and subse-
quently served as an Operations Officer at the
Battalion, joint Special Operations Task Force,
and Group levels. Lieutenant Colonel Floris
most recently served as a Special Operations
and Counter-Terrorism Policy Advisor to the
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Op-
erations and Low Intensity Conflict in the Pen-
tagon.
Lieutenant Colonel Floris has deployed fif-
teen times in support of named operations and
Theater Campaign Plan events in the Middle
East and Pacific areas of operations.
His awards and decorations include the Le-
gion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal with one
Oak Leaf Cluster, the Defense Meritorious
Service Medal with one Oak Leaf Cluster, the
Meritorious Service Medal with two Oak Leaf
Clusters, the Joint Service Commendation
Medal with one Oak Leaf Cluster, the Combat
and Expert Infantryman’s Badges, the Special
Forces and Ranger Tabs, Master Parachutist
Badge, Military Free Fall Badge, Pathfinder
Badge, Air Assault Badge, and the Staff Iden-
tification Badges from the Office of the Sec-
retary of Defense, the Joint Staff, and the
Army Staff. Lieutenant Colonel Floris also
holds parachutist’s badges from seven coun-
tries.
Judd earned a Bachelor of Science Degree
in Systems Engineering (Distinguished Grad-
uate) from West Point and a Master of Arts
Degree in Policy Management from George-
town University.
But the accolades, awards, degrees, and
badges don’t tell the full story. They don’t tell
you how superiors, peers, and subordinates
alike respect and revere Judd, not just for his
military prowess, but for the care, compassion
and empathy which he brought to every situa-
tion. They don’t give insight into the selfless-
ness shown by Judd and Rebecca to the sol-
diers and families under Judd’s command.
And they certainly don’t tell the full story of
twenty years of sacrifice, which the Floris fam-
ily has endured as a result of fifteen deploy-
ments away from home.
So, on this day and on behalf of a grateful
Nation, it is my honor to recognize the selfless
service and sacrifice of Lieutenant Colonel
Juddson Floris, his wife, Rebecca, and sons,
Callum and Max. I wish them the very best as
they begin this new chapter of their lives.

TEMPLE AARON ANNIVERSARY
HON. KEN BUCK
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 16, 2019
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the 130th anniversary of Temple
Aaron located in Trinidad, Colorado.
Temple Aaron was constructed in 1889 and
is one of less than two dozen synagogues still
standing that were constructed in the 19th
Century. The temple is the oldest continuously
operating Jewish synagogue west of the Mis-
sissippi River and has been recognized by
major historical preservation organizations as
being of tremendous importance to the state.
Additionally, I would like to extend post-
humous recognition to Kathryn and Leon
Rubin, and their two sons, Randy and Ron, for
their 30 years of dedicated service and care to
Temple Aaron. In 1985, the Rubin family took
the primary leadership role in supporting the
temple, managing its congregation, and main-
taining the building’s infrastructure—which in-
cluded preserving the temple’s historic stained
glass windows. The Rubins also organized
fundraising events and submitted grant appli-
cations in an effort to keep Temple Aaron’s
doors open.

RECOGNIZING SERGEANT MAJOR
DANIEL A. DAILEY
HON. JOHN R. CARTER
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 16, 2019
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I’m honored to recognize the fifteenth Ser-
geant Major of the Army, Sergeant Major Dan-
iel A. Dailey, for his extraordinary service to
our Nation. Sergeant Major of the Army Dailey
will soon relinquish his responsibilities as the
United States Army’s Senior Enlisted Leader
and will then retire from the Army after a long
and distinguished career.
A native of Palmerton, Pennsylvania, SMA
Dailey enlisted in the Army in 1989 and at-
tended Basic Training and Advanced Indi-
vidual Training as an Infantryman at Fort
Benning, Georgia. During his career, SMA
Dailey has held every enlisted leadership posi-
tion within mechanized infantry branch, rang-
ing from Bradley Fighting Vehicle Commander
to his current role.
SMA Dailey was sworn in as the 15th Ser-
geant Major of the Army on January 30, 2015.
In this demanding role , Sergeant Major Dailey
is the Army Chief of Staff’s adviser on all mat-
ters affecting the enlisted force. He tirelessly
devotes much of his time traveling throughout
the Army to observe training and talk with Sol-
diers and their Families. He represents the
U.S. Army on a variety of councils and boards
that make decisions affecting enlisted Soldiers
and their Families. Known for understanding
the ground truth at the Soldier level he is rou-
tinely invited to testify before Congress to pro-
vide his unique perspective. SMA Dailey is the
public face of the U.S. Army’s Noncommis-
sioned Officer Corps, representing the Corps
to the American people in the media and
through business and community engage-
ments.
Sergeant Major of the Army Dailey is a shin-
ing example of Army Values and embodies
the Noncommissioned Officer’s Creed. Com-
petence is indeed Sergeant Major Dailey’s
watchword, and his commitment to doing what
good NCOs do, accomplishing the mission
taking care of his teammates, is unparalleled.
It has been a pleasure to know and serve
with Sergeant Major Dailey during his time as
the Sergeant Major of the Army. On behalf of
a grateful Nation, it is my honor to recognize
the selfless service and sacrifice of Sergeant
Major of the Army Dailey and his family. I wish
him the very best as he begins this new chap-
ter of his life.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA FEDERAL OFFI-
CIALS RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT
EQUALITY ACT
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 16, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Federal Offi-
cials Residency Requirement Equality Act,
which would amend federal law to require cer-
tain federal officials who serve the District of
Columbia to actually live within its boundaries.
In nearly every other jurisdiction in the United
States, federal district court judges, federal cir-
cuit court judges, U.S. Attorneys and U.S.
Marshals are required by federal law to reside
within the jurisdictions where they have been
appointed—but these same officials appointed
to serve only the people of the District are not
bound by these same requirements. Even in
the territories, such officials are required to
live in those districts, other than the U.S. At-
torney and U.S. Marshal appointed for the
Northern Mariana Islands who at the same
time are serving in the same capacity in an-
other district. The only other exceptions exist
for such officials appointed to the Southern
District of New York and the Eastern District of
New York, which are the only districts that
serve different parts of the same city. My bill
would put the District on equal footing with al-
most every other jurisdiction by ensuring that
our judges, U.S. Marshals and U.S. Attorney
live among the residents they have been ap-
pointed to represent, in keeping with the fed-
eral law that applies elsewhere in the United
States.
The requirement that these federal officials
ought to live in the jurisdictions they serve is
significantly related to knowledge of the effect
of their decisions, an important reason the
residency requirement is enshrined in federal
law. As stated in the official commentary to
the Code of Conduct for United States
Judges, ‘‘a judge should not become isolated
from the society in which the judge lives.’’ The
same holds true for other federal officials. My
bill recognizes that the District deserves fed-
eral officials with the same understanding and
links to the community as Congress has seen
fit to require for federal officials in other juris-
dictions.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

CORPSMAN MARCUS ALLEN
KENNEDY
HON. DONALD NORCROSS

Tuesday, July 16, 2019
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor United States Navy Veteran,
Hospital Corpsman Marcus Allen Kennedy of
Clementon in Camden County located in New
Jersey’s First Congressional District.
On February 22, 2011, Corpsman Kennedy
began basic training at Great Lakes, Chicago.
He then traveled to San Antonio, Texas where
he trained and served as a medical assistant
and EMT. Afterwards, he trained for an addi-
tional three months at Camp Johnson, North
Carolina.
His first station took place at Fort Smith
Navy Hospital in Virginia where he worked in
the medical and surgery ward where he as-
sisted nurses, administered medicine, and
transported patients. After his station in Vir-
ginia, Corpsman Kennedy was nominated to
sail on the USS George H.W. Bush.
In 2013, he was transferred to Camp Pen-
dleton in California where he provided the 2nd
Battalion, 1st Marine regime with medical
care. Corpsman Kennedy was deployed on
the 11th Marine Expedition Unit and was on
call for the Western Pacific. During his sailing
he furthered his training in the military in Ma-
laysia and Kuwait.
Following his deployment, Corpsman Ken-
nedy returned to California for his certification
in phlebotomy and medical assistance. In
2016, he moved to Pennsylvania to work for
the American Red Cross, followed by Cooper
Hospital. He went on to enroll in school at
Camden County College where he graduated
with an Associate’s Degree in Human Serv-
ices and Addiction Counseling.
Currently, Corpsman Kennedy works for the
Center for Family Services as a recovery spe-
cialist and will be attending Rutgers Univer-
sity–Camden in the fall where he will study so-

RECOGNITION OF MADAM C.J.
WALKER AND RENAMING OF
WEST 136TH STREET BETWEEN
LENOX AVENUE AND ADAM
CLAYTON POWELL BOULEVARD
AS ‘‘MADAM CJ WALKER WAY’’
HON. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 16, 2019
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, Madam
C.J. Walker is the first self-made American fe-
male millionaire and the wealthiest African
American woman of her time as an inventor
and entrepreneur.
Madam C.J. Walker born as Sarah
Breedlove on December 23, 1867 in Louisiana
to Owen and Minerva Anderson Breedlove
was the first of her family born into freedom.
Madam C.J. Walker was orphaned at a
young age. She first married during her ado-
lescent years and became a widow only a few
years later. After the death of her husband
Moses McWilliams, she overcame adversity
and moved to St. Louis, Missouri as a single
mother to her young daughter A’lelia Walker
working as a laundress—barely earning one
dollar a day—she persevered through the
hardships of poverty solely focused on sup-
porting herself and her daughter.
Madam C.J. Walker was determined to
make a better life for her and her daughter
and she was inspired to start her own line of
beauty products. Her inspiration stemmed
from her own struggle as an African American
woman who had difficulty finding hair-care
products that were not only aimed for a spe-
cific hair type, but were also owned by an Afri-
can American woman.
Madam C.J. Walker was an activist and phi-
lanthropist who worked alongside her daughter
A’lelia Walker, leading the vanguard of women
and women of color in the world of business,
philanthropy, advocacy with the National Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of Colored Peo-
ple, the National Negro Business League, and
the National Conference on Lynching, and rich
history and culture of Harlem during the Har-
lem Renaissance.
Madam C.J. Walker dedicated her wealth
and success to better the lives of young Afri-
can-American men and women through schol-
arships for the Young Men’s Christian Asso-
ciation, the Tuskegee Institute, Bethune-
Cookman University, and the Bethel African
Methodist Episcopal Church as a testament to
her fervent belief in furthering African Ameri-
cans as they pursue economic independence
and financial security which continues to pave
the way for African Americans nationwide.
As the Representative of the Thirteenth
Congressional District of New York in the
United States House of Representatives, I am
proud to recognize Madam C.J. Walker for her
inspiration and achievement impact in the Afri-
can American community and celebrate the
renaming of West 136th Street between Lenox
Avenue and Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard
as ‘‘Madam CJ Walker Way’’.

RECOGNIZING COLLEEN O’HARRA
AS THE CONSTITUENT OF THE
MONTH
HON. MIKE LEVIN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 16, 2019
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, I
am honored to recognize Mrs. Colleen
O’Harra, the co-founder of the Oceanside
Women’s Resource Center and a former
member of the Oceanside City Council, as my
Constituent of the Month for July. For 45
years, Colleen and her team have been serv-
ing survivors of domestic violence and their
children at the Women’s Resource Center,
working tirelessly to ensure that community
members receive the services and support
they need to recover.
The Women’s Resource Center opened dur-
ing a time when there was limited to no serv-
ices available for domestic abuse victims, be-
coming the only facility of its kind aiding North
County San Diego families. Under Colleen’s
trailblazing leadership, the Women’s Resource
Center grew from an ‘‘underground’’ network
where domestic abuse survivors received
short-term assistance in private homes, to a
31-bed shelter providing long-term housing,
support, and resources to survivors.
Colleen’s work is imperative as we address
the epidemic of violence against women that
plagues our country. Each year, approximately
12 million adults and over 15 million children
are exposed to domestic violence. These
alarming figures tell us that we must do more
at the local, state, and federal level to em-
power survivors and raise community aware-
ness, ensuring that domestic violence and
sexual assault are neither tolerated nor ac-
cepted in our communities. In April, the House
of Representatives passed the Violence
Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019
(VAWA) with bipartisan support to prevent do-
mestic violence and ensure survivors have re-
sources to recover and seek justice. Today, I
urge my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to help
end the cycle of domestic violence and reau-
thorize the VAWA.
I launched a Constituent of the Month pro-
gram to recognize residents of the 49th Dis-
trict who have gone above and beyond to sup-
port our neighbors and make our community
stronger. After 45 years of providing critical
support services and shelter to survivors in
our community, we owe Colleen a debt of
gratitude, and I am proud to recognize her as
the Constituent of the Month.

IN RECOGNITION OF ROBERT
REIGEL’S KNIGHT OF THE LE-

HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 16, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Robert Reigel for receiving
the Knight of the Legion of Honor Medal from
the people of France for his service during
WWII.
Robert, who recently celebrated his 100th
birthday, enlisted with the U.S. Army in 1943.
He served in four battles overseas during
WWII, which included deployments to France,
England, Italy, and Bavaria. Through his serv-
ice, he earned the Victory Medal, the Euro-
pean-African-Middle Eastern Theater Ribbon
with four Bronze Battle Stars, two Overseas
Service Bars, and a Good Conduct Medal. He
retired from the U.S. Army with a Technician
Fifth Grade rank.
The Knight of the Legion of Honor Medal
was established in 1802 and pays tribute to
soldiers who helped liberate France and West-
ern Europe during WWII. It is the highest mili-
tary distinction given to those who have ac-
complished exceptional deeds for France.
The Hon. Guillaume Lacroix, Consul Gen-
eral of France in Chicago, presented the pres-
tigious award to Robert during a ceremony at
the Wisconsin Veterans Home at King. Sur-
rounded by his family and fellow veterans,
Robert was honored as a hero to both Amer-
ica and France.
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this
body to join me in thanking Mr. Robert Reigel
for his service to our country. His dedication to
our country and his valor in service are truly
an inspiration to us all.

‘‘SENATOR BOB DOLE DAY’’
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 16, 2019
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise
today with the 10th Mountain Division, the
Thousand Island Park Foundation, and the
rest of New York’s 21st District to recognize
the life and service of Senator Robert ‘‘Bob’’
Dole.
In 1942, during the height of World War II,
Senator Dole was stationed with the 10th
Mountain Division. During his deployment to
Italy, he was wounded by machinegun fire and
received a Purple Heart for his courageous
actions.
Senator Dole’s introduction to public office
began in 1950 with the Kansas State House of
Representatives. After serving one term, he
went on to spend the next eight years as the
Russell County State Attorney. In 1960, he ran
successfully for the U.S. House of Represent-
atives where he served for nearly a decade
before running for the U.S. Senate. Senator
Dole served in this capacity for three decades,
holding numerous leadership positions includ-
ing Chair of the Republican National Com-
mittee, Ranking Member of the Senate Agri-
culture Committee, Chair of the Senate Fi-
nance Committee, and Senate Minority Lead-
er.
Senator Dole was immensely respected by
his colleagues on both sides of the isle. He al-
ways negotiated in good faith for the good of
his constituents and served his country honor-
ably his entire career. He continues to inspire
young Americans to serve their country and
pursue public office. I applaud the Jefferson
County Legislature for passing a resolution de-
claring July 20th ‘‘Senator Bob Dole Day’’.
Senator Dole is certainly a deserving recipient
of this recognition and I know that I speak for
all of New York’s 21st District in thanking Sen-
ator Dole for his selfless service to our country
and contribution to our national polity.

SHIRLEY HARTMANN’S 90TH
BIRTHDAY
HON. FRANCIS ROONEY
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 16, 2019
Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to wish a happy birthday on Sep-
tember 1st to Shirley Hartmann on turning 90.
Shirley, a native of New Jersey, now a resi-
dent of Bentley Village with her dog Brando, is
enjoying her retirement. Shirley is a fixture on
the golf course and has even served as the
President of the Ladies 9–Hole Association.
When she isn’t spending her time golfing, she
enjoys playing bocce ball, volunteering at a
local community thrift shop, and catching up
with friends over dinner.
It is my hope that Shirley continues to enjoy
her retirement and putting a smile on every-
one’s face she meets for a long time to come.
Happy Birthday Shirley.
HONORING THE LIFE OF LAQUITA

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 16, 2019
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor and recognize the late LaQuita Brown,
who was senselessly murdered in the Virginia
Beach Municipal Center shooting. Virginia
Beach lost LaQuita far too soon.
LaQuita was a faithful employee and served

Virginia Beach for nearly five years. Friends
described LaQuita as lighting up a room with
her presence. LaQuita spent time traveling to
New York City, Europe, and West Africa.
LaQuita’s life of hard work and service to the
community, as well as her bright spirit, will for-
ever be remembered.
LaQuita will be missed by all her loved
ones. Hampton Roads significantly benefited
from her presence; she made our community

WISHING MR. TOM WILEY A
HAPPY 75TH BIRTHDAY
HON. JOHN JOYCE
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 16, 2019
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Altoona native Tom
Wiley on his 75th Birthday. Tom has spent
more than 15 years in public service pro-
tecting America’s most influential leaders
working for the United States Secret Service.
During his time in the Secret Service, Mr.
Wiley protected Presidents Jimmy Carter,
Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush. He
also was Supervisor of Detail for Vice Presi-
dent Dan Quayle. Wiley was in charge of hos-
pital security after the assassination attempt
on President Reagan in 1981.
During his time in Altoona at Bishop
Guilfoyle, Wiley was an outstanding student
athlete, playing both football and basketball.
He also met his wife, Kathy Urban, while they
were both high school students and they have
been together since. After college at Purdue
University, Wiley returned home to Bishop
Guilfoyle from 1968 to 1971 to teach and
coach.
Wiley has dedicated his life of service to his
country. I ask my colleagues to join me in
wishing Tom Wiley a happy 75th birthday and
thank him for his incredible service to our
country.
HONORING THE 50TH ANNIVER-

PLANT IN MAGNOLIA, ARKANSAS
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN
OF ARKANSAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 16, 2019
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the 50th anniversary of the
operations at the Albemarle Corporation’s
plant in Magnolia, Arkansas.
Albemarle’s Magnolia manufacturing plant is
one the world’s largest suppliers of bromine
and bromine chemicals with forty percent of
the world’s bromine produced at this site. The
chemical ingredients produced at the plant are
used as additives for a wide range of products
manufactured by pharmaceutical companies,
cleaning product manufacturers, water treat-
ment companies, agricultural companies, elec-
tronics goods manufacturers, refineries, and
paper companies.
The plant not only provides good paying
jobs to hundreds of Arkansans throughout the
Fourth District of Arkansas, but it is also a re-
gional steward that sets an example of how a
corporation should be a leader in the commu-
nity.
I take this time to thank Albemarle Corpora-
tion for fifty great years of operating safely, re-
sponsibly, and efficiently, and look forward to
fifty more.

and correspondents, and was printed on a
foot-powered press. Brillion at the time was
largely a German immigrant community. This
presented an issue for the original owners,
who could neither speak nor read the German
language.
In 1899, Otto Zander entered the business.
To the company’s benefit, he could speak
German. Under Otto’s direction, the paper fo-
cused on local news in the greater Brillion
community. Otto published community events,
wedding announcements and obituaries, and
showcased local businesses.
The Brillion News was, and remains, a fam-
ily business. Otto’s son, Elliot, joined the
paper in 1927, operating the Line-O-type ma-
chine and learning skills in editing. In 1944,
Otto passed away, and complete ownership of
the business was transferred to Elliot. Con-
tinuing in the footsteps of his father, Elliot be-
came publisher and editor of The Brillion
News and was later elected president of the
Wisconsin Newspaper Association.
In the early 1960s, Elliot’s children, Zane
and Noel, joined the business, leading to the
incorporation of Zander Press in 1965. Noel
took up sports reporting and covered Brillion
athletics for 33 years. Zane used his skill set
in design to create The Brillion News flag and
Zander Press logo. In 2005, Zander Press,
Inc. was sold to Zane’s four children, passing
the business on to the next generation of the
Zander family.
Today, The Brillion News has a weekly sub-
scription of 2,000 and provides local news to
residents throughout Brown, Calumet, and
Manitowoc counties. Zander Press, Inc. is cur-
rently operated and owned by Beth Wenzel,
Darcy Zander-Feinauer and Kris Bastian.
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to congratu-
late The Brillion News on its 125 years of suc-
cess in business. I wish the Zander family
many more years of continued success.

INTRODUCTION OF THE INSUR-
ANCE ACT—IMPROVING NA-
TIONAL SAFETY BY UPDATING
THE REQUIRED AMOUNT OF IN-
SURANCE NEEDED BY COMMER-
CIAL MOTOR VEHICLES PER
EVENT ACT
HON. JESÚS G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCÍA
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 16, 2019
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I
rise in support of the INSURANCE Act, a bill
introduced today with Representative MATT
CARTWRIGHT to ensure that those who fall vic-
tim to crashes with motor carriers receive the
fair financial compensation they deserve to
cope with their tragedies.
On May 2, 2005, Kate Brown’s 27-year-old
son Graham was hit by an impaired and fa-
tigued truck driver in Round Lake, Illinois. Gra-
ham underwent 22 different surgeries, and
three full years of physical and occupational
therapy. He is now permanently, partially dis-
abled.
Their story is unfortunately an all-too often
occurrence on today’s roads. In fact, since
2007, the U.S. has seen a 41 percent in-
crease in truck crash fatalities; an increase
that was felt by Pam Biddle’s family. In 2017,
Pam’s 23-year-old son, Aaron Lee, was with
his father, Brian, and Brian’s partner, Steph-
anie Swaim in traffic, when they were rear-
ended and pushed into another semi in front
of them. Both vehicles burst into flames killing
Aaron, Brian, and Stephanie. Aaron was close
to receiving his degree from the Purdue
School of Nursing. Brian was a Navy veteran
who served in Operation Desert Storm. Steph-
anie is survived by her five children.
Thousands of families, like Kate’s and
Pam’s, are suffering in silence, saddled with
crippling medical and long-term care costs as-
sociated with catastrophic injuries that come
as a result of crashes with motor carriers and
large trucks.
I am so proud to lead this effort with Rep.
MATT CARTWRIGHT to do better for those who
fall victim to the nightmare of such accidents.
The INSURANCE Act ties the minimum in-
surance required for large trucks or motor car-
riers to inflation of medical costs. For 40
years, since 1980, that minimum requirement
has remained stagnant at $750,000. That min-
imum should be almost 6.5x higher, to ac-
count for today’s inflation of medical costs—a
figure we calculated using the estimated rate
of inflation for medical costs issued by the Bu-
reau of Labor Statistics.
This bill is not asking for anything unreason-
able. Families shouldn’t have to go bankrupt
because a family member died or became se-
verely injured with life-long disabilities as a re-
sult of negligent truck drivers. Big Business
shouldn’t grow profit margins by leaving the
taxpayer’s to foot the bill for medical costs that
families cannot realistically cover.
For these families, we should do better. This
bill is common sense and it is simply the right
thing to do. In fact for families like Kate’s or
Pam’s, it is long overdue.
We urge members to cosponsor the INSUR-
ANCE Act and require that families are ade-
quately compensated for the injuries and fa-
talities caused by motor carrier negligence.

Allie was born August 4, 1927 in Kosciusko,
Mississippi.
Mrs. Jackson confessed Christ at an early
age and joined Wesley United Methodist
Church in Kosciusko, Mississippi and later be-
came a lifelong member of Anderson United
Methodist Church. While at Anderson, she
served as the church pianist, organist, coordi-
nator of the annual Christmas and Easter

She graduated from Piney Woods High
School and received her B.S. degree in Edu-
cation from Jackson State College. She further

versity to specialize in librarianship. Mrs. Jack-
son’s teaching career spanned over 33 years
and included English, band, choir and library
science. After retiring from the Jackson Public
School System, she volunteered at Tougaloo
College in their College Library System where
she received the Volunteer of the Year Award
in 2001.
She leaves to cherish her memory two sib-
lings and three sister-in-laws: Mary Virginia
Ukegbu Kosciusko, Mississippi and Charles
(Faye) Foster, Jackson, Mississippi; Bessie L.
Foster, Kosciusko, Mississippi and Betty Fos-

HONORING THE BRAVERY OF
OFFICER JOSH ROBERTSON
HON. DAVID P. JOYCE
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 16, 2019
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the heroic actions of one of
Painesville’s own, Josh Robertson, a Cleve-
land Heights Police Officer, who selflessly
braved a life-threatening blaze to rescue a 6-
year-old child from a burning home on July 6,
2019.
When Officer Robertson arrived at the
scene of the fire, he encountered a frantic
young mother whose son had been trapped in
the burning house. Without any hesitation, Of-
ficer Robertson jumped into action and
crawled inside to rescue the child, who was
lying unconscious among the flames. Accord-
ing to the Fire Chief, it is unlikely that the boy
would have survived another five minutes. Of-
ficer Robertson’s heroic actions single-
handedly prevented the unspeakable tragedy
of a mother losing her son.
It is stories like these that remind us of the
irreplaceable role that our law enforcement of-
ficers and first responders play in our commu-
nities. I am extremely proud to have such a
courageous officer from Ohio’s Congressional
District 14; Northeast Ohio is lucky to have Of-
ficer Robertson protecting its citizens.
Madam Speaker, please join me in applaud-
ing the bravery and selflessness of Officer
Robertson.
