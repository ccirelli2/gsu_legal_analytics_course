f
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Connecticut (Mr. HIMES) for 5 minutes.
Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle know
that I shy away from sharp partisan-
ship in favor of the negotiation and
compromise required for law to be
made.
I marvel every day at how rarely the
pragmatic common sense of the Amer-
ican people is given voice in this Cham-
ber. But, Mr. Speaker, there are mo-
ments for calculation, for prudence, for
compromise, for the careful weighing
of competing interests, and there are
moments for clarity and conviction.
This is such a moment. The time has
come, Mr. Speaker, for the House of
Representatives to begin an impeach-
ment inquiry into President Trump.
From the moment of his inauguration,
this President has shown contempt for
the truth, has attacked our institu-
tions, and has ignored the Constitution
he swore to defend.
He has refused the oversight which is
Congress’ long-established right and
duty. In recent weeks, he has refused
to comply with subpoenas, he has or-
dered administration officials to refuse
to testify, and he has asserted execu-
tive privilege of unprecedented scope
with respect to attempts to alter the
Census.
That we have not slouched closer to
autocracy is due to the strength of the
democratic safeguards and protections
that we have built and defended for
two-and-a-half centuries. Most Ameri-
cans sense the danger and have re-
acted, most recently, by electing a
House of Representatives with the
power and desire to check this Presi-
dent. The President has persistently
refused to acknowledge or acquiesce to
that power.
Mr. Speaker, the Framers of the Con-
stitution placed the power of impeach-
ment, not in the courts, but in the Con-
gress so that this body might consider
not just the facts and the letter of the
law, but the broader interests of the
Republic. I have, until now, been con-
flicted about those interests.
Impeachment, along with the right
to declare war, is the most awesome
power of the Congress. The politics of
impeachment are messy and uncertain
and might, in the short run, serve the
President’s narrow political interests.
But look at where we are today. Re-
publicans in this Chamber cheer, or
justify, or stand woefully silent in the
face of behavior for which they would
have impeached a Democratic Presi-
dent many times over. Our best and
most proven ideas cannot get even a
hearing in the United States Senate.
Unless we restore respect for the law,
respect for truth, and respect for com-
mon decency, we cannot hope to solve
any of our other pressing problems.
The American people should under-
stand that opening an impeachment in-
quiry is not removal of the President.
Given the behavior of the United
States Senate, that outcome is prob-
ably out of the question. An impeach-
ment inquiry will be a fair consider-
ation of the facts that the American
people must understand with both sides
fairly and openly represented.
Mr. Speaker, I know that I will be
asked if my motive today is to pressure
the Speaker of the House whose leader-
ship of this Congress has been superb.
It is not. She leads us today in the epic
mission of defending our democracy.
That mission requires a vigorous de-
bate and competing ideas, but it also
requires care, discipline, and a measure
of deference.
I represent the people of south-
western Connecticut, the Constitution
State. From my house, I can walk to
the hill where General Israel Putnam
made a daring escape from the British
cavalry in 1779, so that Americans
would never have to answer to a tyrant
for their opinions, politics, or religious
beliefs.
Just up the road is the town of
Ridgefield where General David Woos-
ter and 20 young patriots died in April
of 1777 so that Americans would be
spared ever living under a capricious
and arbitrary power.
Mr. Speaker, there are moments for
careful calculation, for weighing polit-
ical expediency and conflicting inter-
ests, and there are moments for clarity
and conviction. This is that moment.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.

H5042 June 24, 2019
HONORING THE LIFE OF PRIVATE
FIRST CLASS WILLIAM HOOVER
JONES
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD) for 5
minutes.
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker,
yesterday, at World Tabernacle Church
in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, I had
one of the highest honors in my life, to
speak at the funeral service for Private
First Class William Hoover Jones who
served in the Korean war.
He went missing on 26 November 1950.
His remains were recently returned to
U.S. soil by the North Koreans. The fu-
neral service was handled by H.D. Pope
Funeral Home, and he will be interred
at Arlington National Cemetery on Au-
gust 22 of this year with full military
rites.
Mr. Speaker, with your permission, I
will read into the RECORD my remarks
from the funeral:
‘‘As Representative for North Caro-
lina’s First Congressional District,
please allow me to extend official con-
dolences to this family on behalf of the
President and Congress of the United
States of America.
‘‘PFC William Hoover Jones gave his
young life on the battlefield on foreign
soil in defense of our country as part of
the historic 24th Infantry Regiment, a
Black Army regiment first organized in
1869 following the Civil War.
‘‘Private First Class Jones fought on
the front line for the Republic of South
Korea during the Korean war.
‘‘For his service, Private First Class
Jones was promoted to private first
class and posthumously awarded the
Purple Heart, the Combat Infantryman
Badge, the Korean Service Medal, the
National Defense Service Medal, the
Republic of Korean Presidential Unit
Citation, and the Republic of Korea
War Service Medal.
‘‘This Nation is indebted to PFC
Jones for his service to our country
and for offering the highest sacrifice
for freedom. His life.
‘‘PFC Jones was born in Nash County
in 1931 at the beginning of the Great
Depression. Life in Nash County during
that period was Third World. Not only
did African Americans suffer from sec-
ond-class citizenship, but they suffered
from extreme poverty. Undoubtedly,
William Hoover Jones wanted a better
life.
‘‘On 31 May 1950, at the tender age of
18, Hoover enlisted to serve for 3 years
in the Army, recognizing that he would
be deployed to Korea to engage in a
deadly war. I am confident that he vol-
unteered not only to defend our Nation
and our Nation’s interests, but to seek
a better future for himself.
‘‘The record reflects that Private
Jones was poorly trained as an infan-
tryman. History reveals that most
Black soldiers of that era were poorly
trained. Though his training was in-
complete, Private Jones was deployed
to Korea, placed in an all-Black unit,
Company E, 2nd Battalion, 24th Infan-
try Regiment of the 25th Infantry Divi-
sion. President Truman had ordered
that unit integrated in 1948, but as of
1950, integration in the unit had not oc-
curred.
‘‘The Black soldiers of the 24th Infan-
try fought valiantly, but the North Ko-
reans and the Chinese were too fierce
and greatly outnumbered our soldiers.
‘‘The only African American officer
serving the 24th Infantry was Lieuten-
ant Leon Gilbert of York, Pennsyl-
vania. Lieutenant Gilbert led his sol-
diers into fierce battles with the enemy
near the 38th parallel. On 1 September
1950, recognizing that the 24th Infantry
was literally on a suicide mission,
Lieutenant Gilbert ordered his soldiers
off of a deadly hill. The division’s com-
manding officer directed Lieutenant
Gilbert to return his soldiers to the
fight, but he refused.
‘‘Gilbert was court-martialed for his
refusal. He was given a death sentence.
After widespread outrage from Black
Americans, President Harry Truman
commuted the sentence to 20 years of
imprisonment. He served 5 of those 20
years.
‘‘Because of these events, the 24th In-
fantry Regiment was disbanded, but
the division was desperately in need of
infantry soldiers. Therefore, the 24th
Infantry was reactivated and forced
back to the front line. It was there
that PFC Jones went missing on 26 No-
vember 1950 at the age of 19 years old.
‘‘He was recovered by the North Ko-
reans, and his remains have been se-
creted for the past 68 years. They were
returned to American soil just a few
weeks ago. That is the record of PFC
Jones and the story of the 24th Infan-
try Regiment in the Korean war.
‘‘PFC Jones represents a generation
of young African American men who
stood for this country when this coun-
try didn’t stand for them.
‘‘I thank the Department of Defense
for its efforts in recovering and trans-
porting these remains and enabling
this ceremony as we salute an Amer-
ican hero.
‘‘Finally, I pray solace will be found
in knowing that a loved-one’s remains
are home. His soul is in Heaven, and he
died on the battlefield with integrity.
God bless each of the members of his
family.’’
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the op-
portunity to honor and recognize the
life and work of Private First Class
William Hoover Jones.
f
CONCERNS OVER WAIVER
PROCESS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. BERA) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, this Wednes-
day, June 26, marks the 1-year anniver-
sary of the Supreme Court upholding
President Trump’s travel ban which
suspended the issuance of immigrant
and nonimmigrant visas to applicants
from five Muslim-majority countries:
Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and
Yemen; plus Venezuela and North
Korea.
In upholding the travel ban, the
court indicated that by including
North Korea and Venezuela, the admin-
istration was not targeting only Mus-
lim countries. In addition, the adminis-
tration was creating a mechanism by
which foreign nationals from those
banned countries could be issued a
waiver to enter the United States if:
one, the applicant did not represent a
security threat with their entry; or,
two, if denying entry would cause
undue hardship.
One year later, we can evaluate
whether the Trump administration has
honored the court ruling.
Mr. Speaker, from my experience
with my constituents in Sacramento
County, the resounding answer is ‘‘no.’’
In my district, a young girl named
Omnia, who was born in Libya to an
American mother and a Libyan father,
was separated from her family for 2
years because of the travel ban.
Her mother, an American citizen,
took Omnia, who was then 2 years old,
to the immigrant visa interview at the
Embassy in Tunis, where the interview
was only minutes long with no ques-
tions. Instead, the consular officer said
the Embassy had all of the documents
and everything was in order, but they
could not issue the visa for the 2-year-
old. The consular officer told the moth-
er, who was 7 months pregnant at the
time, to go back to the U.S. and have
her baby, and then come back when the
travel ban was over.
The consular office did not reference
the undue hardship exception which
was stipulated in the visa waiver proc-
ess. I don’t believe this 2-year-old was
a security risk and separating a 2-year-
old from their mother clearly causes
undue hardship, so I am not sure what
that process was.
There is also the disturbing case last
year of a Yemeni mother who fought to
obtain a visa waiver to travel to Cali-
fornia to see her terminally ill son. It
was only after widespread media cov-
erage that she was finally granted a
visa waiver to visit the United States
to see her son just days before he
passed away.
This story takes place over and over
again in districts all across this coun-
try. Thus, I have serious concerns
about the waiver process, how it is
being implemented unevenly and with
little guidance, and that waivers grant-
ed are not leading to the issuance of
visas for cleared individuals.
b 1215
My concern is further heightened due
to the cases of constituents in my dis-
trict and across the country who are
being negatively impacted by con-
fusing and uneven processes.
Now, in my role as chairman of the
Subcommittee on Oversight and Inves-
tigations for the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, I am aiming to shed light
on how the visa waiver process is being
implemented. We have asked—and the

June 24, 2019
State Department has not provided in-
formation to us that we have re-
quested—about how to gain a waiver,
what is the process, and what is the
yes/no here.
I think I know why. It is because
there isn’t one, as countless examples
and stories have shown.
We have got to continue to shine a
spotlight on the millions of Americans
whose lives have been thrown into
chaos due to the President’s reckless
and ill thought-through process. I, as
an American, am going to continue to
fight on their behalf.
f
VIOLENCE AGAINST HEALTHCARE
WORKERS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, on
June 11 of this month, the House Edu-
cation and Labor Committee reported
out legislation, H.R. 1309, the Work-
place Violence Prevention for
Healthcare and Social Service Workers
Act. Mr. Speaker, this is a culmination
and a milestone of a 7-year process
that began in 2013.
Like many Members of Congress, I
have been hearing about stories of ris-
ing violence in emergency rooms, am-
bulances, and treatment facilities to
nurses, doctors, and nurses aides that
showed a disturbing trend.
One such case was Helene Andrews, a
registered nurse from Danbury, Con-
necticut, who was assaulted multiple
times during her career. Shortly before
she retired, while she was dispensing
medication to a patient, she was
thrown to the floor and her pelvis was
shattered.
In 2013, former Congressman George
Miller of California and I requested a
report from the Government Account-
ability Office to dig deeper to deter-
mine how pervasive this violence is and
what strategies are at our disposal to
reverse this trend. The report, which
was completed in 2016, found that
workers in healthcare facilities experi-
enced substantially higher rates of
nonfatal injuries due to violence in the
workplace compared to workers over-
all.
Between 2006 and 2016, there was a 70
percent increase in violent incidents
that occurred in healthcare and social
service workplaces that resulted in em-
ployees being away from work. Accord-
ing to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
healthcare and social service workers
are nearly five times more likely to
suffer a serious injury from workplace
violence than workers in other set-
tings.
Up to 30 percent of hospital workers
report being assaulted at work. For
employees in psych hospitals, that
number is drastically higher. Nearly 50
percent of emergency room physicians
have been physically assaulted at
work, and 80 percent report that this
violence affects patient care.
Despite these alarming statistics, we
know that violence against this work-
force is, in fact, grossly underreported.
Many medical professionals are dis-
couraged from reporting incidents, fear
further stigmatizing patients, or are
just told: ‘‘Move on. Shake it off. It is
part of the job.’’
Mr. Speaker, during the course of
work on this legislation, we actually
heard from the Cleveland Clinic in
northeast Ohio, which is one of the
largest healthcare networks in Amer-
ica. The CEO of Cleveland Clinic, Tom
Mihaljevic, gave his 2019 state of the
clinic address, where he described that
there is a national epidemic of violence
against healthcare workers, especially
in emergency room departments. Last
year alone, nearly 30,000 weapons were
confiscated from patients and visitors
in that healthcare network. At the
time we did the markup, one of the
members of our committee actually ex-
pressed disbelief that, in fact, that sta-
tistic was accurate.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD
a letter I supplied to Congresswoman
FOXX at the end of last week citing Mr.
Mihaljevic’s report, which was a
YouTube that is easily found, as well
as an article from Modern Healthcare,
which quoted this amazing and aston-
ishing statistic.
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,
2nd District, CT, June 21, 2019.
Rep. VIRGINIA FOXX,
Ranking Member, Committee on Education
and Labor, Washington, DC.
DEAR RANKING MEMBER FOXX: During our
June 11th mark up of H.R. 1309, the Work-
place Violence Prevention for Health Care
and Social Service Workers Act you ques-
tioned the veracity of a statement I made re-
garding the high number of weapons con-
fiscated from patients and visitors at the
Cleveland Clinic in 2018. The number I cited,
30,000, is indeed alarming. It is also accurate,
and further evidence that health care and so-
cial service workers require enforceable pro-
tections to limit potential violence against
them at their place of work.
During the mark up, you asked publicly
that I verify this statistic, so I would like to
share with you two resources which confirm
that 30,000 weapons were confiscated from
the Cleveland Clinic’s Northeast Ohio facili-
ties in 2018.
In Cleveland Clinic CEO Dr. Tom
Mihaljevic’s 2019 ‘‘State of The Clinic’’ ad-
dress from February 27, 2019, he states:
‘‘there is a national epidemic of violence
against health care workers, especially in
emergency departments . . . last year alone,
nearly 30,000 weapons were confiscated from
patients and visitors.’’ You can view the ad-
dress here: https://www.youtube.com/
watch?v=pOr2UqlNzuY
Additionally, a March 11, 2019 Modern
Healthcare article entitled ‘‘Healthcare
workers face violence ‘epidemic’ ’’ cites Dr.
Mihaljevic’s address and reports that ‘‘In
2018, the clinic confiscated a staggering
30,000 weapons from patients and visitors in
its system in the Northeast Ohio region.’’
The article can be read here: https://
tinyurl.com/y5thhm4r
Given your understandable alarm upon
hearing that the tens of thousands of em-
ployees working at these facilities face daily
exposure to violence, I would welcome your
support of H.R. 1309. As you know, violence
against this workforce is on the rise. Both
Democratic and Republican OSHA Secre-
taries believe an enforceable standard is the
best way to reverse this trend, and this legis-
lation will ensure that happens in a timely
manner.
Thank you,
JOE COURTNEY.
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, it is
obviously not limited just to the State
of Ohio. We know these incidents are
preventable.
Since 1996, OSHA has published vol-
untary guidelines that recommend
commonsense preventative measures
that employers can take to reduce the
risk and severity of violent incidents,
and that is what our bill does. It basi-
cally requires, through OSHA, that
there be a violence prevention plan in
healthcare settings.
It is not one size fits all. It recog-
nizes that some facilities are different
from others. But, in fact, there has to
be a way to train staff to understand
patient risk, to understand ways to de-
escalate violence, and a way to design
workforces to reduce the incidence of
violence.
In addition, it requires that there be
a reporting mechanism to OSHA when
these incidents occur. Today, in a hos-
pital, if there is a slip and fall, it must
be reported; if there is a chemical leak,
it must be reported; but if a nurse is
punched, kicked, or spit at, that is not
required to be reported, and that is
what our bill will do.
The legislation was reported out with
a favorable report. We have 187 cospon-
sors of the legislation. It is bipartisan,
and it will be brought up this summer
for final action.
We have waited far too long to pro-
tect the caregivers, the people in the
caring professions which every Amer-
ican relies on and depends on to be
healed, consoled, and cared for. Yet it
is clear from the GAO report that they
are being subjected to incidents of vio-
lence which, again, are totally unac-
ceptable and which hinder their ability
to do their mission. It is time to pass
H.R. 1309.
Again, I applaud the support from
the emergency room physicians, the
emergency room nurses, and the Amer-
ican Nurses Association, as well as a
host of other groups that are affiliated
with our healthcare delivery system.
Let’s protect the caregivers. Let’s
pass H.R. 1309.

God, Father of us all, we give You
thanks for giving us another day.
Please send Your spirit upon this as-
sembly, that the men and women who
serve the United States in contentious
times such as these might better work
together for the benefit of our Nation.
This is not easy, so bless them with
Your wisdom and give them the pa-

So also we ask Your blessing upon
our world, where so many live and, un-
fortunately, die in nations and regions
cursed by violence and division. We are
mindful, O God, of the descendants of
Abraham in the Middle East. Imbue
them with the grace to see their broth-

HONORING REPRESENTATIVE BILL
PASCRELL
(Ms. SHERRILL asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor our colleague, Rep-
resentative BILL PASCRELL, for whom
the fire headquarters in his hometown
of Paterson, New Jersey, is being
named.
Representative PASCRELL has been a
tireless champion of our country’s fire-
fighters. In 2000, he led the passage of
the FIRE Act, the only Federal pro-
gram to deliver grant funds directly to
local fire departments. In 2015, he
helped secure a $7.5 million grant for
the Paterson Fire Department, which
prevented a dangerous reduction of
forces. He is co-chair of the Congres-
sional Fire Services Caucus.
Just this month, I proudly cast my
vote for Representative PASCRELL’s
amendment to increase funding for the
Firefighter Cancer Registry to ensure
our firefighters can get the care they
need.
As a representative of New Jersey
and as an American, I am grateful for
all the work the Congressman has done
to ensure protection and care for the
brave men and women who put their
lives on the line to keep our commu-
nities safe.
Though I regret I cannot be there
with him this morning in Paterson, I
congratulate Representative PASCRELL
on this well-deserved honor.

OBSERVING ALZHEIMER’S AND
BRAIN AWARENESS MONTH
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, June is Alzheimer’s and Brain
Awareness Month.
As a member of the Congressional
Task Force on Alzheimer’s Disease, I
am grateful to continue supporting
families facing Alzheimer’s. Addition-
ally, I appreciate the BOLD Infrastruc-
ture for Alzheimer’s Act that President
Donald Trump signed into law in De-
cember last year.
Currently, there are more than 5 mil-
lion Americans who live with Alz-
heimer’s, with 16 million family mem-
bers and friends who serve as care-
givers. It is inspiring to know that
313,000 caregivers in South Carolina
provide over 352 million hours of un-
paid care.
South Carolina has extraordinary fa-
cilities to provide exemplary care for
Alzheimer’s patients in a friendly envi-
ronment, including Carroll Campbell
Place of Lexington Medical Center,
honoring our late Governor.
Support and research are provided by
the Alzheimer’s Association Walk to
End Alzheimer’s, with walks held an-
nually in more than 600 communities
nationwide, with Taylor Wilson orga-
nizing the Midlands events.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.

WISHING MARK WILLIAMS GOOD
LUCK IN HIS FUTURE ENDEAVORS
(Mr. CONAWAY asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, it is
with a bittersweet heart today that I
rise to recognize my current chief of
staff, Mark Williams.
Mark will finish 16 years of service
with the House of Representatives and
be moving on to the private sector. He
has been my chief for 41⁄2 years. He
served, faithfully, Todd Rokita, Sam
Johnson, and myself. He is one of those
quiet professionals who makes this
place work.
He is a consummate professional, and
I am a better Member of Congress be-
cause of his wise counsel, his advice,
his hard work, and his dedication to
my team and our team.
I wish he and his wife, Noel; son,
Nolan; and daughter, Katherine all the
best and Godspeed in this next endeav-
or. They will be missed. Although we
won’t see them on a day-to-day basis,
they are still a part of Team Conaway
and also my family.
Mr. Speaker, I wish Mark good luck.
We love him.

Lam to the Capitol. Cindy is the win-
ner of Pennsylvania’s 15th Congres-
sional District Congressional Art Com-
petition.
The annual art competition orga-
nized by the Congressional Institute
showcases the artwork of high school
students from across every congres-
sional district in the country.
Cindy just finished up her sophomore
year at DuBois Area Senior High
School earlier this month. Her artwork
entitled ‘‘Self’’ is a prism-colored pen-
cil drawing.
Cindy’s artwork was selected, by an
independent panel of judges, from 68
entries, which is one of the largest
groups of students to participate in the
15th District’s Congressional Art Com-
petition. All the winning pieces will be
displayed for the year in the Cannon
tunnel, where they will be viewed by
Members of Congress, staff, and many
visitors of the Capitol every day.
Today, Cindy is participating in a re-
ception where she and fellow winners
from across the country will be hon-
ored for their talented work.
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Cindy
and all the students who participated
in the competition.

BOOSTING RATES OF AMERICAN
VETERAN EMPLOYMENT ACT
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I move to
suspend the rules and pass the bill
(H.R. 2109) to amend title 38, United
States Code, to authorize the Secretary
of Veterans Affairs, in awarding a con-
tract for the procurement of goods or
services, to give a preference to
offerors that employ veterans.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 2109
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Boosting
Rates of American Veteran Employment
Act’’ or the ‘‘BRAVE Act’’.
SEC. 2. PREFERENCE FOR OFFERORS EMPLOY-
ING VETERANS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Subchapter II of chapter
81 of title 38, United States Code, is amended
by adding after section 8128 the following
new section:
‘‘§ 8129. Preference for offerors employing
veterans
‘‘(a) PREFERENCE.—In awarding a contract
for the procurement of goods or services, the
Secretary may give a preference to offerors
that employ veterans on a full-time basis.
The Secretary shall determine such pref-
erence based on the percentage of the full-
time employees of the offeror who are vet-
erans.
‘‘(b) ENFORCEMENT PENALTIES FOR MIS-
REPRESENTATION.—(1) Any offeror that is de-
termined by the Secretary to have willfully
and intentionally misrepresented the vet-
eran status of the employees of the offeror
for purposes of subsection (a) may be
debarred from contracting with the Depart-
ment for a period of not less than five years.
‘‘(2) If the Secretary carries out a debar-
ment under paragraph (1), the Secretary
shall commence debarment action against
the offeror by not later than 30 days after de-
termining that the offeror willfully and in-
tentionally misrepresented the veteran sta-
tus of the employees of the offeror as de-
scribed in paragraph (1) and shall complete
debarment actions against such offeror by
not later than 90 days after such determina-
tion.
‘‘(3) The debarment of an offeror under
paragraph (1) includes the debarment of all
principals in the offeror for a period of not
less than five years.’’.
(b) CLERICAL AMENDMENT.—The table of
sections at the beginning of such chapter is
amended by inserting after the item relating
to section 8128 the following new item:
‘‘8129. Preference for offerors employing vet-
erans.’’.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gentle-
woman from American Samoa (Mrs.
RADEWAGEN) each will control 20 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and to
insert extraneous material on H.R.
2109.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
2109, the Boosting Rates of American
Veteran Employment Act, or BRAVE
Act.
We know that overall veterans’ un-
employment rates are below the na-
tional average, and that includes a 3.5
percent rate for our younger post-9/11
veterans. However, this hides an alarm-
ing statistic: nearly one-third of vet-
eran jobseekers are underemployed at a
rate 15.6 percent higher than non-
veteran jobseekers.
Both parties agree that men and
women returning from our most recent
conflicts deserve to come home to a re-
liable, good paying job. We owe them
that.
We can start right here in the Fed-
eral Government. The VA establishes
long-term contracts with private com-
panies for medical equipment, con-
struction supplies, services, and more.
Currently, the VA gives a preference
for these contracts to veteran-owned
small businesses.
The BRAVE Act would expand this
contracting preference to allow the VA
Secretary to give a preference to com-
panies that actively employ veterans, a
policy that would incentivize compa-
nies to hire more veterans, already a
smart approach for companies, because
veterans bring to a job the skills they
earned and learned in their years of in-
valuable military training.
This bipartisan bill would not add
any additional costs or burdens to the
taxpayers. It allows for the debarment
of any company that knowingly mis-
represents its proportion of veteran
employees in order to receive a con-
tracting preference.
The BRAVE Act represents a win-win
for the private sector, the Federal Gov-
ernment, and most importantly, vet-
erans themselves.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Rep-
resentative RICE for her hard work on
this excellent bill, and Ranking Mem-
ber ROE for beginning work on this bill
last Congress. I urge my colleagues to
support it today.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself as much time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 2109, introduced by Representa-
tive RICE of New York.
Mr. Speaker, to improve employment
opportunities for veterans and business
opportunities for the companies that
employ them, H.R. 2109 would author-
ize the Department of Veterans Affairs,
VA, to consider the number of veterans
who would be employed by a potential
contractor and give the company that
employs certain veterans credit for
doing so during the contract approval
process.
The bill would also allow VA to debar
any contractor who willfully and inten-
tionally misrepresents the number of
veterans they employ.
Mr. Speaker, thanks to President
Trump and Republican pro-growth poli-
cies, the veteran unemployment rate is
at a near historic low of 2.7 percent.
I firmly believe that we should en-
courage businesses to provide job op-
portunities to veterans as well as pro-
vide VA with the authority to consider
veteran hires when making contracting
decisions. This legislation emphasizes
that.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative
RICE for her work on this bill, which
has my full support. I urge all my col-
leagues to support H.R. 2109.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5
minutes to the gentlewoman from New
York (Miss RICE), my good friend, who
is a member of the Veterans’ Affairs
Committee and a member of the Sub-
committee on Economic Opportunity,
and the sponsor of H.R. 2109.
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I rise today in support of H.R. 2109, the
Boosting Rates of American Veteran
Employment Act, which I introduced
along with PAUL COOK from California.
The BRAVE Act is commonsense, bi-
partisan legislation that will authorize
the VA Secretary to give preference to
contractors with high concentrations
of full-time veteran employees when
awarding Federal contracts.
First, this bill will reward companies
that actively hire and invest in vet-
erans, companies that seek out vet-
erans and give them opportunities to
bring their unique skills and training

and experience to the civilian work-
force.
Second, it will create an incentive
for other companies to do the same,
which in turn will help bring more vet-
erans into the workforce, and with
good-paying jobs at that, the types of
opportunities that give veterans and
their families the stability they need
as they transition to civilian life.
Most importantly, as more and more
companies hire more and more vet-
erans, they will ultimately see that in-
vesting in veterans is just good for
business. That is what the real incen-
tive should be, not just an advantage in
securing Federal contracts, but getting
the benefit of employees who have
worn the uniform, who have been
trained by the greatest military in the
world, and who have learned to get the
job done no matter what the job is or
how tough it may be.
What business wouldn’t want to have
employees like that?
Lastly, it bears emphasizing that
this bill will cost taxpayers absolutely
nothing.
We need more businesses in the pri-
vate sector to recognize the value of in-
vesting in the men and women who
have served our country.
To be clear, this isn’t an act of char-
ity. Veterans are not looking for a
handout. They just need an oppor-
tunity to show what they can do. That
is what this bill will help accomplish.
The BRAVE Act will help ensure that
more veterans have those opportuni-
ties.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chair-
man TAKANO and Ranking Member ROE
for supporting this bill and for helping
to bring it to the floor today.
This legislation passed unanimously
in the last Congress, and I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to
once again give it the bipartisan sup-
port it deserves.
Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I
am prepared to close, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I urge all
of my colleagues to support the legisla-
tion sponsored by Miss RICE, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
TAKANO) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2109.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

REDUCING CREDIT HOUR REQUIRE-
MENT FOR EDITH NOURSE ROG-
ERS STEM SCHOLARSHIP
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I move to
suspend the rules and pass the bill
(H.R. 2196) to amend title 38, United
States Code, to reduce the credit hour
requirement for the Edith Nourse Rog-
ers STEM Scholarship program of the
Department of Veterans Affairs.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 2196
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. REDUCTION IN CREDIT HOUR RE-
QUIREMENT FOR EDITH NOURSE
ROGERS STEM SCHOLARSHIP.
Section 3320(b)(4)(A)(i) of title 38, United
States Code, is amended by striking ‘‘more
than the standard 128 semester (or 192 quar-
ter) credit hours’’ and inserting ‘‘at least the
standard 120 semester (or 180 quarter) credit
hours’’.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gentle-
woman from American Samoa (Mrs.
RADEWAGEN) each will control 20 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and to
insert extraneous material on H.R.
2196.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
2196, a bill to reduce the credit hour re-
quirement for the Edith Nourse Rogers
STEM Scholarship program.
H.R. 2196 is a technical correction to
the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Schol-
arship, which was codified into law
with the passage of the Harry W.
Colmery Veterans Educational Assist-
ance Act of 2017, also known as the
Forever GI Bill.
This STEM scholarship program,
named after the former chairwoman of
the House Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee, Edith Nourse Rogers, provides
veterans who are enrolled in STEM
programs with additional support if
their GI benefits are exhausted before
they complete an undergraduate de-
gree.
Unfortunately, this much needed
scholarship program is crippled by the
qualification criteria, which neces-
sitates that veterans must be enrolled
in STEM programs that require more
than 128 semester credit hours to grad-
uate.
According to the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs, these criteria only allow
veterans enrolled in three programs at
higher learning institutions to partici-
pate in this great scholarship program.
Now, this was not the intent of the
Congress. H.R. 2196 would correct this
oversight by reducing the required se-
mester credit hours of a degree pro-
gram from 128 to 120, to allow more
programs at a wider array of institu-
tions of higher learning to qualify for
the program.
Now, veterans across the country are
enrolling in Science, Technology, Engi-
neering, and Math based degree pro-
grams at rapid rates, and we should
continue to encourage veterans to pur-
sue STEM programs and employment
in STEM fields.
By continuing to invest in our vet-
erans, we are investing in the Amer-
ican economy and our great Nation.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Rep-
resentative BARR, Representative
LEVIN, and Ranking Member ROE for
their hard work on this excellent bill. I
would especially like to thank Chair-
man LEVIN and the rest of the Eco-
nomic Opportunity Subcommittee for
their bipartisan work to get this bill to
the floor in a timely fashion.
Mr. Speaker, I urge the rest of my
colleagues to support this legislation,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself as much time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 2196. This bill, which is intro-
duced by an outstanding new member
of our committee, Representative BARR
of Kentucky, would clarify the eligi-
bility for the Edith Nourse Rogers
STEM Scholarship program.
This program, enacted as part of the
Forever GI Bill, authorizes extra GI
bill funding to help veterans complete
their undergraduate degrees in a STEM
field.
b 1515
Mr. Speaker, we all know about the
need to fill vacancies for high-paying
jobs in the STEM field. The Smithso-
nian Science Education Center pro-
jected that, in 2018, 2.4 million STEM
jobs went unfilled. This program is
critical to ensure that veterans are the
ones who fill these vacancies. However,
because of the way the law was drafted,
most students are prevented from
using this new benefit due to a tech-
nical glitch that excludes all but a few
STEM programs.
With this program going live on Au-
gust 1, just over a month from now, I
am grateful to Representative BARR for
quickly stepping up to the plate and of-
fering this bill to fix the law’s lan-
guage. Hopefully, with cooperation
from our friends in the Senate, we can
make this change before August.
I encourage all Members to support
H.R. 2196.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR).
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker. I rise today
in support of my bill, H.R. 2196, which
would amend the credit hour require-
ment for the Edith Nourse Rogers
Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Math Scholarship program and the
Forever GI Bill, named after Congress-
woman Edith Nourse Rogers, who
served 18 consecutive terms in Con-
gress and was a tireless advocate for
veterans throughout the 21st century.
This legislation follows the spirit of
this pioneering Congresswoman and en-
sures that our veterans are able to ac-
cess the benefits that they have
earned.

June 24, 2019
Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to qualifying
veterans and Fry Scholars seeking an
undergraduate STEM degree or who
have earned a STEM degree and are
seeking a teaching certification.
Our bill makes a necessary and time-
ly change to the eligibility require-
ment for the Rogers STEM Scholarship
program from 128 required credit hours
to a much more common 120 credit-
hour requirement.
After passage of the Forever GI Bill,
the VA discovered that there were only
three States where the average STEM
degree exceeds 128 required credit
hours, meaning that the vast majority
of veterans would be unable to access
this benefit.
This scholarship is set to launch Au-
gust 1, as was recently said, of this
year, and it is incumbent on Congress
to make this fix before then to ensure
that more student veterans pursuing
STEM degrees are able to utilize the
additional funding Congress provided
for them in the Forever GI Bill.
I would like to thank my colleague,
Congressman LEVIN, for his support in
introducing this bill, as well as Rank-
ing Member ROE and Representative
RADEWAGEN for their cosponsorship as
well.
This is a win-win. There is a labor
supply shortage, especially in critical
STEM fields, and so employers need
STEM-educated workers. At the same
time, there is no better group of people
than veterans who know teamwork,
who know about putting a cause great-
er than themselves, and who, in many
cases, have skills that are particularly
adaptive to the STEM fields where this
is a win for them, as well, in their
movement to civilian life.
I am proud to see this legislation
pass by voice vote in our committee,
and I urge my colleagues to support
this important legislation to ensure we
are setting up our veterans for success
and job security after their service to
our Nation.
Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER).
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Representative RADEWAGEN for yield-
ing to me, and I thank my friend, Mr.
BARR, for his leadership on this impor-
tant issue.
We live in an information-based tech-
nological world. As we look around us,
all our lives are touched by STEM in-
novation. It is the science- and math-
based education that will continue to
shape our country and world and drive
our economy into the next century.
H.R. 2196 is a commonsense, bipar-
tisan fix to give student veterans who
are enrolled in STEM programs more
flexibility to utilize the educational
benefits they earned through their
service.
By allowing student veterans to take
additional credit hours, such as addi-
tional math and science courses, the
Edith Nourse Rogers Scholarship helps
veterans receive a strong STEM edu-
cation, which is essential for suc-
ceeding in technological industries.
As I travel around my district in
Pennsylvania, I consistently hear from
local businesses about the widening
skills gap, and I know these are senti-
ments echoed in districts throughout
the Nation. Our workforce demands
more individuals with a STEM edu-
cation, and who better to have on the
front lines of our evolving global econ-
omy than men and women who bravely
served our country.
We owe it to our student veterans the
ability to pursue a STEM education
and to ensure they have the tools and
resources they need as they transition
back into civilian life. This legislation
takes an important step in doing just
that.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in
the House to vote in support of this
bill.
Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I want to
urge my colleagues to support H.R.

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
further consideration of the bill (H.R.

partments of Commerce and Justice,
Science, and Related Agencies for the

The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The Acting CHAIR. When the Com-
mittee of the Whole rose on Friday,

The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 229 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Chairman, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Strike section 193.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Georgia.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Chairman, if you
had granted me more than 5 minutes, I
would have spent much more of that
time talking about how good it was to
see you there in the chair, but you will
just have to know I am feeling it here,
even though I can’t belabor that point.
I serve on the Transportation Com-
mittee, Mr. Chairman, and my amend-
ment proposes to strike jurisdiction
that belongs to the Transportation
Committee from the appropriations
bill. Now, as you know, clause 2 of the
House Rules prohibits legislating on an
appropriations bill, but the House
Rules Committee waived those rules as
this bill came to the floor, so the only
alternative I have is to come and try to
strike that provision.
The truth is that we have not had a
single hearing on this provision in the
Transportation Committee, Mr. Chair-
man. We have not had a single witness
testify in the Transportation Com-
mittee. We have had bills sitting in the
Transportation Committee that pur-
port to deal with this topic since Janu-
ary and have not called a single bit of
activity directed in this direction, de-
spite having moved a whole host of
bills to the House floor already this
year.
I see that my friends, the chairman
of the Transportation Committee and
the chair of the subcommittee, have
put out a Dear Colleague encouraging
the defeat of this amendment, surren-
dering this jurisdiction of the Trans-
portation Committee to the Appropria-
tions Committee.

Mr. Chairman, there are times that
we do have to legislate on appropria-
tions bills, those times that we can’t
have a functioning authorizing process.
That is not the case with Chairman
DEFAZIO. It is not the case with Chair-
woman HOLMES NORTON, and I cannot
imagine, for the life of me, why this
House would choose to tuck into the
back of an appropriations bill language
that should be heard by the full au-

If we strike this language today, my
commitment is to work with all my
friends in the House to try to move
language forward through the regular
authorizing process and have that back
on the House floor this year.

Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, section 193 simply ensures
that when TIFIA loans are repaid by
local funds, they are treated as part of
the local share of transportation
projects. That sounds like common
sense to me.
Let me address some of the concerns
addressed by my colleague from Geor-
gia.
First, this provision was included in
the bill with the full support of the au-
thorizers, the Transportation and In-
frastructure Committee.
Second, when my colleague was in
the majority, I would remind him there
were no concerns with making perma-
nent authorizing changes on the Trans-
portation appropriations bill, and it did
not matter if a highway reauthoriza-
tion bill was on the horizon.
Third, section 193 is not a significant
departure from current law. Today, the
Department of Transportation may—
may—determine that a TIFIA loan re-
paid from non-Federal funds—that is,
local funding—can be designated as
part of a non-Federal share of Trans-
portation projects costs. This is par-
ticularly important for large, complex
projects, which are seeking to piece to-
gether local, State, and Federal fund-
ing from multiple sources.
The gentleman claims to be con-
cerned about small communities losing
their fair share of Federal capital in-
vestment grant funding, but he should
know that we have appropriated ample
funding for all projects in the grants
pipeline. The bill includes more than
$430 million for smaller projects, which
are often projects in small and midsize
communities, in addition to the $500
million that was appropriated last
year.
To provide greater certainty to
States and local communities, section
193 requires the Department to con-
sider if a TIFIA loan has been repaid by
local funds. That is just common sense.
If a local government is going to use
local revenue to repay a loan, why
wouldn’t that count as a local share?
For an administration that speaks so
often about innovative financing, pub-
lic-private partnerships, and local com-
munities taking on more when it
comes to improving our Nation’s infra-
structure, it makes no sense to dis-
courage State and local governments
from contributing to the overall cost of
a project. I strongly urge my col-
leagues to oppose this amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Chairman, I
would have said in the realm of com-
mon sense that the authorizing com-
mittee should be allowed to authorize.
I would have said the realm of com-
mon sense would have been that, if we
have a committee that is functioning,
we should allow that committee to
function.
I would have said in the realm of
common sense, if the committee chair-
man supports it and the subcommittee
chairman supports it, that perhaps we
should have had a hearing where we at
least talked about it.
I ask, Mr. Chairman, when 80 percent
of the TIFIA money goes to only 10
States, what impact does this have on
smaller States?
b 1530
I would yield to anyone who knows,
but we don’t know because this isn’t
the authorizing committee.
The cardinal is absolutely right: He
provided additional money in CIG dol-
lars this year. But when there are
projects on the horizon that would, by
themselves, as a single project, Mr.
Chair, consume not 1-year’s worth of
funding, not 2-years’ worth of funding,
but 3-years’ worth of funding, leaving
nothing for any other projects in the
Nation, what is the impact of having a
mandatory authorization?
I see my friend, the chairman, at the
desk. I love working with my friend,
the chairman, in the committee. In his
Dear Colleague that he and ELEANOR
HOLMES NORTON sent last year, he
pointed out exactly what I am con-
cerned about today, Mr. Chair. He said:
‘‘As you know, the CIG program’s stat-
utory language is not like a typical
discretionary grant program. . . . It is
a pipeline program where eligible
projects that meet the statutory cri-
teria . . . are funded subject only to
continuing appropriations.’’
The ‘‘may’’ language my friend from
North Carolina cited, rather than
‘‘shall’’ language, is included specifi-
cally because there is no discretion to
prevent the large projects from sucking
all the money out of the funding
stream.
I have that concern, and I would love
to be able to share that concern and
talk about that concern in the com-
mittee of jurisdiction. Again, I commit
to working with any Member who
wants to move such language forward.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I appreciate my colleague’s con-
cern about the committee of jurisdic-
tion, so I am happy to be able to yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO),
the chairman of that committee.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chair, this is a ri-
diculous issue, to put it mildly. This
administration has taken two totally
contradictory positions on this.
Prior to this administration, if you
had a TIFIA loan, you were responsible
for paying it back with local funds. It
was counted as a local match. It is
their obligation. They have to pay it
back. They have to pay the loan fees.
They have to pay for everything that is
involved.
Then, in the first year of this admin-
istration, they said it is local. It
counts as a match.
Oh, wait a minute, a year ago, they
changed their mind. Exactly 1 year
apart: June 29, 2017, TIFIA loans will be
considered a local match; June 29, 2018,
they will not be considered a local
match. They will be considered as Fed-
eral money, ineligible.
What happened in between? I don’t
know. I think it had something to do
with the Portal Bridge in New Jersey
and the Gateway Program, and Presi-
dent Trump being in a dispute with the
Democratic leader of the Senate.
This is about politics, plain and sim-
ple, rotten politics, for critical infra-
structure that this country needs.
If a jurisdiction borrows money—
they borrowed it, they have to pay it
back—that doesn’t count. If they go to
a bank and borrow it and pay higher
interest rates, putting more burden on
local taxpayers, that is okay. But if
they got it from the Feds—by the way,
the Feds make money on TIFIA loans.
It is one of the most amazing pro-
grams. We make money on it. There
has only been like one default in the
history of the program. These are good
loans.
They have to pay it back, so why
wouldn’t it count? Politics, plain and
simple. This is trying to return to poli-
tics, as opposed to common sense, fol-
lowing preexisting practices and the
letter of the law.
By the way, this is just clarifying ex-
isting law because of a bizarre interpre-
tation written by the Trump DOT a
year ago this June.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Chair, how much
time do I have remaining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Georgia has 1 minute remaining.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Chair, I know
my friend from Oregon, when he talked
about rotten politics and those motiva-
tions, wasn’t talking about me. I know
that he was not. If he had been, we
would have taken that conversation a
different direction. I know that he was
not because my concern is sincere.
The fact that so much of that con-
versation centered on the White House
does make me wonder whether or not
politics is at play here.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5049
June 24, 2019
To have the authorizing chairman
say on the floor of the House that there
is no statutory difference between the
Secretary ‘‘may’’ and the Secretary
‘‘shall’’ is the most shocking thing I
have heard in 2019. It is the definition
of a categorical difference.
We put ‘‘may’’ in there for a reason,
and that is to prevent a perversion of
the process, the perversion that I am
concerned about, the perversion that
my friend from Oregon could dismiss if
only we would hold a hearing in the
committee and allow me to hear from
some experts about it.
My concern is sincere, and the con-
cern of communities in my State is sin-
cere. There is a reason the House rules
prohibit doing this on the House floor
because our shared concerns are sin-
cere.
Mr. Chair, I urge support of the
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, if our colleague says that the
word ‘‘may’’ was put in to prevent a
perversion of the process, I will simply
say, as Mr. DEFAZIO has made very
clear, we put in the word ‘‘shall’’ to
prevent a clear and present perversion
of the process.
Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my
time to the gentleman from Oregon
(Mr. DEFAZIO).
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I certainly
wasn’t referring to my colleague, who I
know is here in good faith on his own
terms.
The point is, on June 29, 2017, the
DOT stated that TIFIA loans will not
be considered Federal funds for the
purposes of evaluating how much local
share an applicant brings to the table.
What changed in that year? All years
prior, that was allowed. In 2017, sud-
denly, they changed their mind.
That is what I am talking about, rot-
ten politics.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I yield back the balance of my
time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL).
The amendment was rejected.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from North Carolina (Mr. PRICE) and
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DIAZ-
BALART) each will control 10 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from North Carolina.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, the amendments included in the
en bloc amendment were made in order
by the rule.
Mr. Chair, I support this amendment.
I urge its adoption, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER).
Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chair, I thank the
chair for yielding.
My amendment provides direction to
do everything possible to fix the inde-
fensible disparity between States in
the per capita allocation of transpor-
tation funding through the Highway
Trust Fund. Under the current process,
known as apportionment, many States
receive far more in Federal funding for
surface transportation than they con-
tribute through the gas tax.
Apportionment in no way is a sci-
entific or mathematical formula but is
simply grandfathering in a table of
numbers that were used to buy votes in
the Senate generations ago.
Unsurprisingly, this table of numbers
greatly favors the low-population
States that are overrepresented in the
Senate.
This problem is compounded by the
fact that high-wage States like Illinois
pay more in taxes but get no credit for
this when income tax funds are trans-
ferred into the Highway Trust Fund. As
a result, some States receive some-
times five times more per person than
Illinois and other large States.
My amendment represents a clear
statement by the House of Representa-
tives that we should move toward a per
capita allotment that is fair to people
no matter what State they live in.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this en bloc package.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr.
MALINOWSKI).
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Chair, my
first amendment increases funding for
the Department of Transportation’s Of-
fice of the Inspector General by $1 mil-
lion and decreases funding for the Of-
fice of the Secretary by $1 million.
I am very concerned about recent re-
ports that the Department assigned
senior officials to smooth a ‘‘special
path’’ for the Senate majority leader’s
favored grant projects.
I have no problem with funding
transportation projects in Kentucky or
any other State. We should all have a
problem with the Department setting
up a concierge service for one State
while slow-walking obviously critical
projects like New Jersey’s Gateway
Program.
My second amendment makes clear
that the Capital Investment Grant pro-
gram cannot be run in a manner out-
side the bounds we have established in
law. Congress never intended for politi-
cally motivated, indefinite delays to
transportation projects or for some
projects to be held to a much higher
standard than others.
Infrastructure spending is something
we all agree on. It is something we all
need.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman has expired.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to
the gentleman from New Jersey.
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Every part of the
country will lose, if not now then even-
tually, if we allow grantmaking to be-
come politicized and the intent of Con-
gress to be ignored.
Mr. Chair, I urge support for the en
bloc amendment.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I yield back the balance of my
time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in
support to En Bloc No. 7, which includes Jack-
son Lee Amendment No. 242.
I wish to thank Chairman MCGOVERN and
Ranking Member COLE of the Rules Com-
mittee for making this Jackson Lee Amend-
ment in order.
I thank Chairman PRICE and Ranking Mem-
ber DIAZ-BALART for their hard work in bringing
Division E, the Transportation Housing and
Urban Development portion of this omnibus
appropriations legislative package, to the floor.
I include in the RECORD letters of endorse-
ment for this Jackson Lee Amendment pro-
vided by Bike Houston and the League of
American Bicyclists.
I thank them all for this opportunity to ex-
plain the Jackson Lee Amendment, which
makes a good bill even better by providing
$10 million to support urban bicycle and pe-
destrian safety programs.
In June the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration published its traffic fatality re-
port which showed a one percent decrease in
traffic fatalities and a four percent increase in
pedestrian fatalities but a whopping 10 percent
increase in bicyclist fatalities.
On March 30, 2019, in the city of Houston,
at the intersection of North Shepherd Drive
and West 10th Street located in the 18th Con-
gressional District of Texas, Lesha White, 54,
was driving with her daughters when she saw
Jesus ‘‘Jesse’’ Perez struggling to cross the
intersection in a wheelchair.
Ms. White pulled over and got out of her car
to help Mr. Perez cross the street when an-
other vehicle struck them, and they were both
killed.
On March 7, 2019, 23 year-old David Leon
Loya was killed in a collision with a school bus
while riding his bicycle in The Heights area of
Houston.
Police report that Mr. Loya was in the bike
lane and tried to avoid the accident by sliding
under the bus, but unfortunately he was run
over by the back axle.
This young man was greatly loved by his
family, the lives of the people he touched in
his volunteer work, and the bicyclist commu-
nity.
This amendment was offered in remem-
brance of Lesha White, Jesus ‘‘Jesse’’ Perez,
David Leon Loya, and all of the other pedes-
trians and bicyclists who have lost their lives
in accidents with motor vehicles in urban
areas.
In the past sixteen years, the Houston area
has seen 2,000 deaths of bicyclists and pe-
destrians, at an average of 100 a year, with
the last three years seeing the rate increase to
150 a year, according to federal statistics.
In 2017, the most recent year for which
comprehensive statistics are available, accord-
ing to the Texas Department of Transportation
(‘‘TDOT’’), the numbers were no more encour-
aging.
According to TDOT, 1,409 Houston-area pe-
destrians were injured in roadways crashes:
275 of them were injured seriously; 146 pe-
destrians were killed in roadways crashes; 639
bicyclists were injured in roadways crashes;
and 82 bicyclists were injured seriously.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Admin-
istration has called the number of deaths a
‘public health crisis.’
The problem is no more encouraging on the
national level as Texas ranks third nationwide
in bicycle deaths, behind California and Flor-
ida.
Nationwide, the number of fatal bicyclist ac-
cidents is rising and are also amounting to a
greater percentage of total traffic fatalities.
Cities are uniquely susceptible to this prob-
lem, as the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration reports that 70 of bicycle fatali-
ties occur in cities.
City of Houston Mayor Turner has launched
a Vision Zero Policy initiative to address the
issue of bicycle and pedestrian fatalities.
In May 2019, Mayor Turner invited bike ad-
vocacy groups like Bike Houston to partner
with LINK Houston to identify the 10 highest
priority intersections for improving pedestrian
and bicyclist safety.
LINK Houston analyzed motor vehicle
crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists
from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017,
to identify priority intersections across Hous-
ton.
This work identified seven priority intersec-
tions that if addressed could reduce pedes-
trian and bicyclist fatalities and injuries:
Fanning & Pierce; Rochester & Bellaire;
Westheimer & South Dairy Ashford; Long
Point & Gessner; Westpark Dr. & U.S. 59
South; Old Spanish Trail & U.S. 288 South,
Fondren & West Belfort; Bissonnet & Wilcrest;

The city then reached out to the Federal
Highway Administration to request their assist-
ance in performing a multi-disciplinary Road
Safety Audit for six of the twelve locations.
The city of Houston could fund six of the
areas that are listed as high priorities and
needs funding to perform assessments on the
remaining six.
Additionally, funding is needed to make the
needed changes to the intersections to im-
prove pedestrian and bicyclists safety.
We must come together to tackle this prob-
lem and work to ensure that we stem the tide
in these fatalities.
The rising death and injury toll of pedestrian
and bicyclists is alarming and merits serious
attention but as we know too tragically, behind
the statistics are stories about people who are
treasured and sorely missed by family, friends,
and coworkers.
I ask my colleagues to join me in support of
En Bloc No. 7, which includes Jackson Lee
Amendment No. 242 to help reduce the num-
ber of pedestrian and bicycle fatalities in urban
areas.

DEAR MS. CONEY: BikeHouston is writing
to endorse Jackson Lee Amendment 103 to
the Transportation. Housing and Urban De-
velopment Appropriations section of HR 3055.
Cities throughout the country are experi-
encing major changes to urban mobility, in-
cluding an increasing number of trips taken
by biking, walking, and riding scooters and
other micro-mobility options. At the same
time, fatalities are on the rise for people who
walk and ride a bike.
This month, June 2019, the National High-
way Traffic Safety Administration released
preliminary traffic fatality data for 2018 that
shows while overall traffic fatalities dropped
by one percent, pedestrian fatalities rose by
4 percent, and bicyclist fatalities rose by 10
percent! Nationally, bicycling and walking
account for 12 percent of transportation
trips, but 18 percent of overall traffic fatali-
ties, and yet states report spending less than
one percent of their highway safety funds to
address the too common deaths of vulnerable
road users. By setting aside funds to specifi-
cally address bicyclist and pedestrian fatali-
ties in cities, this amendment will help ad-
dress this unacceptable increase in fatalities
of our most vulnerable road users.
Thank you again introducing this amend-
ment to set aside national infrastructure in-
vestment funds to address bicyclist and pe-
destrian safety in cities. We look forward to
continuing our work with you to address this
serious issue.
Respectfully,

DYING TO RIDE,
(By Dane Schiller)
A CYCLE OF LOSSES
Teenager Miguel Marcial pedaled his bike
along a narrow, dark stretch of Richmond
Avenue early one morning last July, fol-
lowing closely behind his older brother. The
immigrant dish washers had worked the late
shift and were both biking to a nearby phar-
macy to buy toilet paper. Only a few feet
from the drug store’s parking lot, a brand-
new BMW driven by a law student, Steven
Moritz, who had just left the Estate Lounge,
smacked 17- year-old Marcial from behind
and launched him head-long into an oak
tree. The vehicle didn’t stop, according to
police. It dragged Marcial’s orange and white
bike beneath it for six blocks before dis-
appearing into the humid summer gloom.’’If
I had not pulled in, we would both be dead,’’
Miguel’s brother Palemon recalled
hauntingly last week.
Marcial was one of at least 23 bike riders
killed on Houston streets in the past five
years, according to police and safety reports,
as well as court and medical records re-
viewed by the Houston Chronicle. But only
four times in five years have drivers been
charged with a crime after fatally hitting a
cyclist.
The tally comes as tensions have increased
in Houston’s cycling community, with two
bike riders killed in recent weeks in un-
solved hit-and run crashes. Outspoken cy-
clists contend the city hasn’t created enough
clean, safe bike lanes. They also believe po-
lice aren’t ticketing cars for coming too
close to riders or doing enough to find people
who run them down.
Fred Zapalac, co-owner of Blue Line Bike
Lab bike shops and a cycling community ad-
vocate, said anger is simmering over a lack
of accountability.
‘‘If we are getting run down, and there are
no consequences for the driver’s actions then
our lives have about as much value as a
stray animal,’’ Zapalac said.
A review of municipal court records con-
ducted at the Chronicle’s request found that
no citations were issued during the first six
months of a city ordinance that went into ef-
fect in May and required that cars stay at
least 3 feet from cyclists and pedestrians,
and trucks 6 feet away.
Some motorists, however, counter that
certain cyclists think they own the ’roads
and openly defy traffic laws.
City Council Member Ed Gonzalez, who has
been an advocate for cycling issues, said
more should be done to protect and educate
riders, as well as motorists, and train police
on enforcing the 3-feet ordinance.
‘‘We are a very car-centric city,’’ he said.
‘‘We are very dependent on the automobiles,
and we don’t have a very robust mass transit
system. There are some major shifts that
need to occur.’’
THREE CONVICTED
Crashes that claimed the lives of riders
over the past five years are often a ’blend of
bad choices by bike riders and motorists.
Three drivers were convicted after plead-
ing guilty in agreements that include de-
ferred adjudication—a form of probation that
enables them to have their criminal records
cleaned if they stay out of trouble.
One was for causing an accident with a
death, another for criminally negligent
homicide, and a third for failing to stop at
the scene.
Moritz, a student at South Texas College
of Law, was eventually arrested and faces up
to 10 years in prison if he is convicted of fail-
ing to stop and render aid. Marcial’s death
was typical among fallen cyclists and re-
flects a reality about many people who ride
bikes in this city.
He was riding for transportation, not exer-
cise. He was in the street, not on a bike path.
Marcial and his brother had recently got-
ten off work. Like many undocumented
workers, they didn’t have cars or driver’s li-
censes, so they rode bikes.
But his death also stands out.
There were witnesses and charges were
filed, although authorities didn’t know about
Moritz until more than a week after the inci-
dent when a lawyer for the car’s owner called
police.
He is not accused of breaking the law by
killing Marcial, but by not stopping after-
ward and calling for help. Moritz’s lawyer, J.
Gordon Dees, declined comment.
‘REALLY FRUSTRATING’
The deaths cross the spectrum of cir-
cumstance, from cyclists who were riding on
sidewalks to others who tried to roll across
freeways.
Mohammad Qureshi, then 19, was driving
along the Southwest Freeway in 2010, when
he bolted across four lanes of the highway to
make the Hillcroft exit. He lost control of
His Honda Accord and hit a cyclist riding on
the sidewalk of the service drive.
A year later, he pleaded guilty to crimi-
nally negligent homicide in the death of
Marcotulio .’’Benjamin’’ Tzul as part of an
agreement that requires him to serve 45 days
in jail in five-day chunks: nine days each
year for five years, through 2015. In 2010,
Carmenza Arreaga, then 24, pleaded guilty to
a charge of ‘‘accident involving death’’ of
Paul Miller and was required to pay $18,000
in restitution to the bike rider’s family.
She hit Miller in the early morning hours
along the Loop 610 feeder road and drove
away, leaving behind pieces of the front
bumper of her Honda Civic. An anonymous
tip to Crime Stoppers led to her arrest.
Jonathan Turner pleaded guilty in 2010 to
failing to stop and render assistance after
the death of Anthony Jones, who was trying
to cross Interstate 45 at 10:15 p.m. Turner
was given 30 days in jail and ordered to pay
$5,199 in restitution. A sheriff’s deputy
caught him at a gas station trying to pull a
mangled bicycle out from under his Chevy
Tahoe.
Harris County prosecutor Alison
Baimbridge said it is not unusual for defend-
ants to serve sentences in segments on the
anniversary of a victim’s death to repeatedly
remind them they killed someone and didn’t
go to prison.

‘‘There is no sentence that you can give
anybody that would actually justify losing
somebody’s life,’’ she said. ‘‘You can’t do
that, you can’t bring them back. You have to
look at the defendant’s life, the cir-
cumstances and any potential issues in the
case.’’
Despite criticism from some cyclists who
contend authorities treat biker deaths as
less than a priority, Baimbridge said the
cases are investigated as thoroughly as the
deaths of motorists or pedestrians.
‘‘Their lives are just as valuable as anyone
else’s,’’ she said. She said many cases in
which bikers have been killed in car crashes
are especially challenging because they often
involve both the motorist and the cyclist
doing something wrong.
‘‘It is kind of a double-fault situation,’’ she
said of cases such as when motorists should
have steered clear of a cyclist, but the cy-
clist was crossing the street inappropriately
or not having reflectors or lights.
Among the toughest cases are hit and runs
where no one saw the incident, she said. ‘‘It
is really frustrating,’’ she said. ‘‘Their fami-
lies deserve to know what happened, if noth-
ing else. It is horrible.’’
HIT AND RUN
In the two hit-and-run crashes in recent
weeks there have been no arrests. Nabor
Rosas, 40, was found in the bayou in mid-
January after he was hit riding over a bridge
on Harrisburg at night on the way home and
landed in the water.
Chelsea Norman, 24, was killed in the
Montrose neighborhood in early December as
she rode home from her job at Whole Foods,
also at night.
Each time a bike rider’s death makes the
news it hits hard for Xenia Sanchez. Her
daughter, Leslie Roman, 6, was riding her
bike in 2009 in her apartment complex park-
ing lot when she was hit and killed by a sil-
ver PT Cruiser that has never been found.
‘‘It comes back,’’ she said at a table be-
neath three photos of Leslie that were hung
on the wall as part of a shrine of sorts, along
with her daughter’s Barbie doll perched on a
shelf beneath them.
‘‘I know exactly how his or her mom is
feeling. It is painful to see other people go
through what we went through.’’
Leslie’s father, Leonardo Roman, who ran
into the parking lot and picked up his daugh-
ter, who was still barely alive, found some
peace in that though her body was badly bat-
tered, she was not crushed.
‘‘It could have been so much worse,’’ he
said quietly.
Houston Police Sgt. Carlos Miller, of the
vehicular crimes division, said there are
many reasons why motorists flee after hit-
ting a bike rider.
‘‘A lot of times they are frantic over what
just happened,’’ he said, noting that they can
be motivated to drive away by everything
from fear, even if they have done nothing
wrong, to wanting to hide the tracks of other
criminality.
Among the others to die was Cruz Riojas,
67, who worked in sculpture repair. He was
riding back to work in 2011 from an Alco-
holics Anonymous meeting. He had been on
the sidewalk on Sawyer Street, just outside
the Heights neighborhood, but was hit as he
tried to cross an intersection.
The car’s driver, Ricardo Abonce, 30, said
he was coming back from a Target and drove
through the intersection with a green light.
Riojas came over the car’s hood and hit the
windshield.
It was a moment of ‘‘silent shock’’ as the
glass shattered, then as he got out of the car
and other motorists streamed by honking at
him.
‘‘I feel bad because he didn’t make it,’’
Abonce said. ‘‘I can’t have that over me all
the time.’’
Police found that Riojas was at fault for
crossing an intersection when he had the red
light. No charges were filed against Abonce.
NEVER FORGET
One of the few sport riders to be killed was
Jonathan Lennard. The 47–yearold aerospace
engineer, known for being meticulous, had
once traveled to Europe to see the Tour de
France and cycled across that continent.
He was killed last August, on Memorial,
where it cuts through Memorial Park, after
being struck by a 19-year-old motorist.
The driver told police that he had the
green light and swerved to avoid Lennard.
Police found that Lennard was at fault.
But Kevin Hood, a lawyer who is a cyclist
and runner, said he was watching Lennard
and believes the driver was not paying atten-
tion and ran a red light.
Hood said he will never forget what he saw.
‘‘It is terrifying. You cannot unsee that
stuff.’’
Back where Marcial lived, a few blocks
from where there are now flowers and a cross
rising from the dirt beneath the tree where
he landed, his family waits for answers.
They have adapted to Houston, but some
struggle with English and even Spanish, as
they are from a rural region of Mexico where
an indigenous language is spoken.
Marcial had been in Houston three weeks.
He was proud of his first paycheck and
planned to save enough to one day go back
home and buy a house.
Family in Houston who had not seen him
since he was very young was just getting to
know him. The brothers went to the store so
they would be ready for a party at their
apartment later that Sunday.
They decided to ride in the street because
the sidewalk was a minefield of cracks, tele-
phone poles and trees. The road was empty.
‘‘There was no noise,’’ Marcial’s brother
recalled, ‘‘not even any cars.’’

Mr. Chair, I congratulate Mr. MEAD-

I also thank Mr. GRAVES and Mr.

Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Chair,
my amendment supports the Federal
Aviation Administration Airport and
Airway Trust Fund. This program is re-
sponsible for the research, engineering,
and development of aircraft tech-
nologies that reduce aviation noise.
In my district, communities near
JFK Airport and La Guardia Airport
must endure the constant noise of
overhead aircraft, and other commu-
nities farther away are beginning to
experience significant airplane noise as
a result of newly developed flight
plans.
I am disappointed that the FAA re-
cently announced it would postpone
important minimum altitude regula-
tions for certain flight patterns coming
into JFK Airport, and I call on the
FAA to implement these regulations as
soon as possible.
While changing flight paths are no
silver bullet to solving airplane noise,
we must continue to adequately fund
Federal efforts to discover new tech-
nologies that can retrofit existing air-
planes to be quieter for the benefit of
communities not just on Long Island,
but airport communities across the
country.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. GARCÍA).
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Mr. Chair, I
offer this amendment to bring atten-
tion to the provision I fought to in-
clude in the Transportation, Housing
and Urban Development funding pack-
age.
With support from the Amalgamated
Transit Union, we were able to secure
$5 million in technical assistance and
training in this bill, with a specific $2.5
million set aside for frontline bus, rail,
and transit workers.
These critical funds would provide
frontline workers with professional de-
velopment and training to help bus and
transit operators hone their profes-
sional skills. This funding will make
our public transit safer, more efficient,
and help workers better provide for
their families as they climb up the pro-
fessional ladder.
Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman PRICE
and NITA LOWEY for supporting the in-
clusion of this provision, and I urge
support for this en bloc amendment.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, we are prepared to close,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I rise today in sup-
port of En Bloc Amendment number eight,
which includes my amendment to reaffirm Am-
trak’s legal obligations under the Worker Ad-
justment and Retraining Notification (WARN)
Act.
The WARN Act was created to protect work-
ers and their families by requiring certain em-
ployers to provide notice 60 days in advance
of mass layoffs. As many of my constituents
learned first-hand, having advance notice of a
major staffing decision is essential for employ-
ees so they can make thoughtful and delib-
erate decisions about their future and the fu-
ture of their families.
Last year, Amtrak shuttered a reservation
call center in my district. Hundreds of my con-
stituents and their families had just 60 days’
notice before having to decide whether to up-
root their lives and accept another Amtrak job
across the country—or accept a meager sev-
erance package and keep their families rooted
in the community they grew up in and love. It
was part of Amtrak’s tactic to only meet the
statutory requirement of providing 60 days’ no-
tice under the WARN Act and force attrition by
applying pressure on its employees. Today,
we must go further to protect these workers.
Congress must reaffirm the legal require-
ments under the WARN Act, but also strength-
en these protections to ensure that workers
have more advance notice of executive deci-
sions that will impact their lives. Congress
must also ensure that the penalties for vio-
lating this law will send a clear message to
employers that this anti-worker behavior will
not be tolerated.
Mr. Chair, I thank Representatives KEN CAL-
VERT, BRENDAN BOYLE, and PAUL COOK for
joining me in putting forth this bipartisan
amendment and I look forward to building on
these protections for workers all across the
United States.

The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division E (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. None of the funds made available
by this Act may be used to carry out section
4(b) of Executive Order 13868 or to issue a
special permit under section 107.105 of title
49, Code of Federal Regulations, that allows
liquified natural gas to move by rail tank
car.

House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Oregon.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chair, this is an
extraordinary move to suddenly turn
trains into liquid natural gas pipelines.
Of course, liquid natural gas is not
transported by pipeline. It brittlizes
metal, and this would be a new and in-
novative way of moving liquified nat-
ural gas.
Now, there are a few problems with
this. We had the Administrator into
the committee last week. It is going to
be moved in DOT 113 tank cars.
I said: Are those puncture-proof?
He said: No, they are not puncture-
proof.
I said: Well, what happens?
He said: Oh, we carry volatiles all the
time.
I said: You don’t carry anything like
liquified natural gas.
There is something called the
BLEVE; it is a boiling liquified explo-
sive vapor explosion. So the BLEVE
has an unbelievable blast impact. And
this is just one rail car. These will be
six trains a day going through the most
populated parts of Florida, 100 cars in
each train.
Envision this: Here is Fort Lauder-
dale, Florida. This is the blast zone.
And that is just one—one—of these
tank cars. It is likely it will cause a
chain reaction and explosion. It is
going to be about as powerful as Hiro-
shima if it goes off.
Now, this maybe will get someone’s
attention. This is the Brightline high-
speed rail line. That is where they are
going to run six trains a day with 100
cars of liquified natural gas—never,
ever been done before; except in small
containers, never been done before.
And, oh, by the way, within the blast
zone is Mar-a-Lago. Are they going to
allow the trains to run while the Presi-
dent is there?
All you need is someone with a .50
caliber to shoot a hole in one of those
tank cars and you are going to have
one humongous explosion that goes be-
yond Mar-a-Lago.
So what is the foolishness?
The Pipeline and Hazardous Safety
Materials Agency has not evaluated
this. They are the ones who are sup-
posed to do this. They haven’t finished
imposing laws that we put in place in

2011 for the safe movement of haz-
ardous goods, but now they are rushing
this through.
The administration says, oh, no, we
want this permit done in 12 months.
Well, maybe the President doesn’t
know he is in a blast zone. Maybe he
wouldn’t be ordering it be done in 12
months if he knew it was within the
blast zone.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I
rise in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Florida is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman,
liquefied natural gas is a major compo-
nent of domestic U.S. energy growth,
and it is facilitating the export of U.S.
natural gas around the world.
Railroads have been successfully
moving flammable gases for 100 years.
As a matter of fact, Transport Canada
already allows LNG on rail and tank
cars. So this provision would put us at
a huge disadvantage with our largest
trading partner.
Furthermore, DOT always conducts a
thorough, comprehensive, and trans-
parent safety evaluation, accounting
for public input and, again, before al-
lowing for transportation of any haz-
ardous material.
This amendment would block a prov-
en process at DOT and would inhibit
U.S. LNG from meeting growing mar-
kets, the demand from growing mar-
kets for cleaner—again, cleaner—and
more affordable energy.
And again, Mr. Chairman, this is an-
other important point. Currently, this
is moved by trucks. They are all over
the country, trucks moving LNG. And
so, obviously, the question is: Are rails
less safe than moving this on trucks?
Obviously, the answer, I would say, is
no.
Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
The gentleman referred to trucks.
Actually, we are talking about very
small quantities in special containers,
not massive rail tank cars holding
these amounts.
Another thing is that there is no
known company. You can’t contact
them. There is no publicly available
contact information, no headquarters,
but they have petitioned and they are
going through a special permit process
with—the gentleman says there is
going to be public review and input—
sure—to move six trains a day with 100
cars in each one, essentially, a liquid
pipeline through these heavily popu-
lated areas.
We saw what happened at Lac-
Megantic up in Canada with just crude
oil in tank cars killing dozens of peo-
ple, obliterating a town. This is 10
times more powerful than that.
Yet the gentleman from Florida is
advocating that this should happen in
Florida, and the people living all along
the Brightline—Fort Lauderdale, Hol-
lywood, the President at Mar-a-Lago—
just shouldn’t worry their sweet little
heads about it: It won’t be a target of
terrorists; there won’t be an accident;
it is never going to happen. Well, we
have heard that before.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I
would just remind everyone that there
are trucks with natural gas right in
Florida and in, pretty much, every
State around the Nation.
Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
Oklahoma (Mr. KEVIN HERN).
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Mr.
Chairman, I rise in opposition to this
amendment.
Mr. Chairman, the liquid natural gas
revolution going on in this country is
making us more energy secure, and it
is revitalizing our local economies
across the country.
According to the Department of En-
ergy, natural gas applies to nearly one-
third of the United States’ primary en-
ergy. It is the primary heating fuel for
approximately half the U.S. house-
holds.
The oil and gas industry generates
more than $50 billion a year in my
home State of Oklahoma. The industry
has been the single largest contributor
to Oklahoma tax revenues in recent
years.
The discovery of promising new nat-
ural gas formations in the Permian
Basin of Texas and New Mexico along
with the Marcellus shale formation in
Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia, Mary-
land, Pennsylvania, and New York
show that the near-term future of our
country’s energy mix will be supplied
by an abundance of natural gas.
Natural gas is a cost-effective, reli-
able, and clean form of energy that has
created thousands of high-paying jobs
across the Nation, including in Okla-
homa’s First Congressional District.
America is now the world’s largest pro-
ducer of natural gas. For the first time
since 1957, we are a net exporter of nat-
ural gas to the rest of the world.
Recognizing the benefit that the nat-
ural gas revolution is having on our
economy and energy security, Presi-
dent Trump issued an executive order
in April of this year. Section 4(b) of the
executive order requires the Depart-
ment of Transportation Secretary to
propose a rule for notice and public
comment that would ‘‘treat liquid nat-
ural gas the same as other cryogenic
liquids and permit liquid natural gas to
be transported in approved rail tank
cars.’’
Mr. Chairman, no matter our produc-
tion levels of natural gas, we cannot
realize its full potential unless we have
safe and reliable ways to transport it.
That is what the President’s executive
order is all about.
I believe this amendment unneces-
sarily takes away a vital transpor-
tation option for transporting our nat-
ural gas to both underserved markets
on the mainland United States and to
our ports so it can be exported around
the world.
With certain States making it more
difficult to transport LNG by pipeline,
we need all the available options at our
disposal to transport these much-need-
ed energy sources.
We have been transporting oil by rail
for decades, but since liquid natural
gas is a relatively new energy com-
modity, Federal rules and regulations
have not caught up to the need for
flexibility in transporting LNG, which
is why I was pleased to see section 4(b)
included in President Trump’s execu-
tive order.
Instead of trying to inhibit this ad-
ministration’s effort to make our Na-
tion more energy secure, I believe we
should be assisting them in any way
possible to benefit our economy and
our energy security.
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I ask that
my colleagues join me in opposing this
amendment.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chair, may I in-
quire as to how much time I have re-
maining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon has 1 minute remaining.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self 10 seconds.
Again, this has potential for massive
explosions. This has not been done be-
fore.
This is not natural gas. It is liquefied
natural gas, 600 times as dense, and, if
punctured, this is the blast zone. I hope
the President is watching.
Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. PRICE), the sub-
committee chairman.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I thank the gentleman for
raising this issue.
I want to note that the underlying
bill provides $1 million for the Trans-
portation Research Board to conduct a
study to review all aspects of the
transportation of liquefied natural gas
in rail tank cars, and it requires the
Department to incorporate findings
and recommendations from this study
into any rulemaking on the transpor-
tation of LNG in rail tank cars before
issuing a final rule authorizing such
shipments.
Mr. Chair, I plan to vote for this
amendment, and I look forward to con-
tinuing to work with my colleague on
this issue.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chair, I find it ironic that some
of the same folks who are concerned
about climate change and global warm-
ing want to make it so difficult to
transport things that actually lower
emissions compared to other sources of
energy.
Mr. Chair, I ask for a ‘‘yes’’ vote on
the amendment, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chair, again, in
closing, I think it would be wise to ac-
tually conduct a study before this is

The question was taken; and the Act-

AMENDMENT NO. 234 OFFERED BY MR. DUNCAN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 234 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Strike line 20 on page 642 and all that fol-
lows through page 643, line 8.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN) and
a Member opposed each will control 5

The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from South Carolina.
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today to offer a commonsense amend-
ment that will allow the Department of
Housing and Urban Development Sec-
retary Ben Carson to restore the long-
standing, scientific definition of gender
as it relates to federally subsidized
same-sex housing.
The underlying legislation strips the
Secretary of that power, and my com-
monsense amendment simply gives it
back to him. I ask the House to sup-
port my amendment, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I rise in strong opposition
to this amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from North Carolina is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Virginia (Ms. WEXTON).
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today in strong opposition to the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from South Carolina.
June is LGBT Pride Month, a time
when people across the country are
taking a positive stance against dis-
crimination and violence against LGBT
individuals, but this amendment seeks
to allow discrimination against the
LGBT community in HUD-funded hous-
ing and shelters.
Make no mistake, this amendment
will weaken protections for LGBT peo-
ple, especially children, who are experi-
encing homelessness and fleeing nat-
ural disasters, as well as survivors of
violence.
These protections are important be-
cause nearly one-third of transgender
and gender nonbinary people experi-
ence homelessness at some point in
their life; about one-half of transgender
people do.
According to a Center for American
Progress study done in 2015, only 30
percent of shelter providers across four
States, including my own of Virginia,
were willing to properly accommodate
transgender women. According to an-
other recent survey, over half of
transgender survey respondents who
stayed in a shelter in the past year
were verbally harassed, physically at-
tacked, and/or sexually assaulted be-
cause of their gender identity.
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER), chairwoman
of the House Values Action Team.
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chairman, I
rise to support my colleague’s amend-
ment to strike section 236 from this
bill. This amendment will preserve the
right of women to be protected in a do-
mestic violence shelter designated just
for them, free from the unexpected and
unsettling presence of a man identi-
fying as a woman sharing the same fa-
cility. Faith-based organizations and
many community organizations seg-
regate programs based on gender, but
under the Obama administration, rules
were changed allowing policies that
forced domestic violence survivors into
unwanted and unsafe coed housing ar-
rangements.
We can see how this is causing prob-
lems as already in Anchorage, Alaska,
Downtown Hope Center’s mission was
providing overnight shelter for abused
and battered women. However, the cen-
ter is facing a lawsuit for not allowing
a man, who identifies as a woman, ac-
cess to the women’s shelter.
The core to the Downtown Hope Cen-
ter’s mission of providing women suf-
fering from rape, physical abuse, and
domestic violence as a safe place to
sleep at night without the presence of
men, is at risk.
This nonsense must stop, and I urge
my colleagues to support this very
commonsense amendment for the pro-
tection of women.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tlewoman from Virginia (Ms. WEXTON).
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Some say that this amendment will
negatively impact the safety and pri-
vacy of women in shelters. Service pro-
viders around the country who operate
shelters every day disagree. These pro-
viders believe that nondiscrimination
protections are necessary to ensure ev-
eryone in need can access shelters.
Over 300 domestic and sexual violence
organizations across the country
signed a national consensus statement
in support of full and equal access for
the transgender community. These
leaders agree that serving transgender
women victims in shelters is appro-
priate and does not pose a safety issue.
While housing transgender people ac-
cording to their gender identity does
not propose a safety risk to others,
failing to do so puts transgender people
in danger. Transgender people experi-
ence shockingly high rates of sexual
and physical violence and forcing
transgender people to use facilities
that don’t match their gender identity
leaves them at risk for harassment, as-
sault, and a host of harms that result
when people avoid using the bathroom
during the day.
Allowing shelter providers to decide
who is eligible for access to single-sex
or sex-segregated shelters opens the
door to discrimination. Make no mis-
take, this is incredibly dangerous. The
consequences of being turned away
from a shelter can be dire.
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. ROY).
Mr. ROY. Mr. Chair, I thank the gen-
tleman from South Carolina for yield-
ing.
In 2016, HUD published a final rule,
the Equal Access in Accordance with
an Individual’s Gender Identity in
Community Planning and Development
Programs rule requiring Community
Planning and Development-funded sin-
gle-sex projects ‘‘to provide all individ-
uals, including transgender individuals
and other individuals who do not iden-
tify with the sex they were assigned at
birth, with access to programs, bene-
fits, services, and accommodations in
accordance with their gender identity
without being subjected to intrusive
questioning or being asked to provide
documentation.’’
This rule prohibits a HUD-funded
shelter from providing for single-sex
facilities based on an individual’s gen-
der at birth. There are other rules that
were put in place in the Obama admin-
istration, similarly. None of these rules
recognize that housing programs, par-
ticularly faith-based facilities, ability
to distinguish between genders and an
individual’s marital status; both rules
placing vulnerable women at risk.
This administration announced a
proposed rule that ‘‘permits shelter
providers to consider a range of factors
in making such determinations, includ-
ing: privacy, safety, practical concerns,
religious beliefs, any relevant consider-
ations under civil rights and non-
discrimination authorities . . . ‘’ I
could go on. It is a commonsense rule.
Yet, now, we are sitting here in an
appropriations bill when we are sup-
posed to be figuring out how to fund
the important, ailing infrastructure of
this country, housing and urban devel-
opment, figure out how to solve the
problems in this country, while we
have got a border that is being over-
whelmed every single day—yes, I am
coming back to that because it is the
crisis of our day—and now we are turn-
ing this into a gender-identity game.

of this administration to have a com-
monsense rule to ensure that people
are safe when we have got facilities in
place and the Federal Government has
something to do it with. I applaud him
for doing so.
I would ask my Democrat colleagues
why we are not getting back to the
business of the day, making sure that
we have strong infrastructure, strong
border security, and doing the job the
American people actually sent us to do
instead of manufacturing social engi-
neering and gender identities.
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Chair, I ask my
colleagues to support this amendment.
It is important that we give the Sec-
retary the ability to set this definition.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. May I
inquire how much time I have remain-
ing.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from North Carolina has 3 minutes re-
maining.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I am baffled and distressed
that my colleagues seem so intent on
targeting such a vulnerable population.
This Equal Access in Accordance
with an Individual’s Gender Identity in
Community Planning and Development
Programs rule simply ensures that all
Americans have access to HUD services
regardless of sexual orientation, gender
identity, or marital status.
This amendment strikes protections
for homeless youth seeking help in
shelters. It also strikes eligibility for
other HUD programs and for FHA
loans. Mr. Chairman, research shows
that same-sex couples and transgender
individuals experience significant dis-
crimination when seeking housing.
LGBTQ youth comprise up to 40 per-
cent of the homeless population. Let
me, again, remind my colleagues of the
risks faced, as Ms. WEXTON has
stressed, the risks faced by
transgender, homeless youth when
they are living on the streets.
This population is much more likely
to experience physical, emotional, sex-
ual abuse, intimate partner violence,
sexual exploitation, or trafficking.
LGBTQ youth have over twice the rate
of early death compared to other youth
experiencing homelessness.
When these young people arrive at a
shelter, they are not a safety risk for
others. On the contrary, they are des-
perate. They are vulnerable. Many are
homeless because their families re-
jected them for being transgender. We
should be doing everything we can to
ensure they have alternatives to living
on the streets, and that when they ask
for help, they are not turned away and
revictimized.
Secretary Carson assured our com-
mittee and our colleagues on the Fi-
nancial Services Committee as well,
that HUD would not revoke these pro-
tections. But right after he made those
assurances, the announcement came
that he was doing just that.
Our subcommittee has repeatedly
asked the Department to provide a re-
port detailing their strategy for con-
tinuing to ensure that LGBTQ individ-
uals have access to HUD programs, and
that they plan for disseminating this
information to housing providers. They
have yet to provide such a strategy or
such a plan, leaving us with no choice,
Mr. Chairman, but to enshrine the
Equal Access in Accordance with an In-
dividual’s Gender Identity in Commu-
nity Planning and Development Pro-
grams rule in law, and to permanently
reinstate the Department’s guidance to
ensure that providers have the tools
they need to protect and to serve this
vulnerable population.
This heartless amendment would lead
to more discrimination, more homeless
LGBTQ youth, and more vulnerability
to abuse and violence.
We simply must vote ‘‘no,’’ and I
urge my colleagues to do so, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tleman from South Carolina (Mr. DUN-
CAN).

Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today to offer another commonsense
amendment that will allow the Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment Secretary Ben Carson to restore
the longstanding and scientific defini-
tion of gender as it relates to federally
subsidized same-sex homeless shelters.
The underlying legislation strips the
Secretary of that power, and my com-
monsense amendment simply gives it
back to him. By doing this, we are
working to protect at-risk homeless
women and children in the shelters.
I ask the House to support the
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.

amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from North Carolina is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I yield such time as she may
consume to the gentlewoman from
Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK).
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr.
Chairman, I join Chairman PRICE in
strong opposition to this amendment.
Two years ago, HUD removed guidance
that was meant to ensure our
transgender community members are
able to access emergency housing or
homeless shelters.
House Democrats stood up against
this assault on LGBTQ Americans, and
HUD Secretary Ben Carson assured us
that the removal of this guidance was
only temporary.
Later this spring, Secretary Carson
testified that we should not be pressing
for guidance or pressing him on this
issue because we wouldn’t like the an-
swer that HUD would provide.
b 1615
In other words, HUD stood ready to
explicitly allow or promote LGBTQ
discrimination.
Discrimination in any form for any
amount of time is reprehensible and
unacceptable, and now we have an
amendment before us that would make
housing discrimination permanent. It
would continue the uncertainty around
LGBTQ protections and make vulner-
able people’s lives harder.
Let’s remember what is at stake. One
in three transgender people have expe-
rienced homelessness, and we know
that homelessness in the LGBTQ com-
munity overwhelmingly impacts our
young people.
Right now, there are approximately
350,000 transgender people under the
age of 25 in the U.S., and it is esti-
mated that over 20 percent of them
lack secure housing.
Through the appropriations process,
House Democrats have put in place
protections for transgender Americans
and have taken the proactive step of
protecting the rights of LGBTQ indi-
viduals in emergency housing interven-
tion situations.
No American seeking refuge and safe-
ty should be kicked to the curb. No one
should be discriminated against, espe-
cially not in a time of dire need.
Mr. Chairman, I urge every Member
of this body to reject this amendment,
reject discrimination, and reject the
Trump administration’s and Secretary
Carson’s cruel rollback of LGBTQ pro-
tections.
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield

Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER), who heads

amendment which would strike section
237 from the underlying legislation be-
cause without this amendment, a Feb-
ruary 2015 HUD notice, which is no
longer applicable under this adminis-
tration and which requires the place-
ment of transgender persons in single-
sex emergency shelters, would become
law.

Should this notice become Federal
law, it would offer no protections for
women facing harassment in the shel-
ters’ showering or sleeping areas. This
bad policy is at the heart of the Cali-
fornia emergency shelter lawsuit. Nine
women were sexually harassed by a
male by birth, a trans individual, while
using the showering facilities. The
women’s shelter confessed that they
would rather allow the abuse to con-
tinue than lose Federal grant funding.
The shelter went as far as threatening
the nine women out of the shelter if
they continued to refuse to shower
with their attacker. This is prepos-
terous.
We should not codify this notice. In-
stead, HUD must review and strength-
en its resolution and notices governing
shelters and housing so that these ex-
amples do not become the new normal.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to join me in supporting Mr. DUNCAN’s
amendment.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I rise in strong support—in
strong opposition to this amendment.
Our subcommittee has repeatedly
asked the Department to provide a re-
port detailing their strategy for con-
tinuing to ensure that LGBTQ individ-
uals have access to HUD programs and
the plan for disseminating that infor-
mation to housing providers. HUD has
yet to provide any strategy or any
plan. So that is why we have acted. It
has left us no choice but to act.
This House took great strides a few
weeks ago in passing the Equality Act,
and we are certainly not going to turn
around today and take those rights
away. I am offended we have not one,
not two, but three amendments de-
signed precisely to take those rights
away.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to oppose this discrimination and to

and why I support the gentleman from
South Carolina’s amendment to make
sure that the Secretary of HUD has the
ability to do his job and to do the right
thing.
I notice that my friend on the other
side of the aisle mentioned the Equal-
ity Act. Well, what I am hearing from
my constituents in Texas is they are
concerned. They are concerned that
were the Equality Act to be passed out
of the Senate, it would undermine the
ability of their daughters to compete.
What we are seeing around the country
is boys who decide to declare them-
selves females run in races and make it
impossible for girls to compete. This is
happening. We see it. It is happening in
real time.
I just wonder what my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle think is
being accomplished with an Equality
Act that turns on its head the very
idea and the very notion of what we
have got with respect to the differences
between men and women and the abil-
ity to recognize that, embrace it, and
be able to have women compete in
sports.
Here we are in this false name of
equality blowing up the ability of sec-
retaries and people in the administra-
tion to make commonsense determina-
tions about how to house people, to
make tough choices, and to be able to
figure out what to do. Heaven forbid
they rely upon biological sex to make
that determination.
This is why my wife and I, who have
been products of public schools K
through law school, have our children
in a private school because we keep
getting our values blown to heck and
common sense blown to heck in schools
where bathrooms suddenly become so-
cial engineering experiments.
That is what we see happening as a
result of what is happening in the body
and what is happening in an appropria-
tions bill.
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Chairman, I want
to thank my colleagues for joining me
on this.
We all know that many of the home-
less on our streets have mental issues,
but my colleagues on the other side of
the aisle are okay with allowing those
homeless men in the bathrooms with
our female children, and that is just
wrong.
Mr. Chairman, this is a commonsense
amendment. I ask my colleagues to
support it, and I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, may I ask how much time is
remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
has 11⁄2 minutes remaining.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, this incredible amendment
would target some of our most vulner-
able people in our society today.
A study by True Colors United found
that among homeless transgender
youth, 75 percent had been victims of
physical, emotional, or sexual abuse; 25
percent had been victims of intimate
partner violence; and 20 percent had
been victims of sexual exploitation or
trafficking.
Mr. Chairman, more than 300 domes-
tic violence and sexual violence organi-
zations have signed a national con-
sensus statement agreeing it is appro-
priate to serve transgender women
alongside other women according to
their gender identity.
They agreed there is no safety issue
despite the rhetoric heard today. In
fact, transgender women are much
more likely to suffer abuse themselves.
So let’s not turn that safety issue on
its head. Let’s reinstate the guidance,
let’s enforce the rule, and let’s make
certain that in this society people are
treated equally and fairly.
Mr. Chairman, let’s reject this
amendment. I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. DUN-
CAN).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Chairman, I de-
mand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from South Carolina
will be postponed.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, as the designee of Chair-
woman LOWEY, I move to strike the
last word.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman
from California (Mrs. NAPOLITANO) for
the purpose of a colloquy.
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chair, I
thank Chairman PRICE for yielding and
discussing this issue with me regarding
the FAA’s recent threat to withhold
over $250 million annually in FAA
grants to California’s airports and di-
vert over $70 million in voter approved
local general sales tax away from their
voter approved purpose for transpor-
tation, police, fire, and the healthcare
of our citizens.
Mr. Chairman, on May 17, California
and Illinois were sent letters by FAA
threatening to withhold Federal avia-
tion funds because FAA believes the
States have not followed a 2014 FAA
policy change which would require
State and local governments across the
country—not just California and Illi-
nois—to use general sale taxes col-
lected on aviation fuel for airport pur-
poses.
Although FAA sent the first letters
to California and Illinois, they have
sent letters of inquiry to other States
like Georgia, and this issue also has
significant effects in Georgia and any
State and local government that has
aviation fuel as a part of their general
sales tax.
Mr. Chairman, California sent a let-
ter to the FAA over a year and a half
ago on December 8, 2017, explaining
their plan of action for compliance
with the FAA policy change. FAA did
not respond to California’s letter until
last month when they gave California
30 days to change their compliance
plan and seek burdensome tax informa-
tion from all 58 State counties and over
100 cities in our State.
This is further concerning in the
State of California because our general
sales taxes are voter approved by two-

thirds margin. FAA is trying to under-
mine the will of our California voters.
Mr. Chairman, I ask that you work
with me and my colleagues who are
concerned about FAA’s action and with
Representatives ALAN LOWENTHAL,
JARED HUFFMAN, ADAM SCHIFF, HARLEY
ROUDA, JOHN GARAMENDI, SALUD
CARBAJAL, DAVID SCOTT, and JOHN
LEWIS in addressing this situation re-
garding FAA’s threat of unreasonable
enforcement on many States and local
governments.
Mr. Chairman, I thank you very
much.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I thank the gentlewoman and
the colleagues she mentioned for bring-
ing up this important issue. It may im-
pose legal and financial challenges to
certain States. Certainly it is an im-
portant issue for my friend from Cali-
fornia and for her State, so I will be
happy to work with her and the FAA to
find a mutually acceptable solution.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee
of Chairwoman LOWEY, and I move to
strike the last word.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I yield to the gentleman
from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN) for the
purpose of a colloquy.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today to share the frustrations of
many of my constituents who are suf-
fering from severe noise pollution
caused by the FAA’s NextGen program
which has altered flight paths to
Reagan National Airport. Montgomery
County, Maryland, residents who live
as much as 20 miles away from the air-
port have experienced a 300 to 500 per-
cent increase in air traffic over their
homes. These flight path changes have
significantly disrupted life below with
relentless noise pollution.
As 400 flights per day cross over Be-
thesda at low altitudes, many of my
constituents are woken up in the mid-
dle of the night, others are interrupted
and distracted at work by the on-
slaught of noise, and there are children
complaining that they cannot hear
their teachers speak over the noise oc-
casionally caused by commercial jets
flying over their schools.
After more than 3 years of incessant
disturbance of their peace and quiet,
my constituents were stunned last
month when the FAA announced that
it would implement yet another change
to flight paths at Reagan National Air-
port that would lead to even more air
traffic over our communities. The FAA
casually announced the change slated
for an August 2019 implementation
date at a meeting with the Community
Noise Working Group that works with
FAA to address the problem of noise
pollution at Reagan National Airport.
Given the substantial consequences of
this change and the complete lack of
public input in its development, I urge
the FAA to delay the implementation
date and to engage seriously with our
Community Noise Working Group,
which is eager to evaluate the proposed
changes and work towards alternative
proposals or strategies to avert or at
least mitigate the impact.
It is my hope, Mr. Chairman, that
with the $17.7 billion that this bill ap-
propriates to the FAA, the agency will
take serious steps toward dramatically
reducing the noise pollution in residen-
tial areas in my district, in Mont-
gomery, and throughout the Nation.
Thank you, Chairman PRICE, for your
indulgence.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I want to thank our col-
league from Maryland for highlighting
this issue of aviation noise and the
need for the FAA to be responsive to
community concerns.
Noise we know is an unfortunate and
unpleasant side effect of the invest-
ments, the jobs, and the mobility
gained from aviation service. We re-
ceived numerous requests about noise
from colleagues this year, and we un-
derscore the FAA should make every
feasible effort to assist airports, air-
lines, and local communities mitigate
noise for the health and benefit of
those affected.
Mr. Chair, I thank our colleague for
raising this issue, and I yield back the
balance of my time.

AMENDMENT NO. 241 OFFERED BY MR. HECK
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 241 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. HECK. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 582, line 9, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(increased by $5,000,000)’’.
Page 584, line 8, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(increased by $5,000,000)’’.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Washington (Mr. HECK) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Washington.
Mr. HECK. Mr. Chair, I yield myself
such time as I may consume.
My amendment is about creating eco-
nomic opportunities in Indian Country.
It is about improving housing condi-
tions, creating jobs, and helping Native
communities meet their community
development needs.
It is a bipartisan amendment, and it
provides an additional $5 million for
the Indian Community Development
Block Grant program, which is one of
the most flexible, most competitive
grant programs of its kind and, might
I add, one of the most effective.
Frankly, I was disappointed to see
the President’s budget request attempt
to eliminate the program, especially
when the problem statement associated
with the need to increase our invest-
ment in infrastructure is so clear.
I have said it before, and I will say it
again here today: We are in the middle
of a housing crisis, in large part be-
cause we simply do not have enough
homes.
While it is true that housing short-
ages exist across the country, nowhere
is the issue more pronounced than it is
in Native American communities. Na-
tive Americans experience worse hous-
ing conditions and a higher incidence
of homelessness than nearly every
other demographic.
One of the most important duties I
have as a Member of Congress is ensur-
ing the sovereignty of the four Tribes
in my district that I have the privilege
to represent, as well as the 29 Tribes in
my State, and to help them as they
work to provide better opportunities
for Tribal members.
That is our Federal trust responsi-
bility. Cutting this program violates
that trust responsibility. I urge my
colleagues to join me in supporting the
Indian Community Development Block
Grant program and, in doing so, sup-
porting the many Native American
communities who will benefit from it.
Finally, I thank my colleagues, Rep-
resentatives DON YOUNG, GWEN MOORE,
JARED HUFFMAN, DEB HAALAND, and
TULSI GABBARD, for joining me in offer-
ing this bipartisan amendment.
I also sincerely thank Chairman
PRICE and his staff for putting together
such a comprehensive appropriations
package that funds our Nation’s vital
transportation and housing programs.
Mr. Chair, I urge the adoption of this
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I
claim the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Florida is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I

Mr. HECK. Mr. Chair, I yield to the
gentleman from North Carolina.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I rise to support this amend-
ment.
The Indian Community Development
Block Grant program provides Indian
Tribes and Alaska Native Villages the
opportunity to compete for a flexible
source of funding to address pressing
housing and community needs in In-
dian Country.
We know the needs continue to ex-
ceed the funding available. In fiscal
year 2017, HUD was able to fund only 62
percent of the eligible applications it
received. That is why we provided in
the bill $75 million, a $10 million in-
crease over last year, for the program.
This amendment would further in-
crease that to $80 million.

and the strong investment it would

make possible, but I do want to express
a note of concern about the offsetting
cuts to HUD’s Cybersecurity and Infor-
mation Technology Fund.
HUD is facing daunting challenges to
upgrade its technology infrastructure.
As we head into conference negotia-
tions with the Senate, I am hopeful we
can reach a comprehensive, bipartisan
agreement that makes it possible to
boost funding both for critical housing
programs and for IT modernization at
HUD.
Again, I urge adoption of the gentle-
man’s amendment.
Mr. HECK. Mr. Chair, I thank the
chair of the subcommittee, again, very
much.
It seems to me that often around
here, we have solutions in search of
problems. That is absolutely not the
case in this instance. The problem
statement here is clear. It is screaming
in its need and the depth of the need.
As a consequence, again, I thank the
chair of the subcommittee and the bi-
partisan cosponsors of this amend-
ment.
Mr. Chair, I urge its adoption, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 244 OFFERED BY MR. GROTHMAN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 244 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, there is
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division E (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. Each amount made available by
this division (other than an amount required
to be made available by a provision of law) is
hereby reduced by 4.6 percent.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Wisconsin.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I guess
there is a series of amendments like
this.
It is well known that we have a huge
deficit out here. Obviously, one way to
deal with a deficit is to make sure that
the appropriations bills are not exces-
sive.
We are approaching borrowing 20 per-
cent of the Federal budget. That is just
almost beyond belief.
We just got done with an amendment
in which some people out there felt we
weren’t spending enough on commu-
nity block grants, which is appalling. I
am much more in line with President
Trump’s opinion of that. I don’t think
we should be increasing things at this
time.
This amendment is a modest amend-
ment. Rather than having decreases—
which, of course, we should have—we
are taking a 4.6 percent across-the-
board cut on this overall provision.
I realize it touches a variety of pro-
grams. We are still allowing a 2 percent
increase. Quite frankly, I think a 2 per-
cent increase here is more than
enough, but what I do here is I propose
a 4.6 percent across-the-board reduc-
tion.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I strongly oppose this amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from North Carolina is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, this amendment indiscrimi-
nately cuts programs in transportation
and housing with, apparently, very lit-
tle thought as to the relative merit of
the programs contained in the bill.
The amendment would result in less
affordable housing and less support for
Habitat for Humanity, public housing,
homeless veterans, housing, the elder-
ly, the disabled, and the Department of
Transportation and its agencies re-
sponsible for the safety of our roads,
our bridges, our aviation, our pipelines,
and our waterways.
It would reduce funds available to
pay the bills submitted by State and
local governments for their transpor-
tation programs. These programs are
the legal responsibility of the Federal
Government.
The base bill enables us to continue
to make progress in restoring our in-
frastructure. This amendment would
roll that back.
This amendment would not encour-
age DOT or HUD to do more with less.
It would force them to do less with
less.
Our colleague describes this as a
modest amendment. Well, let me just
ask how modest these cuts are for his
home State of Wisconsin.
Mr. Chair, is $3.1 million for CDBG
funding, which could have been used to
rehabilitate housing or improve water
mains and sewers, a modest cut?
$12.4 million in Wisconsin funding for
CDBG dollars, the money that would be
generated, is that modest?
Or is $1.5 million in HOME funding in
Wisconsin, $1.8 million in funding for
transit in Wisconsin, or $1.3 million in
funding for highway infrastructure in
Wisconsin?
Our colleague may want to inquire
back home as to how modest those cuts
are.
The amendment is particularly gall-
ing since the gentleman voted for the
2017 tax bill, a $1.5 trillion tax cut,
most of which went to the top 1 per-
cent.
He is concerned about the deficit.
That tax bill alone adds $1.9 trillion to
our deficit from 2018 to 2027.
Why is it more important to give tax
cuts to the wealthy than it is to build
affordable housing and other infra-
structure like roads and bridges that
all of our citizens need and that they
benefit from? It doesn’t make sense.
Mr. Chair, I strongly urge Members
to oppose this damaging and indis-
criminate amendment, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I didn’t
come here to debate the tax cut, but I
will point out one more time that the
Republicans who voted against the tax
cut did so at the request of the wealthi-
er taxpayers in given States who felt
that the tax cut unnecessarily didn’t
help the wealthier members of society.
As far as the other things that were
rattled off, the State of Wisconsin
right now is running a significant sur-
plus, unlike the Federal Government
that continues to borrow substantially.
Fiscally, if anybody should be increas-
ing spending on these programs, it
should be the States, not the Federal
Government.
Not to mention our Constitution—
the gentleman rattles off a lot of
things that really have nothing to do
with interstate commerce and nothing
to do with the Federal Government. We
not only should be not increasing these
programs, but we should be cutting
them.
Again, my amendment still allows a 2
percent increase. When I go back home
and explain it to the folks, I think the
major thing they will be saying is,
‘‘GROTHMAN, why are you so generous
as to give a 2 percent increase?’’
I have no problem saying this amend-
ment is responsible. On the floor, I will
probably wind up voting for other
amendments that have greater reduc-
tions than this.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, as to the tax cut, I will simply
quote very reliable figures from the
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities:
The top 1 percent of the population re-
ceived 34 percent of the benefits of the
tax cut.
As to the constitutional point, if I
hear that correctly, the point is that
these programs should be eliminated.
Constitutionality raises the issue as to
whether this should, perhaps, be zero
funding, as opposed to these indiscrimi-
nate cuts that would do so much dam-
age to the State of Wisconsin and to
the entire country.
Mr. Chair, I urge opposition of the
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I have
nothing more to add, and I yield back
the balance of my time.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Illinois.
Mr. BOST. Mr. Chair, the purpose of
my amendment is to put the House on
record in support of strengthening
HUD’s oversight of public housing.
Many of my colleagues may have
never heard of Cairo, Illinois, or what
took place at the Alexander County
Housing Authority, but they should.
An investigation by The Southern Il-
linoisan newspaper discovered a public
housing agency plagued with corrup-
tion and mismanagement.
Residents lived in unsafe, unsanitary
conditions, with mold, rodents, and
broken air ducts that allowed for the
creation of black mold—public housing
that was not suitable for any human
being to live in. The problem was so
bad that many of the buildings had to
be demolished.
b 1645
Residents were forced to move far
from Cairo.
All the while, the housing
authority’s senior leadership was cash-
ing in. Officials received excessive pay
and benefits, large pensions, lavish
travel expenses, and a big consulting
contract for a former director; all of
this paid for with taxpayer money.
These problems did not occur over-
night. It took decades of corruption
and neglect. The Federal regulators
were asleep at the switch. Despite the
terrible living conditions, HUD inspec-
tors gave a passing grade to the Alex-
ander Housing Authority on several oc-
casions.
HUD failed to properly audit the fi-
nancials. If they did, they would have
taken action before conditions became
a crisis.
Last year, HUD Office of Inspector
General issued a report on failures in
Alexander County. The report included
four specific recommendations on im-
provement to the agency’s regulations
of public housing.
The House Committee on Financial
Services conducted a hearing on this
report. I testified as a witness. I was
glad to see the bipartisan outrage
which occurred about the situation
that occurred in Cairo.
More recently, the HUD Inspector
General issued a report on the specific
criminal actions of Alexander County
Housing Authority leadership. Charges
have been filed against these officials.
Unfortunately, it comes too late for
most residents of the housing author-
ity.
But we can stop this from happening
again. The purpose of my amendment
is for HUD to implement the OIG im-
provements.
In addition, it is my hope that the
House Financial Services Committee
continue its work to conduct oversight
of public housing agencies. What hap-
pened in Alexander County may be the
most extreme outcome, but it is not
the only one of these types of issues
that are occurring around this Nation
today.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I am prepared to claim the
time in opposition, although I am not
opposed to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5
minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I want to strongly support
this amendment and commend the gen-
tleman for offering it. He is high-
lighting horrible conditions with the
situation in Alexander County, Illinois.
HUD’s IG has concluded that HUD
should have done more to oversee this
decades-long situation, these deterio-
rating conditions at the Alexander
County Housing Authority and has
made multiple recommendations to ad-
dress the situation and to ensure that
something like this doesn’t recur.
In fiscal year 2018, our House THUD
report requested that HUD work with
the community to find adequate hous-
ing for displaced residents, and to
quickly investigate the root causes of
the situation.
The base bill, I am happy to say, does
fund the IG account above the request
level, partly to help with work on this
issue. And we have also increased fund-
ing in the Public Housing Operating
and Capital Funds to provide more re-
sources to public housing authorities
for capital improvements and better
management.
Mr. Chairman, we are continuing to
monitor this situation. We expect HUD
to implement the Inspector General’s
recommendations as quickly as pos-
sible. So I urge adoption of the amend-
ment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. BOST. Mr. Chair, I thank the
chairman for his support of the amend-
ment. With this, it is our hope that
things like what happened in Alex-
ander County will not happen again;
that proper oversight will be given.
The effect that this has on people’s
lives is tremendous, and anyone that
has worked with these situations
knows and understands.
I appreciate the fact that my col-
league, the chairman, supports this,
and I ask for my colleagues’ support.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.

Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chairman, here we
go again. Another bloated spending
deal that doesn’t just bust the spending
caps but spends more than ever before
on this division. With a $22 trillion na-
tional debt, you would think my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle
would show a little restraint.
My friends on the other side of the
aisle, who I have enormous respect for,
including the chairman, are proposing
to spend $137.1 billion in this division
alone, which is $6 billion more than
last year’s enacted level.
Mr. Chairman, we simply can’t con-
tinue to go down this path. While both
parties have contributed to Washing-
ton’s $22 trillion national debt, my col-
leagues are recklessly proposing to
bust the budget caps, trigger sequestra-
tion, and continue to mortgage our
children’s future. At some point, we
have got to do something to confront
this town’s spending addiction.
I acknowledge that reducing our na-
tional debt is a daunting challenge, and
I am prepared to debate today how to
best accomplish the goal of a balanced
budget. But my friends on the other
side of the aisle do not even want to
have that discussion.
Hoosier families in my district have
these tough talks every day around
their kitchen table. Why can’t Wash-
ington, D.C., do the same?
With these spending packages threat-
ening to bust the budget caps and ini-
tiate sequestration, there appears to be
an indifference from my Democrat col-
leagues as to the severe harm that this
poses to our national security.
I will not be silent about this, Mr.
Chairman. This is my seventh time
coming to this microphone offering the
same amendment in the last couple of
weeks alone. I am looking forward to
having a substantive debate today
about this particular amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5061
June 24, 2019
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I rise in opposition to the
amendment.
The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I suppose if you liked a 4.6
percent across-the-board, indiscrimi-
nate cut, you will love 14 percent, even
more draconian, and equally indis-
criminate.
I won’t repeat what I said a few min-
utes ago about the drastic effects a cut
of this magnitude would have on the
range of housing and transportation
priorities for this country. But I will
look at a particular State, the gentle-
man’s own State, Indiana, and just
mention what some of the con-
sequences would be. I hope this is use-
ful information.
The gentleman’s amendment would
cut $10.2 million in CDBG funding for
Indiana, which could have been used to
rehab housing, to repair streets and
sidewalks, provide senior and youth
programs. The amount of additional
funding generated by CDBG dollars in
Indiana is estimated to be—the cut, the
effect is estimated to be $40.6 million
in money taken out of the Indiana
economy.
Home funding, the most flexible af-
fordable housing funding we have, $4.8
million taken out of that funding in In-
diana.
Transit projects in Indiana take a
whopping loss of $23.8 million.
Highways in Indiana, highway infra-
structure, a loss of $5.1 million; and so
it goes.
These are cuts that would reverse the
progress we have made.
A lot of people are talking infrastruc-
ture these days, including our Presi-
dent. This bill is actually doing some-
thing about it. We are making long
overdue investments in this country’s
infrastructure, and that includes the
housing infrastructure.
Yet, colleagues who—I don’t know
what they have said about this as a na-
tional priority. Certainly, if they offer
an amendment like this, or vote for an
amendment like this, they are march-
ing back down the hill in terms of the
progress we have made and hope to
make.
So this amendment, I would think,
has very little to recommend it for any
Member who wishes to invest in our
country’s future, and I urge its rejec-
tion.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chairman, a very
wise former Governor of Indiana once
said that you will never know how
much government you will never miss.
And these days, as we roll out spending
package after spending package that
spends more and more than ever spent
before, I look back to those wise words
of that former governor, because that
former Governor, knew, just as I do, as
a former State Legislator, that the
States can always run these programs
and do better with running govern-
ment, administering programs like
these than the Federal Government
ever can.
And while there is a difference of
opinion between my colleague, again,
who I respect and admire so much, it is
clear that there is a difference of opin-
ion between those who believe that
Washington, D.C., should tax more
hard-earned tax dollars out of the
pockets of hardworking Hoosier fami-
lies, just so that Washington, D.C., can
spend more and more on spending
packages just like these.
In closing, Mr. Chairman, President
Ronald Reagan once said: ‘‘We don’t
have a trillion-dollar debt because we
haven’t taxed enough; we have a tril-
lion-dollar debt because we spend too
much.’’
Since then, we have added roughly
$21 trillion to our Nation’s debt. This
simply cannot go on. If we do not begin
to tackle this challenge now, it will be
tackled for us by our creditors.
We need to learn from the common-
sense words of President Reagan and
start to live within our means today. If
we don’t, we will be putting our troops
at a disadvantage and our national se-
curity at risk because of sequestration
and leave for our children a country
with less freedom and less opportunity
than the one that we inherited. That is
unacceptable to me, and I plan to fight
to prevent that future from becoming a
reality. I urge my colleagues’ support
for this amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. BANKS).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chairman, I demand
a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Indiana will be
postponed.
It is now in order to consider amend-
ment No. 253 printed in part B of House
Report 116–119.
AMENDMENT NO. 258 OFFERED BY MR. VARGAS
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 258 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Chairman, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division E (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. 422. None of the funds made available
by this division may be used to deny eligi-
bility of a single family mortgage for insur-
ance under title II of the National Housing
Act on the basis of the status of the mort-
gagor as an alien in deferred action status
pursuant to the Deferred Action for Child-
hood Arrivals (‘DACA’) Program announced
by the Secretary of Homeland Security on
June 15, 2012.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from California (Mr. VARGAS) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Until recently, recipients of the De-
ferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or
DACA program, have been able to se-
cure mortgage insurance from the Fed-
eral Housing Administration, or FHA.
In 2018, lenders began reporting to
news sources such as, HousingWire and
BuzzFeed, that officials from the De-
partment of Housing and Urban Devel-
opment had informed them that DACA
recipients were not eligible for FHA in-
surance.
HUD’s conflicting responses to public
inquiries on the matter left uncer-
tainty in the market over the past
year. Then HUD sent a letter to Rep-
resentative PETE AGUILAR 2 weeks ago
confirming they had stopped providing
FHA insurance for DACA recipients’
mortgages.
b 1700
DACA recipients are individuals liv-
ing in the U.S. under the Deferred Ac-
tion for Childhood Arrivals, DACA,
program. They were brought to the
United States as children. They were
children.
As individuals even within this ad-
ministration have expressed, the
United States is the only place many of
them know. It is their home.
DACA recipients are taxpayers, stu-
dents, teachers, and soldiers. They are
our neighbors. They contribute to our
economy and are pillars of our commu-
nities. Yet, individuals now seek to
deny DACA recipients access to owning
a home.
Our government insures mortgages
through FHA to help low- and middle-
income individuals buy a home. This
program allowed DACA recipients to
buy their first homes. HUD’s move to
deny these young people access to Fed-
eral insurance has already blocked peo-
ple from homeownership.
That is why my colleague, Represent-
ative PETE AGUILAR, and I have offered
the amendment here today. This
amendment simply prohibits HUD from
using funds to deny DACA recipients
access to FHA-insured mortgages.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support the amendment and provide
these individuals with access to home-
ownership.
Mr. Chair, I yield as much time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
California (Mr. AGUILAR).
Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentleman from California (Mr.
VARGAS) for his advocacy for decades
on behalf of immigrants and his com-
munity.
It has been nearly 2 years since the
Trump administration arbitrarily
ended the DACA program, throwing the
lives of these thousands of young peo-
ple into turmoil. Despite bipartisan ef-
forts to provide Dreamers with a path

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5062 June 24, 2019
to citizenship and the certainty that
they deserve, the Trump administra-
tion has done all it can to block
progress on this issue.
Earlier this year, we learned about
Republicans’ latest efforts to deny
these young immigrants access to the
American Dream. For years, FHA-
backed loans have made it possible for
borrowers with little savings and a low
downpayment to become homeowners,
giving young families a chance at
building generational wealth.
This critical resource helps to build
our middle class, invigorates local
economies, and gives families security
to control their own future. Under the
Trump administration, HUD has in-
structed lenders to deny this oppor-
tunity to DACA recipients by declaring
them ineligible for FHA-backed home
loans.
Let me be clear: This new and cruel
policy shift takes away a key tool to
help Dreamers succeed in this country,
allowing the President’s anti-immi-
grant agenda to seep into our Nation’s
housing policy.
DACA recipients are every bit as
American as anyone in this Chamber
today. They grew up in this country.
They have started businesses and ca-
reers in this country. They are raising
families in this country. If our govern-
ment will not take the necessary steps
to allow them to live freely as citizens
in this country, the least we can do is
to make sure that they will be success-
ful here.
That is why I am proud to support
the amendment by Mr. VARGAS, which
would give Dreamers the opportunity
to use FHA-backed loans to become
homeowners and to build their futures
in the only country that they have ever
known.
Mr. Chair, again, I thank Mr. VARGAS
for this amendment.
Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I
claim the time in opposition to the
amendment, even though I am not op-
posed to it.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. TONKO).
Without objection, the gentleman from
Florida is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, again,
I want to first thank Mr. VARGAS, not
for this amendment, but for his leader-
ship and for his support of immigrants.
He has done that for many, many
years, and I thank him for that. But I
want to make some things clear.
There is no DACA policy related to
FHA-backed mortgages. As a matter of
fact, there has been no change in pol-
icy. FHA’s published policy states that
non-U.S. citizens without formal lawful
residency are not eligible for FHA-in-
sured loans.
Again, this is not a new policy. This
was the policy during the previous ad-
ministration. This was the policy when
Secretary Castro was Secretary of
HUD. It has been in place since the pre-
vious administration. There has been
no change.
Mr. Chair, obviously, I don’t question
the motives of the gentleman, whom I
have great respect for, and I once again
thank him for his concern on this
issue. If I have some concern, it is the
fact that this may let some people be-
lieve, those folks out there who are
DACA recipients, that, all of a sudden,
they have this new protection, which
this amendment does not give them.
Mr. Chair, I have no real objection
other than to the fact that this really
doesn’t do anything. But I do appre-
ciate my friend for his years of leader-
ship and of care. Again, I don’t have a
real objection. This amendment just
doesn’t do anything.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Chair, I do thank
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DIAZ-
BALART) for his kind words. I appre-
ciate my good friend.
Mr. Chair, I yield as much time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. PRICE).
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I am happy to strongly support
this amendment, and I thank my col-
leagues for offering it.
I want to make a comment on what
is going on over at HUD. Secretary
Carson assured our committee that
Dreamers were not being denied FHA
loans, that there was no change to the
policy, no plan to change the policy.
Now, HUD has confirmed that FHA will
no longer make loans available to
Dreamers.
This is the latest in what is becoming
a disturbing pattern of HUD telling
Congress one thing and then doing an-
other. They haven’t been forthcoming,
to say the least, on this issue.
This amendment reverses that deci-
sion, that HUD decision that would ef-
fectively block a key part of the Amer-
ican Dream, homeownership, to this
population.
Dreamers are already in limbo, Mr.
Chair. Let’s not make these young peo-
ple pay a further price for our failure
to act.
Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues for
the amendment and urge its adoption.
Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Chair, again, I
urge my colleagues to support this
amendment. I thank the gentleman
from North Carolina, the gentleman
from California, and, again, my friend
from Florida for their comments.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I
want to add what I said before, that
there has been no change in policy.
This was the same policy that was
there during the previous administra-
tion. Again, that does not take away
my great respect for the gentleman
who is introducing this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Chair, I would just
close with saying this: Remember,
these are children who were brought to
the United States through no decision
of their own. It was their parents’.
So many of us have children, and
they don’t get to make their own deci-
sions. We make the decisions when
they are children on where they go,
where they live.
Mr. Chair, let’s show some heart.
Let’s show some love to these young
people and allow them to pursue the
American Dream. I urge its support.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. VARGAS).
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I rise as the designee of Chair-
woman NITA LOWEY, and I move to
strike the last word.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for the pur-
pose of entering into a colloquy.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, let
me thank the gentleman from North
Carolina (Mr. PRICE) and let me thank
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.
LOWEY) for their kindness. I wish to
enter into a colloquy with the distin-
guished gentleman.
Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman PRICE
for the assistance and resources he has
helped direct to my home State of
Texas in the aftermath of Hurricane
Harvey and for his commitment to re-
vitalizing the Nation’s infrastructure
in a way that preserves our Nation’s
cultural heritage.
In 1966, President Lyndon Johnson
signed into law the landmark National
Historic Preservation Act, which,
among other things, established the
National Register of Historic Places.
Independence Heights is just one of
the dozens of communities throughout
the United States that can trace its be-
ginning to freed slaves. Since its begin-
ning in 1915, it has survived economic
hardship and natural disasters in the
period of 1919 to 1921 called the burn-
ings.
Because of its historical significance,
Independence Heights is included in
legislation I have introduced, H.R. 434,
that will create the Emancipation Na-
tional Historic Trail, which begins at
the location in Galveston, Texas, where
General Gordon Granger announced
President Lincoln’s emancipation of
slaves on June 19, 1865.
Mr. Chair, I would inquire of the
chairman if he agrees with me that the
requirements of the National Historic
Preservation Act and NEPA regarding
the environment apply with respect to
USDOT approval of the I–45 Highway
project that may adversely impact his-
toric buildings and neighborhoods in
Independence Heights, Texas, which, in
1915, became the first African Amer-
ican municipality incorporated in

assessing whether Federal support of
the I–45 transportation project com-
plies with the requirements of the Na-
tional Historic Preservation Act and
NEPA?
Mr. Chair, will the gentleman work
with me to ensure that the approval
process for this I–45 transportation
project in my congressional district is
conducted in a manner that complies
with the law and preserves to the max-
imum extent feasible historic sites in
Independence Heights, in compliance
with NEPA, that have national, State,
and local historic significance for the
Nation?
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I thank my colleague from
Texas for those questions, which high-
light the issue of historic preservation
and NEPA review.
As part of its evaluation and ap-
proval process, the Department of
Transportation must consider the ef-
fects of proposed projects on areas of
historical significance. Under the law,
the Department must make an assess-
ment of any effects of a project on his-
toric properties and evaluate options
to avoid, minimize, and mitigate nega-
tive effects. This assessment must be
completed in consultation with State
and local partners, as well as civic and
community leaders.
Mr. Chair, I look forward to working
with the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.
JACKSON LEE) on issues of historic pres-
ervation.
Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Texas for any comments
she might have.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I
thank the gentleman very much.
Mr. Chair, thank you, Chairman PRICE, for
the assistance and resources you helped di-
rect to my home state of Texas in the after-
math of Hurricane Harvey, and for your com-
mitment to revitalizing the nation’s infrastruc-
ture in a way that preserves our nation’s cul-
tural heritage.
In 1966, President Lyndon Johnson signed
into law the landmark National Historic Preser-
vation Act, which, among other things, estab-
lished the National Register of Historic Places.
Independence Heights is just one of dozens
of communities throughout the United States
that can trace its beginning to freed slaves
and since its beginning in 1915 it has survived
economic hardship, natural disasters, and the
period of 1919–1921 called the ‘‘Burnings.’’
Because of its historical significance, Inde-
pendence Heights is included in legislation I
have introduced (H.R. 434) that will create the
Emancipation National Historic Trail which be-
gins at the location in Galveston, Texas,
where General Gordon Granger announced
President Lincoln’s Emancipation of slaves on
June 19, 1865.
Mr. Chair, may I ask how much time
is remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from North Carolina has 1 minute and
35 seconds remaining.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I
thank the gentleman very much. If I
might, I would like to thank the chair-
man again for an amendment that in-
creases and decreases by $10 million
funds for the National Infrastructure
Investment Account to provide funding
for urban bicycle and pedestrian safety
programs.
Let me say that, tragically, we lost a
brilliant young man on May 30, 2019, at
the intersection of North Shepherd
Drive and West 10th Street in the 18th
Congressional District. When Lesha
White was driving, it was Jesus
‘‘Jesse’’ Perez who was struggling to
cross the intersection, and this caused
him to lose his life.
Let me also indicate that we know
that, in Houston, there are 2,000 deaths
of bicyclists and pedestrians. We would
like to make sure that we increase op-
portunities for safety.
Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman and
the Rules Committee for this amend-
ment being made in order.
According to TxDOT, 1,400 Houston
area pedestrians are injured, and 275 of
them are injured seriously.
We hope that this will work for both
pedestrians and bicyclists. Bicycling in
Houston has taken off in the State of
Texas and everywhere, and we cer-
tainly want to make sure that they are
safe.
Mr. Chair, let me also thank the gen-
tleman for an amendment that gives $2
million for the Office of Inspector Gen-
eral account to investigate the Depart-
ment of HUD’s delay in releasing $4 bil-
lion in Hurricane Harvey disaster com-
munity block grant dollars.
We are still desperate. Every day,
people ask me when their homes are
going to be able to be fixed. We do
know that we are working to move
that along, but we know what is impor-
tant is to make sure that those dollars
get to those individuals and that we
can restore our communities.
We are going into hurricane season
again, and I thought it was very impor-
tant that we work strongly to ensure
that these citizens are made whole.
Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for
including them in the en bloc and for
allowing Houston to stand up again
after a devastating hurricane, Hurri-
cane Harvey.
Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the
desk; it is listed in the Rule as Jackson Lee
#243.
I wish to thank Chairman MCGOVERN and
Ranking Member COLE of the Rules Com-
mittee for making this Jackson Lee Amend-
ment in order.
I thank Chairwoman PRICE and Ranking
Member DIAZ-BALART for their hard work in
bringing Division E, the Transportation Hous-
ing and Urban Development portion of this
omnibus appropriations legislative package, to
the floor.
I thank them all for this opportunity to ex-
plain the Jackson Lee Amendment, which
makes a good bill even better by providing $2
million to an effort to explain why the Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Development has
not released the funds appropriated almost
two years ago to the State of Texas, the City
of Houston and Harris County to rebuild fol-
lowing Hurricane Harvey.
In August of 2017, Hurricane Harvey para-
lyzed the Houston region dumping nearly 60
inches of rain, claiming 88 lives and causing
$113 billion of damage.
In February of 2018, Congress appropriated
$4.383 billion to Texas through CDBG-DR
funds. In June of 2018, HUD approved the
State Action Plan Texas submitted by The
General Land Office (GLO), which outlined
how the CD BG-DR grants would be distrib-
uted throughout the state.
This money still has not made it to Texas to
help those in need.
While the waters receded nearly two years
ago, many Texans are still struggling to put
their lives back together and rebuild.
Homes and neighborhoods remain with visi-
ble damage from the flood waters.
I, along with members of the Texas House
and Senate Delegations have made numerous
requests to HUD Officials to move the process
of releasing funding forward, but without suc-
cess.
The last resort left is to seek the assistance
of the Inspector General of HUD to determine
the cause of the delay in distributing funds
and to determine what needs to be done to re-
lease the funds.
The mission of the Office of Inspector Gen-
eral (OIG) is to prevent and detect fraud,
waste, and abuse in the programs and oper-
ations of HUD by conducting independent au-
dits, evaluations, and investigations.
The OIG can get answers on why the proc-
ess of releasing funds is taking so long and
whether there is any waste, fraud or abuse as-
sociated with the delay.
Hurricane Harvey was the most economi-
cally destructive hurricane to hit Texas in its
history and the second-most expensive hurri-
cane in American history.
Hurricane Harvey and the resulting flood im-
pacted over 1,000 square miles along the mid-
to-upper Texas Gulf Coast, and into the
state’s interior.
Congress immediately recognized the vast
extent of the damage throughout the state and
that federal action would be needed to help
Texas start to rebuild and recover.
Finally, it would be beneficial to Congress to
know if there are other factors within the agen-
cy that may be hindering effective administra-
tion of the duty to distribute the Harvey Dis-
aster Block Grant Development funds such as
agency vacancies, skills and competence of
personnel, or administration policy that may be
contributing factors.
As the lead state agency for administering
CDBG-DR funds, GLO entered into an agree-
ment with HUD and has worked closely with
the agency to define the meaning of mitigation
and to identify projects that would best help
those impacted by Hurricane Harvey.
Despite the collaboration between the GLO
and HUD, the rules have not yet been pub-
lished in the Federal Register.
As a result, the GLO has been significantly
delayed in implementing a State Action Plan
for the funds, the critical next step needed be-
fore the grants can get to those who need
them.
I ask my colleagues to support this Jackson
Lee Amendment that may pave the way for
the funding appropriated in 2017 to reach
those still in need of disaster recovery assist-
ance.
Additionally, funding is needed to make the
needed changes to the intersections to im-
prove pedestrian and bicyclists safety.
We must come together to tackle this prob-
lem and work to ensure that we stem the tide
in these fatalities.

The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order

Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chair, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division E (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. 422. None of the funds made available
by this division may be used in contraven-
tion of section 2635.702 of title 5, Code of Fed-
eral Regulations.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI) and

Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of
amendment No. 267 and in support of
H.R. 3055, legislation that includes ro-
bust funding for the Department of
Transportation.
Simply put, H.R. 3055 will bolster our
infrastructure and increase the safety
and security for citizens across the
country, and I am proud to support it.
But, Mr. Chair, when we use billions of
dollars in taxpayer money to invest in
our infrastructure, our constituents
are relying on us to do so in a manner
that is fair, transparent, and ethical.
That is why I am introducing, today,
amendment No. 267, which would pro-
hibit any funding in the appropriations
bill from being used in violation of sec-
tion 2635.702 of title 5, which is the law
mandating that no public office be used
for private gain.
In light of recent reporting alleging
potential misconduct by the Secretary
of the Department of Transportation,
it is imperative that we remind Federal
officials that public money cannot be
used for private purposes. Government
officials across agencies should not
make policy decisions with the intent
of benefiting family businesses. They
should never use their position in an
official capacity to promote their own
personal financial interests, and when
tasked with any decision where there
are potential conflicts of interest, they
must recuse themselves.
Government officials should make
decisions only for the public good, not
private gain. Favoritism corrodes trust
in government and in the vital institu-
tions that have kept our democracy
strong for over 200 years. For these rea-
sons, I urge my colleagues to support
this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. DIAZ BALART. Mr. Chair, I
claim the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Florida is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. DIAZ BALART. Mr. Chair, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chair, I
yield to the gentleman from North
Carolina (Mr. PRICE).
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I am pleased to rise in sup-
port of this amendment and commend
my colleague and a number of col-
leagues, actually, for offering it.
The recent news reports about the
Secretary of Transportation are dis-
turbing. It is critical that anyone who
serves in public office follows the law,
and if the law clearly states you can’t
use your public office for personal gain,
that is what following the law requires.
We expect all Federal employees to fol-
low the law, and this amendment re-
minds them that it is their obligation
to do so.
So I thank the gentleman again for
raising this issue.
Mr. Chair, I would urge adoption of
the amendment.
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chair, I
have no further speakers, and I urge
my colleagues to support this amend-
ment because we must operate in the
public interest, not for private gain, as
Federal employees and people in trust
in the Federal Government.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr.
KRISHNAMOORTHI).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 268 OFFERED BY MS. JAYAPAL
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order

in part B of House Report 116–119.
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chairman, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentlewoman
from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Washington.
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chairman, let me
first thank our Appropriations Com-
mittee chair, Mr. PRICE, as well as the
members of the Rules Committee for
making this amendment in order.
This is a budget-neutral amendment
that would increase the funds dedi-
cated to Federal homeless assistance
grants by $1 million. These grants fund
programs that have been shown to play
key roles in addressing homelessness.
In my hometown, for example, these
funds support providers like Catholic
Housing Services, which supports peo-
ple who are formerly homeless, and
like Plymouth Housing, which offers
housing using the highly effective evi-
dence-based permanent supportive
housing model.
In my district, Mr. Chairman, we
have 11,000 homeless folks, people who
are experiencing homelessness, and
they need help. We need more of these
programs across the country.
Across the country, neighbors are ex-
periencing homelessness and housing
instability, and that instability can
take many forms. It can be the veteran
sleeping under an overpass, the child
whose family is staying with friends
and relatives, the low-wage worker who
just can’t even earn enough to leave
the shelter, or the former foster youth
who bounces in and out of cheap mo-
tels.
Some of these forms of homelessness
are highly visible, others, like the
housing instability experienced by
families and by people living in rural
areas, are often much harder to see,
but every form of homelessness is deep-
ly harmful.
That housing instability harms chil-
dren’s health. Kids and families facing
housing instability had an almost 20
percent increased risk of hospitaliza-
tion. Being homeless exacerbates phys-
ical and mental health issues and
causes illness where, before, people had
been healthy. And women who are
unstably housed face high rates of rape
and sexual and physical violence.
This suffering is cruel and unneces-
sary, and it is preventable. We all lose
a piece of our humanity when we leave
our unhoused neighborhoods behind. I
hope we can do better with this amend-
ment.
Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman
from North Carolina (Mr. PRICE), our
distinguished subcommittee chairman.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman
for yielding and wish to express sup-
port for her amendment. I commend
her for offering it.
Our underlying bill provides $2.8 bil-
lion for HUD’s Homeless Assistance
Grants program. That is the highest
funding level in that program’s his-
tory. It includes more resources for
Emergency Solutions Grants to rapidly
rehouse and prevent homelessness, and
the bill includes targeted investments
for survivors of domestic violence and
for youth experiencing homelessness.
In addition, section 231 of the bill
creates a mechanism that allows HUD
to more readily use recaptured funds
from the small number of projects that

might not utilize their resources. We
expect this provision will give us an ad-
ditional $90 million to use as grantees
fight on the front lines to end home-
lessness.
So we have added resources. More
can and must be done, and our col-
league’s amendment reflects that re-
ality. We are going to pair this with
sustained investments in affordable
housing, and we are determined to re-
duce housing insecurity across the Na-
tion.
So I am proud of what our bill ac-
complishes in this area. I commend the
gentlewoman for her amendment addi-
tionally emphasizing our homeless
challenge, and I urge adoption of our
colleague’s amendment.
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield
back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

The question was taken; and the Act-

AMENDMENT NO. 273 OFFERED BY MS. WEXTON
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order

in part B of House Report 116–119.
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Chairman, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 468, line 15, after the first dollar
amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $7,000,000) (re-
duced by $7,000,000)’’.

House Resolution 445, the gentlewoman
from Virginia (Ms. WEXTON) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Virginia.
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Chairman, my
amendment provides $7 million for the
FAA to continue its work developing
the remote tower pilot program.
Remote towers are a simple but revo-
lutionary concept: Provide air traffic
control services from any location.
With remote tower technology, high-
definition cameras and other sensors
are installed in an airport and feed
video and data in real time to a remote
tower center.
Remote towers offer a promising new
way for the FAA and airports to ad-
dress air traffic without breaking the
bank, saving on construction and
maintenance costs that come with
building a traditional air traffic con-
trol tower.
In addition to these cost savings, re-
mote towers provide additional capa-
bilities beyond the out-of-the-window
view, such as integration of local
weather information, tracking moving
objects, and the overlay of radar and
surveillance information about an air-
craft.
Remote tower systems can outline
the edges of runways, taxiways, and
airport structure, enhance visibility in
fog, rain, and other adverse weather,
and incorporate infrared cameras to
provide night vision. The cameras can
be filtered to minimize glare on a
bright day or to add light when it is
difficult to see at sunrise or dusk or on
overcast days.
I am pleased that the first remote
tower in the system is undergoing test-
ing in my district at Leesburg Execu-
tive Airport. The project was launched
in 2014 to address the justified need for
an air traffic control tower. The air-
port has more than 100,000 operations
annually and is located in a complex
airspace just miles away from Dulles
International Airport.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I claim
the time in opposition, although I am
not opposed to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Pennsylvania
is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chair, I thank the
ranking member for the opportunity.
This amendment ensures adequate
funding for the purposes of instructing
the FAA to continue the remote tower
pilot program. Remote towers provide
air traffic control services through the
use of cameras and/or other instru-
ments that provide information to con-
trollers not in the same location. This
is an innovative way to provide ATC
services, significantly decreasing the
upfront costs of building a control
tower, and it reduces the annual oper-
ating and maintenance costs, espe-
cially where one remote tower provides
coverage for several small airports in
the vicinity.
A 2007 FAA study found that the
technology in a remote tower actually
improves surveillance capabilities at
night and in inclement weather condi-
tions. With more than 20,000 nontow-
ered U.S. airports missing out on the
benefits of an air traffic control tower,
including streamlined access, reduced
delays, and increased safety margins,
remote towers provide a cost-effective
way to enhance the safety and perform-
ance at these airports.
It is vital that we continue to sup-
port the FAA’s remote tower pilot pro-
gram allowing for innovative ways to
improve safety and reduce costs. I want
to thank the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia for her important amendment,
and I encourage my colleagues to vote
in favor of her amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield
to the gentleman from North Carolina
(Mr. PRICE).
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I
thank my colleague for yielding, and I
am happy to express support for her
amendment and for highlighting this
issue.
Remote towers can be a cost-effec-
tive way to provide additional safety
and operational benefits to the Na-
tional Air Space program. The under-
lying bill, in fact, includes report lan-
guage encouraging the FAA ‘‘to use re-
mote tower technology as a means to
enhance safety, reduce costs, and ex-
pand air traffic control services at
rural and small community airports.’’
I appreciate the gentlewoman’s lead-
ership on this issue. I urge adoption of
her well-considered amendment.
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Chairman, the Na-
tional Air Traffic Controllers Associa-
tion agrees it would be shortsighted
not to continue the remote tower pilot
program at this point. If funding is not
appropriated, the FAA’s activities re-
lated to certifying remote towers
would cease, and the valuable work
that has been done to understand the
technology, develop operations, train
controllers, and conduct safety anal-
ysis will be put on hold. In addition,
the FAA won’t have the resources to
install remote tower technology at
other airports and evaluate future sys-
tem improvements and innovations.
For these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment and
to continue advancement of remote
tower technology as a cost-effective al-
ternative for providing air traffic con-
trol services.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.

gentrification in both urban and rural
areas, leading to more equitable devel-
opment.
Without proper funding for planning,
poor land use decisions can often in-
crease the threat of displacement. Too
often, it is communities of color and
working-class families who suffer
most, like the 23,000 Hispanic and Afri-
can American residents who have left
the Logan Square neighborhood in my
district, as well as the Pilsen part of
my district in Chicago.
My amendment would provide a mod-
est increase to the funds available for
transit-oriented planning and design
and better provide access to jobs and
affordable housing in communities
across the U.S.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
on both sides of the aisle to support
this amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I
rise in opposition to the gentleman’s
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Florida is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman,
first, I understand what the gentleman
is trying to do, and I respect him for
that. But I think Chairman PRICE has
set the right threshold for BUILD plan-
ning grants.
More money going to planning could
potentially, frankly, mean less money
for infrastructure for actual projects.
That is particularly true if, as I fear,
when there is a top-line number agreed
to by the House, Senate, and the White
House, the number that Chairman
PRICE is going to have to work with
might be less than what he is working
with today, making his job a lot more
difficult.
Again, I understand what the gen-
tleman is trying to do. I have said it
publicly and I have said it privately: I
think Chairman PRICE has done a great
job and has got a good balance. There-
fore, even though I understand what
the gentleman is trying to do, I re-
spectfully have to oppose this amend-
ment.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Mr. Chair-
man, I just want to point out that bet-
ter planning could, in fact, save more
money that would be available for in-
frastructure and development.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.
PRICE), the chairman of the Appropria-
tions Subcommittee on Transpor-
tation, Housing and Urban Develop-
ment.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I thank my colleague for
yielding and for offering this amend-
ment.
Mr. Chairman, I am willing to accept
this amendment, take it to conference,
and work out what the most appro-
priate level of funding is.
I want to acknowledge strong sup-
port of this Chamber from both sides of
the aisle for the BUILD program. That
is the one discretionary program with-
in DOT that allows States and local
communities to seek funding for major
multi-modal transportation projects.
As our colleague has underscored,
technical assistance and planning sup-
port is often essential to that process,
especially for communities with more
limited resources or expertise.
These planning grants are important.
The underlying bill provides $15 mil-
lion for competitive grants for plan-
ning, preparation, and design. The
amendment sets that figure at $20 mil-
lion. These resources are going to lead
to increased investments in our com-
munities, they are going to create jobs,
and spur economic growth.
Mr. Chairman, I applaud the gentle-
man’s efforts to highlight the impor-
tance of planning grants, and I urge
adoption of the amendment.
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Mr. Chair-
man, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman,
again, after hearing the chairman, who
is always willing to work with col-
leagues—again, I just understand the
difficult task that he has ahead of him,
but it is an issue that, as the chairman
himself has said, he will continue to
work on and with that—I understand
where Mr. GARCÍA is coming from.
Also, I know that he understands that
this is a very difficult balance that the
chairman has to deal with. I look for-
ward to continuing to work with the
chairman.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

man, I urge colleagues on both sides of

a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New Jersey.
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chairman, my amendment in-
creases funding for the Low or No
Emission Grant Program by $6 million,
from $94 million to $100 million.
The program, as the name implies,
provides funding to State and local
governments for zero- and low-emission
transit bus programs.
Using funds from the first and second
round of the Volkswagen settlement,
my State of New Jersey has begun our
transition to electric transit and
school bus fleets. This program, and
others like it all across America, would
benefit greatly from additional funds
from the Low or No Emission Grant
Program.
The benefits to our country will be
profound.
First, we get reduced carbon emis-
sions. The Department of Transpor-
tation has estimated that each zero-
emission bus has reduced carbon emit-
ted to the atmosphere by 1,690 tons
over its 12-year lifespan, or the equiva-
lent of taking 27 cars off the road.
Second, we get healthier kids. Smog
from diesel buses drives up rates of
asthma with children and low-income
communities suffering the most.
Finally, it is good economics. While
electric buses cost more up front, with
their lower maintenance costs, they
save around $39,000 per year over their
lifetime, a savings to taxpayers of
more than $150,000 per bus.
So I hope my colleagues will agree
that this is a smart investment. It will
speed our transition to a clean energy
economy and it will do it in a fiscally
responsible way.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I
rise in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Florida is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I
don’t object at all to the program that
the gentleman is supporting with an
increase. I think he has mentioned
why, and I would agree with what he
has stated.
The problem that I have is not with
the program he is trying to increase.
The part that I object to is where the
cuts are coming from, where he is ob-
taining the money, and that is cuts to
transit bus and bus facilities.
We have had a lot of Members who
were supporting funding for transit bus
and bus facilities. I believe it is over a
dozen Members who have actually writ-
ten support letters for that program
that this amendment, unfortunately,
reduces funding from. That provides
vital resources and mobility in urban
areas. It is crucial to a number of
urban areas around the country.
So, as I said before in other amend-
ments, I think Chairman PRICE has
struck the right balance in deter-
mining funding for this program. I
think what the gentleman is trying to
do in his amendment is meritorious. I
would, however, say that taking it out
of transit bus money and bus facility
money is not the place to do it. Obvi-
ously, I know that Chairman PRICE will
continue to work with the gentleman
as the process goes along, regardless of
what happens with this amendment.

Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-

Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. PRICE).
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I thank my colleague for
yielding and I wish to support his
amendment, particularly to stress the
emphasis he has given to low- and no-
emission buses. They do improve the
environment. They improve public
health, they reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and air pollution, and also
reduce long-term maintenance costs
for transit.
Our bill provides robust funding for
these grants to State and local govern-
ments of $145 million. That is $94 mil-
lion above the authorized amount.
Meanwhile, we are offering strong
support for the bus and bus facilities
program. That provides vital resources
that improve bus fleets in communities
large and small. Between the transit
infrastructure grants and funding pro-
vided via trust funds, the bill provides
$678 million in competitive grants
under that program.
These are both important programs
for transit grantees. I look forward to
working with my colleague to ensure
robust funding in public transit.
Mr. Chairman, I urge the amend-
ment’s adoption.
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Chairman, I
would add that we are not reducing the
grants available for bus programs in
this country. We are simply recog-
nizing that there is a transition under
way in our economy, a transition to
clean energy. We want to speed that
transition and we want to make sure
that America leads that transition be-
cause, if we don’t, somebody else will.
We want American companies to be
the world leaders in producing electric
buses, for example. We know that there
is an upfront cost. There is a long-term
savings, but an upfront cost that the
Federal Government can help with. It
will be good for our economy, in addi-
tion to being good for the environment.

Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today in support of my amendment
which would provide increased funding
to support the Department of Housing
and Urban Development’s Family Self-
Sufficiency Program.
Access to stable, safe, and affordable
housing is a fundamental human right.
In my district, the Massachusetts Sev-
enth, one of the most diverse and un-
equal districts in our Nation, we are
distinctly aware of the connection be-
tween housing and economic oppor-
tunity.
Affordable housing promotes healthy
living and provides low-income people
a chance at upward mobility. Without
it, families are destabilized, produc-
tivity suffers, and entire communities
crumble.
Recently, the Boston Housing Au-
thority partnered with Metro Housing
and Compass Working Capital, a non-
profit financial services organization
which provides financial coaching serv-
ices and support to Family Self-Suffi-
ciency Program participants in my dis-
trict.
The Family Self-Sufficiency Program
is a voluntary, 5-year program that
provides participants in the federally-
funded Housing Choice Voucher Pro-
gram the opportunity to save part of
their rent increase when they earn
more money at work. The program pro-
vides participating families with an
FSS savings account.
My amendment provides $5 million in
additional funding to the organizations
working with individuals and families
seeking to improve their financial
standing. This partnership, under the
auspices of the Family Self-Sufficiency
Program, has supported low-income
families to build assets, pay off debt,
and save for their retirement.
Participants have gone on to earn de-
grees, purchase their own homes, and
start small businesses.
This includes Julia, a woman who,
after years of working as a tailor and
taking on additional side work for
friends, learned about the FSS pro-
gram. Julia used Compass’ financial
coaching to launch JDLS Couture, a
tailoring and design business in Bos-
ton.
This includes Ernise, a resident of
Cambridge, who graduated from Com-
pass’ program last year. Ernise joined
the program while unemployed, saying
that before she joined she was ready to
give up. Ernise found full-time work,
paid off debt and increased her credit
score, and built enough savings to
begin the home purchasing process.

My amendment will support a pro-
gram rooted in financial empowerment
and independence, a proven program.
We must also work to enact policies
to guarantee housing for all and lever-
age the resources to make it a reality.
I encourage my colleagues to support
my amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.
PRICE).
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I thank my colleague for yield-
ing. I am happy to offer support for her
amendment.
Mr. Chair, the Family Self-Suffi-
ciency program helps low-income fami-
lies living in subsidized housing. It al-
lows them to enhance their job skills
and to increase earnings to improve
their economic security.
Currently, there are more than 75,000
families enrolled in FSS, which is just
a fraction of the number that should
be—the families living in assisted
housing, many, many more than that.
Mr. Chair, I am proud of the fact that
our base bill already increases this pro-
gram, providing $100 million for Fam-
ily Self-Sufficiency. That is a $20 mil-
lion increase from current funding.
This amendment would do even better,
would make FSS available to even
more families, so I applaud my col-
leagues for offering this.
I want to register some concern
about the offset in this and other
amendments in terms of the Office of
the Secretary and other departmental
staff. They do have to do their work,
and we have to consider the cumulative
effect of amendments, but we will do
that as the process moves along and we
go to conference.
Mr. Chair, the situation can be ad-
dressed. This is a useful and helpful
amendment, and I am happy to support
adoption.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.
PRESSLEY).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 289 OFFERED BY MS. PRESSLEY
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 289 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 449, line 19, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(reduced by $1,000,000)’’.
Page 449, line 19, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(increased by $1,000,000)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentlewoman
from Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY)
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Massachusetts.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Chair, I rise
today in support of my amendment,
which underscores the importance of
investing in safe, efficient, people-cen-
tered transportation systems for all
communities across the country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5068 June 24, 2019
I view every issue through a lens of
equity and health. Without access to
safe, reliable, and inclusive modes of
transportation, our collective well-
being suffers; our families suffer; our
communities suffer.
For far too long, our Federal trans-
portation funding and policies have
created a landscape which has exacer-
bated inequities and disparities, par-
ticularly for low-income communities,
people with disabilities, our youth and
seniors.
In my district, Black and Latino
commuters are more likely to experi-
ence longer travel times than their
White peers. These unequal burdens
make the promise of economic mobil-
ity further out of reach.
I recently rode the T back home with
an advocate named Dianna, who was
fighting for transit justice. We spent
over 2 hours making a journey of just a
little over 4 miles. Broken elevators
and outdated infrastructure meant
that the wheelchair Dianne uses to
navigate ran into constant access bar-
riers.
Just 2 weeks ago, the red line train
derailed twice in 1 week, causing mas-
sive gridlock across my district and
impacting the ability of riders to com-
mute to work, school, home, and every-
where in between.
Unfortunately, this isn’t new. MBTA
trains have derailed 43 times over the
last 5 years, the second highest total of
any metro transit system in our coun-
try. Many of these derailments place a
disproportionate burden on the shoul-
ders of low-wage hourly workers who
are rushing to their second- or third-
shift jobs, parents or caregivers who
are traveling with young children on
overcrowded and delayed trains, and
riders with disabilities who already ex-
perience the failures, daily, of a biased
and discriminatory system with ableist
privilege as a lens.
Our chronic underinvestment in mass
transit bus systems, bicycle-accessible
and pedestrian paths have caused in-
come inequality and opportunity gaps
in communities throughout the coun-
try.
According to the Leadership Con-
ference on Civil and Human Rights, in-
adequate access to affordable, reliable
transportation has exacerbated health
disparities, forcing many low-income
patients to miss appointments, often-
times worsening medical problems.
Mr. Chair, people do not live in silos.
They live in intersectionality, and our
policies at the Federal, State, and local
levels should reflect this reality.
We cannot spur economic develop-
ment and tackle economic inequities in
urban, suburban, and rural commu-
nities without modernized roads,
bridges, and mass transit, which con-
nects communities to jobs and higher
education.
We cannot tackle health disparities
without reliable and affordable mass
transit systems which enable low-in-
come families, seniors, and people with
disabilities to access care.
We cannot tackle the existential
threat of climate change without in-
tentionally investing in mass transit
systems that protect frontline commu-
nities and alleviate the environmental
health hazards caused by traffic con-
gestion.
Transit equity is a civil rights issue
and an economic justice issue. We must
continue to invest in transit infra-
structure, multimodal improvements
that promote inclusivity and depend-
ability.
My amendment emphasizes the im-
portant role that Federal policy and in-
vestments make in equalizing access to
reliable commuter rail and other mass
transit options for all. The BUILD
grant program helps to support these
types of State and locally driven tran-
sit projects.
From investing in bus or commuter
rail systems or cycling and pedestrian
path projects, the BUILD program
helps to drive innovative projects, and
it seeks to expand the system, and is
people-centered.
Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman PRICE
for his efforts to ensure robust funding
for this program, which I do believe
gets us one step closer to addressing
these inequities across the system, re-
pairing our crumbling infrastructure,
as well as expanding our investment in
multimodal transit.
Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.
PRICE), the chairman.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, may I inquire as to how much
time is remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Massachusetts has 1 minute re-
maining.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I thank my colleague for yield-
ing. I am happy to offer support for her
amendment and to take advantage of
the opportunity this offers to say
something about the BUILD program.
Mr. Chair, it is unique, as our col-
league has stressed. It provides the
kind of flexible funding to States and
localities that can address complex
multimodal projects.
My district has benefited greatly
from this. The city of Raleigh has suc-
cessfully built Union Station, a state-
of-the-art rail and public transit facil-
ity that is already transforming that
area of downtown.
Unfortunately, despite the diverse
set of eligible projects, the current ad-
ministration has heavily favored road
projects only when awarding BUILD
grants. This has most significantly af-
fected transit. On average, it received
about 32 percent of the awards during
the previous administration.
Under the Trump administration,
this has plummeted to less than 10 per-
cent, and at the same time, the Depart-
ment has completely abandoned bicy-
cle and pedestrian improvement
projects and actually eliminated this
as an option for primary project type
for years 2017 and 2018.
So, the underlying bill provides $1
billion for BUILD—that is a $100 mil-
lion increase—but it places greater em-
phasis on investments in transit, pas-
senger rail, pedestrian improvements,
and multimodal projects. It also main-
tains a 50-50 parity between urban and
rural awards, while directing the De-
partment to consider the full range of
benefits from a project, regardless of
location in an urban or rural area.
Mr. Chair, I commend my colleague
for offering this amendment. I am
happy to support it and look forward to
continuing to work with her on this
issue.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.
PRESSLEY).

So the amendment was rejected.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I move that the Committee do

The motion was agreed to.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.
TITUS) having assumed the chair, Mr.
PETERS, Acting Chair of the Committee
of the Whole House on the state of the
Union, reported that that Committee,
having had under consideration the bill
(H.R. 3055) making appropriations for
the Departments of Commerce and Jus-
tice, Science, and Related Agencies for
the fiscal year ending September 30,
2020, and for other purposes, had come
to no resolution thereon.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5072 June 24, 2019
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 962,
BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SUR-
VIVORS PROTECTION ACT
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged
from further consideration of H.R. 962,
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act, and ask for its immediate
consideration in the House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
PETERS). Under guidelines consistently
issued by successive Speakers, as re-
corded in section 956 of the House
Rules and Manual, the Chair is con-
strained not to entertain the request
unless it has been cleared by the bipar-
tisan floor and committee leaderships.
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, if this
unanimous consent request cannot be
entertained, I urge the Speaker and the
majority leader to immediately sched-
ule the Born-Alive bill so we can stand
up and protect the sanctity of human
life, and I ask for all others to join in
that request.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is not recognized.
f
ENSURING AMERICANS GET A
FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, under Presi-
dent Obama, the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau was created and
tasked with implementing critical pro-
tections for the American people. That
work continues to be important today,
and I urge the CFPB to maintain the
safeguards that were put in place to en-
sure that Americans get a fair oppor-
tunity to succeed.
Protecting military families and oth-
ers from predatory lending is not a par-
tisan issue. Making sure that banks are
not targeting students from working
and middle-class backgrounds with ex-
cessive fees is not a partisan issue.
Looking out for senior citizens, who
are disproportionately vulnerable to
scams is not a partisan issue.
Countering fraud and abuse isn’t just
morally right, it is also an economic
imperative. We cannot forget the les-
sons of the Great Recession about what
happens when we let fraudulent and
predatory practices run rampant across
our economy. We all lose.
The House recently passed H.R. 1500,
which would reverse recent changes
that have weakened the agency’s abil-
ity to carry out its work. Now the Sen-
ate needs to hold its vote on this bill.
f
HONORING DAVID BELLAVIA
(Mr. COLLINS of New York asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute.)
Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to honor Iraq war
veteran David Bellavia, who is, tomor-
row, receiving the Medal of Honor from
President Trump.
On November 10, 2004, while clearing
a block of houses in Fallujah, Iraq,
then-Staff Sergeant David Bellavia’s
platoon came under attack. David
quickly rose to action and charged into
a house where his men were trapped.
He provided cover fire, which allowed
his men to safely exit the building.
David then reentered that house,
going floor to floor and neutralizing
the threat by individually killing four
insurgents and wounding a fifth in
what can only be called an epic battle.
That day, David Bellavia rescued an
entire squad and cleared an insurgent
stronghold, protecting his platoon from
further threat.
Tomorrow, President Trump will
award David the Medal of Honor for his
heroic actions, becoming the first liv-
ing Iraq war veteran to be so honored.
Congratulations to my constituent
and my friend. Most importantly, we
thank David for his heroic actions and
his service to our country.
f
CELEBRATING THE UNITED
STATES COAST GUARD AUXILIARY
(Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute
and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of
New York. Mr. Speaker, I have the
honor of serving as the chairman of the
Coast Guard and Maritime Transpor-
tation Subcommittee, and yesterday,
the United States Coast Guard Auxil-
iary celebrated 80 years of service to
the United States.
Since June 23, 1939, the United States
Coast Guard Auxiliary has contributed
to the safety and security of our citi-
zens, ports, waterways, and coastal re-
gions by providing crucial support to
our hardworking Active-Duty Coast
Guard workforce.
As the uniformed auxiliary service of
the Coast Guard, these women and men
provide Public Safety Boating Edu-
cation training, conduct safety patrols,
and provide important mission support
functions that are essential to the con-
tinued success of Coast Guard oper-
ations.
Each year, Coast Guard Auxiliary
provides nearly 4 million hours oper-
ating 1,800 vessels, 160 aircraft, and
1,400 radio facilities helping to main-
tain a keen awareness of our expansive
maritime domain.
In 2018 alone, the Coast Guard Auxil-
iary conducted 542,000 vessel safety
checks and marine dealer visits, deliv-
ered over 120,000 hours of boating safe-
ty instruction, logged nearly 15 million
hours of support, saved over 600 lives,
assisted over 17,000 boaters in distress,
and prevented the loss of more than $94
million in property.
So today I ask my colleagues to rec-
ognize the great Americans who have
served and those who continue to serve
the United States Coast Guard Auxil-
iary for their selfless service to our
great Nation.

HONORING FRISCO POLICE CHIEF
JOHN BRUCE
(Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, today, I
rise to recognize the service of Frisco
Police Chief John Bruce, who com-
pleted his last days as acting chief in
May.
Chief Bruce has been with the Frisco
Police Department for more than 23
years. After accepting the position as
police chief in 2013, he has been respon-
sible for ensuring the safety of more
than 185,000 residents.
The Frisco community appreciates
Chief Bruce’s willingness to serve those
around him. His dedication to pro-
tecting his community has not gone
unnoticed.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to
join me today in thanking Chief Bruce
for his service and wishing him the
best of luck in his journey ahead.

RECOGNIZING CONGRESSIONAL
AWARD WINNERS
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, let me
tell you about 17 remarkable people:
Zachary Asselta, Robert Cuff, Alex-
andra Kukal, Ozlem Akilli, Justin
Billman, Ashley Burkey, Kevin
Sheppard, Lindsey Wettstein, Gabrielle
Akiatan, Karen Chainey, Andrew
Crain, San’aa Doss, Anthony Kukal,
Megan Majewski, Genevieve Morgan,
Jayme Sooy, and Joshua Whitaker.
Who are they? A group of impressive
young students from Millville, New
Jersey, who have been recognized as
Congressional Award winners. These
young people worked hard to complete
countless hours of volunteer work, as
well as personal and physical activity
and multiple day expeditions and ex-
plorations.
Together, believe it or not, these 17
students have accomplished over 3,500
hours of volunteer work.
I am so proud of the hard work and
service these students have brought to
south Jersey. They deserve to be Con-
gressional Award winners.

REMEMBERING NANCY NELSON
LEWIS
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember the life of
Mrs. Nancy Nelson Lewis, who passed
away on June 7 at the age of 91.

courses both in New York and at the
Savannah College of Art and Design,
she painted countless portraits of
Savannahians around town, free of
charge. In lieu of payment, she asked
for donations to local charities.
Working hard to grow the art com-
munity and develop young artists, she
established a fine arts hall at Savan-
nah Christian Preparatory School.
In 2016, the Savannah College of Art
and Design’s president inducted Mrs.
Lewis as a Savannah Woman of Vision
to celebrate her talents that helped to
shape our Savannah community.
Mr. Speaker, our city truly would
not be the same without the life of
Mrs. Lewis. Her family will be in my
thoughts and prayers during this most
difficult time.
f
INCREASE FUNDING FOR
COMMERCIAL SPACE ACTIVITIES
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to thank Ranking Member DIAZ-
BALART and Chairman PRICE for work-
ing together on the bipartisan en bloc
package that passed the House this
afternoon. That package included my
amendment to increase funding for
commercial space activities at the
FAA by $8 million.
In Florida, and all over the country,
we are seeing the commercial space in-
dustry continue to grow rapidly, and
the launch frequency is only expected
to increase.

which received strong, bipartisan sup-
port and was signed into law at the end
of the 115th Congress, recognized the
need to begin increasing funding for
the Office of Commercial Space Trans-
portation. My amendment increased
funding to $33 million, the fiscal year
2019 authorized level. This will ensure
the Office of Commercial Space Trans-
portation has the resources necessary
to facilitate increased commercial
space launches and reentries.

Lord, give them the grace and mercy
that will inspire them to live for Your

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-

2020—MOTION TO PROCEED—Re-
sumed
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the
Senate will resume consideration of
the motion to proceed to S. 1790, which
the clerk will report.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read as follows:
Motion to proceed to the consideration of
S. 1790, a bill to authorize appropriations for
fiscal year 2020 for military activities of the
Department of Defense, for military con-
struction, and for defense activities of the
Department of Energy, to prescribe military
personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and
for other purposes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in vir-
tually every aspect of our lives, tech-
nology and innovation have made jobs
simpler and made us much more effi-
cient. You can easily track your ap-
pointments, hail a ride, or even change
the temperature of your house from
your smartphone. You can broaden the
reach of your small business, use fund-
raising platforms to raise money for a
cause you care about, and easily stay
connected with friends and family
around the globe. But for all the ways
these innovations have made our daily
life easier, they have also created an
array of security challenges.
We are all familiar with the high-pro-
file hacking targeting customer finan-
cial data and personal information. To
be sure, it is scary, but nowhere is the
threat of this hyperinnovation more
terrifying than on the national secu-
rity front.
The challenges we confront today
look different from those 100, 50, or
even 5 years ago. We are seeing new
technologies used in the battlefield,
like drones, and the race to develop
next-generation hypersonic missiles.
Top military officials, including ADM
Gary Roughead, cochair of the Com-
mission on National Defense Strategy,
have voiced their concerns about our
ability as a nation to confront these
rapidly evolving threats. Admiral
Roughead told Congress: ‘‘We are oper-
ating a force today that was last mod-
ernized in the 1980s.’’
That is unacceptable. We cannot send
our men and women in uniform into
battle to defend our freedom at a dis-
advantage or allow these rapidly
changing threats to outpace our ability
to respond. Our military should never
be fighting next-generation wars with
last-generation weapons and equip-
ment.
Of course, the goal is not to have to
fight any wars but to maintain the
peace through a superior military over
any of our potential adversaries. We
must continue to invest in military
modernization, which is why we need
to pass the National Defense Author-
ization Act, the bill that is presently
before the Senate.
This bill invests in cutting-edge tech-
nology to protect our military’s com-
bat advantage, including to promote 5G
networks, the hypersonic weapons that
we need to develop to maintain par-
ity—at least, with our adversaries—and
artificial intelligence.

It also invests in nuclear weapons
modernization, something I spoke
about on the floor just this last week.
As our adversaries continue to develop
the use of their nuclear arsenal, main-
taining a safe and strong nuclear deter-
rent is the key to preventing nuclear
war and keeping our adversaries in
check.
This year’s Defense authorization bill
also takes major steps to improve the
quality of life for our troops and their
families. America’s 2.1 million service-
members have made a commitment
that few are willing to make and have
joined the ranks of America’s heroes
who have defended our great country
throughout our history.
This bill will provide a modest 3.1
percent pay raise for our troops—the
largest increase in a decade. I hope it
will also include a provision that I
have introduced to support our service-
members during life after the military.
Occasionally, when veterans fall on
hard times, their disability benefits
can be counted as income in bank-
ruptcy court. That is not the case for
their civilian counterparts with their
Social Security disability, and it is un-
acceptable to me that a civilian with
disability benefits would get better
treatment in bankruptcy court than a
veteran. To fix this issue, I have intro-
duced a bill with Senator BALDWIN
from Wisconsin, called the Honoring
American Veterans in Extreme Need
Act, or the HAVEN Act. This bill would
shield VA and Department of Defense
disability benefits in the same way
that Social Security disability is cur-
rently exempted.
Veterans should not be penalized for
receiving the disability compensation
they have earned, and I hope this pro-
vision will be included in the Defense
authorization bill, which we should
soon be able to vote on.
Passing this bill is not only impor-
tant to the safety of our Nation, but it
is important for global security as
well. It supports programs and policies
that will strengthen existing alliances
and promote new ones.
I am hopeful that the final version of
this bill will include a provision I have
introduced to enhance our relationship
with India. In 2016 the United States
designated India as a major defense
partner, which seeks to elevate our de-
fense partnership with India to the
same level as that of our closest allies.
Since then, we have taken a number
of steps to strengthen our defense rela-
tionship, such as establishing ministe-
rial dialogue, increasing arms sales to
India, and the first U.S.-India tri-serv-
ice exercise later this year.
As cochair of the Senate India Cau-
cus, I continue to advocate for policies
that strengthen our ties with India,
both militarily and otherwise. I intro-
duced legislation that requires the Sec-
retary of Defense to submit a report to
Congress on U.S.-India defense coopera-
tion in the Western Indian Ocean with-
in 180 days of enactment. This will
allow us to get a clearer picture of cur-
rent military activities and will enable
the Secretary to enter into military
cooperation agreements and conduct
regular joint military training and op-
erations with India in the Western In-
dian Ocean.
Including this provision in the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act
would be a major step to bolster U.S.-
India ties and strengthen our alliance.
It is only fitting for the world’s oldest
democracy and the world’s largest de-
mocracy to continue to work more and
more closely together.
As we work to counter increasingly
sophisticated adversaries around the
world, passing the Defense authoriza-
tion bill this week could not be more
important. This legislation is integral
to ensuring that our military is
resourced and trained and ready for ac-
tion when called upon.
That is why for more than 50 years,
Congress has made passing the Defense
authorization bill an annual priority.
Funding our men and women in uni-
form who are fighting and facing un-
precedented threats around the world
on our behalf is a no-brainer. I look
forward to voting to support the NDAA
later this week, and I want to thank
Chairman INHOFE and the ranking
member, Senator REED, for working to
get this bill passed with broad bipar-
tisan support, as well as thank the
Senate Armed Services Committee for
working to get this bill to this point
and bringing it to the floor in a broad,
bipartisan way.
This bill provides our military men
and women the resources and equip-
ment they need to defend our country
and later transition back into civilian
life. It restores our combat advantage
by promoting military modernization.
It strengthens and builds alliances
around the globe. Above all, it sends a
message to the entire world that our
country is and will remain the global
military leader.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The Democratic leader is recognized.
VICTIM COMPENSATION FUND
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, to-
morrow my friend John Feal and fellow
survivors who were first responders on
September 11 will visit with Leader
MCCONNELL to press for the passage of
legislation to fix the shortfall of the
Victim Compensation Fund. This is the
fund that awards compensation to the
families of 9/11 first responders who
died from 9/11-related illnesses, often
cancers and fatal respiratory illnesses.
It makes me sick to my stomach that
every time we have this debate, these
suffering first responders, many in
wheelchairs, are forced to travel to
Washington to shame politicians into
supporting their healthcare.
I am sick of all of these delays; I am
tired of temporary reauthorizations;
and I have had enough of watching our
first responders endure the indignity of
waiting for a last-minute, must-pass
bill to hide their issue in so Members
will not vote against it. It shouldn’t be
this way, and it shouldn’t be this hard
to pass aid for our 9/11 responders and
everyone who worked on the pile in the
weeks and months thereafter.
Who has been standing in the way?
At the top of the list, unfortunately, is
my colleague the Republican leader.
Leader MCCONNELL has to do the right
thing here. He is meeting with these
brave responders, and that is a good
thing, but it is not enough. At the end
of the meeting, he should promise
them, and promise all of us, that he
will put the Victim Compensation
Fund fix on the floor as soon as it
passes the House as a stand-alone bill—
no more delays for these brave people,
no more people like Ray Fifer, my dear
friend who passed away, having to
come to Washington five or six times
begging and pleading, not for himself—
he knew the cancer was fatal for him—
but for his colleagues and allies. Let’s
do the right thing here.
Let’s do the right thing, Leader
MCCONNELL.
IRAN
Mr. President, on another matter,
amid escalating tensions with Iran, the
President today announced a new
round of sanctions. It remains unclear
what, if any, strategy this latest round
of sanctions fits into and whether this
latest round of sanctions will compel
Iran’s leaders to alter their current
course. I worry that the President con-
tinues down a path of escalation.
Besides a small group of hawkish ad-
visers and Republican cheerleaders in
Congress, nobody wants a war with
Iran. The American people are weary of
endless wars in the Middle East, the
trillions of dollars wasted, the thou-
sands of American lives lost. Ameri-
cans want the money spent here at
home on things like our crumbling in-
frastructure. Americans don’t want to
see their sons and daughters dying in a
war that seems to go on forever with-
out a conclusion.
While I am not convinced the Presi-
dent is eager to go to war, I am very
concerned that he could bumble us into
war. His strategy seems erratic, chang-
ing from day to day and week to week.
It seems opaque. There is no real dis-
cussion outside of his own little clique
of advisers, and it seems to sometimes
contradict itself.
Exchanges of aggression can escalate
and cascade quickly in the Middle
East; provocations can spin out of con-
trol. The President’s lack of a steady
hand, lack of transparency, and, above
all, his lack of strategy make the dan-
ger of escalation even more distinct
and worrisome.

June 24, 2019
It is also worrisome that John Bolton
and Secretary Pompeo, the advocates
for the conflict, appear to be leading
the charge while there is no confirmed
Secretary of Defense to pull back the
reins, and it is interesting that it
seems to be the Department of Defense
that are the reins on the President.
They know the limits of what we can
do without escalation and the kind of
endless war that our soldiers and our
military leaders have always fought for
this country, no matter what the con-
sequences.
So let me be clear: If the President is
going to engage the United States in
another war in the Middle East, he is
going to have to convince the Amer-
ican people, and he is going to have to
come to Congress for authorization.
One of the best ways to avoid bumbling
into a war is to have a robust, open de-
bate and for Congress to have some
say. We have learned that lesson in the
run up to Iraq.
Democrats have an amendment to
the NDAA led by Senators Udall,
Merkley, Murphy, and Kaine that
would prohibit any funds authorized by
the NDAA to be used to conduct hos-
tilities against the Government of
Iran. It makes imminent sense to con-
sider this amendment on our annual
defense bill. It is germane; it is timely.
Considering the gravity of the situa-
tion with Iran, Democrats believe the
full Senate should be present to vote
on the Udall amendment. Leader
MCCONNELL is no doubt aware that sev-
eral Members of this body will be ab-
sent this week for the Democratic
Presidential debates. We should wait to
have the vote until the full body is
present. There is no rush to complete
the NDAA. We have passed it very fre-
quently later in the year with no harm-
ful consequences to our military.
We should have the vote on the Udall
amendment, which is an urgency, be-
fore we bumble into war, and it should
occur when every Senator is able to
cast their vote. Last week, the Repub-
lican leader promised the Senate would
hold an open amendment process on
the NDAA. We have critical national
security issues to debate, including
Iran, including election security.
Will the Republican leader keep his
word and allow this debate to go for-
ward? For much of this year, Leader
MCCONNELL, unfortunately, and now
becoming known from one end of
America to the another, has turned the
Senate into a legislative graveyard,
where we hardly ever vote on the pre-
vailing issue of the day.
Will the majority leader let the Sen-
ate have this important vote? Or is this
another issue, another debate, the abil-
ity to fund a war that will be buried in
his legislative graveyard?
I hope he will not continue his
shameful record of ducking the issues
of the day when it comes to something
as important as Congress’s role in the
matter of war and peace.
BORDER SECURITY
Finally, Mr. President, on the border,
after a week of making the chilling,
nasty, obnoxious threats about mass
arrests and deportation of millions of
immigrants, President Trump backed
off on Sunday and demanded conces-
sions from Democrats in exchange.
In doing so, the President reminded
the American people that he might be
incapable of having a rational discus-
sion about challenges at the border.
Look at the things he has gone
through—tariffs, closed the border—
issue after issue, he makes threats,
then backs off because none of them
make any sense, none of them have
been thought through.
The President seems far more com-
fortable terrorizing immigrant families
than actually coming up with real so-
lutions. I mean, my God, to threaten
separating children from their parents
as a bargaining chip is the very defini-
tion of callousness. That is something
that the vast majority of Americans
would abhor, and he goes right ahead
and does it.
Unfortunately, however, this is typ-
ical of the President’s approach to the
border. For 2 years, the President has
said he wants to fix the problems at
the border, but just about every action
he has taken has made things worse.
He shut down the government in a
failed attempt to fund an ineffective
wall. He threatened to close the border
entirely until the business community
rebelled and said it would really hurt
our economy and our workers. He
threatened destructive tariffs with
Mexico, and he has cut off security as-
sistance to Central American countries
that help curb the violence and law-
lessness that contributes to the flow of
migrants in the first place.
His administration has separated
children from their parents, kept them
in cages, let them suffer in horrible
conditions in for-profit detention cen-
ters that are little better than modern
internment camps.
These are not the actions of an ad-
ministration that is trying to solve a
problem. It seems the President is in-
capable of saying it is a real problem—
he thinks it is—and people agree that
we have to do something at the border.
We all do.
But instead of actually getting ex-
perts in and solving the problem, he is
emotional, appeals to the dark side of
human nature, and then is totally in-
consistent and is on to doing the next
thing. Any objective observer would
say the President doesn’t want to solve
this problem.
He is, rather, trying to exploit it for
what he thinks will be his political
benefit, although it sure didn’t work in
the month before the 2018 election. To
exploit an issue like this because he
thinks it will benefit him politically,
even if it means mistreating children
and striking fear into the hearts of
millions of people living in the U.S.,
that is disgraceful.
The thing is we can have a rational
conversation about this. This week, the
Senate will consider a bipartisan
agreement on supplemental appropria-
tions for the border. That is a good
thing. I salute Senator SHELBY, a Re-
publican, and Senator LEAHY, a Demo-
crat, who are coming together on a
proposal that got 30 of the 31 votes on
the Appropriations Committee. It
shows that we can be rational and com-
promise and get something done on the
border, even if it does not meet
everybody’s needs 100 percent of the
way.
Beyond that, we Democrats continue
to propose commonsense changes that
would address what is happening at the
border to deal with the root causes of
migration. Doesn’t it make sense to
tell these people from Nicaragua and El
Salvador they can claim asylum in
their home countries and not go
through the 1,000-mile trek—often ex-
pensive because they have to pay
coyotes to cross the north border of
Mexico and with the United States. Of
course, it does.
Doesn’t it make sense to have more
immigration judges to reduce the back-
log in cases? And doesn’t it make sense
to provide security assistance and help
to those three Central American coun-
tries to combat the scourge of drug
cartels, violent gangs, and lawlessness
that has pushed migrants to go north
because they don’t want their child
murdered and raped?
Both parties can support these poli-
cies. President Trump can support
these policies, but so far, the President
has shown a shameful lack of willing-
ness to engage with the real problems
at the border, preferring demagoguery
and fear-mongering to progress.

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

AMERICAN MINERS ACT
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I
rise today to call for immediate action
on the American Miners Act. We have
an obligation to the coal miners across
America who served our Nation by pro-
viding us with energy through our
greatest advancements. They deserve
to know that the pensions they right-
fully worked for will be funded fully.
They deserve to have acceptable
healthcare, which was guaranteed to
them, and they paid for it.
As the Senate fails to act, we con-
tinue to put our retired miners’
healthcare and pension benefits in
jeopardy yet again. I have been work-
ing with everyone from every angle in
order to prevent our miners from los-
ing their healthcare and retirement
benefits, but, once again, they are fac-
ing a deadline that puts their whole
livelihood at risk.
This has been a long fight, and it is
far from over. Everyone—and I mean

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4200 June 24, 2019
everyone—who has joined me in this
journey understands that they are
fighting for the working people, and
that is what we were sent here to do.
These retired miners are walking the
halls and fighting for what is rightfully
theirs. I am doing this for them. I
promised them that this body will not
abandon them. I refuse to let them
down.
The 1974 pension plan will be insol-
vent by 2022 if we do not act now. Min-
ers who receive their healthcare
through companies that went bankrupt
in 2018 are at risk of losing their cov-
erage in the coming months if we fail
to act soon. Unlike many other public-
private pension plans, the 1974 pension
plan was well managed and 94 percent
funded prior to the crash of 2008. How-
ever, the 2008 crash hit at a time when
the plan had its highest payment obli-
gations to the retirees. If the plan be-
comes insolvent, these beneficiaries
will face benefit cuts and the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation will as-
sume billions of dollars in liabilities.
To address these issues, the Amer-
ican Miners Act would shore up the
1974 pension plan, which is headed for
insolvency due to coal company bank-
ruptcies and the 2008 financial crisis. It
would ensure that the miners who are
at risk due to the 2018 coal company
bankruptcies will not lose their
healthcare. It would extend the Black
Lung Disability Trust Fund tax at $1.10
per ton of underground-mined coal and
55 cents per ton of surface-mined coal
for 10 years.
West Virginia has more retired min-
ers than any other State. More than
27,000 retirees live in West Virginia
alone. Most of those who are receiving
these pensions are widows. The pen-
sions for these widows—basically, it is
a family affair when someone in the
family mines—on average is less than
$600 per month—less than $600. They
have worked for it. Their husbands
worked for it. They have been counting
on it. Basically, it is a lifeline for
them. Because of the bankruptcies that
have allowed companies to walk away
from the legacy costs and leave them
with nothing after they negotiated to
not take home the pay to take care of
this themselves, they are left in a very
vulnerable position, which we should
never have let happen.
I have a letter from a retired coal
miner to read to you today. I think it
puts everything in perspective. This is
Delbert from West Virginia, who was a
miner for 35 years. He said:
To the members of the Senate and House:
Months ago, I walked the corridors of Wash-
ington, D.C., asking many members of Con-
gress for help. I spoke with Mitch McConnell
and bled my heart out to him, how this was
not only the right thing to do but it was also
a matter of life and death to many thousands
of coal miners.
If this letter is read on the Senate and
House floors, I plead with each and every one
of you to search your hearts and souls today.
Close your eyes and imagine giving your
youth and your entire working life to the
coal industry, and the only promise you were
given was a small retirement check and med-
ical insurance. I know a favorable ruling for
these miners will cost the taxpayers nothing.
It will not lead to an increase in the deficit.
I realize all we are asking for is the interest
earned off the unused reclamation fund.
Most coal companies are even on board with
this.
These miners have black lung. Many have
to use oxygen 24 hours a day. Many have to
use wheelchairs, walkers, and canes. Their
bodies are broken. Please don’t break their
hearts, spirits, and souls also. Please save
their lives and pass this bill today.
He is a proud veteran of the Vietnam
War, a proud coal miner, and a proud
American. Please don’t say no to these
deserving miners and spouses.
Let me give to you in a nutshell what
they are asking for. In 1946, when
Harry Truman was President, the
Krug-Lewis Agreement was signed.
That was John L. Lewis. The miners
had to work for our industry and our
economy to keep moving forward.
Until that time they had no pension
and no retirement. From that day for-
ward it was promised to every miner
that for every ton of coal that would be
mined, there would be a certain set-
aside on the price of coal that would go
into their pension and retirement be-
cause it was an important industry and
important commodity for the economy
of our great country.
After World War II, when the econ-
omy fell, miners were on strike, and
they couldn’t take care of themselves.
This is how we got this bill, a guar-
antee from the Federal Government
that they would be taken care of. It
was not that the Federal taxpayer and
government were going to pay for it. It
was basically funded through the prod-
uct they were mining and the products
being sold, which gave them the re-
sources to take care of their retire-
ment and pensions.
Somebody got this money when there
was a bankruptcy, and it wasn’t the
people who worked for it. The bank-
ruptcy laws in this country are so
messed up that they don’t give money
to the human beings—they don’t give
it to the workers who basically worked
for this and didn’t take money home to
their families because it was based in
their retirement and pension plan, and
then, all of a sudden, it is gone. All of
the financial institutions line up first.
It is not the working person at the
front of the line. They are in the back
of the line getting nothing. That is
what we are trying to change here.
We are trying to make sure that the
people who have given everything they
have for this great country—they are
patriotic, they fought in the war, and
they mined the coal that basically
built America. Now we are about ready
to let it go down.
We had this bill fixed 3 years ago. I
talked with Majority Leader MCCON-
NELL about both the pension and the
healthcare, but they separated it. We
got the healthcare benefits for a cer-
tain portion of those people but not the
pension plan. If there is one bank-
ruptcy between now and 2022, this
whole thing collapses immediately.
On the other hand, the guaranteed
funding that the Federal Government
does pay for will be hit hard, and it
could break down. So we have a crisis
looming. We can avoid it or we can
allow this to happen, as we do so many
things around here.
Why has this become a political
fight? It shouldn’t be. We have bipar-
tisan support. We had almost every
member on the Finance Committee
from both parties—Democrats and Re-
publicans—support it, but it never
made it past the person who is respon-
sible for putting it on the floor.
I hope that all my colleagues will
consider the widows and their $600 pen-
sions, which means the difference be-
tween having a life and basically wor-
rying from day to day whether they are
going to have food or medical care for
whatever they need. These pensions are
not extravagant. These pensions are a
necessity and something that is need-
ed. So I implore all of my colleagues to
look at this very hard and try to get
this on the NDAA. This is something
we all should be fighting for and help-
ing the people who fought for us, who
gave us the quality of life we have and
the great country we have.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise
today with my colleague from Ala-
bama, Senator JONES, to urge our col-
leagues’ support for our amendment to
the National Defense Authorization
Act. It would repeal the Survivor Ben-
efit Plan and dependency indemnity
compensation offset, more commonly
known as the military widow’s tax.
This unfair offset is currently pre-
venting as many as 65,000 surviving
military spouses—more than 260 of
them in the State of Maine—from re-
ceiving the full benefits they deserve.
The Defense Department’s Survivor
Benefit Plan, or SBP, is primarily an
insurance benefit that military fami-
lies purchase in their retirement. It
provides cash benefits to a surviving
spouse or other eligible recipients
when a retiree passes away. On the
other hand, the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs dependency and indem-
nity compensation, known as DIC, is a
monthly, tax-free payment to survivors
and dependents of servicemembers who
pass away from service-related condi-
tions.
For example, if a military retiree
pays premiums into the SBP insurance
program, then his or her spouse ought
to be able to receive those benefits
when the retiree passes away. What we
find instead, however, is that surviving

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4201
June 24, 2019
spouses receiving these insurance pay-
ments have a dollar-for-dollar offset
for the separate payments they are re-
ceiving from the VA. In some cases,
this leads to the total elimination of
the Survivor Benefit Plan benefit. In
other cases, the offset greatly reduces
the benefit. In either case, it is out-
and-out unfair and harms the survivors
of our servicemembers and military re-
tirees. The average offset amounts to
about $925 per month, which is often a
significant amount of money that a
widow or a widower needs to help sup-
port their families or themselves in the
absence of their spouses.
Military commanders often say that
you recruit the soldier but you retain
the family. We have an obligation to
make sure we are taking care of our
military families who sacrifice so
much for our country.
Our amendment has the support of
numerous military and veterans advo-
cacy groups, including the Gold Star
Wives of America, the Military Officers
Association of America, the National
Military Family Association, the Trag-
edy Assistance Program for Survivors,
and the VFW, among others.
More than 75 Senators—three-quar-
ters of the Members of this Chamber—
and 340 Members of the House of Rep-
resentatives support the effort Senator
JONES and I have led by cosponsoring
our stand-alone bill. In fact, this legis-
lation has been adopted by the Senate
in the past numerous times, always by
an overwhelming margin or by a voice
vote, only to be later stripped out in
the conference process.
This problem goes back decades, but
this year we can finally solve it once
and for all. It is time for us to do our
duty not only to support the brave men
and women who serve in our military
but also to support their families. I en-
courage each of our colleagues to join
in this bipartisan effort and support
the repeal of the military widow’s tax
as part of the NDAA.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama.
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, I want to
echo what my colleague and friend, the
Senator from Maine, has said about the
elimination of the widow’s tax and rise
today to urge this body to bring the
Military Widow’s Tax Elimination Act
of 2019 to the Senate floor for a vote
this week as an amendment to the
NDAA.
I introduced this bipartisan legisla-
tion with my friend and colleague Sen-
ator COLLINS this year. It has been in-
troduced numerous times. Legislation
that is designed to right a terrible
wrong has been introduced numerous
times over the last 18 years but with-
out success.
Today, we are at an alltime high for
cosponsorship. Seventy-five Members
of this body, Republicans and Demo-
crats, support this legislation and have
signed on as cosponsors. The only other
major bill with support in this Con-
gress like that was the one we recently
passed by unanimous consent to crack
down on robocalls, which I know is
something we can all agree needed to
be done, and just like that, this legisla-
tion is needed as well.
As Senator COLLINS talked about, the
military widow’s tax bill has earned
overwhelming support on both sides of
the aisle and from groups like TAPS,
the Tragedy Assistance Program for
Survivors, the Military Officers Asso-
ciation of America, and the VFW. Sup-
port out there is overwhelming because
it is simply the right thing to do.
The law currently prohibits military
widows from receiving their full sur-
vivor benefits from both the VA and
the additional Department of Defense
Survivor Benefit Plan that they paid
into voluntarily. These Gold Star fami-
lies—as many as, I think, 65,000 across
the country and as many as 2,000 in my
home State of Alabama—are being
ripped off. It is just that plain and sim-
ple.
To add insult to injury, they are
being ripped off by the very U.S. Gov-
ernment that their loved ones swore to
protect. That is absolutely shameful,
that we would treat our military fami-
lies in such a way. We obviously—obvi-
ously—can never repay these families
for their loss and the sacrifices they
have made, but it is our duty, I sub-
mit—our duty—to try to do all we can.
And we can dang sure stop the govern-
ment from robbing them of the benefits
they have paid for and earned.
At the end of the day, this is a cost
of war. It is a cost of freedom, more im-
portantly. It is a cost of freedom. So
for folks to say that this fix is too ex-
pensive or that there is not an obvious
pay-for in our budgets that we have
today, I would remind my colleagues
that this bill has made it into the
NDAA several times before, and we
have waived—this body has waived the
pay-go rules for it several times in the
past because Members of this body
have recognized that there are more
important issues at play here. Many of
my colleagues have supported this bill
without a pay-for in the past.
This week, we will be considering the
NDAA, and I am very grateful to Sen-
ator INHOFE, the chairman of the
Armed Services Committee, who is re-
sponsible for shepherding this defense
authorization on the floor this week.
The committee, of which I am a
member, has done just incredible bipar-
tisan work to get the NDAA to the
floor this week.
Senator INHOFE is a cosponsor of this
bill. In 2008, when the bill came to the
floor of the Senate as an NDAA amend-
ment earlier, also without a pay-for, he
noted that an effort to eliminate the
widow’s tax had been in the works for
8 years at that point, since 2000. He
urged his colleagues to right this
wrong. He spoke on the floor, stating:
It is time we give back these benefits to
those families of those who have served
bravely in defense of our Nation. I think it is
an insult to their honor and their memory to
do anything else.
I couldn’t agree more, and I hope
that our colleagues today will, too, and
will continue their support for our vet-
erans and widows and will work with
our leaders to ensure that this amend-
ment gets a vote during the NDAA de-
liberations.
This is our chance to right this
wrong once and for all. This is not a
partisan issue. It is an issue of common
ground and, significantly, of common
purpose. That is precisely why 75 Mem-
bers of this body have signed on as co-
sponsors, to say that it is their funda-
mental belief that we should honor our
promise to the families of the best and
bravest among us who have given their
lives in service to our Nation.
I thank my Republican colleague,
Senator COLLINS of Maine, for her lead-
ership on this important issue and for
being a great partner in the fight to fi-
nally get this legislation passed once
and for all. Like she did a few moments
ago, I urge all the rest of my colleagues
in this body to call for this amendment
to be brought to the floor for a vote
this week as an amendment to the
NDAA. Let our votes speak louder than
our words. Let’s finally right this
wrong.
I yield the floor.

SEC. 215. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE AD-
VANCED BATTLE MANAGEMENT SYS-
TEM.
It is the sense of the Senate that—
(1) the Senate supports the vision of the
Air Force for the Advanced Battle Manage-
ment System (ABMS) as a system of systems
that can integrate air, space, and other sys-
tems to detect, track, target, and direct ef-
fects against threats in all domains;
(2) such a capability will be essential to
the ability of the Air Force to operate effec-
tively as part, and in support, of the Joint
Force, especially in the highly-contested op-
erating environments established by near-
peer competitors;
(3) the Senate is concerned that the Air
Force has not moved quickly enough over
the past year to begin defining the require-
ments and maturing the technologies that
will be essential for the Advanced Battle
Management System, especially in light of
the pending retirement of the Joint Surveil-
lance and Target Attack Radar System
(JSTARS) aircraft that the Advanced Battle
Management System is conceived, in part, to
replace;
(4) the Senate understands that the Air
Force is moving deliberately to analyze al-
ternative concepts for the Advanced Battle
Management System and adopt an architec-
tural approach to its design;
(5) the Advanced Battle Management Sys-
tem, as a multidomain system of systems,
must have a central command and control
capability that can integrate these systems
into a unified warfighting capability;
(6) emerging technologies, such as artifi-
cial intelligence and automated sensor fu-
sion, should be built into the command and
control capability for the Advanced Battle
Management System from the start;
(7) such technologies would improve the
ability of the Advanced Battle Management
System to support human operators with—
(A) the rapid processing and fusion of
multidomain sensor data;
(B) the highly-automated identification,
classification, tracking, and targeting of
threats in all domains;
(C) the creation of a real-time common op-
erating picture from multidomain intel-
ligence; and the ability to direct effects on
the battlefield at machine-to-machine speeds
from all of the systems comprising the Ad-
vanced Battle Management System; and
(8) for an effort as ambitious and complex
as the Advanced Battle Management Sys-
tem, the Senate encourages the Air Force to
use existing acquisition authorities to begin
a rapid prototyping effort to refine the re-
quirements and software-intensive tech-
nologies that will be integral to the com-

fifth-generation wireless networks will pro-
vide the high speed and capacity necessary
for the Internet of Things, advanced manu-
facturing, autonomous machines, the appli-
cation of artificial intelligence, and smart
cities, and it is critical that the Department
of Defense utilize these new capabilities;
(3) protecting the innovation and tech-
nology that enables these revolutionary de-
velopments is essential for security of the

students;

ing Corps units in all 50 States, 4 United
States territories, and the District of Colum-
bia;

Corps consistently improves student out-
comes across a wide variety of academic and
nonacademic data points, including grade
point average, high school graduation and
college acceptance rates, standardized test
scores, drop-out rates, discipline problems,
and leadership skills;

as a unique program to help close the divide
between the military and the greater civil-
ian community in the United States;
(5) given the increased funding and more
flexible policy authorized in the John S.
McCain National Defense Authorization Act

tion to increase the number of Junior Re-

least 3,700 in order to relieve a significant

contractors to disclose to the Defense Secu-
rity Service, or its successor organization,
their beneficial ownership and whether they
are under FOCI.
(ii) A requirement to update such disclo-
sures when significant changes occur to in-
formation previously provided, consistent
with or similar to the procedures for updat-
ing FOCI information under the National In-
dustrial Security Program.
(iii) A requirement for covered contractors
and subcontractors determined to be under
FOCI to disclose contact information for
each of its foreign owners that is a beneficial
owner.

making responsibility determinations re-
garding whether covered contractors and
subcontractors may be under foreign owner-
ship, control, or influence and for deter-
mining whether there is reason to believe
that such foreign ownership, control, or in-
fluence would pose a risk to national secu-
rity or potential risk of compromise because
of sensitive data, systems, or processes, such
as personally identifiable information, cy-
bersecurity, or national security systems in-
volved with the contract or subcontract; and
(iii) modification of policies, directives,
and practices to provide that an assessment
that a covered contractor or subcontractor is
under FOCI may be a sufficient basis for a
contracting officer to determine that a con-
tractor or subcontractor is not responsible.

June 24, 2019
SEC. 1041. DESIGNATION OF DEPARTMENT OF DE-
FENSE STRATEGIC ARCTIC PORTS.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) The strategic importance of the Arctic
continues to increase as the United States
and other countries recognize the military
significance of the sea lanes and choke
points within the region and understand the
potential for power projection from the Arc-
tic into multiple regions.
(2) On January 19, 2018, Secretary of De-
fense James Mattis released the document
titled ‘‘2018 National Defense Strategy of the
United States of America’’ in which the Sec-
retary outlined the reemergence of long-
term, strategic competition by countries
classified by the National Security Strategy
as revisionist powers.
(3) Russia and China have conducted mili-
tary exercises together in the Arctic, have
agreed to connect the Northern Sea Route,
claimed by Russia, with China’s Maritime
Silk Road, and are working together in de-
veloping natural gas resources in the Arctic.
(4) The Government of the Russian Federa-
tion—
(A) has prioritized the development of Arc-
tic capabilities and has made significant in-
vestments in military infrastructure in the
Arctic, including the creation of a new Arc-
tic Command and the construction or refur-
bishment of 16 deepwater ports and 14 air-
fields in the region;
(B) has approximately 40 icebreakers as of
May 2019, including several nuclear-powered
icebreakers, is currently constructing four
icebreakers, and is planning to build an addi-
tional eight icebreakers; and
(C) conducted the largest military exercise
since the 1980s, Vostok 2018, which included—
(i) 300,000 troops;
(ii) 1,000 aircraft;
(iii) 80 ships;
(iv) 36,000 vehicles; and
(v) notably, 3,200 Chinese troops, 30 Chinese
rotary and fixed-wing aircraft, and 900 Chi-
nese tanks.
(5) The Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China—
(A) released, in January 2018, its new Arc-
tic Strategy, the Polar Silk Road, in which
it declares itself as a ‘‘near-Arctic state’’,
even though its nearest territory to the Arc-
tic is 900 miles away;
(B) has publicly stated that it seeks to ex-
pand its ‘‘Belt and Road Initiative’’ to the
Arctic region, including current investment
in the natural gas fields in the Yamal Penin-
sula in Russia, rare-earth element mines in
Greenland, and the real estate, alternative
energy, and fisheries in Iceland; and
(C) has shown great interest in expanding
its Arctic presence, including through—
(i) the operation of research vessels in the
region;
(ii) the recent construction of the Xuelong
2, or Snow Dragon II, the only polar research
boat vessel in the world that can break ice
while going forward or backward;
(iii) a freedom of navigation operation in
the Aleutian Islands in 2015; and
(iv) its recent plans to develop a 33,000 ton
nuclear-powered icebreaker.
(6) The economic significance of the Arctic
continues to grow as countries around the
globe begin to understand the potential for
maritime transportation through, and eco-
nomic and trade development in, the region.
(7) The Arctic is home to 13 percent of the
world’s undiscovered oil, 30 percent of its un-
discovered gas, an abundance of uranium,
rare earth minerals, gold, diamonds, and mil-
lions of square miles of untapped resources,
including abundant fisheries.
(8) The Bering Strait is experiencing sig-
nificant increases in international traffic
from vessels transiting the Northern Sea
Route, increases which are projected to con-
tinue if decreases in sea ice coverage con-
tinue.
(9) Along a future ice-free Arctic shipping
route, a ship sailing from South Korea to
Germany would have an average travel time
of just 23 days, compared to 34 days via the
Suez Canal and 46 days via the Cape of Good
Hope.
(10) In a speech at the Arctic Forum in
September 2011, Russian Federation Presi-
dent Vladimir Putin highlighted the North-
ern Sea Route as a potential alternative to
the Suez Canal and has publicly stated plans
to invest $11,400,000,000 along the Northern
Sea Route by 2024.
(11) Increases in human, maritime, and re-
source development activity in the Arctic re-
gion are expected to create additional mis-
sion requirements for the Department of De-
fense and the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity, given—
(A) the strategic focus of the Government
of the Russian Federation and the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China on
the Arctic;
(B) overlapping territorial claims; and
(C) the potential for maritime accidents,
oil spills, and illegal fishing near the exclu-
sive economic zone of the United States.
(12) The increasing role of the United
States in the Arctic has been highlighted in
each of the last four National Defense Au-
thorization Acts.
(13) Section 1068 of the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (Pub-
lic Law 114–92; 129 Stat. 992) required a new
Department of Defense strategy to protect
United States national security interests in
the Arctic region.
(14) Section 1095 of the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Pub-
lic Law 114–328; 130 Stat. 2438) required the
Department of Defense to create criteria to
designate a Department of Defense Strategic
Arctic Port.
(15) Section 122 of the National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (Public
Law 115–91; 131 Stat. 1310) authorized the pro-
curement of one polar-class heavy icebreaker
vessel.
(16) Section 151 of the John S. McCain Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232) authorized the
procurement of five additional polar-class
icebreaker vessels and expressed that the
Coast Guard should—
(A) maintain an inventory of not fewer
than six polar-class icebreaker vessels;
(B) award a contract for the first new
polar-class icebreaker not later than fiscal
year 2019 and deliver the icebreaker not later
than fiscal year 2023; and
(C) deliver the second through sixth polar-
class icebreakers at a rate of one vessel per
year in fiscal years 2025 through 2029.
(17) In January 2017, the Department of De-
fense released a report entitled ‘‘Report to
Congress on Strategy to Protect United
States National Security Interests in the
Arctic Region’’ to update ‘‘the ways and
means’’ the Department of Defense intends
to use to achieve its objectives as it imple-
ments the 2013 National Strategy for the
Arctic Region, including—
(A) enhancing the capability of United
States forces to defend the homeland and ex-
ercise sovereignty;
(B) strengthening deterrence at home and
abroad;
(C) preserving freedom of the seas in the
Arctic; and
(D) evolving the infrastructure and capa-
bilities of the Department in the Arctic con-
sistent with changing conditions and needs.
(18) The United States Coast Guard Arctic
Strategic Outlook released in April 2019
states, ‘‘Demonstrating commitment to
operational presence, Canada, Denmark, and
Norway have made strategic investments in
ice-capable patrol ships charged with na-
tional or homeland security missions. [The
United States] is the only Arctic State that
has not made similar investments in ice-ca-
pable surface maritime security assets. This
limits the ability of the Coast Guard, and
the Nation, to credibly uphold sovereignty or
respond to contingencies in the Arctic’’.
(19) On January 12, 2017, Secretary of De-
fense James Mattis stated, ‘‘The Arctic is
key strategic terrain . . . Russia is taking
aggressive steps to increase its presence
there . . . I will prioritize the development of
an integrated strategy for the Arctic. I be-
lieve that our interests and the security of
the Arctic would benefit from increasing the
focus of the Department of Defense on this
region’’.
(20) On January 9, 2019, Secretary of the
Air Force Heather Wilson and Chief of Staff
of the Air Force General David Goldfein
wrote, ‘‘. . . the Arctic has become even
more important to the nation. Both a north-
ern approach to the United States, as well as
a critical location for projecting American
power, its geo-strategic significance is dif-
ficult to overstate’’.
(21) On February 26, 2019, General John
Hyten, Commander of the United States
Strategic Command, stated, ‘‘In particular,
the Arctic is an area that we really need to
focus on and really look at investing. That is
no longer a buffer zone. We need to be able to
operate there. We need to be able to commu-
nicate there. We need to have a presence
there that we have not invested in in the
same way that our adversaries have. And
they see that as a vulnerability from us,
whereas it is becoming a strength for them
and it is a weakness for us, we need to flip
that equation’’.
(22) On February 26, 2019, General Terrence
O’Shaughnessy, Commander of the United
States Northern Command stated, ‘‘It has
become clear that defense of the homeland
depends on our ability to detect and defeat
threats operating both in the Arctic and
passing through the Arctic. Russia’s fielding
of advanced, long-range cruise missiles capa-
ble of flying through the northern ap-
proaches and striking targets in the United
States and Canada has emerged as the domi-
nant military threat in the Arctic. . . .
Meanwhile, China has declared that it is not
content to remain a mere observer in the
Arctic and has taken action to normalize its
naval and commercial presence in the region
in order to increase its access to lucrative
resources and shipping routes. I view the
Arctic as the front line in the defense of the
United States and Canada . . .’’.
(23) On May 6, 2019, Admiral Karl Schultz,
Commandant of the Coast Guard stated, ‘‘We
talk about the Arctic as a competitive space.
We’ve seen China, we see Russia investing
extensively. China built icebreakers in the
time since we updated our strategy. China’s
been operating off the Alaskan Arctic for a
good part of the last six years on an annual
basis. [The Coast Guard is] championing in-
creased capabilities in the Arctic . . . better
communications, better domain awareness
. . . . I want to see the Arctic remain a
peaceful domain. China’s a self-declared Arc-
tic state. They’re not one of the eight Arctic
nations, so for me, for the service, its pres-
ence equals influence’’.
(24) On May 6, 2019, Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo stated that—
(A) the Arctic ‘‘has become an arena for
power and for competition’’, and the United
States is ‘‘entering a new age of strategic en-
gagement in the Arctic, complete with new
threats to the Arctic and its real estate, and
to all of our interests in that region.’’;

(B) ‘‘Arctic sea lanes could become the 21st
century Suez and Panama Canals.’’;
(C) ‘‘We’re concerned about Russia’s claim
over the international waters of the North-
ern Sea Route, including its newly an-
nounced plans to connect it with China’s
Maritime Silk Road.’’;
(D) ‘‘In the Northern Sea Route, Moscow
already illegally demands other nations re-
quest permission to pass, requires Russian
maritime pilots to be aboard foreign ships,
and threatens to use military force to sink
any that fail to comply with their de-
mands.’’;
(E) there is a ‘‘pattern of aggressive Rus-
sian behavior here in the Arctic’’ and ‘‘we
know Russian territorial ambitions can turn
violent’’; and
(F) we do not want ‘‘the Arctic Ocean to
transform into a new South China Sea,
fraught with militarization and competing
territorial claims’’, nor do we want ‘‘the
fragile Arctic environment exposed to the
same ecological devastation caused by Chi-
na’s fishing fleet in the seas off its coast, or
unregulated industrial activity in its own
country’’.
(25) On December 6, 2018, Secretary of the
Navy Richard Spencer stated, ‘‘We need to
have a strategic Arctic port up in Alaska. We
need to be doing FONOPs in the northwest –
in the northern passage. . . . peace through
presence with a submarine is a little tough’’.
(26) Meanwhile, the two closest strategic
seaports, as designated by the Department of
Defense, to the Arctic Circle are the Port of
Anchorage and the Port of Tacoma, located
approximately 1,500 nautical miles and 2,400
nautical miles away, respectively, and ap-
proximately 1,900 nautical miles and 2,800
nautical miles respectively from Barrow,
Alaska.
(27) The distance from Bangor, Maine, to
Key West, Florida, is approximately 1,450
nautical miles.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) the Arctic is a region of strategic im-
portance to the national security interests of
the United States and the Department of De-
fense must better align its presence, force
posture, and capabilities to meet the grow-
ing array of challenges in the region; and
(2) although much progress has been made
to increase awareness of Arctic issues and to
promote increased presence in the region,
additional measures, including the designa-
tion of one or more strategic Arctic ports,
are needed to show the commitment of the
United States to this emerging strategic
choke point of future great power competi-
tion.

SEC. 1245. SENSE OF SENATE ON UNITED STATES
FORCE POSTURE IN EUROPE AND

identifies long-term strategic competition
with the Russian Federation as a principal
priority for the Department of Defense that
requires increased and sustained investment;
(2) despite significant progress through the
European Deterrence Initiative, the current
force posture of the United States is not yet
sufficient to support the National Defense
Strategy;
(3) due to the geostrategic location and ca-
pabilities of the armed forces of the Republic
of Poland, the Republic of Poland is critical
to deterring, defending against, and defeat-
ing Russian aggression against North Atlan-
tic Treaty Organization allies in Central and
Eastern Europe; and
(4) the United States should increase the
persistent presence of United States forces in
the Republic of Poland, including key com-

unilateral actions that would seek to under-
mine their administration by Japan;
(3) the unilateral actions of a third party
will not affect United States acknowledg-
ment of the administration of Japan over the

respond to any armed attack in the terri-
tories under the administration of Japan;

to regional security and prosperity that

and record investments in advanced defense
capabilities in the maritime, air, space, and

SEC. 1677. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON RECENT
MISSILE DEFENSE AGENCY TESTS.
It is the Sense of the Senate that the Of-
fice of the Under Secretary of Defense for
Research and Engineering, the Missile De-
fense Agency, the Office of the Director for
Operational Test and Evaluation, the oper-
ational test agencies, the military depart-
ments, and warfighters should—
(1) be strongly commended for a highly
successful 2018 flight test campaign, which
consisted of 13 total flight test events includ-
ing—
(A) FTX–35, which successfully proved
interoperability between Terminal High Al-
titude Area Defense (THAAD) and the
Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept
on Target (PATRIOT) to detect and track a
simulated engagement with a short-range
ballistic missile;
(B) Pacific Dragon 2018, which successfully
demonstrated joint ballistic missile defense
interoperability with Japan and Korea to en-
gage a short-range ballistic missile with a
Standard Missile 3 (SM–3) Block IB by a Jap-
anese ship and an Aegis Ashore site;
(C) JFTM–5, which successfully dem-
onstrated the intercept of an short-range
ballistic missile with a Standard Missile 3
Block IB threat upgrade from a Japanese
ship;
(D) FTM–45, which successfully dem-
onstrated the intercept of a medium-range
ballistic missile with a Standard Missile 3
Block IIA from a United States ship; and
(E) FTI–03, which as a part of the oper-
ational test of the European Phased Adapt-
ive Approach (EPAA) Phase 3 architecture,
successfully demonstrated the intercept of
an intermediate-range ballistic missile using
the Aegis Weapon System’s Engage-on-Re-
mote capability; and
(2) be especially recognized for the success
of FTG-11, the first salvo test of the United
States of the Ground-based Midcourse De-
fense system, during which two ground-based
interceptors were launched nearly simulta-
neously from the same location and success-
fully intercepted the kill vehicle of a threat-
representative intercontinental ballistic
missile target, and then the next most lethal
object.
SEC. 1678. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MISSILE
DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOP-
MENT PRIORITIES.
It is the sense of the Senate that—
(1) the 2019 Missile Defense Review articu-
lates a comprehensive approach to pre-
venting and defeating the rapidly expanding
offensive missile threat through a combina-
tion of deterrence, active and passive missile
defense, and attack operations;
(2) to counter the expanding offense mis-
sile capabilities of potential adversaries and
hedge against unanticipated missile threats,
the Secretary of Defense should aggressively
pursue new missile defense capabilities and
examine concepts and technologies for ad-
vanced missile defense systems;
(3) the Secretary should fully implement
the 2019 Missile Defense Review’s focus on in-
creasing investments in and deploying new
technologies and concepts; and
(4) the Secretary should work to ensure
that all missile defense systems are more
survivable, including through—
(A) more distributed air and missile de-
fense operations; and
(B) improved camouflage, concealment,
and deception, including emission control.
SEC. 1679. PUBLICATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IM-
PACT STATEMENT PREPARED FOR
CERTAIN POTENTIAL FUTURE MIS-
SILE DEFENSE SITES.
The Secretary of Defense shall make avail-
able to the public the environmental impact
statement prepared pursuant to section
227(b) of the National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (126 Stat. 1679; Pub-
lic Law 112–239).

if left unaddressed, would hamper the readi-
ness and ability of the Armed Forces of the
United States to conduct operations glob-
ally;
(4) since the military departments have
not shown a strong commitment to funding

of 65 Military Entrance Processing Stations
(MEPS) dispersed throughout the contiguous
United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto

est Processing Station are often driven by

processed 473,000 applicants at its Processing
Stations, with an aggregate total of 931,000

essing Command to reduce costly and ineffi-
cient return visits by applicants to Military

SEC. 6013. REPORT ON IMPACT OF LIBERIAN NA-
TIONALS ON THE NATIONAL SECU-
RITY, FOREIGN POLICY, AND ECO-
NOMIC AND HUMANITARIAN INTER-
ESTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND A
JUSTIFICATION FOR ADJUSTMENT
OF STATUS OF QUALIFYING LIBE-
RIANS TO THAT OF LAWFUL PERMA-
NENT RESIDENTS.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) In 1989, a seven-year civil war broke out
in Liberia that—
(A) claimed the lives of an estimated
200,000 people;
(B) displaced over 1⁄2 of the Liberian popu-
lation;
(C) halted food production; and
(D) destroyed the infrastructure and econ-
omy of Liberia.
(2) A second civil war then followed from
1999 to 2003, further destabilizing Liberia and
creating more turmoil and hardship for Libe-
rians.
(3) In total, the two civil wars in Liberia
killed up to an estimated 1⁄4 million individ-
uals.
(4) From 2014 to 2016, Liberia faced an
Ebola virus outbreak that devastated the
fragile health system of Liberia and killed
nearly 5,000 individuals.
(5) As a result of these devastating events,
thousands of Liberians sought refuge in the
United States, living and working here under
Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and De-
ferred Enforced Departure (DED), extended
under both Republican and Democratic ad-
ministrations beginning in 1991 with the ad-
ministration of President George H. W. Bush.
(6) These law-abiding and taxpaying Libe-
rians have made homes in the United States,
have worked hard, played by the rules, paid
their dues, and submitted to rigorous vet-
ting. Many such Liberians have United
States citizen children who have served in
the Armed Forces, and in some cases have
themselves served in that capacity.
(7) The Liberian community in the United
States has also contributed greatly to pri-
vate sector investment and socioeconomic
assistance in Liberia by providing remit-
tances to relatives in Liberia.
(8) While there was a positive development
in 2017 with the first democratic transfer of
power in more than 70 years, the Department
of State has identified the capital and most
populous city of Liberia, Monrovia, as being
a critical-threat location for crime. Access
to healthcare remains limited, critical infra-
structure is lacking, and widespread corrup-
tion coupled with low wages and a weak eco-
nomic recovery has left the country vulner-
able to civil unrest.
(b) REPORT.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than December
31, 2019, the Secretary of Defense, in con-
sultation with the Secretary of State, shall
submit to the congressional defense commit-
tees a report on the impact of Liberian na-
tionals on the national security, foreign pol-
icy, and economic, and humanitarian inter-
ests of the United States and a justification
for adjustment of status of qualifying Libe-
rians to that of lawful permanent residents.
(2) ELEMENTS.—The report required by
paragraph (1) shall include the following:
(A) The number of current or former Libe-
rian nationals and their children who have
served or are currently serving in the Armed
Forces.
(B) The amount of remittances sent by cur-
rent or former Liberian nationals to rel-
atives in Liberia and an assessment of the
impact on the economic development of Li-
beria if these remittances were to cease.
(C) The economic and tax contributions
that Liberian nationals and their children
have made to the United States.
(D) An assessment of the impact on the
United States of adjusting the status of Li-
berian nationals who have continuous phys-
ical presence in the United States beginning
on November 20, 2014, and ending on the date
of the enactment of this Act, or for adjusting
the status of the spouses, children, and un-
married sons or daughters of such Liberian
nationals.
(c) QUALIFYING LIBERIAN.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—In this section, the term
‘‘qualifying Liberian’’ means and alien (as
defined in section 101(a) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)) who—
(A)(i) is a national of Liberia; and
(ii) has been continuously present in the
United States during the period beginning on
November 20, 2014, and ending on the date of
the enactment of this Act;
(B) is the spouse, child, or unmarried son
or daughter of an alien described in subpara-
graph (A);
(C) is otherwise eligible to receive an im-
migrant visa; and
(D) is admissible to the United States for
permanent residence, except that the
grounds of inadmissibility specified in para-
graphs (4), (5), (6)(A), and (7)(A) of section
212(a) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)) shall not apply.
(2) EXCEPTIONS.—The term ‘‘qualifying Li-
berian’’ does not include any alien who—
(A) has been convicted of any aggravated
felony;
(B) has been convicted of 2 or more crimes
involving moral turpitude (other than a
purely political offense); or
(C) has ordered, incited, assisted, or other-
wise participated in the persecution of any
person on account of race, religion, nation-
ality, membership in a particular social
group, or political opinion.
(3) DETERMINATION OF CONTINUOUS PHYSICAL
PRESENCE.—For purposes of establishing the
period of continuous physical presence re-
ferred to in paragraph (1)(A)(ii), an alien
shall not be considered to have failed to
maintain continuous physical presence based
on 1 or more absences from the United
States for 1 or more periods amounting, in
the aggregate, to not more than 180 days.

of the United States that—

ed an approach that takes no position on the

ereignty claims in the South China Sea, dis-
puting States should—
(A) resolve their disputes peacefully with-
out the threat or use of force; and
(B) ensure that their maritime claims are
consistent with international law; and
(2) an attack on the armed forces, public
vessels, or aircraft of the Republic of the
Philippines in the Pacific, including the
South China Sea, would trigger the mutual
defense obligations of the United States
under Article IV of the Mutual Defense Trea-
ty between the Republic of the Philippines
and the United States of America, done at
Washington August 30, 1951, ‘‘to meet com-
mon dangers in accordance with its constitu-
tional processes’’.
(b) SENSE OF SENATE.—It is the sense of the
Senate that the Secretary of State and the
Secretary of Defense should—
(1) affirm the commitment of the United
States to the Mutual Defense Treaty be-
tween the United States and the Republic of
the Philippines;

the United States with the Republic of the
Philippines;
(3) prioritize efforts to develop a shared un-

COUNTRIES TO ESTABLISH OPEN-
SOURCE INTELLIGENCE FUSION

GION.

(1) the Pacific Island countries in the Indo-
Pacific region are critical partners of the
United States;
(2) the United States should take steps to
enhance collaboration with Pacific Island
countries;
(3) United States Indo-Pacific Command
should pursue the establishment of one or
more open-source intelligence fusion centers
in the Indo-Pacific region to enhance co-
operation with Pacific Island countries,
which may include participation in an exist-
ing fusion center of a partner or ally in lieu
of establishing an entirely new fusion center;

support the political, economic, and security
partnerships among Australia, New Zealand,

(1) allowing for the export, re-export or

prus would advance United States security

place unless the President determines and

than the manner set forth in section 240.13d–
3 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations (as
in effect on the date of the enactment of this
Act); and
(B) based on a threshold, to be determined
by the Secretary, based on an assessment of
whether the person’s position would give the
person an opportunity to control the use of a
satellite described in section 1261(c)(1) of the
National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-
cal Year 2013 and exported, reexported, or
transferred in country to the entity.
(c) ELEMENTS.—The report required by sub-
section (a) shall include the following:
(1) An evaluation of whether satellites de-
scribed in section 1261(c)(1) of the National

rectly, to entities described in subsection

tional security of the potential export, reex-
port, or in-country transfer of satellites in
compliance with section 1261(c) of the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal

ices, bandwidth, or functions of the satellites
could subsequently be leased or sold to, or
otherwise used by, an entity described in

tional security of not limiting the export, re-
export, or in-country transfer of such sat-
ellites to entities described in subsection (b).

ment of the effectiveness of, a licensing con-
dition that would prohibit or limit the ex-
port, reexport, or in-country transfer of such
satellites to, or the use of such satellites by,
entities described in subsection (b).
(5) An assessment, based on realistic and
justifiable assumptions and forecasts, of the
economic implications of and potential harm
caused by a licensing condition described in

cluding any costs identified under paragraph
(3).

(B) when evaluating such a decision—
(i) to have full knowledge of the potential
end-user of the satellite and the current ben-

WARD HONG KONG.

Kong is guided by the United States-Hong
Kong Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102–383;

Kong Special Administrative Region of the

gree of autonomy on all matters other than
defense and foreign affairs.’’.
(2) The Act furthermore states that ‘‘The
human rights of the people of Hong Kong are
of great importance to the United States and
are directly relevant to United States inter-
ests in Hong Kong.’’.

U.S.C. 5731), the annual report issued by the
Department of State on developments in
Hong Kong (referred to in this section as the
‘‘Report’’), released on March 21, 2019, states

States Government and the Hong Kong gov-
ernment remains broad and effective in
many areas, providing significant benefits to
the United States economy and homeland se-
curity.’’.

mainland central government implemented

tonomy.’’.
(5) The Report furthermore states that the
‘‘Hong Kong authorities took actions aligned
with mainland priorities at the expense of
human rights and fundamental freedoms.
There were particular setbacks in demo-
cratic electoral processes, freedom of expres-
sion, and freedom of association.’’.
(6) On June 10, 2019, the spokesporson for
the Department of State issued a statement
expressing ‘‘grave concern about the Hong
Kong government’s proposed amendments to
its Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, which, if
passed, would permit Chinese authorities to
request the extradition of individuals to
mainland China.’’.

fenders Ordinance.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) the government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China and the Hong Kong Special Ad-
ministrative Region of the People’s Republic

pact the protections of fundamental human
rights, freedoms, and democratic values of
the people of Hong Kong, as enshrined in the
Act, Hong Kong’s Basic Law of 1997, and the
Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984;
(2) the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region of the People’s Republic of China au-
thorities should immediately withdraw from
consideration the proposed amendments to
its Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and refrain
from any unwarranted use of force against
the protestors that is inconsistent with
internationally recognized law enforcement
best practices; and
(3) the United States should impose finan-
cial sanctions, visa bans, and other punitive
economic measures against all individuals or
entities violating the fundamental human
rights and freedoms of the people of Hong
Kong, consistent with United States and
international law.

SEC. 6218. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ACQUISITION
BY TURKEY OF S–400 AIR DEFENSE
SYSTEM.
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) Turkey is an important North Atlantic
Treaty Organization ally and military part-
ner;
(2) the acquisition by the Government of
Turkey of the S–400 air defense system from
the Russian Federation—
(A) undermines—
(i) the security interests of the United
States; and
(ii) the air defense of Turkey;
(B) weakens the interoperability of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization; and
(C) is incompatible with the plan of the
Government of Turkey—
(i) to accept delivery of and operate the F–
35 aircraft; and
(ii) to continue to participate in F–35 air-
craft production and maintenance;
(3) the United States and other member
countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Orga-
nization have put forth several viable and
competitive proposals to protect the vulner-
able airspace of Turkey and to ensure the se-
curity and integrity of Turkey as a North
Atlantic Treaty Organization ally;
(4) Russian Federation aggression on the
periphery of Turkey, including in Georgia,
Ukraine, the Black Sea, and Syria, and espe-
cially the indiscriminate bombing by the
Russian Federation of the Idlib province of
Syria on the border of Turkey and the incur-
sions of Russian Federation warplanes into
the airspace of Turkey on November 24, 2015,
and other occasions, endangers the security
of Turkey;
(5) the termination of the participation of
Turkey in the F–35 program and supply
chain, which may still be avoided if the Gov-
ernment of Turkey abandons its planned ac-
quisition of the S–400 air defense system,
would cause significant harm to the growing
defense industry and economy of Turkey;
and
(6) if the Government of Turkey accepts
delivery of the S–400 air defense system—
(A) such acceptance would—
(i) constitute a significant transaction
within the meaning of section 231(a) of the
Countering Russian Influence in Europe and
Eurasia Act of 2017 (22 U.S.C. 9525(a));
(ii) endanger the integrity of the North At-
lantic Treaty Organization Alliance and pose
a significant threat to Turkey;
(iii) adversely affect ongoing operations of
the United States Armed Forces, including
coalition operations in which the United
States Armed Forces participate;
(iv) result in a significant impact to de-
fense cooperation between the United States
and Turkey; and
(v) significantly increase the risk of com-
promising United States defense systems and
operational capabilities; and
(B) the President should fully implement
the Countering Russian Influence in Europe
and Eurasia Act of 2017 (Public Law 115–44;
131 Stat. 886) by imposing and applying sanc-
tions under section 235 of that Act (22 U.S.C.

determined to have engaged in such signifi-

SEC. 6602. SENSE OF SENATE ON SUPPORT FOR A
ROBUST AND MODERN ICBM FORCE
TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF THE
NUCLEAR TRIAD OF THE UNITED
STATES.
(a) FINDINGS.—The Senate makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) Land-based intercontinental ballistic
missiles (in this section referred to as
‘‘ICBMs’’) have been a critical part of the
strategic deterrent of the United States for 6
decades in conjunction with air and sea-
based strategic delivery systems.
(2) President John F. Kennedy referred to
the deployment of the first Minuteman mis-
sile during the Cuban Missile Crisis as his
‘‘ace in the hole’’.
(3) The Minuteman III missile entered
service in 1970 and is still deployed in 2019,
well beyond its originally intended service
life.
(4) The ICBM force of the United States
peaked at more than 1,200 deployed missiles
during the Cold War.
(5) The ICBM force of the United States
currently consists of approximately 400 Min-
uteman III missiles deployed across 450 oper-
ational missile silos, each carrying a single
warhead.
(6) The Russian Federation currently de-
ploys at least 300 ICBMs with multiple war-
heads loaded on each missile and has an-
nounced plans to replace its Soviet-era sys-
tems with modernized ICBMs.
(7) The People’s Republic of China cur-
rently deploys at least 75 ICBMs and plans to
grow its ICBM force through the deployment
of modernized, road-mobile ICBMs that carry
multiple warheads.
(8) The Russian Federation and the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China deploy nuclear weap-
ons across a variety of platforms in addition
to their ICBM forces.
(9) Numerous countries possess or are seek-
ing to develop nuclear weapons capabilities
that pose challenges to the nuclear deter-
rence of the United States.
(10) The nuclear deterrent of the United
States is comprised of a triad of delivery sys-
tems for nuclear weapons, including sub-
marine-launched ballistic missiles (in this
subsection referred to as ‘‘SLBMs’’), air-de-
livered gravity bombs and cruise missiles,
and land-based ballistic missiles that provide
interlocking and mutually reinforcing at-
tributes that enhance strategic deterrence.
(11) Weakening one leg of the triad limits
the deterrent value of the other legs of the
triad.
(12) In the nuclear deterrent of the United
States, ICBMs provide commanders with the
most prompt response capability, SLBMs
provide stealth and survivability, and air-
craft armed with nuclear weapons provide
flexibility.
(13) The ICBM force of the United States
forces any would-be attacker to confront
more than 400 discrete targets, thus creating
an effectively insurmountable targeting
problem for a potential adversary.
(14) The size, dispersal, and global reach of
the ICBM force of the United States ensures
that no adversary can escalate a crisis be-
yond the ability of the United States to re-
spond.
(15) A potential attacker would be forced
to expend far more warheads to destroy the
ICBMs of the United States than the United
States would lose in an attack, because of
the deployment of a single warhead on each
ICBM of the United States.
(16) The ICBM force provides a persistent
deterrent capability that reinforces strategic
stability.
(17) ICBMs are the cheapest delivery sys-
tem for nuclear weapons for the United
States to operate and maintain.
(18) United States Strategic Command has
validated military requirements for the
unique capabilities of ICBMs.
(19) In a 2014 analysis of alternatives, the
Air Force concluded that replacing the Min-
uteman III missile would provide upgraded
capabilities at lower cost when compared
with extending the service life of the Min-
uteman III missile.
(20) The Minuteman III replacement pro-
gram, known as the ground-based strategic
deterrent, is expected to provide a land-
based strategic deterrent capability for 5
decades after the program enters service.
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense
of the Senate that—
(1) land-based ICBMs have certain charac-
teristics, including responsiveness, persist-
ence, and dispersal, that enhance strategic
stability and magnify the deterrent value of
the air and sea-based legs of the nuclear
triad of the United States;
(2) ICBMs have played and continue to play
a role in deterring attacks on the United
States and its allies;
(3) while arms control agreements have re-
duced the size of the ICBM force of the
United States, adversaries of the United
States continue to enhance, enlarge, and
modernize their ICBM forces;
(4) the modernization of the ICBM force of
the United States through the ground-based
strategic deterrent program should be sup-
ported;
(5) ICBMs have the lowest operation, main-
tenance, and modernization costs of any part
of the nuclear deterrent of the United
States; and
(6) unilaterally reducing the size of the
ICBM force of the United States or delaying
the implementation of the ground-based
strategic deterrent program would degrade
the deterrent capabilities of a fully oper-
ational and modernized nuclear triad and
should not take place at the present time.

TITLE LXVIII—SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT
TO FOREIGN TRAFFICKERS OF ILLICIT
SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS
SEC. 6801. SHORT TITLE.
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Fentanyl
Sanctions Act’’.
SEC. 6802. FINDINGS.
Congress makes the following findings:
(1) The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention estimate that from September
2017 through September 2018 more than 48,200
people in the United States died from an
opioid overdose, with synthetic opioids (ex-
cluding methadone), contributing to a record
31,900 overdose deaths. While drug overdose
death estimates from methadone, semi-syn-
thetic opioids, and heroin have decreased in
recent months, overdose deaths from syn-
thetic opioids have continued to increase.
(2) Congress and the President have taken
a number of actions to combat the demand
for illicit opioids in the United States, in-
cluding enacting into law the SUPPORT for
Patients and Communities Act (Public Law
115–271; 132 Stat. 3894). While new statutes
and regulations have reduced the rate of
opioid prescriptions in recent years, fully ad-
dressing the United States opioid crisis will
involve dramatically restricting the foreign
supply of illicit opioids.
(3) The People’s Republic of China is the
world’s largest producer of illicit fentanyl,
fentanyl analogues, and their immediate pre-
cursors. From the People’s Republic of
China, those substances are shipped pri-
marily through express consignment carriers
or international mail directly to the United
States, or, alternatively, shipped directly to
transnational criminal organizations in Mex-
ico, Canada, and the Caribbean.
(4) The United States and the People’s Re-
public of China, Mexico, and Canada have
made important strides in combating the il-
licit flow of opioids through bilateral efforts
of their respective law enforcement agencies.
(5) The objective of preventing the pro-
liferation of illicit opioids though existing
multilateral and bilateral initiatives re-
quires additional efforts to deny illicit ac-
tors the financial means to sustain their
markets and distribution networks.
(6) The implementation on May 1, 2019, of
the regulations of the People’s Republic of
China to schedule all fentanyl analogues as
controlled substances is a major step in com-
bating global opioid trafficking and rep-
resents a major achievement in United
States-China law enforcement dialogues.
However, that step will effectively fulfill the
commitment that President Xi Jinping of
the People’s Republic of China made to
President Donald Trump at the Group of
Twenty meeting in December 2018 only if the
Government of the People’s Republic of
China devotes sufficient resources to full im-
plementation and strict enforcement of the
new regulations. The effective enforcement
of the new regulations should result in di-
minished trafficking of illicit fentanyl origi-
nating from the People’s Republic of China

into the United States, so it is in the inter-
ests of both the United States and the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China to support the effec-
tive enforcement of the regulations.
(7) While the Department of the Treasury
used the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designa-
tion Act (21 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) to sanction
the first synthetic opioid trafficking entity
in April 2018, additional economic and finan-
cial sanctions policy tools are needed to help
combat the flow of synthetic opioids into the
United States.
SEC. 6803. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) the United States should apply eco-
nomic and other financial sanctions to for-
eign traffickers of illicit opioids to protect
the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States and the health
of the people of the United States;
(2) it is imperative that the People’s Re-
public of China follow through on full imple-
mentation of the new regulations, adopted
May 1, 2019, to treat all fentanyl analogues
as controlled substances under the laws of
the People’s Republic of China, including by
devoting sufficient resources for implemen-
tation and strict enforcement of the new reg-
ulations; and
(3) the effective enforcement of the new
regulations should result in diminished traf-
ficking of illicit fentanyl originating from
the People’s Republic of China into the
United States, so it is in the interests of
both the United States and the People’s Re-
public of China to support full, effective, and
strict enforcement of the regulations.

(L) require member countries of the United
Nations to seize, inspect, and impound any
ship in its jurisdiction that is suspected of
violating Security Council resolutions with
respect to North Korea and to interdict and
inspect all cargo heading to or from North
Korea by land, sea, or air;
(M) limit the transfer to North Korea of re-
fined petroleum products and crude oil;
(N) ban the sale or transfer to North Korea
of industrial machinery, transportation vehi-
cles, electronics, iron, steel, and other met-
als;
(O) reduce North Korean diplomatic staff
numbers in member countries of the United
Nations and expel any North Korean dip-
lomats found to be working on behalf of a
person subject to sanctions or assisting in
sanctions evasion;
(P) limit North Korean diplomatic mis-
sions abroad with respect to staff size and
access to banking privileges and prohibit
commerce from being conducted out of North
Korean consular or diplomatic offices;
(Q) require member states of the United
Nations to close representative offices, sub-
sidiaries, and bank accounts in North Korea;
(R) prohibit countries from providing or re-
ceiving military training to or from North
Korea or hosting North Koreans for special-
ized teaching or training that could con-
tribute to the programs of North Korea re-
lated to the development of weapons of mass
destruction;
(S) ban countries from granting landing
and flyover rights to North Korean aircraft;
and
(T) prohibit trade in statuary of North Ko-
rean origin.
(2) The Government of North Korea has
threatened to carry out nuclear attacks
against the United States, South Korea, and
Japan.
(3) The Government of North Korea tested
its sixth and largest nuclear device on Sep-
tember 3, 2017.
(4) According to a report by the Inter-
national Atomic Energy Agency released in
August 2018, ‘‘The continuation and further
development of the DPRK’s nuclear pro-
gramme and related statements by the
DPRK are a cause for grave concern. The
DPRK’s nuclear activities, including those in
relation to the Yongbyon Experimental Nu-
clear Power Plant (5 MW(e)) reactor, the use
of the building which houses the reported
centrifuge enrichment facility and the con-
struction at the light water reactor, as well
as the DPRK’s sixth nuclear test, are clear
violations of relevant UN Security Council
resolutions, including resolution 2375 (2017)
and are deeply regrettable.’’.
(5) In July 2018, Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo testified to the Committee on For-
eign Relations of the Senate that North
Korea ‘‘continue[s] to produce fissile mate-
rial’’ despite public pledges by North Korean
leader Kim Jong-un to denuclearize.
(6) The 2019 Missile Defense Review con-
ducted by the Department of Defense states
that North Korea ‘‘continues to pose an ex-
traordinary threat and the United States
must remain vigilant. In the past, North
Korea frequently issued explicit nuclear mis-
sile threats against the United States and al-
lies, all the while working aggressively to
field the capability to strike the U.S. home-
land with nuclear-armed ballistic missiles.
Over the past decade, it has invested consid-
erable resources in its nuclear and ballistic
missile programs, and undertaken extensive
nuclear and missile testing in order to real-
ize the capability to threaten the U.S. home-
land with missile attack. As a result, North
Korea has neared the time when it could
credibly do so.’’.
(7) Financial transactions and investments
that provide financial resources to the Gov-
ernment of North Korea, and that fail to in-
corporate adequate safeguards against the
misuse of those financial resources, pose an
undue risk of contributing to—
(A) weapons of mass destruction programs
of that Government; and
(B) efforts to evade restrictions required by
the United Nations Security Council on im-
ports or exports of arms and related mate-
riel, services, or technology by that Govern-
ment.
(8) The Federal Bureau of Investigation has
determined that the Government of North
Korea was responsible for cyberattacks
against entities in the United States, South
Korea, and around the world.
(9) In November 2017, President Donald
Trump designated the government of North
Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism pursu-
ant to authorities under the Export Adminis-
tration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et
seq.), as continued in effect at the time
under the International Emergency Eco-
nomic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)),
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C.
2151 et seq.), and the Arms Export Control
Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.);
(10) On February 22, 2018, the Secretary of
State determined that the Government of
North Korea was responsible for the lethal
nerve agent attack in 2017 on Kim Jong Nam,
the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim
Jong-un, in Malaysia, triggering sanctions
required under the Chemical and Biological
Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination
Act of 1991 (22 U.S.C. 5601 et seq.).
(11) The strict enforcement of sanctions is
essential to the efforts of the international
community to achieve the peaceful, com-
plete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantle-
ment of weapons of mass destruction pro-
grams of the Government of North Korea.
SEC. 6912. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) the United States is committed to
working with its allies and partners to halt
the nuclear and ballistic missile programs of
North Korea through a policy of maximum
pressure and diplomatic engagement;
(2) the imposition of sanctions, including
those under this title, should not be con-
strued to limit the authority of the Presi-
dent to fully engage in diplomatic negotia-
tions to further the policy objective de-
scribed in paragraph (1);
(3) the successful use of sanctions to halt
the nuclear and ballistic missile programs of
North Korea is part of a broader diplomatic
and economic strategy that relies on effec-
tive coordination among relevant Federal
agencies and officials, as well as with inter-
national partners of the United States; and
(4) the coordination described in paragraph
(3) should include proper vetting of external
messaging and communications from all
parts of the Executive branch to ensure that
those communications are an intentional
component of and aligned with the strategy
of the United States with respect to North
Korea.

if—
(A) the fiduciary makes that determina-
tion using credible information that is avail-
able to the public; and

that the result of that divestment or avoid-
ance of investment would not be expected to
provide the employee benefit plan with—

investments with commensurate rates of re-
turn; and
(2) by divesting assets or avoiding the in-

sibilities, obligations, or duties imposed
upon the fiduciary by subparagraph (A) or

tirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29

ment to issue and enforce rules governing

nancial institution subject to its jurisdic-
tion; or
(2) the regulation and taxation by the sev-
eral States of the business of insurance, pur-
suant to the Act of March 9, 1945 (59 Stat. 33,
chapter 20; 15 U.S.C. 1011 et seq.) (commonly
known as the ‘‘McCarran-Ferguson Act’’).
Subtitle C—Financial Industry Guidance to
Halt Trafficking
SEC. 6961. SHORT TITLE.
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Finan-
cial Industry Guidance to Halt Trafficking
Act’’ or the ‘‘FIGHT Act’’.
SEC. 6962. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) The terms ‘‘human trafficking’’ and
‘‘trafficking in persons’’ are used inter-
changeably to describe crimes involving the
exploitation of a person for the purposes of
compelled labor or commercial sex through
the use of force, fraud, or coercion.
(2) According to the International Labour
Organization, there are an estimated
24,900,000 people worldwide who are victims
of forced labor, including human trafficking
victims in the United States.
(3) Human trafficking is perpetrated for fi-
nancial gain.
(4) According to the International Labour
Organization, of the estimated
$150,000,000,000 or more in global profits gen-
erated annually from human trafficking—
(A) approximately 2⁄3 are generated by com-
mercial sexual exploitation, exacted by fraud
or by force; and
(B) approximately 1⁄3 are generated by
forced labor.
(5) Most purchases of commercial sex acts
are paid for with cash, making trafficking
proceeds difficult to identify in the financial
system. Nonetheless, traffickers rely heavily
on access to financial institutions as des-
tinations for trafficking proceeds and as con-
duits to finance every step of the trafficking
process.
(6) Under section 1956 of title 18, United
States Code (relating to money laundering),
human trafficking is a ‘‘specified unlawful
activity’’ and transactions conducted with
proceeds earned from trafficking people, or
used to further trafficking operations, can be
prosecuted as money laundering offenses.
SEC. 6963. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) the President should aggressively apply,
as appropriate, existing sanctions for human
trafficking authorized under section 111 of
the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of
2000 (22 U.S.C. 7108);
(2) the Financial Crimes Enforcement Net-
work of the Department of the Treasury
should continue—
(A) to monitor reporting required under
subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United
States Code (commonly known as the ‘‘Bank
Secrecy Act’’) and to update advisories, as
warranted;
(B) to periodically review its advisories to
provide covered financial institutions, as ap-
propriate, with a list of new ‘‘red flags’’ for
identifying activities of concern, particu-
larly human trafficking;
(C) to encourage entities covered by the
advisories described in subparagraph (B) to
incorporate relevant elements provided in
the advisories into their current transaction
and account monitoring systems or in poli-
cies, procedures, and training on human traf-
ficking to enable financial institutions to
maintain ongoing efforts to examine trans-
actions and accounts;
(D) to use geographic targeting orders, as
appropriate, to impose additional reporting
and recordkeeping requirements under sec-
tion 5326(a) of title 31, United States Code, to
carry out the purposes of, and prevent eva-
sions of the Bank Secrecy Act; and
(E) to utilize the Bank Secrecy Act Advi-
sory Group and other relevant entities to
identify opportunities for nongovernmental
organizations to share relevant actionable
information on human traffickers’ use of the
financial sector for nefarious purposes;
(3) Federal banking regulators, the Depart-
ment of the Treasury, relevant law enforce-
ment agencies, and the Human Smuggling
and Trafficking Center, in partnership with
representatives from the United States fi-
nancial community, should adopt regular
forms of sharing information to disrupt
human trafficking, including developing pro-
tocols and procedures to share actionable in-
formation between and amongst covered in-
stitutions, law enforcement, and the United
States intelligence community;
(4) training front line bank and money
service business employees, school teachers,
law enforcement officers, foreign service offi-
cers, counselors, and the general public is an
important factor in identifying trafficking
victims;
(5) the Department of Homeland Security’s
Blue Campaign, training by the BEST Em-
ployers Alliance, and similar efforts by in-
dustry, human rights, and nongovernmental
organizations focused on human trafficking
provide good examples of current efforts to
educate employees of critical sectors to save
victims and disrupt trafficking networks;
(6) the President should intensify diplo-
matic efforts, bilaterally and in appropriate
international fora, such as the United Na-
tions, to develop and implement a coordi-
nated, consistent, multilateral strategy for
addressing the international financial net-
works supporting human trafficking; and
(7) in deliberations between the United
States Government and any foreign country,
including through participation in the
Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence
Units, regarding money laundering, corrup-
tion, and transnational crimes, the United
States Government should—

from human trafficking are being used to fa-
cilitate terrorist financing, corruption, or
other illicit financial crimes;
(B) encourage cooperation by foreign gov-
ernments and relevant international fora in

Force to update its July 2011 typology re-

money laundering risk arising from the traf-
ficking of human beings; and

cial Intelligence Units to study the extent to
which human trafficking operations are
being used for money laundering, terrorist fi-
nancing, or other illicit financial purposes.

planned stockpile life extension programs
will result in an unacceptable capability gap
to our deterrent posture.

SEC. 9404. ENCOURAGING COOPERATIVE AC-
TIONS TO DETECT AND COUNTER
FOREIGN INFLUENCE OPERATIONS.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) The Russian Federation, through mili-
tary intelligence units, also known as the
‘‘GRU’’, and Kremlin-linked troll organiza-
tions often referred to as the ‘‘Internet Re-
search Agency’’, deploy information warfare
operations against the United States, its al-
lies and partners, with the goal of advancing
the strategic interests of the Russian Fed-
eration.
(2) One line of effort deployed as part of
these information warfare operations is the
weaponization of social media platforms
with the goals of intensifying societal ten-
sions, undermining trust in governmental in-
stitutions within the United States, its allies
and partners in the West, and generally sow-
ing division, fear, and confusion.
(3) These information warfare operations
are a threat to the national security of the
United States and that of the allies and part-
ners of the United States. As Director of Na-
tional Intelligence Dan Coats stated, ‘‘These
actions are persistent, they are pervasive
and they are meant to undermine America’s
democracy.’’.
(4) These information warfare operations
continue to evolve and increase in sophis-
tication.
(5) Other foreign adversaries and hostile
non-state actors will increasingly adopt
similar tactics of deploying information war-
fare operations against the West.
(6) Technological advances, including arti-
ficial intelligence, will only make it more
difficult in the future to detect fraudulent
accounts, deceptive material posted on so-
cial media, and malign behavior on social
media platforms.
(7) Because these information warfare op-
erations are deployed within and across pri-
vate social media platforms, the companies
that own these platforms have a responsi-
bility to detect and remove foreign adver-
sary networks operating clandestinely on
their platforms.
(8) The social media companies are inher-
ently technologically sophisticated and
adept at rapidly analyzing large amounts of
data and developing software-based solutions
to diverse and ever-changing challenges on

their platforms, which makes them well-
equipped to address the threat occurring on
their platforms.
(9) Independent analyses confirmed Krem-
lin-linked threat networks, based on data
provided by several social media companies
to the Select Committee on Intelligence of
the Senate, thereby demonstrating that it is
possible to discern both broad patterns of
cross-platform information warfare oper-
ations and specific fraudulent behavior on
social media platforms.
(10) General Paul Nakasone, Director of
the National Security Agency, emphasized
the importance of these independent anal-
yses to the planning and conduct of military
cyber operations to frustrate Kremlin-linked
information warfare operations against the
2018 mid-term elections. General Nakasone
stated that the reports ‘‘were very, very
helpful in terms of being able to understand
exactly what our adversary was trying to do
to build dissent within our nation.’’.
(11) Institutionalizing ongoing robust,
independent, and vigorous analysis of data
related to foreign threat networks within
and across social media platforms will help
counter ongoing information warfare oper-
ations against the United States, its allies,
and its partners.
(12) Archiving and disclosing to the public
the results of these analyses by the social
media companies and trusted third-party ex-
perts in a transparent manner will serve to
demonstrate that the social media compa-
nies are detecting and removing foreign ma-
lign activities from their platforms while
protecting the privacy of the people of the
United States and will build public under-
standing of the scale and scope of these for-
eign threats to our democracy, since expo-
sure is one of the most effective means to
build resilience.
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense
of the Senate that—
(1) the social media companies should co-
operate among themselves and with inde-
pendent organizations and researchers on a
sustained and regular basis to share and ana-
lyze data and indicators relevant to foreign
information warfare operations within and
across their platforms in order to detect and
counter foreign information warfare oper-
ations that threaten the national security of
the United States and its allies and partners;
(2) these analytic efforts should be orga-
nized in such a fashion as to meet the high-
est standards of ethics, confidentiality, and
privacy protection of the people of the
United States;
(3) these analytic efforts should be under-
taken as soon as possible to facilitate coun-
tering ongoing Kremlin, Kremlin-linked, and
other foreign information warfare operations
and to aid in preparations for the United
States presidential and congressional elec-
tions in 2020 and beyond;
(4) the structure and operations of social
media companies make them well positioned
to address foreign adversary threat networks
within and across their platforms, and these
efforts could be conducted without direct
Government involvement, direction, or regu-
lation; and
(5) if the social media industry fails to
take sufficient action to address foreign ad-
versary threat networks operating within or
across their platforms, Congress would have
to consider additional safeguards for ensur-
ing that this threat is effectively mitigated.
(c) AUTHORITY TO FACILITATE ESTABLISH-
MENT OF SOCIAL MEDIA DATA ANALYSIS CEN-
TER.—
(1) AUTHORITY.—The Director of National
Intelligence, in coordination with the Sec-

REMEMBERING ROBIN DALE
HOLBROOK
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President,
today I would like to remember the re-
markable life and lasting impact of
Robin Dale Holbrook, of Banner, KY,
who passed away last month in a tragic
accident. Robin, who was widely ad-
mired for his selfless compassion and
unshakable integrity, dedicated his life
to improving the health of his Floyd
County community for nearly three
decades.
Robin was the clinic director at the
Eula Hall Healthcare Center in Mud
Creek, where he made a difference in
the lives of so many. I have had the
privilege to visit this important center,
in this rural Appalachian community,
which provides comprehensive services
to many Kentuckians who may not
have access to other care. As both a
physician’s assistant and an adminis-
trator, Robin’s coworkers remembered
he didn’t approach his work as a job,
but rather a passion. Caring for the
members of his community was a call-
ing for Robin and a way to live out his
Christian ministry.
The staff at the Eula Hall center in-
tend to show respect for his memory by
delivering the same level of care Robin
gave to patients every single day.
On July 3, Robin’s family, friends,
and colleagues will celebrate his life at
the clinic where he served his commu-
nity. I would like to join them as they
honor this impressive man and his dec-
ades of kindness and service to Floyd
County. Elaine and I extend our condo-
lences to Robin’s wife, Angela, his fam-
ily, and his many friends.

wish to commemorate the 150th anni-
versary of the town of Grand Isle, ME.
As one who was born and raised in
Aroostook County, it is a great pleas-
ure to celebrate the generations of in-
dustrious and caring people who have
made Grand Isle such a wonderful place
to live, work, and raise families.
Named for a large and fertile island
in the St. John River, Grand Isle is a
small town with a rich history. For
thousands of years, the river valley has
been the home of the Micmac and
Maliseet. French explorers, led by
Samuel de Champlain, first visited the
area in 1604. In the late 1700s, French-
speaking Canadians began settling in
the area, laying the foundation for the
vibrant Acadian culture that is so im-
portant in Maine, New Brunswick,
Nova Scotia, and as far away as Lou-
isiana.
The Acadian settlers created a vi-
brant community. They cleared farm-
land, established lumber and grain
mills, railroad roundhouses, and thriv-
ing general stores. In the 1870s, as rail-
ways expanded in the region, the peo-
ple of Grand Isle joined with their Ca-
nadian neighbors on the opposite shore
of the St. John River to build a ferry
system that used an 800-foot cable sus-
pended above the river to connect the
products of their hard work to faraway
markets.
When the World Acadian Congress
convened in Aroostook County in 2014,
the descendants of those neighbors
again came together to build a replica
of that historic ferry. The Grand Isle
homecoming held during the Congress
celebrated the rich Acadian traditions
of great food, music, and dance, and of
close-knit families and lasting friend-
ships.
Those traditions are preserved and
honored at the Cultural Museum of
Mount Carmel and its remarkable col-
lection of Acadian artifacts. The mu-
seum is located in the former Our Lady
of Mount Carmel Catholic Church, one
of the few surviving 19th-century Aca-
dian churches in northern Maine. That
beautiful architectural gem was lov-
ingly restored by the people of the re-
gion and is listed on the National Reg-
istry of Historic Places.
The celebration of Grand Isle’s 150th
anniversary is not merely about the
passing of time; it is about human ac-
complishment. We celebrate the people
who pulled together, cared for one an-
other, and built a great community.
Thanks to those who came before,
Grand Isle, ME, has a wonderful his-
tory. Thanks to those there today, it
has a bright future.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RENO
RODEO
∑ Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President,
I come forward today to recognize the
100th anniversary of one of northern
Nevada’s most treasured traditions,
the Reno Rodeo. A celebration of West-
ern culture and daring, the rodeo has
grown into a Nevada institution that
draws visitors from across the country.
Over the past 100 years, Northern Ne-
vada has seen a constant state of
change and evolution. Yet, throughout
that time, the Reno Rodeo has been a
reliable and steady source of entertain-
ment and community.
In 1919, the Commercial Club of Reno
devised the first iteration of the Reno
Rodeo, then the Nevada Round-Up, in
order to celebrate the end of World War
I. Cowboys such as Hippy Burmister
and Curly Howe won events in the 1919
rodeo. The most notable winner of the
first Reno Rodeo was Jesse Stahl, one
of the first African-American profes-
sional bronc riders. Stahl was known
for his ability to ride bucking horses
while sitting backwards and ‘‘winning
first but placing third’’ due to the color
of his skin. Stahl went on to win four
events over the first 3 years of the
Reno Rodeo.
Despite only 6 weeks of event plan-
ning, the inaugural rodeo was a wildly
popular event, and there was imme-
diate interest in establishing the rodeo
as an annual celebration. Nearly 17,000
people attended the following year, and
the rodeo proved it was not a fleeting
success. In 1922, rodeo organizers plot-
ted a publicity strategy around sending
reigning rodeo queen, Mary Har-
rington, to invite President Warren G.
Harding to the event. President Har-
ding declined the invitation. To make
matters worse, the campaign led to the
organization’s bankruptcy and a 10-
year hiatus of the rodeo. In 1932,
Charles Sadleir, now frequently re-
ferred to as the Father of the Reno
Rodeo, led an effort to revive the
event. To stabilize the rodeo’s finances,
Sadleir recruited local businesses to
help underwrite the events’ expenses,
which is still a crucial mechanism
today.
Fortunately, Sadleir’s revitalization
efforts were successful, and the Reno
Rodeo has withstood economic
downturns, event growing pains, and a
fire to the venue. Today, the Reno
Rodeo is a Professional Rodeo Cowboys
Association-sanctioned competition,
billed as the ‘‘Wildest, Richest Rodeo
in the West!’’ Each year, the rodeo gen-
erates roughly $42 million for the re-
gion and draws over 14,000 fans.
Through its charitable foundation, the
rodeo has provided hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars in academic scholar-
ships to Nevada students and grants to
non-profit organizations. In 2008, the
foundation built a horseback riding fa-
cility for children with special, phys-
ical, or mental needs, and later built
an activities center for abused, ne-
glected, and at-risk children under the
care of Washoe County.
One hundred years after the first
event, Northern Nevada’s support and
appreciation for the Reno Rodeo has
never been stronger. Nevadans are im-
mensely proud of this homegrown tra-
dition and excited to see its evolution
over the next 100 years. Thank you to
everyone who has been involved with
the Reno Rodeo and allowed it to
thrive today.∑

TRIBUTE TO THE STUDENTS OF
GILFORD HIGH SCHOOL’S INTRO-
DUCTION TO ENGINEERING
CLASS
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am
proud to recognize the students of
Gilford High School’s introduction to
engineering class as June 2019 Granite
Staters of the Month. These students
successfully applied their engineering
knowledge to create personalized, easy-
to-use mobility devices for three young
students in their community who expe-
rience disabilities.
The idea for this project came from
Troy Gallagher, who just graduated
from Gilford High School and will at-
tend Texas Tech in the fall. Last sum-
mer, Troy participated in an advanced
studies program at St. Paul’s School,
where he took a 5-week engineering
course that introduced him to the Uni-
versity of Delaware program
GoBabyGo!, which works with commu-
nities around the world to modify ride-
on cars for children with disabilities.
The vehicles can be used in physical
and occupational therapy sessions, in
speech therapy as a means to increase
a child’s expressive and receptive lan-
guage skills, and to help the children
better socialize with their peers.
Troy thought this would be an excel-
lent engineering project to bring to
Gilford High School, as did his intro-
duction to engineering teacher, Dan
Caron. After petitioning the parent
teacher association, PTA, to provide
the class money to buy the necessary
parts and selecting the students that
would receive these vehicles, the stu-
dents in Gilford High School’s, intro-
duction to engineering class got to
work.
The GoBabyGo! project was the stu-
dents’ final engineering assignment,
and to successfully build these mobil-
ity devices, the students used every-
thing that they had learned about the
engineering design process.
First, the students visited with the
three children, preschoolers George and
Morgan, and first-grader Chloe, to take
their measurements and determine how
to best modify the Power Wheels to fit
the specific needs of the children. For
instance, the students noted that
Chloe’s left hand was weaker than her
right, so they knew that they would
need to move the button that acceler-
ates the vehicle to the left side of the
steering wheel, which allows her to ac-
celerate with her weaker hand while
steering with her dominant hand.
The students also modified the head-
rest using pool noodles and refitted the
hard plastic seats with softer materials
with a design from the popular chil-
dren’s show, ‘‘Paw Patrol.’’ Since some
of the children have difficulty using
their legs, the students rewired the
pedal functions to the steering wheel,
so that the children could easily start
and stop the device with their hands.
After the vehicles were completed,
Mr. Caron’s class visited the elemen-
tary school to present the children
with their new mobility devices. The
Gilford Police and Fire Department
helped by bringing the two vehicles
over to the school, which was fitting
since the mobility devices were de-
signed to look like a police car and a
fire truck. One of the students even
customized the vehicles with Gilford
Elementary School license plates in
the front and New Hampshire plates in
the back with the students’ names and
made Gilford Fire and Police logos for
the front grills of the trucks.
The students presented the devices to
two of the children in front of almost
the entire elementary school. Troy
gave a presentation about the project
to the school in the hopes of inspiring
more elementary school students to
get interested in the STEAM fields of
science, technology, engineering, art,
and mathematics.
I congratulate these students for
their ingenuity, hard work, and com-
passion. I thank them for dem-
onstrating that, by being inclusive, we
unleash the talent and energy of our
friends and peers, strengthen our com-
munities, and bring joy and dignity to
those who have been marginalized.∑

REMEMBERING BRIGADIER GEN-
ERAL ERNEST RANDOLPH WEB-
STER
∑ Mrs. HYDE-SMTIH. Mr. President, it
is an honor to pay tribute to Brig. Gen.
Ernest Randolph ‘‘Randy’’ Webster,
U.S. Air Force, retired, who passed
away on June 2, 2019. A native of Mid-
night, MS, he served our country with
distinction both stateside and abroad.
General Webster, who was an Army
ROTC student at Arkansas State Uni-
versity, joined the U.S. Marine Corps
and became a helicopter pilot and in-
telligence officer while serving in the
Vietnam War. Following his service in
Vietnam, General Webster transferred
to the Air Force Reserve, where he
served in a variety of assignments,
eventually rising to the rank of briga-
dier general.
General Webster’s final assignment
was as commander of the 403rd Wing at
Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, MS.
Also known as the Hurricane Hunters,
the airmen 53rd Weather Reconnais-
sance Squadron, a component of the
403rd Wing, have the critical mission of
flying into dangerous conditions to
identify and assess storms developing
in the Gulf of Mexico. The information
they provide is crucial to allowing
States and communities in the Gulf
Coast region to prepare for severe
storms.
Under General Webster’s leadership,
the Hurricane Hunter aviators, along
with support personnel, successfully
fulfilled this vital mission of pro-
tecting Gulf Coast communities from
weather-related disasters and further
solidified their role as a key national
asset.
General Webster stayed true to form
following his retirement in 2000 with 33
years of military service, dedicating
himself to his family and volunteering
his time to youth groups and his
church.
Our gratitude and condolences go out
to his wife Martha Webster and the en-
tire Webster family during this dif-
ficult time.∑

RECOGNIZING CHIPOLA COLLEGE
LADY INDIANS
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I recog-
nize the Chipola College Lady Indians
softball team, winners of the National
Junior College Athletic Association Di-
vision I National Championship.
The Lady Indians are comprised of
talented young women in Marianna,
FL and finished their season scoring a
total of 69 runs and a 52–5–1 record,
leading them to the team’s third over-
all NJCAA championship title.
In the national championship game,
they played against Angelina College
from Lufkin, TX, and trailed by two
runs after the first inning. Beginning
in the second inning, the Lady Indians
scored five runs, with Mikayla Lewin
and Haley Sandridge both hitting
homeruns. In the third inning, the
team scored five more runs on six hits
from Thais Uyeme, Sydney Mclain,
Candela Figueroa, and Haley
Sandridge, who all had RBIs in the in-
ning.
The Lady Indians led Angelina Col-
lege 10–2 entering the fourth inning.
The scored remained the same until
the sixth inning, when Eila Infante and
Mikayla Lewin scored two more runs
for the team. In the seventh and final
inning, the Lady Indians scored seven
more runs from Yoshi Omori, Tammie
Lijbers, Sandridge, Infante, Jadia
Jones, and Ally Clegg. At the bottom
of the seventh, Amy Woodham recorded
the first two outs against Angelina
College before Brianna Bailey entered
the game and recorded the final strike-
out of the championship game. Chipola
won with a final score of 19–2.
I extend my best wishes to head soft-
ball coach Belinda Hendrix, associate
head softball coach Jimmy Hendrix, as-
sistant softball coach Kelly Brookins,
Brianna Bailey, Tyra Brown, Payton
Clark, Ally Clegg, Candela Figeroa,
Lauren Finch, Eila Infante, Jadia

SPECT TO NORTH KOREA, RE-
CEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT
OF THE SENATE ON JUNE 21,

The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message
from the President of the United
States, together with an accompanying
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Banking, Housing, and
Urban Affairs:
To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90
days before the anniversary date of its
declaration, the President publishes in
the Federal Register and transmits to
the Congress a notice stating that the
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to
the Federal Register for publication the
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to North
Korea that was declared in Executive
Order 13466 of June 26, 2008, expanded in
scope in Executive Order 13551 of Au-
gust 30, 2010, addressed further in Exec-
utive Order 13570 of April 18, 2011, fur-
ther expanded in scope in Executive
Order 13687 of January 2, 2015, and
under which additional steps were
taken in Executive Order 13722 of
March 15, 2016, and Executive Order
13810 of September 20, 2017, is to con-
tinue in effect beyond June 26, 2019.
The existence and risk of prolifera-
tion of weapons-usable fissile material
on the Korean Peninsula; the actions
and policies of the Government of
North Korea that destabilize the Ko-
rean Peninsula and imperil United
States Armed Forces, allies, and trad-
ing partners in the region, including its
pursuit of nuclear and missile pro-
grams; and other provocative, desta-
bilizing, and repressive actions and
policies of the Government of North
Korea, continue to constitute an un-
usual and extraordinary threat to the
national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States. For this
reason, I have determined that it is
necessary to continue the national
emergency declared in Executive Order
13466 with respect to North Korea.

Revenue Code of 1986 to permit high de-

deductible; to the Committee on Fi-
nance.
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the text of the

There being no objection, the text of
the bill was ordered to be printed in
the RECORD, as follows:
S. 1948
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as
the ‘‘Chronic Disease Management Act of
2019’’.
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the fol-
lowing:
(1) A small number of chronic diseases ac-
count for the majority of health care spend-
ing in the United States.
(2) The Office of the Assistant Secretary
for Health of the Department of Health and
Human Services used a deliberative process

health to develop a list of 20 chronic condi-
tions that are prevalent and potentially
amenable to public health or clinical inter-
ventions, or a combination of both.
(3) Limited and targeted interventions for
many chronic diseases prevent the need for
additional, more costly therapies associated
with untreated or unmanaged chronic dis-
eases that lead to adverse effects on quality
of life for patients.
(4) These types of chronic care preventive
services should be encouraged to maximize
the effectiveness and positive outcomes of
the care provided under high deductible
health plans.
(5) Section 223(c)(2)(C) of the Internal Rev-
enue Code of 1986 explicitly grants the Sec-
retary of the Treasury flexibility in defining
the scope of preventive care for purposes of
the preventive care safe harbor. As of the
date of introduction of this Act, the Sec-
retary of the Treasury has refrained from ex-
ercising existing authority under such sec-
tion to expand the preventive care safe har-
bor to include chronic disease prevention.
(6) In the absence of an expansion of the
preventive care safe harbor by the Secretary
of the Treasury, the Chronic Disease Man-
agement Act of 2019 would expressly permit
high-deductible health plans to provide
chronic disease prevention and treatment,
subject to certain limitations, prior to a plan
enrollee having met their plan deductible.
(7) Allowing health savings account-eligi-
ble high-deductible health plans to cover
chronic disease prevention and treatment on
a pre-deductible basis promotes the concept
of Value-Based Insurance Design, which is an
effective tool to improve the quality and re-
duce the cost of care for Americans with
chronic diseases, with improved outcomes
via increased medication adherence, reduced
complications, and decreased emergency de-
partment visits.
SEC. 2. CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 223(c)(2) of the In-
ternal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by
redesignating subparagraph (D) as subpara-
graph (E) and by inserting after subpara-
graph (C) the following new subparagraph:
‘‘(D) SAFE HARBOR FOR ABSENCE OF DEDUCT-
IBLE FOR CARE RELATED TO CHRONIC CONDI-
TIONS.—A plan shall not fail to be treated as
a high deductible health plan by reason of
failing to have a deductible for care related
to the treatment of any chronic condition, as
determined by the Assistant Secretary for
Health of the Department of Health and
Human Services.’’.
(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendments
made by this section shall apply to coverage
for months beginning after the date of the
enactment of this Act.
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and
Ms. SMITH):
S. 1949. A bill to amend the Richard
B. Russell National School Lunch Act
to require the Secretary of Agriculture
to make loan guarantees and grants to
finance certain improvements to
school lunch facilities, to train school
food service personnel, and for other
purposes; to the Committee on Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am
pleased to join my colleague from Min-
nesota, Senator SMITH, in introducing
the School Food Modernization Act to
assist schools in updating outdated
kitchen equipment, allowing them to
provide healthier meals to students.
School meals play a vital role in the
lives of our young people. More than
95,000 schools participate in the Na-
tional School Lunch program, serving
upwards of 30 million children each
day. Many children consume up to half
their daily caloric intake at school,
and some get their most nutritious
meal of the day at school instead of at
home. Because school meals are a sig-
nificant source of daily nutrition for so
many, we must consistently aim to im-
prove the program to best serve stu-
dents.
Schools built decades ago often lack
the equipment and infrastructure nec-
essary to do more than reheat and
serve one or two meal options each
day. In 2014, it was estimated that
Maine schools alone would need $58.8
million for equipment infrastructure
upgrades needed to serve healthy meals
to all of our students. I am pleased
that the Agriculture Appropriations
Subcommittee has consistently recog-
nized this need, and in Fiscal Year 2019
appropriated $30 million for School
Equipment Assistance Grants. Through
this funding, Maine will be able to
competitively award $85,470 to school
districts in need of updated equipment.
Nutrition directors at Mount View
High School in Thorndike, Maine, used
USDA Equipment Assistance funding
to purchase a blast chiller to accom-
modate increased quantities of fruits
and vegetables. Thanks to this equip-
ment, the school is now able to quickly
and safely preserve the food’s freshness
while reducing spoilage. Other schools
have acquired hot holding cabinets,
mobile food carts, and even combina-
tion ovens, which prepare foods faster
and maintain more vitamin and nutri-
ent content compared with many other
cooking methods. Our legislation
would codify and improve this success-
ful grant program to better meet the
growing need nationwide.
The School Food Modernization Act
seeks to help school food service per-
sonnel offer a wide variety of nutri-
tious and appealing meals to all stu-
dents. First, the bill would provide tar-
geted grant assistance to supply the
seed funding needed to upgrade kitchen
infrastructure or to purchase high-
quality equipment. Second, it would es-
tablish a loan guarantee assistance
program within USDA to help schools
acquire new equipment. Finally, to aid
school food services personnel in run-
ning successful, healthy programs, the
legislation would authorize USDA to
provide support on a competitive basis
to highly qualified third-party trainers
to develop and administer training and
technical assistance, including online
programs.
I appreciate that some provisions of
this legislation were incorporated into
previous versions of the Children Nu-
trition Reauthorization legislation ap-
proved by the Senate Agriculture Com-
mittee. I encourage our colleagues to
continue to support school kitchen
equipment needs as the reauthorization
process continues.
Mr. President, if our school children

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS
SENATE RESOLUTION 259—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE
SENATE THAT UNITED STATES
LEADERSHIP IN 5G WIRELESS
TECHNOLOGY IS A NATIONAL
PRIORITY
Mr. JOHNSON submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred
to the Committee on Commerce,
Science, and Transportation:
S. RES. 259
Whereas the United States led the world in
the development and deployment of fourth-
generation (commonly known as ‘‘4G’’) wire-
less technology, such as Long Term Evo-
lution (commonly known as ‘‘LTE’’);
Whereas United States leadership in 4G
technology created a mobile broadband econ-
omy that generated hundreds of thousands of
jobs, billions of dollars of investment and
economic growth, and tremendous consumer
benefits;
Whereas the fifth generation of wireless
connectivity, known as ‘‘5G’’, promises to be
even more transformative, with speeds 100
times faster than 4G and even greater capac-
ity to carry wireless traffic than 4G;
Whereas the benefits of 5G technology to
the people of the United States will be sub-
stantial, including better access to high-
quality health care through telemedicine,
better and cheaper food production through
precision agriculture, more efficient manu-
facturing and transportation systems, more
advanced educational opportunities, more
avenues for entrepreneurship, more sophisti-
cated and secure military applications and
devices, and other benefits that cannot yet
be conceived;
Whereas the Federal Communications
Commission has introduced a comprehensive
strategy to promote United States leader-
ship in 5G technology, entitled ‘‘Facilitating
America’s Superiority in 5G Technology’’ (or
the ‘‘5G FAST Plan’’);
Whereas a core component of the 5G FAST
Plan for the development and deployment of
5G technology in the United States is mak-
ing substantially more spectrum available,
including low-band, mid-band, and high-band
airwaves;
Whereas the Federal Communications
Commission is vested with authority to
make spectrum available for the commercial
marketplace; and
Whereas the failure of the United States
Government to present a unified position on
the appropriate policies for critical 5G spec-
trum bands, including the 24 gigahertz band,
at the World Radiocommunication Con-
ference 2019 (commonly referred to as ‘‘WRC-
19’’) and to persuade allies to support that
position could lead to a decision that would
make those bands unusable for purposes of
5G technology development, impeding
United States leadership and empowering
global rivals: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) deems it a national priority for the
United States to lead the world in the devel-
opment and deployment of fifth-generation
(commonly known as ‘‘5G’’) wireless tech-
nology;
(2) supports the efforts of the Federal Com-
munications Commission to make spectrum
available for the commercial marketplace;
and
(3) strongly urges all entities, including
Federal agencies, to work cooperatively with

KING, Mr. JONES, Mr. MERKLEY, and Ms.
KLOBUCHAR) submitted the following
resolution; which was referred to the
Committee on Foreign Relations:
S. RES. 260
Whereas, of all children under 5 years of
age worldwide—
(1) 149,000,000, or 21.9 percent, are stunted
or chronically undernourished;
(2) an estimated 7.3 percent, or nearly
49,000,000, experience life-threatening acute
malnutrition (also known as ‘‘wasting’’); and
(3) more than 40,000,000 are overweight;
Whereas, in countries highly affected by
undernutrition, stunting affects 1 in every 3
children;
Whereas malnutrition directly or indi-
rectly causes 45 percent of all deaths of chil-
dren under 5 years of age, a total of 2,600,000
deaths annually;
Whereas children who experience malnutri-
tion—
(1) may experience impaired brain develop-
ment, lower IQ, and weakened immune sys-
tems; and
(2) are at a greater risk of contracting seri-
ous diseases;
Whereas undernourished adolescent girls
have impaired cognitive ability and produc-
tivity, and the future children of those girls
are at increased risk for low birth weight
and death;
Whereas iron deficiency anemia, associated
with undernutrition, contributes to 1 in 5
maternal deaths, or 20 percent of maternal
mortality;
Whereas poor maternal nutrition contrib-
utes to poor fetal development and low birth
weight, and an estimated 60 to 80 percent of
neonatal deaths occur in low-birth-weight
babies;
Whereas a large body of scientific evidence
supports the benefits of improved
breastfeeding practices on the short-term
and long-term health and development of
children and their mothers;
Whereas a growing body of evidence indi-
cates that reducing maternal and child mal-
nutrition, especially in the critical 1,000-day
period between the beginning of pregnancy
and the second birthday of the child, is im-
perative to—
(1) ending preventable child and maternal
deaths;
(2) improving cognitive and physical devel-
opment; and
(3) strengthening the immune systems of
children to bolster resistance to disease;
Whereas leading economists and Nobel
Laureates have identified improving child
nutrition as the most cost-effective way to
improve global health outcomes and enhance
development;
Whereas the approach of the Multi-Sec-
toral Nutrition Strategy of the United
States Agency for International Develop-
ment addresses the direct and underlying
causes of malnutrition;
Whereas the focus of the Multi-Sectoral
Nutrition Strategy on linking humanitarian
assistance with development programming
helps build resilience to shocks in vulnerable
communities;
Whereas malnutrition is a universal issue
that no country can afford to overlook;
Whereas countries with populations that
experience high burdens of malnutrition, in-
cluding stunting, wasting, anemia, and
micronutrient deficiency, will struggle to
achieve sustainable and equitable economic
growth;
Whereas the United States plays a leading
role supporting the goals of Scaling Up Nu-
trition, a global movement of 60 countries to
prioritize nutrition through effective policy
and dedicated national resources, particu-
larly during the 1,000-day window of oppor-
tunity between the beginning of pregnancy
and the second birthday of the child; and
Whereas, although the world has reduced
undernutrition since 1990, global progress
has been too slow—
(1) to ensure that each child can attain a
full and prosperous future regardless of
where that child was born; and
(2) for the global community to reach the
global nutrition targets set for 2025: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) recognizes that—
(A) food security and good nutrition in
early childhood saves lives and lays the foun-
dation for healthy physical and cognitive
growth and development;
(B) the potential benefits of good nutrition
in early childhood are life-long and influence
the entire future of the child, with entire
communities and nations ultimately pros-
pering;
(C) the right nutrition—
(i) helps children learn;
(ii) helps protect children from illness;
(iii) increases the productivity and earning
potential of children later in life; and
(iv) supports the well-being and health of
the future offspring of those children who re-
ceive that nutrition;
(D) women who are well-nourished and do
not suffer from anemia are less likely to die
in childbirth or give birth to children who
are malnourished, breaking the intergenera-
tional cycle of malnutrition;
(E) good nutrition is an economic issue
that is central to reducing poverty and put-
ting countries on a path to economic devel-
opment;
(F) adults who were well-nourished as chil-
dren earn up to 46 percent more than adults
who were malnourished as children;
(G) countries with a very high burden of
early childhood malnutrition have lower eco-
nomic growth rates due to lost income and
productivity; and
(H) the cost of childhood malnutrition to
countries is substantial, with—
(i) estimated losses in Gross Domestic
Product of 3 to 16 percent; and
(ii) potential impacts to the global econ-
omy as high as $3,500,000,000,000 per year;
(2) applauds the leadership of the United
States in helping developing countries meet
the nutritional needs of women and children;
(3) supports continued efforts by the
United States to help developing countries
meet the nutritional needs of women and
children;
(4) commends the United States Agency for
International Development (referred to in
this resolution as ‘‘USAID’’) for recognizing
that nutrition interventions are among the
highest-impact evidence-based interventions
that—
(A) are lifesaving; and
(B) support the goal of ending preventable
child and maternal deaths;
(5) recognizes the Multi-Sectoral Nutrition
Strategy, the U.S. Government Global Nutri-
tion Coordination Plan, and the Global Food
Security Strategy as platforms through
which to reach, by 2025, the global nutrition
targets agreed to at the World Health As-
sembly in 2012;
(6) recognizes the vision and goals of the
Scaling Up Nutrition movement, a global
partnership supporting country-led efforts to
improve maternal and child nutrition
through the involvement of—
(A) governments;
(B) civil society;
(C) the United Nations;
(D) donors;
(E) businesses; and
(F) researchers;
(7) recognizes that progress against global
malnutrition must be accelerated using in-
novative, scaled up approaches to improve
the systems that affect the health and nutri-
tional status of women and children; and
(8) calls for transformative efforts across
sectors at USAID to accelerate progress to
end maternal and child malnutrition, includ-
ing through—
(A) country development cooperation
strategies that align with national nutrition
plans; and
(B) improved and clear methods to track
nutrition funding and outcomes across all
global nutrition programs of the United
States Government, especially those relating
to—
(i) global health;
(ii) food security;
(iii) agriculture;
(iv) basic education;
(v) food assistance; and
(vi) water, sanitation, and hygiene (also
known as ‘‘WASH’’).

and cultivated musical traditions, brought
musical instruments with them, and built
new musical instruments in the United
States;
Whereas spirituals were a distinct response
to the conditions of African slavery in the
United States, and expressed the longing of
enslaved people for spiritual and bodily free-
dom, for safety from harm and evil, and for
relief from the hardships of slavery;
Whereas jazz, arguably the most creative
and complex music that the United States
has produced, combines the musical tradi-
tions of African Americans in New Orleans
with the creative flexibility of blues music;
Whereas masterful trumpeters Louis Arm-
strong and Miles Davis achieved national
and international recognition with the suc-
cess of ‘‘West End Blues’’ by Louis Arm-
strong in the 1920s and ‘‘So What’’ by Miles
Davis in the late 1950s;
Whereas talented jazz pianist and vocalist
Nathaniel Adams Coles recorded more than
150 singles and sold more than 50 million
records;
Whereas the talent of Ella Fitzgerald, win-
ner of 13 Grammys, is epitomized by a ren-
dition of ‘‘Summertime’’, a bluesy record ac-
companied by melodic vocals;
Whereas Natalie Cole, the daughter of Na-
thaniel Adams Coles, achieved musical suc-
cess in the mid-1970s as a rhythm and blues
artist with the hits ‘‘This Will Be’’ and ‘‘Un-
forgettable’’;
Whereas in the 1940s, bebop evolved
through jam sessions, which included trum-
peter Dizzy Gillespie and the alto saxo-
phonist Charlie Parker, that were held at
clubs in Harlem, New York, such as Minton’s
Playhouse;
Whereas earlier classical singers such as
Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield, one of the first
widely known African-American vocalists,
and other early African-American singing
pioneers, including Nellie Mitchell Brown,
Marie Selika Williams, Rachel Walker Tur-
ner, Marian Anderson, and Flora Batson Ber-
gen, paved the way for female African-Amer-
ican concert singers who have achieved great
popularity during the last 50 years;
Whereas the term ‘‘rhythm and blues’’
originated in the late 1940s as a way to de-
scribe recordings marketed to African Amer-
icans and replaced the term ‘‘race music’’;
Whereas lyrical themes in rhythm and
blues often encapsulate the African-Amer-
ican experience of pain, the quest for free-
dom, joy, triumphs and failures, relation-
ships, economics, and aspiration, and were
popularized by artists such as Ray Charles,
Ruth Brown, Etta James, and Otis Redding;
Whereas soul music originated in the Afri-
can-American community in the late 1950s
and early 1960s and combines elements of Af-
rican-American gospel music, rhythm and
blues, and jazz, and was popularized by art-
ists such as Aretha Franklin, James Brown,
Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, and Jackie Wilson;
Whereas Motown, founded as a record label
in 1959, evolved into a distinctive style
known for the ‘‘Motown Sound’’, a blend of
pop and soul musical stylings made popular
by prominent Black artists such as Marvin
Gaye, James Mason, and Mary Wells;
Whereas in the early 1970s, the musical
style of disco emerged and was popularized
by programs such as Soul Train and by art-
ists such as Donna Summer;
Whereas reggae is a genre of music that
originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s and
incorporates some of the musical elements of
rhythm and blues, jazz, mento, calypso, and
African music, and was popularized by art-
ists such as Bob Marley;
Whereas rock and roll was developed from
African-American musical styles such as
gospel and rhythm and blues, and was popu-
larized by artists such as Chuck Berry, Bo
Diddley, and Jimi Hendrix;
Whereas rap, arguably the most complex
and influential form of hip-hop culture, com-
bines elements of the African-American mu-
sical tradition (blues, jazz, and soul) with
Caribbean calypso, dub, and dance hall
reggae;
Whereas the development and popularity of
old style rap combined confident beats with
wordplay and storytelling, highlighting the
struggle of African-American youth growing
up in underresourced neighborhoods;
Whereas contemporary rhythm and blues,
which originated in the late 1970s and com-
bines elements of pop, rhythm and blues,
soul, funk, hip hop, gospel, and electronic
dance music was popularized by artists such
as Whitney Houston and Aaliyah;
Whereas Prince Rogers Nelson, who was
known for electric performances and wide
vocal range, pioneered music that integrated
a wide variety of styles, including funk,
rock, contemporary rhythm and blues, new
wave, soul, psychedelia, and pop;
Whereas a recent study by the Department
of Education found that only 28 percent of
African-American students receive any kind
of arts education;
Whereas African-American students scored
the lowest of all ethnicities in the most re-
cent National Assessment for Educational
Progress arts assessment;
Whereas students who are eligible for the
school lunch program established under the
Richard B. Russell National School Lunch
Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) have significantly
lower scores on the music portion of the Na-
tional Assessment for Educational Progress
arts assessment than students that are ineli-
gible for that program, which suggests that
students in low-income families are dis-
advantaged in the subject of music;
Whereas a recent study showed that nearly
2⁄3 of music ensemble students were White
and middle class and only 15 percent were Af-
rican-American;
Whereas the same study found that only 7
percent of music teacher licensure can-
didates were African-American; and
Whereas students of color face many bar-
riers to accessing music education and train-
ing, especially students in large urban public
schools: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate recognizes—
(1) the contributions of African Americans
to the musical heritage of the United States;
(2) the wide array of talented and popular
African-American musical artists, com-
posers, songwriters, and musicians who are
underrecognized for contributions to music;
(3) the achievements, talent, and hard
work of African-American pioneer artists,
and the obstacles that those artists over-
came to gain recognition;
(4) the need for African-American students
to have greater access to and participation
in music education in schools across the
United States; and
(5) Black History Month and African-
American Music Appreciation Month as an
important time—
(A) to celebrate the impact of the African-
American musical heritage on the musical
heritage of the United States; and
(B) to encourage greater access to music
education so that the next generation may
continue to greatly contribute to the musi-
cal heritage of the United States.

S. RES. 262
Whereas in 1972, President Richard M.
Nixon signed into law title IX of the Edu-
cation Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et
seq.) (referred to in this preamble as ‘‘title
IX’’);
Whereas in 2002, Congress passed a joint
resolution establishing that title IX may be
cited as the ‘‘Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal
Opportunity in Education Act’’;
Whereas title IX prohibits any institution
that receives Federal education funding from
discriminating against students or employ-
ees on the basis of sex;
Whereas sex discrimination includes—
(1) gender-based violence;
(2) sexual harassment and assault;
(3) dating violence; and
(4) domestic violence;
Whereas title IX guarantees—
(1) equal educational opportunities for all
students, including pregnant or parenting
students and gender non-conforming stu-
dents; and
(2) protection for students from discrimi-
nation on the basis of actual or perceived
sexual orientation or gender identity;
Whereas since 1972, the United States has
made great progress in providing educational
opportunities to women and girls and, in
2017, women earned the majority of doctoral,
master’s, and associate degrees;
Whereas in the 2016–2017 academic year,
women earned approximately 57 percent of
the bachelor’s degrees awarded by institu-
tions of higher education in the United
States for the 18th consecutive year;
Whereas since 1972, the participation of
women and girls in sports has increased by
1,000 percent in high school and greater than
500 percent in college, providing women and
girls with the opportunity—
(1) to develop leadership and teamwork
skills;
(2) to earn athletic scholarships to help fi-
nance a college degree; and
(3) to become successful professional ath-
letes;
Whereas, despite the progress that has
been made in higher education and athletics,
women, girls, pregnant or parenting stu-
dents, and transgender and gender non-con-
forming students in the United States are
still frequently denied equal educational op-
portunities;

Whereas pregnant and parenting students
are more likely to drop out of high school
compared to other students, and only 51 per-
cent of teenage mothers earn a high school
diploma by the age of 22, leading to de-
creased opportunities for continuing edu-
cation and employment;
Whereas the number of baccalaureate de-
grees in science, technology, engineering,
and math earned by women has decreased
over the past decade and, as of the 2016–2017
academic year, women earn only—
(1) 38 percent of physical science degrees;
(2) 19 percent of computing degrees;
(3) 20 percent of engineering degrees; and
(4) 42 percent of mathematics degrees;
Whereas, despite representing 56 percent of
all students enrolled in colleges and univer-
sities in the United States, women hold al-
most 2⁄3 of all outstanding student debt
($900,000,000,000 of the total $1,400,000,000,000),
and the average amount of student debt
owed by a woman following the completion
of a baccalaureate degree is $2,700 more than
the average amount of student debt owed by
a man;
Whereas, despite constituting 50 percent of
law school graduates over the past 20 years,
women constitute only 22.7 percent of part-
ners at major law firms;
Whereas, while women represent 75 percent
of the healthcare workforce, only 12 percent
of the chief executive officers of hospitals
are women;
Whereas 44 percent of all National Colle-
giate Athletic Association Division I, Divi-
sion II, and Division III student athletes are
women, but only 11 percent of the athletic
directors in Division I sports are women;
Whereas men still hold the vast majority
of leadership positions, while women make
up approximately—
(1) 4.8 percent of the chief executive offi-
cers of companies included in the S&P 500;
(2) 18 percent of Governors;
(3) 27.6 percent of executive officers elected
in statewide elections; and
(4) 30 percent of college and university
presidents;
Whereas, when data is disaggregated,
women of color have lower rates of—
(1) leadership positions; and
(2) science, technology, engineering, and
math degrees;
Whereas women continue to experience
sexual harassment and assault—
(1) as minors;
(2) at colleges and universities; and
(3) in the workplace;
Whereas 1 in 4 girls will experience some
form of sexual abuse before turning 18 years
old, with—
(1) 8 percent of high school students experi-
encing physical dating violence; and
(2) 7 percent of high school students experi-
encing sexual assault by a dating partner;
Whereas experiencing sexual abuse can—
(1) lead to symptoms of depression and
anxiety; and
(2) negatively impact academic achieve-
ment;
Whereas multiple studies have confirmed
that—
(1) 1 in 5 women and 1 in 4 transgender or
gender non-conforming students are sexually
assaulted on college campuses; and
(2) approximately 20 percent of girls have
been the victims of sexual assault or at-
tempted sexual assault while in high school;
Whereas students face pervasive discrimi-
nation and harassment on the basis of sexual
orientation and gender identity in school, on
college campuses, and in the workplace,
which—
(1) impedes the ability of the students to
fully access the educational opportunities to
which the students are entitled; and
(2) constitutes sex discrimination;
Whereas, because of the recent national
focus on sexual harassment and assault, re-
porting to the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission (referred to in this pre-
amble as the ‘‘EEOC’’) has increased 12 per-
cent from 2017 to 2018, reflecting more accu-
rate data on the prevalence of harassment
and resulting in a 50 percent increase in law-
suits filed by the EEOC in 2018;
Whereas the rule proposed by the Depart-
ment of Education regarding title IX would
substantially narrow campus protections and
would irresponsibly reverse much of the
progress made to combat sexual assaults on
educational campuses; and
Whereas, between 2011 and 2016, investiga-
tions by the Office for Civil Rights at the De-
partment of Education into reports of sexual
and dating violence and discrimination
against transgender students have helped to
identify and respond to systemic issues of
discrimination against students that other-
wise would have gone unrecognized, yet re-
cent actions from the Office for Civil Rights
indicate that there will be fewer resources
and less attention focused on issues of sexual
and dating violence and discrimination
against transgender students moving for-
ward: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) applauds the tremendous increase in
educational opportunities for women and
girls, including in sports, since the passage
of title IX of the Education Amendments of
1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.);
(2) encourages the Department of Edu-
cation and the Department of Justice to pro-
tect the rights of students to have safe learn-
ing environments by working to ensure
schools prevent and respond to discrimina-
tion and harassment on the basis of sex, in-
cluding—
(A) sexual assault;
(B) harassment;
(C) domestic and dating violence;
(D) discrimination or harassment on the
basis of pregnancy;
(E) sex stereotyping; and
(F) discrimination or harassment on the
basis of actual or perceived sexual orienta-
tion and gender identity; and
(3) recognizes the work that still remains
to be done to secure the promise of title IX
of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20
U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) that no federally funded
educational institution shall discriminate
against any person on the basis of sex.

lowing findings:
(1) The Battle of the Bulge was one of the
largest land battles fought by the United
States during World War II, yielded more
than 75,000 American casualties over the
winter of 1944–1945, and stopped the last
major German offensive on the Western
Front.
(2) The Battle of the Bulge is a legendary
battle in the history of the United States
Army.
(3) Following the war, Belgian groups
raised funds to construct the Mardasson Me-
morial in Bastogne, Belgium, to honor Amer-
icans killed, wounded, and missing in action
during the Battle of the Bulge.
(4) The Mardasson Memorial, inaugurated
in 1950, is a five-pointed American star with
the history of the battle, the names of the
units that fought, and the names of the
States engraved in gold letters throughout.
(5) The Mardasson Memorial, owned and
maintained by the Government of Belgium,
is in need of extensive repair to restore it to
a condition commensurate to the service and
sacrifice it honors.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress to support an agreement between
the American Battle Monument Commission
(hereinafter referred to as ‘‘ABMC’’) and the
Government of Belgium—
(1) under the monument maintenance pro-
gram of the ABMC, and subject to the re-
quirements of such program, by which the
ABMC would use its expertise and presence
in Europe to oversee restoration of the
Mardasson Memorial in preparation for the
75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge;
and
(2) under the monument trust fund pro-
gram of the ABMC, and subject to the re-

SEC. lll. WORLD LANGUAGE ADVANCEMENT
AND READINESS.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the fol-
lowing:
(1) The national security of the United
States continues to depend on language read-
iness, in particular among the 17 agencies of
the intelligence community.
(2) The levels of language proficiency re-
quired for national security necessitate long
sequences of language training for personnel
in the intelligence community and the De-
partment of Defense.
(3) The future national security and eco-
nomic well-being of the United States will
depend substantially on the ability of its
citizens to communicate and compete by
knowing the languages and cultures of other
countries.
(4) The Federal Government has an inter-
est in ensuring that the employees of its de-
partments and agencies with national secu-
rity responsibilities are prepared to meet the
challenges of this changing international en-
vironment.
(5) The Federal Government also has an in-
terest in taking actions to alleviate the
problem of American students being inad-
equately prepared to meet the challenges
posed by increasing global interaction
among nations.
(6) American elementary schools, sec-
ondary schools, colleges, and universities
must place a new emphasis on improving the
teaching of world languages, area studies,
counterproliferation studies, and other inter-
national fields to help meet those chal-
lenges.

(7) The United States needs more people to
speak languages other than English in order
to provide social and legal services for a
changing population.
(8) The study of a second language has been
linked to improved learning outcomes in
other subjects, enhanced cognitive ability,
and the development of empathy and effec-
tive interpretive skills. The use of a second
language has been linked to a delay in cer-
tain manifestations of aging.
(9) The United States lags behind most na-
tions of the world, including European na-
tions and China, in the percentage of its citi-
zens who have some knowledge of a second
language.
(10) According to the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences Commission on Language
Learning, Native American languages are
distinct in political status and history and
should therefore receive targeted support to
ensure their retention in alignment with the
Native American Languages Act (25 U.S.C.
2901 et seq.).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

amendments, I hope we can have an
open amendment process.
I know I speak on behalf of myself
and Senator REED. We have been want-
ing to do this for a long period of time.
While we are debating this bill, I en-
courage my colleagues to come to the
floor and share why the NDAA is im-
portant to their States and to national
security.
Here is one reason why. We are at a
really crucial junction in our military.
Our world keeps growing more unstable
and less safe. Our military is, frankly,
in a crisis. I think we are all aware of
that. The NDAA is going to set the
tone for our defense strategy not just
this year but well into the future.
It is a message to our servicemem-
bers, their families, and the world. Are
we going to show Russia and China
that we mean business? Are we going
to help our military continue to re-
build? Are we going to give our All-
Volunteer Force the equipment, train-
ing, and housing they need to do their
job? That is why this bill provides a
total of $750 billion in defense spending.
It is what we call the defense top line.
It is the minimum we need to restore
the longstanding military’s strength
that we have seemingly lost.
That is why this bill provides for it,
and that is why the bottom line and
the top line is the same thing. We have
real growth in the defense budget each
year. We have decided on this, tech-
nically, based on two sources, from the
military before our committees and
then, of course, the Commission report
that says that in order to get our mili-
tary back, we are going to have to have
a net increase of 3 to 5 percent, and
that is what this $750 billion will do.
This is also a direct recommendation
from our military leadership; that $750
billion is the bare minimum we need to
get to that goal. The committee has
heard the same refrain from every serv-
ice leader at posture hearings this
year; that stable, ontime, adequate
funding is their No. 1 priority.
So the best thing we can do for our
troops, it seems pretty clear to me, is
that this should be our priority too. An
important part of the whole equation is
that we are spending this money re-
sponsibly. This is an across-the-board
increase. The NDAA makes tough deci-
sions to put funding where it was most
needed and makes cuts in other places.
We direct this funding to critical, bi-
partisan priorities: a pay increase for
our troops, the largest in a decade; re-
building a right-sized force with the
newest, most capable aircraft, ships,
and equipment in the world; and mod-
ernizing our nuclear arsenal so it is
strong and safe.
During the last 5 years of the Obama
administration, the amount of money
we had to run our military was reduced
by almost 25 percent. That was ex-
tremely harmful to our readiness and
to our troop morale.
Thanks to the Trump administra-
tion, that trajectory is changing. In
fiscal year 2018, we increased funding
back up to $700 billion, the largest
year-over-year increase since the be-
ginning of the War on Terror.
In fiscal year 2019, we increased it
again to $716 billion and got that fund-
ing out the door on time. This was
really meaningful for our military, and
I hope we can do it again this year.
I commend Majority Leader MCCON-
NELL and my colleagues who are still
fighting for a budget deal. We have to
raise the defense cap or exempt defense
from the caps to give the military what
they need to fight and win. We are on
a path to recovery in our readiness
rates. We are helping the military keep
up with China and Russia. It is a dif-
ferent situation than we have ever been
in before. We have severe competitors
out there.
Let me conclude that we are on our
way right now. This is a major step. I
want to also say, in working with Sen-
ator REED, we have been together much
more than we have been apart. We have
been staying on top of this thing, and
our combined tenacity has resulted in
getting a bill done.
With that, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island.
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I commend
the chairman for the bipartisan and
thoughtful way he has approached this
entire process of crafting the National
Defense Authorization Act for this
year. We had a very successful markup.
The result was a strong bipartisan vote
of 25 to 2 on the committee. Subse-
quently, with our staff, we have done
an extraordinary job. We have been
able to include an additional 100
amendments, on a bipartisan basis, to
the substitute. So we have been able, I
think, to respond to all of the concerns
of our colleagues or very many of these
concerns of our colleagues.
The chairman has indicated some of
the strengths of the bill. We have in-
creased our operations and mainte-
nance funding so our readiness stature
and posture is increasing. One area,
too, that I think is very important is
the fundamental reform of privatized
housing which was a real problem that
we discovered. Again, the chairman led
two very thorough hearings in which
we had not only the operators but also
the families who live there. The legis-
lation before us contains significant
improvements in the privatized family
housing at the Department of Defense.
That is something critically impor-
tant.
I, too, like the chairman, would like
to see a very open amendment process
so we can bring to the floor amend-
ments that are important and linked to
the national defense bill, have votes on
these amendments, and then move for-
ward.
Let me just conclude my brief re-
marks by thanking the chairman for
his leadership.
I yield the floor.

egon.
DEATH OF JAMAL KHASHOGGI
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, tonight I
am going to speak about Saudi Ara-
bia’s brutal murder of U.S. resident
and journalist Jamal Khashoggi. This
despicable act has been condemned by
the Congress, by the American people,
and by governments and citizens
around the world, but Donald Trump
and members of his administration will
not talk about it. They seem to think
it is just fine to sweep this atrocity
under the rug. I am here to describe
why the Congress must not let that
happen and how I intend to do every-
thing in my power to make sure it does
not happen.
The Senate is now debating the De-
fense Authorization Act, which this
year includes the Intelligence Author-
ization Act. I serve on the Senate Se-
lect Committee on Intelligence, and
the Intelligence bill that is part of the
defense legislation contains an amend-
ment I offered with my colleagues,
Senator HEINRICH, Senator HARRIS,
Senator FEINSTEIN, and Senator BEN-
NET. That amendment requires that the
Director of National Intelligence pro-
vide a public report identifying those
who carried out, participated in, or-
dered, or were otherwise responsible for
the killing of Mr. Khashoggi.
Last Wednesday, the United Nations
released a detailed report on the
Khashoggi murder. The report de-
scribed how even before Mr. Khashoggi
entered the Saudi consulate in
Istanbul, Saudi officials had meticu-
lously planned his killing.
A team of more than a dozen Saudi
agents were organized. Their travel and
accommodations were designed to
mask the purpose of their trip to Tur-
key. The consulate office where the
killing took place was cleared of staff.
In the moments before Mr. Khashoggi’s
arrival at the consulate, the Saudi
agents were recorded discussing how to
kill and dismember him and dispose of
his body.
They referred to Mr. Khashoggi as
‘‘the sacrificial animal.’’ The report
even describes the recorded sounds of
the killing and the dismemberment.
Who bears ultimate responsibility for
this brutal, horrendous, despicable
crime? The U.N. report stated that
every expert—every expert—who was
consulted found it inconceivable that
an operation of this scale could be im-
plemented without the Crown Prince.
They found that, at the very least,
being aware that some kind of criminal
act was to be conducted against Mr.
Khashoggi was, in their view, clearly,
something the Crown Prince knew
about.
The U.N. then concluded that there
was ‘‘credible evidence warranting fur-
ther investigation of high-level Saudi
officials’ individual liability, including
the Crown Prince.’’ I have read that di-
rectly from the U.N. report.
The Senate has also spoken on this in
a resolution passed unanimously. The
Senate stated that it believes the
Crown Prince is responsible for the
murder of Jamal Khashoggi.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4471
June 24, 2019
Donald Trump and his administra-
tion refuse to discuss this publicly.
Last November, Donald Trump said the
intelligence community was con-
tinuing to assess information about the
killing, but as for the question of
whether the Crown Prince had knowl-
edge, the President said only: ‘‘Maybe
he did and maybe he didn’t.’’ Then he
said: ‘‘We may never know all the
facts.’’
So we have, in the Intelligence Com-
mittee, something at the beginning of
the year called an open threats hear-
ing. It is a public hearing. At that open
threats hearing, I asked the CIA Direc-
tor whether the Senate’s unanimous
belief that the Crown Prince was re-
sponsible was correct. She acknowl-
edged that the Khashoggi murder was
premeditated. In terms of who was re-
sponsible, she referred us to what the
Saudis had said publicly, but Director
Haspel said she would not disclose to
the public what the intelligence com-
munity thought with respect to who
was involved in the brutal murder of
Mr. Khashoggi. That is why there is a
provision in the Intelligence Author-
ization Act that we are considering, as
a part of this Defense bill, requiring a
public report on the Khashoggi killing.
The provision is there so, finally, more
than 8 months after the murder, there
will finally be some real account-
ability.
Now, those who may be following
these remarks or this discussion may
ask: Why does this matter? Why is this
important? It matters because the
Trump administration has bent over
backward to please the dictator run-
ning Saudi Arabia.
The U.N. report recommended an FBI
investigation of the Khashoggi murder.
Donald Trump made it clear that he is
not interested in that either. It is part
of a pattern. In one of the most dismal
and disappointing responses I have seen
to any national security concern, this
administration refuses to look into
whether Saudi officials helped Saudi
criminal suspects flee the United
States to escape justice.
The administration continues to turn
a blind eye to the Saudi Government’s
grotesque human rights abuses. Donald
Trump vetoed bipartisan legislation
that would have ended U.S. support for
a devastating and seemingly endless
war in Yemen. The President recently
invoked what I consider to be a phony
emergency to go around Congress and
sell arms to the Saudis. Example after
example, whether it is within our bor-
ders, in a consulate office in Istanbul,
or elsewhere, this administration’s
record is the same. They will help
cover up the Saudi Government’s bru-
tality.
Jamal Khashoggi, besides being a
U.S. resident, was a journalist who
wrote for a U.S. newspaper. The ab-
sence of accountability for his murder
sends a horrendous message that as far
as the Trump administration is con-
cerned, it is open season on journalists.
Donald Trump is making this clear
when he cozies up to dictators cracking
down on journalists in Russia, Hun-
gary, and the Philippines. That doesn’t
even include his affection for the dic-
tator of North Korea, where we all
know there is no press at all.
Donald Trump’s contempt for a free
press in the United States is as appar-
ent as it is dangerous. The White House
and Pentagon have simply stopped all
press briefings. Donald Trump has
threatened to use the taxation and
antitrust powers of the government to
punish the media when they dare to
criticize him. At his rallies, he has
whipped up support against the media
to the point where people are threat-
ening journalists in attendance. Al-
most every day, he dismisses any
media outlet that accurately describes
what he disagrees with, with respect to
their comments, the corruption in his
administration, as fake news. Re-
cently, he accused journalists at the
New York Times of treason after they
dared to publish a story that displeased
him.
The Trump administration created a
secret list of journalists it targeted for
tracking and questioning—journalists
who were reporting on the administra-
tion’s cruel treatment of migrants at
the southern border. Border agents
have even detained journalists—Amer-
ican citizens—and subjected them to
prying and detailed questions about
their travel and their work.
Most ominously, over and over, he
called journalists enemies of the peo-
ple. That is language that is designed
to justify state repression or vigilante
violence against journalists. It is also
language that comes, unfortunately,
directly from the worst dictators in
history. That is based on the record,
based on the public statements I am
walking through tonight. That is what
Donald Trump thinks of the press,
which is why the Saudis told him that
Jamal Khashoggi was an enemy of the
state.
As far as I can tell, the President
seems to believe that first amendment
freedom of the press basically should
only apply to people who say nice
things about him.
I don’t know of any such provision in
the First Amendment about which the
Founding Fathers felt so strongly.
They thought freedom of the press was
almost as important as anything else
people could imagine. The Founding
Fathers didn’t in any way suggest the
First Amendment applies to discussing
only nice things about someone who is
a public official. Reporting facts to the
public on corruption in the administra-
tion and the President’s tax cheating,
on the administration policy of locking
up migrant children in cages without
beds, soap, or toothbrushes—Donald
Trump evidently considers all of this
to be a treasonous act.
The brutal, premeditated murder of
Jamal Khashoggi is, in my view, the
canary in the coal mine for press free-
dom around the world. These are dan-
gerous times for journalists. It is al-
ready a dangerous career in many
countries. If dictators see the killing of
Jamal Khashoggi as a signal that they,
too, can get away with cold-blooded
murder, then the question is, How
many more journalists and dissidents
are going to die?
That is why, as a member of the In-
telligence Committee, I am tonight
drawing the line right here. For me,
the events of the last week have only
highlighted the urgency of this issue.
In a nationally televised interview
aired just yesterday, Donald Trump
was asked repeatedly about the murder
of Jamal Khashoggi. Each time he kept
coming back to Saudi money. He said:
‘‘Take their money.’’ And he repeated
it: ‘‘Take their money.’’
I disagree that U.S. arms sales to
Saudi Arabia somehow mean that they
have all the leverage and that the
United States is helpless, but even
more important, the message that im-
punity for a brutal murder can be
bought is both repulsive and dan-
gerous.
Right now, Donald Trump is telling
the Saudis and every other dictator in
the world that for the right price, you
can murder a U.S.-based journalist you
don’t like. You can dismember his
body, and you can make it disappear.
As far as Donald Trump is concerned,
what we have seen recently is that the
lives of journalists are for sale.
In the same interview, Donald Trump
was also asked about the U.N.’s call for
an investigation into the Khashoggi
murder. He made it clear that, again,
he would resist any public account-
ability. He said the murder had already
been ‘‘heavily investigated’’ and that
he had seen ‘‘so many different re-
ports.’’ Well, it is time for the Amer-
ican people, the Congress, and everyone
around the world fighting for press
freedom to see the reports.
Something else happened last week
that I thought was also very important
for the Senate to reflect on. Jamal
Khashoggi’s fiancee wrote an ex-
tremely important essay in the New
York Times. She wrote: ‘‘Washington
has chosen not to use its strong ties
and leverage with Riyadh to get the
Saudis to reveal the truth about
Jamal’s murder and to ensure those re-
sponsible are held accountable.’’
Jamal Khashoggi’s fiancee described
her meetings with Members of Con-
gress who are sympathetic but were
embarrassed that nothing had been
done, and this is what she concluded:
‘‘I began to feel that Jamal had not
only died in Istanbul but also in Wash-
ington.’’
This must not be the last chapter.
The U.S. Congress must demonstrate
that the fight for press freedom does
not die in the Nation’s Capital.
To describe how I intend to proceed
here, you have to give a little bit of a
sense of how the Intelligence Com-
mittee works. The Intelligence Com-
mittee accepts as boilerplate that we
always keep classified what are called

sources and methods. It is just auto-
matic in the consideration of any busi-
ness before us and before the Congress.
That is because we so admire—I know
the Presiding Officer feels this way—we
so admire those who work in the intel-
ligence field and in the national secu-
rity field, and should sources and
methods be exposed, we can have peo-
ple who are helping to keep us safe die.
So we put it in every bill.
In order to get my amendment to
make sure that we would actually have
the American people get the informa-
tion that the intelligence community
has about how Mr. Khashoggi died, I
accepted boilerplate language about
protecting sources and methods. But I
want to be clear—because the intel-
ligence community has, in effect,
bobbed and weaved around this issue
for some time—that if the intelligence
community attempts to use that
boilerplate language to avoid real ac-
countability and real transparency, I
am going to fight them tooth and nail,
and that includes using the procedure,
which I will describe tonight, that is
available to members of the Senate
committee to get information to the
American people.
I am going to be specific here just for
a moment. I am going to describe sec-
tion 8 of S. Res. 400, which allows mem-
bers of the Intelligence Committee to
initiate a process that ultimately
would permit the Senate to release in-
formation over the objection of the
President of the United States. I don’t
make this statement lightly. I don’t
make threats lightly, and I hope it
doesn’t come to this.
I hope the intelligence community fi-
nally adheres to the intent of the pro-
vision in this legislation and tells the
American people and the world what it
knows about the death of Mr.
Khashoggi. But if the intelligence com-
munity stonewalls again—once again
blocks the truth from the American
people—I am not going to rest. The
stakes are too high. Press freedom here
and around the world must survive. In-
timidation and murder cannot be al-
lowed to stand.
I state tonight that I will use S. Res.
400 and every tool at my disposal to fi-
nally get this long overdue information
about the death of Jamal Khashoggi to
the American people.
I yield the floor.
I note that my colleague from Or-
egon, who is doing important work, is
here and I am sure wishes to speak
now.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SUL-
LIVAN). The Senator from Oregon.

CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, this
Chamber has the responsibility to de-
bate tough issues that face our Nation.
It has been devoid of such tough de-
bates now for a very long time, essen-
tially failing to perform its responsibil-
ities to the American people under the
vision of our Constitution. I am more
troubled at this moment about this
failure than any previous moment be-
cause, at this moment, the drums of
war are beating, and this Chamber
stays silent.
At this moment, we have a bill before
us to address security issues. Yet we
are being denied the chance to debate
the most important security issue of
all—whether or not the United States
goes to war.
The question before us in the amend-
ment put forward by TOM UDALL of
New Mexico and TIM KAINE of Virginia
is this: Has there already been an au-
thorization by this body for the Presi-
dent to go to war against Iran? Their
amendment answers this question. It
says with great clarity that the answer
is no. The President does not have au-
thority to go to war. The power to
make that decision is vested with Con-
gress, and no bending and twisting and
contorting of any previous authority
can be used in this situation. That is
what their amendment says. It says:
Mr. President, if you want to go to war,
you have to come to Congress to get
authority—authority voted on after
the date of their amendment.
It is a fundamental question: Are we
going to follow the Constitution or
not? When our Framers were working
on the Constitution, many feared that
a President would become a King, and
many feared that Kings take countries
to war to the benefit of their treasure
and their power but to the disadvan-
tage of the people. But we are supposed
to be a country with a different vi-
sion—not government by and for a
King or by and for the powerful, but by
and for the people.
They debated this at great length
and decided with clarity and authority
that Presidents in the United States
would not have that power. Hamilton
wrote about this in his Federalist
Paper 69 in 1788:
The President is to be the commander-in-
chief of the army and navy. . . . In this re-
spect his authority would be nominally the
same with that of the king of Great Britain,
but in substance much inferior to it. It
would amount to nothing more than the su-
preme command and direction of the mili-
tary and naval forces . . . while that of the
British king extends to the DECLARING of
war.
This declares a huge difference be-
tween a kingship that can decide on
war, but here in America, it is the
power vested in this body—Congress.
At another point Hamilton wrote
that the President of the United States
‘‘would be an officer elected by the peo-
ple for FOUR years,’’ again, describing
the difference between a President and
a King. ‘‘[T]he king of Britain is a per-
petual and hereditary prince. . . . The
one would have a right to command the
military and naval forces of the na-
tion’’—the one being America, the
other being the King of Britain—‘‘pos-
sesses that of DECLARING war,’’ very
much emphasizing how important this
distinction is.
President Lincoln addressed this
when he was in office:
Allow the President to invade a neigh-
boring nation, whenever he shall deem it
necessary to repel an invasion and you allow
him to do so whenever he may choose to say
he deems it necessary for such purpose—and
you allow him to make war at pleasure. . . .
If, today, he should choose to say he thinks
it necessary to invade Canada to prevent the
British from invading us, how could you stop
him? You may say to him, ‘‘I see no prob-
ability of the British invading us,’’ but he
will say to you, ‘‘Be silent; I see it, if you
don’t.’’
Then Lincoln brings to bear that our
Constitution doesn’t allow this.
The provision of the Constitution
that gives the war-making power to
Congress was dictated, as I understand
it, for the following reason: that Kings
had always been involving and impov-
erishing their people in wars, pre-
tending generally, if not always, that
the good of the people was the object.
Our Convention understood this to be
the most oppressive of all kingly op-
pressions, and it resolved to so frame
the Constitution of the United States
that no man should hold the power of
bringing this oppression upon us.
These were powerful words from
President Lincoln in his describing the
Founders’ vision to make sure that no
one man, including the President,
holds the power to bring that oppres-
sion, the oppression of war, upon us.
James Madison’s notes of the debate
of the Constitutional Convention of
1787 revealed that when Pierce Butler,
of South Carolina, urged the President
be given the power to initiate a war,
the delegates overwhelmingly rejected
his proposal.
Elbridge Gerry, of Massachusetts,
said that he never expected to hear in
a republic a motion to empower the Ex-
ecutive to declare war.
George Mason, of Virginia, remarked
that he was ‘‘against giving the power
of war to the Executive’’ because the
President ‘‘is not safely to be trusted
with it.’’
Leader after leader said this power
must reside in Congress, not in the
President.
This list of the Founders’ vision goes
on and on, all to this fundamental
point: No one man—certainly not a
President—is given the power to de-
clare war.
While we are here on the Defense Au-
thorization Act, shouldn’t we debate
this issue? We have a President who,
regardless, claims he has complete
power to declare war. We have asked
members of his Cabinet: Do you respect
the Constitution? Will you come to
Congress and ask for authority if you
want to wage war against Iran? They
have refused to answer that question
time and again.
So we demand here on this floor that
we hold a debate on TOM UDALL and
TIM KAINE’s amendment that states,
very clearly, we have not authorized
war. You cannot take any prior author-
ization and bend and twist and contort
it to somehow say Congress has pro-
vided you this authority.
I expect, under debate, if we were
here listening to each other, this would

have broad, bipartisan support. All of
us took an oath to the Constitution. It
does nothing but restate the funda-
mental principle written into the Con-
stitution.
The drumbeat of war against Iran has
been steady—a continuous demeaning
of its every move. For sure, it does
many things that bother us a great
deal. Yet it is more than just being
concerned about its current activities
when I speak of the drumbeat of war; I
am talking about the fact that we
exited an agreement that we made with
Iran, the JCPOA agreement, which had
it dismantling all of its nuclear pro-
grams in exchange for some loosening
of economic restrictions. We exited it.
When we did that—when President
Trump pulled us out of it, he did ex-
actly what the rightwing said, what
the hard-liners in Iran said, which was
that America was not to be trusted,
that America will not stand by the
agreement. President Trump showed
Iran that it was right.
Then, in this tightening of the eco-
nomic restrictions by us that has en-
sued, we have made life difficult all
across the spectrum of Iranian civil-
ians, and we have created more support
for the rightwing, for the hard-liners,
for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard in
Iran—the folks who are the least inter-
ested in negotiating with the United
States of America, the folks who are
most interested in pursuing a nuclear
program. We have strengthened Iran,
within its country, with this action.
Then we deployed the Abraham Lin-
coln carrier strike group to the Persian
Gulf. One of our carrier strike forces is
immensely powerful. It is able to rain
down bombs on a vast number of cities
in short order with there being massive
destruction that symbolizes and em-
bodies that power.
It is not just that. We deployed a B–
52 squadron to the region, and it has an
immense, heavy lifting, bombing capa-
bility as well.
It is not just that. The Iranian econ-
omy, while it suffered under quotas,
still had some ability to sell some oil
and therefore an ability to alleviate
some suffering within its country eco-
nomically. We cut off those waivers.
Now they are really hard-pressed.
So we empowered the rightwing. We
strengthened the citizens of Iran to
support the hard-liners, and the hard-
liners then did something like shoot
down an American drone, and we came
this close to going to war.
Our President’s—President
Trump’s—inner Cabinet recommended
our bombing Iran in retaliation. It was
at the last moment that President
Trump apparently recognized that Iran
had shot down an unmanned drone and
that we were going to conduct a bomb-
ing campaign that might kill 150 peo-
ple, but that would not have been pro-
portional. His observation was right.
Yet where were his advisers when talk-
ing about proportionality—his advisers
who had been beating this drumbeat of
war, who had looked for a trigger, an
opportunity to unleash the forces that
had been pre-positioned in the gulf by
the United States of America?
Shouldn’t we demand the President fol-
low the Constitution?
We must debate this amendment—
the Udall-Kaine amendment—on this
floor. Let people vote no or yes accord-
ing to their opinions, but let us listen
to each other. Let us argue about one
of the most important issues a nation
can ever argue about—the power to go
to war.
I hope my colleagues here in the Sen-
ate will read the commentary by the
Founders and by those who came later.
I was struck that Jefferson, who was
very involved in the structuring of the
Constitution, talked about putting a
leash on the dogs of war by transfer-
ring the power from the executive to
the legislative. Yet he didn’t just talk
the talk; he walked the walk. He wrote
a message to Congress in 1805: ‘‘Consid-
ering that Congress alone is constitu-
tionally invested with the power of
changing our condition from peace to
war, I have thought it my duty to
await their authority for using force.’’
Jefferson talked the talk, and he
walked the walk. Are we going to walk
the walk? Are we going to stand by and
not even debate the issue?
Let us have the Senate be the Senate
and put amendments before this body
on issues that are important to this
Nation. We are on a bill about the secu-
rity of the Nation. There is no better
time in the future than now.
Are we to come together after war
has been unleashed and then hold a de-
bate on whether it was authorized? Can
we not send clarity now or at least de-
bate as to whether to send clarity now
that, indeed, it is not authorized and
that the President must come to Con-
gress, as envisioned—as laid out in ar-
ticle I, section 8 of the Constitution?
Shouldn’t we have that debate now, not
after a conflict has started? The an-
swer is, yes, we should have the debate
now.

TRIBUTE TO MCARTHUR ‘‘MAC’’
WEDDLE
HON. GWEN MOORE
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay
tribute to the career and ongoing legacy of
McArthur ‘‘Mac’’ Weddle, of Northcott Neigh-
borhood House, where he has served for over
42 years and 19 as the Executive Director.
McArthur graduated from Milwaukee’s North
Division High School which is also my alma
mater. Further, he earned a degree in edu-
cation from the University of Wisconsin-Mil-
waukee.
As a young boy growing up in Milwaukee,
Mac was pulled under water by a strong un-
dercurrent in the Milwaukee River. He was
rescued from this life-threatening disaster by a
kid in the neighborhood with the reputation as
a troublemaker. Mac believe he was saved
because God had a special purpose for him.
Mac pursued a career in youth recreation, to
assist kids who were sometimes misguided
but had the potential to do good. This was his
passion, mission and special purpose. This
would lead him to Northcott Neighborhood
House a community organization where he
would assist in providing recreational activities
for youth, educational and employment train-
ing opportunities for adults and ex-offenders,
and necessities for families and senior citi-
zens. Mac would stay at Northcott and would
eventually serve as Executive Director and in
other many roles in our community.
Throughout the years, our community could
always count on him to invest and make pro-
grams such as Juneteenth Day, Black Expo,
African World Festival, and other events avail-
able to the community to celebrate our collec-
tive history. Under his guidance, he helped
transform Milwaukee’s Juneteenth celebration
to one of the largest in the nation, and North-
cott Neighborhood House to one of the lead-
ing organizations in Milwaukee’s African Amer-
ican Community and the Greater Milwaukee
Community. He is the recipient of the Black
Excellence Award, served as Chairman of the
Lee Elementary School Council, Vice Presi-
dent of the Board of Directors of the Martin
Luther King Economic Development Corpora-
tion, board member of Wisconsin State Board
of Psychology Regulations and Licensing,
Treasurer of the Board of Harambee Ombuds-
man Program, and as a 33-degree Prince Hall
Free and Accepted Mason.
It is without question that he has become
one of the most beloved community leaders,
mentors, and advocates in our city. This is
due in no small part because of his investment
in the children and the many lives he has im-
pacted. Mac’s leadership, enthusiasm and
generosity is unparalleled, and he is held in
high-esteem throughout the community. I have
known Mac for over 50 years and I am proud
to say that Mac is my friend. We have so
many shared memories of Milwaukee and life.
As he transitions into a new direction in his
life, I wish him the very best. While his retire-
ment will undoubtedly leave a void in our com-
munity, I take comfort in the fact that his role
in the development of our youth has created
new emerging leaders. Madam Speaker, for
these reasons I am pleased to honor McArthur
‘‘Mac’’ Weddle, a man, who has helped to
make the 4th Congressional District a better
place.

CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF
MR. DOUGLAS PRICHARD
HON. TED LIEU
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to celebrate the career of Mr. Doug-
las Prichard, the City Manager of Rolling Hills
Estates in Los Angeles County. Douglas is re-
tiring after 34 years of service to the city.
Douglas was born on December 28, 1957 in
Newport Beach, California to John Prichard
and Eleanor Farmer Prichard. He earned his
Bachelor’s in Social Ecology in 1980 and Mas-
ters in Business and Public Administration
from the University of California, Irvine in
1981.
Douglas’ first job in civil service was as an
administrative assistant for the City of Bell-
flower, where he eventually rose to Assistant
to the City Administrator. In 1985, Douglas
moved to the Palos Verdes Peninsula to be-
come the Assistant City Manager for Rolling
Hills Estates. He was promoted to City Man-
ager in 1990, where he oversaw the day to
day municipal functions of the city and its $9
million budget. Douglas maintained a balanced
budget, even through the Great Recession,
with little to no deterioration in services for
residents.
Under Douglas’ remarkable administration,
Rolling Hills Estates saw an expansion of the
city’s green space, with careful partnerships
crucial to the creation of Highridge Park and
the Chandler Preserve. Douglas also aided in
the development of the old Chandler Quarry,
construction of the western portion of Palos
Verdes Drive North and the Peter Weber
Equestrian Center Stables, and establishment
of the Peninsula Holiday Parade of Lights, an
annual community-wide celebration of the holi-
day season.
I wish Douglas a happy retirement full of
surfing and music, as well as quality time with
his wife, Kathy, and his children, John and Mi-
chael. I would like to express my sincere grati-
tude for his dedication to improving city serv-
ices and programs for the residents of Rolling
Hills Estates.

TRIBUTE TO FATHER DAVID
GARCIA
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker,
today I rise in honor of Father David Garcia
who is retiring from active ministry as Pastor
of Mission Concepción in my hometown of
San Antonio. Father Garcia is well-known in
the community and has been critical in pre-
serving and establishing worldwide recognition
of San Antonio’s historic missions. Although
his retirement from parochial service begins
July 1, 2019, I have no doubt that Father Gar-
cia’s impact will last in the years to come.
Father David Garcia, better known as ‘‘Fa-
ther David,’’ was born in San Antonio, Texas
on August 4, 1949. He completed seminary

IN RECOGNITION OF M. EUGENE
ZEUSKE’S 95TH BIRTHDAY
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor M. Eugene Zeuske of
Shawano, Wisconsin on celebrating his 95th
birthday. One of 5 children whose grand-
parents immigrated from Norway and Ger-
many, Gene was born at home and raised on
the family dairy farm along the banks of the
Wolf River in Waupaca County.
Gene was a hard worker. He worked end-
lessly on the farm and still found time to grad-
uate from Clintonville High School. He began
working ‘‘off the farm,’’ performing a number of
jobs for the Four Wheel Drive in Clintonville.
Gene served our country in the Army
Airforce Corps during World War II, stationed
at Sheppard Air Force base in Texas. Last
year, he was one of four WWII Veterans on
his Stars and Stripes Honor Flight.
His love of dairy farms was a natural spring-
board when he worked for Midwest Breeders
in Shawano, and later as the Langlade County
representative with the Farm Bureau. There, in
Antigo, he met Viola Ourada, who became his
wife of 68 years until her passing in 2018.
Gene and Vi transferred to Waupaca County
with Farm Bureau, finally moving to Shawano
where they were licensed insurance agents.
Together, they owned and grew their agency
over the next 30 years and were recognized
with many awards for their success.
Gene followed the path of public service
started by his grandfather who had served in
the state legislature, county and town board,
and his mother, a teacher and member of the
school board.
Gene served decades in appointed posi-
tions. He was appointed by the Mayor as com-
missioner of the Shawano Police and Fire
Commission, Shawano Municipal Utilities, and
a founding commissioner of Badger Power
Marketing Authority. Gene was elected as a
county delegate to the Wisconsin Conserva-
tion Congress for over twenty years and was
the county representative to the East Central
Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission for
four Governors.
Gene believes in giving back to the commu-
nity, and he organized the first United Way
campaign for Shawano, served as co-chair; he
rebuilt and reopened the Shawano Lake Gun
Club; he was an active member of Shawano
Jaycees, Shawano Lions Club, VFW and adult
leader for the Boy Scouts of America.
Gene has been a loyal and active member
of the Shawano County Republican Party for
over the last 60 years, winning many awards
at the local and state levels for his unwavering
dedication.
Gene still lives in his home in Shawano on
the Wolf River channel and remains active as
an Amsoil dealer and works his farmland next
to his childhood home. Always the avid hunter
and fisherman, Gene purchased and rebuilt a
century old fishing cabin in Canada where he
continues to visit several times a year.
Celebrating Gene’s birthday are his friends
and family; 3 children and their spouses, Todd
(Terry), Candee Arndt (Ray), and Cathy Gard
(John), 7 grandchildren and one great-grand-
daughter.
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this
body to join me in applauding Gene Zeuske
for his many years of public service and vol-
unteerism, and wish him a happy and healthy
95th birthday.

CONGRATULATING THE COLUMBIA
CITY ROTARY CLUB
HON. JIM BANKS
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
congratulate the Columbia City Rotary Club on
their 100th anniversary and express my appre-
ciation for their hard work in making Columbia
City a better place to live, work and raise a
family. As an organization heavily involved in
many civic activities, the Columbia City Rotary
Club has established itself as one of the finest
service organizations in northeast Indiana.
As a native of Columbia City and fellow Co-
lumbia City Rotarian who once had the honor
of serving as club president, this is an organi-
zation that will always occupy a special place
in my heart. To this day, I still apply the Four-
Way Test when making decisions as a law-
maker on Capitol Hill and do my best to live
by the Rotarian motto of ‘‘Service Above Self.’’
I also am constantly reminded of the unbreak-
able friendships and shared civic duty of Ro-
tarians I have met along the way.
Organizations like the Columbia City Rotary
Club provide the backbone for towns and cit-
ies across the country, selflessly taking it upon
themselves to improve their surroundings and
the lives of those around them. I could not be
prouder to recognize this anniversary and wish
them only the best in their next century.

HONORING THE LADIES UNION BE-
NEVOLENT ASSOCIATION OF ST.
JOSEPH
HON. SAM GRAVES
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker,
I proudly pause to recognize the Ladies Union
Benevolent Association. The Ladies Union Be-
nevolent Association is a very special em-
ployer who is being honored with the Em-
ployer of Excellence Award as a part of the St.
Joseph YWCA’s prestigious Women of Excel-
lence.
For more than 120 years, the Ladies Union
Benevolent Association, through the Noyes
Home, has been a place where a child who is
facing a family crisis feels safe, and can just
be a child, until the family is able to get back
on its feet. It’s where a teen finds friendship,
security, and a positive environment to con-
tinue attending high school if a parent has be-
come incarcerated or is unable to care for
them. Infants, children and teens can live at
the Noyes Home for as long as needed while
a family strives to find solutions, with service
provided until a child turns 18. There is no fi-
nancial obligation to the family. The Noyes
Home is, above all, a home.
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join
me in congratulating the Ladies Union Benev-
olent Association for winning the Employer of
Excellence Award. They are an exceptional or-
ganization in St. Joseph, Missouri, and I am
proud to represent them in the United States
Congress.

Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in
congratulating the Camdenton LASER 3284
robotics team on their great success at the
2019 FIRST Robotics World Championship.
For Inspiration and Recognition of Science
and Technology (FIRST) Robotics Competition
is held each year for robotics teams around
the country to compete and display their inge-
nuity. Camdenton LASER 3284 has competed
in this competition since 2010, and every year
the team has taken home numerous awards
for their work and team spirit. This year, the
team built a 125-pound robot, named Decen-
nium, stemming from the Latin root ‘‘dec,’’ to
commemorate their 10th year of competition.
Decennium competed in the Deep Space
FIRST Competition. The robot exemplified the
team’s creativity and bright innovation, making
the quarterfinals in their division, bringing
home the World Championship division Under-
writer Laboratory Safety award for the third
consecutive year, and receiving the highly es-
teemed Engineering Inspiration Award. This
award is given to the team that most dem-
onstrates outstanding success in advancing
the respect and appreciation of engineering
within the team’s school, community and be-
yond.
Camdenton LASER 3284 team is no strang-
er to hard work, building community, and team
pride. This is evident in the history of the
team’s achievements, and this year because
of their great success they have prequalified
for the World Championship in 2020.
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in
congratulating the members of Camdenton
LASER 3284 team, Maya, Vanessa, Zane and
Nick for a job well done.

HON. RICHARD HUDSON
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Captain Logan Herndon and
Lieutenant William Jackson as recipients of
the Public Safety Valor Award.
The Valor Award is a prestigious honor pre-
sented to first responders of the greater Fay-
etteville region who perform acts of heroism
under extreme risk. Captain Herndon and
Lieutenant Jackson proudly serve the Fayette-
ville Fire Department and went above the nor-
mal call of duty in January 2019.
After responding to a motor vehicle acci-
dent, Captain Herndon and Lieutenant Jack-
son began to routinely assist Cumberland
County EMS and the Fayetteville Police De-
partment. As they worked, unusual commotion
could be heard from an ambulance where one
of the motorists was being treated. Calls for
help came from the ambulance and as Cap-
tain Herndon and Lieutenant Jackson rushed
over, they found a police officer in a physical
altercation with the motorist. They responded
forcefully, quickly securing the scene.
Captain Herndon and Lieutenant Jackson’s
quick actions may have saved the lives of
their colleagues, as a loaded firearm was
found in the offender’s possession. I know I
speak for everyone in our community when I
say we are truly grateful for their unwavering
service and cannot thank them enough.
Captain Logan Herndon and Lieutenant Wil-

I would like to offer my sincerest appreciation
and wish them success as they continue to
protect our communities.

IN HONOR OF PAUL SEARS
HON. ANDY BARR
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life of a special man, Paul Sears, of
Lexington, Kentucky. Born in 1924, Dr. Sears
enlisted in the Army Air Corps on October 25,
1942. He was assigned to the 100th Bomb
Group, also known as the ‘‘Bloody Hun-
dredth’’, in the 8th Air Force. Sears was a
tailgunner on a B–17. On his very first mis-
sion, half of his 6 plane squadron was lost.
On his tenth and final mission, Dr. Sears’
aircraft, ‘‘Salvo Sal’’, was hit over Germany on
October 8, 1943. Sears bailed out over the
Netherlands and was captured by the Ger-
mans. He was held in solitary confinement for
17 days in Frankfurt, Germany. After a 3-day
ride in a cattle car, he was taken to Stalag
17b where he spent the next 19 months just
trying to survive. Conditions were brutal, with
prisoners living on small portions of black
bread and cabbage soup that included worms.
Sears lost 65 pounds, contracted a severe
respiratory infection, and almost died. In April
of 1944, Sears and around 4,500 other POWs
were forced to march over 200 miles west,
away from the Russian Army and towards the
American lines. The prisoners were liberated
by General Patton’s 3rd Army on May 3, 1945.
Dr. Sears returned home and married Jua-
nita Reed Sears. Together they raised 2 girls,
Anne and Elizabeth ‘‘Lizzy’’ Sears Brown.
Under the G.I. Bill, Paul Sears entered the
University of Kentucky where he earned a
B.S. in 1950 and a Ph.D. in 1953. He spent
most of his professional career at the Univer-
sity of Kentucky as a chemistry professor. He
was recognized with two Outstanding Teacher
Awards, recognized internationally for his re-
search, and held several leadership positions
at the University of Kentucky. He retired in
1990.
Dr. Sears and his fellow veterans are true
heroes. As members of the ‘‘Greatest Genera-
tion’’, they willingly served to protect and de-
fend the freedoms that we enjoy today. I am
humbled to honor the service of Dr. Paul
Sears before the United States Congress.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF TIMOTHY
MILLS JOHNSON
HON. HENRY C. ‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, JR.
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today in loving remembrance of, and in
tribute to Mr. Timothy Mills Johnson, a long-
time Capitol Hill staffer with our former col-
leagues Mike Oxley and Spencer Bachus, and
the President of the Capitol Hill Tennis Club,
who passed away late last year.
Tim, as he was affectionately known on the
tennis court and in the halls of Congress, was
an outstanding staffer, great tennis player and
instructor, but most importantly, a friend to so
many staffers across both chambers and
across the aisles—and friendship is essential
to the soul.
To say that his was a life ‘‘well-lived,’’ is the
true meaning of understatement. But first, let
me tell you a little bit about Tim.
At an early age, Tim started playing tennis
under the tutelage of his grandfather Nelson
Turnell, a member of the Chautauqua Sports
Hall of Fame, and his uncle Daniel Turnell,
who played varsity tennis at the University of
Mississippi from 1965 to 1968. Tim’s competi-
tive tennis career started at Jamestown High
School, where he played for Coach Fred
Natarelli. Tim had standout seasons in 1977
and 1978 as first doubles on the JHS team. In
1977, Tim was undefeated at first doubles
playing in the Chautauqua-Cattaraugus Tennis
League.
Following high school, Tim attended Syra-
cuse University. He graduated in May 1982
with a double major in political science and
broadcast journalism, was on the Dean’s List
for five semesters, and was inducted into Phi
Beta Kappa, the academic honorary. During
the summer of 1980 in Jamestown, he pre-
pared, wrote, announced and produced radio
shows on news and sports for a radio reading
service for the disabled carried on a sub-chan-
nel of WHUG.
This led to Tim covering all five General
Conference on United States-Soviet Relations
at Chautauqua Institution from 1985 to 1989,
traveling to the Soviet Union, and received nu-
merous broadcasting awards for his efforts.
Following graduation, Tim worked at WKSN
radio and was active in the local tennis com-
munity until 1994, when he moved to Wash-
ington to work in Congress, as a fellow of the
American Political Science Association. Tim
worked as a legislative assistant to Congress-
man Mike Oxley of Ohio, who also was man-
ager of the Republican Congressional Base-
ball team, an annual tradition popular amongst
members of Congress, staff, and others. Tim
became the coach and one of the principal or-
ganizers for the game, a position that contin-
ued for nearly 20 years. Tim also happened to
be in the dugout during the tragic shooting at
Republican baseball practice in 2017.
For his work, Tim was quoted about the
Congressional baseball game in a variety of
publications, such as the Washington Post
and Roll Call. He worked tirelessly, as an un-
paid volunteer, to raise money by arranging
for sponsors for the Congressional baseball
game and was recognized in 2014 by the re-
spective team managers for his years of con-
tribution to the game, ranging from shagging
balls at 6:30 a.m. practices to organizing the
distribution of charitable giving.
Tim completed his career on the Hill in the
office of Congressman Spencer Bachus, serv-
ing as Communications Director until retire-
ment.
While Tim was a presence on the Hill during
the week, for almost 30 years he served as
president of the Capitol Hill Tennis Club,
which worked closely with the charity efforts of
numerous tennis-related organizations such as
the Cystic Fibrosis Celebrity Tennis Gala, the
Thanks USA, the Washington Kastles, the
Foundation for Prader-Willi Research, Hope
Street Kids, and the Washington Tennis and
Education Foundation (WTEF). For the WTEF,
Tim helped organize an annual celebrity tour-
nament where members of Congress, profes-
sional tennis players, Congressional staff,
community leaders, and others played to raise
money for critical causes around the country.
For many years, as part of his duties with
the CHTC, for countless weekends in the hot
sun of our nation’s capital, through his diag-
nosis, Tim had one of his toughest duties
keeping the peace among spirited Capitol Hill
staffers as he fed them tennis ball after ball,
rain or shine, and more often than not, helping
someone perfect a grip, shot, or foot move-
ment on the tennis court with his trademark
patience and equanimity.
Madam Speaker, right now, Tim is in Heav-
en, serving, and is up 40-Love, but instead of
raining down another serve, he gently guides
the ball over the net so as to keep the ball in
play and enjoy a long rally as he did for so
many of us during his sojourn here.

While responding to a domestic disturbance
where a man was reportedly holding his preg-

rived on the scene, he breached the apart-
ment door with an axe, quickly located the vic-
tim and her attacker, and saved the life of the
victim and her unborn baby after neutralizing
the threat.

IN APPRECIATION OF CHOBANI
PAYING SCHOOL LUNCH DEBT IN
TWIN FALLS, IDAHO
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON
OF IDAHO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the generous donation by
Chobani who paid the school lunch debt for
the entire Twin Falls School District for the
2018–2019 school year. This act of kindness
is just another example of Chobani’s commit-
ment to being a good neighbor in the Magic
Valley.
The State of Idaho is fortunate that Chobani
chose to build North America’s largest yogurt
plant in Twin Falls in 2012. Since arriving,
Chobani has benefited the local economy in-
cluding the dairy farmers in Idaho who supply
milk to the plant. It is estimated that Chobani’s
direct and indirect employment is roughly
7,000 jobs in Idaho including roughly 300 refu-
gees from the local center at the College of
Southern Idaho. Due to Chobani’s economic
success, additional food producing businesses
have located facilities in Twin Falls, which has
resulted in the local unemployment rate drop-
ping as low as 2.2 percent.
I believe any organization or business starts
with the tone set by their leader. Chobani ex-
emplifies that through their founder, chairman,
and CEO, Hamdi Ulukaya. I consider Hamdi a
friend to me and to the State of Idaho. Hamdi
grew up on a dairy farm in Turkey and immi-
grated to the United States in 1994. He took
over a yogurt factory in 2005 with a loan from
the Small Business Administration. Today, he
is the CEO of the number one strained yogurt
brand in the United States. He has shared his
generosity with local communities like Twin
Falls and also announced he would hand over
ten percent of the shares of the company to
its employees.
To quote the Twin Falls Mayor, ‘‘Chobani is
the gift that keeps on giving.’’ I thank Hamdi
and Chobani and I look forward to their future
growth and partnership with the State of
Idaho.

The Valor Award is a prestigious honor pre-

under extreme risk. A second-generation law
enforcement officer with the Cumberland
County Sheriff’s Department, Deputy Strick-
land exhibited great courage and composure
in the early morning hours of September 4,
2018.
While responding to a domestic disturbance
where a man was reportedly trying to force
entry into the home of a mother and her four
children, Deputy Strickland was fired upon
while arriving on the scene. He exited his ve-
hicle and returned fire, striking the offender
from 90 feet away. Deputy Strickland then he-
roically shielded a fellow officer and engaged
the subject so that she could seek cover. After
securing the scene, the officers sought med-
ical attention for the offender.
Deputy Strickland’s quick actions, excellent
marksmanship under extreme pressure, and
willingness to stand in front of a fellow officer
are a credit to him, his family, and the Cum-
berland Sheriff’s Department. I know I speak
for everyone in our community when I say we

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, it is my
pleasure to commend the Richlands High
School softball team, which captured the Vir-
ginia High School League (VHSL) Class 2
state title on June 14, 2019. The Lady Blues
put on a stellar performance, narrowly defeat-
ing an exceptional team from Madison County
High School by a score of 1 to 0.
This victory carries particular meaning, as it
is Richlands High School’s first softball state
championship in nearly 25 years. Their cham-
pionship caps a 23–5 season. I applaud the
hard work and dedication of all members of
this year’s Richlands High School softball
team, and congratulate the administrators,
teachers, coaches, parents, students, and
fans. In particular, I would like to recognize the
contributions of the team’s seniors, their pitch-
er, Mac Osborne, on being named the Virginia
2A State Player of the Year, and their head
coach Ronnie Davis. Congratulations on a
great end to the season.

HONORING THE LIFE OF AJA
GIOVANNI MCLEOD
HON. ANTHONY G. BROWN
OF MARYLAND
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to remember the life of Aja
Giovanni McLeod, a resident of Maryland’s 4th
Congressional District.
Born on August 10, 1996, Aja was one of
our brightest and most promising young peo-
ple. Only 22 years old, she will be remem-
bered for her tenacity, perseverance, and love
for her family and friends. Faced with health
challenges from birth, Aja remained committed
to her education and living a full life, pursuing
a career in communications. Her potential was
evident, as she earned several scholarships
during her educational career. Less than one
month before her passing she celebrated her
graduation from Bowie State University with a
BS in Communications.
The many remembrances of Aja have em-
phasized the special place in her heart for her
brother and best friend, Zion, who will carry
the memory of her love and devotion. In her
time on earth, Aja’s smile and laughter
brought joy to those fortunate enough to have
known and met her.
On June 8, 2019, Aja passed away unex-
pectedly, leaving behind her loving parents
Andre’ and Kimberly, and her brother Zion.
I ask the House of Representatives to join
me in remembering the life of Aja Giovanni
McLeod.

HONORING HILARY SALANKY
HON. SAM GRAVES
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker,
I proudly pause to recognize Hilary Salanky.
Hilary is a very special woman and leader who
is being honored with the Woman in the Work-
place Award as a part of the St. Joseph
YWCA’s prestigious Women of Excellence.
While spending her days teaching at Lafay-
ette High School, Hilary is helping just as
much to inspire and encourage the next gen-
eration of entrepreneurs through her outside of
the classroom work with Student Council,
DECA, and the Future Business Leaders of
America as well as coaching the Boys and
Girls track teams. She also manages to find
time to volunteer with the Junior League and
raise a family. It’s not nearly enough to say
that she is someone dedicated to improving
St. Joseph, but she also manages to multiply
her efforts by her dedication to the business
leaders of tomorrow.
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join
me in recognizing Hilary Salanky for being
honored as the Woman in the Workplace
Award winner by the St. Joseph YWCA
through serving St. Joseph, the state of Mis-
souri and the Sixth Congressional District. I
am honored to represent her in the United
States Congress.

Monday, June 24, 2019
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Charlotte Butz, the winner of
the 2019 Congressional Art Competition for
New York’s 21st Congressional District.
Charlotte graduates from Cambridge Central
School this week and will be attending James

Charlotte’s painting titled: Woman in Stripes,
demonstrates a high degree of technical abil-
ity, using light and shadow to evoke emotion.
I am proud knowing that my colleagues in
Congress, members of the public, and leaders
from around the world will see this beautiful
drawing on display in the Capitol throughout
the year. Charlotte’s painting serves as a true
testament to the artistic skill of our students
and quality of arts education in the North
Country. On behalf of New York’s 21st Con-
gressional District, I want to thank Charlotte
for sharing her work with us and congratulate
her on this well-deserved recognition.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF DR.
NELLIE MEYER
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the service of long-time ed-
ucator and community leader, Dr. Nellie
Meyer.
Dr. Meyer has dedicated her career to im-
proving education on various levels, ranging
from working as a middle school and high
school teacher to holding an array of leader-
ship positions, most recently as the Mount
Diablo Unified School District Superintendent.
Throughout her career, Dr. Meyer has advo-
cated for supporting at-risk youth, improving
student achievement, and giving students the
best education possible.
As the Mount Diablo Unified School District
Superintendent for the past six years, Dr.
Meyer focused on innovation and problem
solving. She was a leader in the California
City School Superintendents organization and
has written multiple articles in professional
education publications. Dr. Meyer has also
presented at numerous national conferences
on school turnaround, dropout prevention, and
best practices for school systems.
Dr. Meyer’s colleagues admire her sharp
mind, empathetic nature, ability to think out-
side the box, and her insistence that a district
has the responsibility to provide high quality
education to every student.
On June 24th, Dr. Meyer is transferring her
skills to the Los Altos/Mountain View Union
High School District to carry on her passion
for improving education for young people.
Please join me in wishing Dr. Meyer good luck
in her transition and thanking her for con-
tinuing her commitment to the youth of our
community.

2019.
After responding to reports of a fire inside
the home of a woman suffering from Alz-
heimer’s disease, the four of them searched
her 1,700 square foot home, extinguished the
fire, moved the victim to safety, and provided
her with medical assistance. Remarkably, they
accomplished this in only 5 minutes and 25
seconds. As firefighters Mark Frye and Sean
Gallagher initiated a rapid primary search to
find the victim with zero visibility, Captain

Eddie Jean Pullum coordinated a fire attack
made in order to provide the best chance of
survival for the victim.
This incredible display of teamwork and her-

I proudly pause to recognize Jo Eyberg. Jo is
a very special woman and leader who is being
honored with the Lifetime Achievement in the
Workplace Award as a part of the St. Joseph
YWCA’s prestigious Women of Excellence.
When you look at the number of organiza-
tions that Jo has volunteered, chaired or do-
nated to, it’s far easier to name the organiza-
tions she hasn’t worked with in St. Joseph. It’s
humbling when you consider the multitude of
lives she has touched over years and years of
dedicated volunteerism. To say that Jo is a
sterling example of unwavering service to her
community and an example of what we should
all hope to be is a great understatement.
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join
me in recognizing Jo Eyberg for her lifetime of
accomplishments serving St. Joseph, the state

trict. I am honored to represent her in the
United States Congress.

IN HONOR OF THE IMMUNE
DEFICIENCY FOUNDATION
HON. KEVIN BRADY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the Immune Deficiency Foundation
on the occasion of their biennial national con-
ference. On the weekend of June 20–22 more
than 1,300 people gathered at National Har-
bor, Maryland. As part of this conference, over
200 individuals impacted by primary immuno-
deficiency (PI) met with legislators here on
Capitol Hill to talk about important federal pub-
lic policy issues.
The Immune Deficiency Foundation (IDF),
which is based in Towson, Maryland, was
founded by Marcia Boyle in 1980 after her
son, John, nearly died as an infant from a
form of Pl. Roughly 40 years later, John now
serves as President & CEO of the Foundation
as it moves into its fifth decade. IDF advo-
cates for persons and families impacted by PI,
which are a spectrum of more than 350 rare
genetic disorders in which a person’s immune
system functions improperly or, in the most
severe forms, is missing completely. Persons
with PI face higher risk of infection, and even
a relatively mild cold can cause severe com-
plications. Some people go years or decades
suffering from recurring illnesses before being
properly diagnosed, though thankfully today
the most dangerous form of PI—Severe Com-
bined Immunodeficiency or SCID—can be di-
agnosed via newborn screening.
I have been fortunate to work with IDF
throughout my tenure in Congress. I was intro-
duced to the organization by my constituent
Carol Ann Demaret, who is a longtime mem-
ber of the IDF Board of Trustees. Carol Ann
is the mother of David Vetter, the Houston boy
who was affectionately known as the ‘‘boy in
the bubble.’’ David battled with SCID during
the 1970s until his untimely death in 1984.
Today, thanks to advances in science and
medicine, as well as in public policy, people
with SCID and other forms of PI can live
healthier and fuller lives if properly diagnosed
and treated. As of late last year, all 50 states
are screening for SCID as part of their new-
born screening program. This means children
like David Vetter who are born with SCID will
be diagnosed promptly after birth and be able
to undergo a bone marrow transplant or even
gene therapy to restore the immune system
they lack. This is no small accomplishment—
I know I speak for the Eighth District of Texas
when I say thank you to IDF for their great
work throughout the years.
For persons with less severe forms of PI,
treatment involving immunoglobulin or Ig re-
placement therapy is vitally important. Ig can
be administered intravenously (IVIG) or
subcutaneously (SCIG), providing patients and
their clinicians with treatment options.
Over the years, I have championed legisla-
tive efforts to ensure Medicare beneficiaries
have access to immunoglobulin therapies in
the comfort of their home. This includes the
ongoing Medicare IVIG bundled payment dem-
onstration that we are working to transition
into a permanent benefit over the coming
years as Medicare rolls out a larger home in-
fusion services benefit.
IDF, a true leader of the PI community, con-
tinues to support these important access
issues as well as other policies to advance
care for persons with Pl. These priorities in-
clude reauthorizing the successful Newborn
Screening Saves Lives Act and supporting
medical research and public health programs
focused on PI. It is particularly exciting that a
number of SCID gene therapy clinical trials
are ongoing, and I am most hopeful for and
optimistic about continued progress in the
field.
Madam Speaker, while I could not be in at-
tendance, I am proud to recognize the IDF
2019 National Conference and I look forward
to continuing to support the needs of the PI
community, I thank them for all they do and I
look forward to working with IDF on many
more issues in the future.

HONORING MARGARET ‘‘PEG’’
SEMINARIO
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the achievements of
Margaret ‘‘Peg’’ Seminario, who has made the
health and safety of American workers her
life’s work and is retiring after 42 years of tire-
less advocacy. Through her more than four
decades of work at the AFL–CIO, Peg has
been instrumental in securing the health and
lives of millions of workers.
Peg began her work at the AFL–CIO in
1977 during the early years of the Occupa-
tional Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA). She worked with many of the authors
of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of
1970 to develop the policies, win the court de-
cisions, and build the infrastructure that have
helped millions of American workers realize
their right to safe workplaces.
She worked closely with the labor leaders
who fought to pass the Occupational Safety
and Health Act and the Federal Mine Safety
and Health Act—George Taylor, Tony
Mazzocchi, Jack Sheehan and many others.
She played a major role in assembling the
evidence, preparing comments, testifying at
hearings, and assisting allies in passing al-
most every OSHA safety and health standard
over the past 42 years including: silica, beryl-
lium, asbestos, lead, noise, ergonomics, ma-
chine guarding, methylene chloride, lockout-
tagout, and workers’ Right-to-Know. These
standards prevented countless injuries, deaths
and occupational diseases.
She led the effort to protect working people
from occupational exposure to anthrax, bird
flu, SARS, workplace violence, and tuber-
culosis.
She led the fight to win passage of the
James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensa-
tion Act that provided health care and com-
pensation for the first responders who got sick
after they responded to the terrorist attacks on
September 11, 2001.
Peg served on numerous National Academy
of Sciences and federal advisory committees,
providing her expertise on a wide range of
workplace safety and health issues, including
the extent and nature of work-related injuries,
illnesses, and deaths occurring in the United
States.
Peg was also one of the first professional
women to work at the AFL–CIO, blazing the
path for those who followed, and she served
as a mentor for generations of women labor
leaders.
She advised those inside and outside the
labor movement on practical strategies to
move forward on seemingly insoluble issues.
As she kept workers’ goals in mind, her feet
were always planted in practical politics. She
approached the toughest political challenges
by asking a simple, familiar question: ‘‘What
makes sense?’’

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E825
June 24, 2019
Working with the business community and
other traditional foes of labor were part of her
strategic arsenal when that approach ‘‘made
sense’’ to accomplish the goals of working
people.
With an advanced degree in industrial hy-
giene from the Harvard School of Public
Health, she served as a trusted advisor to al-
most every Assistant Secretary of Labor for
OSHA—Democrat and Republican—over the
last 40 years.
Finally, she understood the role that worker
empowerment and labor unions play in ensur-
ing the safety of working women and men.
‘‘Let’s call Peg’’ was the first thing out of the
mouth of generations of members of Congress
and congressional staff. She testified before
numerous congressional committees and pro-
vided valuable information and advice to law-
makers on every budget, every piece of legis-
lation designed to strengthen worker protec-
tions, and every response to legislative efforts
to weaken or dismantle OSHA, the Mine Safe-
ty and Health Administration (MSHA) or the
National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health (NIOSH).
Madam Speaker, there are men and women
across the county who are alive today be-
cause of her work. They may not know who
she is. She will not receive their gratitude. But
they owe their health, their limbs and their
lives to the work she has done over 42 year
long career. I thank Peg for all that she has
done for America’s workers.

‘‘Live United’’ isn’t merely a slogan used for
public relations for the United Way, but a

HONORING THE CENTRAL
APPALACHIA HEALTH WAGON
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, it is my
honor to recognize the Central Appalachia
Health Wagon’s 20th annual Remote Area
Medical Wise Expedition clinic, taking place
from June 28 to June 30. Since 1980, the
Health Wagon has provided a wide range of
free mobile health services to medically under-
served areas in Southwest Virginia.
Central Appalachia Health Wagon has
partnered extensively with the Remote Area
Medical since 1998, which was founded by the
late Stan Brock. Today, it continues to serve
as the largest health outreach of its kind in the
United States and has been providing care to
Southwest Virginia and the surrounding region
for over 19 years.
In 2017 alone, the Remote Area Medical
Wise Expedition provided free dental, medical,
and eye care to over 3,000 patients, admin-
istering $1.4 million in value of medical care to
uninsured and underinsured Southwest Vir-
ginians. The poverty rate among the popu-
lation served by the Health Wagon is 70 per-
cent to 140 percent higher than in the rest of
Virginia; by delivering health care services to
those most in need; the Health Wagon has
played a vital role in addressing the substan-
tial health care disparities in the region.
I am proud to honor the Central Appalachia
Health Wagon and its Remote Area Medical
Wise Expedition clinic in its 20th year of serv-
ice, and to recognize the doctors, nurses, den-
tists, and volunteers who have dedicated their
time and energy to serving the people of
Southwest Virginia.

JOB CORPS CIVILIAN
CONSERVATION CENTERS
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, there were
a number of concerns raised about Job Corps
Civilian Conservation Centers (CCC) during
debate over my amendment to the LHHS Ap-
propriations bill, and I would like to respond to
those directly.
Contrary to the assertion that the transfer of
operations of all U.S. Department of Agri-
culture (USDA) Forest Service Job Corps
CCCs to the Department of Labor (DOL) will
‘‘allow more students to engage with the pro-
gram,’’ this move would have forced the im-
mediate closure of nine centers across eight
states, quite literally closing off DOL’s ability to
serve thousands of at-risk youth across the
country, while also negatively impacting the
rural communities these CCCs are built
around and reducing the Forest Service’s ca-
pacity as both wildfire and hurricane seasons
get underway.
During debate, it was also asserted that
CCCs produce ‘‘phenomenally bad results.’’ Of
the nine centers that were slated for closure,
seven of them were in top half of Job Corps
centers for Performance Year 2017, the most
recent program year data is available for. In
the state of North Carolina, where at least two
CCCs were slated for closure, the Lyndon B.
Johnson Job Corps Civilian Conservation Cen-
ter, the Oconaluftee Job Corps Civilian Con-
servation Center, and the Schenck Job Corps
Civilian Conservation Center rank 76th, 18th,
and 4th respectively out of all 126 Job Corps
sites. Schenck finished Program Year 2017 as
the country’s top performing Job Corps center.
While not a CCC, the Kittrell Job Corps Center
currently ranks sixth overall, meaning North
Carolina has three of the top 20 Job Corps
centers.
Concerns over the safety and security of
Job Corps sites were also consistently men-
tioned. In highlighting these concerns, no dis-
tinction was made between CCCs and regular
Job Corps sites. In Program Year 2017, CCCs
served more than 14 percent of Job Corps’
total residential students and accounted for
13.5 percent of total reported incidents of vio-
lence at Job Corps centers across the country.
This clearly shows that CCCs are not dis-
proportionately violent compared to other Job
Corps centers. It is important to note that the
high-profile crimes that occurred several years
ago did not occur on a Job Corps Civilian
Conservation Center site.
As was testified at a hearing last Congress,
the reality is that the mortality rate for Job
Corps center students in recent program years
was about 4.7 per 100,000. The national mor-
tality rate for individuals ages 16 to 24 during
that same time period was 70.88 per 100,000,
more than 15 times higher. Students at Job
Corps centers are also 19 times less likely to
die of a drug overdoes than youth their age
outside ofthe program.
That being said, I agree that we must do ev-
erything we can to minimize violence at Job
Corps centers. In the wake of tragic events in
2015, the National Job Corps Association
(NJCA) submitted policy recommendations to
DOL in order to improve safety and security.
Some of these recommendations have been
implemented while others have not. I believe
Congress can work together to ensure that
CCCs maximize safety while recruiting and re-
taining a high number of students.
Thankfully, the Trump Administration re-
versed its decision to end the CCC program.
CCCs are an important part of the Forest
Service’s mission, they play an essential role
in the health and safety of Oregon’s forests,
and they provide critical opportunities for at-
risk youth. I will continue to push back against
any future attacks and look forward to working
with those who want to further strengthen this
successful program.

HONORING THE 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE SACRIFICES OF
PFC CHARLES N. DEGLOPPER
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the 75th Anniversary
of the valiant heroism and sacrifice of Private
First-Class Charles Neilans DeGlopper during
World War II.
Charles N. DeGlopper was born in Grand
Island, New York on November 30, 1921. He
entered the United States Army in 1942, serv-
ing in deployments to North Africa, Sicily, Italy
and France.
With his C Company 1st Battalion under at-
tack, Private First Class DeGlopper volun-
teered to distract enemy troops so the C Com-
pany could establish the first Allied bridgehead
across the Mederet River at La Fiere, France.
He continued to fight in full view of the Ger-
man troops to defend his comrades, despite
being wounded several times. PFC
DeGlopper’s gallant and self-sacrificing actions
were an integral part of an important tactical
victory during the Battle of Normandy.
Private First Class DeGlopper was killed in
action on June 9th, 1944 at just 22 years of
age. In 1946 he was posthumously awarded
the Medal of Honor for heroically sacrificing
his life during the infamous Battle of Nor-
mandy. The official citation recognizes PFC
DeGlopper’s ‘‘gallant sacrifice and unflinching
heroism while facing unsurmountable odds.’’
The Medal of Honor is the highest award for
valor in action against enemy forces presented
to United States military personnel. PFC
DeGlopper was the only soldier from the 325th
Glider Infantry Regiment and the only member
of the 82nd Airborne Division of the U.S. Army
in the Normandy Campaign to be awarded the
Medal of Honor. For his service, he was also
awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star.
PFC DeGlopper has become the hallmark of
bravery and sacrifice in the Western New York
community and beyond. The U.S. Army Re-
serve Center in Tonawada is named in PFC
DeGlopper’s honor and the Charles N.
DeGlopper Memorial Veterans of Foreign
Wars Post No. 9249 in Grand Island honors
the service of DeGlopper through its work sup-
porting today’s veterans.
Madam Speaker, I proudly recognize a
hometown hero and true patriot, Private First
Class Charles DeGlopper. We, as a grateful
nation, are forever indebted for his valiant
service and incredible bravery 75 years ago.

amendment would require the study be com-
pleted no later than December 15, 2020.
The landscape of weather prediction and
forecasting in the U.S. has changed in the last
decade due to the tremendous growth of the
enterprise, which is made up of public, private,
and academic sectors. Despite new innova-
tions and technologies that have been devel-
oped, the U.S. currently finds itself trailing
other countries in weather modeling and fore-
casting capabilities when it was once the glob-
al leader.
We are at a crucial juncture, and it is impor-
tant to understand what the current challenges
the U.S. weather enterprise faces so that we
can improve U.S. weather modeling and fore-
casting capabilities and help the U.S. regain
international leadership in this field. Although
these sectors operate in complementary roles
to provide accurate and timely weather fore-
casts to the American public to protect life and
property, their individual goals don’t always
align in a way that provides the largest pos-
sible benefit to society.
A decadal survey would provide an oppor-
tunity to define a unified vision and long-term
goals for the private, academic, and govern-
ment sectors of the weather enterprise. This
survey would include a current assessment of
all sectors of the weather enterprise, and also
look back over the last five years to under-
stand how it has performed. Policymakers
would be able to use the decadal survey to
prioritize and guide future investments for the
next decade in science, weather modeling,
forecasting, data assimilation, and observation
technologies.
I urge my colleagues to support this amend-
ment.

SPEECH OF
HON. C.A. DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER
OF MARYLAND
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 19, 2019
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Madam Chair, I
support the need to increase federal invest-
ment in quantum information science at the
National Science Foundation (NSF).
Within the Research and Related Activities
account at NSF, I strongly support an increase
of $135 million above the fiscal year 2019
level for Quantum Information Science, as au-
thorized in the National Quantum Initiative Act.
This emerging field of science promises to
yield revolutionary new approaches to com-
puting, sensing and communication. NSF
should remain committed to developing and
supporting systems that facilitate tremendous
leaps in computational simulation, including ar-
tificial intelligence, storage, quantum com-
puting, and data analyses that enable a broad
range of scientific research. In following the in-
tent of the National Quantum Initiative Act, I
would hope the NSF would dedicate no less
than $85 million for Principal Investigator-led
Quantum Research and $50 million for five
NSF National Quantum Initiative Centers at
$10 million per center.
Quantum Information Science is critical to
our nation’s economy and national security.
With increased federal investment, we can ac-
celerate the development of real-world appli-
cations in areas such as infrastructure, climate
change, cybersecurity, medicine, communica-
tions, financial services and transportation.
The country most advanced in quantum
science and technology will reap huge eco-
nomic gains and enjoy a national security ad-
vantage. The University of Maryland College
Park, which I proudly attended, is home to a
thriving, unparalleled quantum hub. With more
than 175 researchers on-site, connections to
government and industry laboratories, and a
vast global research network, Maryland sci-
entists are leading the charge toward a quan-
tum future. This funding is critical to the state
of Maryland, to continued U.S. leadership in
this important field, and to our future.
I would hope to work together to discuss a
path forward to this increased investment in
Quantum Information Science.

Department of Energy (DOE).
Within the Science Account, I strongly sup-
port an additional $220 million above the fiscal
year 2019 level for Quantum Information
Science, as authorized in the National Quan-

lion toward activities authorized under section
401 of the National Quantum Initiative Act and
$100 million toward National Quantum Infor-
mation Science Research Centers, authorized
in Section 402 of the National Quantum Initia-
tive Act (five centers funded at $20 million
each).
Quantum information science is critical to
our nation’s economy and national security.

TRIBUTE IN CELEBRATION OF THE
60TH REUNION OF THE 1959
CLASS OF BURKE HIGH SCHOOL
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN
OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the 1959 class of Burke High
School of Charleston, South Carolina as they
celebrate their 60th class reunion. On June
29th and 30th, classmates and friends will
travel to ‘‘the Holy City’’ from all around the
world to take part in this significant celebra-
tion.
Burke High School, located on the west side
of the Charleston peninsula, was the city’s old-
est and largest public high school serving Afri-
can American students prior to the desegrega-
tion of public schools in Charleston. Founded
in 1894 as the Charleston Industrial Institute,
the original name and history of the school re-
flect the racial divisions and popular percep-
tions both students and teachers had to over-
come in pursuit of State supported public edu-
cation.
I personally remember some of these strug-
gles. My wife, Emily and I shared college ex-
periences with many of them and were a part
of the Charleston community during the 1960s
and 1970s; she as a librarian at Simonton
school and Burke and I as a social studies
and history teacher at Simonton and Charles
A. Brown High School on the east side of the
Charleston peninsula.
During the Civil Rights activities of the
1960s, many students from Burke became
local activists in pursuit of social justice in
Charleston. The class of 1959, along with
many of their schoolmates, took part in many
local demonstrations and sit-ins. Many of them
became active statewide as well.
The class of 1959 left a lasting impression
and everlasting legacy on Burke High School
students and citizens of the city of Charleston.
They led by precept and example. They also
gave back to the community by donating col-
lege scholarships to young graduates. Many of
them are still actively providing leadership in
communities throughout the country.
As they gather this year to celebrate their
60th reunion, I want to commend the class of
1959 for their continued dedication to their
alma mater. The shared experiences amongst
this class have served as an inspiration to
residents of Charleston, their families, and the
thousands of Burke students who have fol-
lowed them. Having been a part of some of
their activities, I know that all of their experi-
ences have not been pleasant, but I think they
would consider all of them to be blessings and
they have been blessings to many.
Madam Speaker, it is my great honor to rep-
resent this fine institution and many of its
graduates in this august body. I ask you and
my colleagues to join me in congratulating the
1959 class of Burke High School on their 60th
class reunion and wishing them continued
good health and great prosperity in the days
ahead.

ACT, 2020
SPEECH OF
HON. CHRIS STEWART
OF UTAH
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 18, 2019
The House in Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union had under
consideration the bill (H.R. 2740) making ap-
propriations for the Departments of Labor,
Health and Human Services, and Education,
and related agencies for the fiscal year end-
ing September 30, 2020, and for other pur-
poses:
Mr. STEWART. Madam Chair, I rise in sup-
port of my amendment which is being consid-
ered in En Bloc 2. My amendment regards the
important topic of Military Working Dogs
(MWD), commonly known War Dogs.
War Dogs play an important role protecting
our service men and women in combat and
non-combat zones all over the world. Speak-
ing on the importance of these working ani-
mals, General David Petraeus said that, ‘‘The
capability they bring to the fight cannot be rep-
licated by man or machine. By all measures of
performance, their yield outperforms any asset
we have in our inventory.’’
War dogs are trained to detect bombs—with
98 percent accuracy, sniff out drugs, track
people, and provide physical protection when
necessary. Staff Sgt. Andrew Mier of the DoD
Military Working Dog Program also said that
these dogs ‘‘create a strong psychological de-
terrent’’. It’s been shown that these animals
can inflict fear on enemies in a way that not
even armed soldiers can. Today, more than
2,300 War Dogs are deployed on active duty
and I, for one, am incredibly grateful for their
service.
In an effort to honor these heroes, my
amendment, No. 6 to Division C of H.R. 2740,
is a good government measure that will en-
sure War Dogs are returned to the United
States after they complete their service by
providing $200,000 to the Secretary of De-
fense for travel purposes.
Previously, if a War Dog retired from service
in a non-combat zone overseas, the handler
was given the option to adopt the animal. If
the handler declined to adopt, these animals
would be put up for adoption to civilian fami-
lies. If the dog was adopted, however, the new
owner was required to pay for the dog’s trans-
portation back to the United States.
Congress attempted to make it easier to get
these service dogs home by adding verbiage
to the National Defense Authorization Acts of
2014, 2016 and 2018, requiring the Depart-
ment of Defense to organize the return of re-
tired and retiring military dogs stateside.
Despite these requirements, the Department
of Defense has unfortunately still not adopted
a formal organizational plan to implement this
policy.
My amendment to Division C of H.R. 2740
restates Congress’s strong opinion that the
Department of Defense must formalize plans
across the services to ensure that these dogs
are able to return stateside after they retire
from active service.
These dogs selflessly give everything to
protect our service men and women. They de-
serve the same devotion from us. I strongly
believe they should be brought home, so they
can retire to a loving environment as a reward
for their hard work and loyalty. They are
American heroes and should be treated as
such.

HON. TERRI A. SEWELL

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker,
my amendment instructs the Secretary to sub-
mit to Congress an analysis on what re-
sources are needed to strengthen partnerships
between health and transportation providers.
According to the American Hospital Associa-
tion, 3.6 million Americans miss or delay med-
ical appointments because they lack a ride.
And another report tells us that missed
healthcare appointments cost the U.S. health
system $150 billion each year.
Many private healthcare organizations cur-
rently partner with ridesharing services. From
the recent expansion of supplemental benefits
under the Medicare Advantage program to the
Medicaid non-emergency medical transpor-
tation benefit, the Federal Government also in-
vests in programs aimed at addressing trans-
portation barriers to care.
As we continue our focus on reducing
health care costs, we must make sure medical
transportation programs are reliable, cost-effi-
cient and available to all Americans. I encour-
age adoption of my amendment.

OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the service of social justice
advocate and student, Jocelyn Villalobos.
Jocelyn is a first-generation student at Los
Medanos College and plans to pursue a Mas-
ter’s Degree in public health or nursing. In ad-
dition to her work on student government on
issues such as education equity and improving

lence and to promote safe educational envi-
ronments for undocumented youth.
Jocelyn is involved in many clubs and orga-
nizations including La Raza Unida, Outreach
Ambassador, Puente, Interfaith Space Com-
mittee, and Public Safety Committee. She re-
cently completed her one-year term as the
Student Trustee on the Contra Costa Commu-
nity College Board, which allowed her to
weigh in on important decisions for the Dis-
trict.
She has served on the Associated Students
at Los Medanos College for two years and just
completed her term as Commissioner of Cam-
pus Events. In 2017, Jocelyn’s commitment to
the community and advocacy for underrep-
resented students were recognized when she
received the Jefferson Award twice for her
public service as well as the Antioch Youth of
the Year award alongside her twin sister, Jac-
queline.
Please join me in wishing Jocelyn Villalobos
good luck with her endeavors in college and

COMMEMORATING THE 100-YEAR
ANNIVERSARY OF THE APPREN-
TICE SCHOOL IN NEWPORT
NEWS, VIRGINIA
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to commemorate the 100th Anniver-
sary of The Apprentice School in Newport
News, Virginia, which was founded in 1919 at
Newport News Shipbuilding.
The Apprentice School has been continually
recognized locally, regionally, nationally, and
globally as an extraordinary apprentice pro-
gram. It is a leading example of how appren-
tice programs have been redesigned to teach
a wide array of skilled trades, while also offer-
ing an educational program rich in academic
instruction, craft training, leadership, and ex-
tracurricular activities.
In its 100 year history, the Apprentice
School has graduated more than 10,800 ap-
prentices, with approximately 800 young men
and women currently enrolled in 28 different,
four-, five-, and eight-year apprenticeship pro-
grams. The Apprentice School provides an
academic curriculum that includes studies in
Mathematics, Physics, Strength of Materials,
Drafting, Marine Engineering, Shipbuilding Op-
erations, and Technical Communications,
among other disciplines, leading to a strong
technical education foundation.
The Apprentice School has contributed sig-
nificantly to Newport News Shipbuilding’s rep-
utation, tradition and success, producing com-
plex sea-faring vessels and passenger ships
to nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers
with the craftsmanship of highly skilled grad-
uates.
Representing 13 percent of Newport News
Shipbuilding’s total current workforce, grad-
uates of The Apprentice School comprise 60
percent of today’s general foremen and 45
percent of the production management team.
More than 70 percent of graduates are still
with the company 15 years after graduation,
and graduates are found at all levels of the or-
ganization, and all levels of management with
more than 3,000 graduates currently employed
in more than 230 different occupations.
To ensure that apprentices have many edu-
cation and employment opportunities, The Ap-
prentice School partners with local community
colleges and universities to deliver the related
academic component of these apprentice-
ships, which culminates in associate and
bachelor’s degrees. In addition, the school has
established articulation agreements with 10
colleges and universities, providing a seam-
less transfer of credits and continuing edu-
cation opportunities for graduates.
The Apprentice School is accredited by the
Commission of the Council on Occupational
Education. Their apprenticeship programs are
also recognized by and registered with the Vir-
ginia Apprenticeship Council, allowing appren-
tices the opportunity to earn college credit, re-
ceive competitive pay and benefits, learn a
trade, and foster the development of crafts-
manship, scholarship and leadership.
Over its 100-year history, The Apprentice
School at Newport News Shipbuilding has
proven its commitment to establishing robust
training and development programs intended
to develop and leverage the full potential of
the future workforce, and provide high-quality
opportunities for its students and the commu-
nity.
Madam Speaker, The Apprentice School
and Newport News Shipbuilding will gather for
a celebration this weekend to commemorate
this important milestone for the school. So as
they look back on the last 100 years, I know
that The Apprentice School and its graduates
will continue to make important contributions
to our nation’s shipbuilding industry over the
next 100 years.
