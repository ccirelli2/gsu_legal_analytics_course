75TH ANNIVERSARY OF OPER-
ATION DRAGOON AND THE
SOUTHERN FRANCE CAMPAIGN—
THE SECOND D-DAY IN FRANCE
AND THE LIBERATION OF
SOUTHERN FRANCE
HON. MARK E. GREEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 6, 2019
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in recognition of the upcoming
75th Anniversary of Operation Dragoon and
the Southern France Campaign—the Second
D-Day in France and the Liberation of South-
ern France.
Operation Dragoon began on 15 August
1944 and the subsequent Southern France
Campaign lasted until 14 September 1944.
The 7th US Army under Lieutenant General
Alexander M. Patch, commanded the VIth US
Corps under Major General Lucian K.
Truscott, II, comprised of three of the Army’s
most combat-experienced divisions—the 3rd
Infantry Division commanded by Major Gen-
eral John Wilson ‘‘Iron Mike’’ O’Daniel, the
36th Infantry Division commanded by Major
General John E. Dahlquist, and the 45th Infan-
try Division commanded by Major General Wil-
liam W. Eagles, and Corps troops; the 1st Air-
borne Task Force commanded by Brigadier
General Robert T. Frederick, the Canadian-
American 1st Special Service Force com-
manded by Colonel Edwin A. Walker; and
French Army B, later to be renamed the 1st
French Army, commanded by General Jean
de Lattre de Tassigny. Office of Strategic
Services (OSS) teams were inserted in the
months to link up with French Forces of the
Interior (FFI, or the Resistance) prior to pre-
pare for the invasion. The landing forces were
ably supported by the Mediterranean Allied Air
Force under Lieutenant General Ira C. Eaker
and the Western Naval Task Force under Vice
Admiral Henry K. Hewitt, conducted the sec-
ond largest amphibious landing in Europe on
15 August 1944.
The primary objective of Operation Dragoon
was to threaten the southern flank of Nazi
forces fighting in northern France. Further ob-
jectives were the seizing of the ports of Toulon
and Marseille to provide critical logistical sup-
port for Allied forces fighting in the whole of
France, the introduction of French forces into
France, and the stationing of Allied Air Forces
in Southern France to better support combat
operations.
Allied military personnel from France, the
United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada,
Greece, and Poland participated in Operation
Dragoon and provided critical air and naval
support to open the second front in Southern
France. 885 ships and landing craft, carrying
nearly 1,375 smaller landing craft, with their
crews, carried 151,000 troops; 21,400 trucks,
tanks, tank destroyers, prime-movers, bull-
dozers, tractors and other vehicles to the
beaches. Included were 40,850 French per-
sonnel and 2,610 vehicles of the 1st French
Army. 444 aircraft sorties and 408 glider sor-
ties delivered 6,488 paratroopers, 2,611 glider
troops, 213 pieces of artillery, and 221 vehi-
cles to the target area.
The 1st Airborne Task Force successfully
landed near LeMay, La Motte, and Les Arcs
causing serious disarray in German command
channels which prevented a rapid coordinated
response to the main force landings.
Draguignan fell on 16 August. The 1st Special
Service Force and cleared the offshore islands
of Port Cros and Levant to secure the south-
ern flank of the assault. Landing on the morn-
ing of 15 August all units successfully over-
whelmed German defense and expanded the
beachhead. The 3rd Infantry Division cleared
the St Tropez Peninsula, liberating the villages
of St Tropez and Cogolin after landing at
Ramatuelle, La Croix-Valmer, and Cavalaire-
sur-Mer. The 45th Infantry Division liberated
Ste Maxime and the 36th Infantry Division lib-
erated St Raphael. Fighting through the
Maures and Esterel massifs all units reached
the Blue Line, the point where the beachhead
could no longer be threatened by enemy
counterattack. On 17 August the Truscott’s
VIth Corps launched its aggressive pursuit of
German forces and through the speed of its
advance prevented the establishment of de-
fensive positions east of the Rhone River val-
ley. The Corps’ Task Force Butler, following
the historic Route Napoleon through the Mari-
time Alps, the 36th Infantry Division, and 45th
Infantry Division rapidly moved north in an ef-
fort to flank and trap the German 19th Army
withdrawing up the Rhone Valley with the 45th
Infantry Division liberating Barjols and clearing
the Valensole Plateau, TF Butler and the 36th
Infantry Division liberating Sisteron, Gap, and
Grenoble. The 3rd Infantry Division, attacked
west along the Argens Valley along the Route
National 7, guarding the northern flank of
French forces reducing Toulon and Marseille
and blocking a possible German counter-at-
tack, in the process liberating Le Luc (in co-
operation with the 45th Infantry Division and
French Armored Command Sudre)—a vital
road junction on National 7, Brignoles, and nu-
merous communities along the approach to
Aix-en-Provence including Vauvenargues and
Saint-Marc-Jaumegarde abutting Mont St.
Victoire. While Task Force Butler, then the
36th Infantry Division with attached units from
the 45th Infantry Division, fought in the
Montélimar Battle Square north of the city of
Montélimar from 21 to 29 August, the 3rd In-
fantry Division continued to press against 19th
Army rearguard forces, liberating numerous
communities including Aix-en-Provence, Avi-
gnon, Lancon Provence, Salon-de-Provence,
Orange, Chateauneuf-du-Pape, Bollene, St-
Paul-Trois-Chateaux, Valreas, Pierrelatte, La
Garde Adhemar and culminated at the impor-
tant city of Montélimar on 28 August. French
Army B liberated Toulon and Marseille on 28
August, taking 1,825 casualties but taking
11,000 Nazi prisoners.
On 29 August the 3rd Infantry Division es-
tablished contact with the 36th Infantry Divi-
sion near the villages of Sauzet and La Laupie
northeast of the city. The 1st Airborne Task
Force and 1st Special Service Force contin-
ued to guard the 7th Army’s right flank from
any German attack from Italy and reduced
German forces in the Maritime Alps along the
Italian Border—liberating the French Riviera
cities of Cannes, Nice and Grasse.
The 19th Army continued its withdrawal to-
wards Lyon, seeking to establish a coherent
defensive line to oppose 7th Army’s rapid ad-
vance, which drove first towards Lyon and
then shifted its axis to Dijon. The 7th Army lib-
erated Lyon on 3 September and continued to
press northeast to reach the Belfort Gap, the
traditional approach to the Rhine River Valley.
The 3rd Infantry Division liberated Besançon
on 7 September after a tough 3-day fight. The
speed of the 7th Army advance prevented the
19th Army’s anchoring its defense on Dijon, it
therefore withdrew towards the base of the
Vosges Mountains. Approaching the Vosges,
the VIth Corps’ three divisions faced stiffening
German resistance. The 3rd Infantry Division
liberated Vesoul on 12 September and by 14
September the Corps’ three divisions were po-
sitioned near the towns of Fougerolles,
Luxeuil, Lure, and Villersexel. French forces
made contact with elements of the 3rd Army
near Dijon on 11 September. With this junc-
ture of 3rd and 7th Army forces the Southern
France Campaign came to an end. The 6th
Army Group was activated on 15 September
and transferred from the Mediterranean The-
ater to GEN Eisenhower’s European Theater
of Operations. French forces under 7th Army
control were re-designated the 1st French
Army and became a separate command under
6th Army Group control.
Under the aggressive leadership of LTG
Patch, MG Truscott, and General Delattre de
Tassigny US and Allied forces of the 6th Army
Group and its supporting air and naval support
severely damaged the German 19th Army and
during the 30 day Southern France Campaign
moved over 400 miles from the landing beach-
es in Provence to link up with General Eisen-
hower’s forces fighting their way from
Nonnandy on 11 September 1944. Over 2/3 of
France were liberated in the space of one
month. French Forces of the Interior (the Re-
sistance) contributed tremendously to Dra-
goon’s success providing critical intelligence in
the preparation for the landings and with
countless small unit actions which harassed
Nazi forces throughout the campaign. In the
30-day campaign to liberate Southern France
the US forces suffered 4,500 battle casualties
and 5,300 non-battle casualties. Nazi forces
are assessed as having 7,000 killed in action;
21,000 wounded in action; and 131,250 pris-
oners of war.
Medals of Honor were awarded to the fol-
lowing 3rd Infantry Division soldiers during the
Southern France Campaign: SSG James P.
Connor, 15 August in Cavalaire-sur-Mer; SSG
Stanley Bender, 17 August in La Londe les

IN RECOGNITION OF ALPHAPOINTE
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 6, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Kansas City’s Alphapointe
for their 108 years of service to the blind and
visually impaired community. For the last cen-
tury, Alphapointe has worked to empower
those without sight to live independent and ful-
filling lives. The organization stands out as our
country’s third largest single employer of indi-
viduals experiencing vision loss, providing
meaningful jobs to over four-hundred people
across their nine locations.
Alphapointe traces its roots to Labor Day of
1911, when thirty advocates for the blind gath-
ered in Kansas City’s Budd Park to ‘‘promote
the social intercourse and general welfare of
those without sight,’’ leading to the establish-
ment of the Workers for the Blind of Greater
Kansas City. Present at this gathering were
Eugene E. Condon and his sister, Catherine
Hale. Determined to overcome his own vision
loss, Condon had enrolled at the Nebraska In-
stitute for the Blind in 1900, a residential
school that taught blind individuals the skills
needed to lead independent lives. Inspired by
the transformative impact that the institution
had on her brother, Hale set out to prove that
people without sight were fully capable of sup-
porting themselves when presented with op-
portunity.
Indeed, it was this campaign that led Hale
to accompany her brother to the rally in Budd
Park, and when she helped the Workers for
the Blind of Greater Kansas City incorporate
as the Kansas City Association for the Blind in
1916, Hale did so to create an organization
centered around the concept of helping the
blind help themselves. Now at the helm of
what would later be renamed Alphapointe,
Hale immediately took action to address the
rampant unemployment and lack of oppor-
tunity available for those throughout the city
experiencing vision loss. At the time, a mere
sixteen industrial programs existed in the
United States that trained and employed blind
individuals, but Hale knew that those without
sight need not rely only on charity. Hale’s
brother, for example, went on to attend the
Palmer School of Chiropractic while
Alphapointe’s Vice President, Hayes Brooks,
was the first blind student to graduate from the
Kansas City School of Law.
Taking inspiration from these two trail-
blazers, Hale opened a workshop in 1918
where eight blind workers assembled brooms,
mats, and cane chairs. Attached to the
brooms were labels that proudly asserted
‘‘The Blind Man’s Broom is the Best Broom,’’
and the project that began in Hale’s own living
room soon began to turn a profit. Notably, this
venture established Alphapointe’s reputation
not only as an employer of the blind, but as
a manufacturer of high-quality products, there-
by marking the beginning of a long tradition in
the organization’s history. A year later, fol-
lowing the conclusion of the First World War,
young men from across the country who had
lost their vision on battlefields overseas head-
ed to Kansas City in search of jobs and the
opportunity to lead dignified lives.
In addition to confronting the widespread
unemployment that plagued the blind commu-
nity, Hale was also determined to address the
housing problems that blind individuals faced.
In the early 1900s, life was quite dangerous
for people without sight, and blind individuals
were all too often institutionalized simply be-
cause they had nowhere else to live. In re-
sponse to this somber reality, Alphapointe
opened the Catherine Hale Home for Blind
Women in 1917, a place of refuge where
women who lost their vision were able to
peacefully spend the twilight of their lives. A
far cry from the facilities that less fortunate
blind senior citizens were forced into, the Hale
Home was known for its warm atmosphere in
which the forty residents cared for themselves,
maintained their favorite hobbies, socialized
amongst each other, and organized holiday
fundraisers. In operation until the late 1980s,
the Catherine Hale Home for Blind Women
symbolized Alphapointe’s commitment to serv-
ing senior citizens experiencing vision loss.
Moreover, Alphapointe and their workers
have repeatedly answered our nation’s call
during times of international conflict. In fact,
Alphapointe’s factory has supplied the United
States military in every war since World War
I. During the Second World War, for example,
Alphapointe was churning out an impressive
4,480 feet of tent rope every day, a feat which
earned the organization the prestigious Army-
Navy Production Award for Excellence in War
Production. Notably, Alphapointe was one of
only three factories with a blind workforce to
receive this honor. Later, as the United States
entered the Cold War, Alphapointe began
manufacturing sanitation kits for bomb shel-
ters, and in 2012, the organization created a
new Tactical Mechanical Tourniquet that will
soon be included in the first aid kits worn by
our men and women serving our country over-
seas. Additionally, Alphapointe now operates
base supply stores on Little Rock Air Force
Base and at Fort Leonard Wood, and the part-
nership between Alphapointe and America’s
military bears testament to the profound value
of blind workers and the quality of the prod-
ucts they can produce.
Today, Alphapointe offers a wide range of
services and opportunities to the blind and vis-
ually impaired community of the Greater Kan-
sas City area. Since its creation in 1952, the
Children’s Center for the Visually Impaired has
served thousands of blind youth. Through the
center, children learn life skills needed to over-
come the obstacles that come with vision loss,
including how to socialize with sighted children
and navigate unfamiliar locations. Further-
more, the Student Transitional Employment
Program has worked to address the high un-
employment rate that continues to hinder the
blind community. Additionally, Alphapointe’s
College Preparatory Program has ensured that
many blind students were able to successfully
adapt to their college campuses.
Alphapointe’s services, however, extend far
beyond one’s college years. At Alphapointe’s
Center for Blindness and Low Vision, a one-
of-a-kind facility in the state of Missouri, the
organization offers Comprehensive Rehabilita-
tion Services that address the challenges
faced by blind individuals throughout daily life.
Reflecting the Hale Home’s mission to keep
elderly blind individuals within their own
homes, the Senior Adult Services offered at
Alphapointe ensure that blind seniors can live
comfortably and independently for as long as
possible.
Madam Speaker, please join me in cele-
brating the work that Alphapointe has done for
the blind and visually impaired community
since 1911. For over a century, Alphapointe
has offered hope to individuals who often felt
hopeless, and their services have brought
great meaning, fulfillment, and dignity to the
lives of countless people facing vision loss.
Let us recognize this occasion by rejecting
any prejudices towards visually impaired
Americans which may still linger within our
country and by reflecting on the inherent value
of all people in the same spirit as founder
Catherine Hale.

greater Kansas City metropolitan area. Since
their opening, Dixon’s has served as a be-
loved pillar of the Kansas City and Independ-
ence communities, and it brings me pride to
have such an institution serving the Fifth Con-
gressional District of Missouri.
As one of the oldest family owned busi-
nesses in the city, Dixon’s Famous Chili origi-
nally began as a street vendor in downtown
Kansas City, Missouri. Due to the success of
the street cart, the Dixon family opened their
first parlor at 15th and Olive in 1919. In the
early days, the founder, Vergne Dixon, used
his entrepreneurial power to provide jobs for
the community. He hired only men who were
down on their luck to work at his parlor, giving
many a much-needed opportunity to better
themselves and support their families. Dixon
aspired to give back to his city and embodied
a spirit of public service that should inspire us
all.
In the 1940s, Dixon’s Chili Parlor acquired a
new and special meaning for the community
as it became a frequent stop for President
Harry Truman and became what he called one
of his favorite restaurants in America. Presi-
dent Truman said he loved to eat there as the
food reminded him of the days when he had
been serving in World War I. When President
Truman visited Dixon’s for his favorite dish of
chili on tamales, usually accompanied by sev-
eral Secret Service agents, the notoriety of the
event landed Dixon’s Chili Parlor in LIFE mag-
azine. Thus, Dixon’s came to be known as
Dixon’s Famous Chili.
Dixon’s Famous Chili continues today, as
the legacy has been kept alive by Vergne Dix-
on’s nephew Leonard Totta, his daughter Terri
Totta Smith, and will continue with his grand-
son Stephan Steffes. As the restaurant’s busi-
ness expanded, it grew to house numerous lo-
cations across the Kansas City metro area
and beyond. However, the main restaurant in
Independence, which President Truman fre-
quented, remains a cherished landmark in the
area. Long time guests share stories of gravi-
tating back to Dixon’s for a warm, familial at-
mosphere. Today, visitors to Missouri are
drawn to the authentic ambience at Dixon’s,
as well as the special ‘‘Kansas City style chili’’
served the same way it was one hundred
years ago, as a distinct way to experience our
local history.
Madam Speaker, please join me and all of
Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District in hon-
oring this legacy as Vergne Dixon’s family
celebrates one hundred years of remarkable
and noteworthy service in the Kansas City
metropolitan area. I welcome my colleagues to
join me and the constituents of Missouri’s Fifth
Congressional District in congratulations and
recognition of such an inspiration. Together,
we look to better serve those around us in the
same spirit as Mr. Dixon originally did and in
the same way his family continues to serve us
today.

HONORING UNITED STATES ARMY
SERGEANT FIRST CLASS RO-
LAND HAYES
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 6, 2019
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, in advance of Purple Heart Day 2019, we
are taking the time to honor those who have
earned the Purple Heart for sacrifices in serv-
ice to this Country. Today, we recognize Ro-
land Hayes, who received not one or two, but
three Purple Hearts while serving in the Viet-
nam War.
As a young man, Roland Hayes admired the
work of the military. He first learned about
radio waves as a student at Lackawanna High
School and was fascinated by the idea of war-
time communication. He was also inspired by
the bravery and skill of the Army’s 101st Air-
borne Division, a specialized infantry division
trained in air assault operations and the first
troops that dropped into action during World
War Two’s Invasion of Normandy. In 1966,
Hayes, just 18 years old, answered the inter-
nal tug to serve, voluntarily enlisted in the
United States Army, and was assigned to the
101st Airborne Division known as the
‘‘Screaming Eagles.’’ The 101st Airborne Divi-
sion fought in 45 different operations over al-
most 7 years and was the last Army division
to leave Vietnam. During this time, the 101st
made the important transition from utilizing
planes and parachutes to landing helicopters.
Hayes quickly experienced the same risky
operations that inspired his military career,
plunging him and his unit into the depths of
enemy territory. He was consistently part of
the first landing unit, an incredibly dangerous
position reserved for a group of highly-skilled
soldiers. These men constantly faced the pos-
sibility of death or injury given the uncertain
nature of their job. His division was the Army’s
most highly decorated airborne unit and Cap-
tain Paul Bucha from his battalion was award-
ed with the prestigious Medal of Honor for his
service in the Vietnam War.
Hayes’ tour in Vietnam had an action-
packed start. He arrived right before the Tet
Offensive, a major attack by the North Viet-
namese Army and Viet Cong on five cities in
South Vietnam. The coordinated attack took
place at the end of January, 1968 during the
Tet, a Vietnamese New Year celebration that
was traditionally a time of decreased fighting.
The Offensive was a huge surprise to the U.S.
military and South Vietnamese troops. During
the Viet Cong attack on the U.S. Embassy in
Saigon, the 101st Airborne made up the as-
sault force of paratroopers that landed on the
roof of the embassy and successfully removed
the Viet Cong from the premises. While this
battle was a technical victory for the United
States, the Viet Cong succeeded in inflicting
psychological damage on the American people
and military alike. The public had believed that
the Vietnam War would be an easy victory,
but the attack on the embassy foreshadowed
a military endeavor that was longer and more
complicated than anyone could have pre-
dicted.
On March 14th, 1968, Sgt. Hayes was in-
jured in action for the first time. While working
as an assistant machine gunner, a bullet rico-
cheted off the barrel of a machine gun and
went completely through his right leg. During
his hospital stay after the injury, he insisted on
receiving various combat reports from his unit
to stay up-to-date on the progress of the war.
He recalls feeling an incredible guilt for being
away from his unit when they needed him
most. Hayes told the doctor that if he did not
clear him to return to combat, he would go
AWOL in order to go back to his men. After
just four weeks of recovery, he returned to the
rough terrain of the Vietnamese jungle with a
partially healed leg, ready to continue fighting.
In August of the same year, Sergeant First
Class Hayes was shot a second time, now in
his left leg. His battalion had landed directly in
an enemy-controlled territory. Hayes ‘pulled
point,’ or stood at the front of the formation,
despite his high rank and the dangerous na-
ture of the position, because he was well-
versed in recognizing traps and other signs of
enemy presence. It was then that a bullet from
an enemy machine gun hit him, slicing away
a large piece of his left leg. Even with his own
injury, Hayes helped to save another wounded
soldier before returning to combat the same
day.
One month later, though his platoon be-
lieved that they had successfully taken over a
key North Vietnamese Army position, enemy
troops unexpectedly returned. Hayes stood up
to fire when a grenade landed directly next to
him. He recalls experiencing this moment in
slow motion: the grenade sluggishly rolling
down a slope away from him before it merci-
lessly imploded. A piece of it hit him in the
face, knocking him over. Fueled by pain and
rage, Hayes continued to fight only minutes
after his injury. The scar remains a visible re-
minder of that moment.
Like other African American veterans who
served, Sergeant First Class Hayes coura-
geously fought two battles: the war overseas
and the fight at home for equal rights. Hayes
comes from a long line of military trailblazers.
His father, aunt, and uncle all served during
WWII, defending our democracy while facing
unequal treatment both in segregated military
units and at home. Their participation in the
military during World War II helped plant the
seeds for the American Civil Rights Move-
ment. Another uncle, Sergeant Donald Rolls,
lost his life in the Korean War. Through the
Korean War, segregated African-American
units served in every war waged by the United
States, performing in both combat and support
capacities. The Vietnam War, which took
place at the height of the domestic Civil Rights
Movement, marked the first integrated U.S.
military. However, SFC Hayes was not free
from racial discrimination during his military
career. It was the first time that soldiers of all
races had worked together so closely, and he
recalls the rough integration process of his
battalion as well as the blatant discrimination
he experienced when he left his southern
training base. In 1967, he was deployed to
work as a cook on the military base in Viet-
nam. But his stint as a cook only lasted three
short weeks. After a racially-charged argument
with a highly-ranked officer, Hayes was or-
dered to the front line of combat. He believes
that he was given this difficult and dangerous
assignment as a punishment for perceived in-
subordination. Notwithstanding the unforeseen
change in assignment, Hayes entered his
company in Vietnam as a cook and left as a
Sergeant. Despite early racial tensions, ani-
mosity quickly drifted away as battles with the
enemy brought the men together. Hayes’ unit
soon realized that, with death and defeat on
the line, color and race meant nothing. Most
importantly, in order to leave together, the
men needed to fight together. In Hayes’
words, ‘‘the battlefield knows no colors.’’ This
mentality created a brotherly bond amongst
Vietnam War soldiers which had yet to be
seen in the U.S. The men’s selfless service
and sacrifice allowed them to abandon the so-
cial norms of the time and to recognize one
another as individuals.

E1036 August 6, 2019
Following his honorable discharge in 1968,
Sergeant First Class Hayes worked as a cit-
izen soldier in the Reserve and National
Guard branches of the Army. He served as a
Human Relations Instructor in the Air Force
Reserves from 1975 to 1977 and as a drill in-
structor in the United States Army from 1988
to 1998. After his long tenure of service to our
country, Hayes earned his GED and a Bach-
elor of Science degree from Medaille College.
He worked as an aircraft mechanic and as a
correctional officer at the Erie County Deten-
tion Center. He now resides in Cheektowaga
with his wife of 25 years and has nine children
and fourteen grandchildren, some of whom
have continued his family’s legacy of military
service. Sergeant Hayes remains active in
local and national veteran communities, in-
cluding designing an original military jewelry
line, serving as a greeter at a veteran clinic in
Batavia, and working as a docent right here at
the Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military
Park. We recently met Roland at a Buffalo
Naval Park event and were inspired by his
service and story.
Many Vietnam Veterans returned home with
little fanfare, including Roland Hayes, who has
never received the recognition fitting of a sol-
dier who served so valiantly and sacrificed so
much. It has been our honor to share his story
and pay tribute to his service, on behalf of a
grateful nation. His story is one of resilience,
breaking barriers, and beating the odds.
I ask all members to join me in remem-
bering all the great sacrifices made by those
who serve.

IN HONOR OF THE BICENTENNIAL
OF THE CRAWFORD PATH
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 6, 2019
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the bicentennial of the Crawford
Path, the oldest continuously maintained hik-
ing trail in the United States. For two cen-
turies, the Crawford Path has opened New
Hampshire’s White Mountains to adventure-
seekers and nature lovers of all backgrounds
and abilities.
Originally built in 1819 by Ethan Allen
Crawford and his father, Abel, the Crawford
Path is one of America’s most popular rec-
reational trails. Following a mountainous
ridgeline across miles of open alpine environ-
ment, the trail affords impressive views of the
peaks and valleys of the White Mountains.
The trail’s convergence with the famed Appa-
lachian Trail and its conclusion at the summit
of Mt. Washington, the tallest peak in the
Northeastern U.S., make it an attraction for
experienced and recreational hikers alike.
While the trail’s popularity affords many visi-
tors the chance to enjoy the natural beauty of
the Granite State, its frequent use has unfortu-
nately caused significant degradation of the
beloved trail. Maintaining such a well-trodden
path over such a long time is no small task.
I am proud of the White Mountain Region’s
local legacy of over 100 years of active trail
maintenance, with critical leadership from
stakeholders such as the U.S. Forest Service
and the Appalachian Mountain Club.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to
commemorate the Crawford Path’s bicenten-
nial and thank all those who have maintained
it for their service to our community. I thank
them for all that they do to make the Granite
State such a wonderful place, to work, live,
and play. Let us celebrate this exciting anni-
versary by committing ourselves to ensuring
that Crawford Path remains a jewel of the
White Mountains for another 200 years.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF CARL EUGENE PORTER, SR.
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND
OF LOUISIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 6, 2019
Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor the life and legacy of Carl Eugene Por-
ter, Sr. of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. An Army
veteran and hall of fame athletic coach, he
passed away on the evening of Wednesday,
July 24, 2019 at the age of 88. He was well
known to many as ‘‘Coach Porter’’.
One of four children, Coach Porter was born
on February 10, 1931 in Columbia, Missouri
before moving to Baton Rouge to attend
Southern University and Agricultural and Me-
chanical College, where he earned his bach-
elor’s degree in Physical Education. After
graduating, he was commissioned as a Sec-
ond Lieutenant in the United States Army and
served four years. He married his college
sweetheart, Ivory Hawkins, on December 30,
1954.
After his service in the Army, Coach Porter
began a career in education. His career began
at Scotlandville Junior High School, where he
led the Athletic Department to many cham-
pionships over a nineteen-year period. In
1976, Coach Porter transitioned to Southern
University Laboratory School as the Athletic
Director where the Fighting Kittens earned
many State Championships during his twelve-
year tenure. With a record of 129–25 under
his watch, many of his players went on to
have successful collegiate and professional
sports careers. Coach Porter was also well
known for placing an emphasis of academics
for the athletes under his tutelage.
Coach Porter’s thirty-one-year coaching ca-
reer led him to be inducted in the Louisiana
High School Sports Hall of Fame in 1999. He
also remained an active community and civic
leader through his contributions to the
NAACP, Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Incor-
porated, Kiwanis, the Fisherman’s Club, and
the Anna T. Jordan Recreation Center.
Coach Porter was widely known for his love
of family, friends, church, music, and human-
ity, and many regarded him as a local icon. As
a mentor, advocate, leader, and friend, Coach
Porter left an indelible impact on all those
whose lives he touched. His legacy of dedica-
tion and service to the Scotlandville commu-
nity will be remembered now and many years
to come. Coach Porter is survived by his wife,
Ivory Hawkins Porter, his children, Carl, Jr.,
Tracy, Rudy, Rodney, and Lonzella, as well as
his seven grandchildren and three great-
grandchildren.
Madam Speaker, I celebrate the life and
legacy of Carl Eugene Porter, Sr.
PERSECUTION OF FALUN GONG
PRACTITIONERS IN CHINA
HON. ZOE LOFGREN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 6, 2019
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, twenty
years ago, in July of 1999, it was widely re-
ported that the Chinese government began the
persecution of Falun Gong practitioners. Re-
ports of the Chinese government’s human
rights abuses against this group have contin-
ued during the last two decades.
Human rights, including freedom of expres-
sion and freedom of religion, should be uni-
versal. Members of Congress must work to
promote tolerance and basic human freedoms
worldwide.

RECOGNIZING JOSEPH ALEXANDER
HON. ERIC SWALWELL
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 6, 2019
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise to recognize United States Ma-
rine Corps Private First Class (PFC) Joseph
Alexander on the occasion of his receiving the
Congressional Gold Medal issued to the
Montford Point Marines. The approximately
20,000 Montford Point Marines were the first
African Americans to enlist in the United
States Marine Corps after an executive order
issued by President Franklin Roosevelt in
June 1941 took the first steps to end racial
discrimination in employment with federal gov-
ernment agencies.
Originally from New Orleans, Louisiana, Jo-
seph’s personal service began when he was
just 19 years old in June 1943. He went
through boot camp at Montford Point, North
Carolina, as the nearby Camp Lejeune was
off-limits if you were not being escorted by a
white Marine. When his training was complete,
Joseph shipped out to fight in the Pacific the-
ater where he participated in the effort to push
Japanese forces out of the Marshall Islands.
Like many veterans, Joseph chose not to
speak much about his experience during the
war. He returned home, got married, raised
five children, and settled in Hayward in 1972.
Only recently, in an effort to get him con-
nected with benefits through the Veterans Ad-
ministration, did the family find documentation
that connected Joseph to the Montford Point
Marines.
Our community has rallied together to honor
Joseph, who will be 95 years old in Sep-
tember. He recently received his own copy of
the Congressional Gold Medal from the Na-
tional Montford Point Marine Association at a
ceremony hosted by American Legion Hay-
ward Post 870 and American Veterans Post
911 at the Hayward Veterans Memorial Build-
ing.
Joseph, thank you for your service. Not only
for your bravery in war, but also for your con-
tribution to breaking down the barriers that
prevented all people from fighting for our
country and the freedom of its people.

HONORING DR. DANIEL P. KING
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 6, 2019
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor Dr. Daniel P. King, an ed-
ucator, innovator, and leader.
For the past 12 years, Dr. King served as
superintendent of the Pharr-San Juan-Alamo
Independent School District (PSJA ISD), work-
ing tirelessly to ensure PSJA ISD provides its
students with the resources necessary to suc-
ceed. He announced his plans to retire from
his position this past fall, and I find it only fit-
ting to take this time on the House floor to
honor a man that has done so much for South
Texas. Dr. King spent 42 years in public edu-
cation, 20 of those years as superintendent at
two school districts in the Rio Grande Valley.
During Dr. King’s tenure, he introduced pro-
grams and procedures that have had lasting
positive effects on the students and the PSJA
community as a whole. He was one of the first
to start an Early College High School Program
in South Texas that provides thousands of stu-
dents concurrent and dual enrollment opportu-
nities, college and career connected path-
ways, and the opportunity to graduate with
college credentials up to an associate’s de-
gree while still enrolled in high school.
Dr. King demonstrated his commitment to
replacing outdated bilingual education models
with dual language or dual immersion pro-
grams to equip students for a brighter future.
His actions afforded students the opportunity
to graduate from high school ready for higher
education, putting PSJA on the course to be-
come a national leader in producing college
ready, academically bi-literate, high school
graduates. Thanks to Dr. King, our students
are more prepared and able to be successful
and productive members of society.
Madam Speaker, Dr. Daniel P. King has
worked diligently to give countless students
the tools they need to succeed. He is a pillar
of our community and an example to us all. It
is an honor to represent a selfless and com-
mitted individuals like him. Dr. King has for-
ever changed and strengthened the foundation
of education in South Texas. I wish Daniel P.
King and his family all the best in their future
endeavors and thank you for this time.

HONORING RESIDENTS OF THE
VILLAGE OF LA GRANGE, ILLI-
NOIS ON THEIR 140TH ANNIVER-
SARY AS A VILLAGE
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 6, 2019
Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the residents of La Grange, Illinois as
the village celebrates its 140th anniversary.
La Grange enjoys a long and vibrant history
beginning in the early 19th century. The area,
originally consisting of prairie land, was first
settled as a result of land grants offered by
President Martin Van Buren. One of the early
residents was Franklin D. Cossitt. After leaving
Tennessee, Mr. Cossitt moved to Chicago and
started the largest wholesale grocery business
in the area. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871
destroyed Mr. Cossitt’s business and drove
people westward to the suburbs.
Mr. Cossitt’s dream for constructing a com-
munity began when he bought and developed
600 acres of land that was later incorporated
as the village of La Grange in 1879. In 1873,
Mr. Cossitt quickly began laying out streets
and building homes. By 1890, La Grange had
already seen tremendous growth and now in-
cluded twenty-eight retail businesses, a new
high school, churches, a newspaper, paved
roads, and a railroad station. The Village of La
Grange quickly became known as the largest
town between Chicago and Aurora.
The Village of La Grange has continued to
develop and today is home to more than 130
businesses and 15,550 residents. Although La
Grange has come a long way, it is still a safe
and quiet place to live. The La Grange historic
district is home to many of the original build-
ings built by Mr. Cossitt in the 1870’s. Be-
cause of the quality of the architecture and the
historic significance, the Village of La Grange
historic district was placed on the National
Register of Historic Places in 1979.
I am proud to represent the residents of La
Grange and I will gather with them on the Vil-
lage Hall lawn on August 8th to celebrate the
village’s anniversary. I ask you to join me in
honoring the residents of La Grange, Illinois,
on their 140th anniversary as a village. May
they enjoy this celebration and may the Village
continue to thrive as a close-knit community.

INTRODUCTION OF THE ROCK
CREEK NATIONAL PARK ACT
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 6, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I
rise to introduce a bill to redesignate the Na-
tional Park Service-owned Rock Creek Park,
in the District of Columbia, as ‘‘Rock Creek
National Park.’’ Renaming this park will high-
light its significance to the nation, including
visitors to the nation’s capital, and will help get
much-needed funding for the park’s inviting
trails, waterways and other unique features.
No additional federal funds will be required.
Rock Creek Park is already a national park,
established by Congress in 1890 ‘‘for the ben-
efit and enjoyment of the people of the United
States,’’ and is the oldest urban park and the
third federal park ever created, after Yellow-
stone and Sequoia. Rock Creek Park was de-
signed to preserve animals, timber, forestry
and other interests in the park, and to ensure
that its natural state is maintained as much as
possible, for all American people, not just for
D.C. residents.
Over time, several structures have been es-
tablished or donated to further preserve Rock
Creek Park. In 1892, for example, the federal
government acquired Peirce Mill in Rock
Creek Park, one of the mills used by local
farmers during the 18th, 19th and 20th cen-
turies. In 1950, the Old Stone House, located
at 3051 M Street NW, with its great pre-Revo-
lutionary War architecture, was acquired by
the park. The building was restored, and pro-
grams explain the house’s rich history from
the colonial period to the present day. The
Fort Circle Parks were also acquired to inter-
pret and preserve the Civil War Defenses of
Washington, which created a ring of protection
for the nation’s capital during the Civil War.
Today, Rock Creek Park offers residents of
the District of Columbia, Maryland and North-
ern Virginia, as well as thousands of visitors,
an escape from our increasingly urban envi-
ronment. Residents and tourists alike enjoy
many activities in the park’s 2,000 acres, in-
cluding hiking and biking on the historical
trails, horseback riding, picnicking, tennis and
other recreational activities in some of the
open fields. Our residents have expressed
their appreciation by volunteering to clean up
and maintain the trails and waterways.
Redesignating Rock Creek Park as Rock
Creek National Park will help recognize the
national status of the park and protect and re-
vitalize this remarkable resource in our na-
tion’s capital.
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this
legislation.

Currently celebrating its 36th Anniversary,
the National Night Out (NNO) is a unique
crime and drug prevention event sponsored by
the National Association of Town Watch
(NATW). Founded in 1984, it has grown from
a small idea to a national event celebrated by
civilians and law enforcement agencies
throughout the country. With over 38 million
‘‘neighbors’’ and 16 thousand communities
participating, it provides a unique opportunity
for civilians to learn more about the law en-
forcement in their community.
Throughout its history, it has worked to fos-
ter positive community relationships between
civilians and law enforcement. It actively en-
gages participants in fun, informational activi-
ties that heighten awareness of law enforce-
ment efforts in crime and drug prevention,

Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it’s my
honor today to recognize the visit of the Re-
membering Our Fallen memorial in Menom-
inee, Michigan.
First created in 2010, Remembering Our
Fallen is a photographic war memorial hon-
oring those who have made the ultimate sac-
rifice in defense of our nation following the
September 11th attacks. Unlike other brick
and marble memorials, Remembering Our
Fallen was designed to travel throughout the
country and features military and personal
photos of those who we have lost. Its efforts
ensure that the men and women who have
died in service will forever be remembered by
Americans everywhere.
Efforts to host the Remembering Our Fallen
memorial in Michigan’s First District were
spearheaded by the Menominee Disabled
American Veterans chapter. The memorial will
be set up at the Veterans Memorial Park in
Menominee from August 23rd through the
26th.
We owe the men and women featured in
the Remembering Our Fallen memorial a debt
which can never be repaid. By coming to-
gether to honor those who stood up to defend
and to serve, the people of Michigan’s First
District can ensure that their sacrifice is never
forgotten.
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in
honoring the lives of those who have made
the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our free-
dom as the Upper Peninsula hosts the Re-
membering Our Fallen memorial.

COMMEMORATING THE SEVENTY-
FIFTH ANNUAL GERRY RODEO
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 6, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
commemorate the seventy-fifth annual Gerry
Rodeo.
The village of Gerry in western New York is
the proud home of the oldest consecutive
rodeo east of the Mississippi. Each year ap-
proximately seven thousand fans, and two
hundred and fifty cowboys and cowgirls travel
to Gerry, NY to enjoy the competition. For four
days the quiet village of Gerry becomes ‘‘The
Rodeo Capital of the East’’.
The Gerry Rodeo began in 1945, when a
former working cowboy named Jack Cox
moved from the West to Gerry and suggested
a rodeo as a way of fundraising for the newly
formed fire department. In seventy days fire
department members and volunteers trans-
formed four acres of swampland into an arena
and parking lot, borrowing bleachers from
local schools and renting portable lights.
From the very beginning, the Gerry Fire De-
partment wanted to ensure their rodeo was a
top-notch competition and for that reason, they
have always ensured their rodeo is sanctioned
by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys’ Associa-
tion. Today, the competition consists of the
same competitive events as the first Rodeo
seventy-five years ago: bareback bronc riding,
tie-down roping, saddle bronc riding, bull
riding, steer wrestling, team roping, and cow-
girls’ barrel racing.
Seventy-five years of community tradition is
certainly a cause for celebration. I congratu-
late the Gerry Rodeo on this impressive mile-
stone and look forward to many more rodeos
in the years to come.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
celebrate the seventy-fifth annual Gerry
Rodeo.

RECOGNIZING THE 173RD QUAR-
TERMASTER SERVICE COMPANY
HON. TRENT KELLY
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 6, 2019
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize the military service of
the 173rd Quartermaster Service Company of
the United States Army.
On August 9, 2019, the 173rd Quarter-
master Service Company is celebrating the
50th anniversary of their safe return from Viet-
nam in Greenwood, MS. These brave vet-
erans arrived in Da Nang, Vietnam on Sep-
tember 30, 1968. The unit was headquartered
both at the Gia Le Combat Base and the Phu
Bai military complex. During their tour, the unit
received campaign participation credits for
Vietnam Counteroffensive Phase V; Vietnam
Counteroffensive Phase VI; TET 69 Counter-
offensive; and Vietnam Summer-Fall 69. On
August 5, 1969, the 173rd Quartermaster
Service Company returned home to the United
States.
I thank these veterans for their service to
our great nation and the state of Mississippi.

RECOGNIZING MR. AND MRS. JOHN
BRADY
HON. BRYAN STEIL
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 6, 2019
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the 52nd wedding anniversary of
Mr. and Mrs. John Brady of Lake Geneva.
John and Toni are visiting Washington, D.C. to
celebrate this special occasion. John is a re-
tired U.S. Army Vietnam Veteran.
Toni and John’s life long commitment to
each other is admirable. As John and Toni
celebrate their 52nd anniversary, may their
commitment grow even stronger; as they con-
tinue to love and honor one another for years
to come.
As John’s love for his wife is evident, so is
his love of country. On behalf of the U.S.
House of Representatives, I thank John for his
service to our country. John, Toni, and their
family made many sacrifices for our freedoms.
We owe them a debt of gratitude for their self-
lessness.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the
U.S. House of Representatives to join me in
congratulating John and Toni on their anniver-
sary and wish them nothing but the best.

RECOGNIZING SMOKEY BEAR’S
75TH BIRTHDAY
HON. JACK BERGMAN
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 6, 2019
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it’s my
honor to recognize the 75th birthday of Smok-
ey Bear. Through his dedication to responsible
outdoor recreation, public safety, and environ-
mental conservation, Smokey has become an
indispensable part of our nation.
The state of Michigan is home to some of
the most pristine forests in the country—at-
tracting visitors from around the world and
providing Michiganders with a quality of life
that is second to none. However, something
as simple as a cigarette butt or unattended
campfire could spark a disastrous fire in the
right conditions, making our precious lands
susceptible to unimaginable damage. Since
1942, the U.S. Forest Service has used Smok-
ey Bear, the beloved hat-clad grizzly, to edu-
cate Americans on the importance of respon-
sible fire practices.
With our ongoing struggle against dev-
astating wildfires, Smokey’s mission is as im-
portant today as it has ever been. Between
the Hiawatha, Ottawa, and Huron-Manistee
National Forests, Michigan’s First District is
home to nearly three million acres of National
Forests. We in Northern Michigan and the
Upper Peninsula understand the importance of
safe and responsible outdoor recreation.
Smokey Bear continues to play a critical role
in our efforts to promote access to the out-
doors while protecting the health and beauty
of these natural treasures. I’m grateful for
Smokey Bear’s and the U.S. Forest Service’s
75 years of advocacy and work to ensure fu-
ture generations can enjoy the same natural
beauty we so deeply treasure. Smokey’s birth-
day will be celebrated on August 9th at Straits
State Park in St. Ignace, overlooking the
Straits of Mackinac and the Mighty Mac
bridge.
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to celebrate
Smokey Bear’s 75 years of education, public
safety, and conservation. On behalf of my
constituents, I wish him and the U.S. Forest
Service all the best in their future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING J.V. FLUEHR
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK

Tuesday, August 6, 2019
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I
would like to recognize J.V. Fluehr, an out-
standing citizen from Doylestown, Pennsyl-
vania, who recently attained the rank of Eagle
Scout.
J.V. is committed to service to our commu-
nity. For his Eagle Scout project, Jack beau-
tified the property of the nonprofit organization
Shamrock Reins. J.V. is dedicated to ensuring
our veterans are properly honored upon their
return home.
On behalf of all residents of the First Con-
gressional District, I congratulate J.V. on his
achievement.

RECOGNIZING ROBERT E. COLTER
AND CATHERINE STROMDAHL
COLTER
HON. MIKE BOST
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 6, 2019
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize Robert E. Colter and Catherine
Stromdahl Colter of East Alton, Illinois for
celebrating their 102nd and 100th birthdays,
respectively. Robert, born on August 3, 1917
in Titusville, Pennsylvania and Catherine, born
on July 27, 1919, were married in Catherine’s
hometown of Warren, Pennsylvania on March
21, 1942. This year, Robert and Catherine
also celebrated their seventy-seventh wedding
anniversary.
Robert and Catherine moved to East Alton,
Illinois in 1962, where they continue to reside
in the same home today. When they are not
spending time with their children and many
grandchildren, Robert and Catherine dedicate
their time giving back to their community. As
members of East Alton First United Methodist
Church for over 50 years, the Colters have
made a lasting impact on countless people.
Their commitment to each other and the bet-
terment of their community is truly inspiring.
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring
Mr. Robert E. Colter and Mrs. Catherine
Stromdahl Colter for their many years together
and their contributions to Southern Illinois.

HONORING SERGEANT FIRST
CLASS ELLIOTT J. ROBBINS
HON. DOUG LAMBORN
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 6, 2019
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, Sergeant
First Class (SFC) Elliott J. Robbins died on
June 30, 2019, in Helmand Province, Afghani-
stan, while conducting operations in support of
Operation Freedom’s Sentinel. SFC Robbins
was born in San Diego, California on August
18, 1987, and spent most of his life in North
Ogden, Utah. He was 31 years of age.
SFC Robbins joined the Army in June 2006,
and after years of training completed the Spe-
cial Forces Qualification course in 2016 and
was assigned to Fort Carson, Colorado. SFC
Robbins was part of a unique brand of our na-
tion’s elite warrior class called the Green Be-
rets. The Green Beret motto is ‘‘De Oppresso
Liber’’—to free the oppressed. He was as-
signed as a Medical Sergeant with the 2nd
Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group (Air-
borne). Robbins deployed three times in sup-
port of the United States: first to Iraq in 2007,
then to Afghanistan in 2017 and again in Jan-
uary 2019. His third and last tour would have
been over only three weeks after Robbins
passed away.
SFC Robbins’ decorations and awards are
too numerous to list here, but include: the
Army Commendation Medal with Combat De-
vice and one Oak Leaf Cluster, the National
Defense Service Medal, the Afghanistan Cam-
paign Medal with Campaign Star, the Expert
Infantryman Badge, the Military Freefall Para-
chutist Badge, and the Parachutist Badge, to
name a few.
SFC Robbins’ service epitomized the best of
the American soul: courageous and selfless.
He was buried with full military honors on July
19, 2019. Our hearts go out to his family and
friends, especially the bereaved wife and in-
fant son of this great patriot.

TRIBUTE TO JOHN WIELAND
HON. ROB WOODALL
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 6, 2019
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I would
like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to a
fantastic member of the metro Atlanta commu-
nity, Mr. John Wieland, who founded John
Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods in 1970.
In his first year as a home builder, working out
of his Volkswagen, he built 20 homes! Fast
forward nearly 50 years and more than 30,000
satisfied homeowners later, he has estab-
lished himself as one of the Southeast’s lead-
ing builders of semi-custom homes.
Mr. Wieland is a past president of both the
Greater Atlanta Home Builders Association
and the Home Builders Association of Geor-
gia, and he is a Senior Life Director of the Na-
tional Association of Home Builders. In 1991,
Mr. Wieland was awarded the Greater Atlanta
Home Builders Association’s Lewis Cenker
Award for lifetime achievement and is a mem-
ber of the Home Builders Association of Geor-
gia’s Hall of Fame.
And the accolades don’t stop there. Mr.
Wieland has been named National Builder of
the Year by Professional Builder Magazine,
America’s Best Builder in 2005 by Builder
Magazine, and his company won J.D. Power
and Associates award for Highest Ranked
Quality Among New Home Builders in Atlanta
for three years running.
In addition to his success in the home build-
ing industry, Mr. Wieland has proven time and
again his success as a member of our com-
munity through his stewardship of others. He
served as the Chairman of the Federal Re-
serve Bank of Atlanta and is a past Chair of
the Advisory Council for Emory University’s
Center for Ethics. He also served as the Di-
rector of the High Museum of Art for three
years beginning in 1998.
Mr. Wieland is a graduate of both Amherst
College and the Harvard Business School,
and he received an honorary Doctorate of Hu-
mane Letters from Amherst College. Addition-
ally, he is an elder in the Presbyterian Church
U.S.A., where he ministers to our community
every day.
On behalf of all those touched by John’s
dedication and service, I want to say thank
you, and I wish him the best of luck in the fu-
ture.

CELEBRATING THE 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF FORT ONTARIO EMER-
GENCY REFUGEE SHELTER
HON. JOHN KATKO
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 6, 2019
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the 75th anniversary of the Fort On-
tario Emergency Refugee Shelter located in
Oswego, New York. Fort Ontario holds histor-
ical significance as the only shelter for Euro-
pean Holocaust victims in the United States
during World War II. At the time, the Fort was
America’s first exposure to the damaging ex-
tent of the Holocaust and today serves as an
important reminder of our nation’s responsi-
bility to defend the freedoms and rights of all
individuals.
On July 17, 1944, 982 European refugees
from 18 different countries boarded the USNS
Henry Gibbons in Naples, Italy to cross the At-
lantic Ocean as they fled Nazi persecution.
The refugees arrived at the Fort Ontario Emer-
gency Refugee Shelter on August 5 following
the 19-day journey, which marked the begin-
ning of their ten month stay at the fort.
Fort Ontario, which was also known as Safe
Haven, shielded the refugees from violent per-
secution and tyranny in Europe. The shelter
was closed in June 1945 and many refugees
became American citizens, while some re-
turned to Europe. Although it was open for
less than a year, the Fort Ontario Emergency
Refugee Shelter played a critical role in saving
the lives of the 982 refugees who resided in
the fort.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the
House to join me in celebrating Fort Ontario
Emergency Refugee Shelter’s 75th anniver-
sary. Since serving as a shelter for European
refugees, Fort Ontario has been recognized as
a significant site by the U.S. National Register
of Historic Places. Thousands of visitors travel
to Fort Ontario each year, and they are re-
minded of the Holocaust victims who took ref-
uge there and America’s role in protecting
these vulnerable individuals.

CONGRATULATING BERNARD J.
STANAWAY, JR. FOR BEING
NAMED 2019 U.P. VETERAN OF
THE YEAR
HON. JACK BERGMAN
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 6, 2019
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it’s my
honor to recognize Bernard J. Stanaway, Jr.,
for being named the 2019 U.P. Veteran of the
Year. Through his dedicated service, excep-
tional leadership, and steadfast devotion to his
community, Bernard has become an indispen-
sable part of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
The U.P. Veteran of the Year is chosen an-
nually by a selection committee consisting of
past commanders of various service organiza-
tions throughout the peninsula. It is given to
recognize Yooper Veterans who go above and
beyond in their service to their local commu-
nities and fellow Veterans. None are more de-
serving of this honor than Bernard. During his
military career, Bernard served as a Corporal
in the United States Marine Corps, where he
was decorated with the Korean Defense Serv-
ice Medal, National Defense Service Medal,
SCR Service Deployment Medal, and Good
Conduct Medal. His devotion to the people of
his country and community has not wavered
since he returned from military service.
It is impossible to fully list all the ways in
which Bernard works to better the lives of U.P.
Veterans. He is an active member and has
served in a variety of leadership positions at
the American Legion, AMVETs, DAV, VFW
and the Paralyzed Veterans of America. Addi-
tionally, Bernard serves Veterans as the Mar-
quette County Trust Fund Agent, aids Vet-
erans at the D.J. Jacobetti Home on outings at
AMVET picnics, visits homebound Veterans,
transports Veterans to appointments to Iron
Mountain with DAV, attends Veteran funerals,
plows snow for homebound Veterans, and
helps Veterans in need with service claims
and medical bills. Bernard has devoted dec-
ades to the people of Michigan, and his tire-
less efforts have directly improved the lives of
thousands of U.P. Veterans.
Outside of his work with Veterans organiza-
tions, Bernard is active with the Boy Scouts of
America, where he has served Troop 372 as
the Charter Organization Representative, As-
sistant Scout Master, Den Leader, and Troop
Committee member. He is also an active
member of the NRA, Masons, Knights Tem-
plars, Project Evergreen, and No Barriers. As
a servicemember, a Veteran, a volunteer, and
a Yooper, Bernard consistently puts the needs
of others before his own. He will be honored
as the 2019 Upper Peninsula Veteran of the
Year at a ceremony during the U.P. State Fair
in Escanaba on August 15th.
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to congratu-
late Bernard J. Stanaway, Jr., for his decades
of service to fellow Michigan Veterans, and for
being named the 2019 Upper Peninsula Vet-
eran of the Year. Michiganders can take great
pride in knowing the First District is home to
such a selfless and devoted individual. On be-
half of my constituents, I wish Bernard all the
best in his future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING SNOHOMISH CON-
SERVATION DISTRICT MANAGER
MONTE MARTI FOR 20 YEARS OF
DEDICATION TO CONSERVATION
IN SNOHOMISH COUNTY ON THE
OCCASION OF HIS RETIREMENT
HON. SUZAN K. DelBENE
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 6, 2019
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize Monte Marti, the district manager at
the Snohomish Conservation District and val-
ued member of our community, in honor of his
retirement on August 9th, 2019. Mr. Marti has
a long history of active participation in the bet-
terment and support of Snohomish County in
Washington state. Raised on a farm in the Co-
lumbia Basin in Eastern Washington, Mr.
Marti’s interest in agriculture and our environ-
ment began early in his life. He pursued this
path academically, achieving a Master’s de-
gree in Agriculture Economics with an empha-
sis on natural resources from Washington
State University. That was certainly not the
end of Mr. Marti’s work in conservation. In
1983, Mr. Marti began volunteering at the
Snohomish Conservation District, becoming a
volunteer board member. Almost a decade
later, he took on another volunteer position as
secretary-treasurer for the Washington Asso-
ciation of Conservation Districts. His illustrious
career continued as he served on the WACD
Plant Material Center Advisory Board, and fi-
nally as the district manager at Washington’s
own Snohomish Conservation District. I cannot
fully express how much his dedication to our
state and our community means to all who
have the pleasure of meeting him.
For the past 25 years, Mr. Marti has never
ceased his conservation efforts. As district
manager he worked tirelessly to build strong
relationships between with environmental
groups and his reputation as a collaborator is
well deserved. Thanks to Mr. Marti’s interest in
agriculture and natural resources, he brought
passion to his work that will not be forgotten,
and will be greatly missed. Thank you, Mr.
Marti, for your unwavering love of our state,
our region, and the importance of conserva-
tion.

Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize and celebrate the life of Jim
Monken, a loving father, football coach, and
mentor who helped young men in East St.
Louis become champions on and off the grid-
iron.
Youth coaches serve not only to help play-
ers win games, but to teach them responsi-
bility and accountability as they grow into men.
Coach Monken will be remembered by those
who played under him as a father figure who
did everything in his power to ensure they
succeeded in life. If you played for his team,
you were a member of his family for life. In
fact, before his recent passing, Coach Monken
was visited by many of his former players, a
testament to his life-long impact on those who
played for him.
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring
Coach Jim Monken, one of the most success-
ful youth football coaches in Illinois history and
an even better human being.
