NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

f
ABORTION AND INFANTICIDE ARE
NOT WOMEN’S HEALTHCARE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, abortion and infanticide are
not examples of women’s healthcare.
Abortion advocates used to say they
wanted abortion to be safe, legal, and
rare. Today, they want abortion to be
free, casual, and for newborns.
It is distressing to see the new levels
of disregard they hold for new human
lives and how their language has fos-
tered such numbness to the moral evil
of abortion that there is now space in
society to openly promote infanticide.
The Reproductive Healthcare Act,
RHA, law being celebrated by pro-abor-
tion activists in New York and Vir-
ginia’s Repeal Act bill, which is sup-
ported by pro-abortion activists, legis-
lators, and Governor Northam, are hor-
rifying indicators of that attitude and
the spreading culture of death.
This time, pro-abortionists have gone
farther than ever before, by their own
admission. Their actions fly in the face
of the limits of abortion that most
Americans support and lay bare the ex-
treme agenda of the pro-abortion
movement. Not only are they bent on
the systematic removal of any protec-
tions for the unborn that exist in law,
now they admit that they support in-
fanticide.
The sponsor of Virginia’s bill said
that a baby could be ‘‘aborted,’’ i.e.,
murdered, as he or she is being born.
This should be a moment for reflection
on the reality of the atrocities being
committed in the name of so-called
women’s healthcare.
These extreme and disgusting ad-
vances by abortion advocates expose
the reality of our culture’s view of
human dignity writ large. Society
can’t allow these actions to go unchal-
lenged and still believe that the cul-
ture supports human dignity.
With their language, abortion advo-
cates have been successful at dehuman-
izing the unborn and devaluing human
life itself. The Repeal Act would fur-
ther ensure that the life of a child re-
mains unseen by repealing ultrasound
requirements and the State’s 24-hour
waiting period before an abortion. It is
as though society’s ‘‘ignorance is bliss’’
mentality is a requisite for abortion
advocates’ agenda to strip unborn life
of protection.
Thanks to the tragic decision of Roe
v. Wade, abortion can be performed in
the U.S. in all 9 months of pregnancy
for any reason related to a mother’s
health. The RHA preserves and expands
Roe v. Wade’s guarantees of access to
abortion.
In New York, an abortionist no
longer need be a licensed physician,
and if an abortion is not successful and
the child is born alive, the law has an
absolutely barbaric provision that en-
sures the child still dies.
The RHA repeals section 4164 of New
York’s public health law. That section
required abortions after 12 weeks of
pregnancy be performed in a hospital
and that abortions performed after 20
weeks have a separate physician ready
to provide medical care for any infant
born alive during the procedure.
This repealed section also protected
children born after a botched abortion
and required records to be kept of the
infant’s medical treatment. Without
section 4164, infants who survive in an
attempt to kill them in the womb have
no legal right to life and could be de-
nied the care they need to live.
It is clear that the value of life has
eroded in our culture. Without a soci-
ety that questions ‘‘what are the rights
of the unborn?’’ New York and Virginia
legislators can use their power to
eliminate the right to life and promote
the idea that life is dispensable, even in
the case where a child is viable and the
mother’s life is not in danger.
Nothing warrants the evil of infan-
ticide, yet calling abortion healthcare
has become a widespread and accept-
able justification for a woman to
choose abortion over life. Meanwhile,
supporting unborn life has come to
mean being against women’s choices.
As a woman and proud pro-lifer, I re-
ject this deceptive language and the
false narrative it perpetuates. I also
encourage proponents of the New York
and Virginia legislation to ask whether
these policies reflect a society where
women are truly valued or where un-
wanted babies are indefensible.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1354 February 5, 2019
Finally, in a culture where aborted
babies are collateral damage in so-
called women’s healthcare, we should
all fear that, following unborn children
and newborns, there will soon be new
targets for disposal.
f
PROTECT THE INNOCENT
CHILDREN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL) for 5 minutes.
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, as an
obstetrician, I have delivered thou-
sands of babies and helped moms
through pregnancies for 25 years.
I stand before the House today dis-
gusted by the murderous, barbarous
legislation pushed by Democrats in
New York legalizing abortions for any
reason, all the way until the due date
of the baby. This extremist antilife
abortion measure is literally nause-
ating to me.
How sad it is that we live in a time
when extremists are legalizing the
murder of innocent, defenseless chil-
dren. The legalization of these late-
term procedures that amount to infan-
ticide are the worst thing I have heard
in my entire professional lifetime.
I call on my obstetricians and other
physicians who deliver babies. I call on
the American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists and all physician as-
sociations to openly denounce and
refuse these murderous procedures.
Legal or not, this is morally reprehen-
sible.
As a father, a grandfather, a physi-
cian, and a human being who loves peo-
ple, I cannot sit here in good con-
science while this is going on, regard-
less of it being on a State level. I will
do everything in my power to combat
this position from spreading and pro-
tect these innocent children.
f
THE IMPACT OF ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION ON FAMILIES
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. LAMALFA) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, yet an-
other instance of illegal immigration
impacting real families has occurred in
the western States, Nevada and Cali-
fornia.
I thank President Trump and First
Lady Melania Trump for honoring
three people from my district tonight
as guests for the State of the Union
Address.
Sadly, Debra Bissell, Heather Arm-
strong, and Madison Armstrong will be
here as guests because of the tragedy
that happened in their life. They are
the daughter, granddaughter, and
great-granddaughter of Gerald and
Sharon David, who were murdered in
their home in Reno, Nevada, just this
last month.
The murderer? An illegal immigrant
from El Salvador who had been living
in Carson City for over a year. No mo-
tive has been released, but, then, does
the motive really matter to this fam-
ily, to yet another loss of life due to il-
legal immigration and the sieve we
have of a border in this country?
But Gerald and Sharon were two of
four people who this man, whose name
I will not mention, shot dead in their
homes over the course of a week. The
other two victims were Connie Koontz
and Sophia Renken, from Reno, Ne-
vada.
These brutal murders will have a tre-
mendous impact on the families of
each of these victims, including Debra,
Heather, and Madison, whom we will
meet tonight.
When we talk about border security,
when the President speaks about it to-
night, these three faces should serve as
a reminder of the real-life con-
sequences of our open border policy
that this country seems to have.
This is not just a talking point or po-
litical football to be tossed around.
Real people are being hurt—the ones
left behind—lives are being ruined, as
well as the lives being taken, time
after time, because the Congress can’t
get its act together to get a bipartisan
solution for border security, for a bor-
der barrier, and a combination of
things that it will take to effectively
run the border, to patrol our border,
and to give our personnel down there
all the tools they need to do it effec-
tively, safely for the American citizens
and safely for themselves.
It doesn’t matter if you want to call
it a wall, a fence, a physical barrier, or
anything else. It is long past time to do
something about the crime, violence,
drugs, and human trafficking.
The human trafficking, we don’t talk
about that enough, what is really hap-
pening to the people who are being
brought across who do want to come
seek something better in America but
are subject to the coyotes who take ad-
vantage of them, extracting dollars
from them and unspeakable things
from the women whom they bring
across the border and the kids. It is
long past time to do something about
all those subjects that are currently
moving fairly freely in our country.
For Debra, Heather, and Madison
from Redding, California, they rep-
resent three generations in their fam-
ily that has been devastated by the sta-
tus quo of our border situation.
I am grateful that President Trump
is shining a bright, unmistakable light
on this issue and the urgency with
which we must address it. Every single
day we do nothing is another day that
another family is being potentially
harmed in some way by the inaction
and inability on both sides of the aisle
to come together to get something ef-
fective done.
I wish it wasn’t under these cir-
cumstances that Debra, Heather, and
Madison will have to be here tonight.
Their grief must be immense. But to-
night, their story will be front and cen-
ter for all America to see. It is cer-
tainly no consolation, nothing to as-
suage the pain they must feel, but I
hope their presence might help spark
some positive change in this country
that is long overdue.
I thank the President and First Lady,
again, for inviting them. I thank
Debra, Heather, and Madison for their
courage in having to share this tragedy
and go through the pain in order to
help advance a cause of sovereign bor-
ders and safety for other American
citizens who will, hopefully, not have
to go through this.
I ask the American people to join us
in praying for Gerald and Sharon
David, for their family that will join us
here tonight, for other victims and
family members who have been taken
by the senseless killing, and to pray
that a solution happens so we don’t
have any more of this in this great
land.

Loving God, thank You for giving us

Mr. LAMALFA led the Pledge of Alle-

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
f
DEMOCRACY FOR VENEZUELA
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, the people of Venezuela have
taken to the streets to demand an end
to 20 years of dictatorship and repres-
sion. I am grateful that President Don-
ald Trump is supporting the demo-
cratic aspirations of the Venezuelan
people.
The people of Venezuela deserve to
prosper. They are fortunate to hold the
world’s largest supply of crude oil, but
decades of socialist corruption and
mismanagement, first under Hugo Cha-
vez and then Nicolas Maduro, have im-
poverished Venezuela.
Then came the sham 2018 Presi-
dential elections. That is why the Na-
tional Assembly President Juan
Guaido implemented their constitution
by declaring himself interim President
and called for new elections.
We must continue to support hope in
Venezuela. Free and fair elections must
be held. The people of Venezuela de-
serve freedom and democracy.
In conclusion, God bless our troops
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.
f
HONORING THE MEMORY OF JOHN
LEE
(Mr. MALINOWSKI asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker,
today I rise to honor the memory of
John Lee, a resident of New Jersey’s
Seventh Congressional District who
passed away on January 25 after wag-
ing a courageous battle with cancer.
Mr. Lee immigrated to America in
1987 and worked day and night to build
a better life for himself and his family.
In 2000, he became a citizen, and like
many immigrants, he understood the
meaning of civic duty and the impor-
tance of a single person’s vote better
than many of us whose families have
been here for generations.
So when he was faced with a cancer
diagnosis, his first thought was not to
sink into despair. He simply asked:
‘‘What’s next?’’
As his diagnosis progressed, Mr. Lee
began to understand the pressing need
for legislation to protect people with
preexisting conditions, and the ques-
tion of, ‘‘What’s next?’’ was answered.
He spent his remaining time fighting
to help make our healthcare system
more just and to make America, as he
put it, a Nation of us, not of me.
Today, I am truly honored to be
joined at the State of the Union by his
siblings. Mr. Speaker, John Lee has al-
ready helped to shape our under-
standing of what must be done to make
healthcare a human right for all Amer-
icans. May his legacy be that we have
finally done it.
f
HONORING DICK TRAMMEL
(Mr. WOMACK asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor the retirement of a pil-
lar of my community, an exemplary
businessman, dedicated public servant,
dear friend, and an all-around great
American, Dick Trammel of Rogers,
Arkansas.
Most know him as Mr. Northwest Ar-
kansas. No one I know of has loved,
served, and promoted northwest Ar-
kansas more than Dick Trammel.
A native of Pocahontas, Arkansas,
Dick was recruited to the northwest
part of our State by Walmart founder,
Sam Walton. Since moving to the area
in 1975, he has been the area’s most
avid cheerleader. Cheerleading came
natural for Dick, who was a University
of Arkansas cheerleader back in the
1950s.
Nothing of importance in our area
has happened in the last 40-plus years
that doesn’t have Dick Trammel’s fin-
gerprints on it. He was the only man to
lead the Arkansas State Highway Com-
mission for 4 years. He has been a
mainstay in Rotary International,
higher education, programs serving our
youth, Mercy Hospital Northwest Ar-
kansas, and dozens of other charitable
causes.
Dickey Ray, congratulations on a
terrific career and a life of serving your
fellow man.
f
CONGRATULATING ACTING
SECRETARY DAVID BERNHARDT
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Acting Sec-
retary David Bernhardt for being nomi-
nated to serve as the next Secretary of
the Department of the Interior.
President Trump announced that
news on Monday after Acting Sec-
retary Bernhardt has led the Depart-
ment in a temporary capacity since De-
cember. I applaud this decision by the
President. He has chosen a nominee
that brings a strong background of in-
dustry experience and expertise to the
table.
Under this administration, I have
worked with the Department of the In-
terior to improve stewardship of our
public’s lands, to increase water stor-
age, and improve forest management
policies in California, as well as the
West, and to help prevent more wildfire
damage.
I know that will continue under the
leadership of Secretary Bernhardt as it
has since he has led the Department. I
intend to invite him out to my district
in California to see firsthand the issues
that we face with our forests and pub-
lic lands, including the ongoing Camp
fire cleanup in Paradise, as well as the
Carr fire in Redding from last summer,
and the conditions that helped create
these fires to begin with.
Until then, congratulations, and I
urge the Senate to quickly move on the
confirmation process.
f
STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today just hours be-
fore our 45th President, Donald Trump,
will deliver the State of the Union Ad-
dress.
Members of Congress and guests will
fill the Chamber tonight to hear the
President speak about a host of issues
impacting America: from economic
growth to trade deals, and infrastruc-
ture investments to immigration re-
form.
I look forward to hearing about the
administration’s successes and the
plans for the future. I know that we all
want to find commonsense, bipartisan
solutions to the challenges before us.
Mr. Speaker, many distinguished
guests will be here tonight, each with a
story to tell and each representing the
very best of America.
I will host Mr. Bill Jones, president
of Penn United Technologies.
Headquartered in Cabot, Pennsylvania
in Butler County, Penn United Tech-
nologies provides high-quality, high-
precision manufacturing solutions in
various markets and employs more
than 500 individuals.
Since 1971, Penn United Technologies
has provided quality products and has
established itself as an industry leader.
It is an honor to have Mr. Jones here
this evening, and I look forward to the
President’s address.
f
HONORING MEN AND WOMEN IN
UNIFORM
(Mr. KELLY of Mississippi asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, today I would just like to give
thanks to be able to be here at this
State of the Union to hear about what
our wonderful Nation is doing.
It is such an honor to be here, and to
have the opportunity to be present dur-
ing one of these State of the Unions.
But, Mr. Speaker, most importantly, I
want to recognize the men and women
who are down range today serving this
great Nation, and who can’t be here
and probably will never be afforded the
opportunity to stand here in this great
House and hear the State of the Union.

a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of
the American people.
Many of us have campaigned on the
same core promises: to defend Amer-
ican jobs and demand fair trade for
American workers; to rebuild and revi-
talize our Nation’s infrastructure; to
reduce the price of healthcare and pre-
scription drugs; to create an immigra-
tion system that is safe, lawful, mod-
ern, and secure; and to pursue a foreign
policy that puts America’s interests
first.
There is a new opportunity in Amer-
ican politics, if only we have the cour-
age together to seize it. Victory is not
winning for our party. Victory is win-
ning for our country.
This year, America will recognize
two important anniversaries that show
us the majesty of America’s mission
and the power of American pride.
In June, we mark 75 years since the
start of what General Dwight D. Eisen-
hower called The Great Crusade—the
Allied liberation of Europe in World
War II. On D-day, June 6, 1944, 15,000
young American men jumped from the
sky and 60,000 more stormed in from
the sea to save our civilization from
tyranny.
Here with us tonight are three of
those incredible heroes: Private First
Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Ir-
ving Locker, and Sergeant Herman
Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you.
In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years
since brave young pilots flew a quarter
of a million miles through space to
plant the American flag on the face of
the moon. Half a century later, we are
joined by one of the Apollo 11 astro-
nauts who planted that flag: Buzz
Aldrin. Thank you, Buzz. This year,
American astronauts will go back to
space on American rockets.
In the 20th century, America saved
freedom, transformed science, and re-
defined the middle class. And, when
you get down to it, there is nothing
anywhere in the world that can com-
pete with America.
Now we must step boldly and bravely
into the next chapter of this great
American adventure, and we must cre-
ate a new standard of living for the 21st
century. An amazing quality of life for
all of our citizens is within reach.
We can make our communities safer,
our families stronger, our culture rich-
er, our faith deeper, and our middle
class bigger and more prosperous than
ever before.
But we must reject the politics of re-
venge, resistance, and retribution and
embrace the boundless potential of co-
operation, compromise, and the com-
mon good.
Together, we can break decades of
political stalemate. We can bridge old
divisions, heal old wounds, build new
coalitions, forge new solutions, and
unlock the extraordinary promise of
America’s future. The decision is ours
to make.
We must choose between greatness or
gridlock, results or resistance, vision
or vengeance, incredible progress or
pointless destruction.
Tonight, I ask you to choose great-
ness.
Over the last 2 years, my administra-
tion has moved with urgency and his-
toric speed to confront problems ne-
glected by leaders of both parties over
many decades.
In just over 2 years since the elec-
tion, we have launched an unprece-
dented economic boom, a boom that
has rarely been seen before. There has
been nothing like it. We have created
5.3 million new jobs and, importantly,
added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs—
something which almost everyone said
was impossible to do, but, the fact is,
we are just getting started.
Wages are rising at the fastest pace
in decades and growing for blue-collar
workers, who I promised to fight for.
They are growing faster than anyone
else thought possible.
Nearly 5 million Americans have
been lifted off food stamps. The U.S.
economy is growing almost twice as
fast today as when I took office, and we
are considered far and away the hottest
economy anywhere in the world—not
even close.
Unemployment has reached the low-
est rate in over half a century. African
American, Hispanic American, and
Asian American unemployment have
all reached their lowest levels ever re-
corded. Unemployment for Americans
with disabilities has also reached an
all-time low. More people are working
now than at any time in the history of
our country—157 million people at
work.
We passed a massive tax cut for
working families and doubled the child
tax credit.
We virtually ended the estate tax, or
death tax, as it is often called, on small
businesses, for ranches, and also for
family farms.
We eliminated the very unpopular
ObamaCare individual mandate pen-
alty. And to give critically ill patients
access to lifesaving cures, we passed,
very importantly, right to try.
My administration has cut more reg-
ulations in a short period of time than
any other administration during its en-
tire tenure. Companies are coming
back to our country in large numbers
thanks to our historic reductions in
taxes and regulations.
And we have unleashed a revolution
in American energy. The United States
is now the number one producer of oil
and natural gas anywhere in the world.
And now, for the first time in 65 years,
we are a net exporter of energy.
After 24 months of rapid progress, our
economy is the envy of the world; our
military is the most powerful on Earth,
by far; and America—America—is
again winning each and every day.
Members of Congress, the state of our
Union is strong.
That sounds so good.
Our country is vibrant and our econ-
omy is thriving like never before.
On Friday, it was announced that we
added another 304,000 jobs last month
alone, almost double the number ex-
pected. An economic miracle is taking
place in the United States, and the
only thing that can stop it are foolish
wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan
investigations.
If there is going to be peace and leg-
islation, there cannot be war and inves-
tigation. It just doesn’t work that way.
We must be united at home to defeat
our adversaries abroad.
This new era of cooperation can start
with finally confirming the more than
300 highly qualified nominees who are
still stuck in the Senate, in some
cases, years and years, waiting—not
right.
The Senate has failed to act on these
nominations, which is unfair to the
nominees and very unfair to our coun-
try. Now is the time for bipartisan ac-
tion. Believe it or not, we have already
proven that that is possible.
In the last Congress, both parties
came together to pass unprecedented
legislation to confront the opioid cri-
sis, a sweeping new farm bill, historic
VA reforms; and after four decades of
rejection, we passed VA Accountability
so that we can finally terminate those
who mistreat our wonderful veterans.
And just weeks ago, both parties
united for groundbreaking criminal
justice reform. They said it couldn’t be
done.
Last year, I heard, through friends,
the story of Alice Johnson. I was deep-
ly moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced
to life in prison as a first-time non-
violent drug offender. Over the next 22
years, she became a prison minister,
inspiring others to choose a better
path. She had a big impact on that
prison population—and far beyond.
Alice’s story underscores the dispari-
ties and unfairness that can exist in
criminal sentencing and the need to
remedy this total injustice. She served
almost that 22 years and had expected
to be in prison for the remainder of her
life.
In June, I commuted Alice’s sen-
tence. When I saw Alice’s beautiful
family greet her at the prison gates,
hugging and kissing and crying and
laughing, I knew I did something right.
Alice is with us tonight, and she is a
terrific woman, terrific.
Alice, please.
Alice, thank you for reminding us
that we always have the power to shape
our own destiny. Thank you very
much, Alice. Thank you very much.
Inspired by stories like Alice’s, my
administration worked closely with
members of both parties to sign the
First Step Act into law. Big deal. It is
a big deal.
This legislation reformed sentencing
laws that have wrongly and dispropor-
tionately harmed the African Amer-
ican community. The First Step Act
gives nonviolent offenders the chance
to reenter society as productive, law-
abiding citizens. Now, States across
the country are following our lead.
America is a nation that believes in re-
demption.
We are also joined tonight by Mat-
thew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996,

at the age of 30, Matthew was sen-
tenced to 35 years for selling drugs and
related offenses. Over the next two dec-
ades, he completed more than 30 Bible
studies, became a law clerk, and
mentored many of his fellow inmates.
Now, Matthew is the very first person
to be released from prison under the
First Step Act.
Matthew, please. Thank you, Mat-
thew. Welcome home.
Now, Republicans and Democrats
must join forces again to confront an
urgent national crisis. Congress has 10
days left to pass a bill that will fund
our government, protect our homeland,
and secure our very dangerous south-
ern border.
Now is the time for Congress to show
the world that America is committed
to ending illegal immigration and put-
ting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug
dealers, and human traffickers out of
business.
As we speak, large, organized cara-
vans are on the march to the United
States. We have just heard that Mexi-
can cities, in order to remove the ille-
gal immigrants from their commu-
nities, are getting trucks and buses to
bring them up to our country in areas
where there is little border protection.
I have ordered another 3,750 troops to
our southern border to prepare for this
tremendous onslaught.
This is a moral issue. The lawless
state of our southern border is a threat
to the safety, security, and financial
well-being of all America. We have a
moral duty to create an immigration
system that protects the lives and jobs
of our citizens. This includes our obli-
gation to the millions of immigrants
living here today who followed the
rules and respected our laws.
Legal immigrants enrich our Nation
and strengthen our society in countless
ways. I want people to come into our
country in the largest numbers ever,
but they have to come in legally.
Tonight, I am asking you to defend
our very dangerous southern border out
of love and devotion to our fellow citi-
zens and to our country.
No issue better illustrates the divide
between America’s working class and
America’s political class than illegal
immigration. Wealthy politicians and
donors push for open borders while liv-
ing their lives behind walls and gates
and guards. Meanwhile, working-class
Americans are left to pay the price for
mass illegal immigration, reduced jobs,
lower wages, overburdened schools,
hospitals that are so crowded you can’t
get in, increased crime, and a depleted
social safety net.
Tolerance for illegal immigration is
not compassionate. It is actually very
cruel. One in three women is sexually
assaulted on the long journey north.
Smugglers use migrant children as
human pawns to exploit our laws and
gain access to our country.
Human traffickers and sex traffickers
take advantage of the wide-open areas
between our ports of entry to smuggle
thousands of young girls and women
into the United States and to sell them
into prostitution and modern-day slav-
ery.
Tens of thousands of innocent Ameri-
cans are killed by lethal drugs that
cross our border and flood into our cit-
ies, including meth, heroin, cocaine,
and fentanyl.
The savage gang MS–13 now operates
in at least 20 different American
States, and they almost all come
through our southern border. Just yes-
terday, an MS–13 gang member was
taken into custody for a fatal shooting
on a subway platform in New York
City. We are removing these gang
members by the thousands, but until
we secure our border, they are going to
keep streaming right back in.
Year after year, countless Americans
are murdered by criminal illegal
aliens. I have gotten to know many
wonderful angel moms and dads and
families. No one should ever have to
suffer the horrible heartache that they
have had to endure.
Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just 3
weeks ago, Debra’s parents, Gerald and
Sharon, were burglarized and shot to
death in their Reno, Nevada, home by
an illegal alien. They were in their 80s,
and they are survived by four children,
11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grand-
children. Also here tonight are Gerald
and Sharon’s granddaughter, Heather,
and great-granddaughter, Madison.
To Debra, Heather, Madison, please
stand. Few can understand your pain.
Thank you, and thank you for being
here. Thank you very much.
I will never forget, and I will fight for
the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that
it should never happen again.
Not one more American life should be
lost because our Nation failed to con-
trol its very dangerous border.
In the last 2 years, our brave ICE of-
ficers made 266,000 arrests of criminal
aliens, including those charged or con-
victed of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000
sex crimes, and 4,000 killings or mur-
ders.
We are joined tonight by one of those
law enforcement heroes, ICE Special
Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin
was a boy, he and his family legally
immigrated to the United States from
the Dominican Republic. At the age of
8, Elvin told his dad he wanted to be-
come a special agent. Today, he leads
investigations into the scourge of
international sex trafficking. Elvin
says: ‘‘If I can make sure these young
girls get their justice, I’ve really done
my job.’’ Thanks to his work and that
of his incredible colleagues, more than
300 women and girls have been rescued
from the horror of this terrible situa-
tion, and more than 1,500 sadistic traf-
fickers have been put behind bars.
Thank you, Elvin.
We will always support the brave
men and women of law enforcement,
and I pledge to you tonight that I will
never abolish our heroes from ICE.
Thank you.
My administration has sent to Con-
gress a commonsense proposal to end
the crisis on the southern border. It in-
cludes humanitarian assistance, more
law enforcement, drug detection at our
ports, closing loopholes that enable
child smuggling, and plans for a new
physical barrier, or wall, to secure the
vast areas between our ports of entry.
In the past, most of the people in this
room voted for a wall, but the proper
wall never got built. I will get it built.
This is a smart, strategic, see-
through steel barrier, not just a simple
concrete wall. It will be deployed in the
areas identified by the border agents as
having the greatest need, and these
agents will tell you, where walls go up,
illegal crossings go way, way down.
San Diego used to have the most ille-
gal border crossings in our country. In
response, a strong security wall was
put in place. This powerful barrier al-
most completely ended illegal cross-
ings.
The border city of El Paso, Texas,
used to have extremely high rates of
violent crime, one of the highest in the
entire country, and was considered one
of our Nation’s most dangerous cities.
Now, immediately upon its building,
with a powerful barrier in place, El
Paso is one of the safest cities in our
country.
Simply put, walls work and walls
save lives. So let’s work together, com-
promise, and reach a deal that will
truly make America safe.
As we work to defend our people’s
safety, we must also ensure our eco-
nomic resurgence continues at a rapid
pace.
No one has benefited more from our
thriving economy than women, who
have filled 58 percent of the newly cre-
ated jobs last year.
You weren’t supposed to do that.
Thank you very much. Thank you very
much.
All Americans can be proud that we
have more women in the workforce
than ever before—don’t sit yet; you are
going to like this—and exactly one cen-
tury after Congress passed the con-
stitutional amendment giving women
the right to vote, we also have more
women serving in Congress than at any
time before.
That is great, very great. And con-
gratulations. That is great.
As part of our commitment to im-
proving opportunity for women every-
where, this Thursday we are launching
the first ever governmentwide initia-
tive focused on economic empower-
ment for women in developing coun-
tries.
To build on our incredible economic
success, one priority is paramount: re-
versing decades of calamitous trade
policies—so bad.
We are now making it clear to China
that after years of targeting our indus-
tries and stealing our intellectual prop-
erty, the theft of American jobs and
wealth has come to an end.
Therefore, we recently imposed tar-
iffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods,
and now our Treasury is receiving bil-
lions and billions of dollars. But I don’t

blame China for taking advantage of
us. I blame our leaders and representa-
tives for allowing this travesty to hap-
pen.
I have great respect for President Xi,
and we are now working on a new trade
deal with China, but it must include
real structural change to end unfair
trade practices, reduce our chronic
trade deficit, and protect American
jobs.
Thank you.
Another historic trade blunder was
the catastrophe known as NAFTA. I
have met the men and women of Michi-
gan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New
Hampshire, and many other states
whose dreams were shattered by the
signing of NAFTA.
For years, politicians promised them
they would renegotiate for a better
deal, but no one ever tried until now.
Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment—the USMCA—will replace
NAFTA and deliver for American work-
ers, like they haven’t had delivered to
for a long time.
I hope you can pass the USMCA into
law so that we can bring back our man-
ufacturing jobs in even greater num-
bers, expand American agriculture,
protect intellectual property, and en-
sure that more cars are proudly
stamped with our four beautiful words:
Made in the USA.
Tonight, I am also asking you to pass
the United States Reciprocal Trade
Act, so that if another country places
an unfair tariff on an American prod-
uct, we can charge them the exact
same tariff on the exact same product
that they sell to us.
Both parties should be able to unite
for a great rebuilding of America’s
crumbling infrastructure.
I know that Congress is eager to pass
an infrastructure bill, and I am eager
to work with you on legislation to de-
liver new and important infrastructure
investment, including investments in
the cutting-edge industries of the fu-
ture. This is not an option. This is a
necessity.
The next major priority for me, and
for all of us, should be to lower the cost
of healthcare and prescription drugs
and to protect patients with pre-
existing conditions.
Already, as a result of my adminis-
tration’s efforts, in 2018, drug prices ex-
perienced their single largest decline in
46 years. But we must do more. It is un-
acceptable that Americans pay vastly
more than people in other countries for
the exact same drugs, often made in
the exact same place. This is wrong;
this is unfair; and, together, we will
stop it, and we will stop it fast.
I am asking Congress to pass legisla-
tion that finally takes on the problem
of global freeloading and delivers fair-
ness and price transparency for Amer-
ican patients—finally.
We should also require drug compa-
nies, insurance companies, and hos-
pitals to disclose real prices to foster
competition and bring costs way down.
No force in history has done more to
advance the human condition than
American freedom. In recent years, we
have made remarkable progress in the
fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific
breakthroughs have brought a once-
distant dream within reach.
My budget will ask Democrats and
Republicans to make the needed com-
mitment to eliminate the HIV epi-
demic in the United States within 10
years. We have made incredible
strides—incredible. Together, we will
defeat AIDS in America and beyond.
Tonight, I am also asking you to join
me in another fight that all Americans
can get behind: The fight against child-
hood cancer.
Joining Melania in the gallery this
evening is a very brave 10-year old girl,
Grace Eline.
Hi, Grace.
Every birthday since she was 4, Grace
asked her friends to donate to St. Jude
Children’s Hospital. She did not know
that one day she might be a patient
herself. That is what happened.
Last year, Grace was diagnosed with
brain cancer. Immediately, she began
radiation treatment. At the same time,
she rallied her community and raised
more than $40,000 for the fight against
cancer.
When Grace completed treatment
last fall, her doctors and nurses
cheered—they loved her; they still love
her—with tears in their eyes as she
hung up a poster that read: ‘‘Last day
of chemo.’’
Thank you very much, Grace. You
are a great inspiration to everyone in
this room. Thank you very much.
Many childhood cancers have not
seen new therapies in decades. My
budget will ask Congress for $500 mil-
lion over the next 10 years to fund this
critical life-saving research.
To help support working parents, the
time has come to pass school choice for
America’s children. I am also proud to
be the first President to include in my
budget a plan for nationwide paid fam-
ily leave, so that every new parent has
the chance to bond with their newborn
child.
There could be no greater contrast to
the beautiful image of a mother hold-
ing her infant child than the chilling
displays our Nation saw in recent days.
Lawmakers in New York cheered with
delight upon the passage of legislation
that would allow a baby to be ripped
from the mother’s womb moments be-
fore birth. These are living, feeling,
beautiful babies who will never get the
chance to share their love and their
dreams with the world. And then, we
had the case of the Governor of Vir-
ginia where he stated he would execute
a baby after birth.
To defend the dignity of every per-
son, I am asking Congress to pass legis-
lation to prohibit the late-term abor-
tion of children who can feel pain in
the mother’s womb.
Let us work together to build a cul-
ture that cherishes innocent life. And
let us reaffirm a fundamental truth:
All children, born and unborn, are
made in the holy image of God.
The final part of my agenda is to pro-
tect America’s national security. Over
the last 2 years, we have begun to fully
rebuild the United States military with
$700 billion last year and $716 billion
this year. We are also getting other na-
tions to pay their fair share, finally.
Finally.
For years, the United States was
being treated very unfairly by friends
of ours, members of NATO, but now we
have secured, over the last couple of
years, more than $100 billion of in-
crease in defense spending from our
NATO allies. They said it couldn’t be
done.
As part of our military buildup, the
United States is developing a state-of-
the-art missile defense system. Under
my administration, we will never
apologize for advancing America’s in-
terests.
For example, decades ago, the United
States entered into a treaty with Rus-
sia in which we agreed to limit and re-
duce our missile capability. While we
followed the agreement and the rules
to the letter, Russia repeatedly vio-
lated its terms. It has been going on for
many years.
That is why I announced that the
United States is officially withdrawing
from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty. We real-
ly have no choice.
Perhaps we can negotiate a different
agreement, adding China and others, or
perhaps we can’t. In which case, we
will outspend and out-innovate all oth-
ers by far.
As part of a bold, new diplomacy, we
continue our historic push for peace on
the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages
have come home; nuclear testing has
stopped; and there has not been a mis-
sile launch in more than 15 months.
If I had not been elected President of
the United States, we would, right now,
in my opinion, be in a major war with
North Korea. Much work remains to be
done, but my relationship with Kim
Jong-un is a good one. Chairman KIM
and I will meet again on February 27
and 28 in Vietnam.
Two weeks ago, the United States of-
ficially recognized the legitimate Gov-
ernment of Venezuela and its new
President, Juan Guaido. We stand with
the Venezuelan people in their noble
quest for freedom, and we condemn the
brutality of the Maduro regime, whose
socialist policies have turned that na-
tion from being the wealthiest in
South America into a state of abject
poverty and despair.
Here in the United States, we are
alarmed by the new calls to adopt so-
cialism in our country. America was
founded on liberty and independence
and not government coercion, domina-
tion, and control. We are born free, and
we will stay free.
Tonight, we renew our resolve that
America will never be a Socialist coun-
try.
One of the most complex set of chal-
lenges we face—and have for many
years—is in the Middle East. Our ap-
proach is based on principled realism,

not discredited theories that have
failed for decades to yield progress. For
this reason, my administration recog-
nized the true capital of Israel and
proudly opened the American Embassy
in Jerusalem.
Our brave troops have now been
fighting in the Middle East for almost
19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, near-
ly 7,000 American heroes have given
their lives. More than 52,000 Americans
have been badly wounded. We have
spent more than $7 trillion in fighting
wars in the Middle East.
As a candidate for President, I loudly
pledged a new approach. Great nations
do not fight endless wars.
When I took office, ISIS controlled
more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq
and Syria—just 2 years ago. Today, we
have liberated virtually all of the terri-
tory from the grip of these blood-
thirsty monsters.
Now, as we work with our allies to
destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time
to give our brave warriors in Syria a
warm welcome home.
I have also accelerated our negotia-
tions to reach, if possible, a political
settlement in Afghanistan. The oppos-
ing side is also very happy to be negoti-
ating. Our troops have fought with un-
matched valor, and thanks to their
bravery, we are now able to pursue a
possible political solution to this long
and bloody conflict.
In Afghanistan, my administration is
holding constructive talks with a num-
ber of Afghan groups, including the
Taliban. As we make progress in these
negotiations, we will be able to reduce
our troop presence and focus on coun-
terterrorism. We will indeed focus on
counterterrorism. We do not know
whether we will achieve an agreement,
but we do know that after two decades
of war, the hour has come to at least
try for peace, and the other side would
like to do the same thing. It is time.
Above all, friend and foe alike must
never doubt this Nation’s power and
will to defend our people. Eighteen
years ago, violent terrorists attacked
the USS Cole, and last month, Amer-
ican forces killed one of the leaders of
that attack.
We are honored to be joined tonight
by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy
Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of
the 17 sailors we tragically lost.
Tom, we vow to always remember the
heroes of the USS Cole.
My administration has acted deci-
sively to confront the world’s leading
state sponsor of terror: the radical re-
gime in Iran. It is a radical regime.
They do bad, bad things.
To ensure this corrupt dictatorship
never acquires nuclear weapons, I with-
drew the United States from the disas-
trous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall,
we put in place the toughest sanctions
ever imposed by us on a country.
We will not avert our eyes from a re-
gime that chants ‘‘death to America’’
and threatens genocide against the
Jewish people. We must never ignore
the vile poison of anti-Semitism or
those who spread its venomous creed.
With one voice, we must confront this
hatred anywhere and everywhere it oc-
curs.
Just months ago, 11 Jewish Ameri-
cans were viciously murdered in an
anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life
synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT officer
Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire
and was shot seven times chasing down
the killer. He was very successful. Tim-
othy has just had his 12th surgery. He
is going in for many more, but he made
the trip to be here with us tonight.
Officer Matson, thank you. We are
forever grateful. Thank you very much.
Tonight, we are also joined by Pitts-
burgh survivor Judah Samet. He ar-
rived at the synagogue as the massacre
began. But not only did Judah nar-
rowly escape death last fall, more than
seven decades ago he narrowly survived
the Nazi concentration camps. Today is
Judah’s 81st birthday.
They wouldn’t do that for me, Judah.
Judah says he can still remember the
exact moment, nearly 75 years ago,
after 10 months in a concentration
camp, when he and his family were put
on a train and told they were going to
another camp. Suddenly, the train
screeched to a very strong halt. A sol-
dier appeared. Judah’s family braced
for the absolute worst. Then his father
cried out with joy: ‘‘It’s the Americans.
It’s the Americans.’’
Thank you.
A second Holocaust survivor who is
here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a
prisoner at Dachau. He remembers
watching through a hole in the wall of
a cattle car as American soldiers rolled
in with tanks.
‘‘To me,’’ Joshua recalls, ‘‘the Amer-
ican soldiers were proof that God ex-
ists, and they came down from the
sky.’’ They came down from heaven.
I began this evening by honoring
three soldiers who fought on D-day in
the Second World War. One of them
was Herman Zeitchik, but there is
more to Herman’s story. A year after
he stormed the beaches of Normandy,
Herman was one of the American sol-
diers who helped liberate Dachau. He
was one of the Americans who helped
rescue Joshua from that hell on Earth.
Almost 75 years later, Herman and
Joshua are both together in the gallery
tonight, seated side by side, here in the
home of American freedom.
Herman and Joshua, your presence
this evening is very much appreciated.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
When American soldiers set out be-
neath the dark skies over the English
Channel in the early hours of D-day
1944, they were just young men of 18
and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft
toward the most momentous battle in
the history of war. They did not know
if they would survive the hour. They
did not know if they would grow old.
But they knew that America had to
prevail. Their cause was this Nation
and generations yet unborn.
Why did they do it? They did it for
America. They did it for us. Everything
that has come since—our triumph over
communism, our giant leaps of science
and discovery, our unrivaled progress
toward equality and justice—all of it is
possible thanks to the blood and tears
and courage and vision of the Ameri-
cans who came before.
Think of this Capitol. Think of this
very Chamber, where lawmakers before
you voted to end slavery, to build the
railroads and the highways and defeat
fascism, to secure civil rights and to
face down evil empires.
Here tonight, we have legislators
from across this magnificent Republic.
You have come from the rocky shores
of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Ha-
waii, from the snowy woods of Wis-
consin and the red deserts of Arizona,
from the green farms of Kentucky and
the golden beaches of California. To-
gether, we represent the most extraor-
dinary Nation in all of history.
What will we do with this moment?
How will we be remembered?
I ask the men and women of this Con-
gress: Look at the opportunities before
us. Our most thrilling achievements
are still ahead. Our most exciting jour-
neys still await. Our biggest victories
are still to come. We have not yet
begun to dream.
We must choose whether we are de-
fined by our differences or whether we
dare to transcend them. We must
choose whether we squander our great
inheritance or whether we proudly de-
clare that we are Americans. We do the
incredible. We defy the impossible. We
conquer the unknown.
This is the time to reignite the
American imagination. This is the
time to search for the tallest summit
and set our sights on the brightest
star. This is the time to rekindle the
bonds of love and loyalty and memory
that link us together as citizens, as
neighbors, as patriots.
This is our future—our fate—and our
choice to make. I am asking you to
choose greatness.
No matter the trials we face, no mat-
ter the challenges to come, we must go
forward together.
We must keep America first in our
hearts. We must keep freedom alive in
our souls. And we must always keep
faith in America’s destiny, that one na-
tion, under God, must be the hope and
the promise and the light and the glory
among all the nations of the world.
Thank you. God bless you, and God
bless America. Thank you very much.

who know and love You. Remind us
that righteousness exalts a nation, but
sin is a reproach to many people.
Today guide our lawmakers so that
they will live for Your honor. Increase
their faith, hope, and love, enabling

SENATE AGENDA
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
yesterday the Senate took another step
toward delivering an important pack-
age of legislation. We passed my
amendment to Strengthening Amer-
ica’s Security in the Middle East Act
and voted to advance the bill, both by
very wide bipartisan margins. S. 1 rep-
resents the broad consensus of this
body about our Nation’s responsibil-
ities as an ally and a partner. It reaf-
firms our promise to uphold Israel’s se-
curity, to help Jordan face complex se-
curity challenges, and to hold Bashar
al-Assad’s murderous henchmen ac-
countable.
I look forward to the Senate voting
on final passage soon and sending this
bipartisan legislation over to the
House.
After we complete that work, the
Senate will return to the Natural Re-
sources Management Act, a high-pri-
ority bill containing more than 100 pro-
posals concerning economic develop-
ment, public lands, water resources,
and conservation.
f
STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on another matter, tonight Congress
will host President Trump for his sec-
ond State of the Union Address. I am
looking forward to attending and hear-
ing the President reflect on the great
strides our Nation has made over the
past 2 years and his vision for the chal-
lenges that are still before us.
From historic tax reform and regu-
latory reform, to huge progress in the
fight against ISIS, to landmark
progress in the nationwide fight
against opioid addiction, the story over
the last 2 years has been one of im-
mense policy progress for our country.
The American people are less inter-
ested in beltway melodrama and more
interested in the classic question: Am I
better off than I was 2 years ago? On
this front, thanks to a few key Repub-
lican victories and a number of major
bipartisan accomplishments, the state
of the Union is strong and growing
stronger.
It has now been more than 2 years
since the American people hired Presi-
dent Trump and a Republican Congress
to get Washington’s foot off the brake
of our economy. Since then, we got to
work rebuilding the middle-class pros-
perity that had hollowed out commu-
nities across America under the Obama
economy.
After 8 years of watching leftwing
policies disproportionately benefit
coastal cities and our Nation’s largest
metro areas while mostly leaving small
cities, small towns, suburbs, and rural
America behind, the American people
wanted a change.
That is exactly what the last 2 years’
policies have delivered. Historic tax re-
form delivered higher take-home pay
and helped breathe life into the engine
of American job creation and innova-
tion. Landmark regulatory reform cut
burdensome compliance costs for small
businesses, reigned in Federal over-
reach on education policy, and de-
fended Americans’ rights of conscience.
So what are these policies doing for
the American people? I think the an-
swer is pretty clear. All those Ameri-
cans who had been struggling to find
work? Well, today a higher percentage
of Americans are working than were
ever working at any point under Presi-
dent Obama. For the first time in mod-
ern recorded history, we have reached
and stayed at a level where there are
more job openings nationwide than
Americans looking for jobs.
Listen to these headlines: ‘‘Employ-
ers’ Hiring Push Brings Workers Off
the Bench.’’ ‘‘Disability Applications
Plunge as the Economy Strengthens.’’
Listen to this, from one news article:
The tighter labor market is delivering op-
portunities to a broad swath of workers who
were disproportionately affected by the last
recession. Unemployment has fallen sharply
for blacks, Latinos, younger workers and
those without a college education . . . [and]
the deeper jobs pool has been particularly
crucial for improving the economic outlook
for disabled Americans.
These and many more Americans
have been able to find work, but what
about Americans who already had jobs
but felt like their families were tread-
ing water and needed to get ahead?
Last year, the amount of money em-
ployers spent compensating American
workers—those already working—grew

at its fastest pace in more than 10
years. Thanks to tax reform, when
many working families and small busi-
nesses file under the new Tax Code,
they will see less of their money has
been sent off to the IRS.
So there are more jobs to choose
from, more wage growth, and higher
take-home pay following tax cuts, but
it is also worth looking at where this
new prosperity is going.
The last administration’s leftwing
policies disproportionately benefited
the Nation’s largest metropolitan
areas. It turns out, policies dreamt up
in places like New York and San Fran-
cisco worked pretty well in places like
New York and San Francisco, but the
rest of the country decided we could do
better.
Today businesses on Main Street and
family farms are dusting off their
‘‘Help Wanted’’ signs. Smaller cities
and States like Indiana, Nebraska, and
Ohio have so many job openings that
some of these communities are offering
sizeable cash bonuses to move there.
Smaller communities and rural Amer-
ica recently outpaced the rest of the
country in relative job creation. So it
is an all-American comeback, and the
kinds of places liberal policies left be-
hind are now at the front of the pack.
I have focused this morning on our
robust economy. It is helping American
families lift themselves higher, but it
is just one part of the success story the
President will be able to tell tonight.
The last 2 years have seen the White
House and the Congress work together
to identify pressing national chal-
lenges and to develop big bipartisan
compromise solutions to attack them
head-on. Working together, both par-
ties collaborated on more than a dozen
targeted measures to improve access to
quality care for our Nation’s veterans
and passed landmark legislation to
help local communities heal the
wounds created by opioid addiction.
I am delighted to have one of these
local champions as my guest tonight.
Lisa Minton is leading on the
frontlines of Kentucky’s battle against
opioid abuse. She runs the Chrysalis
House, a treatment facility for preg-
nant and new mothers fighting addic-
tion in Lexington.
In 2017, I worked with Lisa to secure
a $2.6 million grant to expand their
services for low-income women and
their children. I am glad she will be in
the House Chamber this evening, and I
am proud to highlight her amazing
work this morning.
Working together, a bipartisan ma-
jority ended the harmful spending caps
that hampered military readiness and
made major progress restoring regular
order appropriations on behalf of the
American taxpayer. A bipartisan ma-
jority delivered commonsense relief for
local lenders on Main Street from the
burden of regulations designed for Wall
Street.
These are just a few examples, and it
is a good thing we know we can tap
into that bipartisan spirit because the
American people did not hire us to
spend the next 2 years in total grid-
lock. That is not what they did. When
the American people elect divided gov-
ernment, they are saying: We know
you disagree on a lot of things, but
look to the things you agree on and do
those.
If the past few weeks have shown
anything, it is that we need to work to-
gether across the aisle in order to do
our work, and make no mistake, there
are significant challenges ahead, such
as addressing the ongoing security and
humanitarian crisis at our southern
border, lowering the cost of healthcare
and prescription drugs, and taking fur-
ther steps to rebuild America’s infra-
structure.
Tonight I expect the President will
offer a serious vision to deal with chal-
lenges like these. I look forward to
hearing from him and then, throughout
the coming year, I look forward to the
Senate working closely with him and
working closely with each other across
the aisle to do just that.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.

f
STATE OF THE UNION
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
later this evening, in front of a joint
session of Congress, President Trump
will report on the state of our Union.
As is tradition, the President will that
say the state of our Union is strong,
but the American people know the
truth. Unfortunately, it is not.
The American people know that the
Trump economy is failing the middle
class and those struggling to get there.
In Trump’s economy, multinational
corporations and the already-wealthy
were given a tax cut, while American
workers were left behind. The Federal
Reserve reports that over 40 percent of
Americans would have trouble covering
an emergency of just $400. Forty per-
cent of working Americans, middle-
class Americans, are just one medical
bill, one unexpected car accident, one
missed paycheck away from financial
uncertainty. The state of the Trump
economy—failing the middle class.
The President will say that the state
of our Union is strong, but the Amer-
ican people know that the state of the
Trump healthcare system is failing
American families. After 2 years of re-
lentless sabotage by the Trump admin-
istration and congressional Repub-
licans, premiums are higher than they
should be, copays are higher than they
should be, and for the first time in 8
years, fewer Americans have health in-
surance than the year before. The state
of the Trump healthcare system—fail-
ing the middle class.
The President will say that the state
of our Union is strong, but the Amer-
ican people know that the state of the
Trump administration is in chaos. No
administration has had as much Cabi-
net turnover as the Trump administra-
tion in over a century. Key positions
are unfilled or uncovered or covered by
individuals in an acting capacity—the
Chief of Staff, the Attorney General,
the Defense Secretary, the Interior
Secretary, the OMB Director, and the
EPA Director. Of the 705 top positions
in the government, in close to one-
fifth, the President hasn’t even nomi-
nated somebody. The state of the
Trump administration—chaos.
The President will say that the state
of our Union is strong, but the state of
the Trump foreign policy is woefully
backward. It is inside out. Our allies
are alienated and criticized. Our adver-
saries are emboldened and praised. Dic-
tators and strongmen are given license
by this administration, while our
NATO allies receive harsh words.
American values—free speech, free
elections, freedom of the press, human-
itarian rights, civil rights—go
undefended in the dark corners of the
world. The state of the Trump foreign
policy—woefully backward.
The state of the Union is not strong.
The state of the Trump economy—fail-
ing America’s middle class. The state
of the Trump healthcare—failing
American families. The state of the
Trump administration—chaos. The
state of the Trump foreign policy—
woefully backward, inside out.
These are not the total extent of our
Nation’s challenges, but even on these
four metrics—the economy, healthcare,
governance, and foreign policy—the
state of our Union is in need of drastic
repair. Still, knowing this President
and his penchant for hyperbole, he will
probably say that the state of our
Union is stronger than it has ever been
before in our Nation’s long history,
thanks to him. Knowing this President,
he will rely on distortions and made-up
facts to mislead the American people.
The only question about the Presi-
dent’s State of the Union is, How often
will he distort? How often will he make
up facts? How often will he resort to
fear and divisiveness? And if past
States of the Union are prologue, he
will do that far too many times.
Knowing this President, he will then
make some bold new promises and not
even make an attempt to fulfill them.
The man has so little integrity that a
promise he makes at the State of the
Union means nothing the next morn-
ing. Allow me to mention just a few of
the things the President said in pre-
vious State of the Union Addresses.
Do you remember this one? In his
first address to a joint session, Presi-
dent Trump said: ‘‘Education is the

civil rights issue of our time.’’ It has
been 2 years, and we have heard almost
nothing from the President about an
education bill.
In the last State of the Union, just 1
year ago, the President said: ‘‘One of
my greatest priorities is to reduce the
price of prescription drugs. . . . Prices
will come down.’’ But over the course
of the last month, nearly 30
drugmakers have taken steps to raise
the prices of their medicines.
In the last State of the Union, the
President promised that ‘‘[manufac-
turing] plants will be opening up all
over the country.’’ I don’t know about
you, Mr. President, but I haven’t seen a
remanufacturing policy from the White
House. Meanwhile, Nissan has an-
nounced hundreds of layoffs in Mis-
sissippi, and GM has announced the
closure of 5 factories and the loss of
15,000 jobs.
In the last State of the Union, the
President said: ‘‘We will protect Amer-
ican workers and American intellec-
tual property through strong enforce-
ment of our trade rules.’’ That is some-
thing I strongly agree with. Six
months after the President said that,
he decided to let a Chinese telecom
giant, ZTE—a company that violated
multiple trade sanctions and put our
Nation’s security at risk—off the hook
and begin operating in the United
States. Now, while some in the admin-
istration are pushing him to be tough
on China, there are some who just want
to sell out for a decrease in the trade
deficit. That will not do the job the
President always promised he would.
In the last State of the Union, the
President said: ‘‘No regime has op-
pressed its own citizens more totally or
brutally than the cruel dictatorship in
North Korea. . . . We are waging a
campaign of maximum pressure to pre-
vent that from happening.’’ After that,
what happened? The President hosted a
largely symbolic summit with Kim
Jong Un and is already planning a sec-
ond summit. North Korea has failed to
dismantle its nuclear program—some
reports say it is growing—and the
United States is not engaging in a pres-
sure campaign, maximum or otherwise.
President Trump called for a com-
promise immigration bill that dealt
with Dreamers and border security.
Congress produced one along the lines
he proposed, and then he threatened to
veto it.
In the last State of the Union, the
President said ‘‘It is time to rebuild
our crumbling infrastructure’’ and
called for new legislation to spur in-
vestment. He said: ‘‘Let’s support
working families by supporting paid
family leave.’’ He said: ‘‘We will con-
tinue our fight until ISIS is defeated.’’
What are the facts? There has been no
infrastructure bill, although he prom-
ised one in the previous State of the
Union; no paid family leave proposal,
although he promised one in the pre-
vious State of the Union; and he is
withdrawing from Syria even though
he promised we would continue the
fight until ISIS is defeated. And by all
reports, including our own intelligence,
it is not.
I could go on. The list of broken or
empty promises is long. The gap be-
tween the President’s rhetoric and re-
ality is cavernous. Every President
uses the State of the Union to set
goals, but few have done it so cheaply
and indifferently. Many of those prom-
ises were discarded mere weeks after
they were uttered.
Forgive me, but if we Democrats and
the American people have real doubt
about any promise the President
makes, real doubt about his following
through or really meaning it, how can
we not? In previous State of the Union
Addresses, he has thrown around prom-
ises and not fulfilled them more than
any other President I know.
Perhaps even emptier than his policy
promises are President Trump’s calls
for unity each year. It seems that
every year the President wakes up and
discovers the desire for unity on the
morning of the State of the Union.
Then the President spends the other
364 days of the year dividing us and
sowing a state of disunion, whether
that is using public servants as polit-
ical pawns, the President’s false
equivalence after Charlottesville, his
attacks on the Federal judiciary, the
free press, and the rule of law, or his
near-daily twitter provocations. The
blatant hypocrisy of this President
calling for unity is that he is one of the
chief reasons Americans feel so divided
now.
So it is logical to believe, based on
his past speeches, that the President’s
speech tonight will ignore the reality
of his administration, the reality of
our economy, the reality of our world,
and instead weave a web of fiction. If
past speeches are an indication, the
President will be in his own bubble.
Democrats are not focused on the
President’s rhetoric; we are focused on
fighting for workers in this unequal
economy, fighting for American fami-
lies struggling to afford healthcare,
fighting to bring a measure of account-
ability to this government, and fight-
ing for a foreign policy that reflects
both our interests and our values.

S. 130
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, last
night, our colleague from Nebraska,
Senator BEN SASSE, brought a bill to
the floor to protect infants who are
born alive during abortions.
The legislation is simple. In the
words of the bill, it finds:
If an abortion results in the live birth of an
infant, the infant is a legal person for all
purposes under the laws of the United
States, and entitled to all the protections of
such laws. Any infant born alive after an
abortion . . . has the same claim to the pro-
tection of the law that would arise for any
newborn.
In other words, any living, breathing
baby outside of its mother’s body
should be protected. That is a pretty
basic standard of decency. One would
assume that there is no human being
alive who would object to such a bill—
that even my colleagues across the
aisle who don’t think that living,
breathing unborn babies should be pro-
tected could get behind this bill—but
you would be wrong because, last
night, Senate Democrats objected to
the consideration of this bill. They ob-
jected to the consideration of legisla-
tion to protect babies who are born
alive.
Let’s take a step back and remember
why Senator SASSE brought this bill up
in the first place.
Last week, the Democratic Governor
of Virginia was asked about an extreme
proposal from a Virginia Democrat to
remove restrictions on late-term abor-
tions. In his comments on the bill, the
Virginia Governor had this to say:
If a mother is in labor, I can tell you ex-
actly what would happen. The infant would
be delivered. The infant would be kept com-
fortable. The infant would be resuscitated if
that’s what the mother and the family de-
sired, and then a discussion would ensue be-
tween the physicians and the mother.
In other words, the Democratic Gov-
ernor of Virginia not only endorsed

late-term abortions—abortions per-
formed on babies old enough to survive
outside of the mothers—he left open
the door to infanticide. He left open
the possibility of killing a baby born
alive.
I would think those would be com-
ments that my Democratic colleagues
would be recoiling from in horror. I
would think they would be rushing to
make it very clear that they absolutely
do not support the killing of a baby
born alive. Yet, yesterday, my Demo-
cratic colleagues objected to a bill that
would do nothing more than declare
that any infant who is born alive dur-
ing an abortion is entitled to be pro-
tected—to be given the basic medical
care that would be afforded any other
baby.
Most Americans think there should
be, at least, some limits on abortion.
Most countries in the world think
there should be some limits on abor-
tion. Only China, North Korea, the
United States, and two other countries
allow elective abortions through all 9
months of pregnancy—not a list we
ought to be on. At least some of my
Democratic colleagues used to be a lit-
tle bit more moderate on the issue of
abortion. Safe, legal, and rare was
their claim, which you always heard
them say, but, yesterday, my Demo-
cratic colleagues made it very clear
that they have decided to dispense with
moderation and espouse the most rad-
ical and extreme position possible—no
restrictions at all on abortion, ever, up
to and, apparently, now after the mo-
ment of birth.
Chuck Colson, the founder of Prison
Fellowship, once noted: ‘‘A government
cannot be truly just without affirming
the intrinsic value of human life.’’
I think it is fair to say that pretty
much every great injustice in human
history sprang from a failure to affirm
the intrinsic value of every human
life—from a decision that certain indi-
viduals’ rights were not equal to those
of others or that their life or liberty
could be sacrificed for the greater
good.
Today, we unfortunately see another
great injustice with the failure to af-
firm the value of the lives of the most
vulnerable among us.
I am horrified by my Democratic col-
leagues’ decision to object to legisla-
tion to protect babies born alive, and I
will continue to fight to ensure that
the right to life of every human being,
born and unborn, is protected.
THE ECONOMY
Madam President, here are just some
of the news stories we saw at the end of
last week. This is from the Guardian:
‘‘U.S. jobs growth smashes expecta-
tions’’; from CNBC: ‘‘Worker wage
gains just broke 3% for the first time
in more than 10 years’’; from Fox Busi-
ness: ‘‘U.S. employers added 304,000
jobs in January, soaring past expecta-
tions’’; from the Wall Street Journal:
‘‘U.S. Stocks Post Best January in 30
Years’’; from USA Today: ‘‘Employers
add booming 304,000 jobs in January,
marking 100th straight month of em-
ployment gains’’; and from the Associ-
ated Press: ‘‘A robust job gain in Janu-
ary shows US economy’s durability.’’
The list goes on. Simply put, the U.S.
economy is flourishing.
After years of stagnation under the
Obama administration, the economy
has come roaring back. Job creation is
strong, and unemployment is low. Jan-
uary marked the 11th straight month
that unemployment has been at or
below 4 percent. That is the strongest
streak in nearly five decades.
The economy grew at a robust 3.4
percent in the third quarter of 2018. In
2018, for the first time ever, the number
of job openings outnumbered the num-
ber of jobseekers. The Department of
Labor reports that for 9 straight
months there have been more job open-
ings than people looking for work.
Wage growth is accelerating. Wages
have now been growing at a rate of 3
percent or greater for 6 straight
months. The last time wage growth
reached this level was in 2009.
Median household income is at an
all-time inflation-adjusted record of
$6,372.
Small business optimism hit record
highs in 2018. The year 2018 saw the
most impressive job growth in the
manufacturing industry since 1997.
The list goes on and on and on. My
point, very simply, is that Republican
economic policies are working.
When Republicans took office 2 years
ago, the economy had been underper-
forming for years, and American fami-
lies had been feeling the effects. We
were determined to remove the obsta-
cles that were holding the economy
back, like burdensome regulations and
an outdated Tax Code that was acting
as a drag on economic growth. So,
along with the President, we got right
to work, lifting excessive regulations.
In December 2017, we passed a his-
toric, comprehensive reform of our Tax
Code. We cut taxes for American fami-
lies, doubled the child tax credit, and
nearly doubled the standard deduction.
We lowered tax rates across the board
for owners of small and medium-sized
businesses, farms, and ranches. We low-
ered our Nation’s massive corporate
tax rate, which previously was the
highest corporate tax rate in the devel-
oped world. We expanded business own-
ers’ ability to recover the cost of in-
vestments they make in their busi-
nesses, which frees up cash that they
can invest in their operations and in
their workers. And we brought the U.S.
international tax system into the 21st
century so that American businesses
are not operating at a competitive dis-
advantage next to their foreign coun-
terparts.
Now we are seeing the effects: a
thriving economy, good jobs, higher
wages, and low unemployment.
So what is the Democratic response
to all of this good economic news and
economic growth? Is it to continue the
policies that are creating prosperity
for American families and look for
ways for grow these policies to expand
the economic benefits even further?
No.
Democrats want to reverse the poli-
cies that are producing economic
growth. They want to undo the tax
cuts that are creating jobs and oppor-
tunities for American workers, and
they want to increase—increase—the
tax burden of American families.
That is right. Democrats are cur-
rently advocating various proposals
that would not only reverse the gains
the economy has made but would se-
verely damage economic growth for the
long term. For example, there are the
proposals to impose a government-run
healthcare system, like the so-called
Medicare for All plan, whose price tag
is so staggeringly large—by one esti-
mate, more than $32 trillion—that no
one has even come close to figuring out
how to pay for it. Doubling the amount
of individual and corporate income tax
collected would still not be enough to
pay for the mammoth cost of this plan.
Think about that. All of the revenue
collected—income tax on the indi-
vidual side and on the corporate side,
double it—double it—and you still
wouldn’t be able to pay for this mas-
sive, massive plan.
The Democrats’ promise that if you
like your healthcare plan, you can
keep it will be broken again. More than
175 million Americans get their health
insurance through their jobs. That will
be no more under this proposal. The
Vermont Senator’s government-run
Medicare for All plan, which many of
our colleagues on the other side of the
aisle have cosponsored, would elimi-
nate private sector insurance for mil-
lions of families who like the coverage
they currently have.
Then there is the so-called Green
New Deal, which could raise families’
energy bills by more than $3,000 each
year. When I travel in my State of
South Dakota, I hear a lot about the
high cost of living and how it is still
difficult for families to make ends
meet. The last thing my constituents
in South Dakota or any hard-working
family needs is to have their energy
costs go up by more than $3,000 a year.
Then there are the plain old tax bills
that some of the Democrats are pro-
posing to raise the top marginal tax
rate to 70 percent or higher. House
Democrats are also proposing to sub-
stantially increase business tax rates.
Prior to the passage of the tax re-
form, America’s global companies
faced the highest corporate tax rate in
the developed world. That put Amer-
ican businesses at a serious disadvan-
tage on the global stage, which, in
turn, put American workers at a dis-
advantage.
Part of the economic growth that we
are experiencing now and all of the
benefits for workers that come along
with it are direct results of the lower
corporate tax rate that we passed as
part of the tax reform.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S845
February 5, 2019
It is staggering—staggering—that
Democrats can look at all of the bene-
fits that come from lowering the cor-
porate rate and all of the positive ef-
fects it is having on the economy and
workers and then turn around and pro-
pose a tax rate hike.
In short, here is what our country
would look like if the Democrats’ far-
left agenda is forced upon the Amer-
ican people: Government-run Medicare
for All would eliminate employer-spon-
sored insurance for 175 million people,
increase government spending by $32
trillion, jeopardize Medicare for to-
day’s seniors, and raise taxes on just
about everyone under the sun. The
Green New Deal would increase energy
costs by up to $3,000 or more per year
for our families, and Democrats’ new
taxes would slow economic growth, de-
stroy jobs, and reduce economic oppor-
tunity for hard-working Americans.
Our economy is thriving, and that is
bringing real benefits to American
families and to American workers. We
want to continue heading in the right
direction with more policies to grow
the economy, to reduce the cost of liv-
ing, and to help Americans save for re-
tirement. We will strongly oppose
Democrats’ attempts and proposals to
undo the progress that our economy
has made and to burden Americans
with higher taxes, fewer jobs, and fewer
opportunities.

STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as the
world knows by now, tonight President
Trump will deliver his delayed State of
the Union Message.
This is a tradition that, of course,
dates back to the Constitution, but the
Constitution is ambiguous or unclear
or actually doesn’t say exactly how
that annual message should be deliv-
ered. We know that George Wash-
ington, for example, delivered his an-
nual message in 1790 at the Federal
Hall of New York City, which was the
temporary seat of the Federal Govern-
ment at the time. Although John
Adams delivered an in-person address,
the tradition didn’t last very long. Our
third President, Thomas Jefferson,
chose to deliver the message in writ-
ing, a practice that lasted for nearly a
century—that is, until President Wood-
row Wilson chose to speak to the Con-
gress in 1913.
According to the Washington Post,
people were outraged at this breach of
tradition, which maybe speaks to how
hard change is in Washington, DC.
The paper wrote ‘‘All official Wash-
ington was agape last night over the
decision of the President to go back to
the long-abandoned custom.’’
Coming face-to-face with Members of
Congress was President Wilson’s at-
tempt to bring about a closer intimacy
between the Congress and the Chief Ex-
ecutive, and I am glad this time the
tradition has stuck. I know there are
those who disagree, and perhaps that
has to do with the endless wave of
standing ovations that Congress gives
that punctuates the modern speech,
which I could do with less of.
The State of the Union Message also
serves another important purpose, and
that is the President’s ability to speak
not only to the Members of Congress
but over the heads of Congress and di-
rectly to the American people. This ad-
dress is carried live on every network
and streamed across social media plat-
forms.
We are all waiting to hear what the
President has to say, particularly dur-
ing these polarized and unusual times.
This is a time to reflect on the great
work that has been done in the last
couple of years to help move our coun-
try in a positive direction. Unfortu-
nately, given the propensity of the
media to focus on conflict and not on
accomplishment that is credited to bi-
partisan efforts, most of the American
people probably aren’t aware or need to
be reminded of what has actually hap-
pened the last 2 years, and I hope the
President will reflect on that.
President Trump took office in Janu-
ary 2017, and Congress has passed legis-
lation since that time to improve near-
ly every aspect of society. No one
stands out greater than the economy.
I remember that during the Barack
Obama administration, particularly
after the great recession of 2008, we
were told that 2 percent growth was
the new normal, even though for the
last previous 25 years that was defi-
nitely subnormal. Annual growth rates
were more often in the 3.5 to 4 percent
range.
Now we know that the American
economy has gotten its groove back
and people are optimistic and con-
fident. They reacted in large part to
the increase in take-home pay they see
in their paychecks and the fact that
many businesses, large and small, have
chosen to reinvest in their people by
raising wages, improving benefits, or
providing a bonus.
I hope that we hear from President
Trump more about this tonight be-
cause this has been nothing less than a
miracle. You can undoubtedly trace it
back to the landmark tax reform bill
we passed over a year ago.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act sought to
solve a problem that had befuddled
Congress for many years, whether they
be Republicans or Democrats. The
question was, How do we fix this out-
dated, archaic, and overly complicated
Tax Code?
When President Trump signed this
bill into law, it marked the first major
overhaul of our Tax Code in 31 years.
Our reforms lowered rates all across
the board, doubled the child tax credit,
and incentivized U.S. businesses with
earnings abroad to bring that money
back home and work here in America
for the American people. We quickly
saw a steady stream of headlines about
businesses, big and small, announcing,
as I indicated earlier, bonuses, pay
raises, new jobs, and other investments
in their employees.
In the months that followed the law’s
enactment, I have met with a number
of employers throughout Texas to see
how the new tax law has changed their
way of doing business.
In Corpus Christi, for example, I vis-
ited with a seafood distributorship
company called Groomers Seafood.
They gave their employees a bonus and
increased their wages after the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act became law.
In Houston, at Southland Hardware,
a quaint neighborhood hardware store
whose tagline is ‘‘the store that has
‘almost’ everything,’’ they were able to
provide bonuses and raises for their
staff, as well as hire a new employee
and do improvements to their store.
In Austin, I visited with the owner of
Wally’s Burger Express. He told me he
is using the savings from tax reform to
expand his business and create new
jobs.
It is clear to me that businesses
across the country have felt the same
way as these owners of small busi-
nesses did in Texas, and it didn’t take
long for Americans to begin to feel the
benefit.
I have heard from countless of my
constituents about the impact this leg-
islation has had on their daily lives,
and it is all for the better. One of them
was a gentleman from Arlington, TX,
named David. David wrote to me to say
that the company where he is em-
ployed increased the hours people were
able to work. Christmas bonuses in-
creased, too, and the company hired
more people, bought new machines, and
made long-overdue repairs to their
building. Now with these changes in
place, David says the guys down on the
shop floor are taking home a little bit
more money each week in their pay-
checks. He said: ‘‘All of this adds up
and makes a huge difference in the
lives of the guys on the shop floor.’’
The impact also extends to retirees
across the country. One of my con-
stituents from Midland, TX, named
Glenda reached out to me about how
the tax reform bill changed her life.
She wrote to me to say that she has
been retired since 2013, which, she re-
minded me, means that she has a fixed
income with no possibility of pay
raises or year-end bonuses, but that
doesn’t mean she is not grateful. She
said that the reduction in income taxes
to her feels like a raise.
Because of this legislation, middle-
class Americans are living more com-
fortably and the economy is booming.
If you don’t believe me, just look at
the numbers. Since this legislation was
passed, 3 million new jobs have been
added in our country, wages are on the

rise, and unemployment has hit a 50-
year low. I read the other day that be-
cause of tight labor conditions, people
with disabilities are reentering the
workforce, and we have seen the lowest
level of Hispanic and African-American
unemployment ever.
This revitalization of the economy
has led to big benefits on Main Street
and in the homes of average Ameri-
cans. America has regained its status
as an economic powerhouse once again,
and we are going to keep these suc-
cesses going.
So looking back on the last 2 years,
there are countless accomplishments I
am proud of, but certainly reforming
the Tax Code for the first time in 31
years stands out near the top of the
list.
I should also mention that we con-
firmed 85 Federal judges, including two
incredibly qualified Supreme Court
Justices. This all comes despite the un-
precedented obstruction we have seen
from Senate Democrats to slow down
or block the process. We still have a
number of judicial vacancies to fill in
this Congress, many of them in Texas
and many of whom were just renomi-
nated. I hope we can move quickly to
vote on these nominations—these good
men and women who offered to serve
the public as Federal judges.
Under this administration we have
taken some positive bipartisan efforts,
such as combatting the opioid epi-
demic, which plagues nearly every
community in the America. We sup-
ported pay raises for our military and
authorized additional resources for
their equipment and training. We pro-
moted public safety with the passage of
bills to stop or deter school violence.
We have given farmers and ranchers
the certainty they need when we
passed the critical farm bill. We sup-
ported better career training and edu-
cation for American workers. And that
is just the beginning.
This administration, in working with
the Congress, has delivered real
changes for the American people. I am
ready to keep those changes and im-
provements moving forward, so I am
eager to hear what the President has to
say tonight on everything we have ac-
complished together and for him to
outline his priorities for the coming
year.
With the Democrats’ gaining control
of the House, though, I expect the
President to ask about the importance
of working on a bipartisan basis.
Speaker PELOSI has a fundamental
choice: Is she going to work with the
Republicans in the Senate and the
President to do good things for the
American people or is she simply going
to oppose anything and everything
President Trump proposes—given the
fact that the 35-day shutdown rep-
resents not an effort to find middle
ground and negotiate a sensible out-
come but rather one of political point-
scoring, of trying to determine who is
the winner and loser in any particular
battle no matter what the collateral
damage may be?
I hope our colleagues in the House
and, I hope, all of our colleagues in the
Senate will look at trying to continue
this record of accomplishment for the
American people and will commit to
working in good faith to keep that
progress moving.
Under this administration, our gov-
ernment has taken major steps to
strengthen our economy and to make
changes that benefit the American peo-
ple. I am proud of what we have been
able to accomplish. I am not focused on
the frustrations that plague us every
day; I am focused on the positives we
have been able to do, and I hope we can
keep it going.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for

dered.

ator from Louisiana.
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

S. 1
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want
to talk again for a few minutes about
S. 1, which is sponsored by Senator
RUBIO.
As I have cautioned the last few
times I spoke on the subject, nothing I
say is meant to be construed as a criti-
cism of Senator RUBIO. There are some
really good things in this bill, as the
Presiding Officer knows.
I forget the title of it. I think Sen-
ator RUBIO is calling it the Strength-
ening America’s Security in the Middle
East Act. I like the fact that S. 1 reaf-
firms our commitment to protecting
Israel. I think that is important. I
think Israel is certainly our best friend
in the Middle East and one of our best
friends in the world. Some days I think
Israel is our only friend in the world.
S. 1 is going to strengthen America’s
bonds with Jordan, and I think that is
very important. Jordan has been a key
ally in fighting terrorism and, frankly,
a key ally in helping us deal with the
humanitarian catastrophe as a result
of Assad and his butchering of his own
people in Syria.
S. 1 is going to combat a radical eco-
nomic warfare campaign against our
friend Israel. That is long overdue. S. 1
is also going to create new sanctions
on the Government of Syria. I support
all of those. I intend to vote for S. 1,
despite the fact that, in my opinion,
there is a great deficiency with S. 1.
I know Senator MCCONNELL offered
an amendment to reflect the will of the
Senate with respect to whether Amer-
ica ought to get out of Syria. In his
amendment, he suggested that we
should not. I voted against Senator
MCCONNELL’s amendment not because I
think he is wrong but because I just
don’t know if he is right. I don’t think
most Members of Congress know.
We have received such conflicting in-
formation, and I have asked Senator
MCCONNELL to hold a briefing for us—a
classified briefing in which we bring
over people who think we should get
out and people who think we shouldn’t
get out, and let us hear the facts and
the informed opinions of people who
know better than we do. Frankly, I
would like to see us do the same thing
with respect to Afghanistan.
I share the President’s concern about
nation-building. We have spent $6 tril-
lion since 2001 in the Middle East. I
share the President’s concern about
mission creep. But, once again, just as
I am not saying that Senator MCCON-
NELL is wrong; I just don’t know that
he is right, and, quite frankly, I am
saying the same thing with respect to
President Trump. I am not saying he is
wrong about withdrawing from Syria; I
am just saying I don’t know if he is
right.
I do know this: President Trump is
going to do what he thinks is best for
America. The Senate can pass all of the
bills and resolutions about the will of
the Senate that it wants to, but if the
President of the United States thinks
it is best for the American people and
the world to withdraw all troops from
Syria, then my experience is, by God,
he is going to do it.
If he does it, one of my biggest con-
cerns, which could have been addressed
in this bill, is if we would have been al-
lowed to offer amendments, supposedly
as the world’s greatest deliberative
body, we could have fixed this problem.
The problem I am talking about is the
Syrian Kurds.
Let’s just call it like it is. I men-
tioned that Israel has been a great ally,
as well as Jordan. This bill is being
sold as, well, this is to protect our al-
lies in the Middle East, in part. What
about the Syrian Kurds?
I think there are 50 or 60 million
Kurds throughout the world. They are
mostly in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and
Syria. Why aren’t the Kurds allowed to
self-determine?
Even if the Kurds didn’t believe in
democracy—and I think they do; they
want sovereignty like we have, and
they want to be able to self-deter-
mine—the truth is, we wouldn’t have
beaten back ISIS without the help of
the Syrian Kurds.
I don’t want to get off into this dis-
cussion about whether or not ISIS is
defeated. If you look at just the statis-
tics, a couple of years ago, there were
100,000 ISIS jihadists. There are not
100,000 now. There are less than 5,000. A
couple of years ago, ISIS had its own
caliphate. They just went in there and
carved out their own country. They
don’t have it anymore.
So you can debate whether we de-
feated them. I am not sure we will ever

completely defeat the jihadists, wheth-
er they call themselves ISIS or al-
Qaida or what. But I know this much:
We could not have beaten back ISIS
without the help of the Syrian Kurds.
A lot of our other friends said: Yeah,
you go get them. You go fight. We will
be glad to hold your coat while you
fight. That was not the Syrian Kurds.
They got in there with us.
The Syrian Kurds have enemies in
this world. I am not making any accu-
sations or disparaging comments about
our friends in Turkey, but President
Erdogan has been very vocal about how
he feels about the Kurds, including, but
not limited to, the Syrian Kurds. I
worry about them if we leave.
I had an amendment that didn’t re-
quire—it didn’t require—anybody to do
anything. It just said: Mr. President, if
we leave Syria, this will give you the
authority to keep our friends, our al-
lies, the Syrian Kurds, from being
butchered, from being opened up like a
soft peanut.
America’s foreign policy has never
been just about interests; it has been
about values. America’s foreign policy
has always had a moral component.
Part of the moral component in our
foreign policy is that we don’t leave
our friends behind. That is what we are
potentially doing with this bill.
It could have been easily fixed. It
could have been fixed if the Senate had
been allowed to be the U.S. Senate.
I don’t hate anyone. I love and re-
spect all of my colleagues, and I mean
that—even the jurists and everybody in
their own way, especially in this body,
and I have gotten to know all of them,
and I am so proud to be a Member. But
it does bother me sometimes; it seems
we are kind of like—it is almost Or-
wellian. We are all equal, but some of
us are more equal than others, and I
think that irks the American people. I
think had we been able to offer amend-
ments, we could have fixed that prob-
lem with the Syrian Kurds.
I hope I don’t have to come back and
say told you so. I hope after we leave
Syria—and I think the President is
going to leave Syria—I hope the Syrian
Kurds are just fine. I hope they are just
fine. But if they are not, I hope we will
not look back and say that we had a
chance to protect our friends and do
the right thing, but we didn’t do it.
I yield the floor.

DESIGNATING THE OUTSTATION
OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VET-
ERANS AFFAIRS IN NORTH
OGDEN, UTAH, AS THE MAJOR
BRENT TAYLOR VET CENTER
OUTSTATION
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah.
Mr. LEE. Madam President, on No-
vember 3, 2018, this country lost a true
American hero: MAJ Brent Taylor of
Ogden, UT, who gave the ultimate sac-
rifice while deployed in Afghanistan.
As North Ogden’s mayor, Major Tay-
lor died as he lived: going above and be-
yond the call of duty to his country, to
his State, and his family.
Major Taylor, who is pictured here
with his family, began his military
service in 2003, following the attacks of
September 11. He joined the Army Na-
tional Guard just 3 days after becoming
engaged to his wife Jennie.
During his time in the National
Guard, Major Taylor distinguished
himself in multiple specialties, includ-
ing intelligence and military police. In
2006, he received a commission as a sec-
ond lieutenant from the Brigham
Young University ROTC, while grad-
uating as a member of the National So-
ciety of Collegiate Scholars. Major
Taylor was continuously ready to take
up the call to arms and deployed four
times on missions to Iraq and to Af-
ghanistan. He held a variety of roles in
those deployments, including platoon
leader, combat adviser, and chief of
staff to the Special Operations Advi-
sory Group.
Throughout his distinguished tours
of service, he also received several
awards for courage and for leadership,
including a Bronze Star in honor of his
ability to calmly and safely lead those
he was assigned to lead through mul-
tiple miles of treacherous territory and
a Purple Heart for the wounds he re-
ceived during an explosives attack on
his vehicle.
His love of his country and his State
was also very evident, perhaps most
evident beyond the circumstance in
which he wore the uniform. Major Tay-
lor gave his time and his energy to his
community, serving tirelessly as a
member of the North Ogden City Coun-
cil, from 2010 to 2013, and then as the
mayor of North Ogden, after being
elected to that post in 2013. He was
known for being a hands-on leader and
someone who was attentive to and con-
stantly beloved by every member of his
community.
After being reelected as the mayor of
North Ogden in 2017, Major Taylor took
a leave of absence from the mayor’s of-
fice and headed back to the battlefield,
deploying once again to Afghanistan.
When he announced his leave of ab-
sence to the people of North Ogden, he
told them he felt called to serve his
country and that ‘‘service is what lead-
ership is all about.’’
Major Taylor faithfully served his
church and his family too. He had a
deep love of God and of his church. He
was a devoted husband to Jennie and a
loving father to their seven children,
pictured here: Megan, Lincoln, Alex,
Jacob, Ellie, Jonathan, and Caroline.
Following his tragic passing, in an
attack on November 3 of this last year,
Major Abdul Rahmani, an Afghani
pilot with whom Major Taylor worked,
sent a letter to Major Taylor’s wife
Jennie, describing the great impact
Major Taylor had on his life. He said:
‘‘Your husband taught me to love my
wife [Hamida] as an equal and treat my
children as treasured gifts, to be a bet-
ter father, to be a better husband, and
to be a better man.’’
Further, he said: Major Taylor ‘‘died
on our soil, but he died for the success
of freedom and democracy in both our
countries.’’
In every aspect of his life, Major Tay-
lor was a shining example of patriot-
ism, of sacrifice, and of service. It is
only right that we honor his extraor-
dinary life. To that end, it would only
be a fitting tribute to rename the
Ogden Veterans Center in Utah as the
Major Brent Taylor Vet Center
Outstation.
Today Jennie Taylor is joining Con-
gressman ROB BISHOP as his honored
guest for the State of the Union Ad-
dress tonight, to honor Major Taylor’s
life and to honor his great legacy—the
legacy he leaves behind to his family,
to his community, and to all who knew
him and served with him. I urge my
colleagues to pass legislation com-
memorating that.
Madam President, I ask unanimous
consent that the Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of S. 49 and the Sen-
ate proceed to its immediate consider-
ation.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the bill by title.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read as follows:
A bill (S. 49) to designate the outstation of
the Department of Veterans Affairs in North
Ogden, Utah, as the Major Brent Taylor Vet
Center Outstation.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Thereupon, the committee was dis-
charged, and the Senate proceeded to
consider the bill.
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the bill be
considered read a third time and passed
and that the motion to reconsider be
considered made and laid upon the
table.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
The bill (S. 49) was ordered to be en-
grossed for a third reading, was read
the third time, and passed, as follows:

his wife, Jennie. Five of his brothers would
eventually serve in the Armed Forces fol-
lowing the deadly attacks.
(2) During his time in the Army National
Guard, Major Taylor distinguished himself in
service to the United States and the State of
Utah. He received a commission as a second
lieutenant from the Brigham Young Univer-
sity Reserve Officer Training Corps in 2006,
while graduating as a member of the Na-
tional Society of Collegiate Scholars.
(3) During his impressive career with the
Utah National Guard, Major Taylor distin-
guished himself in multiple specialties, in-
cluding Intelligence and Military Police. One
of his earliest assignments included ana-
lyzing foreign language documents in sup-
port of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He
also led document exploitation efforts in
multiple European and South American lan-
guages for a variety of intelligence commu-
nity customers. Major Taylor also managed
a team that assessed security vulnerabilities
at high-profile facilities across the United
States, all while maintaining a successful
private sector career in Utah.
(4) Major Taylor was continuously ready to
take up a call to arms from the United
States and deployed four times in support of
operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. His de-
ployed duties varied from Platoon Leader
and Combat Advisor to Chief of Staff to the
Special Operations Advisory Group, respon-
sible for leading a joint task force advising
and assisting an elite Afghan special oper-
ations unit.
(5) Throughout his deployments, Major
Taylor distinguished himself on several oc-
casions, earning a multitude of awards in-
cluding the Bronze Star. The citation credits
the ability of Major Taylor to think calmly
and decisively to keep his subordinates safe
while traversing 600,000 miles of roads in
Iraq, laden with improvised explosive devices
(commonly referred to as ‘‘IED’’) and ripe for
ambush.
(6) During one particularly harrowing mis-
sion, Major Taylor’s vehicle was struck by
an IED. Although he survived the attack, the
wounds he received earned him the Purple
Heart.
(7) Major Taylor’s amazing record of serv-
ice was not limited to the battlefield. In 2010,
he served as a member of the North Ogden
City Council and, in 2013, Major Taylor was
elected mayor. His steadfast leadership led
to the city being recognized as ‘‘Business
Friendly’’ by the Governor of Utah, and as
one of the safest, freest cities in the United
States by several organizations. His initia-
tives included improvements to public works
and infrastructure, attracting businesses to
the area, developing a local community cen-
ter, and increasing transparency. His action
led his constituents to reelect Major Taylor
in 2017.
(8) In 2018, Major Taylor placed himself on
a leave of absence from his mayoral duties in
order to deploy to Afghanistan, explaining to
his constituents, ‘‘Service is what leadership
is all about.’’.
(9) While serving in Afghanistan, a dear
colleague, Afghani Lieutenant Kefayatullah,
was killed shortly before the Afghan elec-
tions. Major Taylor wrote, ‘‘The strong turn-
out at that election, despite the attacks and
challenges, was a success for the long-suf-
fering people of Afghanistan, and for the
cause of human freedom. I am proud of the
brave Afghan and U.S. soldiers I serve with.
Many American, NATO and Afghan troops
have died to make moments like this elec-
tion possible.’’. He also extolled the Amer-
ican public to embrace its civic duty, stat-
ing, ‘‘I hope everyone back home exercises
their precious right to vote. And that wheth-
er the Republicans or Democrats win, that
we all remember that we have far more as
Americans that unites us than divides us.’’.
(10) Tragically, on Saturday, November 3,
2018, Major Taylor was killed in an attack in
Afghanistan. He was survived by his wife,
Jennie, and his seven children, Megan, Lin-
coln, Alex, Jacob, Ellie, Jonathan, and Caro-
line.
(11) The impression that Major Taylor left
was indelible. An Afghan officer who had
served with Major Taylor penned a letter to
his wife, stating, ‘‘Your husband taught me
to love my wife Hamida as an equal and
treat my children as treasured gifts, to be a
better father, to be a better husband, and to
be a better man.’’. That officer further com-
mented that, ‘‘He died on our soil but he died
for the success of freedom and democracy in
both of our countries.’’.
(12) It is only well and fitting that, as a
tribute to the amazing life of Major Taylor,
Congress name a facility in honor of Major
Taylor’s shining example of service and sac-
rifice.
SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF MAJOR BRENT TAYLOR
VET CENTER OUTSTATION IN NORTH
OGDEN, UTAH.
(a) DESIGNATION.—The outstation of the
Department of Veterans Affairs located at
2357 North 400 East Washington Boulevard,
North Ogden, Utah, shall after the date of
the enactment of this Act be known and des-
ignated as the ‘‘Major Brent Taylor Vet Cen-
ter Outstation’’.
(b) REFERENCE.—Any reference in any law,
regulation, map, document, paper, or other
record of the United States to the facility re-
ferred to in subsection (a) shall be considered
to be a reference to the Major Brent Taylor
Vet Center Outstation.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky.
S.1.
Mr. PAUL. Madam President, our
country was founded upon the concept
and in the midst of a great boycott. At
the time, we were boycotting British
goods and, most specifically, British
tea. There is likely nothing more
American than to protest, to dissent,
and to boycott.
In fact, our Founding Fathers—many
of them, including Sam Adams and the
Sons of Liberty—gathered in 1773,
dressed as Indians, and dumped 90,000
pounds of British tea into the harbor.
Some of our Founding Fathers were ac-
tually involved with trying to smuggle
and import Dutch tea to get around the
rules and to get around having to be so
dependent on England.
But this was a boycott. The sad thing
today is that we will be debating
whether or not to place limitations on
the First Amendment right to boycott,
and we will do it because the vast ma-
jority of this body disagrees with the
concept of what the people are boy-
cotting over.
I would argue that it doesn’t matter
what the issue is. In fact, the First
Amendment is to protect issues of
speech and issues of boycott that you
may disagree with.
I am not particularly enamored
with—in fact, I don’t favor—the boy-
cott of Israel. I think Israel has been a
good ally. Yet the freedom of speech,
the freedom of the press, the freedom
to protest, and the freedom to boycott
are fundamentally American. How can
we give that up so easily? How can we
just say: Oh, well, it is a good ally, and
we don’t want anybody boycotting
them. We are just going to amend the
First Amendment because we don’t
like this boycott.
Our Founding Fathers would roll
over in their graves if they knew what
we were doing today.
I stand today at Henry Clay’s desk.
This desk has been passed down to the
Senator from Kentucky ever since he
left the Senate in 1850. In 1809, before
he arrived here, there was a boycott of
British goods. In fact, there was an of-
ficial embargo that Jefferson had put
on when we were upset with what the
British were doing on the high seas
with confiscating our ships, and we de-
cided to have an organized embargo, a
boycott.
In Kentucky, Henry Clay was still in
the State legislature, and he proposed
a rule saying that the legislators them-
selves should not wear British cloth-
ing. It was opposed by a guy named
Humphrey Marshall, who was a cousin
of the fourth Chief Justice John Mar-
shall. They got into heated words, at
which time Henry Clay, wearing his
American homespun clothing, was con-
fronted by Humphrey Marshall, who
came in wearing what was described as
garish English imports, and he called
Henry Clay a demagogue for passing
this legislation.
Well, Henry Clay gave it right back
and called him a liar, at which point
the words accelerated, and they were
about to come to blows when a massive
6-foot-6-inch German-American legis-
lator jumped in between them and
stopped the fight from ensuing on the
floor.
Henry cooled down. Henry Clay de-
cided to apologize. He apologizes to the
body and gives his apology, and Mar-
shall jumps up and shouts back, ‘‘It is
the apology of a poltroon,’’ which is an
old-fashioned word for coward.
Things didn’t get much better after
that, and Henry Clay challenged him to
a duel. It was illegal—and still is ille-
gal—to have a duel in Kentucky. So
they went across the river in Louisville
and fought a duel, at which time Henry
Clay was wounded in the thigh.
In those days, even though the laws
were against dueling, you were often
rewarded for dueling by getting a pro-
motion. So the State legislature, with-
in a week or two, elected Henry Clay to
go to the U.S. Senate to represent
them.
So not only are boycotts a big part of
our history, but this particular boycott
actually elevated Henry Clay to the
U.S. Senate to become one of the most
famous Senators in our history.
As for other famous boycotts, there
was a boycott of the buses in Mont-
gomery in 1955 and 1956. The boycott
went on for 382 days. It was set off, as
you will recall, by Rosa Parks’ refusing
to be seated in the back of the bus. But
this boycott was about speech, and it
was about law, and it was about jus-
tice.
Now, people would say: Well, I agreed
with that boycott. That is OK. It is OK

to have good boycotts that I agree
with, but it is not OK to have boycotts
I disagree with.
I will make this argument. If today
this body votes to encourage this idea
that legislatively we should penalize
people who boycott, I will argue today
that—guess what—if you can penalize
boycotts you disagree with, you may
well find some day that people are pe-
nalizing boycotts that you agree with.
If you have the power to disallow boy-
cotts you don’t like, you are now
granting to the government the power
to ban boycotts that you may well
like.
The thing is this: Should the major-
ity get to decide, well, that is a good
boycott and that is a bad boycott, and
you can say certain types of speech as
long as I agree with you?
No, the freedom of speech—the First
Amendment—is about allowing lan-
guage you don’t like. It is about allow-
ing boycotts you may not like.
If you go through our history, our
history is replete with boycotts, from
the Boston Tea Party to the boycott
around the War of 1812 of British goods,
to the bus boycott in Montgomery—
boycott after boycott. It is a funda-
mental aspect of the First Amendment.
You don’t believe me? Listen to the
Supreme Court. In NAACP vs. Clai-
borne Hardware, Blacks were pro-
testing a Whites-only store that
wouldn’t allow service or allow sales to
Blacks. They boycotted the store, and
guess what. The Supreme Court said, 8
to 0, that you can boycott, particularly
if your boycott is based on speech or it
is based on a political viewpoint.
Now, while I don’t agree with people
who want to boycott Israel, if you live
in our country, or wherever you live,
and you don’t like their policies, do
you not have a right to boycott? Are
we somehow going to take away your
right to boycott because we disagree
with what you are boycotting over?
I have a short list here of a few dif-
ferent things that we have boycotted
over, and they range, interestingly, on
both sides of the coin. Most recently,
people on the left who don’t like Presi-
dent Trump have boycotted Ivanka
Trump’s fashion brand.
A year or two ago, Christians boy-
cotted Disney over what they consid-
ered to be liberal movies or movies
they didn’t appreciate because of the
families depicted.
In North Carolina, liberals boycotted
the North Carolina transgender bath-
room law.
People have boycotted Chick-fil-A
because the CEO was opposed to same-
sex marriage.
The Dixie Chicks criticized George
W. Bush, and they were boycotted.
It doesn’t matter whether you agree
with any of these boycotts. Boycotts
are speech. How could we possibly boy-
cott someone’s speech? But that is
what is going on.
About 20 States have passed these
laws, and what we are now considering
before our body is putting our impri-
matur—our stamp of approval—which
we are going to put on these States
that are penalizing boycotts.
So who are some of the people that
we are going to penalize?
In Texas, there is a speech patholo-
gist who has lost her job. She was
working for the school system. She has
been in this country 30 years. Her name
is Bahia Amawai. She has been here 30
years. She is a U.S. citizen. She speaks
three languages. She works with chil-
dren with autism, disabilities, and
speech impediments.
Her contract was not renewed be-
cause they told her she had to sign a
pledge that she will not boycott Israel.
She also had to sign a pledge that she
would never do anything economically
or refrain from any action—buying a
product—with anyone who does busi-
ness in Israel or does business in an
area they call the Israeli-controlled
territory.
There has been a dispute for 30 or 40
years over the West Bank, whether the
Palestinians should have more auton-
omy, whether it should be a country,
whether it should be a province of
Israel, whether they should vote,
whether they should not vote. This is a
political debate.
This woman has an opinion that she
doesn’t want to sign this pledge. She
no longer works.
We heard on the floor from one of my
colleagues yesterday. He said: Well, it
is the government’s money. The gov-
ernment’s money shouldn’t be used to
allow a boycott.
Well, if you are a teacher and you get
a salary, is that still the government’s
money after you have done your job
and you have your paycheck? Should a
teacher be prevented from boycotting
or expressing their speech through an
economic action or, really, through an
economic inaction by not buying some-
thing?
It is the whole idea of ‘‘not.’’ A boy-
cott is not even doing anything. A boy-
cott is refusing to buy someone’s prod-
uct.
How could we possibly be in favor of
that? How could we have such clouded
judgment that this body, which has
such historic importance, is going to
vote to place a ban on freedom of
speech? How could that possibly hap-
pen in our country?
This woman has been denied her job.
It is her main job. She worked for the
school district. She had a contract. Her
contract has been denied because she
refuses to sign a pledge saying she will
not buy a product from somebody that
she disagrees with politically.
How did we get here? How can we
possibly even be considering such ab-
surd limitations on the First Amend-
ment?
This one is even worse. In Arkansas,
the newspaper, the Arkansas Times,
routinely takes ads. That is how news-
papers make money. One of the groups
that advertises with them is the State
university. The State university will
no longer advertise with this news-
paper unless they fine them first or
give them some kind of penalty. They
will not advertise with them unless the
newspaper signs a statement saying
that they will not be critical of policies
in Israel.
How could we possibly say to a news-
paper that you can’t do business with
the State if you criticize a policy in
Israel? How could that possibly be the
American way?
The vast majority of the people here,
like sheep, will fall all over themselves
today to vote to try to limit your right
to boycott.
People say you don’t have a right to
a job, but what if you are with a State?
What if you are a teacher and that is
whom you have always worked for and
you have worked for the government?
Can we start placing rules because the
government pays you on what your po-
litical viewpoint is?
Arkansas says: Well, the newspaper
can do it, but they would have to pay
a 20-percent penalty.
So if you have certain viewpoints or
you refuse to bow down to the govern-
ment and bow down to the opinion the
government tells you is appropriate,
we will let you work for the govern-
ment, but you get penalized 20 percent.
Imagine when this becomes another
view, when this becomes some other
issue you are interested in. Probably
the most famous boycott in history
other than the Montgomery bus boy-
cott over segregation was the anti-
apartheid boycott that ultimately led
to a change of government and a
change of policy. That wasn’t done
with automatic weapons. That wasn’t
done with tanks. That wasn’t done
with planes and bombs. That was done
by good old-fashioned protest, peaceful
protest, by agreeing not to buy some-
thing.
Can you imagine the State is putting
into place laws that punish you for not
buying something, for refusing to buy
something from someone? It is galling.
Will this be declared unconstitutional?
Nobody knows for sure other than the
men and women of the Supreme Court,
but in NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware,
eight to zero they said it was unconsti-
tutional to ban or limit any boycott if
that boycott is about speech or polit-
ical views. Well, clearly that is what
this is about—political views.
In two of the States that have passed
these laws—Kansas and Arizona—there
have already been protests and court
cases.
In Kansas, there is a woman by the
name of Esther Koontz. She is a Men-
nonite, and she is a math teacher. She
has been a math teacher for about a
decade. She has a contract with the
school system to teach other teachers
about teaching math and science. She
said she couldn’t in good conscience
sign a pledge saying she would never
boycott any group who originated out
of Israel. What happened to her? She
was fired or she couldn’t continue in
the job she had been in for I think a
decade. Her case went to court. Guess

what. The court said it is unconstitu-
tional. You cannot limit behavior. You
cannot limit employment with the gov-
ernment based on one’s political views.
So on the first challenge, it was struck
down as unconstitutional.
We go to Arizona. For political rea-
sons, Mikkel Jordahl boycotts con-
sumer goods made in Israel. This is
America. You don’t have to agree with
what he is doing, but in America, you
have the right to protest. You have the
right to boycott. For 12 years, he has
been doing legal services for the local
county jail. They brought in his con-
tract, and in his contract, they said:
You have to pledge that you will no
longer support any activities that
agree with your political viewpoint
that you don’t like Israel’s policy. He
went to court. Guess what the court
said. The law is unconstitutional.
These laws have gone to Federal
court twice—once in Kansas and once
in Arizona—and have been struck
down. So what is this august body
going to do? We are going to take it
right up, and we are going to say: By
golly, keep passing these unconstitu-
tional laws in the States. We got your
back.
It has already been struck down
twice by two Federal district courts.
The Supreme Court has said that the
concept of limiting boycotts is uncon-
stitutional. The First Amendment says
that Congress can’t pass a law limiting
speech, and here, we are going to pass
a law encouraging the limitation of
speech.
One of the famous boycotts was obvi-
ously the Montgomery bus boycott.
The anti-apartheid boycotts were fa-
mous as well, but even if you go fur-
ther back in our history to about the
time of the Boston Tea Party and be-
yond—another boycott—you find that
people were boycotting the slave trade.
There were people boycotting buying
sugar out of the Caribbean because
they didn’t want to have any of that
money going to supporting the slave
trade.
I would argue that the right to boy-
cott is about as fundamental a right as
we have in America. It is a big part of
the First Amendment. It is an impor-
tant part of the First Amendment. It is
a fundamental aspect of freedom to be
able to dissent, to protest, even when
everybody thinks you are wrong. That
is what America is about—that you
have the right to protest and that the
government will not squelch your
speech.
How did we get to this point where
flippantly today we are going to en-
courage States to put limitations on
the First Amendment? I don’t know
how we got here.
When we look at the First Amend-
ment—and some will say: Well, you
know, this is just the State govern-
ment. We are just allowing States’
rights.
Well, here is the thing about States’
rights: Ever since the civil rights era,
we have decided that the Bill of Rights
applies to the States. The 14th Amend-
ment, going all the way back to the
time of the Civil War, incorporated the
1st Amendment. Many of the boycotts
have actually been in favor of civil
rights. Just because this one is a boy-
cott about something else that you
may or may not like or may or may
not support doesn’t mean we should
place limitations on it.
If we begin to do this—it is a road
that some may say is paved with good
intentions—we will be headed toward a
time where speech will be regulated by
our government, where the idea of dis-
sent and the idea of protest will be
judged on whether people think or the
majority of the body thinks that the
protest is in order, whether the major-
ity of the body thinks you should be al-
lowed to protest. How un-American. I
can’t think of anything more un-Amer-
ican than trying to limit the ideas and
actions of a boycott.
I remember when I was in college,
the women of the Southern Baptist
Convention said they didn’t like porno-
graphic magazines out in the open
where kids could see them. They didn’t
even ask the legislature for a law. They
actually did better than asking the leg-
islature for a law; they simply marched
out in front of all the convenience
stores. They did it for about a month.
Guess what. Convenience stores de-
cided they didn’t like people protesting
and everybody talking about them, so
they put the magazines behind the
counter. That is the American way.
Nobody forced them to do it; they did
it under public protest and public pres-
sure.
The idea that we want to pass a law
today that says to the States: Oh, we
like the First Amendment, but if we
don’t like what they are saying and we
don’t like what they are protesting, it
is OK to punish these people. It is OK
to say to the woman in Texas who feels
very strongly about this issue in Israel
that she can’t be employed anymore by
the school district because of her polit-
ical views.
I can’t imagine that this is isn’t
going to be struck down by the Su-
preme Court. In NAACP v. Claiborne
Hardware, the Supreme Court was
unanimous—eight to zero.
How did we get here?
I would say that I hope my col-
leagues will listen to the debate and
that there will be a spirited debate on
the First Amendment, but don’t hold
your breath. You can see there is no
one here other than me. They won’t lis-
ten. The hope is that the American
people will listen and say: How did we
vote to send people to Washington who
are so careless with the Constitution
that they are willing to vote to ban
boycotting, that they are willing to
vote for something that has already
been struck down by two Federal dis-
trict courts, something that has al-
ready been ruled on by the U.S. Su-
preme Court, and they are going to go
ahead and vote anyway because they
don’t like this particular boycott?
The First Amendment isn’t about
popular speech; the First Amendment
is about protecting unpopular speech.
My hope is that across America, peo-
ple are listening and that they will call
their representatives today, call their
Senators and say: How could you? How
dare you take the First Amendment,
crumple it up, and say ‘‘Oh, today we
are going to limit the First Amend-
ment to only boycotts we approve of.
We are going to limit it to speech we
approve of.’’ What a disgrace. What a
terrible day in our history, that we are
going to take the First Amendment,
crumple it up, stomp on it, and simply
say: Oh, we are afraid of that speech, so
we are going to ban it.
I think it has the opposite effect. I
think it only encourages the protest.
What I would say to my colleagues is,
think long and hard today before you
vote to place limitations on the First
Amendment.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—AMENDMENT
NO. 103
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, in a
few moments, the Senate will vote on
S. 1, the Strengthening America’s Se-
curity in the Middle East Act.
This legislation contains several im-
portant bills to enhance defense co-
operation with our partners who share
the goal of fighting terrorism and pro-
moting peace and prosperity.
For example, the bill includes the
U.S.-Jordan Defense Cooperation Ex-
tension Act, which extends an existing
defense cooperation program with Jor-
dan that is set to expire later this year.
In the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee this morning, we heard from the
Commander of U.S. Central Command
responsible for the Middle East, GEN
Joseph Votel. He testified:
Jordan is one of our most committed part-
ners in the Middle East and one of the most
critical voices of modern Islam in the region.
We must be careful to not take this vital
partnership for granted.
Jordan hosts over 750,000 refugees and
contributes to the fight against ISIS.
This bill will enhance our cooperation,
while enhancing security and sup-
porting vital humanitarian efforts
being conducted by this very important
American ally.
The legislation also includes the Cae-
sar Syria Civilian Protection Act. This
bill is named after a Syrian Army de-
fector who exposed photographs of tor-
ture and execution by the Syrian re-
gime. His photos are evidence of the
war crimes and extensive human rights
abuses committed by Bashar al-Assad.
The Caesar bill will impose sanctions
on individuals who support Assad.
These sanctions will limit the ability
of the Assad government to attack in-
nocent civilians.
However, the bill before us is not per-
fect. I am concerned by title IV of this
package. Title IV should have had a
full debate in the Banking Committee
before it ever reached the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S851
February 5, 2019
I believe there are serious questions
about how this bill will impact the
First Amendment rights of individuals
who contract with State or local gov-
ernments in a professional capacity but
choose to boycott Israel in their per-
sonal capacity. These questions are
even more complicated when the indi-
vidual in question is a sole proprietor,
a member of a small firm, or is receiv-
ing a small State contract.
Many of these questions are the re-
sult of the manner in which State and
local governments have designed and
implemented disclosure requirements.
That is why I have introduced an
amendment, Peters No. 103, which
would limit application of State and
local government laws related to con-
tracting.
This amendment would not allow a
State or local government to enforce
measures to restrict contracting with
firms of 10 or fewer employees, con-
tracts with a value of $100,000 or less,
or any contract with a sole proprietor.
This amendment would clarify that
it is not the intention of the bill to re-
strict the First Amendment right of
any individual to protest—including
through boycott—in their personal ca-
pacity.
Madam President, I ask unanimous
consent to set aside the pending
amendment, that amendment No. 103
be reported by number, and that the
amendment be agreed to without inter-
vening action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho.
Mr. RISCH. Madam President, reserv-
ing the right to object, first of all, I
want to agree with my distinguished
colleague and friend from Michigan as
to almost everything he said, with the
exception of article IV.
This BDS provision is a really impor-
tant provision, and I understand what
he is attempting to do with the exemp-
tions. I understand he is putting them
in for the small businesses, but having
said that, we really believe this should
apply across the board. Once we start
the exempting process, it is going to be
very difficult to stop. So given that, I
object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I am
incredibly disappointed that we could
not include my amendment today.
I believe this is an important issue
and that it must be clarified. Ulti-
mately, because of the many other
critical provisions included in this bill
related to foreign policy in the Middle
East, I will support this bill today, but
I also understand it is unlikely that
the House of Representatives will ad-
dress this bill in its current form.
I am sending a letter to the House of
Representatives explaining my con-
cerns with title IV, and I encourage
them to adopt the provisions of my
amendment that I attempted to put
forward today.
With that, I would also like to yield
some time to my colleague from Michi-
gan.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan.
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I
am very proud to be a cosponsor of the
Peters amendment, as well as other
amendments that Senator PETERS has
put forward, and I thank him very
much for his leadership.
To me, this is common sense. I am
very disappointed that this will not be
included in this bill. I will join Senator
PETERS in advocating in the House for
this clarification and other changes
that will make it very clear about an
individual’s right to be able to have
freedom of speech in all of its forms.
It is very unfortunate today that we
could not have adopted this common-
sense approach that would have made
this bill, I think, stronger than it is
now.
I thank Senator PETERS for his hard
work on this.
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I
yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho.
Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I rise
to complete, I hope, the lengthy work
we have done on S. 1—the first bill we
introduced this year.
It is from the Foreign Relations
Committee, and it is a bipartisan piece
of legislation which many people have
had input into. It is a conglomerate of
several pieces of legislation that we
have worked on for a considerable pe-
riod of time, and all of those I know
are supported in a bipartisan way.
I would like to walk through the five
parts of this very briefly. The first one,
of course, is the United States-Israel
Security Authorization Assistance Act
of 2019. That is one we spent a consider-
able period of time on.
Without a doubt, Israel is one of the
best friends we have in the world. Cer-
tainly, in the neighborhood they live
in, which is a very dangerous neighbor-
hood, they need our help. We work with
them very closely in many respects—in
many national security respects, with
people who aren’t out in the public
realm and who will probably never be
out in the public realm, but they are
important for the security of Israel.
The second is the Jordan Defense Au-
thorization Act. I think all of us are
aware, again, that Jordan is a great
friend to have in the Middle East. Like
Israel, it lives in a very dangerous
neighborhood. Jordan has stood by us
through thick and thin and through
many challenges we have had. Jordan
also has, in its great humanitarian
view, taken in a number of refugees
there.
As we work with Jordan, it is a coop-
erative effort to help them as they sus-
tain these populations of displaced peo-
ple who hopefully will be able to return
at some point in time.
Thirdly, the Caesar Syria Civilian
Protection Act of 2019 is also included
in this piece of legislation. This is a
piece of legislation that I think my
friend from Michigan described quite
aptly. It is named after an individual
who is very brave and who brought out
a lot of evidence of acts that people
knew and suspected were happening.
He brought them out into the public.
This is a bill that will use America’s
power to sanction, and it will refresh
some of the sanctions we have already
put in place. It is just an excellent way
to attempt to persuade Bashar al-Assad
that he is going in a very wrong direc-
tion, hurting his people as he is.
The Combating BDS Act of 2019 is an
act that has some controversy to it.
Again, the goals have already been dis-
cussed on the floor for many days and
at considerable length. Without going
into all of the details, it is designed to
see that the BDS activity is tamped
down and that it is not appropriate to
use against our friend Israel.
Lastly, the most recent addition, of
course, was the McConnell amendment
that has been added. This amendment
has been badly mischaracterized by the
national media for a number of days
now.
I keep reading where the national
media writes that the U.S. Senate re-
buked—they used the word ‘‘re-
buked’’—President Trump. Nothing
could be further from the truth.
In fact, when President Trump was
running for office, he said his bottom
line was to attempt to get us out of
some of these entanglements that we
have had.
One, of course, is Afghanistan, which
has been on our mind for 17 years. The
other was Syria. He rolled out the idea
that we shouldn’t be considering that.
This system worked exactly the way
the Founding Fathers intended for it to
work. When it comes to foreign rela-
tions, when it comes to these kind of
matters, it is a joint operation between
the first and the second branches of
government—between the legislative
and the executive branches of govern-
ment.
After the President put this on the
table as the leader of the Nation, peo-
ple began to talk. It was greatly de-
bated both in this body—in the U.S.
Senate—in the House of Representa-
tives, and within the administration
itself. What has happened with this
piece of legislation is, first of all, it
commends the President for all of the
things he has been able to do in Syria
and getting ISIS contained to a very
small area that remains. It also lays
out the challenges we face and com-
mits to joining the President as we go
forward and as we continue the work
that is ahead of us in the Middle East.
This is a great piece of legislation. I
commend it to my fellow Senators.
I yield the floor.

lowing findings:
(1) The foreign terrorist organization al
Qaeda, responsible for the attacks of Sep-
tember 11, 2001, maintains a presence in Af-
ghanistan.
(2) The Islamic State of Iraq and al Sham,
better known by its acronym ISIS, flour-
ished in the chaos unleashed by the civil war
in Syria and at one point controlled exten-
sive territory in Iraq and Syria.
(3) Al Qaeda, ISIS, and their affiliates have
murdered thousands of innocent civilians.
(4) Al Qaeda, ISIS, and their affiliates have
proven resilient and have regrouped when
the United States and its partners have
withdrawn from the fight against them.
(b) SENSE OF SENATE.—The Senate—
(1) acknowledges that the United States
military and our partners have made signifi-
cant progress in the campaign against al
Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and al
Sham (ISIS), and honors the contributions
and sacrifice of the members of the United
States Armed Forces who have served on the
front lines of this fight;
(2) recognizes the continuing threat to the
homeland and our allies posed by al Qaeda
and ISIS, which maintain an ability to oper-
ate in Syria and Afghanistan;
(3) expresses concern that Iran has sup-
ported the Taliban in Afghanistan and
Hizballah and the Assad regime in Syria, and
has sought to frustrate diplomatic efforts to
resolve conflicts in these two countries;
(4) recognizes the positive role the United
States and its partners have played in Syria
and Afghanistan fighting terrorist groups,
countering Iranian aggression, deterring the
further use of chemical weapons, and pro-
tecting human rights;
(5) warns that a precipitous withdrawal of
United States forces from the on-going fight
against these groups, without effective,
countervailing efforts to secure gains in
Syria and Afghanistan, could allow terror-
ists to regroup, destabilize critical regions,
and create vacuums that could be filled by
Iran or Russia, to the detriment of United
States interests and those of our allies;
(6) recognizes that al Qaeda and ISIS pose
a global threat, which merits increased
international contributions to the counter-
terrorism, diplomatic, and stabilization ef-
forts underway in Syria and Afghanistan;
(7) recognizes that diplomatic efforts to se-
cure peaceful, negotiated solutions to the
conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan are nec-
essary to long-term stability and counterter-
rorism efforts in the Middle East and South
Asia;
(8) acknowledges the progress made by
Special Representative Khalilzad in his ef-
forts to promote reconciliation in Afghani-
stan;
(9) calls upon the Administration to con-
duct a thorough review of the military and
diplomatic strategies in Syria and Afghani-
stan, including an assessment of the risk
that withdrawal from those countries could
strengthen the power and influence of Russia
and Iran in the Middle East and South Asia
and undermine diplomatic efforts toward ne-
gotiated, peaceful solutions;
(10) requests that the Administration, as
part of this review, solicit the views of
Israel, our regional partners, and other key
troop-contributing nations in the fight
against al Qaeda and ISIS;
(11) reiterates support for international
diplomatic efforts to facilitate peaceful, ne-
gotiated resolutions to the on-going conflicts
in Syria and Afghanistan on terms that re-
spect the rights of innocent civilians and
deny safe havens to terrorists;
(12) calls upon the Administration to pur-
sue a strategy that sets the conditions for
the long-term defeat of al Qaeda and ISIS, as
well as the protection of regional partners
and allies, while ensuring that Iran cannot
dominate the region or threaten Israel;
(13) encourages close collaboration be-
tween the Executive Branch and the Legisla-
tive Branch to ensure continuing strong, bi-
partisan support for United States military
operations in Syria and Afghanistan; and
(14) calls upon the Administration to cer-
tify that conditions have been met for the
enduring defeat of al Qaeda and ISIS before
initiating any significant withdrawal of
United States forces from Syria or Afghani-
stan.
(c) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in
this section shall be construed as a declara-
tion of war or an authorization of the use of
military force.

NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGE-
MENT ACT—MOTION TO PROCEED
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President,
this next vote is one to invoke cloture
on the motion to proceed to S. 47. This
is the Natural Resources Management
Act. This is our long-talked-about bi-
partisan lands package.
We have a measure in front of us that
is composed of over 100 smaller lands,
resources, and water bills. We have in-
cluded priorities from up to 50 Senators
here in this body; 90 of you have co-
sponsored.
We reauthorized the Land and Water
Conservation Fund. We addressed
sportsmen’s priorities. We have a wide
range of land exchanges and convey-
ances and boundary modifications,
water provisions. It creates new eco-
nomic opportunities and improves the
management of our Federal lands.
We will be talking more about this in
the next couple of days, but I encour-
age all Members to support us on this
very, very important lands package.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia.
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President,
first of all, I want to echo what my col-
league said. Senator CANTWELL has
worked hard the last 2 years or 3 years
on this process.
The lands bill was recently—
The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time
has expired.
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1
minute.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. MANCHIN. I am just saying that
this is a piece of legislation that has
been worked on for quite some time. It
is a piece of legislation that basically
does an awful lot for an awful lot of
people all over this country.
Every one of us has something in this
that is good. Land and water conserva-
tion is basically reauthorized perma-
nently. It is something that we worked
hard on.
I appreciate all of the hard work, and
thank you so much, Madam President.
CLOTURE MOTION
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant
to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the
Senate the pending cloture motion,

COMMITTEE ON FINANCE
I. RULES OF PROCEDURE
Rule 1. Regular Meeting Days.—The regular
meeting day of the committee shall be the
second and fourth Tuesday of each month,
except that if there be no business before the
committee the regular meeting shall be
omitted.
Rule 2. Committee Meetings.—(a) Except as
provided by paragraph 3 of Rule XXVI of the
Standing Rules of the Senate (relating to
special meetings called by a majority of the
committee) and subsection (b) of this rule,
committee meetings, for the conduct of busi-
ness, for the purpose of holding hearings, or
for any other purpose, shall be called by the
chairman after consultation with the rank-
ing minority member. Members will be noti-
fied of committee meetings at least 48 hours
in advance, unless the chairman determines
that an emergency situation requires a
meeting on shorter notice. The notification
will include a written agenda together with
materials prepared by the staff relating to
that agenda. After the agenda for a com-
mittee meeting is published and distributed,
no nongermane items may be brought up
during that meeting unless at least two-
thirds of the members present agree to con-
sider those items.
(b) In the absence of the chairman, meet-
ings of the committee may be called by the
ranking majority member of the committee
who is present, provided authority to call
meetings has been delegated to such member
by the chairman.
Rule 3. Presiding Officer.—(a) The chairman
shall preside at all meetings and hearings of
the committee except that in his absence the
ranking majority member who is present at
the meeting shall preside.
(b) Notwithstanding the rule prescribed by
subsection (a) any member of the committee
may preside over the conduct of a hearing.
Rule 4. Quorums.—(a) Except as provided in
subsection (b) one-third of the membership
of the committee, including not less than
one member of the majority party and one
member of the minority party, shall con-
stitute a quorum for the conduct of business.
(b) Notwithstanding the rule prescribed by
subsection (a), one member shall constitute
a quorum for the purpose of conducting a
hearing.
Rule 5. Reporting of Measures or Rec-
ommendations.—No measure or recommenda-
tion shall be reported from the committee
unless a majority of the committee is actu-
ally present and a majority of those present
concur.
Rule 6. Proxy Voting; Polling.—(a) Except as
provided by paragraph 7(a)(3) of Rule XXVI
of the Standing Rules of the Senate (relating
to limitation on use of proxy voting to re-
port a measure or matter), members who are
unable to be present may have their vote re-
corded by proxy.
(b) At the discretion of the committee,
members who are unable to be present and
whose vote has not been cast by proxy may
be polled for the purpose of recording their
vote on any rollcall taken by the committee.
Rule 7. Order of Motions.—When several
motions are before the committee dealing
with related or overlapping matters, the
chairman may specify the order in which the
motions shall be voted upon.
Rule 8. Bringing a Matter to a Vote.—If the
chairman determines that a motion or
amendment has been adequately debated, he
may call for a vote on such motion or
amendment, and the vote shall then be
taken, unless the committee votes to con-
tinue debate on such motion or amendment,
as the case may be. The vote on a motion to
continue debate on any motion or amend-
ment shall be taken without debate.
Rule 9. Public Announcement of Committee
Votes.—Pursuant to paragraph 7(b) of Rule
XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate
(relating to public announcement of votes),
the results of rollcall votes taken by the
committee on any measure (or amendment
thereto) or matter shall be announced pub-
licly not later than the day on which such
measure or matter is ordered reported from
the committee.
Rule 10. Subpoenas.—Witnesses and memo-
randa, documents, and records may be sub-
poenaed by the chairman of the committee
with the agreement of the ranking minority
member or by a majority vote of the com-
mittee. Subpoenas for attendance of wit-
nesses and the production of memoranda,
documents, and records shall be issued by
the chairman, or by any other member of the
committee designated by him.
Rule 11. Nominations.—In considering a
nomination, the committee may conduct an
investigation or review of the nominee’s ex-
perience, qualifications, and suitability, to
serve in the position to which he or she has
been nominated. To aid in such investigation
or review, each nominee may be required to
submit a sworn detailed statement including
biographical, financial, policy, and other in-
formation which the committee may re-
quest. The committee may specify which
items in such statement are to be received
on a confidential basis. Witnesses called to
testify on the nomination may be required to
testify under oath.
Rule 12. Open Committee Hearings.—To the
extent required by paragraph 5 of Rule XXVI
of the Standing Rules of the Senate (relating
to limitations on open hearings), each hear-
ing conducted by the committee shall be

Rule 13. Announcement of Hearings.—The
committee shall undertake consistent with
the provisions of paragraph 4(a) of Rule

ings) to issue public announcements of hear-
ings it intends to hold at least one week
prior to the commencement of such hearings.
Rule 14. Witnesses at Hearings.—(a) Each
witness who is scheduled to testify at any
hearing must submit his written testimony
to the staff director not later than noon of
the business day immediately before the last
business day preceding the day on which he
is scheduled to appear. Such written testi-
mony shall be accompanied by a brief sum-
mary of the principal points covered in the
written testimony. Having submitted his
written testimony, the witness shall be al-
lowed not more than ten minutes for oral
presentation of his statement.
(b) Witnesses may not read their entire
written testimony, but must confine their
oral presentation to a summarization of
their arguments.
(c) Witnesses shall observe proper stand-
ards of dignity, decorum, and propriety while
presenting their views to the committee.
Any witness who violates this rule shall be
dismissed, and his testimony (both oral and
written) shall not appear in the record of the
hearing.
(d) In scheduling witnesses for hearings,
the staff shall attempt to schedule witnesses
so as to attain a balance of views early in
the hearings. Every member of the com-
mittee may designate witnesses who will ap-
pear before the committee to testify. To the
extent that a witness designated by a mem-
ber cannot be scheduled to testify during the
time set aside for the hearing, a special time
will be set aside for the witness to testify if
the member designating that witness is
available at that time to chair the hearing.
Rule 15. Audiences.—Persons admitted into
the audience for open hearings of the com-
mittee shall conduct themselves with the
dignity, decorum, courtesy, and propriety
traditionally observed by the Senate. Dem-
onstrations of approval or disapproval of any
statement or act by any member or witness
are not allowed. Persons creating confusion
or distractions or otherwise disrupting the
orderly proceeding of the hearing shall be ex-
pelled from the hearing.
Rule 16. Broadcasting of Hearings.—

vision or radio coverage shall be allowed
upon approval by the chairman of a request
filed with the staff director not later than
noon of the day before the day on which such
coverage is desired.
(b) If such approval is granted, broad-
casting coverage of the hearing shall be con-
ducted unobtrusively and in accordance with
the standards of dignity, propriety, courtesy,
and decorum traditionally observed by the
Senate.
(c) Equipment necessary for coverage by
television and radio media shall not be in-
stalled in, or removed from, the hearing
room while the committee is in session.
(d) Additional lighting may be installed in
the hearing room by the media in order to
raise the ambient lighting level to the lowest
level necessary to provide adequate tele-
vision coverage of the hearing at the then
current state of the art of television cov-
erage.
(e) The additional lighting authorized by
subsection (d) of this rule shall not be di-
rected into the eyes of any members of the
committee or of any witness, and at the re-
quest of any such member or witness, offend-
ing lighting shall be extinguished.
Rule 17. Subcommittees.—(a) The chairman,
subject to the approval of the committee,
shall appoint legislative subcommittees. The
ranking minority member shall recommend
to the chairman appointment of minority
members to the subcommittees. All legisla-
tion shall be kept on the full committee cal-
endar unless a majority of the members
present and voting agree to refer specific leg-
islation to an appropriate subcommittee.
(b) The chairman may limit the period dur-
ing which House-passed legislation referred
to a subcommittee under paragraph (a) will
remain in that subcommittee. At the end of

to the full committee calendar. The period
referred to in the preceding sentences should
be 6 weeks, but may be extended in the event
that adjournment or a long recess is immi-
nent.
(c) All decisions of the chairman are sub-
ject to approval or modification by a major-
ity vote of the committee.

majority vote of those members present dis-
charge a subcommittee from further consid-
eration of a specific piece of legislation.

members shall serve as nonvoting ex officio
members of the subcommittees on which
they do not serve as voting members.
(f) ) Any member of the committee may at-
tend hearings held by any subcommittee and
question witnesses testifying before that
subcommittee.
(g) Subcommittee meeting times shall be
coordinated by the staff director to ensure
that—

when the committee is in executive session,
except by unanimous consent;
(2) no more than one subcommittee will
meet when the full committee is holding
hearings; and

ant to Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of

portunity to correct their remarks for gram-
matical errors or to accurately reflect state-
ments made.

going rules may be added to, modified,

RULE XXVI
COMMITTEE PROCEDURE
2. Each committee shall adopt rules (not
inconsistent with the Rules of the Senate)
governing the procedure of such committee.
The rules of each committee shall be pub-
lished in the Congressional Record not later
than March 1 of the first year of each Con-
gress, except that if any such committee is
established on or after February 1 of a year,
the rules of that committee during the year
of establishment shall be published in the
Congressional Record not later than sixty
days after such establishment. Any amend-
ment to the rules of a committee shall not

no committee of the Senate or any sub-
committee thereof may meet, without spe-
cial leave, after the conclusion of the first
two hours after the meeting of the Senate

the minority leader (or in the event of the
absence of either of such leaders, from his
designee). The prohibition contained in the

Committee on Appropriations or the Com-
mittee on the Budget. The majority leader or
his designee shall announce to the Senate

(b) Each meeting of a committee, or any
subcommittee thereof, including meetings to
conduct hearings, shall be open to the public,
except that a meeting or series of meetings
by a committee or a subcommittee thereof
on the same subject for a period of no more
than fourteen calendar days may be closed to
the public on a motion made and seconded to
go into closed session to discuss only wheth-
er the matters enumerated in clauses (1)
through (6) would require the meeting to be
closed, followed immediately by a record
vote in open session by a majority of the
members of the committee or subcommittee
when it is determined that the matters to be
discussed or the testimony to be taken at
such meeting or meetings—
(1) will disclose matters necessary to be
kept secret in the interests of national de-
fense or the confidential conduct of the for-
eign relations of the United States;
(2) will relate solely to matters of com-
mittee staff personnel or internal staff man-
agement or procedure;
(3) will tend to charge an individual with
crime or misconduct, to disgrace or injure
the professional standing of an individual, or
otherwise to expose an individual to public
contempt or obloquy, or will represent a
clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy
of an individual;
(4) will disclose the identity of any in-
former or law enforcement agent or will dis-
close any information relating to the inves-
tigation or prosecution of a criminal offense
that is required to be kept secret in the in-
terests of effective law enforcement;
(5) will disclose information relating to the
trade secrets of financial or commercial in-
formation pertaining specifically to a given
person if—
(A) an Act of Congress requires the infor-
mation to be kept confidential by Govern-
ment officers and employees; or
(B) the information has been obtained by
the Government on a confidential basis,
other than through an application by such
person for a specific Government financial or
other benefit, and is required to be kept se-
cret in order to prevent undue injury to the
competitive position of such person; or
(6) may divulge matters required to be
kept confidential under other provisions of
law or Government regulations.
(c) Whenever any hearing conducted by
any such committee or subcommittee is
open to the public, that hearing may be
broadcast by radio or television, or both,
under such rules as the committee or sub-
committee may adopt.
(d) Whenever disorder arises during a com-
mittee meeting that is open to the public, or
any demonstration of approval or dis-
approval is indulged in by any person in at-
tendance at any such meeting, it shall be the
duty of the Chair to enforce order on his own
initiative and without any point of order
being made by a Senator. When the Chair
finds it necessary to maintain order, he shall
have the power to clear the room, and the
committee may act in closed session for so
long as there is doubt of the assurance of
order.
(e) Each committee shall prepare and keep
a complete transcript or electronic recording
adequate to fully record the proceeding of
each meeting or conference whether or not
such meeting or any part thereof is closed
under this paragraph, unless a majority of
its members vote to forgo such a record.

NOMINATION HOLD
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I
am placing a hold on the nomination of
Elizabeth Darling to be Commissioner
on Children, Youth and Families at the
Department of Health and Human
Services.
Since Ms. Darling has been renomi-
nated by the administration in the
116th Congress, the Department of
Health and Human Services gave the
State of South Carolina a green light
for religious-based discrimination in
its State-contracted foster care agen-
cies. Adults who can provide safe, lov-
ing, and nurturing homes for foster
kids will be denied that opportunity on
religious grounds.
I am also concerned about the slow
implementation of the Family First
Act, which the Finance Committee
passed on a bipartisan basis in the last
Congress. A big part of that law has
been delayed, and the latest informa-
tion I have heard regarding my con-
cerns is that there are ‘‘robust con-
versations’’ happening behind the
scenes. I expect that to improve going
forward.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
REMEMBERING BISHOP PAUL
ALEXANDER BOWERS
∑ Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today
I wish to honor the life and legacy of
the late Bishop Paul Alexander Bowers.
Known as the Preaching Machine,
Bishop Bowers pastored the congrega-
tion at Greater Emanuel Apostolic
Temple in my hometown of Cincinnati,
OH, for over 40 years.
Bishop Bowers attended his first Pen-
tecostal Assemblies of the World, Inc.,
Convention in Cleveland in 1947, where
he slept on the floor of the church due
to the lack of delegate housing. He was
ordained in 1950 and began preaching in
Cincinnati in 1957. Bishop Bowers was
elected to general secretary from 1968,
elevated to bishop in 1976, and elected
and served as presiding bishop of the
Pentecostal Assemblies of the World
from 1992 until 1998.
Bishop Bowers’ ministry reached
communities across Ohio and the
United States. His devotion to the Pen-
tecostal Assemblies of the World, Inc.,
and Greater Emanuel Apostolic Temple
in Cincinnati changed countless lives
as he used the gospel to help people ful-
fill their God-given potential and bet-
ter serve their communities.
I would like to recognize former pre-
siding Bishop Paul Alexander Bowers’
many accomplishments and his decades
of service to Pentecostal Assemblies of
the World, Inc. I would like to offer my
condolences on his passing to his fam-
ily, his friends, and his church, and I
hope his legacy continues in the thou-
sands of lives he has touched.∑

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE
REPORT ON THE STATE OF THE
UNION DELIVERED TO A JOINT
SESSION OF CONGRESS ON FEB-
RUARY 5, 2019—PM 3
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message
from the President of the United
States which was ordered to lie on the
table:
To the Congress of the United States:
Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President,
Members of Congress, the First Lady of
the United States, and my fellow
Americans: We meet tonight at a mo-
ment of unlimited potential. As we
begin a new Congress, I stand here
ready to work with you to achieve his-
toric breakthroughs for all Americans.
Millions of our fellow citizens are
watching us now, gathered in this
great chamber, hoping that we will
govern not as two parties but as one
Nation.
The agenda I will lay out this
evening is not a Republican agenda or
a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of
the American people.
Many of us campaigned on the same
core promises: to defend American jobs
and demand fair trade for American
workers; to rebuild and revitalize our
Nation’s infrastructure; to reduce the
price of healthcare and prescription
drugs; to create an immigration sys-
tem that is safe, lawful, modern and se-
cure; and to pursue a foreign policy
that puts America’s interests first.
There is a new opportunity in Amer-
ican politics, if only we have the cour-
age to seize it. Victory is not winning
for our party. Victory is winning for
our country.
This year, America will recognize
two important anniversaries that show
us the majesty of America’s mission,
and the power of American pride.
In June, we mark 75 years since the
start of what General Dwight D. Eisen-
hower called the Great Crusade—the
Allied liberation of Europe in World
War II. On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000
young American men jumped from the
sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from
the sea, to save our civilization from
tyranny. Here with us tonight are
three of those heroes: Private First
Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Ir-
ving Locker, and Sergeant Herman
Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you.
In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years
since brave young pilots flew a quarter
of a million miles through space to
plant the American flag on the face of
the moon. Half a century later, we are
joined by one of the Apollo 11 astro-
nauts who planted that flag: Buzz
Aldrin. This year, American astronauts
will go back to space on American
rockets.
In the 20th century, America saved
freedom, transformed science, and re-
defined the middle class standard of
living for the entire world to see. Now,
we must step boldly and bravely into
the next chapter of this great Amer-
ican adventure, and we must create a
new standard of living for the 21st cen-
tury. An amazing quality of life for all
of our citizens is within our reach.
We can make our communities safer,
our families stronger, our culture rich-
er, our faith deeper, and our middle
class bigger and more prosperous than
ever before.
But we must reject the politics of re-
venge, resistance, and retribution—and
embrace the boundless potential of co-
operation, compromise, and the com-
mon good.
Together, we can break decades of
political stalemate. We can bridge old
divisions, heal old wounds, build new
coalitions, forge new solutions, and
unlock the extraordinary promise of
America’s future. The decision is ours
to make.
We must choose between greatness or
gridlock, results or resistance, vision
or vengeance, incredible progress or
pointless destruction.
Tonight, I ask you to choose great-
ness.
Over the last 2 years, my Administra-
tion has moved with urgency and his-
toric speed to confront problems ne-
glected by leaders of both parties over
many decades.
In just over 2 years since the elec-
tion, we have launched an unprece-
dented economic boom—a boom that
has rarely been seen before. We have
created 5.3 million new jobs and impor-
tantly added 600,000 new manufacturing
jobs—something which almost every-
one said was impossible to do, but the
fact is, we are just getting started.
Wages are rising at the fastest pace
in decades, and growing for blue collar
workers, who I promised to fight for,
faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 mil-
lion Americans have been lifted off
food stamps. The United States econ-
omy is growing almost twice as fast
today as when I took office, and we are
considered far and away the hottest
economy anywhere in the world. Unem-
ployment has reached the lowest rate
in half a century. African-American,
Hispanic-American and Asian-Amer-
ican unemployment have all reached
their lowest levels ever recorded. Un-
employment for Americans with dis-
abilities has also reached an all-time
low. More people are working now than
at any time in our history—157 million.
We passed a massive tax cut for
working families and doubled the child
tax credit.
We virtually ended the estate, or
death, tax on small businesses,
ranches, and family farms.
We eliminated the very unpopular
Obamacare individual mandate pen-
alty—and to give critically ill patients
access to life-saving cures, we passed
right to try.
My Administration has cut more reg-
ulations in a short time than any other
administration during its entire ten-
ure. Companies are coming back to our
country in large numbers thanks to
historic reductions in taxes and regula-
tions.
We have unleashed a revolution in
American energy—the United States is
now the number one producer of oil and
natural gas in the world. And now, for
the first time in 65 years, we are a net
exporter of energy.
After 24 months of rapid progress, our
economy is the envy of the world, our
military is the most powerful on earth,
and America is winning each and every
day. Members of Congress: the State of
our Union is strong. Our country is vi-
brant and our economy is thriving like
never before.
On Friday, it was announced that we
added another 304,000 jobs last month
alone—almost double what was ex-
pected. An economic miracle is taking
place in the United States—and the
only thing that can stop it are foolish
wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan
investigations.
If there is going to be peace and leg-
islation, there cannot be war and inves-
tigation. It just doesn’t work that way!
We must be united at home to defeat
our adversaries abroad.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S863
February 5, 2019
This new era of cooperation can start
with finally confirming the more than
300 highly qualified nominees who are
still stuck in the Senate—some after
years of waiting. The Senate has failed
to act on these nominations, which is
unfair to the nominees and to our
country.
Now is the time for bipartisan action.
Believe it or not, we have already prov-
en that it is possible.
In the last Congress, both parties
came together to pass unprecedented
legislation to confront the opioid cri-
sis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic
VA reforms, and after four decades of
rejection, we passed VA Accountability
so we can finally terminate those who
mistreat our wonderful veterans.
And just weeks ago, both parties
united for groundbreaking criminal
justice reform. Last year, I heard
through friends the story of Alice
Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997,
Alice was sentenced to life in prison as
a first-time non-violent drug offender.
Over the next two decades, she became
a prison minister, inspiring others to
choose a better path. She had a big im-
pact on that prison population—and far
beyond.
Alice’s story underscores the dispari-
ties and unfairness that can exist in
criminal sentencing—and the need to
remedy this injustice. She served al-
most 22 years and had expected to be in
prison for the rest of her life.
In June, I commuted Alice’s sen-
tence—and she is here with us tonight.
Alice, thank you for reminding us that
we always have the power to shape our
own destiny.
When I saw Alice’s beautiful family
greet her at the prison gates, hugging
and kissing and crying and laughing, I
knew I did the right thing.
Inspired by stories like Alice’s, my
Administration worked closely with
members of both parties to sign the
First Step Act into law. This legisla-
tion reformed sentencing laws that
have wrongly and disproportionately
harmed the African-American commu-
nity. The First Step Act gives non-vio-
lent offenders the chance to re-enter
society as productive, law-abiding citi-
zens. Now, States across the country
are following our lead. America is a
Nation that believes in redemption.
We are also joined tonight by Mat-
thew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996,
at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35
years for selling drugs and related of-
fenses. Over the next two decades, he
completed more than 30 Bible studies,
became a law clerk, and mentored fel-
low inmates. Now, Matthew is the very
first person to be released from prison
under the First Step Act. Matthew, on
behalf of all Americans: welcome
home.
As we have seen, when we are united,
we can make astonishing strides for
our country. Now, Republicans and
Democrats must join forces again to
confront an urgent national crisis.
The Congress has 10 days left to pass
a bill that will fund our Government,
protect our homeland, and secure our
southern border.
Now is the time for the Congress to
show the world that America is com-
mitted to ending illegal immigration
and putting the ruthless coyotes, car-
tels, drug dealers, and human traf-
fickers out of business.
As we speak, large, organized cara-
vans are on the march to the United
States. We have just heard that Mexi-
can cities, in order to remove the ille-
gal immigrants from their commu-
nities, are getting trucks and buses to
bring them up to our country in areas
where there is little border protection.
I have ordered another 3,750 troops to
our southern border to prepare for the
tremendous onslaught.
This is a moral issue. The lawless
state of our southern border is a threat
to the safety, security, and financial
well-being of all Americans. We have a
moral duty to create an immigration
system that protects the lives and jobs
of our citizens. This includes our obli-
gation to the millions of immigrants
living here today, who followed the
rules and respected our laws. Legal im-
migrants enrich our Nation and
strengthen our society in countless
ways. I want people to come into our
country, but they have to come in le-
gally.
Tonight, I am asking you to defend
our very dangerous southern border out
of love and devotion to our fellow citi-
zens and to our country.
No issue better illustrates the divide
between America’s working class and
America’s political class than illegal
immigration. Wealthy politicians and
donors push for open borders while liv-
ing their lives behind walls and gates
and guards.
Meanwhile, working class Americans
are left to pay the price for mass ille-
gal migration—reduced jobs, lower
wages, overburdened schools and hos-
pitals, increased crime, and a depleted
social safety net.
Tolerance for illegal immigration is
not compassionate—it is cruel. One in
three women is sexually assaulted on
the long journey north. Smugglers use
migrant children as human pawns to
exploit our laws and gain access to our
country.
Human traffickers and sex traffickers
take advantage of the wide open areas
between our ports of entry to smuggle
thousands of young girls and women
into the United States and to sell them
into prostitution and modern-day slav-
ery.
Tens of thousands of innocent Ameri-
cans are killed by lethal drugs that
cross our border and flood into our cit-
ies—including meth, heroin, cocaine,
and fentanyl.
The savage gang, MS–13, now oper-
ates in 20 different American States,
and they almost all come through our
southern border. Just yesterday, an
MS–13 gang member was taken into
custody for a fatal shooting on a sub-
way platform in New York City. We are
removing these gang members by the
thousands, but until we secure our bor-
der they’re going to keep streaming
back in.
Year after year, countless Americans
are murdered by criminal illegal
aliens.
I’ve gotten to know many wonderful
Angel Moms, Dads, and families—no
one should ever have to suffer the hor-
rible heartache they have endured.
Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just
three weeks ago, Debra’s parents, Ger-
ald and Sharon, were burglarized and
shot to death in their Reno, Nevada,
home by an illegal alien. They were in
their eighties and are survived by four
children, 11 grandchildren, and 20
great-grandchildren. Also here tonight
are Gerald and Sharon’s grand-
daughter, Heather, and great-grand-
daughter, Madison.
To Debra, Heather, Madison, please
stand: few can understand your pain.
But I will never forget, and I will fight
for the memory of Gerald and Sharon,
that it should never happen again.
Not one more American life should be
lost because our Nation failed to con-
trol its very dangerous border.
In the last 2 years, our brave ICE of-
ficers made 266,000 arrests of criminal
aliens, including those charged or con-
victed of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000
sex crimes, and 4,000 killings.
We are joined tonight by one of those
law enforcement heroes: ICE Special
Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin
was a boy, he and his family legally
immigrated to the United States from
the Dominican Republic. At the age of
eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to
become a Special Agent. Today, he
leads investigations into the scourge of
international sex trafficking. Elvin
says: ‘‘If I can make sure these young
girls get their justice, I’ve done my
job.’’ Thanks to his work and that of
his colleagues, more than 300 women
and girls have been rescued from hor-
ror and more than 1,500 sadistic traf-
fickers have been put behind bars in
the last year.
Special Agent Hernandez, please
stand: We will always support the
brave men and women of Law Enforce-
ment—and I pledge to you tonight that
we will never abolish our heroes from
ICE.
My Administration has sent to the
Congress a commonsense proposal to
end the crisis on our southern border.
It includes humanitarian assistance,
more law enforcement, drug detection
at our ports, closing loopholes that en-
able child smuggling, and plans for a
new physical barrier, or wall, to secure
the vast areas between our ports of
entry. In the past, most of the people
in this room voted for a wall—but the
proper wall never got built. I’ll get it
built.
This is a smart, strategic, see-
through steel barrier—not just a sim-
ple concrete wall. It will be deployed in
the areas identified by border agents as
having the greatest need, and as these
agents will tell you, where walls go up,
illegal crossings go way down.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S864 February 5, 2019
San Diego used to have the most ille-
gal border crossings in the country. In
response, and at the request of San
Diego residents and political leaders, a
strong security wall was put in place.
This powerful barrier almost com-
pletely ended illegal crossings.
The border city of El Paso, Texas,
used to have extremely high rates of
violent crime—one of the highest in
the country, and considered one of our
Nation’s most dangerous cities. Now,
with a powerful barrier in place, El
Paso is one of our safest cities.
Simply put, walls work and walls
save lives. So let’s work together, com-
promise, and reach a deal that will
truly make America safe.
As we work to defend our people’s
safety, we must also ensure our eco-
nomic resurgence continues at a rapid
pace.
No one has benefitted more from our
thriving economy than women, who
have filled 58 percent of the new jobs
created in the last year. All Americans
can be proud that we have more women
in the workforce than ever before—and
exactly one century after the Congress
passed the Constitutional amendment
giving women the right to vote, we also
have more women serving in the Con-
gress than ever before.
As part of our commitment to im-
proving opportunity for women every-
where, this Thursday we are launching
the first ever Government-wide initia-
tive focused on economic empower-
ment for women in developing coun-
tries.
To build on our incredible economic
success, one priority is paramount—re-
versing decades of calamitous trade
policies.
We are now making it clear to China
that after years of targeting our indus-
tries, and stealing our intellectual
property, the theft of American jobs
and wealth has come to an end.
Therefore, we recently imposed tar-
iffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods—
and now our Treasury is receiving bil-
lions of dollars a month from a country
that never gave us a dime. But I don’t
blame China for taking advantage of
us—I blame our leaders and representa-
tives for allowing this travesty to hap-
pen. I have great respect for President
Xi, and we are now working on a new
trade deal with China. But it must in-
clude real, structural change to end un-
fair trade practices, reduce our chronic
trade deficit, and protect American
jobs.
Another historic trade blunder was
the catastrophe known as NAFTA.
I have met the men and women of
Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana,
New Hampshire, and many other
States whose dreams were shattered by
NAFTA. For years, politicians prom-
ised them they would negotiate for a
better deal. But no one ever tried—
until now.
Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment—or USMCA—will replace NAFTA
and deliver for American workers:
bringing back our manufacturing jobs,
expanding American agriculture, pro-
tecting intellectual property, and en-
suring that more cars are proudly
stamped with four beautiful words:
made in the USA.
Tonight, I am also asking you to pass
the United States Reciprocal Trade
Act, so that if another country places
an unfair tariff on an American prod-
uct, we can charge them the exact
same tariff on the same product that
they sell to us.
Both parties should be able to unite
for a great rebuilding of America’s
crumbling infrastructure.
I know that the Congress is eager to
pass an infrastructure bill—and I am
eager to work with you on legislation
to deliver new and important infra-
structure investment, including invest-
ments in the cutting edge industries of
the future. This is not an option. This
is a necessity.
The next major priority for me, and
for all of us, should be to lower the cost
of healthcare and prescription drugs—
and to protect patients with pre-exist-
ing conditions.
Already, as a result of my Adminis-
tration’s efforts, in 2018 drug prices ex-
perienced their single largest decline in
46 years.
But we must do more. It is unaccept-
able that Americans pay vastly more
than people in other countries for the
exact same drugs, often made in the
exact same place. This is wrong, unfair,
and together we can stop it.
I am asking the Congress to pass leg-
islation that finally takes on the prob-
lem of global freeloading and delivers
fairness and price transparency for
American patients. We should also re-
quire drug companies, insurance com-
panies, and hospitals to disclose real
prices to foster competition and bring
costs down.
No force in history has done more to
advance the human condition than
American freedom. In recent years we
have made remarkable progress in the
fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific
breakthroughs have brought a once-
distant dream within reach. My budget
will ask Democrats and Republicans to
make the needed commitment to elimi-
nate the HIV epidemic in the United
States within 10 years. Together, we
will defeat AIDS in America.
Tonight, I am also asking you to join
me in another fight that all Americans
can get behind: the fight against child-
hood cancer.
Joining Melania in the gallery this
evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl,
Grace Eline. Every birthday since she
was 4, Grace asked her friends to do-
nate to St. Jude Children’s Research
Hospital. She did not know that one
day she might be a patient herself.
Last year, Grace was diagnosed with
brain cancer. Immediately, she began
radiation treatment. At the same time,
she rallied her community and raised
more than $40,000 for the fight against
cancer. When Grace completed treat-
ment last fall, her doctors and nurses
cheered with tears in their eyes as she
hung up a poster that read: ‘‘Last Day
of Chemo.’’ Grace—you are an inspira-
tion to us all.
Many childhood cancers have not
seen new therapies in decades. My
budget will ask the Congress for $500
million over the next 10 years to fund
this critical life-saving research.
To help support working parents, the
time has come to pass school choice for
America’s children. I am also proud to
be the first President to include in my
budget a plan for nationwide paid fam-
ily leave—so that every new parent has
the chance to bond with their newborn
child.
There could be no greater contrast to
the beautiful image of a mother hold-
ing her infant child than the chilling
displays our Nation saw in recent days.
Lawmakers in New York cheered with
delight upon the passage of legislation
that would allow a baby to be ripped
from the mother’s womb moments be-
fore birth. These are living, feeling,
beautiful babies who will never get the
chance to share their love and dreams
with the world. And then, we had the
case of the Governor of Virginia where
he basically stated he would execute a
baby after birth.
To defend the dignity of every per-
son, I am asking the Congress to pass
legislation to prohibit the late-term
abortion of children who can feel pain
in the mother’s womb.
Let us work together to build a cul-
ture that cherishes innocent life. And
let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all
children—born and unborn—are made
in the holy image of God.
The final part of my agenda is to pro-
tect America’s National Security.
Over the last 2 years, we have begun
to fully rebuild the United States Mili-
tary—with $700 billion last year and
$716 billion this year. We are also get-
ting other nations to pay their fair
share. For years, the United States was
being treated very unfairly by NATO—
but now we have secured a $100 billion
increase in defense spending from
NATO allies.
As part of our military build-up, the
United States is developing a state-of-
the-art Missile Defense System.
Under my Administration, we will
never apologize for advancing Amer-
ica’s interests.
For example, decades ago the United
States entered into a treaty with Rus-
sia in which we agreed to limit and re-
duce our missile capabilities. While we
followed the agreement to the letter,
Russia repeatedly violated its terms.
That is why I announced that the
United States is officially withdrawing
from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.
Perhaps we can negotiate a different
agreement, adding China and others, or
perhaps we can’t—in which case, we
will outspend and out-innovate all oth-
ers by far.
As part of a bold new diplomacy, we
continue our historic push for peace on
the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages
have come home, nuclear testing has

stopped, and there has not been a mis-
sile launch in 15 months. If I had not
been elected President of the United
States, we would right now, in my
opinion, be in a major war with North
Korea with potentially millions of peo-
ple killed. Much work remains to be
done, but my relationship with Kim
Jong Un is a good one. And Chairman
Kim and I will meet again on February
27 and 28 in Vietnam.
Two weeks ago, the United States of-
ficially recognized the legitimate gov-
ernment of Venezuela, and its new in-
terim President, Juan Guaido.
We stand with the Venezuelan people
in their noble quest for freedom—and
we condemn the brutality of the
Maduro regime, whose socialist poli-
cies have turned that nation from
being the wealthiest in South America
into a state of abject poverty and de-
spair.
Here, in the United States, we are
alarmed by new calls to adopt social-
ism in our country. America was
founded on liberty and independence—
not government coercion, domination,
and control. We are born free, and we
will stay free. Tonight, we renew our
resolve that America will never be a
socialist country.
One of the most complex set of chal-
lenges we face is in the Middle East.
Our approach is based on principled
realism—not discredited theories that
have failed for decades to yield
progress. For this reason, my Adminis-
tration recognized the true capital of
Israel—and proudly opened the Amer-
ican Embassy in Jerusalem.
Our brave troops have now been
fighting in the Middle East for almost
19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, near-
ly 7,000 American heroes have given
their lives. More than 52,000 Americans
have been badly wounded. We have
spent more than $7 trillion in the Mid-
dle East.
As a candidate for President, I
pledged a new approach. Great nations
do not fight endless wars.
When I took office, ISIS controlled
more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq
and Syria. Today, we have liberated
virtually all of that territory from the
grip of these bloodthirsty killers.
Now, as we work with our allies to
destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time
to give our brave warriors in Syria a
warm welcome home.
I have also accelerated our negotia-
tions to reach a political settlement in
Afghanistan. Our troops have fought
with unmatched valor—and thanks to
their bravery, we are now able to pur-
sue a political solution to this long and
bloody conflict.
In Afghanistan, my Administration
is holding constructive talks with a
number of Afghan groups, including
the Taliban. As we make progress in
these negotiations, we will be able to
reduce our troop presence and focus on
counter-terrorism. We do not know
whether we will achieve an agree-
ment—but we do know that after two
decades of war, the hour has come to at
least try for peace.
Above all, friend and foe alike must
never doubt this Nation’s power and
will to defend our people. Eighteen
years ago, terrorists attacked the USS
Cole—and last month American forces
killed one of the leaders of the attack.
We are honored to be joined tonight
by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy
Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of
the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom:
we vow to always remember the heroes
of the USS Cole.
My Administration has acted deci-
sively to confront the world’s leading
state sponsor of terror: the radical re-
gime in Iran.
To ensure this corrupt dictatorship
never acquires nuclear weapons, I with-
drew the United States from the disas-
trous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall,
we put in place the toughest sanctions
ever imposed on a country.
We will not avert our eyes from a re-
gime that chants death to America and
threatens genocide against the Jewish
people. We must never ignore the vile
poison of anti-Semitism, or those who
spread its venomous creed. With one
voice, we must confront this hatred
anywhere and everywhere it occurs.
Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Ameri-
cans were viciously murdered in an
anti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life
Synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT Offi-
cer Timothy Matson raced into the
gunfire and was shot seven times chas-
ing down the killer. Timothy has just
had his 12th surgery—but he made the
trip to be here with us tonight. Officer
Matson: we are forever grateful for
your courage in the face of evil.
Tonight, we are also joined by Pitts-
burgh survivor Judah Samet. He ar-
rived at the synagogue as the massacre
began. But not only did Judah nar-
rowly escape death last fall—more than
seven decades ago, he narrowly sur-
vived the Nazi concentration camps.
Today is Judah’s 81st birthday. Judah
says he can still remember the exact
moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10
months in a concentration camp, when
he and his family were put on a train,
and told they were going to another
camp. Suddenly the train screeched to
a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah’s
family braced for the worst. Then, his
father cried out with joy: ‘‘It’s the
Americans.’’
A second Holocaust survivor who is
here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a
prisoner at Dachau Concentration
Camp. He remembers watching through
a hole in the wall of a cattle car as
American soldiers rolled in with tanks.
‘‘To me,’’ Joshua recalls, ‘‘the Amer-
ican soldiers were proof that God ex-
ists, and they came down from the
sky.’’
I began this evening by honoring
three soldiers who fought on D-Day in
the Second World War. One of them
was Herman Zeitchik. But there is
more to Herman’s story. A year after
he stormed the beaches of Normandy,
Herman was one of those American sol-
diers who helped liberate Dachau. He
was one of the Americans who helped
rescue Joshua from that hell on earth.
Almost 75 years later, Herman and
Joshua are both together in the gallery
tonight—seated side-by-side, here in
the home of American freedom. Her-
man and Joshua: your presence this
evening honors and uplifts our entire
Nation.
When American soldiers set out be-
neath the dark skies over the English
Channel in the early hours of D-Day,
1944, they were just young men of 18
and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft
toward the most momentous battle in
the history of war.
They did not know if they would sur-
vive the hour. They did not know if
they would grow old. But they knew
that America had to prevail. Their
cause was this Nation, and generations
yet unborn.
Why did they do it? They did it for
America—they did it for us.
Everything that has come since—our
triumph over communism, our giant
leaps of science and discovery, our
unrivaled progress toward equality and
justice—all of it is possible thanks to
the blood and tears and courage and vi-
sion of the Americans who came before.
Think of this Capitol—think of this
very chamber, where lawmakers before
you voted to end slavery, to build the
railroads and the highways, to defeat
fascism, to secure civil rights, to face
down an evil empire.
Here tonight, we have legislators
from across this magnificent republic.
You have come from the rocky shores
of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Ha-
waii; from the snowy woods of Wis-
consin and the red deserts of Arizona;
from the green farms of Kentucky and
the golden beaches of California. To-
gether, we represent the most extraor-
dinary Nation in all of history.
What will we do with this moment?
How will we be remembered?
I ask the men and women of this Con-
gress: Look at the opportunities before
us! Our most thrilling achievements
are still ahead. Our most exciting jour-
neys still await. Our biggest victories
are still to come. We have not yet
begun to dream.
We must choose whether we are de-
fined by our differences—or whether we
dare to transcend them.
We must choose whether we will
squander our inheritance—or whether
we will proudly declare that we are
Americans. We do the incredible. We
defy the impossible. We conquer the
unknown.
This is the time to re-ignite the
American imagination. This is the
time to search for the tallest summit,
and set our sights on the brightest
star. This is the time to rekindle the
bonds of love and loyalty and memory
that link us together as citizens, as
neighbors, as patriots.
This is our future—our fate—and our
choice to make. I am asking you to
choose greatness.
No matter the trials we face, no mat-
ter the challenges to come, we must go
forward together.

S. 340. A bill to promote competition
in the market for drugs and biological
products by facilitating the timely
entry of lower-cost generic and bio-
similar versions of those drugs and bio-
logical products; read the first time.
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over the
past few years, the national headlines
have been dominated by stories about
the high cost of pharmaceuticals. We
have seen jaw-dropping examples of
companies raising the cost of their
products overnight, pricing too many
families out of the prescription drugs
they need to survive. Just last week,
House and Senate Committees charged
with oversight of the pharmaceutical
industry heard heartbreaking testi-
mony from family members of those
dependent on insulin who have been
forced to ration their treatment be-
cause the annual cost of insulin has
nearly doubled since 2012. That is ap-
palling, and putting Americans into
that kind of situation is unacceptable.
Lawmakers across the political spec-
trum, including President Trump,
agree that Congress needs to act to
rein in these spiraling prescription
drug prices. Pharmaceutical companies
should be compensated for their impor-
tant work developing lifesaving treat-
ments. But when companies engage in
predatory practices at the expense of
consumers, we must act. That is why
today I am reintroducing the Creating
and Restoring Equal Access to Equiva-
lent Samples (CREATES) Act, bipar-
tisan legislation to end inappropriate
delay tactics that are used by some
brand-name drug companies to block
competition from more affordable ge-
neric drugs. I am glad to be joined by
Senators GRASSLEY, KLOBUCHAR, LEE
and 24 other Senators of both parties in
introducing this bill today.
The first delay tactic addressed by
the CREATES Act involves the with-
holding of drug samples that generic
manufacturers need to gain regulatory
approval. Federal law requires generic
competitors to prove that their low-
cost alternative is equally safe and ef-
fective as the brand-name drug with
which they wish to compete. Unfortu-
nately, some brand-name companies
are preventing generic manufacturers
from obtaining the samples they need
to make the necessary comparison.
This simple delay tactic misuses regu-
latory safeguards as a weapon to block
competition.
The second delay tactic addressed by
the CREATES Act involves the devel-
opment of shared safety protocols. For
some high-risk drugs, Federal law re-
quires a generic drug manufacturer to
join the brand-name drug manufac-
turer in a single, shared safety protocol
for distribution of the drug. Despite
this requirement, some brand-name
companies are refusing to negotiate
shared safety protocols with potential
generic competitors, again under-
mining those competitors’ ability to
gain FDA approval for their generic
versions of such drugs.
The CREATES Act allows the FDA
more discretion to approve alternative
safety protocols, rather than require
parties to develop shared safety proto-
cols. Any safety protocol approved by
the FDA must meet the rigorous statu-
tory standards already in place.
These exclusionary practices thwart
competition and deny consumers the
benefit of lower drug prices. Recog-
nizing the effect these tactics have in
keeping drug prices high, in May 2018,
FDA for the first time publicly identi-
fied brand-name drug companies that
abuse FDA’s safety programs or enact
their own restricted distribution sys-
tems to delay competition from ge-
neric and biosimilar manufacturers.
The FDA’s list shows 164 inquiries cov-
ering more than 50 prescription drugs
where access to samples was at issue.
In recent years, according to FDA tes-
timony to Congress, the number of in-
quiries has increased.
I share the concerns of Vermonters
and Americans across the country that
many prescription drugs are simply too
expensive. I hear this again and again,
from Vermonters in every corner of our
state. When brand companies can arti-
ficially raise the price of drugs by
using predatory practices, patients suf-
fer. Illnesses worsen. Families, govern-
ment programs, and other payers in
the healthcare system ultimately bear
those added, unnecessary costs.
Making meaningful reform to reduce
the cost of prescription drugs should be
a top priority for all lawmakers. The
CREATES Act is an important piece of
that puzzle, and is widely supported
across the political spectrum and has

been endorsed by more than 90 groups.
The Congressional Budget Office esti-
mates that the CREATES Act would
lower Federal spending on prescription
drugs by $3.9 billion and research shows
that the savings to patients with em-
ployer-based health insurance and the
health care system overall would be far
greater—many billions of dollars more.
Think for a moment about the im-
pact of price hikes on the family of a
patient facing a life-threatening ill-
ness. Across the country, hardworking
Americans feel like the system is
rigged against them by corporations
that are looking to make a profit at
any price. With examples like Turing
and Mylan, it is no wonder they feel
that way.
The CREATES Act is one piece of the
puzzle, addressing anticompetitive be-
havior that delays the creation of af-
fordable generic drugs. Drug afford-
ability is a bipartisan issue that affects
each and every American. These re-
forms will make a difference. I hope we
can finally act together to help put
more affordable prescription drugs in
the hands of Americans.

OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF
LINDSBORG, KANSAS
Mr. MORAN (for himself and Mr.
ROBERTS) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary:
S. RES. 43
Whereas February 20, 2019, marks the 150th
anniversary of the establishment of
Lindsborg, a town in McPherson County,
Kansas;
Whereas, in 1868, Kansas was known as
‘‘the great American desert,’’ as it was re-
ported that it never rained in Kansas, and
upon organizing the first Swedish Agricul-
tural Company in April 1868, Chairman John
Ferm said, ‘‘If God is going to let us settle in
Kansas, he will give us rain.’’;
Whereas, after claims were filed in May
1866 in the general area that was to become
Lindsborg, the Swedish Agricultural Com-
pany entered into a contract for the pur-

IN APPRECIATION OF PLASMA
DONORS
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 5, 2019
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the importance of donating
plasma and to applaud those individuals that
make the commitment to be a plasma donor.
Many Americans are impacted by rare, seri-
ous, and sometimes life-threatening medical
conditions that are effectively managed by
therapies derived from donated plasma. Pa-
tients affected by alpha-1 antitrypsin defi-
ciency, chronic inflammatory demyelinating
polyneuropathy, hemophilia, hereditary
angioedema, platelet disorders, primary im-
munodeficiency diseases, as well as other
communities rely on plasma-derived therapies.
For many of these patients, plasma-derived
therapies represent life-sustaining or life-im-
proving medicine that is only available and ac-
cessible as a result of plasma donors. More-
over, these therapies represent the cutting-
edge of medicine and it often takes dozens of
donations to prepare one course of treatment
for a single patient.
These communities are collectively rep-
resented by the American Plasma Users Coa-
lition, which works on policy issues to protect
the safety of plasma donors and plasma prod-
ucts, and to ensure an adequate supply of
plasma donations to meet the medical needs
of patients. As science advances and we are
better able to diagnose these conditions and
treat additional conditions due to break-
throughs with plasma-derived therapies, we
will need more Americans to make the impor-
tant choice to donate plasma to ensure all pa-
tients continue to have access to essential
treatments.
Many of us have already made the commit-
ment to be either an occasional or regular
plasma donor. Often times, this decision
stems from knowing a patient who relies on
plasma-derived therapies and understanding
the tremendous impact a simple donation has
on their health and the well-being of their fam-
ily. Plasma donors come from all walks-of-life
and all backgrounds, but to the patient com-
munity they are everyday heroes.
Madam Speaker, let us recognize the con-
tributions of plasma donors while calling atten-
tion to the importance of plasma donation.

CONGRATULATIONS ON
RETIREMENT
HON. DANIEL WEBSTER
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 5, 2019
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to commemorate the successful
career of Dr. G.P. ‘‘Bud’’ Peterson. On Janu-
ary 7, 2019, Dr. Peterson announced that he
will be retiring from the role of President at the
Georgia Institute of Technology, commonly
known as Georgia Tech.
His retirement comes after eleven years of
service to this great academic institution.
Throughout those years, Bud demonstrated
extraordinary leadership. A few examples in-
clude having the university accepted into the
Association of American Universities, increas-
ing enrollment while other academic institu-
tions are struggling, expanding areas of re-
search, and being named a top-10 public re-
search university. As a graduate of Georgia
Tech, I am proud of what this institution has
accomplished. Thanks in part to the talented
faculty and the direction President Peterson
provided.
Dr. Peterson is truly leaving Georgia Tech a
better place than when he arrived. Sandy and
I wish him well and congratulate him on his
wonderful career. I thank him for all he has
done to make Georgia Tech a better place,
and wish him good luck in all future endeav-
ors.

HAVEN JOOST GIBSON
HON. SAM GRAVES
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 5, 2019
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker,
I proudly pause to recognize Haven Joost Gib-
son. Haven is a very special young man who
has exemplified the finest qualities of citizen-
ship and leadership by taking an active part in
the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 96, and
earning the most prestigious award of Eagle
Scout.
Haven has been very active with his troop,
participating in many scout activities. Over the
many years Haven has been involved with
scouting, he has not only earned numerous
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably,
Haven built 5 bat houses that hold up to 300
bats each for the Lake of the Ozarks National
Park.
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join
me in commending Haven Joost Gibson for
his accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of
America and for his efforts put forth in achiev-
ing the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

OATH CEREMONY ON FEBRUARY 8,
2019
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 5, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with
great pleasure and sincerity that I take this
time to congratulate thirty individuals who will
take their oaths of citizenship on February 8,
2019. This memorable occasion will be held at
the United States Courthouse and Federal
Building in Hammond, Indiana.
America is a country founded by immi-
grants. From its beginning, settlers have come
from countries around the world to the United
States in search of better lives for their fami-
lies. Oath ceremonies are a shining example
of what is so great about the United States of
America—that people from all over the world
can come together and unite as members of
a free, democratic nation. These individuals
realize that nowhere else in the world offers a
better opportunity for success than here in
America.
On February 8, 2019, the following people,
representing many nations throughout the
world, will take their oaths of citizenship in
Hammond, Indiana: Mahmooda Mohammed,
Alice Nyambura Ngatia, Nicholas Ngugi Kiraki,
Barbara Lucio, Riste Trajanovski, Janette
Magallanes, Tehmina Talib, Birute Arnold,
Chantal Mutabazi, Ainka Faustina de Coteau,
Ian Frederick Griffiths, Huy N. Huynh, Brenda
Berenice Avila Rosales, Rodrigo Garcia,
Elisabeth Navarro, Ristana Lazaroska, Elva
Lucero Madrigal, Audrey Corinne Kaucoud
Behinan, Chulida O’Donnell, Jose Efrain
Aguilar, Sohaib Aleem, Moshe Michael
Abudraham, Pablo Ernesto Bernaschina,
Mayra Mercado-Estrada, Mary Teresa Duffy,
Norma Lizeth Cruz, Adriana Bell, Faustin
Kagesera, Marisol Bosio, and Hugh Gong.
Although each individual has sought to be-
come a citizen of the United States for his or
her own reasons, be it for education, occupa-
tion, or to offer their loved ones better lives,
each is inspired by the fact that the United
States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln de-
scribed it, a country ‘‘. . . of the people, by
the people, and for the people.’’ They realize
that the United States is truly a free nation. By
seeking American citizenship, they have made
the decision that they want to live in a place
where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment
of the Constitution, they can practice religion
as they choose, speak their minds without fear
of punishment, and assemble in peaceful pro-
test should they choose to do so.
Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask you and
my other distinguished colleagues to join me
in congratulating these individuals who will be-
come citizens of the United States of America
on February 8, 2019. They, too, are American
citizens, guaranteed the inalienable rights to
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We,
as a free and democratic nation, congratulate
them and welcome them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E130 February 5, 2019
Ms. Hritz teaches World History at Davidson
Middle School, where she has spent her twen-
ty-year teaching career.
Ms. Hritz has served the Okaloosa County
School District with exceptional passion and
an unwavering commitment to excellence.
It is recognized that the teaching profession
is one of the most difficult yet rewarding pro-
fessions in existence. Ms. Hritz has continued
to exceed all expectations and proves her de-
votion to her profession in a multitude of ways.
Ms. Hritz possesses the dynamic capability
to encompass many different facets in her les-
sons. She is specifically known for incor-
porating ELA standards within her social stud-
ies activities.
She immerses her students in the content
by using Socratic Seminars to deepen their
understanding and develop communication
skills in a respectful environment.
Ms. Hritz exhibits her passion for education
every day in her actions. Her unmistakable
love for her job provides a strong foundation
for her ability to successfully engage and en-
courage her students.
Ms. Hritz also effectively draws from her
own experiences to compliment her instruc-
tion. Having traveled to some of the very
places of which she teaches, enables her to
better instill a sense of wonder about the
world in her students and to encourage them
to embrace other cultures.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United
States Congress, I am privileged to recognize
Angela Hritz for her accomplishments and her
profound commitment to the Okaloosa County
School District. I offer my gratitude for her
service and wish her all the best for continued
success.

SEYFER FAMILY
HON. ED PERLMUTTER
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 5, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud The Seyfer
Family for receiving the 2019 West Metro
Chamber of Commerce’s Steve Burkholder Di-
amond Legacy Award.
This award is reserved for individuals who
achieve the highest level of respect within the
their community. Nominees are known as the
‘‘shining stars’’ of the current business world
and must have had a positive economic im-
pact within the Jefferson County community
over the last year. This is true of the one and
only Seyfer family—Margie, Christy, Don,
TinaMarie and Troy—who have all contributed
to their community in unique and substantial
ways.
Margie Seyfer has co-chaired the Wheat
Ridge Carnation Festival and Wheat Ridge
Kite Flight Festival as well as spearhead
membership and recruitment efforts for the
Wheat Ridge Business Association. For the
past several years, she has also served as a
reading tutor for Jefferson County and Denver
Public Schools.
Christy Seyfer has also been an integral
part of the Wheat Ridge Carnation Festival as
their designated photographer and organizing
the kid’s craft booth. She has also volunteered
with the Wheat Ridge Kit Flight Festival, Ar-
vada Center Dance Academy, and the Wheat
Ridge High School’s Boy’s Tennis Team
Booster Club, After Prom Committee, and
STEM Program. In 2015–2016, she co-created
the Wheat Ridge Business Association Christ-
mas Tree Auction and served on the planning
committee.
Don Seyfer formed Seyfer Automotive in the
spring of 1961 and has been actively involved
in leadership for the Automotive Service Asso-
ciation, both state and national chapters, and
served as the National Chairman for the ASA.
Locally, he served as a board member for
Wheat Ridge Local Works (formerly Wheat
Ridge 2020) and the Wheat Ridge Business
Association.
After twenty years of working for Corporate
America, Troy and Tinamarie Seyfer, decided
it was time to follow their passion and start
Seyfer Specialties, a hot rod specialty busi-
ness in Wheat Ridge. Tinamarie has been on
the Board ofDirectors with the Wheat Ridge
Business Association for the last four years
and is currently the Vice President. Troy vol-
unteers and/or directs several car shows
throughout the year in the community, includ-
ing the Berkeley Bash and the All Ford Show
where money is raised for different charities.
In 2014, the couple created the Annual 44th
Avenue Rumble which brings together com-
munity leaders, car enthusiasts, families, and
small business owners in the community as
well as raises funds for the Wheat Ridge High
School’s STEM program.
The Seyfer family has clearly demonstrated
an extraordinary ability to influence their com-
munity and have used their strong leadership
skills to advance community and business
success through public service and philan-
thropy.
I extend my deepest congratulations to The
Seyfer Family for this well-deserved recogni-
tion.

ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNDER-

CAROLINA
HON. MARK WALKER
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 5, 2019
Mr. WALKER. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the bicentennial anniversary of
the Underground Railroad in North Carolina.
With the first known stop of the Underground
Railroad being in Guilford County, this portion
of North Carolina’s Sixth Congressional Dis-
trict became a refuge for slaves seeking hope
and freedom. I am proud to stand and reflect
on the brave individuals like Vestal Coffin and
his family, New Garden Quakers who sac-
rificed immensely for the cause of freedom
and justice. In honor of the bicentennial anni-
versary of the North Carolina Underground
Railroad, Guilford County will be hosting sev-
eral ceremonies, forums, and educational
events. As we celebrate National African
American History Month, I join the citizens of
Guilford County and North Carolina in recog-
nizing this important moment in our nation’s
history.

Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker,
I proudly pause to recognize Earl W. and
Linda M. Lammers, who are celebrating their
50th wedding anniversary on May 16, 2019.
Earl and Linda fondly recall how they met
on a blind date in October and have since
loved and cherished each other for over half
a century. Earl and Linda have never met a
flea market they didn’t like and both willingly
suffer through deer hunting season or never
ending music shows at the Missouri Theater.
They also continue to spend many days and
nights a year in the most fun place on earth—
Branson. Earl and Linda have leaned on each
other through losses of dear friends and fam-
ily, and both have spent their time together
supporting their children and grandchildren in
all school and community endeavors.
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join
me, their friends, and their sons, Kevin and
Scott, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren in
congratulating Earl W. and Linda M. Lammers
and wishing them many more years of health
and happiness together.

JOYRIDE BREWING
HON. ED PERLMUTTER
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 5, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Joyride Brew-
ing Company for receiving the 2019 Medium
Business of the Year Award from the West
Metro Chamber of Commerce.
Located in Edgewater right across from
Sloan’s Lake, Joyride Brewing is a small craft
brewery focused on producing great quality
brews with a fun atmosphere. Along with their
majestic views, they have a 10-barrel
brewhouse with eight serving tanks and six
fermenters. Currently, their taproom holds
around 95 people and they have plans to
open a rooftop this spring.
When they first opened, their goal was to
put the word ‘‘neighbor back in to neighbor-
hoods’’ and they have done just that, helping
bring together residents and neighbors to
share ideas and good beer. This is also dem-
onstrated with their annual anniversary street
party.
Another story that embodies their fun-loving
spirit is their mascot, Roger. Roger was the
first elephant ever used by Barnum and Bai-
ley’s Circus. Barnum would keep Roger and
the other elephants at Sloan’s Lake during the
winters while they weren’t touring, providing
daily entertainment to the surrounding commu-
nity. To that end, they felt like Roger em-
bodied their motto: ‘‘Life is about enjoying the
journey, not always the destination.’’
I extend my deepest congratulations to Joy-
ride Brewing Company for this well-deserved
recognition.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, this
February we recognize and celebrate the 41st
commemoration of Black History Month.
This month we celebrate the contributions of
African Americans to the history of our great
nation, and pay tribute to trailblazers, pio-
neers, heroes, and leaders like the 44th Presi-
dent of the United States and First Lady,
Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, respec-
tively; Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; Su-
preme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall; U.S.
Senator Blanche Kelso Bruce; U.S. Congress-
woman Barbara Jordan; U.S. Congressman
Mickey Leland; Astronauts Dr. Guion Stewart
Bluford, Jr. and Mae C. Jemison; activists, in-
tellectuals, authors, artists, and entrepreneurs
like Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Wash-
ington, James Baldwin, Harriet Tubman, Rosa
Parks, Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, Gwen-
dolyn Brooks, Shonda Rhimes, Ava Duvernay,
and Oprah Winfrey, just to name a few of the
countless number of well-known and unsung
heroes whose contributions have helped our
nation become a more perfect union.
The history of the United States has been
marked by the great contributions of African
American activist, leaders, writers, and artists.
As a member of Congress, I know that I
stand on the shoulders of giants whose strug-
gles and triumphs made it possible for me to
stand here today and continue the fight for
equality, justice, and progress for all, regard-
less of race, religion, gender or sexual orienta-
tion.
The greatest of these giants to me are Mrs.
Ivalita ‘‘Ivy’’ Jackson, a vocational nurse, and
Mr. Ezra A. Jackson, one of the first
African Americans to succed in the comic
book publishing business.
They were my beloved parents and they
taught me the value of education, hard work,
discipline, perseverance, and caring for others.
And I am continually inspired by Dr. Elwyn
Lee, my husband and the first tenured African
American law professor at the University of
Houston.
Madam Speaker, I particularly wish to ac-
knowledge the contributions of African Amer-
ican veterans in defending from foreign ag-
gressors and who by their courageous exam-
ples helped transform our nation from a seg-
regated society to a nation committed to the
neverending challenge of perfecting our union.
A few years ago about this time, I was hon-
ored to join my colleagues, Congressman
JOHN LEWIS and Congressman Charles Ran-
gel, a Korean War veteran, in paying tribute to
surviving members of the Tuskegee Airmen
and the 555th Parachute Infantry, the famed
‘‘Triple Nickels’’ at a moving ceremony spon-
sored by the U.S. Army commemorating the
50th Anniversary of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
The success of the Tuskegee Airmen in es-
corting bombers during World War II—achiev-
ing one of the lowest loss records of all the
escort fighter groups, and being in constant
demand for their services by the allied bomber
units—is a record unmatched by any other
fighter group.
So impressive and astounding were the
feats of the Tuskegee Airmen that in 1948, it
helped persuade President Harry Truman to
issue his famous Executive Order No. 9981,
which directed equality of treatment and op-
portunity in all of the United States Armed
Forces and led to the end of racial segrega-
tion in the U.S. military forces.
It is a source of enormous and enduring
pride that my father-in-law, Phillip Ferguson
Lee, was one of the Tuskegee Airmen.
Clearly, what began as an experiment to de-
termine whether ‘‘colored’’ soldiers’ were ca-
pable of operating expensive and complex
combat aircraft ended as an unqualified suc-
cess based on the experience of the
Tuskegee Airmen, whose record included 261
aircraft destroyed, 148 aircraft damaged,
15,553 combat sorties and 1,578 missions
over Italy and North Africa.
They also destroyed or damaged over 950
units of ground transportation and escorted
more than 200 bombing missions.
They proved that ‘‘the antidote to racism is
excellence in performance,’’ as retired Lt. Col.
Herbert Carter once remarked.
Madam Speaker, Black History Month is
also a time to remember many pioneering
women like U.S. Congresswoman Shirley
Chisholm; activists Harriet Tubman and Rosa
Parks; astronaut Mae C. Jemison; mathemati-
cians like Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy
Vaughan and Mary Jackson authors Maya
Angelou, Toni Morrison, and Gwendolyn
Brooks; all of whom have each in their own
way, whether through courageous activism,
cultural or intellectual contributions, or artistic
creativity, forged social and political change,
and forever changed our great Nation for the
better.
It is also fitting, Madam Speaker, that in ad-
dition to those national leaders whose con-
tributions have made our nation better, we
honor also those who have and are making a
difference in their local communities.
In my home city of Houston, there are nu-
merous men and women who are great be-
cause they have heeded the counsel of Dr.
King who said:
‘‘Everybody can be great because anybody
can serve. You only a need a heart full of
grace. A soul generated by love.’’
By that measure, I wish to pay tribute to
some of the great men and women who
helped to make Houston the wonderful, dy-
namic, vibrant, inclusive, and progressive city
that it is:
1. Mayor Sylvester Turner
2. Rev. F.N. Williams, Sr.
3. Rev. Dr. S.J. Gilbert, Sr.
4. Rev. Eldridge Stanley Branch
5. Rev. William A. Lawson
6. Mr. John Brand
7. Ms. Ruby Moseley
8. Ms. Dorothy Hubbard
9. Ms. Doris Hubbard
10. Ms. Willie Bell Boone
11. Ms. Holly HogoBrooks
12. Mr. Deloyd Parker
As we celebrate Black History Month, let us
pay tribute to those who have come before us,
and pay forward to future generations by ad-
dressing what is the number one issue for Af-
rican American families, and all American fam-
ilies today: preserving the American promise
of economic opportunity for all.
Our immediate focus must be job creation,
and enacting legislation that will foster and lay
the foundation for today’s and tomorrow’s gen-
eration of groundbreaking activists, leaders,
scientists, writers and artists to continue con-
tributing to the greatness of America.
We must continue to preserve the American
Dream for all.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand here
in celebration of the heroic and historic acts of
African Americans and their indispensable
contributions to this great Nation.
It is through our work in creating possibilities
for today and future generations that we best
honor the accomplishments and legacy of our
predecessors.

MCKAY RUSSELL MARBLE
HON. SAM GRAVES
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 5, 2019
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker,
I proudly pause to recognize McKay Russell
Marble. McKay is a very special young man
who has exemplified the finest qualities of citi-
zenship and leadership by taking an active
part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 96,
and earning the most prestigious award of
Eagle Scout.
McKay has been very active with his troop,
participating in many scout activities. Over the
many years McKay has been involved with
scouting, he has not only earned numerous
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably,
McKay organized his troop to nail 600 metal
plates to the power poles in Gallatin Missouri,
so the city could slide in numbers to help them
identify different power poles.
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join
me in commending McKay Russell Marble for
his accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of
America and for his efforts put forth in achiev-
ing the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

RECOGNIZING CHARLES J.
DIMATTEO
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 5, 2019
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize my constituent, Mr. Charles
DiMatteo, who will be celebrating his 100th
Birthday on February 8.
The son of a produce store owner father
and a seamstress mother from Sicily, Charles
lived the American Dream. He was born at
home and raised in Boston, Massachusetts,
as one of nine children. His parents were well-
known in the area as co-founders of Sacred
Heart Church on North Street in the North
End. Charles went to school and helped out in
the family store.
Charles received a draft notice and entered
the Army Air Corps in 1942, serving as a radio
operator and marksman. He was in 16 mis-
sions under fire in places like Burma, China
and India. He suffered serious injury while un-
loading a cargo plane and was hospitalized.
Charles continued his service until 1946, when
he was honorably discharged with many serv-
ice medals and honors.
Following his military service, Charles
worked as a railroad claims agent and ran a
wholesale produce business. His fruit baskets
were legendary in the area and he was re-
ferred to as the ‘‘Basket King.’’ He is a lifelong
member of the VFW (Veterans of Foreign
Wars) and the DAV (Disabled American Vet-
erans). After retiring at age 70 and relocating
to Florida, he joined DAV Chapter 133 in
Pompano Beach.
Charles is known as a generous man who
has supported many charities over the years.
Charles is also a family man with a loving wife
Anita, two children, 7 grandchildren and 9
great-grandchildren. Despite knee replacement
and back surgeries, Charles still gets around
quite well at age 99. Not surprisingly, he is a
fan of the Boston Red Sox and the New Eng-
land Patriots, and enjoys watching their games
on television. His other hobbies include fol-
lowing the stock market, swimming and dining
out.
Madam Speaker, today I am pleased to
honor Mr. Charles DiMatteo and his service to
his country and his community. Happy Birth-
day, Charles.

HON. ED PERLMUTTER
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 5, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Spay Today,
Neuter Now for receiving the 2019 Nonprofit of
the Year Award from the West Metro Chamber
of Commerce.
Dr. Angelina Piccoli brought her vision to
help pets and pet owners in need to life and
founded Spay Today in 2009. Over the last
ten years, the company has grown from two
employees to 20, serving over 10,000 pets
each year. To date, the company has spayed
and neutered more than 65,000 cats, dogs
and rabbits and provided low-cost vaccines,
microchips and other veterinary care to thou-
sands more.
Under the leadership of our Executive Direc-
tor, Cassie Tanner, and the Board of Direc-
tors, Spay Today purchased a building at the
end of 2017 and renovations are nearly com-
plete on the new clinic in the Eiber neighbor-
hood in Lakewood. Their relocation will allow
them to expand the safety net for pets in need
by adding much needed basic wellness serv-
ices along with a community outreach pro-
gram.
Spay Today works with community partners
like The Action Center and Colorado Pet Pan-
try to provide free veterinary care to pet own-
ers struggling financially. In 2016, they
launched Healthy Paws, a voucher program
which has provided nearly 1,000 free spays
and neuters to pets in need.
Thank you to Spay Today, Neuter Now for
their commitment to providing high-quality, ac-
cessible and affordable spay, neuter and basic
veterinary care to our community. I extend my
deepest congratulations to Spay Today, Neu-
ter Now for this well-deserved recognition.
CELEBRATING NATIONAL SCHOOL
COUNSELING WEEK AND
VANESSA IAQUINTA
HON. LINDA T. SÁNCHEZ
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 5, 2019
Ms. SÁNCHEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to celebrate National School Counseling
Week, and to honor a treasured member of
my community and school counselor at Nor-
walk High School, Vanessa Iaquinta. Ms.
Iaquinta has dedicated over 20 years to em-
powering students and serving as a role
model, mentor, and advocate to students and
their families in our community. She always
goes above and beyond what is expected of
her to serve the students at Norwalk High
School.
In addition to her role as a counselor, she
has taken on many leadership roles. Ms.
Iaquinta leads the AVID program, which
serves over 200 students and has been im-
mensely successful under her guidance,
achieving an inspiring 100 percent college ac-
ceptance rate. She also serves as the coun-
selor for the Project Lead the Way, which of-
fers students interested in the medical field the
opportunity to take classes and field trips to
help them achieve their college and career
dreams.
Ms. Iaquinta developed class presentations
to help students create four-year plans, dis-
cuss graduation and college requirements,
and provide other resources to support stu-
dents in planning for post-secondary school.
She also organized the other counselors to
provide evening appointments for parents who
otherwise would not be able to meet with
counselors to discuss their child’s academic
performance and progress. Ms. Iaquinta truly
cares about students and wants them to suc-
ceed. She has contributed to Norwalk in many
ways, and works hard to bring new ideas and
programs to the school that will benefit the
students.
Norwalk High School is a special place be-
cause of dedicated professionals like Ms.
Iaquinta, and I couldn’t be more proud to
honor her today. If more people were like Ms.
Iaquinta, the world would be a much nicer
place. In honor of National School Counseling
Week, I ask my colleagues to join me in
thanking all the school counselors who are
making a positive impact in the lives of our
students.

local Shop with a Cop program, providing chil-
dren in need with the opportunity to go shop-
ping during the holidays with an officer or first
responder from the Sheriff’s Department. He
and his wife, Virginia, were instrumental in
bringing the program to London in 1996. As a
result of their perseverance and fundraising ef-
forts over the last two decades, Shop with a
Cop has continued to grow and give hope to
children who need it the most. Don was also
a board member of the London-Laurel County
DARE program for many years, where he tire-
lessly worked to prevent drug abuse through
school education programs.
Don was a faithful member of the Calvary
Baptist Church and a member of the C.D.
Ward Masonic Lodge and Oleika Shriners
Temple in Lexington, Kentucky. He was also
named a Kentucky Colonel by Governor Paul
Patton. In fact, Don was so beloved by his
hometown, he was voted a ‘‘London Living
Treasure’’ in 2018, an award presented to
those who have given a lifetime of service to
London and Laurel County.
Don’s commitment to Laurel County is a
testament to the impact one person can have
on a community. My wife, Cynthia, and I send
our heartfelt condolences to Virginia and the
host of family, friends and community mem-
bers whose lives were affected by this great
man. We deeply appreciate the compassion
he shared and the service he gave to his com-
munity.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring the late Don Wattenbarger for
a lifetime of dedicated service in southern
Kentucky.

CELEBRATION AND RECOGNITION
OF THE HONORABLE STATE REP-

HON. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT
OF NEW YORK

Tuesday, February 5, 2019
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, the Hon-
orable Danilo Burgos is the State Representa-
tive for Pennsylvania’s 197th State House dis-
trict and is the first Dominican-American to
represent the neighborhoods in North Philadel-
phia of Fairhill, Kensington, Hunting Park,
Glenwood, and Feltonville in the Pennsylvania
House of Representatives; and elected in
2018 as the first Dominican-American to hold
that seat in the legislature.
Representative Burgos and his family have
strong ties to Huntington Park and where Rep-
resentative Burgos first became interested in
social justice and community activism that led
him to be a co-founder of the Philadelphia Do-
minican Grocers’ Association to support and
galvanize Philadelphia-area grocery and
bodega owners like his family to engage with
their communities and become informed and
involved in American politics.
Representative Burgos works with business
and community leaders to create economic
stability and safer communities in North Phila-
delphia, serving on the boards of the Eastern
Pennsylvania Organizing Project, the Hispanic
Chamber of Commerce, the Visitation Com-
munity Center, and Proyectos Sin Fronteras,
among others.
Representative Burgos has made political
engagement a priority placing an emphasis on
highlighting and supporting political engage-
ment; ‘‘Get involved in what you care about—

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Food For
Thought Catering for receiving the 2019 Small
Business of the Year Award from the West
Metro Chamber of Commerce.
Forty years ago, Wheat Ridge native Su-
zanne Smith, and another parent thought the
420 students at the parochial school their chil-
dren were attending deserved more than a
cold sack lunch every day. For six years, the
two mothers came to the school once a month
to prepare a hot lunch for the students. Sev-
eral years later, Suzanne was asked if she
could prepare food for a rehearsal dinner.
Food For Thought Catering was born and
today the company caters everything from
small intimate dinners for two to events for
250 people as well as breakfast, lunch, dinner,
business meetings special events, and after-
noon teas. ‘‘Food with thought’’ has been their
guiding principle and motto ever since.

IN RECOGNITION OF ALPHA
KAPPA ALPHA SORORITY, INC.
PINK GOES RED DAY FOR HEART
HEALTH
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 5, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise
to recognize my sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha
Sorority for the extraordinary work it does all
throughout the nation.
On January 15, 1908, nine college students
on the campus of Howard University in Wash-
ington, D.C. founded Alpha Kappa Alpha So-
rority.
As a member of the Xi Alpha Omega Chap-
ter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incor-
porated, I take great pride in my sorority’s tra-
dition of service and the many programs that
it has established to serve our communities.
One of the founders, Ethel Hedgeman Lyle,
dreamed of creating a support network for
like-minded women coming together for mu-
tual uplift, and coalescing their talents and
strengths for the benefit of others.
What began as a small band of sisters in
1908, transformed over the ensuing 111 years
into a globally-impactful organization of nearly
300,000 college-trained members, bound by
the bonds of sisterhood and empowered by a
commitment to servant-leadership that is both
domestic and international in scope.
As Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority has grown,
it has maintained its focus in two key arenas:
the lifelong personal and professional develop-
ment of each of its members; and galvanizing
its membership into an organization of formi-
dable power and influence, consistently at the
forefront of effective advocacy and social
change that results in equality and equity for
all citizens of the world.
In order to maintain its commitment to serv-
ant-leadership, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority
hosts an international conference every two
years.
On July 6–July 12, 2018, my fellow Sorors
from all around the world came to my home-
town in Houston to launch ‘‘New Dimensions
of Service by Celebrating a Legacy of Leader-
ship and Service.’’
At this conference Alpha Kappa Alpha So-
rority decided on new targets of focus for the
next two years, which include: HBCU for Life:
A Call to Action; Women’s Healthcare and
Wellness; Building Your Economic Legacy;
The Arts! and Global Impact.
February 2019 is Women’s Healthcare and
Wellness month.
To kick off Women’s Healthcare and
Wellness month, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority
has joined with the American Heart Associa-
tion in the fight against heart disease in order
to improve the health of all women.
On February 1, Alpha Kappa Alpha women
all over the world took off their pink and wore
red for the day to raise awareness of this
deadly disease for their ‘‘Pink Goes Red Im-
pact Day.’’
Alpha Kappa Alpha chapters are bringing
awareness to the devastating effects of heart
disease in communities around this country.
My chapter, Xi Alpha Omega hosted a
Zumba and Line Dancing Class at our Hous-
ton Texans YMCA to promote a fun and
healthy way to stay heart healthy.
As we observe Pink Goes Red Impact Day
and Heart Health month on the international
level, here are some unsettling truths about
heart disease and high blood pressure and
undeniable truths about prevention that can
help to stem the tide of this dreadful disease.
Cardiovascular diseases kill nearly 50,000
African-American women annually.
Forty-nine percent of African-American
women 20 years of age and older have heart
disease.
Only one in five African-American women
believes she is personally at risk.
Only 52 percent of African-American women
are aware of the signs and symptoms of a
heart attack.
Only 36 percent of African-American women
know that heart disease is their greatest
health risk.
These unsettling truths are the reason that
Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority has made Heart
Health and Wellness Month one of its most
important initiatives.
Although there is nothing that will 100 per-
cent guarantee a life without high blood pres-
sure and heart disease, there are several
things women can do every day to take steps
towards a healthier life.
Be honest about their health. There are sev-
eral things that can be done to reduce the risk
of heart disease: exercise regularly; eat
healthy; know your family medical history; and
monitor and treat pre-existing health condi-
tions.
Moderate salt and sodium intake and read
the label and be knowledgeable about what is
contained in the food consumed.
Commit to improving eating habits by devel-
oping a healthy diet and healthy cooking skills,

RECOGNIZING ALANNA ROHLING
AS THE ESCAMBIA COUNTY 2019–
2020 TEACHER OF THE YEAR
HON. MATT GAETZ
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 5, 2019
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I rise recog-
nize Alanna Rohling 2019–2020 Teacher of
the Year for Escambia County, Florida. Ms.
Rohling is a kindergarten teacher at Lincoln
Park Elementary School in Pensacola, FL.
Throughout her tenure as an educator, Ms.
Rohling has served the Escambia County
School District with a deep and unwavering
commitment to educational excellence.
It is recognized that the teaching profession
is one of the most difficult professions—yet
also one of the most rewarding. Ms. Rohling
continues to prove her devotion to her profes-
sion in a multitude of ways.
Her support and outreach extend far beyond
the walls of her kindergarten class. Even with
the demanding responsibilities of maintaining
a classroom, she also contributes to her
school and community. She is the Grade
Level Co-Chair, a member of school’s Leader-
ship Team, the STEM Committee Co-Chair,
and still makes time to be a Mentor Teacher
and a Student Mentor. She shares her time
and talents generously with all her students.
Generations of Ms. Rohling’s family have
also served as educators. A quote that holds
special meaning for her is: ‘‘A good education
is your child’s strongest tool for success’’—
and in her actions, Ms. Rohlings has certainly
helped equip all children with the educational
tools they need to succeed.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United
States Congress, I am privileged to recognize
Alanna Rohling for her tremendous accom-
plishments, and her many contributions to
education in the Escambia County School Dis-
trict.
I offer my heartfelt gratitude for her service.
I wish her all the best for her continued suc-
cess.

ROCKY MOUNTAIN REAGENTS
HON. ED PERLMUTTER
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 5, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Rocky Moun-
tain Reagents for receiving the 2019 West
Metro Chamber of Commerce’s Chairman’s
Award for Minority and Woman-Owned Busi-
ness of the Year.
Started in 1951 as S & K Reagents, Rocky
Mountain Reagents is a small but vital supplier
of chemical products to the medical and
healthcare community in the Denver Metro
area. Phyllis Sordelet purchased the company
in 1988 and rebranded it as Rocky Mountain
Reagents in 1996. During that time, it went
from a basement business to occupying a
20,000 sq. ft. facility and a preeminent sup-
plier of thousands of high-quality and custom
chemical products to industry sectors, includ-
ing aerospace, healthcare, law enforcement,
education, industrial laboratories, water treat-
ment, and bioscience.
This, of course, didn’t all happen by acci-
dent. It happened due to hard work and long
hours by Phyllis and her daughter, Elizabeth.
They worked tirelessly to cultivate lasting rela-
tionships with vendors, customers, and the
local business community. They have oper-
ated with the principles of integrity, teamwork,
and empowerment to become a resource part-
ner and ally in pursuit of each of their clients’
unique visions. They continue to grow and
thrive and are soon-to-break ground on a
26,000 sq. ft. expansion. Their commitment to
offering quality products, exceptional customer
service, and community-building philanthropy
has already made a different and will continue
to be felt in the years to come.
I extend my deepest congratulations to
Rocky Mountain Reagents for this well-de-
served recognition.

INTRODUCTION OF EASTERSEALS
100TH ANNIVERSARY RESOLUTION
HON. MARCY KAPTUR
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 5, 2019
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, it is my
pleasure to introduce today a resolution hon-
oring the 100th anniversary of the Easterseals.
On April 22, 2019, the Easterseals will cele-
brate 100 years as America’s first non-profit
organization to serve individuals with disabil-
ities and other special needs.
Once only focused on serving children with
special needs, Easterseals expanded its mis-
sion in the 1940s to serve children and adults.
For decades now, their innovative services
opened the doors to assist seniors, veterans
and individuals with autism.
The Easterseals had a tragic beginning. In
1907, a streetcar accident in Elyria, Ohio, took
the lives of eight people because there was no
local hospital to treat their injuries. One of the
deceased was the 18-year-old son of Edgar F.
Allen, who in his sorrow was inspired to raise
the funds necessary to build a local hospital.
18 months later, the Elyria Memorial Hospital
was built and opened with 32 beds.
Eight years after that, another Elyria hospital
opened for ‘‘crippled children.’’ On April 22,
1919, Mr. Allen organized with civic leaders
from Elyria, Cleveland, Sandusky, and Toledo,
Ohio and Detroit, Michigan to form the Ohio
Society for Crippled Children, the original
name of the Easterseals.
May the festivities of this 100th anniversary
year bring renewed faith and opportunity to
those aided by Easterseal services. Through
rehabilitation services, new and fulfilling life
opportunities become possible.
Let us all take inspiration in the words of
founder, Edgar F. Allen: ‘‘Your life and mine
shall be valued not by what we take . . . but
by what we give.’’ Congratulations to all asso-
ciated with such an important organization.
