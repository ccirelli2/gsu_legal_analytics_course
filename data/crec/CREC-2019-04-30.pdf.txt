fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker:
WASHINGTON, DC,

I hereby appoint the Honorable DEAN PHIL-
LIPS to act as Speaker pro tempore on this

RECOGNIZING THE CENTER FOR
ANIMAL REFERRAL AND EMER-
GENCY SERVICES AND DR. MAR-
THA LOW
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5
minutes.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize a veterinary
clinic and dedicated doctor in Bucks
County, Pennsylvania, both doing their
part to protect the health of service
dogs in our community.
Service dogs greatly assist members
of our community in innumerable
ways, providing companionship, help-
ing individuals with special needs, and
serving as therapy dogs.
Recognizing their importance, Dr.
Martha Low of the Center for Animal
Referral and Emergency Services, also
known as CARES, is offering free eye
exams to service dogs. These critical
exams protect the eyesight of these
animals and allow them to work in
nursing homes, schools, and other fa-
cilities where their services are needed.
I extend my sincerest appreciation to
CARES and to Dr. Low. Organized by
the American College of Veterinary
Ophthalmologists, Dr. Low is one of
over 300 doctors who perform this work
throughout the United States. We are
so grateful for all their work and their
service to our community.
RECOGNIZING THE DOMINIC LIPLES SCHOLARSHIP
FUND
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to honor an extraordinary
family and community from Bucks
County, Pennsylvania, that is working
to make our community a better place.
Earlier this month, Ciarlo Liples
threw out the first pitch at the base-
ball game between Central Bucks West
and Pennridge high schools. Ciarlo is
the brother of Dominic Liples, an 8-
year-old boy who tragically succumbed
to brain cancer in 2016.
Ciarlo and his family have since de-
veloped a close bond with the CB West
team and our entire community. The
Liples family has turned their tragedy
and grief into strength.
Working with this team, the family
helped establish the Dominic Liples
Scholarship Fund to award the senior
baseball player who represents
Dominic’s positive attitude and ability.
I applaud the Central Bucks High
School West team. We wish them all
continued success this season.
I would also like to extend all our
gratitude to the Liples family and give
Ciarlo and his parents, Ken and Kira,
our heartfelt thanks on behalf of every-
body in our community.
RECOGNIZING BOWEN’S BARBER SHOP
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize a small business
in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, for
helping kids in our community.
Bowen’s Barber Shop in Newtown re-
cently teamed up with the Bucks Coun-
ty Intermediate Unit to give five young
men with special needs haircuts for
their prom. In addition to their hair-
cuts, these students got the ability to
interact and independently commu-
nicate with their barber, giving them
real-world experience and confidence.
Bowen’s has been a longstanding, re-
spected business in Newtown, and I ap-
preciate their contributions to our
community.
I thank the owner of Bowen’s, Tracey
Bowen, for her generosity.
I would also like to extend my grati-
tude to Merri Kurman and the Bucks
County Intermediate Unit transition
program for their work in empowering
individuals with special needs.
Our community thanks each and
every one of these individuals and or-
ganizations.

BRING ARTICLES OF IMPEACH-
MENT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I
rise because I love my country.
Mr. Speaker, I have in my hand a
document styled ‘‘Report on the Inves-
tigation into Russian Interference in
the 2016 Presidential Election,’’ Special
Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III.
Mr. Speaker, I rise because this Con-
gress has a date with destiny. Mr.
Speaker, the tintinnabulation of his-
tory are sounding. The bells of history
are reminding us that we have a re-
sponsibility to our country that we
must take up.
I rise, Mr. Speaker, to announce that
I will bring Articles of Impeachment

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3308 April 30, 2019
against the President of the United
States of America for obstructing a
lawful investigation. I do so, Mr.
Speaker, because I will not put party
above people; I will not put politics
above principle; and I will not put this
President above the law.
Mr. Speaker, I don’t do this because
I want to. I do so because I have to. We
cannot allow the paralysis of analysis
to thwart the obstruction of justice
cause that must be brought before the
Congress. This is a day that we all
must start now to decide what our
votes will be because history demands
that we all take a stand.
I have not lobbied one person and
will not do so. I say to people: Vote
your conscience. But if you have read
this document, there are a good many
people who will conclude that the
President has obstructed a lawful in-
vestigation.
Mr. Speaker, there are people who
cannot say that I was right when I said
some 600-plus days ago that the Presi-
dent was engaging in obstruction, and
they will not say that I was wrong. But
to those people who can’t say that I am
wrong and will not say that I am right,
you know that I kept my word every
step of the way, and I am going to keep
my word today.
If this House does not bring these Ar-
ticles of Impeachment before this au-
gust body, each Member has the au-
thority and the opportunity to do so. I
will not allow history to show that this
Congress did not take a vote on the im-
peachment of a reckless, ruthless, law-
less President.
I absolutely believe that we must
honor our date with history.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
RECOGNIZING RICE ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Minnesota (Mr. EMMER) for 5 minutes.
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Rice Elementary
School for being authorized to teach
the Primary Years Program as an
International Baccalaureate World
School.
The International Baccalaureate pro-
gram takes an interdisciplinary ap-
proach, allowing children to learn and
collaborate in the classroom. This pro-
gram provides a unique learning expe-
rience to students, expanding their ho-
rizons and teaching them about our
larger world beyond our own borders.
I congratulate the teachers and ad-
ministrators at Rice Elementary. I
thank them for always going above and
beyond for their students and their
families.
I am proud to recognize Rice Elemen-
tary School as a leader in education in
our great State of Minnesota, the Edu-
cation State, and in Minnesota’s Sixth
Congressional District.
Congratulations again to the teach-
ers, administrators, and most impor-
tantly, the students and their families.
TRIBUTE TO RETIRED CHIEF PETTY OFFICER
ALAN DIX
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor retired Chief Petty Offi-
cer Alan Dix from Elk River, Min-
nesota, for his service to our country.
After serving 24 years in the Navy
and being stationed in Iraq, he con-
tinues to serve in our community.
Chief Petty Officer Dix is responsible
for creating the Spirit of Minnesota
Tribute Bell.
In partnership with Wells Fargo,
Alan and the Minnesota Assistance
Council for Veterans led the effort to
create the Tribute Bell to thank and
honor our servicemembers and vet-
erans for their sacrifices to our great
Nation.
Alan currently serves as the chair of
the Minnesota Veterans Team Mem-
bers Network, which is part of the Min-
nesota Assistance Council for Vet-
erans. The council helps veterans and
their families access employment,
housing, and legal assistance.
Through this organization, Alan
made the Spirit of Minnesota Tribute
Bell a reality. The bell embodies the
symbolism of respect that our commu-
nity has toward our military. Because
of their courage and valor, we are safer
and stronger as a country.
We are thankful for Alan. He reminds
us of how important it is to remember
and honor those who gave so much to
our Nation.
His service and all of his work on be-
half of our veterans and their families
is greatly appreciated.
RECOGNIZING MITCH EICKHOFF, 2019 SAUK RAPIDS
CITIZEN OF THE YEAR
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Mitch Eickhoff for
being named the 2019 Sauk Rapids Cit-
izen of the Year. Mitch is a lifelong
resident of Sauk Rapids and the Sauk
Rapids community. He is also a life-
long public servant.
Through his foundation, FGHC Ac-
tive, Mitch raises money by organizing
5K runs and other community events
for organizations like the Sauk Rapids
Fire Department, Tanner’s Team Foun-
dation, and Anna Marie’s Alliance.
Mitch’s charitable efforts also extend
well beyond the borders of Minnesota’s
Sixth Congressional District and the
State of Minnesota. Mitch has raised
money to support the Burn Violence
Survivors—Nepal, which helps with the
recovery process for burn victims in
South Asia. He has also supported com-
munities in Malawi, Africa, raising
money for healthcare, education, and
the environment.
Mitch’s work to serve people in our
community and beyond deserves rec-
ognition. Our district and our constitu-
ents all benefit from his passion to
serve others.
I thank Mitch for making an excep-
tional impact on our community.
RIGHTEOUS AMONG THE NATIONS
RECOGNITION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. PETERS) for 5 minutes.
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today, a day before Yom HaShoah, or
Holocaust Remembrance Day, to recog-
nize the late Cornelis and Wilhelmina
de Ru.
In 1940, Nazi forces invaded the Neth-
erlands, and days later, the Dutch were
forced to surrender. Throughout the
next 5 years, the de Ru family risked
everything to save the life of a young
Jewish teenager, Maurits Kopuit. He
was only one of two survivors in his
family.
The de Rus understood the great risk
involved in shielding Maurits, yet they
displayed unyielding courage in their
effort to save a fellow citizen.
During the Holocaust, the Nazis sys-
tematically killed 6 million Jews. How-
ever, throughout this nightmare, there
were a few like the de Rus who refused
to allow dark forces to prevail.
This past Sunday, Mr. and Mrs. de Ru
were named Righteous Among the Na-
tions for their heroic efforts to protect
Mr. Maurits Kopuit from the Nazi re-
gime during World War II.
Righteous Among the Nations is a
special designation by Yad Vashem,
the World Holocaust Remembrance
Center, that conveys the gratitude of
the State of Israel and of the Jewish
people for those who took risks to save
Jews during the Holocaust.
As of January 2018, Yad Vashem had
recognized over 26,000 people from 51
different countries with the Righteous
Among the Nations designation. Their
names appear on the Mount of Remem-
brance in Jerusalem. It is an unprece-
dented tribute by victims to those who
stood by their sides.
Next week marks the 74th anniver-
sary of the Nazi army’s surrender. We
must never forget the consequences of
remaining silent in the face of evil and
intolerance.
Please join me in honoring the de
Rus’ selfless actions and commemo-
rating all those whose lives were lost.
HONORING THE LIFE OF STAN SMITH
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the late Stan
Smith, an exemplary historian from
Rancho Bernardo whose help made the
San Diego Veterans History Project
possible.
Stan’s brother, Charlie, was killed
during the invasion of Sicily in 1943
during World War II. This prompted
Stan himself to join the U.S. Navy and
later prompted his interest in record-
ing veterans’ accounts of their service
during World War II and the Vietnam
war.
Stan began helping my office in 2013
and worked with us for 3 years before
going to help the San Diego Veterans
Museum.

the 7 years since he began, ensuring
that their stories would never be for-
gotten.
Stan understood the importance of
passing history down from one genera-
tion to the next and thanking the men
and women who, like Stan, served our
country.
We are deeply grateful for Stan
Smith’s commitment to recording vet-
erans’ stories. His work has ensured
that their stories will never be lost.
Please join me in honoring Stan Smith
and his children, who plan to carry on
the work their father started.
Mr. Speaker, if there are any San
Diegans who are interested in becom-
ing involved with the Veterans History
Project, I hope they will contact my of-
fice.
CONGRATULATING RESMED
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate ResMed, a med-
ical device company located in my dis-
trict, for receiving the 2019 Duane Roth
Renaissance Award.
Duane Roth was a champion of life
sciences and tech entrepreneurship. He
was a beloved community leader who
defined San Diego’s innovation eco-
system and economic diversity.
Every year, the Duane Roth Award is
given to a company whose inventions
and breakthroughs have improved the
world around us. ResMed has combined
groundbreaking sleep and respiratory
medicine with technology to increase
the accessibility and availability of
treatment for those with sleep apnea
and other chronic diseases. This year,
ResMed is recognized for its commit-
ment to improving quality of life, re-
ducing the risk of chronic disease, and
increasing access to healthcare.
ResMed exemplifies the innovation
and discovery of San Diego, and I am
proud to celebrate a San Diego com-
pany that has worked tirelessly to bet-
ter healthcare on this well-deserved
honor.
f
DANIEL DESNOYERS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. KHANNA) for 5 minutes.
Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to tell the sad story of Daniel
Desnoyers, who took his own life be-
cause he did not have the money to buy
the basic drugs that he needed for his
mental health issues.
Daniel Desnoyers was a young man
who struggled with depression and psy-
chosis, mental health issues that show
no physical symptoms but take a deep
psychological toll on those whom they
afflict.
Daniel did the right thing. He pur-
chased health insurance through the
New York health insurance market-
place from Fidelis, a subsidiary of mas-
sive international conglomerate
Centene Corporation.
In March, Daniel went to the phar-
macy to refill his prescription for
risperidone, an antipsychotic medica-
tion that he needed. He was informed
by the pharmacy that he no longer had
health insurance and the 1-month refill
would cost him $250.
Now, to some people, $250 may not
seem like a lot of money, but to Daniel
it was. According to a 2018 study by the
Federal Reserve, 40 percent of Ameri-
cans would not be able to cover an un-
expected $400 expense. Daniel, unfortu-
nately, was one of them.
So he did not buy the medicine, and
he began to ration his antipsychotic
medicine, taking it every other day
until he could get his insurance back.
He contacted his provider, Fidelis, at
the beginning of April when he learned
that they had canceled his plan be-
cause he missed a $20 payment.
Fidelis didn’t immediately reinstate
the plan. Instead, the company in-
formed him that his coverage would
not resume until May 1. This meant
another month without a refill of his
prescription, another month without
the medicine Daniel needed to func-
tion. His ration of medicine had run
out.
On April 9, filled with thoughts of
suicide—a listed side effect for
antipsychotic drug withdrawal—Daniel
superglued his seatbelt shut, posted a
farewell message on Facebook, and
drove his truck into the river, ending
his life.
Daniel Desnoyers died at the age of
29 because he was late paying $20 to a
corporation that pulled in more than
$60 billion in 2018.
Something is deeply wrong in this
country where we let a young man die
because he cannot afford medicine that
he needs and when his insurance is
taken away because of a $20 missed
payment. Daniel died because we have
a system that puts profits over pa-
tients.
A healthcare system that does not
guarantee basic care for all people is a
healthcare system that is broken.
Medicare for All could have prevented
Daniel’s death, and it could prevent the
death of so many others. LLOYD DOG-
GETT’s pharmaceutical bill that would
hold these pharmaceutical companies
accountable could have prevented Dan-
iel’s death.
Twenty-eight million Americans are
still uninsured, and millions more are
saddled with high deductibles and high
premium plans which lead them to
forgo the care they need. Medicare for
All is the plan that will guarantee
every American the basic care that
they have a right to.
Daniel Desnoyers wasn’t a perfect
man and he didn’t lead a perfect life,
but he tried, and our Nation owes it to
him and others like him to make sure
that they have the medicine they need
to live with dignity.
I will continue to fight for Daniel, for
his father, for his family, and for all
Americans.

derstanding of Your divine truth, that
they might wisely lead us along paths

this diverse gathering. By them, make
our Nation one body, ready to do Your
will—with eyes to look upon the suf-
fering in compassion, voices to speak
love and affirmation to the dehuman-
ized, hands and feet to go out and es-
tablish Your peace and justice for all,
not just a few.
Offering ourselves and these prayers

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3310 April 30, 2019
Hardy Kim of Sunnyvale Presbyterian
Church, which is in my district.
Since 1956, Sunnyvale Presbyterian
Church has stood for peace and justice
in Silicon Valley. Pastor Kim began his
service there 2 years ago, hoping to
unite our diverse community and deliv-
ering spiritual comfort to the least for-
tunate.
His work is important for those fami-
lies struggling to find affordable hous-
ing and keep up with the rising cost of
living often overlooked in Silicon Val-
ley’s soaring wealth.
He also is an immigrant success
story. He came here with his parents
from South Korea to Detroit and later
received a bachelor’s degree from Har-
vard and a law degree from the Univer-
sity of Michigan. After a year as a
Presbyterian mission volunteer in Bel-
fast, Northern Ireland, he felt called to
church ministry.
I have been honored to participate in
dialogues he has led in the community
on immigration and gun control. I have
learned a lot from him about history.
He recently told me that our separa-
tion of powers—such an important con-
cept today—is inspired in part by the
Presbyterian Church, and that one of
my favorite Presidents, Woodrow Wil-
son, apparently remarked that the
highest honor of his life was not being
President of the United States, but it
was being an elder in the Presbyterian
Church.
Pastor Kim has become a reliable and
trusted voice in Silicon Valley. I am
very proud to introduce him to the
House and honored that he would grace
us with the opening prayer.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

POWAY SHOOTING
(Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend her remarks.)
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam
Speaker, on Saturday, as members of
our Jewish community in San Diego
and all over the world observed the
final day of Passover, a 19-year-old
chose hate. He stormed into the
Chabad of Poway synagogue, shooting
at the congregation, leaving beloved
community member Lori Gilbert Kaye
dead and three more wounded.
The congregation’s brave rabbi,
Yisroel Goldstein, reflected: ‘‘I do not
know why I had to witness scenes of a
pogrom in San Diego County like the
ones my grandparents experienced in
Poland. . . . I don’t know why I had to
see my good friend . . . hunted in her
house of worship.’’
This Thursday, Madam Speaker, is
Israel’s Yom HaShoah, a day to com-
memorate the Holocaust and the 6 mil-
lion Jews who were murdered for being
Jewish.
We are reminded of the hate, bigotry,
and intolerance that we continue to
face today, whether it be in San Diego,
Sri Lanka, Christchurch, or Pitts-
burgh.
Hate and violence had no place then
and still do not today. We need to say
‘‘never again’’ and act.
f
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF SENATOR RICHARD LUGAR
(Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam
Speaker, today, I rise to honor the life
and legacy of a truly great Hoosier who
dedicated his life to making the world
a better and safer place for generations
to come. Senator Richard Lugar passed
away over the weekend, with his dear
family by his side, at the age of 78.
The Richard G. Lugar Plaza in Indi-
anapolis is just one tribute to the truly
great statesman and public servant
role model he was to so many people,
including to myself. He served our
Navy proudly. He was the mayor of In-
dianapolis and the longest tenured
Member of Congress from Indiana.
He worked brilliantly and in a bipar-
tisan fashion not only on security
issues but also compassionately on
those issues that impacted Americans
every day, including food security both
at home and around the globe, edu-
cation for young people, energy inde-
pendence, and free trade. He skillfully
navigated foreign policy matters and
earned a Medal of Freedom for success-
fully convincing the former Soviet
Union to dismantle their weapons at
the end of the Cold War.
No matter the topic at hand, he al-
ways made time for the next genera-
tion, to teach and inspire young Hoo-
siers to serve their country and to re-
mind all of us that we have more in
common as Americans than we do dif-
ferences.
We will miss his wisdom and his
gentle smile dearly, but his legacy will
endure for generations to come.
f
CLIMATE CHANGE
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam
Speaker, this week, the House will pass
major legislation to reassert America’s
leadership on climate change.
America’s leadership on this issue
cannot be more urgent and needed. The
current administration has ignored the
consensus of scientists and the need to
act in a responsible manner.
Nearly 50 years ago on the first Earth
Day, tens of millions of Americans de-
manded change from their government.
Later that year, seven major pieces of
legislation were signed into law—the
Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act,
and the Safe Drinking Water Act—with
overwhelming bipartisan support.
Last week was Earth Day, and I saw
firsthand that my community of west-
ern New York continues to lead to con-
front this challenge. With students
finding ways to reduce the carbon foot-
print, Re-Tree Western New York cele-
brated 30,000 new tree plantings, and
the Western New York Land Conser-
vancy is preserving green space for
generations to come.
Now Congress needs to follow this ex-
ample and restore America’s leadership
role on the environment.
f
MONTH OF THE MILITARY CHILD
(Mr. GREEN of Tennessee asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the
Month of the Military Child. I married
the daughter of an Army retired com-
bat veteran. She was born just after
her father got to Vietnam. My children
are, of course, military children.
Several years ago, I was on a friend’s
Facebook page. He had died fighting
for our country in Afghanistan. The
last post on his Facebook page read: ‘‘I
love you and miss you . . . Daddy.’’
Her dad had signed up to go to war,
but she never did.
Who will teach her to dance?
Who will drop her off at college?
Who will walk that young girl down
the aisle?
Our military children’s sacrifices can
never be properly measured and never
compensated, but we must do all we
can to honor them.

GOODNESS IN ACTION IN TUCSON,
ARIZONA
(Mrs. KIRKPATRICK asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Madam Speak-
er, I am standing here today to recog-
nize my southern Arizona community.
While in Tucson for the work period, I
saw goodness in action. The city of
Tucson, the county, Catholic Commu-
nity Services, and other local churches
and nonprofits came together with
open arms and hearts to welcome and
care for the hundreds of families seek-
ing asylum across our southern border.
With limited resources and fleeting
time, southern Arizonans stepped up to
provide shelter, transportation, food,
clothing, and childcare. City volun-
teers ran with little children who
hadn’t played in weeks and weeks.
The families fleeing their birthplace
journeyed to the United States for a
safer and better life for their children.
Their stories are gut-wrenching, and
the response I have seen and heard
from the Tucson community has been
unparalleled.
No walls or cages, I saw goodness in
action. We must come together like
Tucson to find humane and proactive
solutions to help these families.

April 30, 2019
HONORING LIAM MAGATHAN
(Mr. WATKINS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. WATKINS. Madam Speaker,
today, I rise in honor of Liam
Magathan of Meriden, Kansas, whom I
awarded last week the Silver Congres-
sional Award Medal.
Liam is a student at the University
of Kansas. Through years of hard work,
dedication, and personal sacrifice,
Liam has achieved this prestigious
honor.
I want to let Liam know how much I
look up to him and how the world
would be a better place if more people
were like him.
Keep up the good work, my friend.
You are bringing pride upon yourself,
Kansas, and the United States of Amer-
ica.

MOURNING THE LOSS OF
REVEREND HOWARD HAYWOOD
(Mr. KENNEDY asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to join Myrtle Baptist
Church, the Newton community, and
the entire Commonwealth of Massachu-
setts in mourning the loss of Reverend
Howard Haywood.
A little over a year ago, I walked
into Myrtle Baptist with my family,
and Reverend Haywood welcomed us
with a warm embrace that few could
match. It was that physical, emotional
embrace that countless congregants
and visitors will never forget.
With eight generations of his family
calling Newton home, the reverend
liked to talk about how the city shaped
him. If anything, our city stands
kinder, stronger, and more just because
of him.
A journeyman bricklayer and con-
struction worker for five decades, he
literally built Massachusetts into what
it is today. Yet he still felt like he had
more to offer, so he spent the little free
time he found fighting for affordable
housing and civil rights for his fellow
citizens.
To his wife, Katy; his daughter,
Kristen; his son, Howard, Jr.; and the
entire Haywood family, please know
how grateful we are that you shared
this magnificent man with all of us.

RISING FOR LORI SMITH AND
COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING
(Ms. HOULAHAN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Speaker,
today I rise for Lori Smith of Pennsyl-
vania, a member of my community who
passed away last month after a very
long and hard-fought battle with stage
IV colorectal cancer.
When she first received her diagnosis,
Lori learned that several of the symp-
toms that she had been experiencing
had been there for over a decade. So,
Lori stood up. She harnessed the power
of social media and advocacy to share
her story with the world, to stand up
and fight for her life and the lives of all
those affected by this insidious disease.
We met with Lori’s husband, Kenny,
here in Washington to hear of her
brave fight and of their tireless work
to make sure that other families never
have to go through the pain that they
went through.
That was March 19. Lori passed away
on March 20.
I refuse to let Lori’s death and the
thousands of cancer-related deaths go
unnoticed. I cosponsored H.R. 1570, the
Colorectal Cancer Screening Act,
which would waive Medicare’s cost-
sharing requirements for preventive
screening of colonoscopies.
I urge the House and the Senate to
pass this bipartisan and lifesaving leg-
islation.
As we continue to search for a cure,
the greatest tool at our disposal is al-
ways early diagnosis. No one in our
country should ever have to forego life-
saving screenings.
And to all my fellow Americans bat-
tling cancer, I will not stop fighting for
you.
f
STAGGERING COST OF INSULIN
(Mr. RUSH asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to highlight the staggering cost
of insulin.
A study published last September es-
timated that manufacturers could
charge between $7 and $11 for insulin
and still make a profit. In reality,
Madam Speaker, the list price today is
$275 a vial.
This is an unconscionable markup on
a critical, lifesaving drug, as diabetes
is the primary cause of death for 85,000
Americans each and every year.
While insurance covers some of the
costs, insulin is, all too often,
unaffordable for the 17,000 Medicare
beneficiaries in my district who depend
on it to survive. That is because it can
cost a senior on Medicare living in my
hometown over $1,400 a year to pay for
their diabetes medication.
To combat this issue, I introduced
the Insulin Access for All Act. My leg-
islation ensures that Medicare and
Medicaid recipients pay nothing out of
pocket for their insulin.
I urge my colleagues to join with me
in reducing the cost of insulin for all
Americans.
f
TEENAGE SUICIDE
(Mr. CÁRDENAS asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. CÁRDENAS. Madam Speaker, I
have the honor of helping an American
citizen familiarize herself with our
United States Capitol—with her United
States Capitol. Sophia is here with her
eighth grade class from St. Philip The
Apostle Catholic School in Pasadena,
California.
I felt it important for her to under-
stand that we do listen, so I asked her
before I gave this speech: What comes
to mind? What issue would you like me
to mention?
She thought, and she thought, and
she said: Teenage suicide rates are way
too high.
You had better believe it, America.
They are. And there are many things
we can do, both locally and here in
Washington, to make sure that we cur-
tail that and make sure that young
people don’t find themselves in the po-
sition to do such a thing to themselves,
their family, and their community.
I pledged to Sophia that many of us
here in Washington are committed to
doing what we can to make sure that
suicide rates in general, but specifi-
cally suicide rates amongst young peo-
ple, are curtailed and they hopefully
stop and come down to zero soon.
I thank Sophia for visiting us, and I
thank her teachers and all of those who
brought her here today.
f
THANKING USO FOR ITS COMMIT-
MENT TO AMERICAN SERVICE-
MEMBERS
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, the USO is on Capitol
Hill today for a service project where
volunteers can assemble care packages
for servicemembers who are currently
deployed.
More than 2,000 care packages will be
assembled today as part of the Force
Behind the Forces campaign.
The USO strengthens America’s mili-
tary servicemembers by keeping them
connected to family, home, and coun-
try throughout their service to the Na-
tion.
The USO has more than 200 locations
around the globe. It serves 4.9 million
Active-Duty Guard, Reserve, and mem-
bers of their families.
For more than 75 years, the USO has
been by the side of America’s military
servicemembers. From the moment
they join, through their assignments
and deployments, and as they transi-
tion back to their communities, the
USO has been there.
The USO has delivered more than 2.6
million care packages since the Care
Package Program was established in
2003. In 2018, the USO delivered 120,000
care packages to servicemembers
across the globe.
Madam Speaker, I thank the USO for
its dedication to our servicemembers
and their families. As a military fam-
ily, as an individual who has visited
theaters of war, I see what a difference
this makes, and I thank them for their
service.

H3312 April 30, 2019
CLIMATE CHANGE
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, climate
change is already exacting a dramatic
toll: extreme weather, unprecedented
migration, and untold suffering.
Meanwhile, the administration de-
nies basic science, and President
Trump wants to pull the United States
out of the Paris Agreement.
But the American people—and the
world—reject this approach. As Pope
Francis has written: ‘‘We must regain
the conviction that we need one an-
other, that we have a shared responsi-
bility for others and the world, and
that being good and decent are worth
it.’’
When everyone from the Pope to the
Pentagon warns us that we are in a cri-
sis, it is clearly time to act.
This week we consider H.R. 9, the Cli-
mate Action Now Act. This legislation
will keep us in the Paris Agreement,
along with more than 180 other coun-
tries; require the President to develop
real emissions plans; and recommit the
United States to global climate leader-
ship.
My eldest son and daughter are ex-
pecting a child, and I have a 7-year-old
granddaughter. I want them to know
clean air and pure water.
I also want them to understand that
we did everything we could to protect
this wondrous planet for them and for
generations to come.
I thank Representative CASTOR for
her leadership, and I urge Members to
support the bill.

ENCOURAGING GREATER PUBLIC-
PRIVATE SECTOR COLLABORA-
TION TO PROMOTE FINANCIAL
LITERACY FOR STUDENTS AND
YOUNG ADULTS.
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I
move to suspend the rules and pass the
resolution (H. Res. 327) encouraging
greater public-private sector collabora-
tion to promote financial literacy for
students and young adults, as amend-
ed.
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion.
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 327
Whereas personal financial literacy is es-
sential to ensuring that individuals are pre-
pared to make informed decisions about
budgeting, financial planning, wealth accu-
mulation, higher education loans, 529 savings
plans, managing credit cards, and managing
other debt;
Whereas often young people are ill-
equipped to handle major financial decisions
in an increasingly complex financial market-
place;
Whereas personal financial management
skills begin to develop during childhood;
Whereas, according to the report of the
Girl Scout Research Institute entitled ‘‘Hav-
ing it All: Girls and Financial Literacy’’,
only 12 percent of girls feel very confident
about making financial decisions;
Whereas the move away from traditional
pensions and toward defined contribution
plans requires more financial education, so
workers need to be equipped with the finan-
cial aptitude to not only save and accumu-
late assets, but also to turn those assets into
lifetime income;
Whereas the Council for Economic Edu-
cation found that only 22 States require high
schools to offer some type of personal fi-
nance course and only 17 States require that
course for high school graduation;
Whereas a longitudinal research study by
the University of Arizona found that high
school and college students who have been
exposed to ongoing financial education show
an increase in financial knowledge;
Whereas the 2015 National Financial Capa-
bility Study, developed in consultation with
the Department of the Treasury and Presi-
dent’s Advisory Council on Financial Capa-
bility, updates key measures from the 2009
National Financial Capability Study of
American adults and deepens the exploration
of topics that are highly relevant today, in-
cluding student loans and medical debt;
Whereas the Federal Reserve System offers
publications in English and Spanish that
provide consumers tips on a broad range of
topics, from avoiding mortgage foreclosure
scams to managing a checking account;
Whereas a study conducted by Daniel
Fernandes, John G. Lynch, Jr., and Richard
Netemeyer entitled ‘‘Financial Literacy, Fi-
nancial Education and Downstream Finan-
cial Behaviors’’ found that it ‘‘is best to pro-
vide assistance just before a decision is made
in what is known as ‘just-in-time edu-
cation’ ’’; and
Whereas on September 6, 2018, the U.S.
House of Representatives passed, by a vote of
406 to 4, H.R. 1635, the Empowering Students
Through Enhanced Financial Counseling
Act, which helps improve financial aid coun-
seling for students receiving a Pell Grant or
a Federal loan: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives—
(1) emphasizes the importance of raising
awareness of individual financial capability
by providing relevant information, financial
workshops, and other decision-making tools
to consumers of all ages;
(2) supports the efforts of Federal financial
agencies to partner with organizations that
are focused on developing opportunities for
minorities and women to place talented
young minorities and women in industry in-
ternships, summer employment, and full-
time positions;
(3) supports the efforts of the Federal fi-
nancial agencies to provide consumers with
relevant information and decision-making
tools regarding important financial deci-
sions; and
(4) urges the Department of the Treasury
to consult with the Financial Industry Regu-
latory Authority and implement future na-
tional financial capability studies.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Il-
linois (Mr. FOSTER) and the gentleman
from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each will
control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Illinois.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks on this
legislation and to insert extraneous
material thereon.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois?
There was no objection.
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
H. Res. 327, a bipartisan resolution we
introduced in April in honor of Finan-
cial Literacy Month.
I would like to start by thanking my
friend Congressman FRENCH HILL from
Arkansas, who should truly be consid-
ered as an original cosponsor of this
resolution for working on this legisla-
tion with me.
The aim of this resolution is simple
but important. It encourages collabora-
tion between the public and private
sector to promote financial literacy for
students. It emphasizes the importance
of financial literacy for consumers of
all ages, and it supports efforts of Fed-
eral agencies to expand financial edu-
cation resources.
This year alone, approximately 15.1
million students will be in grades 9
through 12 and almost 20 million stu-
dents will be enrolled in colleges and
universities.
That is a lot of young people who will
soon be entering a complex financial
marketplace where they will have to
quickly make important financial deci-
sions. These include decisions about
paying for college, credit cards, financ-
ing a car or a home purchase, preparing
for unexpected emergencies, and saving
for retirement.
However, without an understanding
of basic financial concepts, these young
people will not be well equipped to
make these decisions.
At a time when student loan balances
stand at $1.5 trillion and a majority of
private workers have access to defined
contribution plans and not traditional
pension benefits, it is even more impor-
tant for young people and workers to
be financially literate.
Part of the problem is that too few
schools incorporate financial education
into their curriculum. According to the
Council for Economic Education, only
a third of States require high school
students to take a course in personal
finance. In those States, most schools
teach the subject as one portion of an-
other course of study—such as math,
economics, or social studies—while
only five States require a semester-
long, standalone personal finance
course.
Studies show that financial illiteracy
carries significant cost. Consumers
who fail to understand the concept of

compound interest spend more on
transaction fees, run up bigger debts,
and incur higher interest rates on
loans.
We also need to work on making fi-
nancial literacy tools available for ev-
eryone. Unfortunately, levels of finan-
cial literacy are lower among the less
educated minorities and women.
Just 19 percent of high school grad-
uates possess basic financial knowledge
and skills. Perhaps even more trou-
bling, according to a survey by the
Consumer Federation of America and
the Financial Planning Association, 21
percent of respondents, including 38
percent of those with income below
$25,000, reported that winning the lot-
tery was ‘‘the most practical strategy
for accumulating several hundred thou-
sand dollars for their own retirement.’’
This is a tragedy in the making, and
we can do better.
While Americans are not expected to
manage their own legal cases or med-
ical conditions, they are expected to
manage their own finances.
We teach our children to wear seat
belts. We teach them to say no to
drugs. We should also be teaching them
the financial literacy skills that they
will need to successfully navigate the
financial marketplace.
We want to give young people and all
consumers the tools they need to sur-
vive. One of the ways in which we can
do that is by having Federal agencies
partner with schools, local and State
governments, workplaces, community
organizations, nonprofits, and financial
service providers.
Whether it is giving students
immersive opportunities to see how
money and banking work in the real
world or helping train and equip teach-
ers with the curriculum and materials
they need to succeed in the classroom,
Federal agencies should be bold and in-
novative in their approaches and lever-
age the ways in which technology can
be used to further these laudable goals.
We cannot afford to have future gen-
erations of Americans grow up without
learning these fundamental skills. For
that reason, I urge all my colleagues to
support this resolution.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
I thank Madam Speaker for the op-
portunity to speak on this important
resolution, H. Res. 327, and I want to
thank my good friend from Illinois, Dr.
FOSTER, for his passion on this measure
to benefit, particularly, the young peo-
ple in this country.
Certainly, as the most prominent
Ph.D. in the House of Representatives
and a pioneering entrepreneur, he
knows the value of financial literacy.
And I am proud, as a former commu-
nity banker and investment manager,
somebody who dealt with families,
their kids, and older Americans for 30
years in finance, to partner on this
very important promotion of financial
literacy for students and young adults.
It is wonderful that it is a bipartisan
effort by our committee.
And it is truly unfortunate, Madam
Speaker, that only 25 States require
high school students to take a finan-
cial literacy class in order to graduate.
As a result, many children and adoles-
cents grow into adults who don’t know
how to properly save, spend, and budg-
et.
I am proud that Arkansas is one of
those 25 States, Madam Speaker, as we
enacted our requirement back in 2005.
But, going back even further to 1962,
Arkansas, through the leadership of
Bessie Moore, a remarkable educator
in our State, created something called
Economics Arkansas, which, every
summer, puts on financial literacy
training for all of our teachers, K
through 12, so that they understand to
put financial literacy in all the class-
rooms.
It was a lot of fun last week when we
were in the district to go to Robinson
Senior High School in Little Rock and
see them compete for the Stock Mar-
ket Game, which is a major component
in financial literacy training, through
Economics Arkansas.
b 1230
So not everyone, every student is as
lucky as an Arkansan, because two-
thirds of Americans can’t pass a finan-
cial literacy test, Madam Speaker.
Forty-four percent do not have enough
savings to cover a $400 emergency, and
33 percent have not saved for their re-
tirement.
Financial illiteracy has broader eco-
nomic costs, higher debt, limited sav-
ings. For many, this limits their home-
ownership. This means they don’t have
a stable retirement. And for many of
our young adults, this critical knowl-
edge creates the burden that we have
seen in student loan lending in this
country where families are not treat-
ing higher education debt as seriously
as they treat buying that first house.
Why is that, Madam Speaker? It is
because of the lack, in my view, of fi-
nancial literacy at the high school
level, at our admissions offices in col-
leges, and that is why it was terrific,
bipartisan, that this time last year in
the last Congress, in September, we
passed, with over 400 votes in this
House, a measure that requires finan-
cial literacy training for students seek-
ing a student loan, for students accept-
ing a Pell grant. That is the kind of
good work that this House has been
doing.
I want to again thank my friend, Mr.
FOSTER, for his work. As we close Fi-
nancial Literacy Month, I can’t think
of a better topic, and I can’t think of a
better friend to share that work with.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. DAVID SCOTT).
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding me this time.
The first thing I want to say is thank
you to Mr. FOSTER and thank you to
Mr. HILL for providing sterling, bipar-
tisan leadership on this, Madam Speak-
er, what I feel is one of the most press-
ing needs facing our Nation today, and
that is to equip our young people with
the financial education, the financial
acumen of navigating what is becoming
even a greater, more complex financial
system.
Madam Speaker, let me just bring
this glaring statistic to drive home
this point to you, the Congress, and the
American people.
According to the Council for Eco-
nomic Education, just 17 States out of
the 50 States of our great Nation re-
quire students to take even one course
in personal finance. Just 22 States re-
quire high school students to take a
course in just basic economics, and
then that course is interloped into oth-
ers and not even in and of itself.
Yet the financial decisions that our
young people are asked to make are
immense, carrying lifelong con-
sequences to consider in the decision,
first of all, of whether to go to college
or not, how to go to college, how to pay
for it, and how to pay for the increas-
ing costly debt for this college edu-
cation.
Consider the challenges that can
come from balancing a starting or be-
ginning wage against the student loan
debt or saving for retirement. Or con-
sider many of the basic kitchen table
choices that families must make each
and every day to put food on the table,
to buy or not to buy an automobile,
just the simple electricity bill. They
would have to make definite choices.
Consider the advantages that are af-
forded to consumers who do have ac-
cess to credit, how important that is.
How do you acquire that access, and
how do you maintain that access for
credit?
We are, indeed, a financial consumer
economy, but we are basically a credit-
based economy, and our young people
must gravitate and be able to grapple
with this in a responsible way.
In our increasingly complex financial
marketplace, the value of financial
education has never been higher. Per-
sonal education is badly needed.
To reduce debt, we would look at the
debt that so many of our young people
start out with year after year even fin-
ishing college. How do you manage
that? How do you make those choices?
Financial literacy is the key to fi-
nancial security not just of the indi-
vidual, because if we don’t have finan-
cial security for the people of our Na-
tion, we don’t have financial security
for the future of this great Nation.
That is why this is one of the most im-
portant issues that this Congress faces
today.
I am so proud to join with my Repub-
lican friend and my Democratic friend
in showing the bipartisan way that we
must go to solve this problem and
make sure that this generation and
every generation coming after them
have the best financial education.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:

the end the following:
‘‘(k) SENIOR INVESTOR TASKFORCE.—
‘‘(1) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established

April 30, 2019
(c) SENIOR CITIZEN DEFINED.—For purposes
of this section, the term ‘‘senior citizen’’
means an individual over the age of 65.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Il-
linois (Mr. FOSTER) and the gentleman
from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each will
control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Illinois.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days within which to
revise and extend their remarks on this
legislation and to insert extraneous
material thereon.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois?
There was no objection.
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to sup-
port H.R. 1876, the Senior Security Act
of 2019, a bipartisan bill introduced by
Congressman GOTTHEIMER and Con-
gressman HOLLINGSWORTH.
The financial exploitations of senior
citizens is a major problem today, and
with the aging of the baby boomer gen-
eration, it will only get worse in the
coming years.
By 2030, one in five persons in the
U.S. is projected to be 65 or older. That
would equal approximately 75 million
people who are senior citizens.
It is also estimated that nearly one
in five Americans over the age of 65
have been a victim of financial exploi-
tation. This can take many forms, in-
cluding being steered towards inappro-
priate investment, paying unreason-
ably high fees for financial services, or
outright fraud.
Senior citizens are often targeted be-
cause they are more likely to suffer
from problems of memory and judg-
ment, making them vulnerable to
fraud. Exacerbating the issue is that
the overwhelming majority of inci-
dents of elder financial exploitation go
unreported to authorities.
The Senior Security Act would help
combat elder financial abuse by cre-
ating a task force in the SEC to iden-
tify the challenges that senior inves-
tors encounter and areas in which sen-
ior investors would benefit from
changes to SEC regulations.
The bill also requires that the GAO
conduct a study on the financial ex-
ploitation of senior citizens. The GAO
study would give us an important com-
prehensive look at this issue, including
a breakdown of the economic costs of
financial exploitation of senior citi-
zens, answers to how often this hap-
pens, why such abuses often go unre-
ported, and factors that contribute to
an increased risk of exploitation.
Americans work hard over their life-
time in order to save for retirement
and be financially safe and secure when
they get older. Unscrupulous people
and companies would take advantage
of these senior citizens and rob them of
their hard-earned money. Those people
and companies should not be able to
get away with such egregious behavior.
This bill would allow us to more ef-
fectively combat this growing problem.
For that reason, I want to thank the
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.
GOTTHEIMER) and the gentleman from
Indiana (Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH) for
bringing this bipartisan initiative for-
ward. I urge all Members to vote ‘‘yes.’’
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support, as
well, of H.R. 1876, the Senior Security
Act, and I want to thank my friends
and colleagues, the gentleman from
New Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER) and the
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. HOL-
LINGSWORTH), for their collaboration
and work on this important bipartisan
legislation, all focused on protecting
our seniors.
Madam Speaker, America’s capital
markets are open. They are innovative,
and they are essential for our families.
That is how we live the American
Dream. We can grow a nest egg that
helps us for our retirement, helps put
our kids or grandkids through college,
or helps buy a home.
But as Americans age, they become
more critical to the success of those
open, transparent, and vibrant capital
markets because those Americans over
50, Madam Speaker, roughly, have 77
percent of the financial assets in our
country.
So when bad actors violate our laws
and regulations, commit fraud, or ex-
ploit our senior Americans or their
families, the integrity of those trans-
parent and open markets and the op-
portunity of that American Dream are
threatened.
To that end, protecting senior inves-
tors and preventing such behavior
within our financial system is a shared
goal. H.R. 1876 protects senior investors
and will help the SEC reduce increas-
ing instances of financial exploitation.
It will create an interdivisional task
force at the SEC to examine and iden-
tify challenges facing senior investors.
I have to say, Madam Speaker, over
two decades of working in the invest-
ment world and working with the SEC
and working with FINRA, the regu-
latory body for broker-dealers and in-
vestment advisers, their efforts of
sweep exams and the education of the
responsibilities of investment advisers
are critical.
b 1245
This will give them more tools to
identify what the gaps are today.
I would add, in my career, that gap
extends way beyond financial advisers
to CPAs, lawyers, people in a position
of trust that advise and guide over
Americans.
It is shocking for us to report that
$36 billion each year are lost to finan-
cial scams in this country and that one
out of five seniors have reported being
victims of exploitation.
Many States are taking action on
their own. According to the National
Conference of State Legislators: ‘‘The
number of bills introduced by State
legislators to combat elder financial
exploitation increased by over 57 per-
cent in 3 years.’’
So this bipartisan bill is a very im-
portant step in generating awareness
at the Federal level of the need to
strengthen protections for our senior
investors.
Madam Speaker, protecting seniors
and ensuring the integrity of our cap-
ital markets are things that I believe
we all stand behind on this House floor.
It is our duty to protect our constitu-
ents, particularly the most vulnerable,
and that is why I urge my colleagues to
support H.R. 1876.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from
New Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER), the co-
author of this legislation.
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker,
I thank the gentleman for allowing me
to speak on behalf of this bipartisan
legislation. I also want to thank my
good friend, Congressman TREY HOL-
LINGSWORTH, for being a great partner
on this important legislation.
Since I took office, I have been com-
mitted to helping seniors save their
hard-earned money for retirement, to
helping them cut their taxes and afford
their prescription drugs, and to pro-
tecting Social Security and Medicare
so that, at the end of the day, they can
afford to stay in New Jersey and enjoy
their lives with their kids and their
grandkids.
Unfortunately, there are millions of
seniors across the country who have
been the victims of financial scams and
abuses that have cheated them out of
their rightful retirement and are now
putting that all at risk. Here are a few
disturbing facts.
According to a report from the Sen-
ate Special Committee on Aging, older
Americans lose approximately $3 bil-
lion each year to financial scams and
abuse.
Scammers claim to be a child or a
grandchild on the phone. Thousands
pose as IRS agents, others as tech sup-
port people and representatives; and
then, in the end, they are just going
after personal data and bank informa-
tion.
A separate survey from the Investor
Protection Trust found that approxi-
mately 7 million Americans have re-
ported being victims of exploitation.
They scare and intimidate seniors, and
many seniors don’t even report it. Only
1 in every 24 cases of elder exploitation
actually gets reported.
My mom was even a victim of one of
these scammers.
It is appalling. It is offensive. It is
unacceptable. Thankfully, we are here
today to do something about it.
Today, the House of Representatives
is considering our bipartisan legisla-
tion, the Senior Security Act, to help

protect vulnerable seniors from preda-
tory scams and financial abuse.
The bipartisan Senior Security Act
will help stop financial predators from
scamming seniors out of their savings
by finding ways to strengthen protec-
tions and safeguards for seniors and by
creating a senior investor task force at
the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion to focus on how seniors are being
targeted by fraudsters and to help stop
those who seek to take financial ad-
vantage of our seniors.
New Jersey’s seniors have given us so
much. We should always have their
backs and help protect them from
those who would seek to do them harm
and take advantage of them.
Madam Speaker, again, I would like
to thank my colleague, Mr. HOLLINGS-
WORTH, for his commitment to pro-
tecting seniors, and I urge my col-
leagues to support this commonsense,
bipartisan legislation.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, I appreciate the work of the
sponsor, Mr. GOTTHEIMER, and his im-
portant personal testimony about his
family and the importance of this bill.
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as
he may consume to the gentleman
from Indiana (Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH), the
minority sponsor of this bill and my
good friend.
Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. Madam
Speaker, I, too, rise in support of this
legislation.
This is not just a Main Street issue.
It is an Elm Street issue; it is a Maple
Street issue; it is a Broad Street issue.
This is an issue that affects our
friends; it affects our neighbors; it af-
fects our veterans; it affects our par-
ents and our grandparents. This is
something that has gone on far too
long.
We have all seen the startling statis-
tics. Over 24,000 cases were reported to
the Treasury Department last year
alone, more than double just 5 years
ago.
We have seen the statistics about
how over $3 billion a year are lost by
our senior citizens to scammers and
fraudsters.
We have all seen the statistics show-
ing how more than 10,000 baby boomers
are retiring each and every year, so
this problem will only grow into the fu-
ture.
I applaud Representative
GOTTHEIMER for reaching across the
aisle and working on how we stop this
problem, how we slow the growth of
this problem by setting up a task force
at the SEC to specifically focus on how
our senior citizens are being targeted,
how we can lessen their vulnerabilities.
This is an issue that I am extremely
passionate about, not only because of
the statistics that are startling and
eye-opening, but also because of the
Hoosiers who walk through our offices
every single day being the victims of
these crimes.
We had one a couple of weeks ago
who had already wired half of her life
savings as a part of a scheme to get a
Nigerian prince into the country. We
had somebody last year who had wired
over $8,000 because they believed that
their son had been imprisoned in Mex-
ico, wrongfully, and the money was
needed to get him out of prison.
They try all sorts of schemes. They
try all sorts of ruses. Well, it is time
that we come together and try to stop
them.
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the
work of Representative GOTTHEIMER
reaching across the aisle and devel-
oping legislation on how we find the
best practices to ensure that our senior
citizens, our veterans, our friends, our
neighbors, our parents, and our grand-
parents are protected in this very im-
portant time.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman
from Indiana’s comments. He has been
an excellent author.
Again, Madam Speaker, you hear the
testimony from both sides of the aisle,
from constituents in both these dis-
tricts, and the importance of this.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of my col-
leagues, we urge adoption of H.R. 1876,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of the time.
Madam Speaker, I want to congratu-
late, again, Mr. GOTTHEIMER and Mr.
HOLLINGSWORTH for having brought
this bill to the floor. I urge my col-
leagues to join us in supporting this
important piece of legislation to com-
prehensively examine and strengthen
the protections against financial ex-
ploitation of our senior citizens.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. FOS-

SUPPORTING THE PROTECTION OF
ELDERS THROUGH FINANCIAL
LITERACY
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I
move to suspend the rules and agree to
the resolution (H. Res. 328) supporting
the protection of elders through finan-
cial literacy.
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion.
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 328
Whereas in the context of the financial ex-
ploitation of the elderly, Federal statute de-
fines ‘‘exploitation’’ as ‘‘the fraudulent or
otherwise illegal, unauthorized, or improper
act or process of an individual, including a
caregiver or fiduciary, that uses the re-
sources of an elder for monetary or personal
benefit, profit, or gain, or that results in de-
priving an elder of rightful access to, or use
of, benefits, resources, belongings, or assets’’
(42 U.S.C. 1397j(8)) (‘‘Elder Financial Exploi-
tation’’);
Whereas the National Adult Protective
Services Association has stated, ‘‘Elder
abuse is vastly under-reported; only one in 44
cases of financial abuse is ever reported’’;
Whereas Elder Financial Exploitation is
expected to increase in the upcoming years
as 10,000 baby boomers are turning 65 each
day;
Whereas estimates by the Investor Protec-
tion Trust suggest that as many as one of
five citizens over the age of 65 are victims of
the theft of money, property, identity or be-
longings;
Whereas according to the National Center
on Aging, ‘‘Up to 5 million older Americans
are abused every year, and the annual loss by
victims of financial abuse is estimated to be
at least $36.5 billion.’’;
Whereas older adults are targeted for Elder
Financial Exploitation through schemes
such as fraud by trusted family, caregivers,
and fiduciaries, and through scams by
strangers often committed by international
criminal networks;
Whereas common schemes by fraudsters
and scammers include, lottery and sweep-
stakes scams, telemarketing scams, home-
repair scams, computer-repair scams, invest-
ment scams, internet phishing scams, abuse
of fiduciary authority, and identity theft;
Whereas Financial Literacy Month aims to
highlight for all Americans the importance
of establishing and maintaining healthy fi-
nancial habits;
Whereas education about healthy financial
habits includes the protection of one’s fi-
nances from financial exploitation, espe-
cially for older adults who are vulnerable to
targeted frauds and scams;
Whereas to combat this serious financial
concern and to protect the elder community,
this education must also extend to financial
institutions, law enforcement, and regu-
latory agencies so they may work together
to understand and detect these frauds and
scams;
Whereas these partnerships include not
only Federal agencies, but also State, local,
and Tribal authorities such as law enforce-
ment and adult protective services agencies;
Whereas the Financial Crimes Enforce-
ment Network (FinCEN) is vital to the pur-
suit of these bad actors, collecting suspicious
activity report (SAR) information and shar-
ing, as necessary, its data, analysis, and
guidance with appropriate public- and pri-
vate-sector partners focused on detecting
and ending Elder Financial Exploitation;
Whereas FinCEN, working with Federal
consumer and law enforcement partners en-
gages with financial institutions and State
and local authorities to educate on the signs
of Elder Financial Exploitation;
Whereas FinCEN, the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, and the Department of
Justice issued in 2017 a joint memorandum
to provide information on the use of SARs in
the investigation of Elder Financial Exploi-
tation, building on a 2011 Advisory that iden-
tified red flags for detection; and
Whereas despite the broad efforts by law
enforcement, regulatory agencies, financial
institutions, and private sector organiza-
tions to educate and share information,
Elder Financial Exploitation persists as a
multi-billion dollar industry, more can be
done: Now, therefore, be it

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days within which to
revise and extend their remarks on this
legislation and to insert extraneous
material thereon.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois?
There was no objection.
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to sup-
port H. Res. 328, a resolution intro-
duced by Congressman CASTEN of Illi-
nois and Congressman ROSE of Ten-
nessee.
This bipartisan resolution acknowl-
edges an important component of fi-
nancial literacy, and it is raising
awareness of threats to personal fi-
nances, especially for vulnerable tar-
geted populations such as older adults.
It also encourages continued public-
private partnerships and information
sharing to effectively prevent, detect,
report, and investigate elder financial
exploitation.
As we have heard, the baby boomer
generation is getting older; 10,000 of
them are turning 65 each day. Accord-
ing to the National Center on Aging,
up to 5 million older Americans are
abused every year, and the annual loss
by victims of financial abuse is esti-
mated to be at least $36.5 billion. That
is why we need to be proactive about
combating this serious problem on
multiple fronts.
We should work to arm our senior
citizens with the knowledge they need
to effectively detect and prevent finan-
cial exploitation by would-be crimi-
nals. Understanding the red flags and
warning signs to look for is important
first step.
In addition, we should continue to
support efforts by FinCEN and other
regulatory and law enforcement agen-
cies to ensure that information at the
disposal of these agencies is used to
better deter and respond to incidents of
elder financial exploitation.
Efforts like H. Res. 328, together with
the Senior Security Act of 2019 and the
Senior Safe Act of 2018, show Congress’
commitment to supporting our Na-
tion’s senior citizens on a bipartisan
basis. It also shows our commitment to
encouraging collaboration, public-pri-
vate partnerships, and information
sharing in order to effectively combat
financial exploitation of senior citi-
zens.
Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I
want to thank the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. CASTEN) and the gentleman
from Tennessee (Mr. JOHN W. ROSE) for
bringing this bipartisan initiative for-
ward, and I urge all Members to vote
‘‘yes.’’
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
H. Res. 328, Supporting the Protection
of Elders Through Financial Literacy.
This collaboration by Mr. CASTEN of Il-
linois and Mr. ROSE of Tennessee is,
again, an important bipartisan effort
to focus on financial literacy during
Financial Literacy Month as well as to
call attention to the challenges that
we have in making sure that our senior
Americans are taken care of and their
financial well-being.
According to research conducted by
the AARP Public Policy Institute, one
in five older Americans is a victim of
financial exploitation each year. These
victims lose up to $3 billion annually,
or more than $120,000 per victim, which
is more than most Americans have in
their entire retirement savings.
Sadly, only 1 in 44 cases is reported.
That is the challenge that we have
talked about here this afternoon, that
we make sure that that reporting is
identified so that restitution can be
made.
I am proud of the work the Congress
did on the Senior Safe Act, legislation
that originated in the Financial Serv-
ices Committee and was ultimately
signed into law last year. That legisla-
tion took an important step in offering
greater financial protection to seniors
by encouraging financial institutions,
investment advisers, and brokers to re-
port suspected fraud or elder abuse to
law enforcement—a good step.
This resolution we are now dis-
cussing also complements the fine
work of Mr. GOTTHEIMER and Mr. HOL-
LINGSWORTH for their work on the Sen-
ior Security Act.
Prevention is the best solution. More
can and should be done to educate sen-
iors and all Americans on healthy fi-
nancial habits and protection against
financial exploitation.
The unfortunate reality is that sen-
iors can be especially vulnerable to fi-
nancial fraud, as outlined by Mr.
GOTTHEIMER and Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH.
Even according to the SEC’s own re-
port in 2018, ‘‘Elder Financial Exploi-
tation,’’ it is attributed to cognitive
decline and wealth held by older gen-
erations.
We must work together to ensure
that bad actors don’t take advantage of
this population. These crimes range
from complex scams to the all-too-
common case of someone close to an el-
derly person tricking them into signing
away money that they had saved for
retirement. It is this last type of ex-
ploitation that is especially troubling.

As I referenced a few minutes ago,
people in a position of trust: lawyers,
CPAs, financial advisers.
H. Res. 328 highlights the importance
of educating the elderly about healthy
financial habits that include protecting
one’s finances from financial exploi-
tation. You can’t take it for granted
that we know better than to finance a
child’s entrapment in Mexico or that
you are going to help a Nigerian
prince. It sounds farfetched. But it hap-
pens every single day across this coun-
try, and education is the best form of
prevention.
I think we can all agree that the sta-
tus quo is not enough. H. Res. 328 raises
much-needed public awareness for the
importance of personal financial edu-
cation for the elderly and highlights
the collaboration between banks, law
enforcement, and financial advisers to
protect older generations.
For those reasons, I congratulate and
thank my friends, Representatives
CASTEN and ROSE, for their good work.
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as
he may consume to the gentleman
from Tennessee (Mr. JOHN W. ROSE),
the Republican author of this measure.
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.
Res. 328.
I applaud my colleague, Mr. CASTEN,
for his thoughtful leadership on this
initiative.
For too long, the financial exploi-
tation of our seniors has been swept
under the rug. It is truly heartbreaking
to hear stories of Tennesseans’ parents,
siblings, and friends being taken ad-
vantage of, often by those they trust
the most. It is time to equip our
friends, families, and neighbors with
the knowledge and tools they need to
guard against the heartbreak of their
hard-earned security and stability
being stolen in the golden years of life.
Age brings many of life’s most dif-
ficult challenges, but financial exploi-
tation should not be one of them. It is
incumbent upon us to correct this in-
justice and encourage the many com-
munity partnerships which work to do
the same, including the work of our

men and women in law enforcement,

affiliated regulatory agencies.
Scammers and deceivers hurt good
folks across the Sixth District of Ten-
nessee and across America.
My esteemed colleague from Illinois
(Mr. CASTEN) and I urge our fellow
Members to join us in standing against
this despicable injustice plaguing our
country.
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. CASTEN), the co-author of
this legislation.
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.
Res. 328.
I thank Representative ROSE for
working on this resolution with me in
a bipartisan manner, as well as Chair
WATERS and her staff for their commit-
ment to seniors and financial literacy.
H. Res. 328 supports the security of
seniors through the promotion of fi-
nancial literacy. This resolution sup-
ports the critical public-private part-
nerships that enable collaboration
among law enforcement, financial in-
stitutions, and regulatory agencies to
expand financial literacy and to detect
fraud and scams against seniors.
America’s seniors have worked hard
to raise families, pay their taxes, pro-
tect our country, and build our com-
munities. They have scraped and saved
to ensure their financial futures.
Ten thousand baby boomers are turn-
ing 65 every day and, by 2030, the num-
ber of Americans aged 65 and older will
more than double to 71 million, or
about 20 percent of the United States
population.
These older Americans, who have
given so much, are increasingly being
targeted for financial exploitation. And
in this digital age, with personal infor-
mation so easily procured, the scams
are only getting more complex and
harder to detect. We cannot stand by
and let our parents and grandparents
continue to be ripped off by increas-
ingly savvy con artists.
What would this resolution do?
It would support the goals of Finan-
cial Literacy Month to raise public
awareness about the importance of per-
sonal financial education in the United
States;
It would acknowledge that raising
awareness of threats to personal fi-
nances, especially for populations like
older adults and their relatives and
caregivers, is only one part of financial
literacy;
It would recognize that to combat
elder financial exploitation, it is also
necessary to encourage continued col-
laboration among law enforcement, fi-
nancial institutions, regulatory agen-
cies, and private sector organizations
to allow the detection, prevention, re-
porting, and investigation of those
crimes;
It would support work being done by
FinCEN, the Financial Crimes Enforce-
ment Network, and its partners to edu-
cate the stakeholders that serve and
protect America’s elder community;
It would urge continued public-pri-
vate partnership and appropriate infor-
mation sharing to prevent, detect, re-
port, and investigate elder financial ex-
ploitation; and
Finally, it would urge action to as-
sist with remediation and reporting, as
well as prevention and detection to
have the best possible data, feedback,
and incident response.
The path to economic security begins
with basic money management. But in
an increasingly complex financial land-
scape, we cannot limit our focus on fi-
nancial literacy only at the level of in-
dividuals and caregivers. We must also
include financial institutions, law en-
forcement, and regulatory agencies so
that they can work together to under-
stand and detect these frauds and
scams.
Financial exploitation can be dev-
astating. Studies have shown that sen-
iors who suffer from abuse, neglect, or
exploitation are three times more like-
ly to die than their counterparts.
Adding to this devastation—and this
is painful, but we have to admit it—is
the exploitation is often committed by
family members, by trusted friends, or
by caregivers. Financial abuse often
occurs with the implied acknowledge-
ment and/or consent of the elder person
and therefore can be much more dif-
ficult to detect or to prove.
Employees within the financial serv-
ices industry may often be the first to
detect those changes in the behaviors
of customers with whom they have reg-
ular contact. That frontline relation-
ship places institutions in a unique po-
sition to assist to protect customers,
upholding the inherent trust relation-
ship with their clients.
In acknowledging this role, FinCEN
issued an advisory to financial institu-
tions on filing suspicious activity re-
ports regarding elder financial exploi-
tation that would provide red flag indi-
cators and instructions on how to re-
port elder financial exploitation
through suspicious activity reports.
Timely reporting of suspicious elder
financial exploitation activity is crit-
ical to engaging entities that may have
complementary information on the vic-
tim or the perpetrator and may be well
positioned to collaborate or investiga-
tions.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H. Res. 328, sup-
porting efforts to combat elder finan-
cial exploitation.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of
my time.
Madam Speaker, in closing, this has
been a good afternoon on a bipartisan
basis to talk about the importance of
financial literacy. It is something we
all try to practice what we preach. We
try to encourage a broad sense of part-
nership between the regulators, our fi-
nancial services firms, the AARP, our
schools, and other people to enhance fi-
nancial literacy from adolescence to
elder years. And I think about what we
have heard today on what we are try-
ing to protect our constituents from
through education: internet scams, Ni-
gerian princes’ schemes, violators from
a trusted person.
And then I thought back, just sitting
here, Madam Speaker, of my own in-
laws, now deceased about 7 years—one
with Alzheimer’s and one just old-age
infirmities—and cleaning up all the
sweepstakes applications that they had
received and sent money to in those
final years of their life.
I thank my friends, led by Dr. FOS-
TER and others. I congratulate Rep-
resentative CASTEN and Representative
ROSE on this particular measure, H.
Res. 328. I urge all of my colleagues to
support it, and I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Madam Speaker, I want to again con-
gratulate Mr. CASTEN and Mr. ROSE for
having brought this resolution to the
floor. I urge my colleagues to join us in
supporting this important resolution
to empower senior citizens and pro-
mote public-private partnerships in
order to strengthen our enforcement
against crimes of financial exploi-
tation, and I yield back the balance of
my time.

Whereas in truth and fact, attorney
for Michael Cohen, Michael Monico, ad-
mitted in a March 12, 2019, letter that
Cohen’s testimony was inaccurate;
Whereas in truth and fact, the ex
post representation by Cohen’s attor-

Whereas in truth and fact, Cohen’s

Whereas in truth and fact, Cohen’s
denial of ever seeking a pardon con-

of his statement;
Whereas in truth and fact, Cohen’s
denial of ever seeking a pardon, as ut-

absolute and unequivocal;
Whereas in truth and fact, Cohen tes-
tified under oath that he and his law-

statement submitted to the Committee
on Oversight and Reform preceding his
testimony, which included the written
assertion, ‘‘I have never asked for, nor
would I accept, a pardon from Presi-
dent Trump’’;
Whereas in truth and fact, Cohen’s
denial in his written statement of
never asking for a Presidential pardon
was an unqualified assertion;
Whereas Michael Cohen falsely testi-

not want a role or title in the adminis-

Whereas in truth and fact the United

sire to work in the White House, ex-
plaining: ‘‘during and after the cam-
paign, Cohen privately told friends and
colleagues, including in seized text
messages, that he expected to be given
a prominent role and title in the new
administration. When that did not ma-
terialize, Cohen found a way to mone-
tize his relationship with and access to
the President’’;
Whereas Michael Cohen falsely testi-
fied under oath on other factual mat-
ters of material significance;
Whereas Michael Cohen’s inten-
tionally false testimony was aimed at
obscuring the truth and ameliorating
the extent of his own personal embar-
rassment;
Whereas intentionally false testi-
mony to a committee of the House of
Representatives harms the integrity of
the proceedings of the House;
Whereas it is a Federal crime to pro-
vide false information to Congress and
the failure to enforce this crime fur-
ther undermines the integrity of the

Whereas it is the judgment of the
House of Representatives that pro-

Resolved, that the House of Rep-

linois, as the Captain Robert L. Martin
Post Office.
Captain Robert L. Martin was a true
American hero dedicated to serving his
country to ensure the continued safety
of all Americans.
Robert L. Martin graduated from
Iowa State University, where he com-
pleted a civilian pilot training pro-
gram, and joined the Army Air Corps
in January 1944. Captain Martin was
one of the Tuskegee Airmen during
World War II, serving as a combat pilot
in the 100th Fighter Squadron of the
332nd Fighter Group.
During his 64th mission, he was shot
down over German-occupied territory
and safely evaded capture for 5 weeks
to return across Allied lines. He left
the Army in 1945 with the rank of cap-
tain.
His war decorations include the Dis-
tinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal
with 6 oak leaf clusters, and the Purple
Heart. Martin was also awarded the
Congressional Medal in 2007 by Presi-
dent George W. Bush at a ceremony
honoring the Tuskegee Airmen.
Having lived in Olympia Fields, Illi-
nois, it would be a tribute to his life’s
accomplishments to name the post of-
fice there as the Captain Robert L.
Martin Post Office, bringing a source of
pride to the community in honoring a
great American hero.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

myself such time as I may consume.
I rise today to support H.R. 1449,
sponsored by Representative KELLY.
H.R. 1449 names a post office in Olym-
pia Fields, Illinois, in honor of Captain
Robert L. Martin.
During World War II, Martin joined
the Army Air Force and trained at the
airfield in Tuskegee, Alabama.
As a member of the famous Tuskegee
Airmen, Captain Martin flew over 63
missions. He was attached to the 100th
Fighter Squadron, providing air sup-
port for Allied bombing runs into Cen-
tral Europe.
Captain Martin was decorated with a
Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air
Medal with oak leaf clusters, and the
Purple Heart. In 2007, President Bush
awarded Captain Martin the Congres-
sional Medal of Honor for his bravery
in World War II.

at 25 Route 111 in Smithtown, New
York, as the Congressman Bill Carney
Post Office.
Representative Bill Carney was a
man truly committed to public service.
Before serving as a distinguished Mem-
ber of this body, Bill not only served
the people of Suffolk in their legisla-
ture, but also the United States of
America as a member of the Army
Medical Corps.
Bill Carney was born in Brooklyn,
New York, and went on to serve the
United States Army Medical Corps
after graduating from high school.
After leaving the military, Bill began
serving in the Suffolk County legisla-
ture before being elected to serve the
people of New York’s First Congres-
sional District in 1978.
Representative Carney is remem-
bered not only for his contributions to
this body, but also for the lighthearted
personality, humor, and humility that
he brought with him each day he
served.
Sadly, Bill Carney died in May of
2017, and he is sorely missed. Naming a
post office in Bill’s honor in Suffolk
County is the least we should do to
honor the great career and life of Bill
Carney.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-

Mr. GIBBS. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-

Congressman LEE ZELDIN.
H.R. 828 names a postal facility in
Smithtown, New York, in honor of the
man who represented the First District
of New York four decades ago, former
Congressman Bill Carney.
Congressman Carney was elected in
1978 to represent Long Island. He
served as a Member of this body for
four terms, until 1987.
Before coming to Congress, Mr. Car-
ney served in the United States Army
Medical Corps. From there, he went on
to serve his local government as a
member of the Suffolk County legisla-
ture. Congressman Carney is remem-
bered as a lighthearted man of the peo-
ple.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.

Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I reserve the balance my
time.
Mr. GIBBS. Madam Speaker, I yield 5
minutes to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. ZELDIN), my friend.
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, today
I rise in strong support of H.R. 828, my
legislation to honor the life and legacy
of former Congressman William Carney
by renaming the post office in
Smithtown, New York, in his honor.
Congressman Carney was a beloved
husband, father, and grandfather, but
for our community, for New York’s
First Congressional District, for our
Nation, and for the ideals in which he
believed, he was a fighter until the
very end.
Even before his life in politics, his
commitment to serving his country
and community never wavered. After
attending Florida State University,
Congressman Carney joined the United
States Army Medical Corps, where he
served from 1961 to 1964.
After leaving the Army and working
in the private sector, Congressman
Carney was elected to the Suffolk
County legislature for 3 years before
being elected to the United States
House of Representatives to represent
the First Congressional District of New
York from 1979 to 1987.
He was the first registered Conserv-
ative Party member to ever be elected
to Congress. He was a relentless fighter
for his constituents and the ideals in
which he believed, and he had a long
list of accomplishments to show for it.
Legislation he introduced and ush-
ered into law designated areas of the
Fire Island Seashore as wilderness, en-
suring its conservation and protection
for generations to come. To this day,
Fire Island remains one of Long Is-
land’s most iconic landmarks thanks,
in part, to his legislation.
Always so very proud of America’s
servicemembers and having served in
the Army himself, Representative Car-
ney was a proud cosponsor of the Ko-
rean War Memorial Act, as well as the
resolution to recognize the vital role
played by members of the National
Guard and Reserves in the defense of
our Nation.
Mr. Carney will be remembered for
his strength, integrity, and commit-
ment to his district and Nation. There
is no place he loved more than Long Is-
land, no people he more admired, and
there is no doubt there is no place he
would rather have his legacy enshrined
than in the community that he called
home.
Nearly 2 years ago, Congressman Car-
ney lost his final battle. He was suf-
fering from prostate cancer.
He is survived by his wife and child-
hood sweetheart, Barbara Haverlin; his
two daughters, Jackie and Julie; and
his four grandchildren. Thank you to
each and every one of them for allow-
ing their husband, father, and grand-
father to dedicate his life to serving
our community.
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to support this legislation.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE
CLERK OF THE HOUSE
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Clerk of the House of
Representatives:
OFFICE OF THE CLERK,
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Washington, DC, April 30, 2019.
Hon. NANCY PELOSI,
The Speaker, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to the
permission granted in Clause 2(h) of Rule II
of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, the Clerk received the following mes-
sage from the Secretary of the Senate on
April 30, 2019, at 11:13 a.m.:
That the Senate agreed to Relative to the
death of the Honorable Richard G. Lugar,

Sincerely,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3323
April 30, 2019
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 962,
BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SUR-
VIVORS PROTECTION ACT
Mr. HAGEDORN. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged
from further consideration of H.R. 962,
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act, legislation to block
fourth-trimester abortions, and ask for
its immediate consideration in the
House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been
cleared by the bipartisan floor and
committee leaderships.
Mr. HAGEDORN. Madam Speaker,
for the protection of life, I urge that
the Speaker immediately schedule this
important bill.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is not recognized for debate.
f
ACT TO PROTECT THE UIGHUR
COMMUNITY
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
for constituents with whom I recently
met whose family is one among mil-
lions of Uighurs, the ethnic Muslim
community from Xinjiang in northwest
China being persecuted by the Chinese
Government.
My constituents’ parents are among
the estimated 1 million Uighurs and
other Muslims who are currently being
held in camps because of their faith
and ethnicity. The reports of what is
happening to this community—mass
targeting, detention, and torture based
on faith and origin—echo the darkest
chapters in human history.
I am heartened to see that there is
bipartisan support for doing something
about it. That is why I say to leader-
ship: Move the bipartisan UIGHUR Act
and the Uyghur Human Rights Policy
Act through committee and to the
floor so that we can pass these bills in
the House, push the Senate to take
them up, and get them signed into law.
Only by acting in moments like this
can we truly live up to the pledge
‘‘never again.’’ Let’s stand together
and say no to ethnic cleansing on our
watch.

TITLE X GAG RULE PUTS LIVES
AT RISK
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in opposition to the Trump ad-
ministration’s Title X gag rule. The
gag rule is a Federal prohibition on
funding for healthcare providers who
may refer patients to an abortion.
The Title X gag rule will endanger
patients who rely on health clinics
that will lose Federal funding. That
means women will have less access to
cancer screening, reproductive health
services, birth control, and health edu-
cation.
By prohibiting medical caregivers
from making decisions in the best in-
terest of patients, the gag rule puts
lives at risk. All patients, regardless of
geography, income, race, or identity,
should be able to access whatever med-
ical care and health information their
healthcare provider thinks is relevant.
The Trump administration should
not be deciding what a doctor or a
nurse or any healthcare giver tells
their patients.
f
UNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, we
have gone through some very difficult
times, and I want to call the roll: Tree
of Life, Robert Gregory Bowers; Moth-
er Emanuel Church, Dylann Roof;
Christchurch, Brenton Harrison
Tarrant; just recently, in San Diego,
John Earnest; and recently arrested,
Mark Steven Domingo.
First of all, I want to thank the FBI
and its investigation for stopping Mark
Steven Domingo.
I challenge all of us, as colleagues, to
begin the debate and discussion on
hate, White nationalism, and Nazism,
for it is not something that we can
allow to seed and grow. We can’t allow
someone who wants to attack a White
nationalist group that is meeting be-
cause of hatred, nor can we allow some-
one to gun people down in their syna-
gogues or mosques or churches.
America is better than this, and we
as Members of Congress need to begin
to discuss race, discrimination, Na-
zism, White nationalism, sexism. We
need to discuss it in a way that is even
more than legislation.
So I call upon the Nation, I call upon
this President to stand up and an-
nounce to America that enough is
enough and that he stands for the
unity of all of us.
f
ADDRESSING HUMANITARIAN
CRISIS IN VENEZUELA
(Mrs. MURPHY asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mrs. MURPHY. Mr. Speaker, there is
a humanitarian crisis in Venezuela and
it is man-made.
My view is simple. The people of Ven-
ezuela will not prosper as long as the
Maduro regime remains in power. It
has proven itself to be cruel, incom-
petent, and antidemocratic.
Ideally, the regime will go peace-
fully, but it must go.
The United States cannot be passive.
We must stand behind the proud Ven-
ezuelan patriots who have taken to the
streets and are struggling to reclaim
their country from the regime that is
destroying it. We must be ready to sup-
port these brave men and women with
all elements of American power, al-
ways working alongside our partners in
Latin America.
The Venezuelan people need to know
that we have their backs. If the
Maduro regime targets its own citizens
with violence, it should be prepared to
suffer the consequences.
To the Maduro regime, I say
‘‘enough,’’ ‘‘basta.’’ To the people of
Venezuela, I say ‘‘be strong,’’ ‘‘fuerza’’;
‘‘we are with you,’’ ‘‘estamos con
ustedes.’’
f
SUPPORTING EFFORTS OF NOAA
CORPS
(Mr. CASE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, today, with
my colleagues Mr. YOUNG of Alaska
and Mr. HUFFMAN of California, I am
proud to introduce the National Oce-
anic and Atmospheric Administration
Commissioned Officer Corps Amend-
ments Act of 2019.
The women and men of the NOAA
Corps proudly and professionally oper-
ate NOAA’s highly specialized fleet of
research and survey ships and aircraft,
including the famed Hurricane Hunter
aviators. Several of those ships are
based in my State of Hawaii and con-
duct surveys used to manage our fish-
eries and protected species and study
and map the ocean floor.
Like the other uniformed services,
the NOAA Corps officers spend most of
their careers away from home at sea,
in the air, and in remote locations such
as Antarctica conducting this impor-
tant work but are often overlooked in
the legislative and administrative
process, resulting in a patchwork of
statutory authorities, benefits, and ob-
ligations of service.
Our bill will help the NOAA Corps
improve recruitment, retention, and di-
versity to attract the best and the
brightest commissioned officers and
better align this great Corps with the
other uniformed services as they con-
tinue their great service to NOAA and
to our Nation.
I look forward to working with my
colleagues to pass this bill and support
the efforts of the NOAA Corps.

fundamentally flawed Paris Agree-
ment.
In 2015, more than 170 countries
signed a nonbinding agreement at the
United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change in Paris. While
most countries set a target reduction
of carbon emissions below its 2005 level,
the Obama administration sought to
dramatically reduce the United States’
carbon emissions by between 26 and 28
percent below its 2005 level by 2025.
Before I proceed any further, I yield
to my good friend, the gentleman from
Arizona (Mr. BIGGS). He is a tireless ad-
vocate for small businesses in his dis-
trict, many of whom have been harmed
by this type of legislation.
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr.
GOSAR, and I appreciate his leading the
Western Caucus Special Order hour of
the day and all that he does, and the
members of the Western Caucus, on
these issues.
President Obama attempted to im-
plement the Paris Agreement domesti-
cally through an executive order he
issued in September 2016, but the Paris
Agreement was never ratified by the
United States Senate as is constitu-
tionally required for a treaty to exist
and, therefore, is not a legally binding
treaty.
In June 2017, President Trump an-
nounced that the U.S. would cease all
participation in the 2015 Paris Agree-
ment, which is fully in its power to de-
cide because, again, U.S. involvement
is not legally binding. I applauded that
decision then; I continue to applaud it
now, and this is one of the reasons why.
This Paris accord has little efficacy.
It will not save the world. Even if we
take at face value the assumption that
climate change poses an existential
threat to the planet, U.S. compliance
with the Paris Agreement, or even a
full embrace of a far more expansive
Green New Deal, would do little to
avert that result.
The U.S. is no longer the primary
source of global CO2 emissions. In fact,
between 2005 and 2017, our Nation has
reduced CO2 emissions by 862 million
tons, and market forces are increas-
ingly pushing us toward using cleaner
and more efficient fuels.
Meanwhile, during roughly the same
period, China increased its emissions
by 4 billion tons and India by 1.3 billion
tons. It is extremely unlikely that ei-
ther China or India are going to fulfill
their requirements within the Paris
Agreement.
But even if they and every other
country in the world, including the
U.S., were to comply, we would still
only succeed in reducing global tem-
peratures by less than one-half of 1 de-
gree Celsius by the year 2100. That is
according to the National Center for
Atmospheric Research.
Like the Green New Deal, H.R. 9 is
nothing more than cynical partisan
messaging. I urge everyone in this
Chamber to vote ‘‘no.’’
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Representative BIGGS for his com-
ments.
H.R. 9 seeks to mandate implementa-
tions of those same technically implau-
sible and unrealistic emissions goals in
order to appease extremists. The bill
also seeks to prevent Federal funds
from being used to withdraw from the
flawed Paris Agreement.
Americans for Tax Reform estimates
the Paris Agreement will cost the U.S.
an estimated 6.5 million jobs by 2040
and reduce our gross domestic product
by over $2.5 trillion.
NERA Consulting estimates those
numbers are even higher and that the
Paris Agreement will cost the U.S. an
estimated 31.6 million jobs by 2040 and
reduce our GDP by over $3 trillion.
In June of 2017, President Trump an-
nounced he will withdraw the United
States from the Paris Agreement, stat-
ing: ‘‘The Paris climate accord is sim-
ply the latest example of Washington
entering into an agreement that dis-
advantages the United States to the
exclusive benefit of other countries,
leaving the American workers and tax-
payers to absorb the costs in terms of
lost jobs, lower wages, shuttering fac-
tories, and vastly diminishing eco-
nomic production.’’
There are other significant flaws of
the Paris Agreement. MIT found the
Paris Agreement will only result in a
global temperature reduction of 0.2 de-
grees Celsius by 2100. Under the Paris
climate agreement, China and India
will actually increase emissions until
at least 2030.
The Climate Action Tracker, a group
of European research organizations,
found that participating parties will
not meet their commitments, and
those are the goals of the Paris Agree-
ment.
The European Climate Action Net-
work reported that no single country
in Europe is performing sufficiently to
meet Paris Agreement goals, and those
that have been making the most
progress on their promises did not
make large commitments in the first
place.
A recent United Nations Emissions
Gap report found all participating
countries will have to at least triple
their efforts in order to meet the Paris
Agreement’s basic goals.
Given how unrealistic and illogical
the Paris Agreement is, the U.S. should
not inflict monumental harm on our
economy chasing a white unicorn.
Fortunately, there is an alternative.
Members of the Western Caucus sup-
port personal responsibility, less gov-
ernment intervention in our daily
lives, and freedom. They defend prop-
erty rights and believe that private
ownership of property is a fundamental
right in America. Our vision encour-
ages innovation and less burdensome
mandates.
Members of the caucus support local
control and believe that stewardship of
our environment and natural resources
is best accomplished by empowering
local stakeholders, not victimizing
them.
The people who depend on the land to
provide security for their families and
communities understand these re-
sources best. States and municipalities
are best suited to deal with local issues
than the distant, out-of-touch Wash-
ington bureaucrats.
The caucus seeks to promote access
to our Nation’s energy and resource po-
tential while pursuing a truly all-of-
the-above energy approach that aims
to ensure the U.S. is a global energy
leader.
Our vision utilizes the current energy
renaissance and the American energy
dominant policies currently being im-
plemented by the Trump administra-
tion. America’s energy renaissance is
the backbone of our economy; it is a
story of freedom, prosperity, and op-
portunity.
After decades of reliance on other
countries to meet our energy needs,
the U.S. Energy Information Adminis-
tration projects that America will ex-
port more energy than it imports start-
ing in 2020. We are no longer dependent
on volatile foreign sources produced in
Russia and Saudi Arabia.
Recent innovations and technology
improvements associated with hydrau-
lic fracturing and horizontal drilling
have allowed shale resources pre-
viously deemed uneconomical to be de-
veloped and the main reason the U.S.
was the world’s leader in carbon emis-
sions reductions in 2015, 2016, and 2017.
That is right. Fracking, demonized
by environmental extremists without
justification, has proven to be the best
energy solution for our environment.
Abundant oil and natural gas have
reduced electricity bills, kept gas
prices low, and provided the largest
share of U.S. electric power generation
in recent years.
The United States is the world’s top
energy producer, and the American
Dream is thriving. Passing H.R. 9 and
staying in the Paris Agreement threat-
ens that dream.
This is not a partisan issue. This is
about doing what is right for America
and about protecting freedom and op-
portunity for our children and grand-
children. I urge all Members on both
sides of the aisle to reject H.R. 9.
Now, with that, I yield to my friend
from Utah (Mr. BISHOP). As the Repub-
lican leader on the Natural Resources
Committee and previously as its chair-
man, he has been one of the biggest
leaders in promoting American energy
dominance.

April 30, 2019
b 1430
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
thank Mr. GOSAR for yielding me time.
I appreciate this opportunity.
Mr. Speaker, look, I was listening to
a lecture the other day about the old
Romans, the Roman Empire. The Ro-
mans’ success in creating their empire
was that they were incredibly creative
and adaptive. They saw situations that
needed to be changed, something new,
and they did it.
They had perfected the phalanx ap-
proach. They learned from the Greeks
how to fight. Yet when they came
against the Samnites who were living
in the hills, that phalanx approach was
totally useless. So what the Romans
did is created a way around that, an-
other source, to have a very flexible,
highly mobile type of attack force,
which they called the Legions. They
simply became adaptive to the new sit-
uation.
This is where I wish the other side of
this body would try to become less dog-
matic and more adaptive, to try to find
solutions.
Instead of bringing another resolu-
tion to the floor that has no chance of
passing in the Senate and would be ve-
toed by the President, we should spend
our time trying to come up with cre-
ative solutions that would be a win-
win-win situation. We can do it. We
need to.
It would be nice if the other side of
the aisle could also understand what
Article I actually means. In the last
administration, instead of taking this
accord through the normal constitu-
tional process of having it ratified in
the Senate and doing it by executive
fiat, they have to realize what can be
done by executive fiat instead of the
constitutional way can be undone by
executive fiat.
Rather than now trying to go back to
the old document that has questionable
efficacy, let us try to move forward.
This is happening all over the place.
The State of California has a lot of
talk about green talk, yet they have
increased their dependence on foreign
oil in the last year by 57 percent. That
is foreign oil.
We have to do things in a way dif-
ferent than simply talking about it. We
had a bunch of hearings in our com-
mittee about climate change. We heard
from the Hip Hop Caucus. We even
heard from people who thought NFL
concussions were a problem and needed
to be solved somehow through climate
change. I don’t know how that fit, but
it was an interesting day.
Let me try to talk to you instead
about something that is in the purview
of our government, that can be done
and that can be a creative and adaptive
solution to this problem of too much
carbon in the environment: simply,
carbon sequestration.
I would refer you to a guy, a doctor
by the name of Williams, who took
1,000 acres of land in Mississippi that
had been farmed for 150 years, most of
that in cotton. Instead, he turned it
into rangeland, grazing rangeland.
He had had no herbicides, no pes-
ticides, no seeding, no artificial fer-
tilizer. The only management tech-
nique he used was intensive grazing fol-
lowed by periods of rest so that the
soil, the plant life, could recover. That
is the only thing he did.
They tell me that the results after 4
years was simply an increase in the
number of foraged species that were
there, an increase in the number of na-
tive species that were reappearing, and
an increase in the general biodiversity
of insects and wildlife and everything
else.
He told me, in technical talk that I
don’t understand, that for every 0.6
percent increase in soil C per acre in 1
foot of soil, whatever that means, you
can take 35 metric tons of CO2 out of
the atmosphere. That means nothing
to me.
What this guy in Mississippi was able
to do is come up with a 2.3 percent in-
crease in that soil carbon, I am assum-
ing, which would equate to 140,000 met-
ric tons of CO2 taken out of the atmos-
phere. Those numbers also mean noth-
ing to me; I don’t know what it means.
What I do understand is that what he
was able to do was the equivalent of
taking out emissions from 7,600 auto-
mobiles every year and sequestering it
into his 1,000 acres of ground. That is
the equivalent of burning 13,000 tons of
coal that he was able to take out of the
atmosphere and sequester it into the
ground.
Mississippi alone has 10 million acres
of land that is farmland of all types. If
you were able to use all of that, Mis-
sissippi alone could take out of the at-
mosphere 7 percent of all the emissions
that we have and sequester it into
their ground in that State simply by
itself, which means, if you extend that
out mathematically to 150 million
acres, the United States could be a net
negative emitter. We could be taking
more carbon out of the atmosphere and
putting it into the ground than we are
sending into the atmosphere.
Approximately 5.1, I am told,
gigatons of CO2 emissions are auto-
matically sequestered into the oceans
and our terrestrial sinks. If you under-
stand what that means, you are a bet-
ter man than I am. That is what I have
been told. That means, to become net
zero, we would only have to have 75
million acres of land being used for
carbon sequestration, 75.
In the United States, we have 527
million acres of pasture and rangeland.
Twenty-seven percent of the land that
we have is in pasture and rangeland.
We have 410 million acres, which is 21
percent of all land, in forestry.
Simply by having an aggressive way
of grazing, improving grazing and im-
proving the quality of our forests, we
can suck carbon out of the atmosphere,
which would be far easier and far bet-
ter than anything in the questionable
efficacy of the Paris accord.
You could do it with no cost. You
wouldn’t have to cost jobs or energy in-
creases. You can do it with virtually no
cost except for the initial cost of buy-
ing the livestock to put on the land,
which is why it is there.
We could have the benefits of a better
watershed, better wildlife, better bio-
diversity, and economic productivity of
our rural lands. All those things are
easily within our reach.
We could help solve the food short-
age. We could help solve drought resist-
ance in agricultural lands. We could
have watershed integrity, which would
provide abundant and cleaner water for
us all, as well as biodiversity for wild-
life.
I was recently in Arkansas, if I can
go on with this. The State forestlands,
they had 2 pieces that they were work-
ing on. One they just let go on so they
could see what would happen, let na-
ture run its course. The other they
went through with active management
by thinning the trees.
What happened in the one that they
just left alone? It was crowded. It was
dark. There was no sunlight getting to
the ground, which was barren of all
kinds of foliage.
On the portion that the State man-
aged, where they allowed the sunlight
to get to the ground, there was vegeta-
tion. There was forage. There was the
ability to have food. Wildlife had a
habitat they could use.
That has also been replicated in my
home State, where on private property,
some of my sheep ranchers did the
exact same thing. They improved the
ground.
Not only have they improved the
ground, but they can also now suck
more carbon out of the atmosphere
into that ground, which you don’t do if
you just leave it alone.
We had a hearing in our committee
one time, and they simply said the idea
was that plants need carbon, so you
have plant life sucking the carbon out
of the atmosphere. It goes down into
the root system, which makes the
plant healthier, the land healthier, and
you are taking carbon out of the at-
mosphere. That is a wonderful idea.
We had four witnesses. Even the
Democratic witnesses were saying that
grazing helps us to accomplish this.
One of our good Eastern members
said: Well, look, if plant life sucks the
carbon out of the atmosphere, why
don’t we take the cows out, and then
you will have more plant life. They
won’t eat any of it.
Even the Democratic witness said,
no, that is not the way it works.
If you allow the plant just to grow, it
grows large and sprouts out and hides
the ground so that you don’t have any
kind of new plant life coming on. You
take the cows out, and their hooves
don’t claw up the land as they walk
around, so nothing is germinating. All
you have is a bunch of dry, dead leaves
that are easy bait for wildfires. What
you have to do is allow them to eat and
then move them off the land.
Can we destroy the land with bad
grazing practices? Of course. But if you
do it the right way, we can easily solve
the problems.

H3326 April 30, 2019
We have two kinds of problems with
carbon: one is emissions and the other
is concentration, stuff already out
there.
If we just do grazing practices and
carbon sequestration on the lands that
the Federal Government owns now, we
can easily not only solve our problem
of emissions but take the concentra-
tion out and put it back into the
ground, where it does good for plant
life and expands and grows that.
We have here the resources that we
need to solve this problem. What we
need to do is free up people to be able
to solve this problem by themselves
and not insist that the government tell
us what to do, when to do it, and how
to do it. It doesn’t work that way. This
can be a win-win situation.
H.R. 9, I am sorry, does not have any-
body winning. It has all of us losing.
That is why it would be nice to see that
there are solutions out there.
All we need to do is be like the old
Romans and be a little bit creative and
adaptive, find something that works
with material we already have. We can
do that. There is a better way to go
forward than H.R. 9.
H.R. 9 is simply more dogma to try to
rehash the past. It doesn’t move us for-
ward at all.
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. GOSAR
for having this Special Order here so
we can talk about these kinds of issues
as well as the costs that would be in-
volved.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, to the
Member, to the gentleman, we are also
getting another benefit because the
catastrophic wildfires that we are see-
ing out West are a contributor. There
is more carbon and pollution that oc-
curs during these catastrophic
wildfires in one day than in a year of
exhaust from cars.
What we do is we get a benefit there
because we have a much more dynamic
forest, much more dynamic interfaces.
The fires are smaller. They are not as
catastrophic, so we don’t go further in
debt.
This is something that the Natural
Resources Committee has been pushing
under Mr. BISHOP’s watch, and I thank
the gentleman. There is plenty of ben-
efit in regard to understanding the nat-
ural cycle of plants and trees.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker,
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.
GOSAR) is spot-on accurate. I thank
him for bringing this up.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I also want
to bring up the point that the Western
Caucus was dynamic in going to Hous-
ton to see Petra Nova in Texas. It is
the only carbon sequestration coal
plant in the United States, one of only
two in the world.
Basically, what they do is they cap-
ture the carbon sequestration and pres-
surize it into pipes. They pipe it down
to their oil fields. Once they frack the
oil fields, they take this pressurized
carbon and force it into the oil field.
What it does is it forces out the rest of
the gas and oil with it that is still re-
maining and then solidifies in the
ground.
What amazing technology. Once
again, going back to the whole applica-
tion that technology, innovation, the
private sector is right there to answer
the call.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from California (Mr. LAMALFA). Mr.
LAMALFA knows firsthand the negative
effects that policies like H.R. 9 can
have, given the proposals that have
gone into effect in California.
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank
my colleague from Arizona, Mr. GOSAR,
for hosting this Special Order on this
important topic and for his very good
work on the Congressional Western
Caucus.
As we know, this week, the House
will vote on H.R. 9, the Climate Action
Now Act. In light of the United States’
incredible efforts and achievements in
becoming more energy independent and
a global leader in energy development
and production, we should call it the
U.S. Energy Disadvantage Act.
This shortsighted legislation would
seek to prevent President Trump from
withdrawing from the misguided 2016
Paris Agreement enacted by President
Obama. Of course, this agreement was
passed without consent from Congress
and no economic impact or cost-benefit
analysis.
The American people deserve to
know what a plan like this is going to
cost them. According to several re-
ports, the Paris Agreement could cost
the U.S. $250 billion and 2.7 million jobs
by just 2025 and many more jobs over a
longer period, and even as much as $3
trillion by 2040.
Furthermore, this bill is completely
one-sided. It received no congressional
hearings or feedback from the adminis-
tration, stakeholders, or outside ex-
perts.
Bottom line, this bill would result in
an unfair economic playing field
against the United States and in favor
of all the other countries.
We have already seen the results of
this agreement in the city of Paris
itself, where protests have erupted over
their own gas price increases.
Just like the Green New Deal boon-
doggle, enacting this legislation would
have an almost insignificant effect on
decreasing global emissions. Indeed,
the United States is already by far the
leader in reducing greenhouse gas
emissions and has lowered our levels of
emissions by 18 percent between 2000
and 2014, leading other major countries
and producers.
Why do we need to be in the Paris ac-
cord when we are already leading the
way? We need to drag the others along
in this process and have them do more
about their own emissions, such as
China, which emits more carbon diox-
ide than the U.S. and the European
Union combined.
Why are they let off the hook in this
until the year 2030? Why is India let off
the hook until 2030? I guess American
consumers and the higher prices they
are paying at the pump, especially
Californians at over $4, would like to
know the answer to that question.
It is another attack by the left to un-
dermine the responsible production of
energy in America. We don’t need to be
in the accord to achieve these reduc-
tions, as we have already seen these re-
sults.
If forced to stay in the Paris climate
agreement, the U.S. economy will suf-
fer while achieving no meaningful ben-
efits or reduction in global emissions.
This is like many climate change
schemes that are focused on transfer-
ring power via taxation and regulation
to the government away from the pro-
ducers of this country.
b 1445
Are we going to have the power in
the hands of elected officials and bu-
reaucrats or the people that innovate
better ways of doing things, better
forms of energy, and more efficient
forms of energy, and have them pro-
duced right here in the U.S., including
California, which is a leading producer
of energy?
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to reject this measure and any
other climate change scheme that
hurts our economy and our energy pro-
duction when we are the innovators of
doing things better around the world.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield to
the gentleman from Idaho (Mr.
FULCHER). With his background in the
technology industry, he knows first-
hand how businesses in his district and
across the country are already inno-
vating and helping to reduce our car-
bon emissions.
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, I am
pleased to join the members of the
Western Caucus for this important Spe-
cial Order.
Let me start by saying that my home
State of Idaho has been a good example
of how to utilize renewable energy re-
sources.
According to the Energy Information
Administration, in 2017, 82 percent of
Idaho’s net electricity generation came
from renewable energy sources, and 60
percent was supplied by hydroelectric
power.
Idaho’s use of renewable energy tech-
nology came about because we are
blessed with bountiful natural re-
sources in our State. But, Mr. Speaker,
not every State is blessed with those
renewable natural resources and many
have to rely on nonrenewable sources
of energy.
However, because the Federal Gov-
ernment controls 63 percent of the land
in Idaho, many of those resources are
not accessible and, all too often, lit-
erally go up in smoke.
Sole Federal control of resources in-
hibits economic growth, harms the en-
vironment, and has created numerous
obstacles for our citizens due to inad-
equate management.
H.R. 9 and the Paris Agreement rep-
resent a similar obstacle to every State
and every district my colleagues rep-
resent.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3327
April 30, 2019
H.R. 9 would reinstate the one-size-
fits-all mandates of the Paris Agree-
ment and require the U.S. to dras-
tically change the only ways that we
generate electricity.
What has enabled the United States
to lead the world in reducing carbon
emissions is locally-driven solutions
that fit the need of our local citizens,
whether it be clean, liquid natural gas
in Texas, hydropower in Idaho, or solar
facilities in Arizona.
The Paris Agreement is an attack on
our national sovereignty and received
no congressional input when it was en-
acted in 2015. In fact, we are one of
only 12 countries that signed the agree-
ment that did not include their legisla-
tive branch in that adoption process.
Mr. Speaker, even China’s legislature
was consulted in the adoption of the
agreement.
The flawed Paris Agreement has
committed the United States to get-
ting billions of dollars to the Green Cli-
mate Fund while many countries don’t
contribute at all. All too often, that
money ends up in the hands of govern-
ments who have no intention of using
it to reduce their carbon emissions.
This agreement forces jobs to relo-
cate to areas with the poorest environ-
mental records, like China, which only
makes matters worse. Instead of focus-
ing on spending money paying for
projects to reduce carbon emissions in
other countries, the Democrat major-
ity in this House should focus on the
immediate pressures facing this coun-
try, like border security and
healthcare reform.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
reject this terrible proposal.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank my
friend from Idaho for those remarks.
You can see where this is going. The
right way is not this Paris accord, but
through technology and through inno-
vation.
Mr. Speaker, a point that has been
brought up multiple times by my col-
leagues is how the Paris Agreement is
a direct violation of our Nation’s sov-
ereignty. I could not agree more. Arti-
cle II, section 2 of the Constitution
states that the President ‘‘shall have
power, by and with the advice and con-
sent of the Senate, to make treaties,
provided two-thirds of the Senators
present concur.’’
President Obama took unilateral ac-
tion when he signed the Paris Agree-
ment back in 2015 and failed to consult
Congress. There were no committee
hearings leading up to the adoption of
the agreement and no vote was held by
the Senate, as mandated by our Con-
stitution.
Members on the other side will say
that the Paris Agreement does not con-
stitute a treaty. But when the Foreign
Affairs Committee held a hearing on
this very bill, every witness believed
the agreement was a treaty. This in-
cluded multiple Democratic witnesses.
The practice of avoiding congres-
sional approval was nothing new for
the Obama administration when it
came to natural resources and energy
policy.
Fortunately, Members will have a
chance to correct this unconstitutional
action by voting for my amendment
that was made in order this week in-
structing the Senate to take a vote as
to whether the Paris Agreement is a
treaty or not.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to enter
into a colloquy with the gentleman
from Virginia (Mr. GRIFFITH), my good
friend. He has some background on this
information.
Mr. GRIFFITH. Part of what hap-
pened was that they danced through a
lot of different hoops to try to make
sure that they didn’t have to have it be
a treaty. If they could at least make
the argument that it was not a treaty,
because they knew they couldn’t get
Senate confirmation.
And, in fact, the Democrat champion,
Senator Pell, who was the chairman at
the time of the appropriate committee,
actually put in their committee report
that should there later be a con-
ference—and they were talking about
the original conference that we had en-
tered into, the United Nations Frame-
work Convention on Climate Change,
which this is not an extension of—
many people say it is, but they had to
adopt all new rules and all new aspects,
because they knew they couldn’t just
add this on to the original one.
But Senator Pell says, ‘‘The com-
mittee notes that a decision by the
conference of the parties’’—referencing
the U.N. commission—‘‘to adopt tar-
gets and timetables would have to be
submitted to the Senate for its advice
and consent before the United States
could deposit its instruments of ratifi-
cation for such an agreement.’’
Now, the Paris accord, the Paris
treaty, ostensibly says that there are
targets and timetables. But even the
Democrats recognized in 1992 that if
you were to put in targets and time-
tables, you had to have that document
submitted to the Senate for its advice
and consent. So, a decision by the con-
ference to adopt targets and timetables
would have to be submitted to the Sen-
ate for its advice and consent before
the United States could deposit its in-
struments of ratification for such an
agreement.
Clearly, they anticipated that some-
day there might be timetables and tar-
gets and they wanted to make sure
that everybody knew that in 1992, just
because we joined that conference, did
not mean that we had agreed to later
being bound to timetables and targets.
Now, we are doing very well on those
timetables and targets without having
announced we are leaving. And even if
we are not a member of the Paris ac-
cord, agreement, treaty, whatever you
end up calling it, we are doing very
well at reducing our carbon footprint.
The Chinese are producing about
twice as much carbon dioxide as we are
today. They have the number two econ-
omy and we have the number one econ-
omy per job, and from a production
standpoint we are doing a lot better.
They are not even bound until 2030
under this so-called treaty agreement.
But it is very clear that in order to
bind us to anything, it had to be ap-
proved by the Senate and it has not
been approved by the Senate.
So, what we are arguing about, in es-
sence, is merely a political point for
the people on the other side of the
aisle, because these targets, as they
currently exist without ratification
from the Senate, are merely sugges-
tions. We are doing what we can in a
reasonable way. We need to do more on
research so that we can continue to
have the jobs and have the wealth and
be the number one economic nation
and continue to reduce our carbon foot-
print.
Now, I’ve got to tell you, I get a lit-
tle amazed sometimes at some of these
folks, because the World Bank decided
they weren’t going to invest in any
more coal-fired power plants—now I
know I am going off subject, but let me
run. The World Bank decided they
weren’t going to invest in any more
coal-fired power plants. The top ten do-
nors to the World Bank include nine
western countries and Japan. So, basi-
cally, the west and Japan decided that
they were not going to invest in those
things. So guess who is investing? You
can guess.
Mr. GOSAR. Russia.
Mr. GRIFFITH. It is China. And Rus-
sia is probably doing some, too. But
China is heavily out there. And they
are getting a two-for because the devel-
oping world, particularly sub-Saharan
Africa, want to have power and energy
for their people, because they want
their people to not live in the dark and
have electricity. They want their peo-
ple to have jobs. They know that in
order to have better jobs, they have got
to have electricity in their country
across the board, not just in the big
cities. They have got to have a source
of power, and they have coal. For
them, that is their most affordable
source.
So what the Chinese are doing, they
are basically laughing at us. We are
going to agree to these timetables that
haven’t been ratified by the Senate and
these targets, while they get to con-
tinue increasing. Even though they are
the number two economy in the world,
they are going to continue to increase
their carbon footprint, and they are
going to build coal-fired power plants
in sub-Saharan Africa for which they
get a lot of goodwill in the foreign af-
fairs and foreign relations department.
But wait, there is more.
In many of these cases—I can’t say
all, but the ones I have read about—
they are, for a fee, going to run those
coal-fired power plants for the nations
that they are building them in. So not
only are they going to build goodwill
and good relations around the world
using coal in contravention of these
goals set forth in the Paris accord, but
they are going to make a profit at it,
as well.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3328 April 30, 2019
Mr. GOSAR. Absolutely. The one
road initiative. They are taking and
leveraging resources across the world
and, at the same time, being paid for
it. And I dare you not keep up with
your payments because it rescinds
right back to them.
Going back to your first point, the
gentleman from Virginia, what you are
telling me is that this body will have
that opportunity, with my amendment,
to get this right, instructing the Sen-
ate to take a vote on the Paris accord
to actually see if it can become a trea-
ty, would you agree?
Mr. GRIFFITH. Well, your amend-
ment would certainly do that, and I
will support that amendment. While I
can’t support the underlying bill, I can
support that amendment because that
does make the underlying bill better. If
we are going to bind our hands and seal
our fate to be the number two or num-
ber three or number five economy in
the world, instead of being the number
one economy in the world, if that is
what we are going to do, then there
ought to be votes taken down the hall.
Men and women in the United States
Senate should put their name on the
line and say yes or no. The American
people then will know who has voted
yes and who has voted no. They won’t
be hiding behind any games or cir-
cumstances or procedural maneuvers.
Then the American people can use the
power that was given to them by our
Constitution and an inalienable right
granted by God to use the ballot box to
make a decision as to whether or not
they wanted to be bound, whether or
not they wanted to have their economy
reduced, and have their children and
grandchildren to be lesser than what
we have today in our economic wealth.
Mr. GOSAR. So, what you are really
telling me is when you have good proc-
ess, you build good policy, which builds
good politics. It is kind of that simple,
isn’t it?
Mr. GRIFFITH. It is that simple. You
shouldn’t hide behind games or trick-
ery to say, well, this is not really a
treaty that has to go to the Senate be-
cause the targets are merely aspira-
tional. If they are merely aspirational,
why are we spending billions of dollars
on it and why are we participating at
all, which I think was the President’s
point.
Why would we spend billions of dol-
lars to send to countries, some of
whom might actually be kleptocracies,
and the money is never getting to
where it is supposed to go? Why would
we spend billions of dollars on some-
thing that we know is not going to be
effective? Let’s spend our billions of
dollars on research and find new tech-
nologies.
You may have heard me tell the
story, because it has been my favorite
story the last couple of weeks, but I
have a professor at Virginia Tech who
has been working on technology to sep-
arate coal from rare Earth minerals.
But there is a side effect. It also can
make poor coal better coal. And they
are selling that technology.
Now they are licensing a company in
India for two steel mills—steel, for
those who don’t speak southwest Vir-
ginian, steel mills—and they are li-
censing them to use this technology, so
they can take Indian coal and make it
better and then reduce their carbon
footprint and still produce the steel.
The Indians aren’t going to say they
are not going to use the coal and we
are not going to produce steel. They
want what everybody wants. They
want a better economy. They want
jobs. They want those people in their
country—and I understand there are
hundreds of millions—who don’t have
electricity to have electricity in their
homes.
Like everybody else, they want clean
air and clean water, too. But it is not
going to happen by an edict of the
Paris accord. It is going to happen by
research that makes sense and that
economically says you can have the
steel to build new factories, to build
new cities, to build new things in your
country to make your country better,
wherever you are: sub-Saharan Africa,
Asia, Europe, America, South America,
North America, wherever you are. But
you can do it better and you can do it
cleaner and you can do it where it is
cost effective. That is what we have to
focus on, not arbitrary, capricious
goals set with different countries hav-
ing different standards. As an Amer-
ican, as U.S. citizens, we have a higher
target, and there is no target for the
Chinese.
b 1500
Mr. GOSAR. The gentleman brings
up that when we look at coal, the sepa-
ration of rare earths, that is the tech-
nology that is so important. This is the
technology that is driving this renais-
sance of technology in our country,
that plethora of energy where we can
geopolitically decide to help other
countries become more independent,
away from China’s and from Russia’s
jurisdiction.
The entrepreneurial spirit is bred
with having energy independence. This
H.R. 9 kills jobs.
I also want to bring up to the gen-
tleman, with technology, there is an-
other technology at the same time that
takes up pulverized coal and infuses it
into oil. When they burn it, they get a
50 percent additional Btu factor and a
cleaner burning application, once again
reducing the carbon footprint.
Once again, talking about new tech-
nologies is what saves us. It is that en-
trepreneurial spirit making things bet-
ter. The infusion of new technology
helps us get an advancement of cleaner
technology.
Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, what is
exciting for the American people, what
is exciting for me, I would say to the
gentleman, is that we have just men-
tioned a couple of areas where tech-
nology is working, making things bet-
ter, and reducing our carbon footprint.
In our universities and our think tanks
across the country, there are hundreds
and thousands of ideas percolating out
there that can help us move forward.
You may not agree with me on this,
but I think we can spend more money
from the Federal Government on re-
search to find better ways to use fossil
fuels. Wave energy, wind, solar, what-
ever it is, we need to be leading on the
research end of this.
If we think we are going to eliminate
fossil fuels, Mr. Speaker, we are mis-
taken, because the world is going to
continue to use fossil fuels. If you say
to a developing economy that they
have to rely on wind, they are going to
know that you are full of hot wind.
Mr. GOSAR. That is right.
Mr. GRIFFITH. If you say to them,
however, that we are going to try to do
all of the above, so we are going to help
you burn the coal you have; we are
going to help you find the fuels that
work for you, but we want to try to
help you do it in a cleaner fashion; and
we want to make that coal a little bit
better, to make that oil a little bit bet-
ter, to make it burn hotter, to make it
burn more efficiently, that is how you
lower your carbon footprint.
I like what the gentleman from Utah
had to talk about in grazing on our
Federal lands. If we started using dif-
ferent techniques, we can absorb a lot
of carbon. We should probably spend
some research money to find out if
those crops and those plants that can
be utilized to suck up more carbon can
maybe produce other products as well.
These are things that we need to do,
instead of saying we are not going to
use any of this in the future because we
might do that to the detriment of our
jobs here in the United States. We are
going to shift those jobs to other coun-
tries where they will use dirtier coal,
dirtier oil, dirtier techniques for burn-
ing fossil fuels to produce the products
that we then buy back, making them
the richer nations in the world and we
the lesser.
When I am on my deathbed, I want to
be able to look my kids in the eye—
hopefully, I will have grandkids some
day—and say: You know what? We kept
the United States of America number
one in the economic situation, and we
looked out for the planet at the same
time.
It can be done, but it can’t be done if
all you say is, no, we are not going to
look at fossil fuels.
Mr. GOSAR. The gentleman brings
up a great point, along with the former
chairman of the Natural Resources
Committee, not only in the grazing ap-
plication but in the stewardship of our
natural resources called our forests,
dynamic forests. Instead of being vic-
tims of these catastrophic wildfires
that put so much of the emissions and
pollution into the air, we then relegate
it, so when we do have fires, it is rel-
egated to low-level type fires that are
not as devastating and catastrophic.
I want to bring up one other point.

administration unconstitutionally uti-
lized to shift $1 billion in taxpayer
funds without authorization from Con-
gress. Once again, we were imposed
upon by having the money, Uncle Sam
Warbucks.
The Green Climate Fund was a goal
of raising $100 billion a year through
voluntary contributions from countries
that signed the Paris Agreement. While
developed countries are expected to fi-
nance their respective agreements
under the Paris Agreement, the Green
Climate Fund aims to subsidize the
agreements of developing countries
that cannot afford the commitments
they made when signing the Paris
Agreement.
In fact, since the United States rati-
fied the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change in 1992,
the United States has given hundreds
of millions of dollars to developing
countries to help them mitigate cli-
mate change. Amazing.
We know that much of the money we
have given over the years has gone to
some of the most corrupt countries in
the world. My question is, how can we
rely on these countries to spend the
money properly? When you look, for
example, in 2014, the top recipients for
climate funds all received failing
grades in Transparency International’s
Corruption Perceptions Index. Amaz-
ing.
What has been the return on invest-
ment for the money that we were giv-
ing to these countries? It is nice to be
able to fund this, but what are the re-
sults? What are we getting from that?
Mr. GRIFFITH. If the gentleman
would tell me.
Mr. GOSAR. The facts are that car-
bon emissions from the developing
countries have gone up. We know that
much of the money was not used to re-
duce carbon emissions.
Once again, we are not solving it.
It is clear that H.R. 9, that is what it
will do. It will put the country back on
the road to job losses, higher electric
bills, and more government regulations
while wasting significant amounts of
taxpayer money in the process.
We become victims in this economy.
We should be leading the way. Freedom
comes with technology and oppor-
tunity, and that is what the American
people want.
This is something where we should
show the way by leadership, by saying:
Listen, follow us by the way that we do
things.
That seems like a better approach,
doesn’t it, to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia?
Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, it abso-
lutely is a better approach. It really
does bother me that we are just hand-
ing cash over to these countries.
As you said, they don’t have trans-
parency. Some of them are known to
have corrupt governments, which
means that at least a portion of that
money is probably ending up in the
pockets of the rulers’ friends, neigh-
bors, and cousins.
If we are going to spend the money,
let’s go in and spend the money on
something that will make a difference
for the folks in those countries.
I am not saying as the richest nation
in the world that we don’t have a re-
sponsibility, but let’s make sure that
we don’t cripple ourselves in the proc-
ess. Let’s make sure that if we are
going to spend the money, which I am
okay with spending some of it, that we
make sure it is going to projects that
will improve the environment in those
countries and help lower the carbon
footprint in those respective nations.
They are not going to sit back and
have their people be impoverished just
because a group of Western nations got
together or a group of nations got to-
gether that already have some money
and said: You stop using fossil fuels so
that the world won’t get warmer.
They may be concerned about that,
and I think they probably are, but they
are not going to impoverish their peo-
ple to target 1.5 degrees centigrade.
If we can show them a way to get
more wealth for their people, to bring
electricity to all regions of their coun-
tries, and to lower their carbon foot-
print, they are all in. That is where we
can lead.
We don’t have to spend money by
just handing cash to potentates around
the world. We can spend that money on
research right here in our own colleges,
in our own universities, in our own
think tanks with people. Some of them
will fail, but some of them will come
up with new technology. Like when
looking for a way to separate rare
earth from coal and they figure out a
way to lower the carbon footprint at
steel mills in India, those kinds of
things happen when you are looking for
answers to problems instead of looking
for problems.
Mr. GOSAR. Right, the carrot versus
the whip. What you are looking at is
the opportunity for solutions, that
incentivization to find a new oppor-
tunity. I think that is the value. We
are protecting 6.5 million jobs here.
It scraps the unconstitutional appli-
cation of the treaty, and it ensures
safe, reliable, affordable energy.
Everybody has to have energy. When
we start looking at this Paris accord,
it is accomplished in so many different
ways that H.R. 9 is not something that
is a valid or constitutional agreement.
Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I agree
with the gentleman.
Mr. GOSAR. Having said that, the
Paris Agreement may have been their
most egregious breach of constitu-
tional authority. Many Members on
the other side have stated in the past
that President Trump does not have
the authority to unilaterally withdraw
the United States without the consent
of Congress.
By virtue of the executive’s role as
the sole organ of the government
charged with making official commu-
nications with foreign states, it is re-
sponsible for communicating the
United States’ intention to withdraw
from international agreements and po-
litical commitments.
In the case of this executive agree-
ment, President Obama had inde-
pendent authority to enter into an ex-
ecutive agreement. President Trump
may also independently terminate the
agreement without congressional ap-
proval.
In addition to there being no congres-
sional input on the agreement, there
was no congressional input when draft-
ing the agreement. This is not the way
an agreement as wide-reaching as the
Paris Agreement should have been
agreed upon.
Passage of H.R. 9 will bring us back
to the foreign policy of President
Obama and the practice of putting
other countries’ interests above our
own. This is the same foreign policy
that brought us Benghazi, the rise of
ISIS, and the disastrous Iran nuclear
agreement.
President Trump’s promise to with-
draw the United States from the Paris
Agreement marked a dramatic change
in America’s foreign policy—for the
better, I might add. The Paris Agree-
ment fails to put America first, and
President Trump is right to withdraw
us from this sovereignty-sacrificing
agreement.
Mr. Speaker, the facts are becoming
clearer about the realities and failures
of the Paris climate agreement.
First of all, let’s talk about the good
news. The United States reduced its
carbon emissions by 40 million metric
tons in 2017. Yes, our emissions did rise
slightly in 2018 due to increased domes-
tic manufacturing, but the U.S. Energy
Information Administration projects
that our carbon emissions will con-
tinue to fall in 2019 and 2020.
Now for some bad news. The United
States’ reductions in carbon emissions
are totally erased when you account
for China’s dramatic increase in carbon
emissions. Several speakers have
talked about that. In fact, China’s in-
crease in emissions is three times larg-
er than the U.S.’s decrease in emis-
sions.
Mr. Speaker, this highlights two of
the fundamental failures in the frame-
work of the Paris Agreement, which is
the fact that there are no mechanisms
in place to hold countries accountable
for not reaching their emissions reduc-
tion targets, and there are no require-
ments or required countries to estab-
lish equitable emissions reductions
over the same period.
It is not just China, either. India, for
example, saw its emissions rise 4.8 per-
cent in 2017. Forty-seven of the 50 most
polluted cities in the world are located
in either China or in India.
Well, you may say, let’s look to Eu-
rope. They are probably on the fore-
front of following the standards set
forth in the agreement.
People would think that, but that
would be wrong, as all EU countries are
off-target in reaching the goals set
forth by the Paris Agreement. Ger-
many, for example, has spent almost

$600 billion in renewable energy sub-
sidies and has seen no meaningful de-
crease in carbon emissions.
Mr. Speaker, the United States was
already a leader in reducing carbon
emissions before the Paris Agreement
was signed. Since 1970, the United
States has reduced six key air pollut-
ants by 73 percent and has seen the
largest absolute reduction of CO2 of
any country in the world since 2000.
Instead of focusing on bringing us
back to the past, we should focus on
encouraging innovations that we are
already seeing in the energy sector
today. Whether it be carbon capture
technology, clean coal, or taking ad-
vantage of the liquid natural gas revo-
lution that is taking place across the
country, the private sector is leading
the way in creating a cleaner energy
future for this country.
That is the way it should be, not
through a heavy-handed government
imposing unrealistic, top-down man-
dates.
Requiring the U.S. to follow the re-
quirements of the Paris Agreement will
stifle innovations and return us to the
policies of the past when energy was
more expensive and economic growth
was abysmal.
It appears that I am running out of
time, so what I will do is implore my
folks to, first, relook at this.
I thank all the Western Caucus mem-
bers who contributed to the Special
Order. It is truly a privilege to be chair
of the caucus, which is now 74 bipar-
tisan members strong.
Mr. Speaker, we will continue to lead
the fight against the extreme agenda,
which is why we organized the Special
Order in opposition to H.R. 9.
b 1515
Mr. Speaker, I will close with a quote
from the National Federation of Inde-
pendent Business, who oppose this leg-
islation.
Under this legislation,
Small businesses would face significant fu-
ture government mandates, additional regu-
latory and legal burdens, and unworkable
government policies that would result in
skyrocketing energy prices.
At a time when the small business econ-
omy is booming with small business owners
reporting record hiring of new employees and
historically strong compensation increases
for their employees, Congress should be con-
sidering policies that will allow this eco-
nomic boom to continue, not bring it to a
halt.
I hope this legislation is voted down
by the House this week and we get seri-
ous as a Congress about promoting en-
ergy dominance for the betterment of
our economy, energy consumers, the
environment, and geopolitically across
the world.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
f
PARIS ACCORDS WERE FLAWED
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.
GRAVES) for 30 minutes.
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr.
Speaker, years ago, the administra-
tion, working through an international
group, had helped to negotiate and put
together an agreement on climate
change known as the Kyoto Protocol.
That protocol was resoundingly re-
jected by the United States Senate.
It actually had provisions in it that
indicated that should the United
States in the future end up entering
into some sort of climate agreement or
any type of agreement, that there
would have to be some type of a con-
sent by the United States Senate; that
this would have to be presented before
the United States Senate.
We don’t have a unilateral govern-
ment. We don’t have a dictatorship. We
have scenario whereby we have a Con-
gress, we have a President, and we
work together. In this case what has
happened is, under the Obama adminis-
tration, these Paris accords were
agreed to unilaterally, meaning they
were never submitted to the Congress.
They were never submitted to the
United States Senate for approval.
Mr. Speaker, that is why the Amer-
ican people have their Representatives.
Their Representative is their Senator,
and that is how their voice is heard on
agreements like this.
Yet, we had a President that unilat-
erally agreed to the Paris accords and
did not submit it to the United States
Senate. So now we have a President
that is saying: Well, this was unilater-
ally agreed to. I am unilaterally with-
drawing.
We have a bill this week, H.R. 9, that
attempts to prevent the President from
withdrawing from this. So I want to
stick with procedure here for just a
minute, Mr. Speaker.
We unilaterally entered into an
agreement that we don’t believe should
have been entered into unilaterally. We
think it should have been presented to
the United States Senate. It was not.
Now the President is saying, I am
withdrawing. And now this bill is try-
ing to prevent that. So, on the one
hand they think that a President
should be able to unilaterally act, and
in another scenario, the withdrawal
that President Trump has proposed,
you have folks saying with H.R. 9 that,
no, no, you can’t do that. You can’t
have both. One or the other, take your
pick.
Now, let’s actually get into the con-
tents of the agreement. The Paris ac-
cords set targets on emissions reduc-
tions for the United States. All right,
so they try and set emissions reduc-
tions.
Mr. Speaker, under this agreement,
we could eliminate all emissions from
the United States, all greenhouse
gases. We can eliminate all of them,
and China can come in and they can
emit 10 times what we were emitting
before we cut. Under this agreement
that is totally legal. It doesn’t make
sense.
To add insult to injury, China can go
years and years increasing emissions;
not reducing, increasing. I want to re-
mind you, we live in a global environ-
ment. As much as we like to think we
are the only country in the world, we
are not. It is a global environment. If
you care about the whole environment
for the entire globe, you have got to
look holistically.
You can’t come to the United States
and say: Okay, you have to cut emis-
sions. Yet, in China, they can double,
triple, they can go tenfold increasing
their emissions, twentyfold increasing
their emissions, and that is all legal
under this agreement. That is inappro-
priate. If we care about the global envi-
ronment, let’s care about the global en-
vironment.
Now, to add insult to injury, the
agreement also establishes an entirely
different metric for developing coun-
tries like China than it does for the
United States.
Now, think about this, if we are in
the Olympics; we are running a race,
and you win the race. But then some-
body comes, and they say: No, no we
are giving this Chinese runner a 20-sec-
ond deduction. That is not fair. And
that is what has happened here.
They have an entirely different met-
ric that they are measured by. Why? If
we live in a global environment, if we
care about overall reducing emissions,
why are we giving different standards,
different measurements? That is inap-
propriate. This entire agreement is
flawed.
Now, some of you may be sitting
there thinking: Well, wait a minute. I
care about the environment. I care
about emissions reduction.
Let me read you a statement that
was included in the International En-
ergy Agency’s Global Energy & CO2
Status Report.
Here is the statement: ‘‘Emissions in
the United States remain around their
1990 levels, 14 percent and 800 metric
tons of CO2 below their peak in 2000.’’
Now, here is the kicker. Listen to
this statement. ‘‘This is the largest ab-
solute decline among all countries
since 2000.’’
I am going to say that again. ‘‘This is
the largest absolute decline among all
countries since 2000.’’
Let me translate that, Mr. Speaker.
What that means is that the United
States, over the last, nearly 20 years,
has reduced emissions greater than
every other country.
So, we are actually operating with-
out a requirement, just with an incen-
tive. We are operating on already re-
ducing emissions. We are already
transitioning to an all-of-the-above en-
ergy strategy which includes solar,
which includes wind, which includes
geothermal, which includes hydro, and
nuclear, and natural gas, and coal, and
oil, and other things, all of the above,
whichever makes the most sense.
We had a hearing today in the Select
Committee on the Climate Crisis and it
was fascinating listening to people

talking about the impact of these en-
ergy policies on the poor.
Well, Mr. Speaker, the home State
where I am from, south Louisiana, we
have the lowest electricity rates in the
United States, the lowest. The States
that have the highest are the ones that
are forcing things that are perverting
or distorting markets. Those are the
States that have the highest elec-
tricity rates. That disproportionately
affects the poor.
We were citing today an analysis by
the Manhattan Institute. In that anal-
ysis, they looked at if you invested $1
million and you could invest it in
solar, you could invest it in wind, or
you could invest it in natural gas and
shale—I see my friend here from North
Dakota that represents much of the
shale production in the United States—
you would get a sixfold increase in the
amount of energy produced by invest-
ing it in shale.
I remind you, Mr. Speaker,
transitioning to natural gas results in
a significant reduction in emissions as
compared to other sources. It is part of
our existing infrastructure. It is part of
a transition plan. And not to say that
we don’t ever transition or continue
migrating to renewable sources; it is
all of the above.
Don’t say all of the above, as Presi-
dent Obama and others did, but then
carry out policies that prevent you or
drive up the cost of these other energy
sources. It doesn’t make sense and that
is what disproportionately affects the
poor.
Mr. Speaker, we have other Members
here from the Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis, and I appreciate them
being here. I am looking forward to en-
gaging with them on bringing reality,
bringing practicality to this discussion
today.
But I want to say in summary: num-
ber one, procedurally, the Paris ac-
cords were flawed. Practically speak-
ing, the targets that were established
disproportionately affect the United
States, and it establishes a different
measuring stick, a different standard
for us than it does for China and other
countries.
I remind you, Mr. Speaker, China,
the country that is here under the aus-
pices of a developing Nation, this is the
country that is spending billions and
billions of dollars around the world on
projects in other countries to improve
their national security, their defense,
contrary, in many cases, to the United
States and our allies. This is a devel-
oping country. This is inappropriate.
And I will say one last thing in clos-
ing. We are the country that over near-
ly the last 20 years has had the great-
est reduction in emissions and we have
done it by incentivizing, not by coming
in and distorting markets and putting
perverse policies in place.
H.R. 9 is a flawed approach that is
going to have a disproportionate im-
pact on the poor. It is going to simply
squeeze a balloon in the middle and
make it pop out on the sides where you
have more emissions resulting in China
and other countries. Because compa-
nies will leave the United States, jobs
will leave the United States if we ad-
dress this inappropriately, and they
will go to other countries where they
will be less energy efficient. They will
release greater emissions into our glob-
al environment. That is not a win.
Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of H.R.
9. I urge support of involving the
United States Senate, the United
States Congress in these discussions
and negotiations, and to develop a true
all-of-the-above energy strategy that
incorporates things like incentives,
thinks about our infrastructure net-
work and other important components
of ultimately achieving this objective,
which we all share, which is giving a
better planet to future generations.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Georgia, Congressman BUDDY
CARTER, that, similar to me, represents
a coastal district.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding,
and I thank him for hosting this today.
This is extremely important.
Mr. Speaker, I have the honor and
privilege of representing the First Con-
gressional District of Georgia, a dis-
trict that includes the entire coast of
Georgia, over 100 miles of pristine
coastline. We are very proud.
The coast of Georgia is my home.
That is where I have lived all of my
life, where I was born, and I was raised,
and where I intend to live the rest of
my life. I love the coast of Georgia, and
I have always said that I am going to
protect the coast of Georgia, and I am.
Mr. Speaker, climate change is real.
Protecting our environment is real. We
understand that. Since day one, the cli-
mate has been changing. Yes, indus-
trialization has had an impact on it as
well. We understand that.
In order to represent my constitu-
ents, I believe our Nation needs to be
working in a responsible way, a respon-
sible way to prepare ourselves for fu-
ture weather events while striving for
cleaner and more affordable energy
sources.
Mr. Speaker, in an 11-month period,
we had two major hurricanes on the
Georgia coast: Hurricane Matthew and
Hurricane Irma. The number of hurri-
canes appears to be increasing and
there are those who would argue that
the intensity of those hurricanes are
increasing. That is something we are
concerned with.
Mr. Speaker, I serve on the Select
Committee on the Climate Crisis, as
well as on the Environment Sub-
committee of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, and that is very im-
portant. That is where I need to be as
the Representative of the coast of
Georgia. I need to be on those commit-
tees. This is where I want to be.
Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, to ad-
dress this problem, the majority party,
the Democrats, have offered H.R. 9. It
is coming to the floor this week and it
is not a solution. It is not a solution to
climate change.
What it is, is government overreach
at its best. It disallows the President
from withdrawing from the Paris cli-
mate agreement. It puts our economy,
our national security, and our ability
to make our environment cleaner in
danger, while other nations, as was
pointed out by my colleague from Lou-
isiana, other nations just simply con-
tinue on. They aren’t held by these
same principles.
b 1530
China right now is responsible for 30
percent of the pollution in the world,
and yet they aren’t abiding by this.
They aren’t even a part of the Paris
climate agreement. They are not even
participating in this until 2030.
As my colleague pointed out, again,
they can just continue to increase pol-
lution while here in America, if the
President is not allowed to get us out
of this climate agreement, we are
going to have to adhere to that. That is
not fair, and it is not going to help if
China is not held to the same prin-
ciples that we are held to.
Mr. Speaker, between the year 2000
and 2014, the United States decreased
emissions by more than 14 percent, in
fact, by more than 18 percent, but Chi-
na’s emissions have increased. They
have doubled since the year 2000, and
they are significantly higher than the
U.S. right now.
The U.S. is already leading the way
without the Paris climate agreement.
We are leading the way. We are the
economic leader, and we can’t let a
half-baked policy like H.R. 9 jeopardize
that status.
Companies in our country are respon-
sible, and they are leading the way. As
my colleague from Louisiana men-
tioned, we had a meeting earlier today
of the House Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis. We had witnesses who
told us about companies that are in-
volved in this that already, on their
own accord and on their own initiative,
are doing things and putting in place
programs that are going to help with
climate change.
For example, there is a startup called
4Oceanis that has collected 4.2 million
pounds of ocean garbage. If we put our
economy at risk through expensive reg-
ulations and mandates, then we risk
losing companies like this and the cap-
ital that they have necessary to invest
in these projects.
As my colleagues stated earlier, we
have to have an all-of-the-above ap-
proach. In order to control climate
change, we need three things: We need
adaptation; we need mitigation; and we
need innovation.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 9 is bad policy.
Again, as my colleague pointed out
earlier, it was brought about without
even a subcommittee hearing. It was
rushed through. This is a very impor-
tant subject. This is a very important
subject that can’t be rushed. We can’t
take this lightly. We have to take this
seriously. We are taking it seriously in
the Republican Party.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3332 April 30, 2019
The Democrats didn’t think about
the real consequences of this bill. Here
we have the Green New Deal, pie in the
sky that would ruin our economy by
$93 trillion, and it includes things such
as healthcare for all. Now, what has
that got to do with climate change?
Absolutely nothing.
We need to concentrate; we need to
focus; and we need to have real, com-
monsense solutions to this. That is
what we are proposing. But here we
have politics as usual on Capitol Hill
with Democrats bringing this to the
floor. They couldn’t care less about the
impact on our economy or the impacts
on real people.
This legislation, H.R. 9, quite frank-
ly, would be better off being called the
‘‘U.S. Energy Disadvantage Act.’’ That
is what they ought to call it.
Having said all this, Mr. Speaker, I
will tell you—and I mean this sin-
cerely—I am excited. I am excited
about the future of clean energy. I am
excited about the future of innovation
in America. We have the greatest
innovators in the world right here in
America. We have the smartest sci-
entists in the world right here in
America. If we simply give them the
chance to do their work, then they will
do it. I am convinced of that.
Yes, we need to incentivize it and we
need to encourage it, but we don’t need
to be an obstacle, and we don’t need to
be in the way.
Look at the internet, arguably one of
the greatest inventions in modern
times. Where did that come from?
Right here in America.
I am excited. I am convinced that we
can come up with real solutions to
this. Unfortunately, H.R. 9 is not one of
those real solutions. H.R. 9 is going to
ruin our economy.
The Green New Deal, are you kidding
me? That kind of pie-in-the-sky type of
legislation has no place. We need real
solutions. Citizens sent us up here to
come up with real solutions, not some
pie-in-the-sky idea.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
vote against H.R. 9 and deliberate on
real solutions that will make our world
cleaner and improve our environment
without destroying our economy.
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr.
Speaker, I want to thank the gen-
tleman from Georgia for his comments.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from North Dakota (Mr. ARMSTRONG),
who is another member of the House
Select Committee on the Climate Cri-
sis.
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker,
Americans care about clean air; Ameri-
cans care about clean water; and the
U.S. needs to be at the table for these
discussions as we move into a global
economy. But, Mr. Speaker, a bad deal
is worse than no deal at all. Make no
mistake, H.R. 9 is a bad deal.
Almost no countries are in compli-
ance with the Paris deal now, let alone
its future requirements. I am going to
have some breaking news here: China is
not a developing country. China emits
over 30 percent of the world’s pollution.
But not China, not India, not Aus-
tralia, not the EU, and not even Can-
ada are in compliance with the current
terms.
The U.N. Emissions Gap Report esti-
mates U.N. countries will have to tri-
ple their efforts to meet the Paris deal
commitments. This deal imposes
stricter requirements on the United
States than other countries. It requires
significant and economically damaging
carbon emission reductions from the
United States without requiring those
same requirements from China, from
India, and from other developing coun-
tries.
A true international agreement to
address carbon emissions would require
actionable commitments from all the
countries and would have included a
mechanism for enforcement. China has
only committed to raising its nonfossil
fuel share of its economy to 20 percent
by 2030 and a commitment that CO2
emissions will peak in 2030. That is not
including their financing of essentially
unregulated coal plants all over the de-
veloping world.
U.S. CO2 emissions have peaked in
the mid-2000s and have decreased since
then. The United States is on track to
hit about 65 percent of the voluntary
targets based on both the Bush- and
Obama-era regulations and existing
power sector trends.
Mr. Speaker, we need to focus on de-
veloping and exporting innovation and
technology to reduce emissions; give us
cleaner air and water and reliable, af-
fordable energy for families all across
the country. Without that, this bill is
simply virtue signaling. But it is worse
than that because, by its very nature,
it will force the exporting of pollution
to countries that do not have the
United States’ regulatory controls.
We benefit from producing energy
here. It is done safely and securely and
creates American jobs. We need to end
our reliance on foreign fuels and pro-
mote homegrown and home-produced
fuels just like we have done in North
Dakota.
The energy sector not only is great
for our economy, but it is incredibly
important for national security. So
let’s get on with real solutions. Let’s
get more pipelines in the ground. Let’s
allow for natural gas to be burned dur-
ing the winter instead of heating oil.
Let’s end sue-and-settle
environmentalism, and let’s not forget
that we had 8 years under the Obama
administration to lead environ-
mentally by symbolism and symbolism
alone. We need to get rid of symbolism
and start working toward action.
Democrats are offering unrealistic,
counterproductive policies like stop-
ping pipelines needed to transport envi-
ronmentally safe natural gas and stop-
ping trains from going into their own
States. We need to allow for our energy
infrastructure to catch up to where it
needs to be, and then we can lead the
world in global innovation and tech-
nology.
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from
North Dakota for his comments.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from West Virginia (Mrs. MIL-
LER), who represents a lot of the vic-
tims of bad energy policy or energy
policy that is not thought out.
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to speak in opposition to H.R. 9,
the Climate Action Now Act.
I represent West Virginia, an energy
State. Our natural resources power the
Nation, and our coal produces the steel
that is the backbone of our country’s
infrastructure. The bill my colleagues
across the aisle have introduced today
is a direct threat to the economy of my
State and to the security of our Na-
tion.
When President Obama entered into
the Paris Agreement in 2016, he made a
shortsighted, hasty decision which
passed egregious costs on to American
consumers and sent $1 billion in tax-
payer funds to subsidize other nations’
energy agendas without congressional
authorization—while never offering a
clear plan for our country to meet the
commitments made, aside from the
overall goal of killing energy produc-
tion in the U.S.
This is an attempt to further the war
on coal which decimated my State,
killing jobs, destroying businesses, and
exacerbating the opioid epidemic. We
face a bleakness which we are starting
to recover from, yet, now, Washington
liberals are restarting the charge.
We have seen unrealistic proposals
like the Green New Deal put forward
which would not only bankrupt our
country, but also kill our energy indus-
try once and for all. I will not stand
here and let that happen.
When President Trump withdrew
from the agreement in 2017, he showed
leadership. He showed the world that
he was willing to resist diplomatic
pressure in order to protect American
interests and ensure energy competi-
tiveness.
Those who support this legislation
aren’t telling the whole story on Amer-
ica’s energy production. The Paris
Agreement, since its creation, has not
accounted for the United States’ abun-
dance of natural resources and the hun-
dreds of thousands of Americans em-
ployed by the energy industry.
Additionally, the Paris Agreement
ignores that America produces afford-
able, reliable energy, including coal,
oil, and natural gas, and it also ignores
the importance that energy has to the
United States’ economy and national
security.
In the past 5 years, there has been a
110 percent increase in coal exports,
and we still have 259 billion tons of
coal reserves, the largest in the world.
Since 2008, the U.S. has increased
crude oil production by 48 percent and
natural gas production by 53 percent;
and looking forward, the increased ac-
cess to undeveloped energy production
could create as many as 690,000 jobs by
2030.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3333
April 30, 2019
Energy has been our past, and energy
is our future. It is important the
United States is already leading the
world in reducing greenhouse emissions
through innovation and technological
development. If my colleagues across
the aisle were interested in working
with Republicans to address climate
change, then they would not ignore the
fact that the United States has already
had the largest absolute decline of car-
bon emissions among all the countries
since the year 2000.
We did not need an international
agreement to do it. Forcing America to
reenter the Paris Agreement is not the
answer for climate concerns. It is re-
starting a tried-and-failed approach
which only leads to less jobs, a weaker
economy, and a less safe America.
The answer to the climate debate is
not a $93 trillion socialist restruc-
turing of our country. It is innovation,
and it is supporting new technology
like taking rare-earth minerals and
distilled water from previously used
coal ash. It is supporting carbon cap-
ture moving forward. It is recognizing
that, in the dead of winter when the re-
newable energy grids fall short, we can
rely on coal to get us through the next
polar vortex.
America cannot afford to reenter the
Paris Agreement. We cannot afford to
lose jobs. We cannot afford to lose se-
curity. We cannot afford the security
risks. We cannot afford to weaken our
economy. And we cannot afford to say
‘‘no’’ to innovation.
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr.
Speaker, might I inquire how much
time is remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 2 minutes remaining.
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr.
Speaker, I will now close.
Mr. Speaker, it has been fascinating
serving on the House Natural Re-
sources Committee, where we have
talked about efforts to stop pipelines
from being built under the auspices of
this is protecting our environment.
Mr. Speaker, study after study has
shown that, when you stop pipelines, it
doesn’t stop the utilization of oil and
gas. What it does is it puts that on
barges, on trains, and on trucks—less
safe means of transportation. The
safest thing you can do is put energy in
a pipeline. If you care about the envi-
ronment, that is what you should do.
Mr. Speaker, we had a hearing re-
cently in the Natural Resources Com-
mittee where we had a career Depart-
ment of the Interior official. We talked
to him and asked him: What happens
when you try and stop the supply of en-
ergy? Does that reduce the demand for
oil and gas?
Do you know what the response was?
This person has served in at least the
Clinton administration, all of these dif-
ferent Republican and Democratic ad-
ministrations. He said: No. As a matter
of fact, we have researched this exten-
sively. What it does is it causes us to
import more energy.
Mr. Speaker, I remind you of some of
the top nations we would import from:
Venezuela, Middle Eastern countries,
and Nigeria. We are giving them bil-
lions of dollars.
To put it in perspective on how much
this is, Mr. Speaker, in 2011, 58 percent
of our Nation’s trade deficit was attrib-
utable to our importing energy.
Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear. I am
going to reiterate what my friend from
Georgia said.
I have children. I care about the envi-
ronment. I taught outdoor education
classes for years, and I care about the
environment.
b 1545
I care about the environment. I know
that facts can be pesky little things,
but we have to introduce more science
and data into these decisions to make
sure that we are making informed, de-
liberate decisions that result in a bet-
ter global environment, not simply
coming in and squeezing the United
States to the benefit of China where
they end up releasing greater emissions
into our global environment.
That is a flawed strategy. It is what
this bill, H.R. 9, would do. I urge, once
again, rejection of this flawed ap-
proach.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
f
ISSUES OF THE DAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Arizona (Mr.
SCHWEIKERT) for 30 minutes.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, let
me take a quick moment and sort of
get adjusted here.
We are going to spend a couple of
minutes walking through some things
that I think are exciting, hopeful, and
worth getting our heads around.
Every week, I try to come to this
microphone when we are here to talk
about what I believe makes the future
really bright for all of us, everyone
from my 3-year-old—or 31⁄2-year-old, as
she corrects me—little girl to someone
who is moving into their retirement
years.
Once again, what is the greatest fra-
gility in our society? This is one that
is hard for us to get our heads around
or even talk about. It is our demo-
graphics.
Whether we like it or not, baby
boomers are retiring, and we have 74
million baby boomers. The last baby
boomer will hit 65 in about 81⁄2 years.
In 81⁄2 years, two workers, one retiree.
In 81⁄2 years, 50 percent of our spending
from this body, less interest, will be to
those 65 and up.
It is demographics. It is not Repub-
lican or Democrat. It is demographics.
At the same time, we have a substan-
tial collapse, fall, in our birthrates. As
you know, our birthrates now are well
below the replacement rates.
What do you do as a society? What do
you do as a government? What do we
do as a body here that is making public
policy to make the future bright?
We keep coming to the floor and
talking about that we believe there
are, functionally, five elements. It is
the adoption of technology. It is the
adoption of economic policies that
maximize economic growth through
tax policy that creates investment in
new technology for productivity; immi-
gration policy that maximizes new
Americans having talents that help us
grow the economy; regulatory policy
that uses technology and information
to regulate instead of bureaucratic fil-
ing in file cabinets, functionally; in-
centives to stay in the workforce and
incentives to enter the workforce.
As we have seen recently, millennial
females are moving into the workforce.
We still have a problem with millen-
nial males.
How about someone who is older?
Can we do certain incentives in Social
Security, Medicare, and other earned
benefits to encourage staying in the
workforce or even creating a second ca-
reer? We are going to have to redesign
a bit of those incentives that are in the
current earned benefits.
Can you create some incentives on
Social Security, saying, ‘‘If you will
continue to work, we are going to do
these things?’’ Because that labor force
participation is so important.
We have worked through these. Now
we try to come in and show what we
see working in our society. Then, I
want to talk a little bit about one of
these things, and that is the adoption
of technology.
This week, the majority, the Demo-
crats, will have a resolution on the
floor about the Paris climate accords. I
want to walk a bit through how tech-
nology, pro-growth technology, is the
solution. I am going to show you some
of the really optimistic things hap-
pening out there.
Let’s start swapping a couple of these
boards. First, I apologize for the first
slide. The scale is a little off, but it is
basically to make a simple point.
I am blessed to be on the Ways and
Means Committee. We had the debate
in December 2017. Over here, I was
hearing how the world was coming to
an end, how revenues were going to col-
lapse. It turns out that now we at least
have a good, comparable dataset. What
is the term? ‘‘Ceteris paribus,’’ where
you can equal to equal.
In 2017, before there was tax reform,
the first 6 months, and now we have
the 2019 first 6 months. Guess what?
Revenues are up, even though we are
already in the tax reform environment.
I was waved off by some much more
sensitive staffers. We had a list of
quotes from the majority, things they
said, their predictions, what their
economists said. I am not going to read
them.
But do understand, think about some
of the crazy things we heard about
what tax reform was going to do to the
revenues of the country, what it was
going to do to the economy, what it
was going to do to employment, what
it was going to do to labor force par-
ticipation.

H3334 April 30, 2019
They were all wrong. It is working.
Take a look at our economic growth.
Take a look at unemployment.
If I had come to you a couple of years
ago before tax reform and said our soci-
ety is going to have more jobs than we
have available workers, what would
you have said?
But it is reality. It is happening. We
are seeing data within what they call
the U–6, the underlying parts of the un-
employment statistics of our brothers
and sisters who have handicaps, who
have been long-term unemployed, who
have other life difficulties, moving into
the labor force.
There should be joy in this body and
also joy for the fact that all the pre-
dictions were wrong, that revenues
are—or ‘‘receipts’’ is the proper term.
Receipts are up. These 6 months with
tax reform compared to the 6 months
where we didn’t have tax reform, we
are taking in more money.
Will we ever get an apology from all
those who predicted doom and gloom?
Of course not. But could we just have a
little bit of joy that they were wrong,
that the math is good, that good things
are happening in this society?
We need to do more of it because,
without the growth, there is no way we
will keep our promises on Social Secu-
rity and Medicare and so many other
things. We must have economic
growth.
This slide right here I am going to
leave here for just a second, this slide
here, 2017. We don’t use, really, the 2018
fiscal year because the first 6 months
had part of it within tax reform, with-
out tax reform. But then the gray you
see up here is the 2019 first 6 months.
That is what that is.
I know I get teased a lot about the
slides, but at some point, if you are
talking about math—and substantially,
for all of us who are Members here, we
work in a math-free zone. It is a sin of
both parties because we often try to
make public policy by our feelings in-
stead of by our facts.
When we do public policy by feelings,
I will make the argument that we hurt
people because we intended good stuff,
but we just got our facts wrong. Could
you imagine if we did more like this
where we looked at the real math and
the real facts?
This is a month-to-month compari-
son. It shows you some months it has
been a little more, some months it has
been a little less. But, overall, $10 bil-
lion over 2017. The first 6 months, when
you compare them, it is working. It is
working.
When you start to look at the reve-
nues that are coming in, in what we
call FICA taxes—Social Security, un-
employment, Medicare—good things
are happening.
You saw it 10 days ago when the So-
cial Security actuaries put out their
report. You saw things like Social Se-
curity disability go from being incred-
ibly fragile, within just a couple of
years of running out of money, to gain-
ing 20 years of actuarial life. Some of
that was public policy. Some of that is
the fact that people are working.
You see other parts of the program
gaining a year’s worth of life. That is a
big deal when you consider the types of
numbers we are talking about. It is
working. The growth is providing us, as
a body, an opportunity to do positive
things for our community, for our
country, for our States. Instead, we
just seem to banter around here, doing
crazy.
Let’s walk around a couple of other
things. Do you remember the pre-
dictions? This was the long-term,
freaky-smart economists, particularly
on the left but even some of ours on
the right, who were predicting before
tax reform that the baseline economic
growth on the horizon was about 1.9,
1.8. That is where we were going to
grow. Also, the math that, over the 10
years, if you wanted to pay for tax re-
form, we only needed a 0.4 percent
growth.
Well, guess what? If you look at this
chart and realize, since tax reform,
what has happened in the GDP expan-
sion, we are blowing through those
numbers.
Now, it is too early to ever make a
prediction like, well, the additional
productivity, the additional number of
folks working, the less demand on so-
cial entitlements because there is
work, the number of Americans who
now have healthcare because they are
working and all these good things that
are happening in our society.
But the fact of the matter is, if you
look at this chart and look at the
growth in the size of our economy—and
this is a big economy, so when it grows
3 percent, it is a tremendous amount of
economic expansion—we are seeing
numbers that, once again, these really
smart economists were telling us we
could not hit.
Where is the joy around here? Wheth-
er you are on the left or the right, if
you care about people, if you claim you
truly love and care about people, the
fact is that so many of them have work
now and their wages are going up, par-
ticularly for our brothers and sisters
who are—sorry to use the geeky term—
at the lowest quartiles.
Do you remember the discussions
only a couple of years ago that, if
someone hadn’t finished high school,
they were destined to spend their lives
on the edge of poverty?
What have we seen in the last dozen
months? That that is the quartile hav-
ing the fastest movement in their
wages.
There should be joy that something
is breaking out, that something is hap-
pening out there when you see another
400,000 manufacturing jobs coming
back to the United States.
Remember ‘‘manufacturing is dead’’?
Except it isn’t. We did tax policy that
encouraged investment in plants and
equipment to raise productivity.
Why is that so important? When
someone gets a wage increase, when
you pay an American more money,
what is the classic economic formula?
It is inflation plus an improvement in
productivity. Wages go up according to
inflation and productivity.
What happens when American busi-
nesses, particularly in the manufac-
turing side, across the country are buy-
ing new plants and equipment because
of the incentives in tax reform? All of
a sudden, we are starting to see it is
working. Spiking of productivity is
happening.
We have a labor shortage. Wages are
going up. Shouldn’t there be joy that
the brothers and sisters out there who
were being written off by the really
smart economists just a couple of years
ago are back and good things are hap-
pening?
To be a little bit gratuitous, I know
these are hard to read, but if you just
look at the trend lines on the employ-
ment chart and think about some of
the other different quartiles, when we
geek out on the Joint Economic Com-
mittee, and those of our brothers and
sisters who are Hispanic or African
American or females or other quartiles,
where we try to break down and see
what is happening in employment sta-
tistics, we are hitting numbers that we
have never hit before in our society.
Something is working.
b 1600
How much happy talk have you heard
around here? In many ways, is it just
the nature of this institution is just
the rage-based politics that we bathe in
today? There are good things hap-
pening. We should be working on public
policy to make more of this happen and
more of this so this continues, so we
are a society of opportunity.
So this one is just sort of looking
at—I want to double-check myself.
This one I put up just because it was a
fascinating breakout, and this was ac-
tually more from last December and
then looking at what is happening.
We had actually been having some-
thing called a labor force participation
issue. It is sort of a geeky way of say-
ing, for a society to grow, you often
need two components.
You need capital stock. You need
money that people can borrow to in-
vest and to plant in equipment. Well, it
turns out the predictions that were
happening about tax reform, that cap-
ital stock was going to dry up, that ev-
eryone was going to go out and spend
the money and this and that, it turns
out savings, we have plenty of capital.
Savings rates went up.
The second part was labor supply,
and that one we have; we have a real
issue. What do you do to encourage
Americans who are not in the labor
pool to enter it?
Then last December, we had this un-
usual thing. All of a sudden, the num-
bers within what we call millennials,
millennial females started entering the
labor force, and all of a sudden, we
went over the 60—what? We had 62 or,
I think, 62.3 percent labor force partici-
pation—I am doing it from memory—a

number that lots of those smart econo-
mists just a couple years ago told us
we were not going to see again for an-
other 30 years. It has happened.
Maybe it is time we as a body have
an honest conversation that a lot of
the economists who have been advising
us are wrong, and the spirit of
entrepreneurism, of capitalism, those
things are actually working in our so-
ciety and providing real benefits.
Look, as a guy coming to the micro-
phone with lots of charts, but the math
is the math. Even though we work in a
math-free zone on occasion, there are
really good numbers in this.
So I want to actually sort of touch on
something else as we look at our pil-
lars of the future of economic growth
in our society.
You have heard discussions of the
Green New Deal or environmental pro-
tection as almost a Malthusian concept
that the economy must shrink to meet
these numbers. We want to argue that
is absolutely wrong.
The basic math set: Why has the
United States done so phenomenally
well in removing ACO2, a man-made
CO2, from the environment? It is be-
cause of our migration to natural gas.
We have gotten dramatically more
clean, efficient in our energy produc-
tion in the last decade, decade and a
half because of natural gas.
Well, in that case we should produce
more natural gas, right? It is working.
But there are actually other disrup-
tions of technology, and we are just
going to throw a couple of them up just
for the thought experiment, to under-
stand.
If this were, once again, a couple
years ago, the concept of pulling CO2
out of the air was almost considered
absurd—except for the fact it is hap-
pening. It is actually in Canada, but
there is actually a facility that is
going to be going online to almost, say,
what you would call an industrial scale
that will pull CO2 out of the air incred-
ibly efficiently.
It is a crazy concept, just crazy, ex-
cept it works. The technology is out
there.
How many of us, as we are debating
meeting the Paris accord numbers, are
saying here are actually things we can
do to get us to the Paris accord com-
mitments, which we are going to come
really close. If we would adopt certain
technologies, we get there.
I am going to ask you to reverse
some of those slides so we actually talk
about the nuclear power first. No, that
is carbon capture. Yes.
Sorry. We were running late, so we
ran up here with the boards.
This is just a quick thought experi-
ment for folks to understand for clean
power generation, and this is a couple
years old. I think this slide is based on
2015 numbers.
Do you see the yellow side? That is
all the solar that was new generation
capacity in the entire country in 2015.
The other side, the multicolored over
here, was the amount of absolutely
clean nuclear power generation that
went off-line. So even though 2015 was
a remarkable year of new, clean solar
generation, we actually didn’t really
gain that much because clean nuclear
power generation went off-line.
So this is the occasion of it is great
to be joyful about one, but you need to
make sure you have your math under-
standing what is going on.
Now, for us in Arizona, there is often
this debate, the discussion of uranium.
I don’t want to geek out too much, but
over the last 15 years or so, with the
collapse of the Soviet Union and world
energy markets on the nuclear side,
there was high-grade uranium, almost
weapons-grade, that was being stepped
down to go into reactors. Most of that
now has been used up.
So, actually, that slide. This is car-
bon capture. So what would happen to
you if I came to you today and said it
looks like our national labs have actu-
ally had a technology breakthrough
that is stunning?
So, instead of us who are not too far
from the Grand Canyon where we do
the drilling to pull uranium out of the
ground, which is always controversial
because you worry about water sup-
plies, but we need the uranium for all
sorts of things in our society, what
happens if there is never another land
uranium mine again? Because we
worked out the technology to pull ura-
nium out of seawater. It has happened.
It has happened.
Where is the joy around this place
that technology is breaking through
and providing us this sort of clean en-
ergy future in things that were just
sort of academic fantasies just a few
years ago and the technology is break-
ing through? This is wonderful. It is ex-
citing, and there should be joy on all
sides.
So let’s actually go to this next one,
and I am sorry for bouncing you back
and forth.
Outside Houston is an experimental
natural gas generation facility. It
doesn’t have a smokestack. It basically
actually uses the CO2 to spin the tur-
bines. No smokestack. They capture
every bit of the CO2, and they are actu-
ally apparently going to go from, I
think it is—forgive me if I got my
math wrong—30 megawatts to 300.
They are going to go to an industrial-
or utility-grade scale.
But the fact of the matter is they are
generating power without a smoke-
stack, and they capture every bit of
the CO2 and can sell it, convert it into
other products. We have the tech-
nology. It is up and running right now.
They worked it out.
This should be joyful. If you want to
actually have a bright powered future
that provides the energy for the econ-
omy so the economy grows so we can
keep our financial commitments but
we want to protect the environment,
we need to be talking about how we are
going to bring more of this type of
technology into our communities in-
stead of sort of the Malthusian cra-
ziness of things that are in things like
the Green New Deal, where we are
going shut down this, shut down that,
shut down this. There is a progrowth
way to get there.
Those of us on the Ways and Means
Committee even a year ago, Repub-
licans and Democrats, we actually
passed some more tax credit incentives
for when you produce the CO2, where do
you put it? Well, you actually can get
a little bit of credit if you put it in
plastic or cement or put it in the curb
that is being put into your neighbor-
hood or actually put it into the ground
to do recovery to bring up more hydro-
carbons.
It is actually just really exciting, and
the technology is working. We need to
be talking about technology and its fu-
ture and the disruption it is bringing
and the bright, cleaner future environ-
ment it brings with it.
I brought this slide up because it is
part of the thought experiment on this
theme. Who here is concerned about
plastic in the ocean? I mean, look, the
Speaker is a good guy. He understands.
I was a big scuba diver before I got this
job. Now there is never time.
Ninety percent of the plastic in the
ocean comes from 10 rivers, 8 of them
in Southeast Asia, 2 in Africa. It is not
the straw that you are going to not be
allowed to use here in D.C. It is not the
plastics in the United States. It is that
10 rivers bring 90 percent of the plastic
in the ocean.
If we actually cared about plastic in
the ocean, wouldn’t we actually take
our foreign aid, our environmental aid,
our technology aid and say: ‘‘We know
where the plastic in the ocean is com-
ing from. Let’s go help those 10 rivers,
8 of them in Asia, 2 in Africa. Let’s
help them get cleaner’’?
That is Republican, Democrat, we
want clean oceans. If you care about
the plastic issue, doing crazy things
like: ‘‘Well, I am going to actually af-
firm that I am a good person and I care
by banning straws in my community
even though it will have absolutely
zero effect of making the oceans clean-
er’’—because, in the United States, our
plastic substantially does not end up in
the ocean. Let’s stop the theater and
do things that actually provide solu-
tions.
This one just drives me insane be-
cause I care a lot about it. And it could
be from the Foreign Affairs Committee
to Natural Resources to Energy and
Commerce, they should all say: ‘‘Hey,
what do we do to help other countries
not pump plastic into our oceans from
those 10 rivers?’’ And if you did that,
instantly, you just stopped 90 percent
of the plastic waste going into the
ocean.
That is a solution, but that is actu-
ally using—what is that crazy thing?
Oh, yes—math to do public policy in-
stead of feelings. But instead, around
here, we get rewarded for doing theat-
rics.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3336 April 30, 2019
Now, the next board we are going to
put up is the great thought experi-
ment, and this one actually is the ulti-
mate disruption that I think may even
happen in my lifetime, and I may lack
some of the elegance or eloquence—ex-
cuse me—on how to describe it.
You all remember your high school
or college botany biology class. You
know, a plant cell from a couple mil-
lion years ago, it has a certain issue of
it wants to grow and it grabs an oxygen
cell when it meant to grab a carbon
molecule. Sorry. And then it spends
lots of energy purging that one because
‘‘I don’t want the oxygen molecule; I
want the carbon molecule to grow.’’
Okay. I don’t mean to geek out, but
it is a big deal. It is an inherent ineffi-
ciency in our plants that is a couple
million years old.
It turns out, United States Govern-
ment and a couple of university labs
may have broken the code on the Holy
Grail of plant biology, and with a
tweak in the genetic code, a 40 percent
improvement in growth.
Do the thought experiment with me.
What happens tomorrow if, on the
same piece of land you are growing
soybeans or corn or cotton or grass in
your yard, you have a 40 percent im-
provement in efficiency? How much
less water are you using? How much
less fertilizer are you using? How much
less fuel? How much less land?
It also means, mathematically, you
also feed the world for the next couple
hundred years.
World agriculture, if you wanted to
do part of the thought experiment,
world agriculture produces 2.2 times
the amount of greenhouse gasses as
every car on Earth. Think about that.
So world agriculture, the math is you
produce about 2.2 times more green-
house gasses than every car on Earth.
The adoption of this genetic change in
our agriculture around the world would
be as if you removed every single car
off the face of the Earth. That is a dis-
ruption.
Now, it is going to also have implica-
tions on what agricultural land is
worth. I mean, it will have a huge dis-
ruption across the world. But if you
truly claim you care about the envi-
ronment, and someone like me who
does taxes and financial and economic
growth as their specialty here in Con-
gress reads articles like this and sees
the disruption in the future for the en-
vironment, why isn’t this the discus-
sion here?
If this is real, and we all know in
seed stock, you can roll it out in just a
few years. What would happen if in just
a few years, it would be like you re-
moved every single car off the face of
the Earth? That is what something like
this equals.
We should be joyful here. We live in
a time where technology is moving so
fast it is presenting us solutions, and
we need to stop the debates around this
place that sound like we are all still in
the 1990s.
The solutions are all around us, they
are rolling out of our labs, they are
rolling out of actually people’s garages.
Smart people all around us and around
the world are producing the solutions.
We need to embrace and move those
forward, or we can do what we are
doing here so far this year, and that is
engage in the political theater of rage
and completely avoid the optimism of
the solutions that are at our doorstep.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-

Let us pray.
Sovereign Lord, our help in ages past
and our hope for years to come, we
magnify Your Name. Lord, we sense
that our battles are not simply with
flesh and blood, but we war against
principalities and powers. Thank You
for providing us with spiritual weapons
for our warfare. Forgive us when we
chase the temporary and flee from the
permanent. Inspire us to capture our
thoughts and actions, making them
subject to Your will.
Lord, give our lawmakers today an
awareness of the complexity of the
warfare between good and evil. Speak
to our Senators when they call to You
for guidance. Remind them that truth
crushed to Earth will rise again.
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-

f
NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
the Senate is in the midst of consid-
ering several more well-qualified nomi-
nees for service in the executive branch
and on our Nation’s Federal courts. We
are doing so in a more reasonable, effi-
cient manner—more in line with this
body’s tradition—thanks to the modest
reform the Senate passed just a few
weeks ago.
Until recently, our colleagues across
the aisle had succeeded in subjecting
even the least controversial nominees
to day after day of so-called debate.
Countless hours of valuable floor
time were spent on individuals who
passed through committees of jurisdic-
tion without any opposition and for in-
dividuals whose final confirmation
votes frequently cleared 90 votes, but
now the Senate has begun to clear the
backlog and put more public servants
to work on behalf of the American peo-
ple.
Last evening we voted to advance the
nomination of William Cooper of Mary-
land to serve as general counsel at the
Department of Energy. Mr. Cooper’s
nomination first arrived in the Senate
9 months ago. It has twice been re-
ported favorably by our colleagues on
the Energy and Natural Resources
Committee. Mr. Cooper of Florida has
waited even longer to begin his service
as Assistant Secretary of State for Po-
litical-Military Affairs, and the story
is not much different for the jurists
waiting to finally be confirmed to Fed-
eral district courts either.
So I look forward to the swift consid-
eration of this week’s slate of nomi-
nees, and I would urge each of my col-
leagues to join me in voting for their
confirmation.
HEALTHCARE
On another matter, lest there be any
doubt that my Democratic colleagues
here in the Congress are serious about
their party’s radical left turn, the
House Rules Committee is actually
holding a hearing today on their pro-
posal to outlaw private health insur-
ance and force every American into a
new government-run system.
As I have said, this grand scheme
ought to be called Medicare for None.
Democrats want to drain the popular
program that seniors have relied on for
more than 50 years and slap its name
on a brand-new, untried, untested gov-
ernment-run system, and this thing
they have cooked up would become the
only option—the only option—avail-
able to American families.
Democrats are so confident that
Americans will love their one-size-fits-
all government plan that they feel the
need to ban the private sector from
competing with it.
This is a fantasy pulled from the far-
thest corners of the left, but now lead-
ing Democrats are proudly embracing
it.
Here is the chairman of the House
Rules Committee: ‘‘It’s a serious pro-
posal that deserves serious consider-
ation.’’
Well, it certainly is a serious pro-
posal for more than 180 million Ameri-
cans who would be unceremoniously
kicked off of their private insurance
plans. It certainly is a serious proposal
for the tens of millions of Americans
who paid into Medicare so it would ac-
tually be there now when they needed

it—not distorted into something to-
tally different.
This is a particularly important
point, given the serious challenges that
Medicare is already facing. The Admin-
istrator for the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services recently ex-
plained that ‘‘the program’s main trust
fund for hospital services can only pay
full benefits for seven more years,’’ and
she noted the particular irony that this
‘‘sobering dose of reality’’ is being de-
livered as ‘‘some are calling for a com-
plete government takeover of the
American healthcare system.’’
On our current trajectory, as soon as
7 years from now, in 2026, ‘‘doctors,
hospitals, and nursing homes would not
receive their full compensation from
the program and patients could face
more of the financial burden.’’ That is
from the New York Times.
In other words, this is a time for
shoring up the existing health insur-
ance that our seniors like and rely on,
not a time to risk it—risk it all—by
packing millions and millions more—
the whole rest of the Nation—into that
very system for the sake of a snappy
campaign promise.
The last time Democrats had unified
control of the House, the Senate, and
the White House, of course, they imple-
mented sweeping changes that the
American people were assured would
keep healthcare costs down. Lots of
promises were made. Lots of promises
were broken.
Many families are now saddled with
sky-high premiums, deductibles, and
out-of-pocket costs, not to mention
dwindling choices, and now Democrats
are back for another, even bigger bite
of the apple.
The last thing American families
need is even more top-down, one-size-
fits-all social engineering. We need to
take practical steps to address what
really matters most to American fami-
lies—healthcare costs. We need to pre-
serve what works, fix what doesn’t,
bring costs down, and preserve Medi-
care. That is the sensible approach
that American families deserve. That
is the practical solutions-oriented ap-
proach that Republicans are com-
mitted to.
But as we have already seen across
the Capitol this week, our Democratic
friends want to wheel out the drawing
board yet again and take another big
whack at the healthcare plans Ameri-
cans already rely on.
TRIBUTE TO JOHN ABEGG
Madam President, on one final mat-
ter, one of the most bittersweet sub-
jects that Senators discuss on the floor
is the departure of trusted staff. On one
hand, I am certainly glad for any op-
portunity to highlight members of my
all-star team, especially someone as
diligent and tireless as the subject of
my remarks today. The vast majority
of the late-night hours and weekend
projects that go on around here are re-
paid with much private gratitude but
little to no public fanfare. So I am glad
I can devote some time today to a long-
time adviser who has earned my com-
plete trust and thrown himself heart,
mind, and soul into serving Kentucky
and our Nation for nearly two decades.
But I am very unhappy that the occa-
sion for this is that John Abegg is tak-
ing leave of the Senate to pursue the
next chapter for himself and his fam-
ily. John, you see, is my chief counsel.
He arrived on our team before I was
whip and before I was leader. President
Clinton was still in office, and it was
one of the more fortunate days of my
career when this bright, young lawyer
walked into my office. He brought an
outsized share of shrewd judgment,
sharp wit, and an eagle eye for detail
along with him.
Some 19 years later, nearly all of
that is still the case. There might be a
little more seasoning. The reading
glasses might be a little thicker. But
every ounce of the talent and dedica-
tion that were so evident back then
have remained part of my operation
ever since.
John has literally flourished. He has
become an institution in his own right
here in the Senate and in the legal
community, and I feel so fortunate to
have had him by my side.
Now, today, it may all sound quite
impressive—the chief counsel who ad-
vises the Senate majority leader on ju-
dicial nominations and countless im-
portant policy matters. But John can
attest that the original job description
19 years ago wasn’t so glamorous.
It was the beginning of the 107th Con-
gress. I secured a temporary seat on
the Judiciary Committee. It was an im-
portant assignment, but it came with
some caveats. Namely, I would be last
on the docket to speak at hearings. So
most often, as a courtesy, I would yield
my speaking time and avoid holding up
the proceedings.
But this will give you a picture of
how unbelievably industrious and me-
ticulous John is, because my bright,
young counsel saw this as a zero li-
cense to slack off or let up on the com-
prehensive briefing books he would pre-
pare for me.
No matter how many times I opted
only to listen and cast my vote, the
painstaking, encyclopedic preparations
came pouring in—just in case. I may
have been the new guy on the block,
but John made sure that every week I
showed up loaded for bear, with exten-
sive background information, potential
amendments, and suggested questions,
because, you see, John Abegg is never,
ever caught flat-footed—not ever, and
if you are around him, he will not let
you be caught flat-footed either. For
John, a job worth doing is a job worth
doing to perfection—or as close to per-
fection as possible.
The man literally handled everything
from nominations to policy matters to
his own colleagues’ questions about
Senate ethics. Now, all of that was in a
half-day’s work, by the way, and yet
every one of these subjects, every sin-
gle time, was handled with total com-
mitment, stunning professionalism,
and the utmost care. Zero stones were
left unturned, zero angles left uncon-
sidered—a true ‘‘lawyer’s lawyer’’ from
dawn until well after dusk, and then all
over again.
We are talking about a mindset that
you would think even a top profes-
sional might reserve for one marquee
project every couple of months. John
brought that high standard to 14 dif-
ferent things before lunchtime, and he
did it every day for almost 20 years.
Now, I realize that the picture I have
painted so far may sound like an in-
credible team asset but not necessarily
the most warm and fuzzy individual. It
is true that John was never afraid to
state his views directly to his peers or
his chief of staff or to me. Now, I am
not sure anyone on my staff has been
able to deliver hard news, when nec-
essary, with more clarity or greater
courage, but he has been equally reli-
able for the best laugh line in most
meetings, the perfectly timed joke. He
literally lifts everyone up by bringing
the house down.
And for all of the priorities he
juggles, anybody who has seen John in
the presence of his lovely wife and
their three girls knows exactly what
his real top priority is.
During his tenure, John has offered
me peerless advice and analysis on
countless judicial nominations. A ma-
jority of the sitting Supreme Court was
confirmed while John has been on this
job. He takes the judiciary as seriously
as it deserves. The third branch and
our Nation are better for his service.
Then, there is a lengthy catalog of
legislative work that John has steered
and helped me to shape. Some of his
legacy is what you might expect from a
no-nonsense lawyer for a Republican
Member of this body—work on causes
like class action reform or medical li-
ability reform.
But anyone who spent time around
John would be equally unsurprised by
the long nights he put in to help bring
about comprehensive legislation to ad-
dress the opioid crisis or crack down on
the scourge of human trafficking or to
help local law enforcement care for
fallen officers’ families and search for
missing children. In every single case,
John was on the case—rock-solid legal
advice, keen strategy. Before an issue
even popped up, he would have his fin-
ger on the pulse of the Senate.
Once we were in the thick of it, he
was often our field general and back-
bone, and after our work was done, but
only then, it was time for a well-earned
smile.
But John’s smile is widest when he is
talking about his beautiful wife Heidi
and their three lovely daughters, Abi-
gail, Ingrid, and Erika.
So while his friends and colleagues
here in the Senate are sad to see John
go, we know he does nothing rashly,
and so we are confident that he has
thought this calculus through as com-
pletely as he has everything else.
Fewer full-day hearings and more
bedtime stories. Fewer dinners crack-
ing up his colleagues over takeout food

during some all-night session and more
times at his own kitchen table.
Well, after nearly two decades, I sup-
pose we can let this slacker head for

Abegg is the one who made it.

MEDICARE
Mr. THUNE. Madam President,
shortly before Easter, the junior Sen-
ator from Vermont introduced a new
version of his so-called Medicare for
All plan. Given the staggering pricetag
of his previous plan, it was reasonable
to wonder if he would think about pro-
ducing something that was at least a
bit more modest and achievable. So
what is the new plan like? Is it any
more realistic? Did he figure out a way
to actually pay for a government take-
over of healthcare? Well, the answer is
no. In fact, the new plan is even worse.
It is more unrealistic, more costly, and
even more likely to result in massive
tax hikes on middle-class Americans.
Analysis of a previous version of the
Vermont Senator’s Medicare for All
plan found that it would cost $32 tril-
lion over 10 years. Now, to put that
number in perspective, that is more
money than the Federal Government
has spent combined in the last 8 years
on everything—defense, law enforce-
ment, Social Security, Medicare, Med-
icaid, education, the environment, ag-
riculture, Foreign Affairs—everything.
Here is what the Washington Post
had to say back in 2017 about the
pricetag for government-run
healthcare:
But the government’s price tag would be
astonishing. When Sen. Bernie Sanders . . .
proposed a ‘‘Medicare for all’’ health plan in
his presidential campaign, the nonpartisan
Urban Institute figured that it would raise
government spending by $32 trillion over 10
years, requiring a tax increase so huge that
even the democratic socialist Mr. Sanders
did not propose anything close to it.
Fast-forward to today, and, once
again, the Senator from Vermont has
proposed a government-run health plan
without even coming close to pre-
senting a way to pay for it. The only
difference this time is that the pricetag
is likely to be even higher—much high-
er. Why? Because the Senator from
Vermont’s new plan also includes cov-
erage for long-term care—an incredibly
expensive part of the healthcare sys-
tem.
The Democrats’ last attempt to have
the government run a long-term care
program fell apart before it was even
implemented because the program was
not financially viable. Thirty-two tril-
lion dollars was a staggering enough
figure, and now we are talking about
having the Federal Government spend
even more. Where do the Democrats
think we are going to find the money?
The list of proposed tax hikes that the
Senator from Vermont released would
not even come close to covering the es-
timated cost of his original plan, much
less the cost of his new, expanded Medi-
care fantasy. This is not a plan that
can be paid for by using the Democrats’
favorite solution of taxing the rich. If
Medicare for All ever became law, it
would be paid for on the backs of mid-
dle-class families.
It is impossible to have a discussion
of Medicare for All—or maybe we
should call it Medicare for None given
the fact that it would end Medicare as
we know it—without focusing on the
insane pricetag. Yet that is not the
only unrealistic aspect of this bill. The
Senator from Vermont is proposing to
implement his plan in 4 years. That is
right—in 4 years. The Obama adminis-
tration had 31⁄2 years to implement the
ObamaCare exchanges, which were in-
tended to cover a tiny fraction of the
number of people who would be covered
under Medicare for All. As I am sure
most Americans remember, the govern-
ment couldn’t put together a working
website in that time period. The idea
that the government could successfully
transition more than 180 million Amer-
icans into government-run healthcare
in the space of 4 years is ludicrous, not
to mention what that healthcare would
be like when Americans would have
made it into the system.
As a recent Vox article pointed out,
the Senator from Vermont is proposing
extremely generous benefits—benefits
that are substantially more generous
than those that are offered by other
countries with government-run
healthcare. Yet, again, he has no viable
way of paying for any of this. The like-
lihood that Americans would actually
see all of those benefits is slim.
When the government reaches a point
where it can’t pay for all of the bene-
fits it promised, it has basically two
options. It can raise taxes even fur-
ther—and that would undoubtedly hap-
pen; I think that is a given—but the
government would also inevitably have
to turn to the other option: the kind of
control over healthcare we have seen in
other countries with socialized medi-
cine. Americans would also undoubt-
edly soon find themselves facing that
other hallmark of socialized medicine:
long wait times for care.
The leader recently said on the floor
that Republicans stand for ‘‘preserving
what works and fixing what doesn’t.’’
That is exactly it. Republicans know
that our healthcare system is not per-
fect. We are committed to finding solu-
tions to make healthcare more afford-
able, but we don’t think tearing down
our entire system is the answer. We
can address the healthcare challenges
we face without ripping away Ameri-
cans’ health insurance and forcing
them into a government-run, one-size-
fits-all plan and then raising their
taxes to pay for it. We can make
healthcare more affordable without de-
stroying Medicare as we know it.
Democrats’ socialist healthcare fan-
tasy sounds nice in theory, but the re-
ality would be anything but—huge new
tax hikes for the middle class, long
wait times and lower quality of care,
government involvement in your
healthcare decisions, and no choice at
all when it comes to your insurance.
Let’s hope the Democratic Party
halts its mad rush to the extreme left
before Americans are forced to live
under the ugly reality of socialized
medicine.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

NOMINATION OF R. CLARKE COOPER
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I
rise in support of the nomination of R.
Clarke Cooper to be an Assistant Sec-
retary of the Bureau of Political-Mili-
tary Affairs at the Department of
State.
The Bureau of Political-Military Af-
fairs plays a critical role in the State
Department and in broader diplomatic
and national security efforts around
the world. Every day, the Bureau
works to ensure that our foreign policy
goals are driving our security partner-
ships and security assistance around
the world, including nearly $100 billion
annually in arms sales.
I am prepared to support Mr. Coo-
per’s nomination as Assistant Sec-
retary because I believe he brings expe-
rience, insight, and leadership that will
benefit the Bureau and our foreign pol-
icy. I also expect Mr. Cooper to uphold
the commitments he made during his
confirmation hearing, including that
he will not only be responsive to all in-
quiries from the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee and its staff about the
Bureau’s work but that he will also
proactively keep us fully informed
about issues under his jurisdiction.
3D GUNS
Madam President, if confirmed by
the Senate, Mr. Cooper will assume his
position at a time when the Bureau is
at the center of, quite frankly, some
appalling decisions by the Trump ad-
ministration that will undermine the
safety and security of Americans
abroad.
I cannot wrap my head around the
administration’s policies, for example,
on the issue of 3D-printed firearms.
The Trump administration apparently
believes it is a good idea to indiscrimi-
nately distribute around the world—to
foreign adversaries, terrorist organiza-
tions, and future mass shooters—the
literal blueprints for using 3D printers

to make nearly undetectable firearms
and components.
Apparently, the Trump administra-
tion believes this information should
be readily available to anyone as it
seeks to transfer the export control li-
censing of military-style firearms and
ammunition from the Department of
State to the less stringent Department
of Commerce. Even the Commerce De-
partment has admitted that its own
regulations will not permit them to ef-
fectively stop the publication of these
firearm blueprints online.
It is not difficult to imagine the dev-
astating consequences of this reckless
decision, which will make more lethal
weapons available to more thuggish re-
gimes and facilitate their illicit trans-
fer to criminals and terrorists. We are
talking about making it easier for a
criminal to build his own weapons
without having to get a background
check. We are talking about making it
easier for terrorists to board a plane
with deadly guns, perhaps to hijack
them and use the aircraft as weapons,
just as the 9/11 terrorists did. We are
talking about making it easier for
armed militants to enter a U.S. Em-
bassy undetected, endangering the
lives of our diplomats abroad. Simply
put, we are talking about preventable
tragedies made possible by the
thoughtless actions of this administra-
tion. These are undetectable. That is
the big challenge here. Indeed, this de-
cision could place all American citi-
zens and officials—even the President
himself—at greater security risk.
It is not too late to reverse this mis-
take. The Trump administration can
halt its decision to transfer the export
jurisdiction to the Commerce Depart-
ment. At the very least, the adminis-
tration could leave the blueprints for
producing undetectable, 3D-printed
firearms under the stronger regulatory
controls of the Department of State.
HUMAN RIGHTS
Madam President, on a separate note,
I have made clear to Mr. Cooper that
the Bureau of Political-Military Af-
fairs has a moral and strategic impera-
tive to consider human rights and end-
use monitoring when it comes to mak-
ing decisions about arms sales, trans-
fers, and security assistance to foreign
countries.
Over the past 2 years, it has been
troubling to see human rights consider-
ations take a backseat. That includes
the President’s recent decision to re-
vise the Conventional Arms Transfer
Policy to disregard a country’s human
rights record. With Saudi Arabia, the
Khashoggi murder, and the debacle of
the Yemen war fresh on our minds, we
need no reminder of the consequences
of the President’s impulse to put profit
above all else, including respect for
basic human rights. Human rights are
not just a nice gesture; they are funda-
mental American values and critical to
advancing peace, justice, democracy,
and stability around the world.
We must ask ourselves what we as a
nation want America to be. Are we a
beacon of hope for the oppressed or
simply the biggest arms merchant to
the world? Count me and many of my
colleagues as standing firmly for the
former, and I hope Mr. Cooper will
stand with us.
NOMINATION PROCESS
Madam President, finally, for weeks,
we have heard from the President, the
majority leader, and other Republicans
about vacancies at the State Depart-
ment and why that contributed to the
supposed need for Senator MCCONNELL
to exercise the nuclear option on nomi-
nees. As I recently explained on the
floor, Republicans need to point the
finger at their President. In many
cases, the President has simply failed
to put forward nominees for key na-
tional security positions. When he does
put forward nominees, too often these
individuals have not been thoroughly
vetted, and issues that would be dis-
qualifying for nominees in any other
administration have simply been
glossed over.
It turns out there is another issue
that speaks directly to the flimsiness
of the majority leader’s rationale for
invoking the nuclear option, and that
is the fact that Republicans themselves
are blocking State Department nomi-
nees, including career employees nomi-
nated to be Ambassadors to Ecuador
and Cambodia. These nominees were
reported out of the Foreign Relations
Committee by voice vote and without
any controversies several weeks ago.
They could have been confirmed and
on the ground in their posts prior to
Easter recess. Instead, their nomina-
tions are languishing because the ma-
jority leader has refused to move. So I
now call on Senator MCCONNELL to
stop playing politics with the State De-
partment and get these career nomi-
nees confirmed.
As I have said repeatedly, when pre-
sented with qualified, well-vetted
nominees, my staff and I will work
around the clock to advance the con-
firmation process. I would ask for the
same from my Republican colleagues.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

REMEMBERING RICHARD LUGAR
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, over the
weekend, Indiana lost a giant in Rich-
ard G. Lugar. Senator Lugar spent 36
years as a Member of this body, and I
rise today to celebrate his life, which
made the world a better, safer place to
live.
I had the pleasure in the early 2000s
to work on Senator Lugar’s staff, and I
had a front row seat to history, watch-
ing a true statesman at work. He stood
by me as I took my oath right here in
this Chamber. I will never forget his
support of me and of so many others
throughout the years.
Senator Lugar’s reserved and quiet
demeanor sometimes might have led
people to believe he was something less
than competitive. In truth, he was one
of the most competitive people I have
ever encountered. Senator Lugar was a
runner, and his office competed every
year in the Capital Challenge, the com-
petitive race between legislative staffs.
Senator Lugar had a member of his
staff actually track everyone’s time
and their improvement, or lack there-
of, from year to year. I think that
spreadsheet still exists somewhere
today. When I was going through the
hiring process to be a legislative assist-
ant in the Senator’s office, I went
through the normal series of ques-
tions—my academic background, my
professional experiences, my policy
knowledge, my interest in working in
the office. But at the very end of the
interview, the Senator asked me a
pointed question. He led into the ques-
tion by indicating that he had seen
listed some hobbies on my résumé, and
one of those hobbies was running. So
he asked me pointedly: How fast can
you run 3 miles? I quickly told him I
thought I could break 18 minutes. A
half hour later, I got a phone call say-
ing I was hired. Looking back, I am not
so sure it was because of my policy
chops.
I learned a lot working for this man.
I fondly remember his penchant for ice
cream and the stacks and stacks of
books in his office. I believe he read
every one.
Senator Lugar would from time to
time invite staff members or interns to
run with him on the Mall. There was
one rule: Never ever run in front of the
Senator. He was, after all, a leader, a
Rhodes Scholar, a Navy veteran, mayor
of Indianapolis where he spurred eco-
nomic growth, which is still spoken of
today, by consolidating the city and
county governments into Unigov.
As a U.S. Senator, he led on food se-
curity, energy independence, and free
trade. At a time when nuclear pro-
liferation was regarded as civilization’s
greatest threat, Senator Lugar helped
save the world. The Nunn-Lugar Act,
for which he is most well known, has
led to the securing and destruction of
thousands of weapons of mass destruc-
tion and delivery devices.
Dick Lugar was a very shrewd politi-
cian until his last days. His instincts
were very good. I know this from per-
sonal experience. In fact, last year, he
and I did a forum together at Indiana
University. Present on the panel were a
former World Food Prize winner, the
leader of an international NGO, Sen-
ator Lugar, and I. After formal presen-
tations were done and some questions
were asked by the moderator, ques-
tions were opened up to the audience.
Some particularly difficult questions
were tendered initially, and whenever
one of those questions was asked, Sen-
ator Lugar would put on that trade-
mark smile of his—and everyone back

home knows what I am talking about.
He would just look over at me and let
the junior Senator from Indiana field
that question. After about three or four
times, I decided it was his turn, so I
tried to use his method right back at
him. He simply smiled back at me
until I couldn’t stand the silence any-
more. I was the first to break. The man
still had the gift. The entire audience
laughed. He was not to be underesti-
mated.
He was not to be underestimated as a
boss in the impact he could have on a
young, idealistic staffer looking for
role models in public life. He was not
to be underestimated as a mentor who
understood that the most important
thing a leader can do is to simply set a
good example—comport yourself in a
way that others might want to model.
He was not to be underestimated as a
human being. Richard Lugar had a
heart. He ran for office not to be some-
body, but to do things, important
things to improve the lives of hundreds
of millions—in the end, billions of peo-
ple around the world.
Dick Lugar was the gold standard. He
leaves a legacy as an exemplar of wis-
dom, civility, and bipartisanship. Al-
ways staying true to his temperament,
he was a quiet man, a dignified states-
man. He thought before he spoke. He
emphasized substance over personality.
In short, he set the bar for public lead-
ers, and he set it high. I would go fur-
ther and say that he set the bar high
for leaders, more generally.
We should all look to Dick Lugar. We
should all learn from his example.
I am not sure we will ever see an-
other Richard Lugar. I sure pray we do.
May God watch over him and his fam-
ily during this difficult time.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana.
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, you just
heard the story from Senator YOUNG.
He had the benefit of knowing Richard
Lugar more recently.
My story is a little different. I am
going to have to think back to 45 years
ago. I was between my sophomore and
junior years at Wabash College. I never
knew I had an interest in politics, let
alone that someday I would be serving
in the Lugar seat. How life drives you
in certain directions.
I remember that Richard Lugar took
on Senator Birch Bayh, who I think
had served several terms—he recently
passed away himself, another icon of
Hoosier politics—and I said that I
wanted to get involved. When you have
a man like Richard Lugar, who took a
risk, stuck his neck out to run for
mayor after he had been on a school
board—ironically, I was on a school
board for 10 years when I decided to
stick my neck out to run for State leg-
islator—you think back about how life
drives you in certain directions.
With Richard Lugar, most notably,
during his entire life, he lived with
character and integrity.
I think back to when I first met him.
I was dressed in a white turtleneck
with a blue blazer and plaid pants.
Wow, I can’t believe we even dressed
that way back in the seventies. I found
those pictures stored away in a box
about 4 or 5 years ago. I pulled them
out, and my high school sweetheart,
my wife now—she and I were looking at
Dick as he was preparing to run for
Senate. The look on our faces, looking
into the face of someone with his stat-
ure, really stood out.
When you get this far down the trail,
I get asked: Who were your mentors
who got you to run for school board,
State rep, and then the Senate? Most-
ly, it would have been my parents and
my community. I say that often. But if
there was one politician I would have
looked up to, even when I wasn’t cer-
tain I ever wanted to get involved in
politics at all, I would look back to
that year, back in the midseventies,
when I decided to do it.
He was in the Senate for a long time.
During the entirety of his terms, he al-
ways did it to where, as a Hoosier and
as an American, you were proud of
him. The thing he did as well as anyone
is that he was able to look across the
aisle in times when we were less polar-
ized. Now, I think that trait, more than
ever, would be something we need to
pay attention to.
When you close the chapter on one
individual’s life, one whose life was as
exemplary as Richard Lugar’s, it
should mostly be inspiration for others
to follow in his footsteps.
I know in the State of Indiana—in an
op-ed that was just put out by an indi-
vidual, it cites Richard Lugar as the
most important public servant ever to
come from our State. Gosh, I think you
would have to say there was a lot of
credibility to push that point of view.
All I can tell you is that for the time
I am here in the Lugar seat, I intend to
do what he did. On things he knew a
little something about, he stuck his
neck out, made a statement, and he
led. In the entirety of his career here in
the Senate, he was impeccable in his
integrity and character. Gosh, we could
sure use a good dose of that in this day
and age.
It is an honor for me to be serving in
his seat, and I hope to do even half as
good a job in my stint here as he did
over many, many years.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The Democratic leader is recognized.
MUELLER REPORT
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
the Mueller report, released earlier
this month, was divided into two sec-
tions. One is detailing the concerted
and coordinated effort by President
Putin to interfere in our Presidential
election, an effort the Trump campaign
welcomed and at times amplified. It
also included a second section, which
laid out a pattern of dishonesty and in-
terference with a Federal investigation
by the President and his team.
Now, today I want to focus the Sen-
ate’s attention on the first half of the
report: the coordinated effort by Presi-
dent Putin to interfere in our elec-
tions, which is an unbelievable thing, a
threat to our democracy, and some-
thing every American should be con-
cerned about.
Though we have long known about
President Putin’s interference in the
2016 elections—we have all known
about that—the conclusions of the
Mueller report demand a vigorous re-
sponse by this Congress to ensure that
Putin pays a significant price for his
actions and that Putin and other ad-
versaries will not consider a similar ac-
tion in the 2020 election cycle. What oc-
curred in 2016 was nothing short of an
assault on our democracy and an at-
tack on our most revered traditions. It
was the kind of foreign influence feared
by the Framers and warned about in
the Federalist Papers. It is the very
reason we have an emoluments clause
in our Constitution.
Even so, President Trump and his ad-
ministration met these attacks with
apathy. The President has routinely
sought to undermine and weaken ef-
forts by this Chamber to sanction Rus-
sia. The Treasury Department recently
cut a deal to reduce sanctions on the
Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska.
Just last week, the Times reported
that then-Homeland Security Sec-
retary Nielsen was told to not even
mention election security in front of
the President, even though she report-
edly considered it one of America’s
highest priorities as we head into 2020.
In the face of the administration’s
disturbing indifference, it is clear the
Senate must act. In the past, this body
has proudly come together, bipartisan,
to pass sanctions on Russia. We have
not done enough yet to hold the guilty
parties of 2016 accountable, and we
must do more to ensure that a foreign
power cannot meddle in our elections
ever again. With that in mind, I have
three proposals for my colleagues to
consider.
First, we should pass additional sanc-
tions against President Putin, his cro-
nies, and other adversaries considering
similar malign activities. There are
multiple bipartisan sanctions bills
awaiting action, including the Defend-
ing American Security from Kremlin
Aggression Act, called DASKA, and the
Defending Elections from Threats by
Establishing Redlines Act, the DETER
Act. I would urge the chairmen of
those committees to take up those bills
and send them to the floor, where
Leader MCCONNELL should bring them
up for serious consideration.
Second, we should commit serious—
and I mean serious—resources to elec-
tion security. FBI Director Wray and
other intelligence officials have testi-
fied that 2016 was not an isolated inci-
dent. Foreign powers will try again to
interfere in our elections, they posited,
in 2020 and beyond. Director Wray—and
this should trouble every American—
called 2018 a dress rehearsal for our ad-
versaries. It might not just be Moscow
next time. It could be Beijing, Tehran,
or Pyongyang. If our elections are sus-
ceptible to foreign influence, our de-
mocracy is at risk.
We know—we know right now—that
another foreign influence campaign is
coming, and if we don’t take steps to
secure our elections, it would be aston-
ishingly irresponsible. In fiscal year
2018, we were able to allocate $380 mil-
lion in funding through the appropria-
tions process for States to harden their
election infrastructure and help im-
prove election administration. I
thought this was very important and
pushed hard to get it in that budget,
that appropriation. Unfortunately,
though, in fiscal year 2019, our Repub-
lican colleagues blocked us from allo-
cating more funding to the States, de-
spite overwhelming demand. Why? Why
would Republicans want to not stop
Russia or someone else from inter-
fering in our elections? It is befuddling.
Make no mistake, though, Democrats
will push for more election security
money in the upcoming appropriations
process.
We should also take up the bipartisan
Secure Elections Act. Ranking Member
LEAHY and Ranking Member KLO-
BUCHAR are the leaders on this issue,
and I hope their diligence will pay off
once again.
Third, we must hear from the intel-
ligence and defense community about
the coming threats of 2020. So today I
would like to request that Leader
MCCONNELL—I am officially requesting
him to schedule an all-Senators classi-
fied briefing with the leaders of the De-
partments of Homeland Security, FBI,
and the Cyber Command to inform Sen-
ators about the threat of foreign inter-
ference in the 2020 election cycle. We
must be very aware of these threats
and take immediate steps to avoid the
repeat of 2016.
The Senate can do these three things
quickly, and each one of them should
be bipartisan and noncontroversial.
There are no doubt other ideas and leg-
islation along these lines we should
consider, but this is a place to get
started. I look forward to having dis-
cussions with my colleagues about
these items in the coming days.
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA
Madam President, Leg Graveyard.
Now, on another and related matter,
the three items I just mentioned are
examples of the things that the Senate
could—could—be doing in a bipartisan
way to address a serious challenge. I
hope the Republican leader sees the
value in pursuing them because so far
this year the Republican leader has
shown little interest in pursuing mean-
ingful bipartisan legislation.
With over a year and a half left in
Congress, Leader MCCONNELL has
turned this Chamber into a legislative
graveyard, and without a shred of
irony, he has proudly bragged that he
is the Senate’s Grim Reaper. Is that
what the American people want? They
urge us to work together in a bipar-
tisan way, but Leader MCCONNELL
takes all the bills that have passed the
House, puts them in his drawer, and
spends his time simply doing nomina-
tions.
We are one-quarter of the way
through the year, so let’s do a quick

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2504 April 30, 2019
quarterly review. Our colleagues in the
House have been busy. In 4 months,
over 100 pieces of legislation passed
their Chamber. Here are some of them:
Legislation to oppose the lawsuit that
would eliminate protections for Ameri-
cans with preexisting conditions. Who
is opposed to that? Leader MCCONNELL
is. Legislation to reform our democ-
racy and improve elections, restore
voting rights, and get the money out of
politics; legislation on paycheck fair-
ness so women are treated equally to
men; commonsense background checks
for which 98 percent of Americans sup-
port; upgrades to the Violence Against
Women Act; legislation to restore net
neutrality; and despite the fact that
the President shut down the govern-
ment for over a month, these bills have
passed the House, most every one of
them, with bipartisan support. These
aren’t partisan bills. They are com-
monsense proposals to help the middle
class solve our country’s basic prob-
lems.
The Republican leader told the Amer-
ican people that under his leadership,
the Senate would debate and vote on
issues of the day no matter if his party
supported them. Yet not one, not one
of these bills has come to the floor of
the Senate—not one. Not one has been
debated in the Chamber. These are the
bills. If the Republican leader doesn’t
love every aspect of one of these House
bills, fine, we are not saying take them
or leave them. Let’s have a debate.
Let’s have amendments. At least let’s
try to compromise on language that
can get through both Chambers.
What has the Senate been doing in-
stead? Leader MCCONNELL has wasted
precious time on basically two issues,
‘‘gotcha’’ votes like a stunt on climate
change and Republicans’ cynical at-
tempts to limit women’s reproductive
health choices. The remainder has been
spent on approval of alarmingly un-
qualified nominees to executive agen-
cies in the judiciary.
What are we doing this week on the
calendar? Not one piece of legislation,
just nominees. Next week could prob-
ably be more of the same. So over the
next 2 years, the Republican Senate is
in danger of becoming little more than
a staffing agency to the administra-
tion’s radical nominees. That is a trag-
edy because at the start of this Con-
gress, the American people sent a clear
message. They wanted us to work to-
gether on legislation in a bipartisan
way. The American people voted for ac-
tion: action on healthcare, action on
prescription drugs, action on climate
change, and gun safety. Poll after poll
shows that these issues are on the
minds of Americans. Substantial ma-
jorities, Democrats and Republicans,
supported them. We cannot, simply be-
cause we have a divided government,
allow this entire Congress to go by
without making meaningful progress
on these issues. This is not good for the
country, certainly not good for the
Senate or the Republican Party and
the incumbents in those Chambers. The
American people cannot afford to have
Leader MCCONNELL turn one Chamber
of their government into a legislative
graveyard for 2 full years. We hope he
will realize the folly of this both sub-
stantively and politically, and maybe
we will start doing some real work.
ECONOMIC GROWTH
Madam President, finally, on the
economy, that is one area that de-
serves our attention, although you
wouldn’t guess it if you were listening
to President Trump. President Trump
repeatedly brags about low unemploy-
ment numbers and a rising stock mar-
ket—two trends that actually began
long before he took office. President
Trump should say ‘‘Thanks, Obama’’
for handing him an economy that was
well into recovery from the worst fi-
nancial crisis since the Great Depres-
sion. But what the President has done
since taking office has been to tilt the
playing field to allow most of the bene-
fits of this recovery to flow to those at
the very top. He can brag about GDP
numbers, but when most of the wealth
is going more and more to the highest
level of people, it doesn’t benefit
enough people.
President Trump has consistently
weakened programs that help middle-
class Americans afford healthcare. He
has rolled back critical worker and
consumer protections and rammed
through a tax bill that gave egregious
giveaways to big corporations. Instead
of the wealth trickling down, corpora-
tions have spent the lion’s share of
their new profits on corporate stock
buybacks, which benefit shareholders
and the CEOs—most of them very
wealthy—not average Americans or
workers.
If the economy is so strong, why is it
that 4 out of 10 Americans can’t afford
a $400 emergency expense? Why is it
that income disparity grows, with the
middle class left holding the bag? Re-
cent polls confirm—and this should be
a watch word, Mr. President—Ameri-
cans don’t believe the Trump economy
is working for them. In a recent ABC
poll, most Americans see the Trump
economy as primarily benefiting those
who are already in power, those who
are already wealthy. According to
Monmouth, most Americans say the
economy hasn’t benefited them much,
if at all.
To simply brag about large macro
numbers but not look at the effect on
the average person who is making $40-
, $50-, $60,000 a year—that is wrong.
That is not helping them. The group
who believes the economy is benefit-
ting them the most is making over
$100,000 a year. God bless them, but we
ought to be working to spread eco-
nomic benefits to the middle class.
Despite the President’s trumpeting of
self-selected economic data, the bot-
tom line is this: The Trump economy is
working OK if you are already doing
quite well, but it is not doing enough—
not close to enough—for working
America and the middle class.

NOMINATION OF GORDON HARTOGENSIS
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I
come to the floor to oppose the nomi-
nation of Mr. Gordon Hartogensis to
serve as Director of the Pension Ben-
efit Guaranty Corporation and, really,
to express my continued frustration
with the Republicans’ efforts to
weaponize the nomination process for
partisan gain, including their unprece-
dented refusal to move Democratic
nominees for important Agencies, like
the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission and the National Labor
Relations Board, in order to tilt them
in favor of corporations, and including
their continued attacks on women’s
healthcare and reproductive rights by
stacking our courts with far-right
judges.
The Director of the PBGC is respon-
sible for protecting the retirement se-
curity of almost 40 million people. We
owe it to workers and retirees to make
absolutely sure a nominee for this posi-
tion has the relevant pension-related
experience and knowledge to handle
that challenge. One needs to have the
determination to fight for workers and
retirees and to have the willingness to
work with Members on both sides of
the aisle.
When it comes to Mr. Hartogensis, I
am simply not convinced that this is
the case. It is unclear to me why he
was nominated to replace Director
Reeder, who is doing a commendable
job, well before Director Reeder’s term
was completed. What makes this even
worse is that the Senate HELP Com-
mittee didn’t have a hearing at which
members could question Mr.
Hartogensis.
I have asked the Trump administra-
tion why it decided to replace Mr.
Reeder. No response. My Democratic
colleagues on the committee asked the
chairman for a hearing with Mr.
Hartogensis. No hearing. We should be
giving Mr. Hartogensis’ nomination se-
rious scrutiny, including having a
hearing with the Senate HELP Com-
mittee, especially considering the com-
plex challenges that the PBGC Director
must help the Agency navigate amid
our country’s multiemployer pension
crisis. Millions of workers and retirees
across the country are at risk of seeing
the pensions they were promised—that
they earned and planned their financial
futures around—thrown into jeopardy
through absolutely no fault of their
own.
I am hopeful we can focus on this
issue more going forward, and I look
forward to taking bipartisan steps to
address this crisis, but I am dis-
appointed that our committee, which

should be most focused on this critical
issue, was not even able to have a hear-
ing with Mr. Hartogensis in order to
dive into this crisis more deeply. So,
given my doubts about his credentials
for this position and my frustration
with this nomination process, I will be
voting against this nomination.
Unfortunately, Mr. Hartogensis is
just one example of a broader effort by
the Republicans to play political
games with the nomination process in
ways that, ultimately, harm workers
and families nationwide.
NOMINATIONS
Madam President, I remain deeply
disturbed by the Republicans’ contin-
ued partisanship, particularly their ob-
struction of highly qualified Demo-
cratic nominees for the Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Commission and the
National Labor Relations Board.
It has been a longstanding practice
to respect the minority party’s selec-
tion of nominees and to move majority
and minority nominees together to
independent Agencies. Yet my col-
leagues across the aisle have jammed
through Republican nominees to the
NLRB and have hampered the EEOC’s
work by allowing one Republican Sen-
ator to essentially veto the Democratic
nominee to the Agency, effectively
tilting the playing field even more in
favor of corporations and against work-
ers’ rights.
In this moment, as so many brave
women and men have come forward to
share their stories of workplace harass-
ment and brought this issue to the
forefront and as the Trump administra-
tion continues to undermine workers’
rights to organize and collectively bar-
gain for higher wages and better work-
ing conditions, the EEOC and the
NLRB have very critical roles to play
in protecting workers’ rights. They
have to be able to function fully and
with balanced voices. I am going to
keep fighting for workers across the
country and keep pushing to get Demo-
cratic nominees confirmed to this
Commission and this Board.
NOMINATION OF J. CAMPBELL BARKER
Madam President, the Republicans’
nomination antics, of course, go far be-
yond those important Agencies. The
Republicans are also continuing to
work with President Trump to veer our
courts far right by stacking them with
ideological judges, especially when it
comes to women’s health and reproduc-
tive rights, which brings me to another
nominee before us whom I strongly op-
pose—Mr. John Campbell Barker. As
we have seen with Justice Kavanaugh
and with so many other nominees,
President Trump is seizing every op-
portunity he gets to appoint judges
who will be willing to chip away at the
right to safe, legal abortion. Unfortu-
nately, Mr. Barker fits that pattern to
a tee.
As deputy solicitor general of Texas,
in the Whole Woman’s Health case, he
defended a law that imposed medically
unnecessary requirements on physi-
cians and clinics that were meant to
make it harder for women to access
safe, legal care. He has also made it
clear that he believes employers should
be able to decide whether the women
who work for them can get birth con-
trol through their insurance coverage.
These alarming positions are just a few
of the reasons I oppose Mr. Barker’s
nomination. I urge my colleagues to do
the same.
The Republicans may be determined
to continue their crusade of tipping the
judiciary against women’s health and
reproductive rights, but they should
know that the Democrats and women
and men across the country are just as
determined to stand up, call them out,
and fight back.
I yield the floor.

CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I
am joined on the floor by my colleague
Senator SHELDON WHITEHOUSE, who has
recently visited coastal Louisiana and
will share his observations following
my remarks. He will speak objectively
about that which we in Louisiana see
not only objectively but emotionally.
We see our coastline melting away,
and with the loss of that coastline, in-
creasing vulnerability to hurricanes
coming off the gulf, as well as a loss of
villages, beautiful oak trees as salinity
kills their roots, whole communities,
and ways of life. I shall elaborate be-
cause Louisiana’s coastal erosion im-
pacts local businesses, communities,
and I would say even our entire Nation.
Some of the Nation’s most important
trade, energy, and commercial fishing
assets are associated with South Lou-
isiana. Now, every Senator gets up and
is proud of his or her State, and they
will make statements such as that, but
these statements are objectively true.
By tonnage, 5 of the 25 largest ports
in the country are located in South
Louisiana and along the Mississippi
River. Twenty percent of the Nation’s
waterborne commerce moves through
Louisiana. Approximately, 11,000 ves-
sels use the lower Mississippi annually.
If you think of a map of our country,
from Wyoming to Pennsylvania, that is
the territory of our country drained by
the Mississippi and its tributaries. If
you are shipping goods from Ohio to
South America, most likely you are
sending it down the Mississippi. The
prosperity of the farmer along the Mis-
souri River can depend upon the navi-
gation of the lower Mississippi. It is
truly a nation-impacting resource, but
coastal erosion threatens the flow of
commerce that is essential and vital to
all of these areas.
Approximately, 20 percent of the Na-
tion’s oil supply originates off the
coast of Louisiana, and countless oil-
field service companies are located in
South Louisiana to process that en-
ergy. Companies like Cheniere, Tellu-
rian, Sempra, and others are investing
billions in liquefied natural gas facili-
ties, demonstrating the value of the
United States but of Louisiana, in par-
ticular, in the global LNG market.
By the way, the workers who work in
these rigs or work in these industries
may live in Louisiana, but sometimes
they will live far inland. I saw a map
where somebody commuted from Mon-
tana, coming down by airplane, work-
ing for a month, and then going back
to Montana. So the folks who work in
our energy industry may come from
any part of our country. Coastal ero-
sion puts this energy infrastructure in
jeopardy, threatening our Nation’s en-
ergy security.
Louisiana has the largest commercial
fishing industry in the lower 48, har-
vesting and selling shrimp, crawfish,
crabs, and oysters to restaurants and
grocery stores around the country.
Coastal erosion puts this industry and
the livelihoods of the workers who de-
pend upon it in jeopardy.
For these reasons, among many
more, I fight in Congress to protect the
Louisiana coastline. Senator WHITE-
HOUSE frequently has a floor chart
when speaking on the environmental
issues and says: ‘‘Time to wake up.’’
Everyone in Louisiana is very awak-
ened to this crisis.
Our State has developed its Coastal
Master Plan to help restore and main-
tain our coast. I think Senator WHITE-
HOUSE will refer to that. We may not be
able to save every parcel of land, but it
is imperative that we work to protect
the vulnerable marshland, as we can,
and, in turn, the businesses and com-
munities from the effects that we see
today.
By the way, oftentimes we only hear
about industry and environmental or-
ganizations attacking one another, but
in Louisiana, we found that without
one, the other cannot survive. We have
found that the environmentalists and
the energy industry have a way to co-
exist and to work for the betterment of
the other. One example is that the
State receives revenues from offshore
energy production and other grant pro-
grams to protect and restore our coast-
line. Louisiana’s constitution man-
dates that these dollars go to coastal
restoration, creating a unique partner-
ship where the royalty payments from
the energy industry fund the environ-
mental restoration upon which my
State’s future depends.
Projects funded with this revenue in-
clude the Mid-Barataria and Mid-Bret-
on diversion projects, designed to di-
rect more sediment from the Mis-
sissippi River to rebuild marshland lost
due to coastal erosion, in part because
the Mississippi River was previously
leveed. Other projects seek to protect
vulnerable marshland from further
losses by controlling saltwater intru-
sion in the Houma Navigation Canal or
the Calcasieu River ship channel. How-
ever, more needs to be done to protect
Louisiana’s coastline and the impact
upon the United States’ economic and
energy security.
In a previous Congress, I introduced
legislation in the House and now in the
Senate to amend the Gulf of Mexico
Energy Security Act to provide more
offshore energy revenue to energy-pro-
ducing States in the gulf to fund coast-
al restoration and other environmental
protection projects. Most recently, in
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act bill and in
another bill, there was an increase to
the current cap on GOMESA dollars for
fiscal years 2020 and 2021. I am cur-
rently working on another version of
revenue-sharing legislation for the Gulf
States, which I plan to introduce later
this spring.
As part of that effort, working with
Senator WHITEHOUSE’s staff, we have
been working on legislation to create a
revenue-sharing program with the Fed-
eral and State governments for off-
shore wind to fund coastal resiliency
efforts, an issue important to us and
probably about 80 percent of America’s
population that I roughly judge lives
within 100 miles of the coastline.
I look forward to working with Sen-
ator WHITEHOUSE and other colleagues
to ensure that the coastal restoration
needs important to Louisiana and to
the United States are met. Again, I so
appreciate Senator WHITEHOUSE’s com-
ing to visit and learn more about
coastal Louisiana. I look forward to
working with him on our mutual inter-
ests to protect our environment and
our communities.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I am very grateful to be joined by
the senior Senator from Louisiana on
the floor today. I think this is about
240 in my series of ‘‘Time to Wake Up’’
speeches, and this is the first time we
have a bipartisan presentation on the
floor, which is significant to me.
I had the great pleasure of visiting
Louisiana last month to see firsthand
how a combination of decreased sedi-
mentation, erosion, subsidence, habitat
degradation, and rising seas are threat-
ening Louisiana’s coastline. I was
joined by Congressman GARRET
GRAVES, former Louisiana Coastal Pro-
tection and Restoration Authority
chairman, and I thank the Congress-
man for sharing his time and expertise
of Louisiana’s coastal issues. I have
also enjoyed working with Louisiana’s
junior Senator on coastal resiliency ef-
forts, and I look forward to continuing
that work.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2507
April 30, 2019
Senator CASSIDY and I share home
States that are lively, diverse, coastal,
proud, and a little bit eccentric and
that have great food. There is a lot in
common between Louisiana and Rhode
Island. Like Rhode Island, Louisiana’s
coast drives the State’s economy and
has shaped the State’s history and cul-
ture. Coastal Louisiana is home to
around 2 million people and is respon-
sible for over a quarter of the conti-
nental United States’ fisheries land-
ings. According to the U.S. Geological
Survey, Louisiana’s wetlands today
represent about 40 percent of the wet-
lands of the continental United States
and about 80 percent of the losses.
Coastal wetlands are critical habitat
and nurseries for commercially impor-
tant fisheries and other wildlife. They
also improve coastal water quality and
buffer against storm surge, flooding,
and other storm effects. Across the
United States, we have lost ground.
About half of our original wetlands in
the past 200 years are gone. That is sig-
nificant, and the scale and speed of
wetland loss in coastal Louisiana is al-
most impossible to comprehend. From
1932 until 2010, the State lost nearly
1,900 square miles, or 25 percent, of its
coastal land. All the red is land lost
from 1932 to 2010. Between 1985 and 2010,
the State was losing ground, about a
football field’s worth, every hour. Hur-
ricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav, and Ike
caused the loss of more than 300 square
miles of wetlands.
I saw firsthand what Louisiana’s
shredded coastline looks like from the
air. The Mississippi River is one of the
most heavily managed rivers in the
world and is certainly one of the most
important rivers in the world. A com-
bination of flood prevention and irriga-
tion interventions upriver have cut off
the tap of sediment that used to flow
naturally to Louisiana’s wetlands. Now
erosion outpaces natural rebuilding.
Though erosion is a natural phe-
nomenon, oil and gas development ex-
acerbates the problem. The dredged
tracks left in the marsh by exploration
and pipelines accelerate erosion, and
here you see photos we took from our
little airplane of some of those dredged
channels. Strong storms, ratcheting up
in strength on warmer ocean waters,
thanks to climate change, also take a
heavy toll on these vulnerable
marshes, and you can see how these
have been just washed out by the sea
down here as well, again, looking out
from our little aircraft.
Thank you, by the way, to
SouthWings for sharing their aircraft
with us so we could fly and see this.
On top of sediment loss, the Lou-
isiana coastline is also sinking at
around one-third of an inch each year
due to the natural movement of the
Earth’s surface, and oil and gas devel-
opment probably accelerates that proc-
ess.
Then, there is sea level rise. Louisi-
ana’s Coastal Planning and Restora-
tion Authority estimates as much as
2.7 feet of sea level rise by 2050. Tulane
University researchers concluded that
current sea level rise estimates for
Louisiana are actually probably too
conservative, as the tide gauges used to
track sea level rise don’t accurately
account for the fact that coastal
marshes are sinking at the same time.
So these current sea level rise projec-
tions don’t fully express what the rel-
ative sea level rise is expected to be.
Following Hurricanes Katrina and
Rita, Louisiana undertook the
daunting task of assembling a Coastal
Master Plan. This 50-year, $50 billion
plan identifies 124 projects aimed at
maintaining 800 square miles of land
over time. Experts there hope to reduce
over $150 billion in damage by 2067
through a combination of hard infra-
structure, restoring shoreline and bar-
rier islands, diverting sediment, and
protecting structures by doing things
like flood-proofing and elevating them.
The Coastal Protection and Restora-
tion Authority, which led the develop-
ment of this master plan, looked at
three potential scenarios for the next
50 years. It considered changes in pre-
cipitation, sea level rise, subsidence,
and storm frequency and intensity.
We will look at the medium scenario.
Under the medium scenario, the Coast-
al Authority expects more precipita-
tion, over 2 feet of sea level rise,
stronger though less frequent storms,
and a continued slowing of subsidence.
The agency then modeled what the
coastline would look like 50 years out
under these medium conditions with
and without this $50 billion invest-
ment. Without the $50 billion invest-
ment, all that is red is lost to the sea.
With the investment, there is still a lot
of red lost, but these green areas show
areas that are saved, and if you live in
one of these green areas, hunt in one of
these green areas, and have a business
in one of these green areas, it is pretty
darn important to you to see that they
are saved.
Louisiana is at a point of no return,
where the forward march of sea level
rise and stronger storms will continue
to erode the State’s shore. Although
Louisianians are faced with this dis-
couraging future, I was very impressed
by the optimism of the Louisianians I
met. I spoke with Governor John Bel
Edwards, with CPRA Chairman Chip
Kline, CPRA Director Bren Haase, and
Deputy for Coastal Activities Megan
Terrell and had dinner together with
many of them and Senator CASSIDY to
discuss implementation of this Coastal
Master Plan.
The Governor, who has said that ‘‘cli-
mate change is real; I do not deny it,’’
is committed to implementing the
Coastal Master Plan. The price tag is
hefty, but the potential losses to Lou-
isiana are much greater. I also went to
Baton Rouge and met with Mayor-
President Sharon Weston Broome.
While I was there in Baton Rouge, the
Mississippi was steadily climbing the
levees that protect the city. These are
the handrails for the steps down to the
Mississippi River, and, as you can see,
it was high enough that it was not only
over the steps but over the handrails.
By March 21 of this year, the number
of days at or above flood stage in Baton
Rouge was on track to set new records.
The mayor pointed out that getting
the help communities need to prepare
for severe but unnamed storms can be
difficult, which is why I so appreciate
working with Senator CASSIDY on ways
to improve our response to coastal re-
silience, both of ours being Coastal
States.
Following the release of the fifth Na-
tional Climate Assessment back in No-
vember, Mayor-President Broome said:
After the 1,000-year rain event of 2016 in
my city, I have been paying close attention
to credible projections for future events. . . .
the combined impacts of sea level rise and
storm surge in the southeast have the poten-
tial to cost up to $60 billion each year in 2050
and up to $99 billion in 2090; that level of im-
pact cannot be dismissed or put off for the
next generation to deal with.
Baton Rouge is home to Louisiana
State University, the LSU Tigers, and
the impressive Center for River Stud-
ies. This is the main room at the Cen-
ter for River Studies. This is an enor-
mous physical model of the Mississippi
River through which actual water runs
and through which they can put small,
sort of simulated sediment to model
sediment flow, and these projectors on
the roof can project down onto the sur-
face to show various models and to pro-
vide all this color. So that is actually
like a flat movie screen with projectors
on the surface, which is three-dimen-
sional in the sense that they built a
model of the Mississippi River through
it. It is an amazing educational tool,
and it lets researchers at LSU and at
the Army Corps of Engineers and oth-
ers better understand the sediment dy-
namics in the Mississippi River.
I ask unanimous consent to have
printed in the RECORD a terrific article
by the legendary Louisiana Pulitzer
prize-winning outdoor columnist Bob
Marshall.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
[Apr. 7, 2019]
OUR COAST ISN’T DISAPPEARING OR
VANISHING; IT’S BEING VIOLENTLY DESTROYED
(By Bob Marshall)
Today’s tip for Louisiana’s coastal sur-
vival: Ban the terms ‘‘vanishing’’ and ‘‘dis-
appearing’’ from being used in connection
with the words ‘‘Louisiana coast.’’
You see, in the world of addiction recov-
ery, practitioners know words are important.
Until the addict admits to having a problem,
they will never find a cure.
For example, the abuser who says, ‘‘I just
get a little high now and then’’ will never
kick the habit until he says, ‘‘I am an ad-
dict.’’
So it has occurred to me one of the reasons
for the inability of Louisiana residents and
politicians to take some necessary steps to
save what’s left of our coast is that we’ve
been taught to use gentle euphemisms for a
major cause of our demise: We say our wet-
lands and coast have been ‘‘vanishing’’ or
‘‘disappearing.’’
Nothing could be further from the truth.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2508 April 30, 2019
Those descriptions evoke a gentle passage,
a slow, almost comforting process of fading
into history. And the term ‘‘lost coast’’ is
equally off target. It’s like saying we mis-
placed a treasured item, or it was taken by
an act of God.
None of those gentle things caused 2,000
square miles of marsh, swamp and uplands to
become open water since the 1930s.
They were destroyed. By us.
And anyone who has spent time on the wet
side of our levees—or has driven across the
wetlands on elevated roadways—could see it
wasn’t a gentle act.
This was a brutal assault, a battery, a vi-
cious mugging. We used machines to dig up
and toss aside marshes and cypress tupelo
swamps to turn more than 10,000 miles (at
last count) of our coastal zone into canals
for barges to float drilling rigs, to lay tens of
thousands of miles of pipelines for oil and
gas, and to carve out shipping channels to
make it easier and faster for boats to assist
in the destruction. This was no gentle, whis-
pering vanishing act; it was a noisy, diesel-
fumed mauling of a pristine ecosystem we
claim to love.
It was as violent and ugly to our homeland
as the way companies eviscerated Western
desert landscapes to strip mine for copper, or
the way others dynamited entire Appa-
lachian mountaintops—throwing their waste
into adjacent streams—to make it easiest to
harvest coal profits.
No one in Nevada or West Virginia says
those deserts and mountains ‘‘disappeared’’
or ‘‘vanished.’’ They admit they were will-
fully destroyed.
Our ongoing embrace of these misleading
euphemisms for what we did hides an even
uglier aspect of this disaster: our silence. In
many ways, this has been the Kitty Genovese
of environmental crimes—because most of us
stood by and did nothing even as the crime
was being committed in front of us, then just
walked silently away. We chose not to get
involved because we were told it could cost
us money.
Yes, levees on the rivers presaged the
crimes, but those were unavoidable if we in-
tended to live here. And 36 to 60 percent of
what was destroyed—the portion researchers
tie to oil and gas work—might still be here
today if we had chosen another way.
Maybe we didn’t truly understand the sys-
temic damage we were doing until the 1960s.
But even then—even when the crime reports
came out and the perpetrators were identi-
fied—we chose to look the other way.
Worse, we have taught the rest of the na-
tion to join us in that deception. Google
‘‘Louisiana coast and disappearing,’’ and
you’ll get 3.1 million hits. We have been so
successful in this dissembling that our denial
is now repeated regularly by journalists. The
latest example is an in-depth New Yorker
piece entitled ‘‘Louisiana’s Disappearing
Coast’’—which gave one sentence to the im-
pact of those 10,000 miles of canals.
Indeed, our penchant for avoiding responsi-
bility for our self-destruction extends to
other another crime against our landscape
and our children’s futures. Many of our poli-
ticians and residents now are ignoring or de-
nying the mugging of the atmosphere by the
emissions many of us help produce, emis-
sions that are pushing the sea level rise ac-
celeration that will send us to even earlier
watery grave.
The only way to kick this deadly habit is
to finally admit we have a problem.
So, let’s take the first step. Let’s look in
the mirror and say to the people we see star-
ing back that our coast isn’t disappearing or
vanishing. It has been, and continues to be,
willfully destroyed by our inaction—and we
have no future here unless we kick that
habit.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, after Baton Rouge, I went to the
legendary city of New Orleans where I
met with Mayor LaToya Cantrell.
Around half of that city lives below sea
level. Strong partnerships between the
public and private sectors help make
the city a national leader in resiliency
planning.
In 2017, the city’s ‘‘Climate Action
for a Resilient New Orleans’’ plan
pledged to cut greenhouse gas emis-
sions by 50 percent by 2030. In March,
New Orleans sued 11 oil, gas, and pipe-
line companies for damage to the wet-
lands that protect the city from storm
surge and flooding.
Mayor Cantrell spoke to me about
‘‘learning to live with water’’ in the
post-Katrina city. I visited community
leaders in the recovering Lower Ninth
Ward who are turning wetlands res-
toration projects in the area into edu-
cation, community engagement, tour-
ism, and other opportunities to rebuild
a healthy connection between the city
and the water that surrounds it.
I also met with a number of commu-
nity leaders to discuss how businesses,
nonprofits, researchers, and govern-
ment agencies work together to save
Louisiana’s working coastline. I heard
from a business owner about a property
he was having difficulty insuring due
to anticipated flood risks.
I learned about the changes fisher-
men see in the gulf and how some of
them have switched to nontraditional
fisheries or changed careers com-
pletely. Hunters and recreational fish-
ermen also notice worrying changes in
their sportsmen’s paradise.
Though the evidence of climate
change is everywhere in Louisiana and
is reshaping the lives of Louisianans,
the phrase ‘‘climate change’’ still
brings apprehension in some circles.
Let me go back. This is us in the
Ninth Ward, and here we are with some
of the boats down at the fishing pier off
of the Mississippi. I will describe a lit-
tle bit more. This is the inlet that
flows to Davis Pond, and it has brought
water and sediment to the Davis Pond
area.
You can’t see this very clearly, but
these are white pelicans. I had never
seen so many together in my life. It is
rare for a Rhode Islander to see a white
pelican. Here they pile in thick because
the fish get drawn in coming off the
river, and it makes a wonderful chow
line. So there is a big population of
white pelicans that have learned to
show up this time of year and enjoy the
chow line at this particular entry
point.
I do want to say that although there
is some hesitancy in talking about cli-
mate change in some quarters, some
people are not hesitant, and I refer to
the legendary Bob Marshall, who has
described this as the ‘‘mugging of the
atmosphere’’ by our emissions.
Having spoken with resiliency ex-
perts and seen Louisiana by both sky
and in that terrific LSU model, I then
took to the water to visit this restora-
tion work in action. This is Davis Pond
here, and it was conceived as a fresh-
water diversion to push back saltwater
intrusion into the marshes with
counterpressure from added saltwater,
but it turned out that it grew marsh-
land, and it is now teaming with coast-
al wildlife and dozens of different bird
species.
Here we are. We traveled in an air-
boat to get down there. I also visited
hunter and fisherman Ryan Lambert at
his lodge in Buras. He showed me some
of his personal efforts to restore the
delta and its wetlands. I am out here
on his boat driving around the area
that he has been working, pointing out
how quickly, if you give nature a
chance, she can rebound. A scientist
with the National Wildlife Federation
counted over 30 species of birds just
while we were waiting to board the
boat, and he spotted over 40 species
while we were out on the water.
The sights and sounds of a healthy
marsh were encouraging and a re-
minder of nature’s God-blessed ability
to find a way to not only survive but
flourish, given the chance.
Louisiana faces challenges ahead, but
Louisianans are united in a David
versus Goliath-scale battle to protect
their State. To achieve that goal, I be-
lieve Louisiana must urge its fossil fuel
tenants to accept responsibility for the
climate crisis and commit to being
part of the solution. Louisiana can be
the crucible of compromise between
the environment and the industry.
So thank you to all the wonderful ad-
vocates, researchers and community
and State leaders I met in my visit to
Louisiana. Thank you to Senator CAS-
SIDY for his hospitality to me while I
was down there. The dedication of the
Louisianans I met to their coast is ad-
mirable and inspiring, and Louisiana’s
coastal plan is a model for other coast-
al States.
I would also like to thank the senior
Senator from Louisiana for welcoming
me the way he did and for joining me
here today. This is a big moment for
me to have this be the first bipartisan
‘‘Time to Wake Up.’’ We share a com-
mitment to giving our coast the re-
spect, attention, and support they are
due. I look forward to working to-
gether with Senator CASSIDY to find
opportunities for our government to
play its role in supporting our coastal
resiliency and restoration.
Thank you, my friend.
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO SANDY HART
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
every American has the solemn respon-
sibility to show our gratitude to the
brave men and women who have an-
swered the call to serve our Nation in
uniform. We have an obligation to
honor the values for which they fought
and praise their efforts to preserve the
freedom of this great country and the
world.
This year marks the 75th anniversary
of the Allied invasion of the beaches of
Normandy on D-Day. With every step
onto the European continent, the
forces of freedom moved closer to end-
ing the reign of tyranny. Kentucky’s
World War II veteran community also
marks another important milestone
this year. Fifteen years ago, Sandy
Hart, of Wickliffe, organized a
groundbreaking project to honor the
service of Kentucky’s veterans. Be-
cause of Sandy’s remarkable leader-
ship, more than 500 World War II vet-
erans traveled to our Nation’s Capital
in 2004 to visit the new memorial dedi-
cated in their honor.
It is my privilege to recognize Sandy
for her many years of dedicated service
to American veterans, whom she calls
true heroes. For many of the members
of the Greatest Generation, a visit to
the World War II Memorial in Wash-
ington, DC, simply wouldn’t have been
possible without her. Through more
than a year and a half of hard work,
Sandy, the daughter of a World War II
veteran, collected the necessary dona-
tions to fill 17 busloads and give every
veteran the chance to visit their me-
morial free of charge. Although shy by
nature, she is animated by her passion
for honoring veterans.
To foster greater understanding and
appreciation of the sacrifice veterans
made for this county, Sandy and her
husband Ray established the Kentucky
Veteran and Patriot Museum. With do-
nations of both funds and memorabilia,
Sandy hopes the museum can be a
meaningful place of engagement and
remembrance both for current veterans
and for future generations. With fo-
cuses on each of the modern American
military engagements, Sandy’s mu-
seum pays tribute to the heroes who
defended our Nation.
I am not the only one who admires
Sandy for her tireless work in Ken-
tucky. In his series of books entitled
‘‘Kentucky’s Everyday Heroes: Ordi-
nary People Doing Extraordinary
Things,’’ Steve Flairty profiled inspira-
tional men and women throughout the
Commonwealth who, in his words, ‘‘go
quietly about their daily living, mak-
ing others’ lives better, with little or
no thoughts of personal benefit.’’
Sandy’s remarkable servant leadership
clearly belongs among the ranks of
these Kentuckians. Her inclusion in
the book is a well-earned tribute to her
lifetime spent in service to others.
To celebrate the 15th anniversary,
the Wickliffe community will host a
parade and a ceremony. They will also
unveil new memorials to brave Amer-
ican veterans. This anniversary gath-
ering is the latest opportunity for Ken-
tuckians to honor our heroes that
would be impossible without Sandy’s
committed vision. I am sure she would
try to avoid the praise I am offering,
but she deserves this and so much
more. Sandy is an inspirational woman
who has dedicated her life to the ben-
efit of those around her, especially our
veterans. So I hope my Senate col-
leagues will join me in marking this
important anniversary and in thanking
Sandy Hart for her extraordinary lead-
ership honoring America’s heroes.

VACCINES
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President,
I ask unanimous consent that a copy of
my opening statement at the Senate
Health Education, Labor, and Pensions
Committee be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
VACCINES SAVE LIVES
Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senate Committee
on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions
will please come to order.
Senator Murray and I will each have an
opening statement, and then we will intro-
duce the witnesses. After the witnesses’ tes-
timony, senators will each have 5 minutes of
questions.
It was not that long ago that, as a boy, I
remember the terror in the hearts of parents
that their children might contract polio and
my classmates in iron lungs.
The Majority Leader, Senator McConnell,
contracted polio when he was young. His
mother took him to Warm Springs, because
that is where President Roosevelt received
treatment for polio. Fortunately, because of
her dedication, Leader McConnell is able to
walk today, but thousands of others were not
as lucky.
Following the introduction of a vaccine in
1955, polio was eliminated in the United
States in 1979, and since then, from every
country in the world except for three. Polio
is just one of the diseases we have eradicated
in the United States thanks to vaccines.
Before the vaccine for measles was devel-
oped, up to four million Americans each year
contracted the highly contagious, airborne
virus.
In 2000, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) declared measles elimi-
nated from the United States. And in 1980,
smallpox was declared eradicated from the
world by the CDC and the World Health Or-
ganization (WHO).
This is a remarkable demonstration of
modern medicine.
Four years ago, this Committee held a
hearing on vaccines, following the 2014 out-
break of measles—the worst outbreak since
the disease was declared eliminated in 2000.
And even though 91.1 percent of Americans
had been vaccinated for measles in 2017, ac-
cording to the CDC, we continue to see out-
breaks of this preventable disease because
there are pockets in the United States that
have low vaccination rates.
Last year, there were 372 cases of mea-
sles—the second highest number since 2000.
And so far this year, there have been 159
cases reported and outbreaks confirmed in
Washington State, New York, Texas, and Il-
linois.
We know that some Americans are hesi-
tant about vaccines, so today I want to
stress the importance of vaccines: not only
has the Food and Drug Administration found
them to be safe, but vaccines also save lives.
Vaccines have been so successful that,
until recently, Americans have lived without
fear of getting measles, polio, or rubella. We
have made significant strides in improving
vaccination rates.
In 2009, about 44 percent of Americans had
received vaccines for seven preventable dis-
eases: Diphtheria], Tetanus, Pertussis, Polio,
Measles, Mumps, and Rubella, Haemophilus
influenza type b, Hepatitis B, Chickenpox,
and Pneumococcal, according to the CDC.
Today, over 70 percent of Americans are
vaccinated against all seven of these dis-
eases.
Vaccines protect not only those who have
been vaccinated, but the larger community.
This is called herd immunity.
There are some people who cannot be vac-
cinated—they are too young, or have a weak
immune system because of a genetic disorder
or are taking medicine that compromises
their immune system, like cancer treatment.
Vaccines protect those who cannot be vac-
cinated by preventing the spread of diseases.
However, low immunization rates can de-
stroy a community’s herd immunity.
While the overall vaccination rate nation-
wide is high enough to create this herd im-
munity, certain areas—the pockets of the
country where vaccination rates are low—
are vulnerable to outbreaks. There is a lot of
misleading and incorrect information about
vaccines that circulates online, including
through social media.
Here is what I want parents in Tennessee,
in Washington, in Texas, everywhere in our
country to know: Vaccines are approved by
the Food and Drug Administration, and meet
the FDA’s gold standard of safety. The Advi-
sory Committee on Immunization Practices
makes recommendations on the use of vac-
cines in the United States and annual child
and adult vaccine schedules. This Advisory
Committee is made up of medical doctors
and public health professionals from medical
schools, hospitals, and professional medical
organizations from around the country. They
are among the best our country has to offer
and they have dedicated their lives to help-
ing others. These recommendations are re-
viewed and approved by the CDC director,
and are available on the CDC’s website.
There is nothing secret about any of this
science. Countless studies have been done to
show that vaccines are safe. Charlatans and
internet fraudsters who claim that vaccines
aren’t safe are preying on the unfounded
fears and daily struggles of parents, and they
are creating a public health hazard that is
entirely preventable.
It is important for those who have ques-
tions about vaccines, especially parents, to
speak with a reputable health care provider.
As with many topics, just because you found
it on the internet doesn’t make it true.
The science is sound: Vaccines save lives—
the lives of those who receive vaccines and
the lives of those who are too young or vul-
nerable to be immunized.
Before I turn this over to Senator Murray,
I want to add that the National Childhood

THE OPIOID CRISIS
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President,
I ask unanimous consent that a copy of
my opening statement at the Senate
Health Education, Labor, and Pensions
Committee be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
MANAGING PAIN DURING THE OPIOID CRISIS
Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senate Committee
on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions
will please come to order. Senator Murray
and I will each have an opening statement,
and then we will introduce the witnesses.
After the witnesses’ testimony, senators will
each have 5 minutes of questions.
Dan, a constituent of mine who lives in
Maryville, Tennessee, recently wrote me
about his wife, who has a rare disease that
causes her chronic pain. Dan is concerned be-
cause it has become more difficult for her to
access painkillers. Dan wrote, ‘‘She is not an
abuser, and is doing everything right. Now
it’s harder for her to get the medicine she
needs.’’
Dan’s wife is one out of 100 million Ameri-
cans who, according to a 2011 report by what
was then the Institute of Medicine, now the
National Academy of Medicine, are living
with some pain—that is about 30 percent of
Americans. 25 million of those have mod-
erate or severe pain.
A new report released in 2018, from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
says that about 50 million Americans have
chronic pain, and nearly 20 million of those
Americans have high-impact chronic pain.
Here is the reality: we are engaged in a
massive effort to make dramatic reductions
in the supply and use of opioids—the most ef-
fective painkiller we have. But on the theory
that every action has an unintended con-
sequence, we want to make sure that as we
deal with the opioid crisis, we keep in mind
those people that are hurting.
We are holding this hearing to better un-
derstand the causes of pain, how we can im-
prove care for patients with pain, and where
we are on developing new medicines and
ways to treat pain.
We know that pain is one of the most fre-
quent reasons people see a doctor, and, ac-
cording to the Mayo Clinic, the number of
adults in the United States with pain is
higher than the number of people with diabe-
tes, heart disease, and cancer combined.
These Americans need more effective ways
than opioids or other addictive painkillers to
manage pain. Opioids, which are commonly
used to treat pain, can lead to addiction and
overdose. More than 70,000 Americans died
from drug overdoses last year, including pre-
scription opioids, making it the biggest pub-
lic health crisis in our country.
Last year, Congress passed comprehensive
opioid legislation to combat this crisis,
which President Trump called ‘‘the single
largest bill to combat a drug crisis in the
history of our country.’’
Our legislation included more than 70 ideas
from 72 Senators, and eight committees in
the House and five Committees in the Senate
that included: Reauthorizing training pro-
grams for doctors and nurses who prescribe
treatments for pain; increasing access to be-
havioral and mental health providers; and
encouraging the use of blister packs for
opioids, such as a 3 or 7-day supply, and safe
ways of disposing unused drugs.
We also took steps to ensure our new law
wouldn’t make life harder for patients with
pain, but now we need to take the next step
to try to find new ways to help them: first—
we gave the National Institutes of Health
more flexibility and authority to spur re-
search and development of new non-addictive
painkillers. We also asked the Food and Drug
Administration to provide guidance for those
developing new non-addictive painkillers to
help get them to patients more quickly. I’m
pleased to see Commissioner Gottlieb’s an-
nouncement this morning that the agency is
developing new guidances on how FDA evalu-
ates the risks and the benefits of new opioid
treatments for patients with pain and to
help the development of non-opioid treat-
ments for pain.
Sam Quinones, a witness at one of our
hearings, called new non-addictive pain-
killers the ‘‘holy grail’’ to solving the opioid
crisis. We have backed up those new authori-
ties with substantial funding—most recently
$500 million to help the National Institutes
of Health find a new nonaddictive painkiller.
Second, we included provisions to encour-
age new pain management strategies, such
as physical therapy. Third, the new law re-
quires experts to study chronic pain and re-
port to the Director of the NIH how patients
can better manage their pain. And fourth,
the new law requires the Secretary of Health
and Human Services to report the impact on
pain patients that Federal and State laws
and regulations that limit the length, quan-
tity, or dosage of opioid prescriptions.
Now that we have started to turn the train
around and head in a different direction on
the use of opioids, everyone—doctors, nurses,
insurers, and patients—will need to think
about the different ways we should treat and
manage pain. There are other things the fed-
eral government is doing to better under-
stand what causes pain and how we treat and
manage it.
For example, the National Pain Strategy,
developed by the Interagency Pain Research
Coordinating Committee, which develops
recommendations to prevent, treat, manage,
and research pain. Through the National In-
stitute on Drug Abuse and the National In-
stitutes of Health’s HEAL Initiative, re-
searchers are working to better understand
pain and why some people experience it dif-
ferently than others. This will help us find
more ways to more effectively treat pain and
help get people the treatment they need.
For example—physical therapy or exercise
may be the best course of treatment for
some kinds of back pain. It may also help us
understand why some people can take
opioids to manage their pain for years with-
out becoming addicted, while others more
easily become addicted.
Today, I hope to hear about how close are
we to having a non-addictive painkiller, and
how doctors and nurses can better treat peo-
ple with pain.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM
ARMSTRONG
∑ Ms. ERNST. Madam President, today
I wish to honor Mr. William ‘‘Bill’’
Armstrong of Mount Ayr, IA. Bill is a
lifelong Iowan and outgoing president
of the Iowa Funeral Directors Associa-
tion.
Bill Armstrong has served as one of
the most effective advocates for both
Iowa morticians and morticians across
the country for almost 40 years. He
graduated from Dallas Institute of
Mortuary Science in 1984 and soon
after moved to his current hometown
of Mount Ayr, where he accepted a po-
sition as a funeral director at Wilson-
Watson Funeral Home. His journey was
only just beginning.
In remarkably short order, he
achieved partnership at the funeral
home and ultimately acquired the busi-
ness from Jay and Donna Watson in
2009, officially making the funeral
home, Armstrong Funeral Homes.
This prompted Bill to become an out-
spoken leader for current and future
funeral professionals. He proudly rep-
resented morticians on both the local
and national level by pioneering an-
nual trips to both Des Moines and to
Washington, DC, in order to raise
awareness about the profession.
Bill was always forward looking,
with a singular objective of training
the next generation of funeral home
leaders. He worked with the University
of Northern Iowa to establish a 4-year
degree program for mortuary studies.
These are all amazing accomplish-
ments, and I want to thank Bill again
for his service and for helping Iowans
through their most difficult life mo-
ments. I wish him success in his new
endeavors.∑

RECOGNIZING BBQGUYS
∑ Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as
a member of the U.S. Senate Com-
mittee on Small Business and Entre-
preneurship, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize a veteran-owned Louisiana
small business that has not only grown
and succeeded but has also steadfastly
remained dedicated to their customers,
employees, and community. This week,
it is my honor to name BBQGuys of
Baton Rouge, LA as the Senate Small
Business of the Week.
In 1998, Mike Hackley began what has
been an American entrepreneurial suc-
cess story. After serving over 10 years
in the U.S. Air Force and working in
the real estate and retail sectors, Mike
followed his passion of outdoor living
and started his own business, opening a
retail location called The Grill Store &
More. Recognizing the potential that e-
commerce had early on, he founded
bbqguys.com in 2001. He started out
with single-digit employees. Today,
BBQGuys has grown to become one of
the largest outdoor living online retail-
ers in the world, employing nearly 300.
With the success of the retail oper-
ations, Mike continued growing his
business, founding Blaze Grill, and
began to design and manufacture pre-
mium barbecue grills with manufac-
turing operations in the United States.
In just a few years, Blaze is already one
of the top grill manufacturers in the
market.

cess, Mike continues to prioritize his

employees, making an effort to say
good morning every day to team mem-
bers and maintaining an open-door pol-
icy for all. Mike believes in treating
his employees like family—a belief he
extends to his customers. This culture
of hospitality has ultimately resulted
in high employee retention and a rep-
utation for outstanding customer serv-
ice. BBQGuys has been named as one of
the Best Places to Work several times
by the Greater Baton Rouge Business
Report and achieved an A+ rating from
the Better Business Bureau. BBQGuys
has also been named one of the 5,000
Fastest Growing Businesses in the U.S.
by Inc. Magazine for 11 consecutive
years. BBQGuys is also involved in the
Baton Rouge community, participating
in several local community activities
including Toys for Tots, the Youth
Oasis Children’s Center, LifeShare
Blood Center, and Friends of the Ani-
mals of Baton Rouge.
BBQGuys is a true representation of
the American dream—following a pas-
sion, committing to hard work, treat-
ing people—customers and employees—
with the utmost respect, and growing a
very small business of single-digit em-
ployees into a leading global business
that is constantly innovating. It is my
distinct pleasure to honor Mike and
the entire team at BBQGuys as the
U.S. Senate Small Business of the
Week. I commend them for their serv-
ice to the Baton Rouge community and
look forward to watching their contin-
ued growth and success. BBQGuys, you
make Louisiana proud.∑

175TH ANNIVERSARY OF OLIVET
COLLEGE
∑ Ms. STABENOW. Madam President,
today I wish to pay special tribute to
Olivet College in Eaton County, which
this year is celebrating 175 years of
educating the people of Michigan.
Let’s think back to 1844. Michigan
had been a State for only 7 years. The
very first women’s rights convention at
Seneca Falls in New York was still 4
years away, and it would be another 19
years before President Lincoln would
sign the Emancipation Proclamation.
It was an era marked by gender and
racial inequality; yet a group of leaders
led by ‘‘Father’’ John J. Shipherd had
a different vision: a college founded on
the values of inclusion, mutual respect,
honesty, and integrity, a Christian in-
stitution where neither gender, nor
race, nor lack of financial resources
would prevent people from attaining an
education.
This was a radical idea. Coeduca-
tion—women and men learning along-
side one another in the same class-
rooms—was rare at the time, so was
admitting Black students alongside
White students and poor students
alongside the affluent.
It was so controversial, in fact, that
Olivet College wasn’t formally char-
tered by the State until 1859. Then in
1863, in the midst of the Civil War, the
college honored its first graduating
class: Mary N. Barber, Sara Benedict,
and Sophia A. Keys.
One hundred seventy-five years later,
a lot has changed, but Olivet College’s
core values remain the same.
Those values include diversity. Com-
ets come from all across Michigan and
the United States and nine other na-
tions around the world. Half are the
first person in their families to go to
college, and half come from low-income
families. About 1 in 3 Comets are stu-
dents of color.
Those values include inclusivity.
That is a special focus of the Olivet
College Women’s Leadership Institute,
which helps young women from middle
school through college recognize and
cultivate their unique strengths and
abilities and become Michigan’s and
America’s next generation of leaders.
Those values include community.
Comets aren’t just responsible for their
own education. Whether they are shar-
ing perspectives in the classroom,
working together to score a goal on the
soccer field, or combining their voices
in the Olivet College Gospel Choir, stu-
dents are committed to the growth of
others.
Those values include service; 100 per-
cent of Comets take part in service
learning, where students use what they
have learned in the classroom to solve
real-life problems both in the commu-
nity and around the world. Just as it
did in 1844, Olivet College understands
that the future of humanity rests in
the hands, hearts, and minds of those
who will accept responsibility for
themselves and others.
The founders of Olivet College once
wrote this: ‘‘We wish simply to do good
to our students, by placing in their
hands the means of intellectual, moral
and spiritual improvement, and to
teach them the divine art and science
of doing good to others.’’
Doing good to others—since 1844, Oli-
vet College has been doing just that.
Congratulations to students, faculty,
staff, and alumni on your first 175
years.
Thank you.∑

S. 1246. A bill to extend the protec-
tions of the Fair Housing Act to per-
sons suffering discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation or gender
identity, and for other purposes; to the
Committee on the Judiciary.
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise
today to re-introduce the Fair and
Equal Housing Act of 2019, legislation
to ensure equal housing opportunities
for all Americans. This bipartisan bill
would protect Americans from housing
discrimination based on gender iden-
tity and sexual orientation. No Amer-
ican should be turned away from a
home they love because of who they
love.

CORRECTION
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2520 April 30, 2019
I began my career as a civil rights at-
torney. My initial focus was on fair
housing, and I learned early on that a
home is more than just structure or a
shelter. A home plays an integral role
in one’s identity, and it is central to
the life of every American.
Housing discrimination nevertheless
continues to plague many Americans.
And it is a reality for LGBT Americans
because of incomplete protections in
the Fair Housing Act (FHA), the land-
mark Federal housing law.
The FHA prohibits housing discrimi-
nation based on race, color, religion,
national origin, sex, familial status, or
disability. It does not, however, protect
against discrimination based upon sex-
ual orientation or gender. More than 20
states and over 200 localities safeguard
sexual orientation and gender identify
in their housing discrimination laws.
That’s telling. It’s time for the federal
government to do the same.
A study released this month analyzed
national mortgage data from 1990 to
2015. It found that same-sex applicants
were 73 percent more likely to be de-
nied approval for a mortgage than op-
posite-sex couples.
The study also found that same-sex
couples often pay more for their loans
in interest and fees. This despite the
fact that the study found no evidence
that same-sex couples carried a higher
default risk. In fact, the study’s find-
ings suggest that same-sex borrowers
may perform better. The analysis indi-
cated that, on average, same-sex cou-
ples paid 0.2 percent more in interest
and fees, which adds up to as much as
$86 million per year.
These findings confirm the need to
include gender identity and sexual ori-
entation as protected classes under fed-
eral housing laws. Loan decisions
should be based on fundamental eco-
nomic considerations, not race, reli-
gion, sexual orientation or gender.
The job of perfecting our Union is an
ongoing quest requiring continued
stewardship. Our history is replete
with examples of manifest action from
the Bill of Rights, to the 14th Amend-
ment, to the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The Fair and Equal Housing Act of 2019
is one more step in our longer journey
to perfect our Union and to extinguish
discrimination in places which call for
our leadership. I urge my colleagues to
join us in support of this legislation.

Mrs. GILLIBRAND, Mr. SCHATZ,
Mr. VAN HOLLEN, and Ms. BALD-
WIN):

By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself,
Mr. CORNYN, Mr. VAN HOLLEN,
Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Ms. HARRIS,
Ms. KLOBUCHAR, Mr. WYDEN,
and Mr. DURBIN):
S. 1253. A bill to apply requirements
relating to delivery sales of cigarettes
to delivery sales of electronic nicotine
delivery systems, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on the Judici-
ary.
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I
rise in support of the ‘‘Preventing On-
line Sales of E-Cigarettes to Children
Act,’’ which would help address the
concerning rise of electronic cigarette
use among America’s youth.
This common-sense bill would pro-
tect children by requiring online re-
tailers of e-cigarettes to meet the same
standards as those that sell regular
cigarettes and other tobacco products
online.
E-cigarette use among teenagers has
increased dramatically over the past
few years. According to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, ap-
proximately 20 percent of high school
students used electronic cigarettes in
2018. In comparison, only about 1.5 per-
cent of high school students reportedly
used e-cigarettes in 2011.
Even more disturbing, the rise of
teenage use of e-cigarettes appears to
be accelerating. Between 2017 and 2018,
e-cigarettes use among high school-
aged children jumped 78%. Today, e-
cigarettes have become the most com-
monly used tobacco product among
America’s youth. These severe levels of
e-cigarette use by middle and high
school-aged children are staggering.
According to a U.S. Surgeon General
report on e-cigarette use among youth
and young adults, the developing ado-
lescent brain is uniquely sensitive to
nicotine. Studies have also shown that
the development of the brain during
adolescence can be permanently al-
tered by nicotine. As a result, children
exposed to nicotine may be at greater
risk for acting out drug-seeking behav-
iors, experiencing deficits in attention
and cognition, and suffering from mood
disorders. These effects may continue
into adulthood, long after e-cigarette
use has stopped.
Given the effects of nicotine on chil-
dren, it is critical that we close any
legal loopholes that have allowed un-
derage youth to gain access to tobacco,
particularly through e-cigarettes.
Among underage e-cigarette users, 86
percent reported that they obtained
the product from somewhere other
than a retail store. And a recent survey
of adolescent e-cigarette users showed
that 32 percent of them reported pur-
chasing their products online, making
online sales the single largest source of
underage purchases.
Our legislation would build off the
‘‘Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking
Act,’’ which has been a tremendous
success in preventing underage use of
cigarettes. Since it passed, the number
of middle and high school students who
use cigarettes has been nearly cut in
half. We should expand on this success
by requiring e-cigarette retailers to
meet the same requirements as those
that sell regular cigarettes online.
By applying the same safeguards that
have worked with online sales of reg-
ular cigarettes, our bill would ensure
that online e-cigarette sellers are
verifying the age of their customers,
properly labeling packages, and check-
ing identification at delivery.
In addition, our bill requires deliv-
eries of e-cigarettes to comply with
relevant State tobacco taxes and re-
porting requirements, as is currently
required of online sales of regular ciga-
rettes and smokeless tobacco products.
E-cigarette retailers will also need to
register and maintain a record of their
online sales, which will be accessible to
State and Federal law officials. Law
enforcement will be able to identify
and shut down online vendors that are
systematically breaking the law by
marketing their e-cigarette products
to children.
This bill complements efforts by the
Food and Drug Administration, which
has recognized the epidemic of youth e-
cigarette use and proposed a number of
policies meant to prevent underage re-
tail purchases, limit flavors that ap-
peal to children, and enforce age
verifications.
Over the last 50 years, the United
States has made remarkable progress
in reducing the number of Americans
that use tobacco products. However,
the dramatic recent rise of e-cigarette
use among our youth threatens that
progress and requires a strong re-
sponse.
I want to thank Senator CORNYN for
joining me in introducing legislation
on this important issue. I urge my col-
leagues to join us in supporting this
bill to address the epidemic of e-ciga-
rette use among America’s youth.
Thank you Mr. President. I yield the
floor.
By Mr. REED (for himself and
Mr. GRASSLEY):
S. 1256. A bill to promote trans-
parency by permitting the Public Com-
pany Accounting Oversight Board to
allow its disciplinary proceedings to be
open to the public, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Banking,
Housing, and Urban Affairs.
Mr. REED. Mr. President, the PCAOB
Enforcement Transparency Act, which
I reintroduce today with Senator
GRASSLEY, will permit the Public Com-
pany Accounting Oversight Board
(PCAOB) to make public the discipli-
nary proceedings it has brought
against auditors and audit firms earlier
in the process.
More than fifteen years ago, our mar-
kets were victimized by a series of
massive financial reporting frauds, in-
cluding those involving Enron and
WorldCom. In response to this crisis,
the Senate Committee on Banking,
Housing, and Urban Affairs conducted
multiple hearings, which produced con-
sensus on a number of underlying
causes, including weak corporate gov-
ernance, a lack of accountability, and
inadequate oversight of accountants
charged with auditing public compa-
nies’ financial statements.
In a 99 to 0 vote, the Senate passed
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to ad-
dress the structural weaknesses and
faults revealed by the hearings. Among
its many provisions, this law called for
the creation of a strong and inde-
pendent board, the PCAOB, responsible
for overseeing auditors of public com-
panies in order to protect investors
who rely on independent audit reports
on the financial statements of public
companies.
To conduct its duties, the PCAOB,
under the oversight of the U.S. Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission (SEC),
oversees more than 1,800 registered ac-
counting firms, as well as the audit
partners and staff who contribute to a
firm’s work on each audit. The Board’s
ability to begin proceedings that can
determine whether there have been vio-
lations of its auditing standards or
rules of professional practice is an im-
portant component of its oversight.
However, unlike the SEC, the U.S.
Department of Labor, the Federal De-
posit Insurance Corporation, the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commis-
sion, the Financial Industry Regu-
latory Authority, and other oversight
bodies, the Board’s disciplinary pro-
ceedings cannot be made public with-
out consent from the parties involved.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2523
April 30, 2019
Of course, parties subject to discipli-
nary proceedings have no incentive to
consent to publicizing their alleged
wrongdoing and thus these proceedings
typically remain cloaked behind a veil
of secrecy. In addition, the Board can-
not publicize the results of its discipli-
nary proceedings until after the ap-
peals process has been completely ex-
hausted, which can often take several
years.
Concealing PCAOB disciplinary pro-
ceedings from the public creates a lack
of transparency that invites abuse and
undermines the Congressional intent
behind the PCAOB, which was to shine
a bright light on auditing firms and
practices, and to bolster the account-
ability of auditors of public companies
to the investing public.
Over the years, some bad actors have
used this loophole to shield themselves
from public scrutiny and account-
ability. Former PCAOB Chairman
James Doty repeatedly stated in testi-
mony provided to both the Senate and
House of Representatives that the se-
crecy of the proceedings ‘‘has a variety
of unfortunate consequences’’ and that
such secrecy is harmful to investors,
the auditing profession, and the public
at large.
For example, an accounting firm con-
tinued to issue no fewer than 29 addi-
tional audit reports on public compa-
nies without those companies knowing
that it was subject to a PCAOB dis-
ciplinary proceeding. Disturbingly,
these investors and the public company
clients of that audit firm were deprived
of important information about the
proceeding against the firm and the
substance of any violations. There are
other critical reasons why the Board’s
enforcement proceedings should be
open and transparent.
First, the incentive to litigate cases
in order to shield conduct from public
scrutiny as long as possible frustrates
the process and requires both litigants
and the PCAOB to expend needless re-
sources.
Second, agencies such as the SEC
have found that open and transparent
disciplinary proceedings can be valu-
able because they inform peer audit
firms of the type of activity that could
lead to enforcement action by the regu-
lator. In effect, transparent pro-
ceedings can serve as a deterrent to
misconduct because of a perceived in-
crease in the likelihood of ‘‘getting
caught.’’ Accordingly, the audit indus-
try as a whole would also benefit from
timely, public, and non-secret enforce-
ment proceedings.
Our bill will make hearings by the
PCAOB, and all related notices, orders,
and motions, transparent and available
to the public unless otherwise ordered
by the Board. This would more closely
align the PCAOB’s procedures with
those of the SEC for analogous mat-
ters.
Increasing transparency and account-
ability of audit firms subject to PCAOB
disciplinary proceedings bolsters inves-
tor confidence in our financial markets
and better protects companies from
problematic auditors. I hope our col-
leagues will join Senator GRASSLEY and
me in supporting this legislation to en-
hance transparency in the PCAOB’s en-
forcement process.

AND APPROPRIATE INTERVEN-
TION
Ms. BALDWIN (for herself and Mr.
BLUNT) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor,
and Pensions:
S. RES. 175
Whereas sepsis is a medical condition re-
sulting from an immune system response to
an infection;
Whereas the overwhelming response of the
immune system to an infection can rapidly
lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and
death;
Whereas more than 1,700,000 individuals in
the United States develop sepsis each year;
Whereas more than 270,000 individuals in
the United States die from sepsis each year,
which is more than the number of individ-
uals who die from prostate cancer, breast
cancer, and HIV/AIDS combined;
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention estimates that 1 in 3 patients
who die in a hospital have sepsis;
Whereas, according to the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality, sepsis is
the most common diagnosis for inpatient
hospital stays in the United States;
Whereas sepsis is the most expensive con-
dition treated in hospitals in the United
States, costing more than $24,000,000,000 each
year;
Whereas sepsis is the number 1 cause of
hospital readmissions, generating more than
$2,000,000,000 in costs annually;
Whereas more than 80 percent of septic pa-
tients are septic upon admission to the hos-
pital;
Whereas mortality rates from septic shock
increase by up to 8 percent for every hour
that treatment is delayed;
Whereas rapid diagnosis and treatment can
prevent up to 80 percent of fatalities from
sepsis; and
Whereas the combination of early detec-
tion of sepsis and appropriate interventions
can significantly improve the chances of sur-
vival for patients with all types of sepsis:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) is committed to increasing awareness of
sepsis and encouraging the education of pa-
tients, families, health care professionals,
and government agencies on the critical im-
portance of early diagnosis as the key for pa-
tients to survive sepsis; and
(2) supports innovative public-private part-
nerships and the pursuit of innovative fi-
nancing tools, incentives, and other mecha-

Sri Lanka; and
(6) a housing complex in Dematagoda, Sri
Lanka;
Whereas more than 250 people were killed
and more than 500 people were injured in the
attacks;
Whereas the attackers acted in the name
of National Thowheeth Jama’ath (referred to
in this preamble as ‘‘NTJ’’), a local Islamist
group that had previously attacked Buddhist
monks and statues;
Whereas NTJ has ties to global Islamist
terrorist organizations and subscribes to an
intolerant Wahhabi ideology that condones
violence against non-Muslims and fellow
Muslims; and
Whereas the Wall Street Journal has re-
ported that, according to SITE, a terrorist-
monitoring firm, on Tuesday, April 23, 2019,
the Islamic State released a video claiming
responsibility for the attacks, stating that
‘‘the executors of the attack that targeted
citizens of coalition states and Christians in
Sri Lanka two days ago were Islamic State
fighters’’: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) condemns the April 21, 2019, terrorist
attacks in Sri Lanka as—
(A) targeted principally against Christians
because of their faith, on their holy day of
Easter, during their Easter prayers; and
(B) perpetrated by radical Islamist terror-
ists acting in the name of a hateful radical
Islamist ideology;
(2) considers the April 21, 2019, terrorist at-
tacks to be an attack on—
(A) all Christians and members of all faiths
in Sri Lanka and around the world; and
(B) the basic human liberty of freedom of
religion;
(3) stands with the Government of Sri
Lanka in bringing peace and security to the
citizens of Sri Lanka, particularly the reli-
gious communities of Sri Lanka; and
(4) calls on Sri Lanka and all govern-
ments—
(A) to protect the freedom of religion, at
home and abroad; and
(B) to partner with the United States in
advancing security and freedom.

mittee on Health, Education, Labor,
and Pensions:
S. RES. 177
Whereas as many as 2,200,000 individuals in
the United States are chronically infected
with hepatitis B, and as many as 2⁄3 of those
individuals are unaware of the infection;
Whereas hepatitis B is a viral infection of
the liver that is transmitted via infected
blood and other bodily fluids, including
through—
(1) mother-to-child transmission; and
(2) injection drug use;
Whereas individuals with chronic diseases,
such as diabetes, HIV, hepatitis C, and
chronic liver disease, and individuals on
hemodialysis, are at an increased risk for
hepatitis B co-infection;
Whereas there is no cure for hepatitis B,
and individuals with chronic hepatitis B re-
quire lifelong medical care;
Whereas chronic hepatitis B is a common
cause of liver cancer;
Whereas 1 in every 4 individuals with
unmanaged chronic hepatitis B will develop
liver cancer, cirrhosis, or liver failure, with
liver cancer having a 5-year survival rate of
only 18 percent in the United States;
Whereas safe and highly effective vaccines
to protect against hepatitis B are available;
Whereas, in accordance with universal
childhood hepatitis B vaccination rec-
ommendations in the United States, infants
and children in the United States have rou-
tinely been vaccinated against hepatitis B
since the 1990s;
Whereas the hepatitis B vaccine, which is
95 percent effective and was the first
anticancer vaccine to be developed, is pro-
jected to prevent 310,000,000 cases of hepatitis
B worldwide from 1990 to 2020;
Whereas only 25 percent of adults in the
United States are vaccinated against hepa-
titis B;
Whereas the number of reported acute hep-

Whereas, according to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, hepatitis B is
50 to 100 times more infectious than HIV, and
5 to 10 times more infectious than hepatitis
C; and
Whereas there are significant opportuni-
ties, particularly within the setting of the
opioid epidemic, to prevent new hepatitis B
infections, and thereby reduce the incidence
of liver cancer and cirrhosis, through efforts
to—
(1) increase adult hepatitis B vaccination;
and
(2) maintain childhood hepatitis B vaccina-
tion: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) supports the designation of April 30,
2019, as ‘‘National Adult Hepatitis B Vac-
cination Awareness Day’’;
(2) recognizes the importance of providing
support and encouragement—
(A) for all individuals to be tested for hepa-
titis B;
(B) for individuals susceptible to infection
to be vaccinated against hepatitis B; and
(C) for individuals diagnosed with hepatitis
B to be linked to appropriate care; and
(3) in order to reduce the number of new
hepatitis B infections and hepatitis B-re-
lated deaths, encourages a commitment to—
(A) increasing adult hepatitis B vaccina-
tion rates;
(B) maintaining childhood hepatitis B vac-
cination rates; and

Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms.
ERNST, and Mr. GRASSLEY) submitted
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary:
S. RES. 178
Whereas the Senate is committed to the
awareness, prevention, and deterrence of sex-
ual violence affecting individuals in the
United States;
Whereas, according to the Department of
Justice and the Department of Health and
Human Services, an estimated 399,861 indi-
viduals, including victims under 18 years of
age, in the United States experienced sexual
violence during 2017;
Whereas, according to the National Crime
Victimization Survey, between 2007 and 2017,
approximately—
(1) 3,018,600 women were victims of rape
and sexual assault; and
(2) 453,200 men were victims of rape and
sexual assault;
Whereas, according to the 2017 Child Mal-
treatment Report of the Department of
Health and Human Services, in 2017, child
protective services agencies substantiated
58,114 cases of sexual abuse of children under
18 years of age;
Whereas, in fiscal year 2018, the Depart-
ment of Justice reported 9,100 State and
local arrests of individuals charged with on-
line sexual victimization of children under 18
years of age;
Whereas, according to the Rape, Abuse &
Incest National Network (commonly known
as ‘‘RAINN’’), an individual is sexually as-
saulted every 92 seconds in the United
States, but for every 1,000 rapes committed
in the United States, on average only—
(1) 330 rapes are reported to law enforce-
ment agencies;
(2) 59 reported rape cases lead to an arrest;
(3) 10 rape cases are referred for prosecu-
tion;
(4) 6 rape cases lead to a felony conviction;
and
(5) 5 convicted rapists are sentenced to
some form of incarceration;
Whereas, according to the National Crime
Victimization Survey, between 2013 and 2017,
an average of only 33 percent of rapes or sex-
ual assaults in the United States were re-
ported to law enforcement agencies;
Whereas studies have suggested that the
rate at which American Indians and Alaska
Natives experience sexual violence is signifi-
cantly higher than for other populations in
the United States;
Whereas, according to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, nearly 1 in 5
women, or 18.3 percent, and 1 in 71 men, or

some time in their lives;
Whereas, according to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, more than 1⁄2 of
all female rape victims reported being raped
by an intimate partner;

many individuals who serve in the Armed
Forces, and the Department of Defense esti-
mates that approximately 14,900 members of
the Armed Forces experienced some form of
sexual assault during 2016;
Whereas sexual assault does not discrimi-
nate on any basis and can affect any indi-
vidual in the United States;
Whereas sexual violence may take many
forms, including acquaintance, stranger,
spousal, and gang rape, incest, child sexual
abuse, child sexual exploitation, elder sexual
abuse, sexual abuse and exploitation of dis-

consequences for the victim, which may in-
clude post-traumatic stress disorder, sub-
stance abuse, major depression, homeless-
ness, eating disorders, and suicide;
Whereas many sexual assaults are not re-
ported to law enforcement agencies, and
many States have restrictive criminal stat-
utes of limitations, which enable many rap-
ists to evade punishment for their crimes;
Whereas sexual assault survivors suffer
emotional complications long after their
physical scars have healed;
Whereas advances in deoxyribonucleic acid
(commonly known as ‘‘DNA’’) technology
have enabled law enforcement agencies to
identify and prosecute the perpetrators in
tens of thousands of previously unsolved sex-
ual assault cases;
Whereas incarceration of sexual assault
perpetrators can prevent perpetrators from
committing additional crimes;
Whereas national, State, territorial, and
Tribal coalitions, community-based rape cri-
sis centers, and other organizations across
the United States are committed to—
(1) increasing public awareness of sexual
violence and the prevalence of sexual vio-
lence; and
(2) eliminating sexual violence through
prevention and education;
Whereas important partnerships have been
formed among criminal and juvenile justice
agencies, health professionals, public health
workers, educators, first responders, and vic-
tim service providers;

zations across the United States play an im-
portant role in making crisis hotlines and
other services available to survivors of sex-
ual assault;
Whereas free, confidential help is available
to all victims and survivors of sexual assault
through—
(1) the National Sexual Assault Hotline—
(A) by telephone at 800-656-HOPE; and
(B) online at https://hotline.rainn.org;
and
(2) more than 1,000 sexual assault service
providers across the United States;
Whereas the victim service programs of
RAINN, including the National Sexual As-
sault Hotline—
(1) in 2018, helped 267,621 survivors of sexual
assault and their loved ones, which rep-
resented the greatest number of people as-
sisted since the founding of the hotline in
1994; and
(2) continue to receive a record number of
requests for support in 2019;
Whereas the Department of Defense pro-
vides the Safe Helpline hotline, Safe
HelpRoom online chat service, and Safe
Helpline mobile application, each of which
offer support and help to members of the De-
partment of Defense community—
(1) by telephone at 877-995-5247; and
(2) online at https://safehelpline.org;
Whereas individual and collective efforts
reflect the dream of the people of the United
States—
(1) for individuals and organizations to ac-
tively work to prevent all forms of sexual vi-
olence; and
(2) for no victim of sexual assault to be
unserved or feel that there is no path to jus-
tice; and
Whereas April 2019 is recognized as ‘‘Na-
tional Sexual Assault Awareness and Preven-
tion Month’’: Now, therefore, be it

vivors of sexual assault; and

VENEZUELA
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, last
year, I made a visit to Caracas, Ven-
ezuela. It was a surprise that they even
offered me a visa to journey to that
country. In the course of several days,
I saw firsthand what life in Venezuela
was like. It was terrible from every as-
pect—malnutrition, children fainting
in schools, hospitals without the basic
medicines, the return of diseases which
had been eradicated decades before,
people on the street emaciated and
working day in and day out in a run-
away inflation country. At 11:30 at
night, there were queues by ATM ma-
chines where people stood patiently in
line for hours to make the maximum
withdrawal from their savings account,
which was the money they needed the
next day to take the bus to work. It is
a terrible situation.
In the course of that visit, I met with
President Maduro and talked to him di-
rectly about his plans to schedule an
election. It was clear to me this elec-
tion was rigged. He had intimidated
and even jailed his opponents to make
certain that there would be no serious
opposition, and I told him there would
be no credibility in that election. It
wouldn’t be accepted by countries
around the world that he was the le-
gitimate leader of that country. Yet he
persisted and went through with the
election.
During the time that I was there, I
had a chance to meet with some of his
political opponents. His tactics against
these opponents were harsh. Leopoldo
Lopez, a popular opponent, was put
under house arrest for years. I spoke to
him on the telephone and met person-
ally with his wife, who described the
bleak existence he had day to day in
the same house under house arrest by
Maduro.
One evening, we had dinner with op-
position members of the National As-
sembly, and it was held at a secret lo-
cation, upstairs in a darkened room,
because of their fear of retribution by
Maduro and his regime.
These are some pretty brave young
men and women who are part of the op-
position to Maduro. I can recall one of
them saying to me: If you come back
next year, out of the five of us, two will
have been deported, two will be miss-
ing, and one of us will be dead. That is
what happens when you oppose the
Maduro regime.
One of those people who were at that
dinner meeting with me was named
Juan Guaido. His name became promi-
nent just a few months ago when he
stepped up in an extraordinary show of
political courage and declared himself,
under the original Constitution, as the
leader of Venezuela—directly con-
fronting Maduro and his regime. Since
then, he has received a lot of publicity.
He went to the border with Colombia
and tried to encourage the Maduro re-
gime to allow transports of food, medi-
cine, and other humanitarian needs
into the country. Maduro refused.
He also made it clear that he was
willing to risk his life. I met here in
Washington with his young wife, who
had a little baby girl. His wife had
come to the United States to plead his
case in the Halls of Congress. She knew
the danger her husband faced. Yet she
understood that he was willing to risk
that for the future of Venezuela.
Juan Guaido’s effort to become the
leader of that country has been recog-
nized now and acknowledged by leaders

of countries around the world. The Or-
ganization of American States—the
largest organization of Central and
South American countries—acknowl-
edged in a formal vote that Juan
Guaido would be the leader of Ven-
ezuela by their calculation. They didn’t
accept the Maduro election any more
than I did.
In the last several months, there has
been increasing tension and concern as
members of Guaido’s following were
jailed by the Maduro regime and con-
cern that Guaido himself may be in
danger because of this ongoing situa-
tion.
Early this morning, I received a
phone call from Ambassador John
Bolton, who works with the President
in the White House. He knew of my in-
terest in Venezuela, and he wanted to
alert me that today was a day that
could be historic, a day of reckoning.
Guaido and Leopoldo Lopez, who had
been under house arrest, were both ap-
pealing directly to the military leaders
in Venezuela, asking those leaders to
join their effort to establish a legiti-
mate government in Venezuela and to
have a free and fair election. We didn’t
know what was in store. There were no
predictions as to who would prevail in
this, and there was a great deal of dan-
ger associated with Guaido’s position.
Lopez, coming out of house arrest, is
risking his own life in the process. We
didn’t know what Maduro’s response
would be.
In the last several weeks, there have
been groups that have come to the aid
and support of the Maduro regime.
They include some Cuban security
forces, as well as colectivos and motor-
cycle gangs that support the Maduro
regime, but most notably the arrival of
several hundred Russian military into
Caracas. This, of course, complicates
the situation. There are rumors in the
press. We don’t know which to believe
and which not to believe, but at this
point, there is at least a question as to
whether Maduro was prepared to leave
and was discouraged by the Russians
and told to stay. I hope he does leave.
I hope Venezuela can turn the corner.
I hope the people of that country who
are leaving Venezuela by the millions
to go to countries like Colombia have
an opportunity to see a new life in
their country and to move forward.
I have supported the efforts of the
Trump administration against the
Maduro regime in Venezuela with an
understanding that they want to move
forward with regime change in that
country without the involvement of
U.S. military force. I think it would be
a mistake if we did that, to put in U.S.
military force. We are in a situation
where the history of that region is well
known. There has been a lot of tension
and a lot of difficulty in the past, and
I hope we do not consider that military
possibility. I certainly support their ef-
forts and applaud their success in
bringing the Organization of American
States and other countries to the side
of Juan Guaido and Leopoldo Lopez.
I urge Maduro to do the right thing
for Venezuela—to avoid bloodshed, to
accept Guaido’s amnesty offer, and to
step out of the way of a long-overdue
transition and return to democracy.
Until then, I support President
Guaido’s peaceful effort to advance the
constitutional transition period in
which a credible and timely election
can be prepared under his leadership.
Mr. Guaido is literally putting his life
on the line for the future of his coun-
try. The Russians and Cubans in Cara-
cas who attempt to prop up Mr.
Maduro must step back and let the
Venezuelan people decide their own

Madam President, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania.
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak as in
morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I
come to the floor tonight to discuss the
troubling state of judicial nominations
before the Senate. This week, we are
voting on, among others, two district
court nominees—Campbell Barker and
Andrew Brasher—who have, in my
judgment, very concerning records.
Just several weeks ago, Senate Re-
publicans changed the Senate rules so
that they can continue to put on the
Federal bench highly ideological and
sometimes unqualified jurists who have
the corporate stamp of approval but I
don’t think the mainstream stamp of
approval. Under new Senate rules,
these nominees will receive only 2
hours of postcloture consideration time
on the Senate floor, but if confirmed,
they would sit on the Federal bench for
life. So 2 hours postcloture for a life-
time appointment.
I will start with Mr. Campbell Bark-
er, who has been nominated to the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District
of Texas. He has a troubling record
from his time as deputy solicitor gen-
eral of the State of Texas. In 2016, he
defended Texas’s voter ID law, which
the Fifth Circuit said violated the Vot-
ing Rights Act because it prevented
minority voters from exercising their
right to vote.
Second, Mr. Barker submitted ami-
cus briefs to the U.S. Supreme Court
attacking the Affordable Care Act. In
those briefs, he argued that the indi-
vidual mandate is unconstitutional—a
position rejected by the U.S. Supreme
Court. He also opposed the contracep-
tive coverage mandate, which was a
critical part of the ACA’s efforts to
make sure that women have access to
the medical care they need. He also
signed amicus briefs arguing that busi-
nesses should be allowed to discrimi-
nate against LGBT customers and sup-
porting the President’s travel ban,
which, in my judgment, was a bigoted
policy that discriminated against the
Muslim community.
The second nominee I will make
some comments about tonight is Mr.
Andrew Brasher, a nominee to the U.S.
District Court for the Middle District
of Alabama. Like Mr. Barker, Mr.
Brasher has a troubling record from his
time in the state solicitor general’s of-
fice. In 2014, he defended the Alabama
State redistricting scheme, which a
Federal court determined violated the
Constitution because it packed Afri-
can-American voters into a few dis-
tricts, diluting the power of their vote
on the basis of their race.
Similar to Mr. Barker, Mr. Brasher
challenged the contraceptive mandate
in the Affordable Care Act and argued
that the reasonable accommodations
made for religious nonprofits were still
too burdensome—an argument that the
Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals re-
jected.
In 2015, he submitted an amicus brief
to the U.S. Supreme Court arguing
against the right of same-sex couples
to marry—a position the Supreme
Court has rejected.
Lastly, Mr. Brasher submitted ami-
cus briefs to the Supreme Court argu-
ing against commonsense gun laws,
such as age requirements for gun pur-
chases and restrictions on concealed
carry licenses.
There is no good reason why we
should be confirming these judges with
these troubling records on matters of
critical importance to many Ameri-
cans. There is no shortage of qualified,
mainstream attorneys or judges, State
court judges and other judges across
the country. Of course, in the case of a
Republican Senate and Republican
President, these judges are often Re-
publican in their party affiliation or by
way of their philosophy, but I think
there is often a big difference between
a conservative jurist or potential judge
who has a conservative view on
issues—that is different from being ex-
treme right, as many of these nominees
are.
Just by way of contrast to these
nominees and others we will be consid-
ering, Senator TOOMEY and I have
worked together jointly to recommend
experienced, consensus nominees for
Federal district courts in Pennsyl-
vania. Everyone knows we are in dif-
ferent parties. We have different views.
We rarely vote together. But we have
figured out a way on most days—not
every day, not every nominee or poten-
tial nominee, but on most days—to
work together to try to find consensus
for district court nominees.
I want to thank my colleague from
Pennsylvania, Senator TOOMEY, for his
commitment to our process over these
many years we have served together
now, since 2011. This process has al-
lowed us to confirm 18 Federal judges
to the 3 Federal district courts in
Pennsylvania since 2011. We have five
others who are being considered by the
Senate now, including Joshua Wolson,
whose nomination is on the floor this
week. I returned a blue slip and will
vote for Josh Wolson. He is experi-
enced. He has strong academic creden-
tials. He is a conservative. He probably

wouldn’t be my first pick, but I am
supporting him. He has been a partner
at a distinguished Philadelphia law
firm, the Dilworth Paxson firm, since
2008 and has both the ability and I
think the integrity to serve as a Fed-
eral district court judge. So that is a
demonstration that this process can
work when you have consensus, even
between Senators who don’t often vote
together.
This is a bipartisan process. It re-
quires both parties to work very hard.
It requires our staff to work hard. It re-
quires consensus. It has required sev-
eral White Houses now—the Obama ad-
ministration’s White House, as well as
the Trump administration—to work
with us. But we found a way to make it
work on most days.
This bipartisan district court process
is indeed the exception, not the rule. In
so many other instances, especially
with regard to circuit court nominees,
we have seen extreme nominees being
pushed through. The rule change that I
referred to earlier that cut the
postcloture time to just 2 hours means
there is very little time to fully con-
sider nominees to these lifetime ap-
pointments to the Bench. The Judici-
ary Committee has stacked multiple
circuit court nominees in single hear-
ings, giving Senators on the Judiciary
Committee less time to ask nominees
questions.
Circuit court nominees now receive
votes over the objection of their home
state Senators. That is new. That
wasn’t happening just a few years ago,
and it wasn’t happening many years
before that.
The blue-slip process has been evis-
cerated for circuit court judicial nomi-
nees. That is a loss for the Senate,
which may be the only body in the
world that has the kind of rules that
govern our work so that we will arrive
at a consensus by empowering the mi-
nority to work with the majority to ar-
rive at that consensus. It is a loss for
the Senate, but it is also a loss for our
constituents who are served by Federal
district courts and Federal circuit
courts.
Last year, the Senate confirmed
David Porter to the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals in Pennsylvania—
Pennsylvania being one of the States
represented in the circuit. That nomi-
nation and confirmation was over my
objection as a home State Senator.
This was in spite of my record of bipar-
tisan work on judicial nominations. My
record now goes back over the course
of three Presidencies and different Sen-
ates—Democratic Senate, Republican
Senate. Despite all the bipartisan
work, this nominee was both nomi-
nated and confirmed without my con-
sent.
For the first time in history, we have
confirmed two judges to the circuit
court—Eric Miller and Paul Matey—
without the consent of any home State
Senators, meaning you have two Demo-
cratic Senators who did not give con-
sent, and now they have been con-
firmed. I don’t think that is good for
the Senate in the long run. I am cer-
tain it is not good for our constituents,
as I said. I think they would prefer
judges who come through a process
where there is a degree of consensus,
including all of the vetting that these
nominees go through.
This isn’t how the process is sup-
posed to work. This process is supposed
to be one of advice and consent. Advice
and consent as to nominating people
for lifetime appointments to the Fed-
eral courts, especially the circuit
courts, has been gutted. ‘‘Gutted’’
might be an understatement. These
nominees will impact not just the lives
of the parties before them in court,
but, of course, the lives of all Ameri-
cans.
It is true that in our system, one
Federal judge can affect the whole
country. We know that from our his-
tory. And that includes both district
court judges, as well as circuit court
judges.
In the case of circuit court judges,
often that is the last stop. Very few
cases are briefed and argued before the
U.S. Supreme Court. In many cases,
the last stop is the Federal Circuit
Court of Appeals. For all intents and
purposes, that becomes the Supreme
Court for a lot of cases—the highest
level of review.
I hope we can return to a more inclu-
sive process that focuses on putting ex-
perienced, mainstream judges on the
bench rather than ramming through—
and that is the best way to describe
what has been happening lately—nomi-
nees with views and with records that
are out of the mainstream. I would
argue for purposes of the near-term
votes that both Mr. Barker and Mr.
Brasher would not fit under the um-
brella of being mainstream.
I think there are plenty of folks
around here in the Senate who would
like to work together to arrive at more
of a consensus. It doesn’t mean that we
will not have disagreements; it doesn’t
mean that one side will not have a dif-
ferent point of view. But I think some-
one can be conservative and philosophi-
cally aligned with one party or one
point of view without being so far out
of the mainstream that a lot of Ameri-
cans would consider them extreme.
I yield the floor.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT
OF BOOKER T. STEPHENS,
EIGHTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT
JUDGE, MCDOWELL COUNTY,
WEST VIRGINIA
HON. CAROL D. MILLER
OF WEST VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Mrs. MILLER. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Judge Booker T. Stephens, as he re-
tires from serving 34 years on the bench in
the Eighth Judicial Circuit, McDowell County,
West Virginia.
Judge Stephens was born in Bluefield, West
Virginia, and raised in McDowell County, West
Virginia. He graduated from Excelsior High
School in War, West Virginia. In 1966, Judge
Stephens obtained his Bachelor of Arts De-
gree in Political Science and Spanish from
West Virginia State College (University). He
served proudly in the U.S. Army from 1966 to
1968. Upon completion of his tour of duty in
the U.S. Army, Judge Stephens obtained his
law degree from Howard University’s School
of Law in Washington, DC. He returned back
to Welch, WV to practice law from 1972 to
1984.
Booker T. Stephens has served as a Judge
in the Eight Judicial Circuit of McDowell Coun-
ty, West Virginia, ascending to the bench in
1985. He was elected to the Eighth Judicial
Circuit and re-elected in 1992, 2000, 2008,
and 2016. Judge Stephens is admitted to
practice before the Supreme Court of Appeals
of West Virginia and the Supreme Court of the
United States of America. He serves as a
member of the prestigious Supreme Court of
Appeals Mass Litigation Panel and is a former
member of the Executive Committee of the
National Conference of State Trial Court
Judges with the American Bar Association.
Judge Stephens has been appointed numer-
ous times to sit as a Justice on the Supreme
Court of Appeals of West Virginia when a Jus-
tice has been recused from a case. He was a
member of the Standing Committee on Minori-
ties in the Judiciary of the American Bar Asso-
ciation; a member of the Supreme Court’s
Task Force to Study Perceived Racial Dis-
parity in the Juvenile Justice System in West
Virginia; and a former Adjunct Professor at
West Virginia University’s College of Law and
Bluefield State College. Judge Stephens has
served as an assistant prosecutor and a mem-
ber of the West Virginia House of Delegates.
Judge Stephens has received many honors
during his years on the bench. He was named
Outstanding Judge of the Year in 1993 and
2016 by the West Virginia Trial Lawyers Asso-
ciation. He has been a recipient of the Gov-
ernor’s Living The Dream Award by the Dr.
Martin L. King, Jr. Holiday Commission; The
Fred H. Caplan Civil Justice Award by the
West Virginia Association of Justice; Sara Lee
Neal Community Award of the Year for Health,
Science and Technology Academy; inducted

tion of Heroes and Legends; Layman of the
Year recognition from the West Virginia Bap-
tist State Layman’s Auxiliary; Presidential Cita-
tion, National Association for Equal Oppor-
tunity in High Education; Diploma of Judicial

cation; Certificates of Achievement, The Na-
tional Judicial College; Achievement Award,
Mountain State Bar Association; Earl Warren
Fellow, NAACP LDF; co-sponsored and Floor
Leader of the Bill that created a West Virginia
Holiday in recognition of Dr. Martin L. King’s
birthday. He is a member of the Board of
West Virginia State University Foundation and
a member of the Multi-Cultural Affairs Advisory
Committee at Bluefield State College. Judge
Stephens is a highly sought out speaker and
lecturer. In 1996, Judge Stephens delivered a
memorable and stirring commencement ad-
dress during the commencement exercises of
West Virginia State University.
Judge Stephens has presided over several
noteworthy cases in the West Virginia Su-
preme Court of Appeals, which include H. Har-
vey Oakley, C.W. Ferguson, III and Elsa Lou-
ise Kingdon, as a widow and Executrix of the
estate of Arthur R. Kingdon v. Glen B. Gainer,
A. James Manchin, and Martha Merritt, No.
16584, May 31, 1985. Authored the Majority
Opinion alone with Justice Chafin; Sam R.
Harshbarger v. The Honorable Glen B. Gainer,
State Auditor, November 23, 1988; TXO v. Al-
liance resources, 419 S.E. 2d 8870,1992 (Af-
firmed by the West Virginia Supreme Court of
Appeals 5–0 and United States Supreme
Court 6–3).
One of the many things Judge Stephens is
proud of is the implementation of Law Day in
McDowell County, an annual event that coin-
cides with the American Bar Association’s Law
Day. In its 23rd year in McDowell County, Law
Day provides an opportunity for students to
learn how the judicial system works and stimu-
late an early desire to pursue a rewarding ca-
reer in law. Judge Stephens often states, ‘‘I
know of no greater profession than being a
lawyer.’’
Judge Stephens along with his wife, Attor-
ney Gloria Stephens believe in giving back to
their community and have established an en-
dowment scholarship fund at West Virginia
State University. In recognition of this endow-
ment, West Virginia State University’s book-
store was named the Judge Booker T. and At-
torney Gloria Stephens bookstore.
Outside of his legal work, Judge Stephens
is a Life Member of the NAACP; a member of
the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity; Delta Theta
Phi Legal Fraternity and Sigma Pi Phi Frater-
nity. He is a 32nd Degree Mason and affiliated
with the MWPHGL Jurisdiction of WV, Inc. F
& A M; PM Excelsior Lodge No. 22; PM
Kimball Lodge No. 13; and PG Trustee. Judge
Stephens has taught bible study at Mt. Chapel
Baptist Church, Golden Harvest Nursing
Home, and Elkhorn Towers. He serves faith-
fully at his church, Heart of God Ministries, in
Beckley, West Virginia.
Judge Stephens is married to Attorney Glo-
ria M. Davis Stephens. They have two chil-
dren, Attorney Ciara M. Stephens, of Los An-
geles, California and Booker T. Stephens, II of
Welch, West Virginia and a new grandson,
Sebastian.
Over the course of Judge Stephens’ suc-
cessful law career, he has lived and practiced
by the scripture in Luke 12:48 of the Bible,
‘‘From everyone to whom much is given, from
him much will be required . . .’’ Judge Book-
er T. Stephens has given much to his state
and community in West Virginia.
As Congresswoman for the Third Congres-
sional District of the State of West Virginia, it
is my distinct honor to rise today to recognize
the outstanding contributions, distinguished
career in law and community service of Judge
Booker T. Stephens in the State of West Vir-
ginia, as he retires on May 31, 2019, from
serving 34 years on the bench.

HONORING PAT MCCORMICK
HON. JIMMY PANETTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Mr. Pat McCormick for 46 years
of exemplary service to our community on the
central coast of California. First serving as a
Planning Technician for Santa Cruz County
and later as a Planning Director for the City of
Capitola, Mr. McCormick’s prolific career of
public service is ending with his retirement
from the position of Executive Officer for the
Santa Cruz County Local Agency Formation
Commission (LAFCO), a position Mr. McCor-
mick has held with distinction for over 39
years.
Mr. McCormick has worked passionately to
encourage orderly growth of urban develop-
ment and ensure that it did not interfere with
agricultural lands on the Central Coast. Over
the years, he has made significant contribu-
tions to the development of Santa Cruz Coun-
ty by proposing over 1,200 boundary changes
and LAFCO actions. Working closely with City
Council Members, County Supervisors, and
local stakeholders, Mr. McCormick has helped
the Central Coast responsibly grow into the in-
credible community it is today.
Throughout his career, Mr. Pat McCormick
has been recognized on numerous occasions
by the California Association of Local Agency
Formation Commissions. In 2009, he was hon-
ored with the Outstanding LAFCO Profes-
sional Award and was recognized in 2018 with

IN RECOGNITION OF ST. JOSEPH
MERCY LIVINGSTON HOSPITAL’S
90TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor a hospital that embodies the spirit,
standard, and strength of the community it has
now served for 90 years. As St. Joseph Mercy
Livingston Hospital celebrates its 90th anniver-
sary in the community, I would like to offer my
congratulations and appreciation to the hos-
pital’s leaders, caregivers, and volunteers on
this most extraordinary accomplishment.
In its 90 years, St. Joseph Mercy Livingston
Hospital has grown its healing mission from
humble roots in a 3-story home to a state-of-
the-art, modern hospital with two campuses in
Livingston County. With a staff that today in-
cludes more than 500 physicians, St. Joseph
Mercy Livingston is the county’s only full-serv-
ice hospital, and includes state-of-the-art
robotic surgical services, a cancer center, 3-D
breast imaging, a sleep disorders facility, and
Michigan’s very first short-stay center, which
provides overnight care for patients not requir-
ing hospital admission.
St. Joseph Mercy Livingston Hospital has
received numerous accolades for its dedica-
tion to patient safety, quality of care, and ex-
cellence. But the organization stands out not
just for its commitment to the health of its pa-
tients, but for its devotion to the health of the
entire region. Before a single patient enters
the hospital, St. Joseph Mercy Livingston Hos-
pital is reaching out to. As one of the county’s
main employers, the organization generously
donates time, talent, and treasure to countless
community events, school groups, and non-
profits each and every year. The residents of
Livingston County are so fortunate to have at
their disposal this level of quality care and
community support so close to home. I am
honored to represent the fine men and women
who work hard every day to make St. Joseph
Mercy Livingston Hospital a source of pride.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me today to honor St. Joseph Mercy Living-
ston Hospital for 90 years of service, and to
the promise of many more years of healing to
come.

CONDOLENCES IN MEMORY OF DR.
IFTIKHAR AHMAD
HON. DUSTY JOHNSON
OF SOUTH DAKOTA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam
Speaker, in March 2019, the Black Hills Vet-
erans community lost one of South Dakota’s
best. Dr. Iftikhar Ahmad was kidnapped and
murdered when he returned to his native
country, Pakistan, on a personal trip. Dr.
Ahmad provided compassionate care to Vet-
erans for over three years throughout the VA
Black Hills Health Care System working in
Sturgis, Hot Springs and Rapid City, South
Dakota.
For years, Dr. Ahmad served our community
and our Veterans and specialized in care for
hospitalized patients at Fort Meade Medical
Center. His courteous and friendly demeanor
only amplified his dedication to helping his pa-
tients. We are grateful for his service.
On behalf of the constituents of South Da-
kota, I extend sincere condolences to his fam-
ily. He is sorely missed.

OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Mr. Bruce Glasscock for his
twenty-nine years of dedicated service to the
City of Plano and our north Texas community.
As a veteran of the United States Air Force,
Bruce Glasscock earned his bachelor’s degree
in criminal justice management from Metropoli-
tan State College in Denver, Colorado, and
later received a master’s degree in public ad-
ministration from the University of Colorado at
Denver.
Bruce began his career with the City of
Plano in 1990 when he was selected as the
Police Chief of the Plano Police Department.
During this time, Mr. Glasscock was elected to
the Board of Officers of the International Asso-
ciation of Chiefs of Police and would later be
inaugurated as the President of the organiza-
tion.
In 1998, the City of Plano provided Bruce
with additional responsibilities as the Deputy
City Manager. He would hold these dual roles
until assuming the full-time position of Deputy
City Manager in 2001. In 2011, he would once
again be promoted to his current role as City
Manager. As an executive level leader, Mr.
Glasscock has been responsible for over-
seeing a city with $2.5 billion in assets, and
over 2,300 municipal employees.
Under Bruce’s steadfast leadership, Plano
has earned numerous accolades as one of the
best cities in which to live and raise a family.
Due to his keen foresight, he has also been
instrumental in the city’s economic develop-
ment and unprecedented growth.
Bruce has held numerous civic positions in-
cluding playing a pivotal role in the founding of
the Collin County Children’s Advocacy Center.
As a recognized servant leader, he was cho-
sen by his peers as President in the Plano
Rotary Club and received recognition from the
Plano Independent School District Council of
Parent Teacher Associations (PTA). Addition-
ally, as a longtime and active member of the
nationally recognized Plano Chamber of Com-
merce, he was awarded the coveted Business
Executive of the Year.
On a personal level, Bruce and his wife,
Memrie, are the proud parents of two sons,
and three grandchildren with whom he looks
forward to enjoying his retirement with.
It has been an honor to know and work with
Bruce Glasscock. As Bruce begins this next
season of his life, I ask my colleagues in the
United States House of Representatives to
join me in recognizing him for his combined
forty-nine year career in municipal govern-
ment, and to wish him well in all his future en-
deavors.

RECOGNIZING THE 30TH
ANNIVERSARY OF SAFE STREETS
HON. DEREK KILMER
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in recognition of the 30th anniversary of Safe
Streets. Since its founding in 1989, Safe
Streets has made a lasting and transformative
impact across the many diverse neighbor-
hoods and communities throughout Tacoma
and Pierce County.
Operating as a community-led grassroots ef-
fort, Safe Streets has thrived through a dedi-
cation to building a broad coalition of friends
and neighbors that seek to create vibrant and
flourishing neighborhoods across Pierce Coun-
ty. They are made up of interfaith leaders,
business owners, school teachers, law en-
forcement, and devoted volunteers from the
community.
Safe Streets has organized and trained a
network of 125 Neighborhood Groups in
neighborhoods, involving over 13,500 commu-
nity leaders and 190,000 residents who work
daily to ensure that their neighborhoods and
schools are safe. Safe Streets’ Community
Mobilizers help these Neighborhood Groups
define and address their own needs by uti-
lizing organized block watches, youth leader-
ship teams, graffiti removal teams, safe routes
to school, and widespread substance abuse
and violence prevention education initiatives.
Safe Streets is doing significant work in
adapting and evolving as an organization to
meet the ever-changing needs and demands
of its communities. Through the development
of their Non-English Speaking (NES) program,
Safe Streets now provides services to resi-
dents who have limited or no English-speaking
experience. As a result, Safe Streets has been
able to regularly connect and meet with com-
munity members from the Japanese, Korean,
Samoan, Chinese, Philippine, and Cambodian
communities, among others, of Pierce County.
Safe Streets is also revered for their work in
engaging, mobilizing, and mentoring young
people across Pierce County. Many high
schools in our communities have established
Youth Leading Change (YLC) clubs that are
made up of core students, guided by a teach-
er and coach, and supported by Safe Streets
staff. Participants in YLC learn leadership
skills and present on prevention issues to their
fellow students throughout the year. Alumni of
this program have won numerous awards on
the state and local level, including a trip to
Washington, DC in 2014 and multiple City of
Destiny Awards for Youth Leadership in the
City of Tacoma.
Madam Speaker, I can say with certainty
that our neighborhoods and communities
across Tacoma and Pierce County are safer
because of the work of Safe Streets. It speaks
to their tenacity that even after 30 amazing
years, the many volunteers and staff that
make up this organization are committed to

IN RECOGNITION OF MS. SHARON
‘‘NYOTA’’ TUCKER, J.D.
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor a distinguished scholar,
dedicated attorney, and true visionary, Ms.
Sharon ‘‘Nyota’’ Tucker. Nyota was honored
for her contributions to academia and her
community on Saturday, April 13, 2019, at the
University of Georgia School of Law.
A native of Dublin, Georgia, Sharon ‘‘Nyota’’
Tucker was born to the union of Mr. Willis
Tucker and Mrs. Cornelia Tucker. During her
junior year of high school, she joined six of
her fellow classmates from Oconee High
School in the integration of the previously all-
white Dublin High School. This first-hand ex-
perience with desegregation convinced her
that becoming a lawyer was the most effective
means of combating racism, upholding the
constitutional rights outlined in the Declaration
of Independence, and forcing a system to cor-
rect itself. Nyota went on to earn her Bachelor
of Arts degree in Political Science from How-
ard University, before becoming the first Afri-
can-American woman to receive a Juris Doc-
torate degree from the University of Georgia in
1974.
Upon becoming a member of the State Bar
of Georgia in 1974, she served in a number of
legal and academic positions, including staff
attorney in the Albany office of the Georgia
Legal Services Program; legal intern with the
Earl Warren Fellowship Program in the San
Francisco office, NAACP Legal Defense Fund;
and associate with the Albany, Georgia Law
Firm of Mary Young & Associates. During
Nyota’s impressive tenure at Albany State Uni-
versity (ASU), she served as a faculty member
and pre-law advisor, as well as a dual role as
ASU’s University Counsel (for eight years) and
ASU’s Chief of Staff (for five years). Her time
at ASU allowed her to work with some of the
brightest, most creative, and determined stu-
dents in higher education.
Nyota has been recognized numerous times
for her professional and community work. She
has received several Teacher of the Year
Awards in addition to the 2015 Trailblazer
Award by the UGA Black Law Student Asso-
ciation; the Justice Leah Ward Sears Award
for Distinction in the Profession by the Georgia
Association of Black Women Attorneys in
2016; the USG Chancellor’s Recognition for
Distinguished Service to the University System
of Georgia in 2016; and both the 2018 and
2019 Beverly Burton New Board Member of
the Year Award for the Boys & Girls Clubs of
Georgia and the Southeast Region. Moreover,
on April 13, 2019, the University of Georgia
School of Law unveiled a portrait of Nyota
honoring her impeccable legacy and influential
leadership.
Former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm
once said that ‘‘Service is the rent that we pay
for the space that we occupy here on this
earth.’’ Nyota has paid her rent many times
over and still continues to give a prodigious
amount of love and service back to her com-
munity. She has served on the Board of Trust-
ees for the Harry S. Truman Scholarship
Foundation, the Board of Directors for Liberty
House, and as a member of the Advisory
Committee on Law and Criminal Justice at the
Washington Center. She currently serves on
the Board of Directors for the Boys & Girls
Clubs of Albany and a member of the Dough-
erty County Hospital Authority Board.
Nyota has accomplished many things in her
life, but none of these would have been pos-
sible without the enduring love and support of
her loving children, Nairobi (deceased),
Sadiqa, and Macharia; and her granddaughter,
Imani.
Madam Speaker, today I ask my colleagues
to join my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the
more than 730,000 residents of Georgia’s
Second Congressional District, in recognizing
and commending Ms. Sharon Nyota Tucker,
J.D., on receiving a well-deserved effigy rec-
ognizing her commitment and contributions to
her community and academic field.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MRS.
KATHLEEN FINER
HON. TED LIEU
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speak-
er, today I rise to celebrate the life of Mrs.
Kathleen ‘‘Kay’’ Finer, who passed away on
March 2, 2019 at the age of 68. Kay was a
dedicated member of and leader in the busi-
ness community in Los Angeles County’s
South Bay.
Born on October 14, 1950, Kay grew up and
attended school in Inglewood; after attending
El Camino College, Kay started her career in
the fashion industry before taking time off to
raise her family. She was an active member in
civic life, serving as a reserve officer for the
City of Palos Verdes Estates and organizing a
neighborhood watch group.
Kay also devoted herself to promoting local
businesses, as a volunteer with the Malaga
Cove Business Association and President and
CEO of the Palos Verdes Peninsula Chamber
of Commerce from 2005 to 2010. She also in-
volved herself with a myriad of nonprofit orga-
nizations; she served as director of Commu-
nity Helpline, which offers a confidential, safe,
and empathetic space to talk for individuals
experiencing mental health crises. Her energy,
commitment, and warm smile helped her
make a difference in the community she loved.
Kay is survived by her daughter, Jessica,
and grandson, Colt. I hope that Kay’s family
takes comfort in knowing her memory will live
on in the people, businesses, and organiza-
tions she touched through her work.
HONORING MAJOR GENERAL WAL-
TER PIATT FOR HIS SERVICE TO
FORT DRUM AND ON HIS CON-
FIRMATION TO DIRECTOR OF
ARMY STAFF
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize a lifetime of dedicated
service. Major General Walter Piatt will be as-
suming his new role as Director of Army Staff
at the Pentagon after serving as Commanding
General of the 10th Mountain Division at Fort
Drum for the past two years.
Major General Piatt’s military career has
spanned nearly 40 years and taken him all
over the globe. He has previously served at
the Pentagon as the Director of Army Oper-
ations, Readiness, and Mobilization and then
as the Director of Operations, Army Rapid Ca-
pabilities Office. Through all that, his roots in
the North Country remained strong. Major
General Piatt served in the 10th Mountain Di-
vision twice, from 1999 to 2003 and from 2012
to 2013. During his tenure commanding Fort
Drum, Major General Piatt led efforts to
strengthen ties to the local community on the
premise that a ready post and division de-
pends heavily on the strength of the sur-
rounding communities. His leadership has not
only been beneficial to those stationed at Fort
Drum but everyone in the surrounding commu-
nities as well. While we are sad to see him
leave the North Country, I know I speak for
everyone in New York’s 21st Congressional
District when I wish Major General Piatt great
success in his new role and thank him for his
service.

Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, today, I am
introducing a House Resolution recognizing
the accomplishments and contributions of Viet-
namese Americans. I represent one of the
largest Vietnamese communities in the United
States, and I am proud to recognize the valu-
able contribution of 1.7 million Vietnamese
Americans living in this nation. The United
States is home to the largest number of indi-
viduals of Vietnamese descent outside of Viet-
nam. Currently more than 70,000 reside in
California’s 46th Congressional District.
In the aftermath of the Vietnam War, ap-
proximately 800,000 Vietnamese refugees
fleeing persecution resettled in the United
States. Today, Vietnamese Americans con-
tribute to American society through their work
in. business, education, science and tech-
nology, engineering, mathematics, literature
and the arts, gastronomy, the armed forces,
and public service at every level of govern-
ment.
Vietnamese Americans add to the rich cul-

HONORING THE LIFE OF OSCAR
DUNCAN
HON. STEPHANIE N. MURPHY
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Mrs. MURPHY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor my constituent, Oscar Duncan, who
passed away on April 10th, at the age of 75.
A long-time resident of Geneva, Florida,
Oscar Duncan lived an extraordinary life, and
leaves behind an enduring legacy. He was a
soldier, a law enforcement officer, and a suc-
cessful small business owner.
Above all, Oscar was the Duncan family pa-
triarch. He and his beloved wife Bernice were
married for 44 years, and he was fiercely pro-
tective of her. Heaven help the person who
said a cross word to Bernice in Oscar’s pres-
ence.
Together, they had 10 children, which led to
22 grandchildren, which led to 23 great-grand-
children. That’s more than a family. That’s an
army.
My office spoke to one of Oscar’s four sons,
Hannibal Duncan, about Oscar’s life. Hannibal
made clear that those who knew his father
best had the greatest respect and affection for
him.
Oscar was born and raised in Tampa, at a
time in our nation’s history when African-
Americans were treated unequally under both
law and custom.
Adversity made Oscar strong, as fire forges
steel. Everything Oscar Duncan achieved in
life, he had to fight for. Nothing was given to
him; he earned it all.
Out of high school, Oscar volunteered for
the U.S. Army, serving for five-and-a-half
years, including tours in Korea and Germany,
and rising to the rank of sergeant.
The same qualities that made Oscar a good
soldier made him a great man. Discipline, in-
telligence, toughness, fairness, self-con-
fidence, the capacity to suppress fear and
doubt, a sense of purpose. He was a natural
leader that others wanted to follow.
After leaving the service, Oscar earned two
degrees at an Orlando-area college and be-
came a police officer in Eatonville, famed as
the first city in the country to be organized and
governed by African-Americans.
In 1971, Oscar was a member of the first
class of black deputies selected to join the Or-
ange County Sheriffs Office, which had offi-
cially desegregated in the early 1960s but had
accepted only a handful of African-Americans
in the ensuing years. For nearly a decade,
Oscar woke up every day and worked to keep
central Florida safe, always the consummate
professional.
Then, in his mid-30s, Oscar decided to walk
a different path. He left law enforcement and
opened Duncan’s Food Mart in Eatonville, lo-
cated next to the dry cleaning shop that Ber-
nice ran. It became an iconic institution in the
city. Oscar did everything at the store—cook-
ing and cleaning, manning the cash register,
and handling the finances. The kids were ex-
pected to help as well, and it was here they
absorbed their father’s lesson that success de-
mands sacrifice.
According to Hannibal, Oscar explained his
decision to change careers by saying that, ‘‘at
some point in your life, you have to choose
between being a mouse and being a man.’’
For Oscar, being a man meant striking out on
his own, answerable to no one but himself. It
also meant giving back to the African-Amer-
ican community he cherished—creating jobs,
economic activity, and a place for folks to
gather and enjoy each other’s company.
Oscar ran the store for nearly 20 years, until
he suffered a series of strokes and his health
began to unravel. Hannibal said his father died
like he lived—no complaints, no self-pity. Just
dignity and toughness.
Oscar Duncan was a man until his final
breath. He will be deeply missed.
I ask my congressional colleagues to join
me in offering our condolences to those he
loved and to those who loved him.

PROMOTING HUMAN RIGHTS FOR
PALESTINIAN CHILDREN LIVING
UNDER ISRAELI MILITARY OCCU-
PATION
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM
OF MINNESOTA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, it is my
hope that Members of Congress and the
American people can stand united in the belief
that justice, human dignity, and human rights
are values we share and promote. Certainly,
when it comes to protecting the rights of chil-
dren we should be able to find universal
agreement that ensuring their safety and well-
being is a priority.
Today, I am introducing legislation to protect
children from abuse, violence, psychological
trauma, and torture. This bill condemns the
targeting of children with the intent to intimi-
date, mistreat, and abuse in a manner de-
signed to leave lifelong scars. This abuse is
completely preventable. Unimaginably, it is
abuse that is perpetrated not only with intent,
but systematically applied to intimidate, con-
trol, and create fear amongst families, commu-
nities, and an entire population. And, unbeliev-
ably, it is in part funded by U.S. taxpayers.
The children this legislation seeks to protect
are Palestinian who have lived their entire
lives under Israeli military occupation. The per-
petrator of this system of child abuse is the
Government of Israel and its military, police,
and intelligence apparatus occupying the Pal-
estinian West Bank. And, it is U.S. tax dollars
provided by Congress, the unregulated $3.8
billion military aid package to Israel, that helps
to cover the cost of Israeli soldiers arresting,
interrogating, and abusing children, some as
young as 9-years old, in the name of Israeli
security.
The legislation I am introducing—Promoting
Human Rights for Palestinian Children Living
Under Israeli Military Occupation Act—is ex-
pressly intended to end U.S. support and
funding for Israel’s systematic military deten-
tion, interrogation, abuse, torture, and pros-
ecution of Palestinian children. This bill not
only highlights actions by the Government of
Israel that violate international humanitarian
law by their treatment of Palestinian children
in detention, it affirmatively declares that
equality, human rights, and dignity for Pal-
estinians and Israelis are the values the Amer-
ican people expect the U.S. government to ad-
vance.
On March 16, 2019, the Israeli newspaper
Haaretz ran an in-depth expose detailing the
detention and mistreatment of Palestinian
boys by Israel’s military. It identifies Omar, a
ten-year old boy who ‘‘looks small for his
age.’’ Omar was arrested by Israeli soldiers
last December as he played in front of his
house because ‘‘he threw pebbles at birds that
were chirping in the trees.’’ Soldiers saw
Omar, caught him, knocked him down, and
kicked him. Omar wet his pants. The Haaretz
story states, ‘‘The 10-year old is one of hun-
dreds of Palestinian children whom Israel ar-
rests every year: the estimates range between
800 and 1,000.’’
Why would one of the world’s most ad-
vanced and powerful military forces, a nation
that possesses nuclear weapons, send sol-
diers to attack, terrorize, and detain a 10-year
old boy? There can be no justifiable expla-
nation.
On April 1, 2019, only weeks ago, CNN re-
ported on armed Israeli soldiers entering a pri-
mary school in Hebron to arrest a 9-year old
boy and his 7-year old brother. Such a story
is simply too extreme a violation of human
rights and decency to be rational. Yet, it hap-
pened and there is video footage (provided by
the Israeli human rights organization
B’Tselem) of the soldiers in the school and the
principal and teachers trying to protect the
children. Eventually, CNN reports 9-year old
Zein was ‘‘frog-marched away and taken to an
army vehicle.’’ Neighbors said the boy ‘‘was
taken off to a nearby military post.’’
In a terrifying description, the Israeli news-
paper Haaretz tells what happens to the Pal-
estinian children victimized by Israel’s system
of occupation and military detention: ‘‘They’re
seized in the dead of night, blindfolded and
cuffed, abused and manipulated to confess to
crimes they didn’t commit.’’
Since 2000, it is conservatively estimated
that more than 10,000 Palestinian children
have been detained by Israeli security forces.
The brutality and trauma inflicted on Pales-
tinian children by Israel’s occupation and sys-
tem of military detention in the West Bank has
been extensively documented by credible
international human rights monitors, including
Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International,
Israel’s B’Tselem, United Nations Children’s
Fund (UNICEF), Defense of Children/Pal-
estine, and the U.S. Department of State.
Israel’s system of military detention of Pal-
estinian children must be condemned and it
must stop. At a minimum, U.S. funding for this
state-sponsored child abuse must be explicitly
prohibited by law and fully monitored and en-
forced by the State Department. The detention
and ill-treatment of Palestinian children is a
cruel and intentional tactic of Israel’s military
occupation. It is intended to terrorize, inflict
fear, and send an unmistakable message that
Palestinian lives lack value.
Promoting Human Rights for Palestinian
Children Living Under Israeli Military Occupa-
tion Act amends a provision of the Foreign As-
sistance Act known as the ‘‘Leahy Law’’ (22
U.S.C. 2378d) to prohibit funding for the mili-
tary detention of children in any country, in-
cluding Israel. The bill explicitly declares that

it is the policy of the United States to identify
Israel’s system of military detention of Pales-
tinian children as a human rights violation in-
consistent with international law and the laws
of the U.S. The bill also establishes ‘‘The
Human Rights Monitoring and Palestinian
Child Victims of Israeli Military Detention
Fund.’’ The bill authorizes $19 million annually
for NGO monitoring of human rights abuses
associated with Israel’s military detention of
children. The Fund also authorizes qualified
NGOs to provide physical, psychological, and
emotional treatment and support for Pales-
tinian child victims of Israeli military detention,
abuse, and torture. Any Palestinian age 21 or
younger providing documentation of military
detention as a child is eligible for services
under this provision.
In 2017, I introduced H.R. 4391, the Pro-
moting Human Rights by Ending Israeli Mili-
tary Detention of Palestinian Children Act. My
goal was to shine a light on the dehumanizing
effects of military occupation and human rights
abuses on Palestinian children. The more than
thirty colleagues who joined as co-sponsors in
the 115th Congress were courageous and
fearless promoters of human dignity and the
belief that the U.S. has the obligation to pro-
tect human rights, not use U.S. tax dollars to
help fund the abuse of children.
I strongly believe there is a growing con-
sensus among the American people that the
Palestinian people deserve justice, equality,
human rights, and the right to self-determina-
tion. After more than fifty years of Israeli mili-
tary occupation and now the promise by
Israel’s prime minister to annex Palestinian
lands, it is time to stand up for Palestinian
rights and stand with Palestinians, Americans,
Israelis, and people around the world to reject
the destructive, dehumanizing, and anti-peace
policies of Prime Minister Netanyahu and
President Trump.
The Promoting Human Rights for Pales-
tinian Children Living Under Israeli Military Oc-
cupation Act is a step in that direction. It gives
my congressional colleagues a clear choice—
support human rights for Palestinian children
and their families or support perpetuating the
occupation and repression in the name of
Israel’s security. For the cause of peace, jus-
tice, human dignity, and a better future for Pal-
estinians, Israelis, and Americans I intend to
work tirelessly this Congress to advance this
bill.

ARTHUR GEORGE BENZLE’S 100TH
BIRTHDAY
HON. JOE CUNNINGHAM
OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, a few
weeks ago, I hit a 100-milestone that I thought
was pretty important—my 100th day in Office.
However, I stand here today to celebrate a
slightly more important centennial milestone.
On Friday, April 26, Hilton Head resident Ar-
thur George Benzle turned 100.
Born in Ohio, Arthur moved to New York
City for his first job at UPS when he was only
19 years old. His rent was 15 dollars a month
on his 40 cent hourly pay, and he would ride
the subway for five cents. Arthur worked over
30 years in a produce brokerage business,
making junior partner and partial owner of AG
Benzle & Son.
Arthur describes meeting his wife, Martha,
‘‘the luckiest day of his life’’, and is dedicated
to a life of travel—visiting 66 countries and
counting. His favorite country is still the United
States for its ‘‘freedom, beauty, and diversity’’;
I wholeheartedly agree with Arthur here.
I want to wish a very happy 100th birthday
to Arthur Benzle, and many more years of
travel, golf, and family.

IN RECOGNITION OF CHABAD
LUBAVITCH OF GREATER
GAINESVILLE AND MANASSAS
FIRST TORAH

OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of Chabad Lubavitch of
Greater Gainesville and Manassas First Torah.
On April 7, 2019, the Chabad Lubavitch of
Greater Gainesville and Manassas completed
and dedicated the First Torah ever in Western
Prince William County.
The Torah is an unbroken chain of Jewish
survival and tradition going back over 3,300
years to when the Jews received the Torah at
Mount Sinai. In fact, crafting a single Torah
scroll takes over a year to complete. The
Gainesville Jewish Community came out to
participate in the Torah’s completion and to
celebrate with music, singing, and dancing
festivities.
Established in June 2017, Chabad
Lubavitch of Greater Gainesville and Manas-
sas is currently the only Jewish center/organi-
zation in Gainesville and Western Prince Wil-
liam County. Under the guidance and inspira-
tion of Lubavitcher Rebbe and Rabbi
Menachem M. Schneerson OBM, they have
both strived to make it a home for every Jew
in Prince William County, regardless of their
level of observance or affiliation.
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in
recognition of Chabad Lubavitch of Greater
Gainesville and Manassas First Torah. The
welcoming of the Torah is a remarkable
achievement for the Gainesville Jewish Com-
munity, just as they continue to grow and es-
tablish a welcoming Jewish community in the
area. May God bless the Prince William
Chabad Center and I look forward to seeing
their presence continue for many years to
come.

tention Center as a Sworn Deputy. During her
law enforcement career, Captain Heggins has
served on the Mental Health Task Force, as
team leader for the Crisis and Hostage Nego-
tiator Committee, and as a basic law enforce-
ment training instructor. She also finds time to
work with the homeless through Main Street
Mission.
Over the course of her career, Captain
Heggins has climbed the ranks and was the
first African American woman to ever be pro-
moted to the Lieutenant rank with the
Cabarrus County Sheriff’s Office. She is hard
working, driven, and promotes a level of excel-
lence that is hard to come by, she is a role
model for all of us.
The Robert Jackson Eury Memorial Award
is presented in memory of Robert Jackson
Eury, a man who lost his life in the line of duty
while serving as a Cabarrus County law en-
forcement officer. This award keeps Mr. Eury’s
legacy alive through officers who share his
same admirable and commendable spirit in
Cabarrus County. Based on her career of
service, I would say Captain Heggins fits the
mold of esteemed law enforcement officers in
our community set by Robert Eury.
Madam Speaker, please join me today in
congratulating Captain Laura Heggins for re-
ceiving the Robert Jackson Eury Memorial
Award. We all wish her well as she continues
to make a positive impact in our community.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 75TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF EXERCISE TIGER
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the 75th anniversary of Exercise
Tiger and the 30th anniversary of its monu-
ment being erected in New Bedford, Massa-
chusetts.
Dedicated in 1989, this monument honors
the lives lost during the attack on Exercise
Tiger, a military training operation that was
ambushed by a German flotilla on April 28,
1944. This brutal surprise attack, mounted
during a D-Day dry run off the coast of Devon,
England, claimed the lives of 749 United
States service members in the second dead-
liest episode of World War II behind Pearl
Harbor. This proud memorial will serve as a
reminder for generations to come of the serv-
ice of the men and women who fought in
World War II and the sacrifices that were
made to protect the United States and banner
of peace and democracy across the world.
As we observe the 75th anniversary of this
tragic loss of life, we are reminded of the high
price paid by those who have laid down their
lives in defense of our country. I would like to
extend a special thanks to the City of New
Bedford and the dedicated members of its vet-
eran community, who continue to inspire
through their dedication to preserving history
and honoring the legacy of our proud service
members.
Madam Speaker, it brings me great pleas-
ure to recognize the 30th anniversary of this
important monument and to call attention yet
again to the memory of all those who tragically
lost their lives during Exercise Tiger.

TARGET PRACTICE AND MARKS-
MANSHIP TRAINING SUPPORT
ACT
SPEECH OF
HON. RON KIND
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, as a lifelong hunter
and clay shooter at the Ettrick and Holmen
shooting ranges in Wisconsin, I have enjoyed
passing on the Wisconsin hunting tradition to
my two boys, and I know firsthand how impor-
tant these traditions are for many Wisconsin
families. That is why I’m concerned about the
decline in access to target ranges and gun
clubs throughout the nation over the last few
decades. Target ranges promote safe hunting
and responsible gun ownership, and they are
often used to sight in hunting rifles before a
hunting season begins.
I also believe it is important to ensure our
federal programs are working with hunters and
state fish and wildlife agencies to ensure that
we can preserve local wildlife and their habi-
tats for generations to come. However, this
goal is threatened by a decline in hunters
throughout the country—a recent study found
that the number of hunters had declined ap-
proximately 16 percent since 2011. Hunters
have generated billions of dollars for wildlife
restoration and hunter safety programs
through Pittman-Robertson (PR) funds, which
come directly from excise taxes on hunting
and shooting equipment. With fewer hunters,
there is less money available for protecting
our habitats.
As a long time member of the Congres-
sional Sportsmen’s Caucus, I am a proud
champion of legislation that supports sports-
men’s issues, and as a former member of the
House Natural Resources Committee, I have
built a strong record of voting to protect our
natural heritage. This bill supports both causes
by giving states more flexibility to use their al-
located PR funds to recruit and retain more
hunters and recreational shooters through the
development and maintenance of public shoot-
ing ranges. Under current law, there is a 75%
percent federal and 25 percent non-federal
cost share for all projects covered under Pitt-
man-Robertson. This bill would adjust that
cost share to allow states to use PR dollars to
fund as much as 90 percent of the costs of
acquiring land for, expanding, or constructing
a public target range. It also allows PR funds
to remain available to states for up to five fis-
cal years (compared to two fiscal years under
current law) for the use of acquiring land for
expanding or constructing a public target
range.
I will be pleased to see it pass the House
of Representatives unanimously. The bill will
go to the President’s desk, where I am con-
fident he will sign it into law.

HONORING DR. EDMUND
SCHWEITZER
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Edmund
O. Schweitzer III. On May 2, 2019, he will be
inducted into the National Inventors Hall of
Fame for inventing the world’s first practical
microprocessor digital relay for the power grid.
Before his breakthrough invention, utilities
relied on bulky relays made of springs,
magnets, and coils. Dr. Schweitzer turned
these cumbersome and old systems into pre-
cise and reliable ones with a digital relay that
is one-eighth the size, one-tenth the weight,
and best yet, one-third the price! His multi-
functional digital relay not only protects power
systems, it also records data and identifies
faults. As a result, he’s inspired even more in-
ventions that have become the standard fea-
tures for protective data relays around the
globe.
In short, Dr. Schweitzer revolutionized our
power grid with computer-based protection
and control equipment. Of course, what I’m
most proud of is that Pullman, Washington, is
home to his great success story. It’s where he
earned his doctorate at Washington State Uni-
versity in 1977.
It’s also in Pullman where Dr. Schweitzer
built his company, Schweitzer Engineering
Laboratories (SEL), which has created thou-
sands and thousands of jobs in rural Eastern
Washington since 1982 and is now a 100 per-
cent employee-owned ESOP.
Madam Speaker, Dr. Schweitzer’s profes-
sional work is electrical engineering, but his
greatest invention is truly in human resources.
He’s led to create a culture of innovation, op-
portunity, and respect that has empowered
people in my district to have an opportunity for
a better life. Right now, SEL employs 5,200
people who develop and manufacture a suite
of products that make electric power safer,
more reliable, and more affordable for utility
companies, mines, factories, hospitals, univer-
sities and data centers in 164 countries
around the world.
I’m proud to call Dr. Schweitzer a friend and
a mentor. It’s not an exaggeration to say that
his work is the fulfillment of the American
Dream. He’s a living example of the wonderful
accomplishments that are made possible
when the seeds of invention are able to grow
freely without federal regulations holding them
back.
This week, Dr. Schweitzer will have the
amazing honor of joining Thomas Edison,
George Westinghouse, Nikola Tesla, and
Hedy Lamarr in the National Inventors Hall of
Fame. On behalf of the 116th United States
Congress and Washington’s Fifth Congres-
sional District, I’m proud to congratulate him
and thank him for his ingenuity that will inspire
many Americans for decades to come.

RECOGNIZING AND CONGRATU-
LATING JOSEPH WAKELEY FOR
HIS SERVICE AS CRAWFORD
COUNTY TREASURER
HON. JACK BERGMAN
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my
honor to recognize Joseph V. Wakeley for his
retirement as Crawford County Treasurer.
Through his exceptional leadership and stead-
fast devotion to his community, Joe has be-
come an indispensable part of Michigan’s First
District.
Joe has dedicated more than 45 years to
the people of Crawford County and the state
of Michigan. Since first taking office in 1973,
Joseph has shown a constant vigilance in his
stewardship and responsibility for the tax dol-
lars of the citizens that put him in office. From
starting as the youngest county treasurer in
the state of Michigan to eventually becoming
the longest serving, Joseph has never failed to
put the needs of his fellow Michiganders first
during his service. The trust that the citizens
of Crawford County have in Joe is clear—not
once during his 45 years in office has he
faced a challenger during elections.
Outside of his service as Crawford County
Treasurer, Joe has provided valuable support
and expertise in other areas, including Rotary,
the Jolly Redskin Canoe Livery, the AuSable
River Canoe Marathon committee, Michelson
Memorial United Methodist Church, Grayling’s
Project Rising Tide committee, the Beaver
Creek-Grayling Townships Utility Authority,
and the Michigan Association of County
Treasurers. His impact on the people of North-
ern Michigan cannot be overstated.
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to congratu-
late Joseph Wakeley for his decades of serv-
ice to the people of Crawford County.
Michiganders can take great pride in knowing
the First District is home to such a dedicated
public servant. On behalf of my constituents, I
wish Joe all the best in his future endeavors.

HONORING ANDREW WEIBRECHT
FOR HIS INDUCTION INTO THE
SKI AND SNOWBOARD HALL OF
FAME
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Andrew Weibrecht on
his induction into the U.S. Ski and Snowboard
Hall of Fame.
Andrew was a valuable and successful
member of the U.S. Ski Team for 16 years.
His foray onto the world stage began in 2006
at the Junior World Ski Championships where
he earned a bronze medal. He then went on
to the World Cup where he was on the po-
dium twice and placed in the top-ten eleven
times. Andrew captured his first Olympic
medal, a bronze at the 2010 Winter Olympic
Games, and followed-up with a silver in the
2014 games. He won second place in the
2016 World Cup and soon thereafter an-
nounced his retirement. While participating in
global competitions, Andrew would proudly
wear the Lake Placid brand on his helmet as
an official ambassador, demonstrating his
pride in the North Country for the world to see.
Andrew Weibrecht’s long and successful ca-
reer is certainly deserving of recognition. He
has always been a hometown hero to the resi-
dents of the Tri-Lakes region and certainly
makes the North Country proud. On behalf of
New York’s 21st Congressional District, I want
to congratulate Andrew on his induction and
wish him the best moving forward.

IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL
SARCOIDOSIS AWARENESS MONTH
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I
rise today on behalf of Americans affected by
Sarcoidosis and other related inflammatory
diseases to observe April as National Sarcoid-
osis Awareness Month.
Sarcoidosis can affect any part of the body
and cause serious disabilities by forcing one’s
vital organs and central nervous system to be-
come hyperactive. While this rare and dev-
astating disease annually affects over 200,000
people throughout all demographics, there are
significant racial, gender, and age-related dif-
ferences, as it disproportionately impacts Afri-
can-Americans, women, and individuals be-
tween the ages of 20 and 40.
Although research suggests the cause of
Sarcoidosis is a combination of genetic and
environmental factors, the exact cause and
progression of the disease are still unknown.
The unique nature of Sarcoidosis makes it an
enigma in the realm of medical science, and
despite increasing advances in research, it re-
mains difficult to diagnose with limited treat-
ment options and no known cure. Over the
years, several of my colleagues and I have
spoken on the House and Senate floors about
this fatal disease. During the 103rd session of
Congress, I introduced H.J. Res. 399, a
House Joint Resolution designating Monday,
August 29, 1994, as ‘‘National Sarcoidosis
Awareness Day’’ while also urging my col-
leagues in Congress to support extensive re-
search to find a suitable cure and treatment
method for individuals with Sarcoidosis.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the
United States House of Representatives to
join me in recognizing April as National Sar-
coidosis Awareness Month by acknowledging
the need for more efficient research into the
causes, diagnostics, and potential treatment
options for Sarcoidosis. I am pleased to have
the chance to bring a relatively unknown dis-
ease to light and to increase public awareness
of the need to support individuals with this life-
threatening ailment.

HIGHLIGHTING THE VALUE AND
IMPORTANCE OF INTER-
NATIONAL STUDENTS
HON. RODNEY DAVIS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to highlight the value and
importance of international students in the
United States. I am fortunate enough to rep-
resent numerous colleges and universities in
my district. I have a deep appreciation for the
important role these institutions play in pro-
viding opportunities for students around the
globe.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Cham-
paign, the largest university in my district, en-
rolls over 10,577 international students from
116 different countries. Illinois State University
boasts 502 students from 73 countries and
Southern Illinois University Edwardsville has
368 international students from 24 countries—
all of these numbers represent an increase in
last year’s numbers for each university.
I am proud to represent institutions like
these that welcome the world’s brightest learn-
ers. I believe that today’s students become to-
morrow’s leaders. The former presidents of
both Ecuador and the Philippines earned doc-
torate degrees from universities in my district,
and I know that presidents and prime min-
isters all over the world have earned their col-
lege degrees right here in the United States.
Welcoming international students and schol-
ars strengthens our diplomatic ties with coun-
tries across the globe and contributes signifi-
cantly to national security and to our economy.
International students are vital to our nation’s
fabric. Through the exchange of ideals, lan-
guages, and cultures, diplomacy is strength-
ened and our world is made a better place.

INTRODUCTION OF THE NUCLEAR
WEAPONS ABOLITION AND ECO-
NOMIC AND ENERGY CONVER-
SION ACT OF 2019
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I am
introducing the Nuclear Weapons Abolition
and Economic and Energy Conversion Act of
2019, a version of which I have introduced
since 1994, after working with the District of
Columbia residents who were responsible for
the Nuclear Disarmament and Economic Con-
version ballot initiative, passed by D.C. voters
in 1993. My bill still requires the United States
to sign and ratify an international agreement to
disable and dismantle America’s nuclear
weapons, to provide for strict control of fissile
material and radioactive waste and to use nu-
clear-free energy. In lieu of joining such an
agreement, this new version of the bill also
gives the United States the option to ratify the
United Nations Treaty on the Prohibition of
Nuclear Weapons (Treaty). Many nations have
already signed onto the Treaty. The Treaty
was drafted by the United Nations in con-
ferences in March and July of 2017, which is
why I did not include it in my previous bills.
According to the United Nations, the Treaty is
‘‘a legally binding instrument to prohibit nu-
clear weapons, leading towards their total
elimination.’’ I am pleased by the international
progress on this important issue.
Our bill continues to provide that the funds
used for nuclear weapons programs be redi-
rected to human and infrastructure needs,
such as housing, health care, Social Security,
restoring the environment and creating car-
bon-free, nuclear-free energy. The conversion
to a peace economy would occur when the
President certifies to Congress that all coun-
tries possessing nuclear weapons have begun
elimination under an international treaty or
other legal agreement.
The bill is particularly timely considering the
ongoing nuclear threat from the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea.
Our country still has a long list of urgent do-
mestic needs that have been put on the back-
burner. As the only nation that has used nu-
clear weapons in war, and that still possesses
one of the largest nuclear weapons arsenals,
I urge support for my bill to help the United
States reestablish its moral leadership in the
world by redirecting funds that would other-
wise go to nuclear weapons to urgent domes-
tic needs.
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this
legislation.

Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor William F. ‘‘Bill’’ Rogers, Jr., on re-
ceiving the Cabarrus County Bar Association
Liberty Bell Award.
A Tennessee native, Bill began his practice
in Concord, North Carolina in 1980 focusing
on Family Law. Bill has a reputation of being
professional, tactful and emotionally supportive
to his clients while providing counsel during
difficult times.
Bill lives in Cabarrus County with his wife
Nanda, and three children, Hannah, Seth and
Rachel. When he is not busy with his practice,
Bill volunteers for multiple non-profits in the
community, including Habitat for Humanity,
Coltrane Life Center, Hospice of Cabarrus
County, and Cabarrus Workshop. In addition
to volunteering and spending time with his
family, he enjoys both playing and listening to
bluegrass, traveling to the beach, and riding
his motorcycle.
The Liberty Bell Award is presented to an
individual that educates others on and uphold
laws that support American freedom. Through-
out his involvement in Cabarrus County, Bill
has helped many people regain their con-
fidence in our judicial system by being a con-
stant resource of knowledge. There is no
doubt in my mind that Bill will continue to help
the people of Cabarrus County with his un-
wavering commitment to serving others.
Madam Speaker, please join me today in
congratulating Bill Rogers as the Cabarrus
County Bar Association Liberty Bell Award re-
cipient and wish him well as he continues to
uphold our American freedom.

At a time when nations around the globe

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E512 April 30, 2019
In addition to bringing diverse perspectives
and new ideas to our classrooms, international
students have an economic impact. They cre-
ate jobs and stimulate our economies. In fact,
it is estimated that in the 2017–2018 school
year, in the 15th District alone, international
students contributed over $48 million to our
economies and created over 500 jobs.
But the economic value that they contribute
to this country is not in dollars and jobs alone.
In fact, individual current and former inter-
national students contribute their talents in our
communities each and every day across this
great nation.
I’m proud to have international students
contributing in a significant way in my own
congressional district. To cite just one exam-
ple, Rebin Muhammed is currently a Ph.D.
candidate in Mathematics at Ohio University in
Athens. His area of focus is Ring Theory,
which is key in the design of codes that facili-
tate space travel, digital communications, and
high-fidelity music recording. Originally from
Iraq, he is helping inspire the next generation
of mathematicians by volunteering with the
Southeast Ohio Math Teachers’ Circle and
The Math League of Southeast Ohio, which
coordinates math-related activities for diverse
groups of middle and high school age kids.
It is students like Rebin who deserve an im-
migration system that works. Perhaps most
importantly, we should continue to attract stu-
dents by creating a path to green cards for the
most talented. We should not educate future
leaders and innovators, only to force them out
of our country when they are on the verge of
the next breakthrough.
With tomorrow, May 1, as ‘‘Decision Day’’
for students to commit to colleges across the
country, I want prospective international stu-
dents to know their contributions are valued,
and they are welcome here. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in celebrating the contribu-
tions of international students and in working
to make sure the United States is the destina-
tion of choice for the best and brightest across
the globe.

IN RECOGNITION OF MARINE 1ST
LT. BRIAN MCPHILLIPS
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in recognition of the life of Marine 1st Lt. Brian
McPhillips of Pembroke, Massachusetts, a
dedicated soldier who gave his life protecting
his country.
Brian McPhillips was a native of the South
Shore of Massachusetts, and attended Boston
College High School. McPhillips joined the
United States Marines in 1998, and continued
to serve following his graduation from Provi-
dence College in 2000. He was based out of
Camp Lejeune, North Carolina and served
with the 2nd Tank Battalion, 2nd Marine Divi-
sion until deploying to Iraq.
Both in school and during his time with the
Marines, McPhillips earned a reputation for
being bright, enthusiastic, conscientious, and
always willing to go the extra mile. He could
have chosen to pursue any number of paths
in life, but he was propelled by a deep and en-
during love of his country and a desire to be
on the front lines of defending it. Testimonials
from former classmates, teachers, and fellow
service members speak to McPhillips’ unwav-
ering spirit of service and loyalty.
Tragically, Lt. McPhillips passed away on
the battlefield on April 4, 2003. As the South
Shore’s first casualty of the Iraq War, his loss
was felt deeply by everyone in the community
where he grew up. His memory and spirit will
live on through his loving parents, David and
Julie McPhillips, his sister Carolyn McPhillips
Quigley, and through the legacy of his cour-
age and devotion to his platoon, the military,
and to God and country.

Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Rear Admiral John P. Neagley of Edi-
son, New Jersey, who is retiring from the
United States Navy this year. Rear Admiral
Neagley has dedicated 35 years to the Navy
and his service is truly deserving of this body’s
recognition.
Throughout his distinguished career, Rear
Admiral Neagley has upheld the principles of
duty and valor. He has served at sea exten-
sively and was deployed several times. From
his service in Operation Desert Fox, to his
command of USS Fitzgerald (DDG 62) during
deployment in support of Operations Iraqi
Freedom and Enduring Freedom, Rear Admi-
ral Neagley has bravely helped maintain the
security of our country.
In addition to his service at sea, Rear Admi-
ral Neagley has held various leadership posi-
tions in the Office of the Chief of Naval Oper-
ations and the Littoral Combat Ship Program
Office. In his most recent assignment as Pro-
gram Executive Officer, Unmanned and Small
Combatants, Rear Admiral Neagley was re-
sponsible for the Navy’s small combatant
force, mine warfare capabilities and unmanned
maritime systems. His experience, knowledge
and initiative have distinguished Rear Admiral
Neagley as an outstanding leader who has ex-
emplified honor, integrity and professionalism
throughout his Navy career.
Rear Admiral Neagley is a graduate of the
University of New Hampshire and received his
commission from Officer Candidate School in
1984. He holds a master’s degree in Environ-
mental Management from Duke University, a
Master of Science degree in Financial Man-
agement from the Naval Post Graduate
School and a Master of Arts degree in Na-
tional Security and Strategic Studies from the
Naval Command and Staff College.
Madam Speaker, once again, it is my great
honor to pay tribute to Rear Admiral John
Neagley for his 35 years of service to the
United States Navy. I sincerely hope that my
colleagues will join me in thanking Rear Admi-
ral Neagley for his honorable service to our
great nation.

Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize a lifetime of dedicated
service as James Premo celebrates his 60th
year with the Westville Volunteer Fire Depart-
ment.
James Premo first joined the department in
April of 1958, and quickly proved an invalu-

He has also proudly served in a number of
roles outside of the department such as
Franklin County Deputy Coordinator and Fire
Investigator, as a member of the board of the
New York Association of Fire Chiefs, and on
the New York State Firemen’s Loan Board.
James Premo has not only bravely served
the department and his community as a volun-
teer firefighter, but also the entirety of New
York State in his elected and appointed posi-
tions. He has undoubtedly helped foster future
generations of firefighters that protect our lives
and livelihood, and has left an indelible impact
on his community. On behalf of New York’s
21st Congressional District, I want to thank
James Premo for his many contributions to the
North Country and congratulate him on his
60th year with the Westville Volunteer Fire De-
partment.

OF ISAAC PYLE AND EMMA
MUSTOE, RECIPIENTS OF THE
WEST VIRGINIA GOLDEN HORSE-
SHOE AWARD
HON. CAROL D. MILLER
OF WEST VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 30, 2019
Mrs. MILLER. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize two of my constituents, Isaac Pyle and
Emma Mustoe, who each earned the West
Virginia Golden Horseshoe award.
The West Virginia Department of Education
describes the Golden Horseshoe award as
being ‘‘unique in its statewide recognition of
scholastic achievement.’’ The award is given
annually to two hundred and twenty-one 8th
grade students who have outscored their
classmates on a West Virginia history exam
and essay about West Virginia current events.
A minimum of two students from each county
and one student from the West Virginia
schools for the Deaf and Blind are selected for
the award. In a ceremony during Golden
Horseshoe Day, the state superintendent of
schools uses an antique sword to dub each
kneeling student either a lady or knight of the
Golden Horseshoe Society. This is arguably
one of the greatest awards of that school year
for 8th-grade students.
Soon to be knighted is Isaac Pyle of Web-
ster Springs. Isaac is the son of Jeremy Pyle
and Dr. Allison Pyle. An exceptional student,
Isaac is a captain of the West Virginia History
Bowl Team for Webster County High School.
As the winner of his school competition, he
has qualified four times for the state Math
Field Day and has qualified for the state spell-
ing bee. Isaac proudly maintains a 4.0 GPA
and is enrolled in advanced courses.
Emma Mustoe of Webster Springs will also
join the rolls as a Lady of the Golden Horse-
shoe Society. The daughter of Tobby and
Janna Mustoe, Emma is a talented writer and
performer. She is a winner of the Webster
County Young Writers Competition. She is a
captain of the West Virginia History Bowl
Team for Webster County High School and a
winner in the Webster County Regional Lit-
erature Fair. Emma is also a member of the
award-winning Webster County High School
Showband.
As Congresswoman for the Third Congres-
sional District of the State of West Virginia, it
is my distinct honor to rise today to recognize
the dedication and achievement that Isaac
Pyle and Emma Mustoe have put forward in
winning the Golden Horseshoe award, I con-
gratulate them on being model students and
exemplary West Virginians.
