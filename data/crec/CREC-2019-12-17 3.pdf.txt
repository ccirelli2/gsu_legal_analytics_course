cluded in this explanatory statement and
should be complied with unless specifically
addressed to the contrary in this explana-
tory statement. While some language is re-
peated for emphasis, it is not intended to ne-

at the end of the explanatory statement ac-
companying this Act. Funding levels that
are not displayed in the detailed table are

an emphasis on age-appropriate workforce
readiness programming to expand job train-
ing and workforce pathways for youth and

Congressional Justification.
Apprenticeship Grant Program
The agreement provides $175,000,000 to sup-
port registered apprenticeships and includes
new bill language referencing WIOA, ensur-
ing that funds are only used to support reg-
istered apprenticeships, and that makes
funds available starting July 1, 2020 to en-
courage better management and oversight.
The agreement notes serious concerns re-
garding the Department’s misuse of reg-
istered apprenticeship funds and the Depart-
ment’s communication of this misuse to the
Committees, including testimony before the
Committees.
The agreement notes that funding under
this program should be prioritized to support
State, regional, and local apprenticeship ef-
forts, as well as efforts by intermediaries to
expand registered apprenticeships into new

resented populations.
State expansion grants have been used to
positive effect in States with high unemploy-
ment. The agreement directs the Secretary
to prioritize funding for national, regional,
and local intermediaries. The agreement di-
rects the Secretary to continue funding for
business and labor industry partner inter-
mediaries and ensure that labor inter-
mediaries are given opportunities to apply
for competitive grants, cooperative agree-
ments, contracts, and other funding opportu-
nities.
The Department is encouraged to support
funding industry or sector partnerships as a
means of expanding registered apprentice-
ships in in-demand industries. The Depart-
ment should collaborate with the Depart-
ment of Defense to develop registered ap-
prenticeships that address the critical na-
tional defense need for new submarine con-
struction. The Department is encouraged to
support programs in the health care, mari-
time, construction, and oil and gas indus-

shortages nationwide of drinking water and
wastewater management professionals and
encourages the Department to address the
shortage of water system management pro-

tion to the Committees in advance of any ac-
tion to close or deactivate a Job Corps Cen-
ter (Center), as well as in advance of any ac-
tion to establish a pilot program or dem-
onstration project at a Center. The Depart-
ment is further directed to minimize the
amount of time a Center is inactive prior to
commencement of a pilot program or dem-
onstration project and to ensure training op-
portunities and slots do not decline as a re-
sult of such pilot or demonstration. Not
later than 120 days after enactment of this
Act, the Department shall provide the Com-
mittees a report on the performance of all
pilot programs and demonstration projects,
including a detailed description of the per-
formance metrics used to evaluate the

renovation projects.
STATE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND
EMPLOYMENT SERVICE OPERATIONS

agreement notes that State unemployment
insurance (UI) systems are critical for ensur-
ing claimants receive timely processing of
benefits. The Department is encouraged to
provide above-base State UI funds through
supplemental funding opportunities to
States to the extent that unobligated funds,
not otherwise needed for workload, are avail-
able at the end of the fiscal year. Such funds
should support improving operations and
modernizing State UI systems to help ensure
that workers and their families receive fast
and high-quality assistance in their time of
need.
UI Integrity Center of Excellence.—The
agreement provides $9,000,000 for the contin-

ful oversight and transparency related to the
timely processing of visa applications for
temporary employment certifications. The

gressional Justification, OSHA is directed to
include annual expenditures on VPP for each
year since fiscal year 2015 as well as planned
expenditures in fiscal year 2021.
MINE SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION
(MSHA)
The fiscal year 2020 President’s budget re-
quest proposed to allow greater flexibility by
combining the enforcement functions for
coal and metal/non-metal into a single en-
forcement budget activity. This flexibility
shall only be exercised to bolster MSHA’s
ability to enforce the Mine Safety and
Health Act and provide greater protections
to miners. MSHA’s Office of Accountability
shall audit and publicly report findings from
reviews of crossover mine inspections and
monitor corrective actions to ensure MSHA
activities adhere to its policies and proce-
dures and meet the requirements of such
Act. In addition, the Inspector General shall
conduct a comprehensive audit of this con-
solidation of enforcement programs. Finally,
the agency is directed to include in future
Congressional Justifications historical and
budget year information on enforcement ac-
tivities and outcomes, distinguishing be-
tween coal and metal/non-metal mines. To
promote transparency into agency spending
on its enforcement activities, MSHA will
continue to separately present annual spend-
ing on coal and metal/non-metal mines as it
has in past Congressional Justifications.
The agreement removes authority, first
provided in fiscal year 2017, that allowed
State assistance grants to be used by opera-
tors for purchase and maintenance of contin-
uous personal dust monitors. No State has
elected to use such authority.
MSHA shall fully implement the require-
ments of section 103 of the Federal Mine
Safety and Health Act and make inspections
of each underground mine in its entirety at
least four times a year and each surface
mine in its entirety at least two times a
year. MSHA should use existing funds to
equip all MSHA mine rescue teams with next
generation mine rescue communications
equipment. To prepare properly for an emer-
gency, MSHA shall continue to devote suffi-
cient resources toward a competitive grant
activity for effective emergency response
and recovery training in various types of
mine conditions.
BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS (BLS)
The agreement includes an increase of
$40,000,000 to rebuild capacity at BLS and to

With the increase, BLS is directed to sup-
port the following critical investments:
∑ Provide an annual supplement to the
Current Population Survey to allow for col-
lection of data on contingent and alternative
work arrangements every two years and data
on other topics related to the labor force in
alternate years, including an occasional vet-
erans supplement;
∑ Restore the production and publication
of employment, unemployment, and labor
force data under the Local Area Unemploy-
ment Statistics program for New England
Minor Civil Divisions with populations less
than 1,000; and
∑ Initiate spending on the planning and de-
velopment of a new National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth (NLSY) cohort. BLS shall
brief the Committees on the annual costs
and a five-year plan for implementing the
new NLSY cohort within 90 days of enact-
ment of this Act.
When implementing these investments,
BLS shall not reduce or eliminate existing
statistical work. Further, BLS shall not re-
duce the number of full-time equivalent posi-
tions beyond the apportioned fiscal year 2019
full-time equivalent ceiling.
Within the increase, the agreement in-
cludes $27,000,000 to relocate BLS head-
quarters. BLS is strongly urged to consider
the needs of its employees throughout this
transition and to work with the General
Services Administration to address any out-
standing safety concerns and office space
considerations for the development of sen-
sitive economic indicators.
DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT
Bureau of International Labor Affairs
(ILAB).—The agreement includes an increase
of $10,000,000, of which $7,500,000 is for grants
to improve countries’ capacity to enforce
labor rights agreed to under U.S. trade
agreements and trade preference programs.
The remaining $2,500,000 is provided for addi-
tional monitoring and enforcement staff at
the Office of Trade and Labor Affairs and ad-
ditional labor attaches in critical U.S. Em-
bassies to increase field-based and inter-
national monitoring and labor compliance
facilitation.
ILAB should continue to release its annual
Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor
report, including its assessment ratings on
Generalized System of Preference country
efforts to implement its commitments to
eliminate the worst forms of child labor, no
later than it has historically.
Faithful execution of the Foundations for
Evidence-based Policymaking Act will en-
hance the evidence-building capacity of Fed-
eral agencies, strengthen privacy protec-
tions, improve secure access to data, and
provide more and higher quality evidence to
policymakers. The agreement directs the De-
partment to include in the fiscal year 2021
and future Congressional Justifications an
update on the implementation of such Act
for the current and budget years.
The agreement expects the Department to
prioritize the submission of timely, accu-
rate, quality, and complete financial and
award information under existing U.S.
Treasury reporting obligations in accordance
with established management guidance, re-
porting processes, and data standards estab-
lished under the requirements of the Digital
Accountability and Transparency Act.
The Department should continue to notify
the Committees of the planned uses of funds
derived from the evaluation authority in sec-
tion 107 of this Act.

NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE (NCI)
Cancer Moonshot.—The agreement directs
NIH to transfer $195,000,000 from the NIH In-
novation Account to NCI to support the Can-
cer Moonshot Initiative.
Childhood Cancer Data Initiative.—The
agreement includes the full budget request
for this fiscal year of $50,000,000 for the
Childhood Cancer Data Initiative, which will
facilitate a connected data infrastructure
and integrate multiple data sources to make
data work better for patients, clinicians, and
researchers.
Deadliest Cancers.—The agreement directs
NCI to develop a scientific framework using
the process outlined in the Recalcitrant Can-
cer Research Act of 2012 for stomach and
esophageal cancers and urges NCI to con-
tinue to support research with an emphasis
on developing screening and early detection
tools and more effective treatments for all
recalcitrant cancers. NCI is directed to pro-
vide an update on NCI-supported research to
advance these goals in the fiscal year 2021
Congressional Justification. Also, NCI is di-
rected to add esophageal and stomach can-
cers to future Research, Condition, and Dis-
ease Categorization (RCDC) reports. Finally,
the bill encourages NCI to place a high pri-
ority on researching these cancers, which in-
clude anaplastic astrocytoma, diffuse intrin-
sic pontine glioma, glioblastoma, Juvenile
myelomonocytic leukemia, high-risk neuro-
blastoma, recurrent osteosarcoma,
rhabdomyosarcoma, and diffuse anaplastic
Wilms tumors.
Gynecologic Cancer Clinical Trials.—NCI is
encouraged to work with stakeholders to ad-
dress priorities for the gynecologic oncology
clinical trials scientific agenda, including
consideration of the availability of trials for
these patients.
NCI Paylines.—Grant applications to NCI
have increased by approximately 50 percent
since 2013, outpacing available funding, with
requests for cancer research ten-fold greater
than other Institutes. With such a high de-
mand for NCI grants, only a fraction of this
research is funded. To support more awards
and improve success rates, the agreement
provides $212,500,000 to prioritize competing
grants and sustain commitments to con-
tinuing grants.
Precision Medicine.—The agreement strong-
ly supports precision medicine initiatives
that are critical to delivering the right
treatment to the right patient at the right
time. At its core, precision medicine aims to
understand and treat the underlying cause of
disease in individual patients. Once the un-
derlying cause of a patient’s disease is iden-
tified, this information can then be used to
gain new insights into the underlying basic
biology and disease pathogenesis, which will
ultimately foster the development of medi-
cine targeted to those patient populations
most likely to benefit. NIH needs to focus
cancer precision medicine efforts towards
comprehensive drug screening and precision
clinical trials and this agreement has in-
cluded sufficient funding to do so. Therefore,
the bill directs NCI to fund an initiative to
foster the clinical demonstration of novel
methodologies for individualizing identifica-
tion of cancer therapeutics. Programs should
be at a NCI-designated Comprehensive Can-
cer Center at institutions that have dem-
onstrated institutional investment in preci-
sion medicine, have a strong existing track
record in NIH-supported cancer funding, and
have the expertise to conduct in-depth
genomic analysis of cancer tumors and do
comprehensive drug repurposing screens of

tumor type. Additionally, regional multi-in-
stitutional consortiums that serve popu-
lations with significant health disparities
and traditionally underserved populations
are strongly encouraged.
Psycho-Social Distress Complications.—NCI is
encouraged to ensure that all of its des-
ignated cancer centers are managing and
measuring patients for distress as an inte-
gral piece of their treatment and follow-up
care.
Rare Cancers.—The bill supports a trans-
NIH collaboration, which includes NCATS,
to accelerate therapies for rare cancers and
to support broader sharing of genomic-re-
lated rare cancers data to accelerate re-
search and drug development for these can-
cers.
STAR Act.—The agreement includes no less
than $25,000,000 in funding for continued im-
plementation of sections of the Childhood
Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and
Research (STAR) Act. Funding is in addition
to the funds allocated in fiscal year 2019 to
expand existing biorepositories for childhood
cancer patients enrolled in NCI-sponsored
clinical trials to collect and maintain rel-
evant clinical, biological, and demographic
information on children, adolescents, and
young adults, with an emphasis on selected
cancer subtypes (and their recurrences) for
which current treatments are least effective.
Funding provided this year will allow NCI to
continue to conduct and support childhood
cancer survivorship research as authorized in
the STAR Act.
NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE
(NHLBI)
Chronic Disease Precision Medicine.—The
bill directs NHLBI to fund an initiative to
address chronic diseases through
translational science and the application of
a precision medicine approach and has in-
cluded sufficient funding to do so. Programs
should focus on diseases and disorders relat-
ing to heart, lung, blood, and sleep, and ac-
cess to populations with significant health
disparities. Programs should have a proven
track record of NIH funding in all of these
areas, as well as have NIH-funded programs
for health disparities research. Additionally,
regional multi-institutional consortiums are
strongly encouraged.
Congenital Heart Disease.—NHLBI is en-
couraged to prioritize congenital heart dis-
ease (CHD) activities outlined in its stra-
tegic plan, including improving under-
standing of outcomes and co-morbidities,
modifying treatment options across the life-
span, and accelerating advances by
leveraging CHD registries and networks.
Fibrotic Diseases.—The bill encourages NIH
to vigorously support dedicated funding and
research into fibrotic diseases affecting dif-
ferent organs, including the lungs, liver, kid-
neys, heart, skin, and bones. The agreement
requests a report on the current NIH Fibrosis
Interest Group and its progress no later than
90 days after the passage of this Act. The bill
encourages the Interest Group to continue
its efforts to bring together key stake-
holders, at the NIH and elsewhere, to develop
strategic paths forward to maximize efforts
in fibrotic disease research. The bill also en-
courages NIH to enhance its patient-centered
clinical research into pulmonary fibrosis to
include traditional observational and inter-
ventional studies looking at reducing
healthcare utilization such as hospitaliza-
tions, improving symptoms such as cough,
and prolonging life, and directs NIH to in-
clude an update in its fiscal year 2021 Con-
gressional Justification on its work relating
to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis following
the November 2012 NHLBI workshop Strategic
Planning for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
The agreement also encourages NIH to cre-
ate a funding mechanism to fund fibrosis re-
search across all organs, building on the
progress and leveraging data that has and
may result from NHLBI funded projects.
Hemophilia.—The agreement asks NHLBI
to provide the Committees with the final re-
port and national blueprint for future re-
search from the May 2018 State of the
Science Workshop on Factor VIII Inhibitors
and to take steps to implement the research
blueprint in collaboration with the hemo-
philia patient, provider, and research com-
munities.
Pediatric Cardiomyopathy.—The agreement
commends NHLBI for its long-standing com-
mitment to the Pediatric Cardiomyopathy
Registry and strongly encourages NHLBI to
continue to support cardiomyopathy re-
search.
Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syn-
drome.—NIH is directed to submit the report
on Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syn-
drome (POTS) that was requested in Senate
Report 115–289, now overdue, no later than 30
days after enactment of this Act. NIH is
strongly encouraged to include an estimate
of annual NIH funding allocated to POTS re-
search in its publicly available RCDC report.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL AND
CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH (NIDCR)
Temporomandibular Disorders.—NIDCR is
encouraged to continue collaboration with
governmental agencies and other stake-
holders in the project entitled
Temporomandibular Disorders: From Research
Discoveries to Clinical Treatment and to in-
crease funding to expand the science base in
this field.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND
DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES (NIDDK)
Chronic Diseases and Health Disparities.—
Kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity
are among the most common, costly, and
preventable of all health conditions. NIH
needs to focus chronic disease efforts on
those populations most affected, particularly
vulnerable populations and underrepresented
minorities. Therefore, the agreement pro-
vides sufficient funding for an initiative to
address chronic diseases and health dispari-
ties in these areas. The program must focus
on kidney disease, obesity, diabetes, exercise
medicine, and health disparities. Programs
should have a strong existing track record of
NIH funding in all of these areas, such as an
NIH-funded Nutrition Obesity Research Cen-
ter, Diabetes Research Center, Obesity
Health Disparities Research Center, and
O’Brien Kidney Center. Additionally, re-
gional multi-institutional consortiums are
strongly encouraged.
Diabetes.—NIDDK is urged to support re-
search to improve the treatment of diabetic
foot ulcers and reduce amputations. Further,
the agreement urges NIDDK to work with
NIA to explore the relationship between dia-
betes and neurocognitive conditions, such as
dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Finally,
the agreement supports efforts to utilize
adult-derived, non-embryonic pluripotent
stem cells for developing and commer-
cializing the use of the stem cell-derived is-
lets for both drug discovery and testing plat-
forms and therapeutic delivery to patients
with diabetes.
Liver Diseases.—NIDDK is encouraged to
continue to feature liver diseases research
considering recent progress and improve-
ments for liver disease patients.
Medical Foods.—The agreement encourages
further incorporation of research topics asso-
ciated with medical foods and patient care
into emerging research activities.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL
DISORDERS AND STROKE (NINDS)
Cerebral Palsy.—The agreement strongly
encourages NIH to prioritize and implement
additional FOAs to significantly strengthen,
accelerate, and coordinate Cerebral Palsy
(CP) research to address priorities across the
lifespan identified in the five to 10 year Cere-
bral Palsy Strategic Plan developed by
NINDS and NICHD. FOAs should target basic
and translational discoveries, including ge-
netics, regenerative medicine, and mecha-
nisms of neuroplasticity, as well as clinical
studies aimed at early intervention, com-
parative effectiveness, and functional out-
comes in adults. NIH is also encouraged to
coordinate with other agencies, including
CDC, to support additional research on pre-
venting, diagnosing, and treating CP.
Dystonia.—The agreement urges NINDS to
follow the recommendations of the dystonia
conference, including identifying new re-
search and therapeutic needs that will lead
to a better understanding of dystonia eti-
ology and evaluation of the status of
translational research that may lead to more
treatment options for those affected by
dystonia.
Opioid Misuse and Addiction.—The agree-
ment includes no less than $250,000,000 for
targeted research related to opioid misuse
and addiction, development of opioid alter-
natives, pain management, and addiction
treatment. The agreement directs NIH to ex-
pand scientific activities related to research
on medications used to treat and reduce
chronic pain, and the transition from acute
to chronic pain.
POTS.—NIH is directed to submit the re-
port on POTS requested in Senate Report
115–289, now overdue, no later than 30 days
after enactment of this Act. NIH is strongly
encouraged to include an estimate of annual
NIH funding allocated to POTS research in
its publicly available RCDC report.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND
INFECTIOUS DISEASES (NIAID)
AIDS Conference.—The agreement includes
$5,100,000 for the U.S. contribution to the
AIDS2020 Conference.
Antimicrobial Resistance.—The agreement
includes $511,000,000 within NIAID for re-
search related to combating antimicrobial
resistance (AMR), an increase of $50,000,000.
In April, the United Nations issued a report
that, like the 2016 review sponsored by the
government of the United Kingdom and
Wellcome Trust, warned that rampant over-
use of antibiotics and antifungal medicines
in humans, livestock, and agriculture could
erase much of the improvement in public
health achieved since the development of the
first antimicrobials in the 1940s. The agree-
ment includes $1,700,000 to fund a National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine (NASEM) study to examine and
quantify the long-term medical and eco-
nomic impacts of increasing AMR in the U.S.
The review should examine progress made on
the U.S. National Strategy and Action Plan
for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bac-
teria, including domestic and international
strategies employed by NIH, CDC, FDA,
ASPR, USDA, and USAID. The NASEM re-
port should make recommendations to ad-
dress any gaps in research and development
of therapeutics and diagnostics; efforts to
move new products to market; animal and
human surveillance, prevention efforts,
international coordination and collabora-
tion; and any other recommendations
NASEM finds relevant to stopping the spread
of AMR. The agreement directs NIAID to re-
port on trends in AMR-related Research
Project Grants, including the success rates
for such grants, and requests an update on
these activities in the fiscal year 2021 Con-
gressional Justification, including an overall
assessment of the progress to date of efforts
to address AMR.
Celiac Disease.—The agreement encourages
NIH to devote sufficient, focused research to

the study of celiac disease, including the
autoimmune causation underpinning the af-
fliction. The agreement urges NIAID to bet-
ter coordinate existing research and focus
new research efforts toward causation and,
ultimately, a cure of this disease. NIAID is
encouraged to coordinate with other Insti-
tutes and Centers as appropriate and to sub-
mit its plan for coordination and execution
of this research to the Committees no later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act.
Hepatitis B Virus.—The agreement urges ad-
ditional targeted calls for Hepatitis B Virus
(HBV) research to fund the many critical re-
search opportunities identified by the sci-
entific community in the Roadmap for a Cure.
The agreement urges active participation
and leadership by NIAID in the Director’s
newly established Trans-NIH Hepatitis B
working group and requests that NIAID sub-
mit within 180 days of enactment of this Act,
a research plan to pursue a cure for HBV in
coordination with the other Institutes and
Centers.
HIV/AIDS.—The agreement provides an in-
crease of no less than $25,000,000 over the fis-
cal year 2019 level for HIV/AIDS research.
Centers for AIDS Research.—As part of the
domestic HIV initiative, the agreement in-
cludes no less than $51,000,000 for the Centers
for AIDS Research.
Lyme Disease and Other Tick-Borne Dis-
eases.—The agreement encourages NIH to
issue requests for grant applications for re-
search to investigate causes of all forms and
manifestations of Lyme disease and other
high-consequence tick-borne diseases, in-
cluding post-treatment symptoms, as well as
research to develop diagnostics, preventions,
and treatments for those conditions, includ-
ing potential vaccine candidates. The agree-
ment urges NIAID, in coordination with
CDC, to study the long-term effects on pa-
tients suffering from post-treatment Lyme
disease syndrome, or ‘‘chronic Lyme dis-
ease’’. Specifically, the agreement urges
NIAID to evaluate the effectiveness of lab-
oratory tests associated with the detection
of Borrelia burgdorferi to diagnose the disease
early, which can improve the treatment of
patients suffering from Lyme disease. The
agreement is also aware of promising vac-
cine innovations to combat Borrelia and re-
quests a report within 90 days of enactment
of this Act on agency activities to support
Lyme vaccine development. The agreement
also encourages NLM, in coordination with
NIAID, to update its terminology in line
with new research to more accurately reflect
the long-term effects of Lyme disease.
Medical Countermeasures.—The agreement
supports the continuation of NIAID’s med-
ical countermeasures program, but expects
the Institute to make sure any future con-
tractor selected for the program can refine
its animal models, particularly small animal
models, to support the establishment of ade-
quate countermeasure efficacy to expedite
approval by the FDA. This requires close co-
ordination with NIAID and the adequate
level of technical personnel to carry out the
program’s important mission.
Universal Flu Vaccine.—The agreement pro-
vides not less than $200,000,000 to advance
basic, translational, and clinical research to
develop a universal influenza vaccine, an in-
crease of $60,000,000.
Valley Fever.—The agreement notes the re-
cent increase in the number of Valley Fever
infections in Western States and urges
NIAID to prioritize research on this fungal
disease.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL
SCIENCES (NIGMS)
Institutional Development Award.—The
agreement provides $386,573,000 for the Insti-
tutional Development Award (IDeA) pro-
gram, an increase of $25,000,000.
Maximizing Access to Research Careers.—The
agreement recognizes the importance of the
Maximizing Access to Research Careers
(MARC) program and encourages the con-
tinuation and enhancement of efforts under-
way with our Nation’s HBCUs. The agree-
ment also encourages NIH to continue and
strengthen its engagement of institutions lo-
cated in rural parts of the U.S.
EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE
OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
(NICHD)
Impact of Technology and Digital Media on
Children and Teens.—The agreement recog-
nizes that children’s and teens’ lives increas-
ingly involve widespread technology use and
consumption of digital media. The agree-
ment encourages NIH to prioritize research
into how these types of stimuli affect young
people’s cognitive, physical, and socio-emo-
tional outcomes, including attention, sleep-
ing routines, and anxiety.
Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network.—
The agreement fully supports the work of
the Maternal Fetal Medicine Units network
(MFMU) and encourages NICHD to continue
to build on its success by ensuring its highly
efficient structure of multicenter collabo-
rative research continues. There is par-
ticular concern that any change in the fund-
ing mechanism or structure for the MFMU
could compromise the ability of the network
to remain nimble and directly address the
changing landscape of women’s health, in-
cluding to reduce health disparities. The
agreement directs NICHD to submit a report
to the Committees outlining any potential
changes being considered to the funding
mechanism or structure of the MFMU net-
work within 90 days of enactment of this
Act.
Prenatal Opioid Use Disorders and Neonatal
Abstinence Syndrome.—The agreement en-
courages NIH to coordinate with other agen-
cies at HHS to support additional research
on prevention, identification, and treatment
of prenatal opioid exposure and neonatal ab-
stinence syndrome (NAS), including the best
methods for screening and treating pregnant
women for opioid use disorder and the best
methods for screening for NAS. Additionally,
the agreement encourages NIH to build on
the Advancing Clinical Trials in Neonatal
Opioid Withdrawal study to enhance under-
standing of the impact of pharmacological
and non-pharmacological treatment tech-
niques on costs and outcomes in the short-
term and longitudinally. The agreement fur-
ther encourages NIH to coordinate with
other agencies at HHS to support research
on innovative care models to optimize care
and long-term outcomes for families.
Research in Pregnant and Lactating
Women.—The Task Force on Research Spe-
cific to Pregnant Women and Lactating
Women issued a report to the Secretary of
HHS outlining 15 recommendations to facili-
tate the inclusion of pregnant and lactating
women in clinical research. The agreement
commends the Secretary for extending the
Task Force and believes this extension
should be for at least an additional two years
to continue to work towards healthcare pro-
fessionals and consumers having accurate in-
formation on the safety and efficacy of drugs
taken by these populations. NICHD should
oversee its part of the implementation of the
already released recommendations working
with other relevant Institutes and Centers,
CDC, and FDA. The agreement requests a
progress report be provided in the fiscal year
2021 Congressional Justification.
NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE (NEI)
Age-Related Macular Degeneration.—The
agreement recognizes the tremendous strides
in the treatment of patients with the ‘‘dry’’
form of age-related macular degeneration
and commends NEI for its planned first-in-
human clinical trial that would test a stem
cell-based therapy from induced pluripotent
stem cells. The agreement supports NEI’s
prospective international study of patients
that uses the latest advances in retinal im-
aging to identify biomarkers of the disease
and targets for early therapeutic interven-
tions.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL
HEALTH SCIENCES (NIEHS)
Hurricane Harvey Research.—The agreement
includes $3,000,000 for the continued funding
and expansion of research on the health ef-
fects of environmental exposures directly re-
lated to the consequences of Hurricane Har-
vey in 2017. The research should focus on the
full Hurricane Harvey-affected region, con-
duct follow-up health research on affected
populations on registrants, link to relevant
government and non-profit intervention re-
search programs, and provide critical infor-
mation on disaster preparedness through
data sharing and analysis.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING (NIA)
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias.—
The agreement provides an increase of
$350,000,000 for Alzheimer’s disease and re-
lated dementias research, bringing the total
funding level in fiscal year 2020 to no less
than $2,818,000,000.
Diversity of Clinical Trials.—The agreement
remains concerned about underrepresented
populations in research, particularly clinical
trials for Alzheimer’s. The agreement directs
NIH to report to the Committees within 180
days of enactment of this Act on how it is
implementing the actions outlined in the Na-
tional Strategy for Recruitment and Partici-
pation in Alzheimer’s and Related Dementias
Clinical Research, including NIA resources
that have been dedicated to these efforts.
EUREKA Prize.—The agreement requests a
report within 180 days of enactment of this
Act on NIA’s initial EUREKA prize competi-
tion, including the number of submissions
received and any unexpected challenges or
impediments encountered in executing the
challenge, as well as lessons learned that
could be applied to future Alzheimer’s or
other prize challenges. The agreement also
requests that the report include any rec-
ommendations to enhance the model going
forward.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND
ALCOHOLISM (NIAAA)
Mobile Assessment Technology Research for
Addictive Behaviors.—The agreement encour-
ages NIAAA to support meritorious research
to improve the prevention and treatment of
substance misuse, addiction, and related con-
sequences through the use of mobile tech-
nologies.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE (NIDA)
Barriers to Research.—The agreement di-
rects NIDA to provide a brief report on the
barriers to research that result from the
classification of drugs and compounds as
Schedule I substances no later than 120 days
after enactment of this Act.
Cannabis Research.—The agreement encour-
ages NIH to consider additional investment
in studying the medicinal effects and toxi-
cology of cannabidiol and cannabigerol.
Methamphetamine Medication-Assisted Treat-
ments.—The agreement urges NIDA to con-
tinue its ongoing trials to expeditiously find
and approve a medication-assisted treatment
for methamphetamine.
Opioid Misuse and Addiction.—The agree-
ment includes no less than $250,000,000 for
targeted research related to opioid misuse
and addiction, development of opioid alter-
natives, pain management, and addiction
treatment. The agreement directs NIH to ex-
pand scientific activities related to research

on medications used to treat and reduce
chronic pain, and the transition from acute
to chronic pain. Further, the agreement
urges NIH to: (1) continue funding research
on medication development to alleviate pain
and to treat addiction, especially the devel-
opment of medications with reduced misuse
liability; (2) as appropriate, work with pri-
vate companies to fund innovative research
into such medications; (3) report on what is
known regarding the transition from opioid
analgesics to heroin and synthetic opioid use
and addiction within affected populations;
(4) conduct pilot studies to create a com-
prehensive care model in communities na-
tionwide to prevent opioid misuse, expand
treatment capacity, enhance access to over-
dose reversal medications, and enhance pre-
scriber practice; (5) test interventions in jus-
tice system settings to expand the uptake of
medications for treating opioid use disorder
(OUD) and methods to scale up these inter-
ventions for population-based impact; and (6)
develop evidence-based strategies to inte-
grate screening and treatment for OUD in
emergency department and primary care set-
tings. In addition, NIH should continue to
sponsor research to better understand the ef-
fects of long-term prescription opioid use, es-
pecially as it relates to the prevention and
treatment of opioid misuse and addiction.
Further, the agreement notes NIDA has
started to investigate the links among res-
piratory health, disease, and deaths from
opioids to determine if addressing under-
lying respiratory physiology can prevent
death due to respiratory failure during
overdoses.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH (NIMH)
Suicide Prevention and Risk Detection Algo-
rithms.—The agreement continues to encour-
age NIMH to prioritize its suicide screening
and prevention research efforts to produce
risk detection models that are interpretable,
scalable, and practical for clinical imple-
mentation, including mental and behavioral
healthcare interventions, to combat suicide
in the U.S. In assessing research opportuni-
ties, the agreement encourages NIMH to con-
sider the recommendations included in the
Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention’s A
Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Preven-
tion.
NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE
(NHGRI)
Computational Genomics and RNA Mol-
ecules.—The agreement urges NHGRI to con-
tinue to support research on RNA molecules
and the mechanisms through which they af-
fect biological processes that cause disease.
Emerging Centers of Excellence in Genomic
Sciences.—The agreement includes no less
than $10,000,000 for a new competitively-
awarded center-based grant program for
Emerging Centers of Excellence. The purpose
of these awards is to build capacity at insti-
tutions that are not prior or current grant-
ees of the Centers of Excellence in Genomic
Sciences program. The agreement urges
NHGRI to include plans for sustainment of
this capacity-building mechanism in its 2020
vision report.
NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARY AND
INTEGRATIVE HEALTH (NCCIH)
Pain Management.—The agreement urges
NIH, along with DoD and VA, to continue to
support research on non-pharmacological
treatments for pain management to ensure
the best quality of care for our Nation’s vet-
erans.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON MINORITY HEALTH AND
HEALTH DISPARITIES (NIMHD)
Mental Health.—To address the multiple
causes of suicide, the agreement urges
NIMHD to develop a behavioral health ap-
proach focusing on at-risk populations and
building the mental health workforce at the
community level. The proposed model should
improve mental health care access to under-
served populations, including those in rural
areas, while simultaneously providing train-
ing to potential rural behavioral health pro-
viders.
Neuroscience Research in African-Ameri-
cans.—The agreement urges the NIH
Neurobiobank to work with NIMHD and rel-
evant extramural partners to develop the in-
frastructure needed to accelerate the dis-
covery of novel therapeutic targets for
neuropsychiatric disorders utilizing post-
mortem brain datasets from underrep-
resented ethnic minority groups, including
African-Americans.
Research Centers in Minority Institutions.—
The agreement includes $75,000,000 for the
Research Centers in Minority Institutions
(RCMI) program to support critical infra-
structure development and scientific dis-
covery in historically minority graduate and
health professional schools. The agreement
also recognizes the importance of the RCMI
Coordinating Center in ensuring that collec-
tively, institutions can engage in multi-site
collaborative research.
Research Endowment Program.—The agree-
ment urges NIMHD to move forward with the
recommendations made by the Advisory
Council workgroup to restore endowment eli-
gibility for the Research Endowment Pro-
gram (REP) to the original Congressional in-
tent, which includes both current and former
centers of excellence. NIMHD is requested to
report to the Committees on progress made
to implement these recommendations prior
to issuing its next FOA for REP.
JOHN E. FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR
ADVANCED STUDY IN THE HEALTH SCIENCES (FIC)
Global Infectious Diseases.—The agreement
urges FIC to continue its important work of
building relationships with scientists abroad
to foster a stronger, more effective science
workforce and health research capacity on
the ground, helping to detect infectious dis-
eases and building the capacity to confront
those diseases while improving the image of
the U.S. though health diplomacy in their
countries.
NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING
TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES (NCATS)
Clinical and Translational Science Awards.—
The agreement provides $578,141,000 for Clin-
ical and Translational Science Awards
(CTSAs) and encourages NCATS to fund,
through the existing CTSA hubs, programs
to address disparities and the significant
burden of diseases and other conditions that
disproportionately affect minority and spe-
cial populations. Accelerating this capacity
will reduce the burden of disease and pro-
mote health equity. Applying the CTSA
model to address long-standing regional
health disparities can provide innovative,
multi-disciplinary approaches to reducing
the burden of disease among vulnerable pop-
ulations.
Cures Acceleration Network.—The agreement
provides up to $60,000,000 for the Cures Accel-
eration Network.
OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR (OD)
7q11.23 Duplication Syndrome.—Duplication
7 syndrome is a rare chromosomal abnor-
mality and those affected by this chromo-
somal duplication are likely to experience
severe behavioral and developmental disabil-
ities requiring consistent medical treat-
ments and therapies. NIH is strongly encour-
aged to expand research on rare genetic and
chromosomal abnormalities such as 7q11.23
duplication syndrome.
Adult Cellular Therapies.—The agreement
encourages NIH, in coordination with FDA,
to explore the feasibility and utility of an
outcomes database for adult cellular thera-
pies that are either FDA-approved or are
being administered under FDA Investiga-
tional New Drug or Investigational Device
Exemption protocols.
All of Us Precision Medicine Initiative.—The
agreement includes $500,000,000 for the All of
Us precision medicine initiative. Funding
provided in the 21st Century Cures Act is re-
duced by $37,000,000 in fiscal year 2020. Ensur-
ing sustained, consistent funding for this
study is important. Therefore, the agree-
ment has chosen to replace this reduction
and increase base funding for the program.
The agreement directs NIH to continue its
efforts to recruit and retain participants
from historically underrepresented popu-
lations in biomedical research so that the
All of Us scientific resources reflect the rich
diversity of our country.
Further, the agreement encourages NIH to
continue to work with a broad array of chil-
dren’s hospitals and networks to leverage
their expertise and ensure greater diversity
in pediatric recruitment and enrollment.
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.—The agree-
ment directs the NIH Director to facilitate
further efforts involving, at a minimum,
NINDS and NIA, to study Amyotrophic Lat-
eral Sclerosis (ALS) disease mechanisms and
identify genes to facilitate the expeditious
development of targeted therapies. These
trans-NIH efforts shall bring together re-
search results that will be available to aca-
demic researchers, non-profit organizations,
and industry researchers, and will supple-
ment, not supplant, existing NIH-supported
activities for ALS research. The near-term
research opportunity to find a cure is real
for ALS. Any such breakthroughs will have
significant benefits for related neurological
conditions including TBI, Parkinson’s, and
Alzheimer’s. The agreement directs NIH to
report to the Committees within 180 days of
enactment of this Act on progress in fur-
thering these research areas, specifically on
key areas of focus for fiscal years 2020–2024.
Autism.—The agreement encourages NIH to
continue to aggressively invest in research
on autism consistent with the objectives
outlined in the Strategic Plan. The agree-
ment also encourages NIH to support greater
investment in research and collaborations
focused on addressing the gaps outlined in
the Strategic Plan, including studies to un-
derstand the intersection of biology, behav-
ior, and the environment.
Autoimmune Conditions.—Autoimmune dis-
eases are more common in women than in
men, typically manifesting in their child-
bearing years. They include conditions such
as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis,
lupus, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel
disease, and type 1 diabetes and together af-
fect an estimated five to seven percent of
Americans. Many affected women live with a
second autoimmune illness or other condi-
tion. Despite the impact of these diseases
and conditions on a domestic population
ranging between 15,000,000–25,000,000, there is
no single office within NIH tasked with co-
ordinating research across the agency, or ex-
amining the complex interplay among these
diseases and conditions. The 2010 NASEM
study on Women’s Health Research identi-
fied autoimmune conditions as the ‘‘leading
cause of morbidity in women, greatly affect-
ing quality of life.’’ Despite their impact, the
report found that ‘‘little progress has been
made in understanding the conditions better,
in identifying the risk factors, or in devel-
oping diagnostic tools, better treatments, or
cures.’’ The agreement includes $1,500,000 for
NIH to contract with NASEM to identify and
review NIH’s research efforts in this broad
area of predominantly women’s health. The
review should explore NIH’s research in
autoimmune and coexisting disorders, in-
cluding any barriers to such research, and

the most promising areas for future research
that would benefit the greatest number of
patients. The review should also identify
trends among the population suffering from
these conditions, and any significant bar-
riers to accurate diagnoses. Finally, the
NASEM report should make recommenda-
tions for how NIH could improve and better
coordinate research into these diseases and
conditions, including the potential effects of
establishing dedicated research entities
within or external to NIH.
Big Data.—Despite launching its STRIDES
and Data Commons initiatives, NIH has lit-
tle yet to show in the area of working with
data. NIH has struggled to recruit the talent
to lead efforts to build an analysis platform.
NIH leadership recognizes it needs additional
focus on how to consolidate and deliver data
to the research community in a more usable
and computationally minable form, but is
challenged in how to do so. Part of the prob-
lem appears to be the salary restrictions of a
civil service structure that never con-
templated the costs of recruiting highly
sought after elite technology talent. The
Government Accountability Office (GAO) is
directed to identify and assess the options
available to NIH for securing the talent it
needs to lead these efforts. GAO should con-
sider how other agencies meet similar chal-
lenges, and whether statutory changes are
necessary. The agreement also directs GAO
to review how NIH funds computational tal-
ent in its grant awards and whether its fund-
ing models adequately reflect the cost of
these skillsets to grantees. GAO should as-
sess NIH’s guidance for the resource-sharing
plan it requires for the typical grantee, and
whether these plans are sufficient and can be
sustained for ongoing analysis. NIH is urged
to engage industry, academic, and other Fed-
eral partners to take advantage of cross-en-
terprise artificial intelligence products, re-
search, and tools. Artificial Intelligence
could play a vital role toward advancing the
goals of the strategic plan by organizing,
managing, and making data usable to re-
searchers, institutions, and the public to
drive outcomes. Finally, the agreement in-
cludes $30,000,000 to support the Chief Data
Strategist’s work in fiscal year 2020, and ex-
pects NIH to provide a spending plan for
these funds within 30 days of enactment of
this Act.
Biomedical Research Facilities.—The bill pro-
vides $50,000,000 for grants to public and/or
not-for-profit entities to expand, remodel,
renovate, or alter existing research facilities
or construct new research facilities as au-
thorized under 42 U.S.C. section 283k. The
agreement also directs NIH to allocate no
less than 25 percent of funding for this pro-
gram to Institutions of Emerging Excellence
to ensure geographic and institutional diver-
sity. Finally, the agreement urges NIH to
consider recommendations made by the NIH
Working Group on Construction of Research
Facilities, including making awards that are
large enough to underwrite the cost of a sig-
nificant portion of newly constructed or ren-
ovated facilities.
Brain Research through Advancing Innova-
tive Neurotechnologies Initiative.—The agree-
ment provides $500,000,000 for the BRAIN ini-
tiative, finally achieving the initial BRAIN
2025 report recommendation of $500,000,000
per year by fiscal year 2019. The agreement
provides additional resources to signifi-
cantly expand efforts to working with the
BRAIN data. Neuroscience, and biosciences
in general, need additional focus on how to
consolidate and deliver data to the research
community in a more usable and
computationally minable form. The agree-
ment expects to receive a report in the fiscal
year 2021 Congressional Justification on the
initiative’s achievements in its first five
years of operation and its objectives for the
next five years, including NIH’s plans to ad-
dress the challenge of making large datasets
usable.
Clinical Research Professional Competency.—
The agreement encourages NIH to continue
considering the training needs of the clinical
research workforce when determining best
practices in conducting clinical trials.
Clinical Trials Policy.—The agreement sup-
ports NIH’s recent announcement to delay
the implementation of certain registering
and reporting requirements for basic experi-
mental studies with humans. The agreement
urges NIH to continue its efforts, including
working with the basic research community,
to achieve a balanced registration and re-
porting strategy that meets the interests of
study participants, investigators, and tax-
payers. NIH is directed to report to the Com-
mittees no less than 60 days prior to moving
forward with any new proposals for reg-
istering basic experimental studies with hu-
mans as clinical trials.
Ethnic and Racial Diversity in Cancer Devel-
opment and Outcomes.—The agreement urges
NIH, including NIMHD and NCI, to continue
to support research on the cause, prevention,
and treatment of cancer in populations with
diverse cultural, racial, and ethnic composi-
tion. The agreement also encourages NCI to
continue to consider an institution’s re-
search efforts that specifically address the
cancer burden, risk factors, incidence, mor-
bidity, mortality, and inequities in the geo-
graphic area it serves, when considering ap-
plications from cancer centers for NCI des-
ignation.
Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Re-
search.—The agreement includes $12,500,000
to conduct research on firearm injury and
mortality prevention. Given violence and
suicide have a number of causes, the agree-
ment recommends the NIH take a com-
prehensive approach to studying these un-
derlying causes and evidence-based methods
of prevention of injury, including crime pre-
vention. All grantees under this section will
be required to fulfill requirements around
open data, open code, pre-registration of re-
search projects, and open access to research
articles consistent with the National Science
Foundation’s open science principles. The
Director of NIH is to report to the Commit-
tees within 30 days of enactment on imple-
mentation schedules and procedures for
grant awards, which strive to ensure that
such awards support ideologically and politi-
cally unbiased research projects.
Foreign Threats to Research.—There remains
concern about foreign threats to the re-
search infrastructure in the U.S. In par-
ticular, the Chinese government has started
a program to recruit NIH-funded researchers
to steal intellectual property, cheat the
peer-review system, establish shadow labora-
tories in China, and help the Chinese govern-
ment obtain confidential information about
NIH research grants. As the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, HHS, and NIH continue to
investigate the impact the Thousand Talents
and other foreign government programs have
had on the NIH research community, the
agreement directs NIH to notify the Com-
mittees quarterly on the progress of the in-
vestigation, as well as institutions, sci-
entists, and research affected. Further, the
agreement directs NIH to carefully consider
the NIH Advisory Committee’s recommenda-
tions, including to implement a broad edu-
cation campaign about the requirement to
disclose foreign sources of funding and de-
velop enhanced cybersecurity protocols. As
recommended, NIH should use this campaign
to help institutions develop best practices
for how to handle these challenges, including
training, communications materials, and
how to improve vetting, education, and secu-
rity. Further, NIH shall evaluate the peer-re-
view system and their internal controls
through a lens that takes into account na-
tional security threats. This includes hold-
ing those accountable who inappropriately
share information from the peer-review proc-
ess or illegally share intellectual property.
The agreement notes the partnership be-
tween NIH and HHS’ Office of National Secu-
rity (ONS) on this issue and ONS’s imple-
mentation of a formal NIH CI/Insider Threat
program on NIH’s behalf. The agreement be-
lieves this work should be expanded in fiscal
year 2020 and directs NIH to allocate no less
than $5,000,000 for this work that ONS does
on behalf of NIH.
Frontotemporal Degeneration Research.—The
agreement encourages NIH to continue to
support a multi-site network of clinical cen-
ters to study genetic and sporadic cases of
frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) and
maintain progress toward biomarker dis-
covery and drug development in clinical
trials using these well-defined FTD cohorts.
A key component of this network will be the
development of a data biosphere that sup-
ports wide sharing of robust datasets, gen-
erated with powerful -omic platforms. Data
sharing will enable the broader community
of researchers outside of the clinical net-
works, particularly early career scientists,
to take on the challenges currently con-
fronting Alzheimer’s disease and related de-
mentias disorders with a wider array of ex-
pertise. Research has revealed that all forms
of dementia may have a variety of root
causes and display multiple underlying
pathologies. Research on the related demen-
tias is critical for understanding basic dis-
ease mechanisms that may be common
across multiple forms of dementia and there-
fore speed the translation of this informa-
tion into much-needed therapeutics. While
the continued support of biomedical research
offers hope for the future, too many families
and individuals living with dementia cannot
find the help they need today. Therefore, the
agreement also urges NIH to support re-
search on the development of new and im-
proved dementia care practices and long-
term supports and services. By supporting
both types of research, NIH may advance
progress toward future therapies and treat-
ments while also helping people get the ap-
propriate and effective care and support they
need today.
Harassment Policies.—The NASEM report
released last year found that sexual harass-
ment is rampant in the labs and institutions
supported by NIH. The Committees believe
NIH must play a more active role in chang-
ing the culture that has long perpetuated the
problem. The Committees direct NIH to re-
quire institutions to notify the agency when
key personnel named on an NIH grant award
are removed because of sexual harassment
concerns and to submit to the Committees
plans to implement measures that attend to
harassment in extramural settings with the
same level of attention and resources as
those devoted to other research misconduct.
The Committees also direct NIH to support
research in the areas identified in the report,
including the psychology underlying harass-
ment and the experiences and outcomes of
diverse groups when subjected to harass-
ment. Additionally, the Committees direct
NIH to collaborate with NASEM to develop
best practices for developing more diverse
and inclusive cultures in the grantee re-
search environments, including training in-
dividuals in institutions that receive NIH
funds to recognize and address sexual harass-
ment, and evaluating the efficacy of various
sexual harassment training programs.
Hepatitis C.—The agreement urges NIH to
prioritize research aimed at supporting hepa-
titis C elimination.

Human Microbiome Project.—The agreement
encourages OD to continue working collabo-
ratively with NIDDK and other relevant In-
stitutes and Centers to expand and advance
Human Microbiome Project research.
IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Net-
work.—The agreement commends NIH for es-
tablishing the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical
Trials Network (ISPCTN) to provide medi-
cally-underserved and rural populations with
access to state-of-the-art clinical trials,
apply findings from relevant pediatric cohort
studies to children in IDeA State locations,
and enhance pediatric research capacity to
address unmet pediatric research needs in
underserved areas. The agreement provides
$15,000,000 in additional funding for the Envi-
ronmental Influences on Child Health Out-
comes Program to continue the ISPCTN pro-
gram.
Increasing Diversity in NIH Clinical Trials.—
The agreement recognizes efforts by NIH to
reduce health disparities by addressing sig-
nificant barriers to clinical trial participa-
tion and directs the agency to ensure eligi-
bility criteria for clinical trials funded by
NIH do not create unintentional barriers to
participation for racial and ethnic minori-
ties as well as for patients with certain
health conditions. The agreement directs
NIH to revise existing protocol templates
and guidelines for clinical trials that receive
funding by the agency to include eligibility
criteria that avoids inappropriate exclusions
of racial and ethnic minorities by taking
steps to account for variations in health sta-
tus across racial and ethnic minority groups
when determining eligibility criteria as well
as ensuring exclusions based on health sta-
tus are scientifically justified and appro-
priate.
Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.—The agree-
ment directs NIH to provide funding to sup-
port translational research, as well as pro-
mote regional, collaborative consortiums to
advance scientific knowledge in the area of
induced pluripotent stem cells basic re-
search. The agreement further instructs NIH
to conduct an assessment of agency efforts
to: (1) address the existing funding gap be-
tween basic science and clinical trial re-
search; and (2) develop a framework that pro-
vides both new and existing grantees with
funded opportunities for translational re-
search. The agreement expects this informa-
tion to be included in the fiscal year 2021
Congressional Justification.
Intellectual Property.—The agreement en-
courages the Director to work with the HHS
Assistant Deputy Secretary for National Se-
curity to improve the security of intellectual
property derived from NIH-funded research.
In particular, NIH is encouraged to: improve
the security of the peer review system; aug-
ment the application process to identify
funding that applicants receive from a for-
eign government; and assist the HHS Inspec-
tor General and appropriate law enforcement
agencies to identify violations of U.S. law or
policy.
Intramural Nonhuman Primate Research.—
The agreement recognizes the use of
nonhuman primate research for the advance-
ment of biomedical research. It also under-
stands that NIH continues to seek scientific
alternatives to reduce and replace nonhuman
primate use in biomedical research. NIH re-
views every project that uses nonhuman pri-
mates in research to ensure both the welfare
of the animal and that there are no scientific
alternatives that could replace an animal
model. The agreement requests a report to
the Committees no later than one year after
enactment of this Act that includes a discus-
sion of nonhuman primate use and efforts to
reduce such research use specifically, an as-
sessment of research alternatives, including
benefits and limitations of such alternatives,
cost estimates, and areas of further need for
innovative alternatives. In the fiscal year
2021 Congressional Justification, the agree-
ment requests NIH include a discussion of re-
search alternatives in use and those in devel-
opment.
Mucopolysaccharide Diseases.—The agree-
ment encourages expanded research of treat-
ments for neurological, chronic inflamma-
tion, cardiovascular, and skeletal manifesta-
tions of mucopolysaccharide (MPS) and ML
diseases, with an emphasis on gene therapy.
The agreement also encourages NIH to in-
crease funding to grantees to incentivize
MPS research, particularly given the age and
small population of current researchers. Un-
derstanding the manifestations and treat-
ments of both the skeletal and neurological
disease continue to be the greatest areas of
unmet need.
Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue
Syndrome.—The agreement commends NIH
on its new Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) efforts,
including its 2019 conference on accelerating
research into ME/CFS, the formation of the
National Advisory Neurological Disorders
and Stroke (NANDSC) Council Working
Group, and the unanimous adoption of the
working group’s report and recommenda-
tions on September 4, 2019. The agreement
strongly encourages NIH to implement the
recommendations in the NANDSC report, in
particular to accelerate the identification of
ME/CFS subtypes through the development
of an ME/CFS Registry and Biorepository
and to increase the number of ME/CFS re-
search grant applications by investing in
early career investigators as recommended
in the NANDSC report. The agreement also
recommends that NIH expand ME/CFS ef-
forts, for example, by developing: (1) new
ME/CFS disease specific funding announce-
ments, including those with set-aside funds,
to deliver needed diagnostics and treatments
as quickly as possible; (2) an initiative to
reach consensus on the ME/CFS case defini-
tion; and (3) mechanisms to incentivize re-
searchers to enter the field.
National Commission on Lymphatic Dis-
eases.—OD and NHLBI are applauded for fa-
cilitating the 2015 Trans-NIH Lymphatics
Symposium. Lymphatics research has the
scientific potential to treat a variety of se-
vere diseases, including heart disease, diabe-
tes, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. The
Director is encouraged to establish a Na-
tional Commission on Lymphatic Diseases or
other appropriate mechanism to explore and
make recommendations on the ongoing ex-
pansion and coordination of lymphatic dis-
eases research NIH-wide.
News Briefings.—Until recently, NIH pro-
vided the Committees with a summary of the
day’s news articles on itself, health and med-
ical news, global health updates, and other
topics affecting its operations. The agree-
ment directs NIH to resume providing daily
NIH news briefings within 14 days of enact-
ment of this Act.
Organ Donation and Transplantation.—The
agreement includes $1,500,000 to contract
with and fund a NASEM study to examine
and recommend improvements to research,
policies, and activities related to organ do-
nation and transplantation. The report shall
include: (1) identification of current chal-
lenges involved in modeling proposed organ
allocation policy changes and recommenda-
tions to improve modeling; (2) recommenda-
tions about how costs should be factored into
the modeling of organ allocation policy
changes; (3) a review of scoring systems (e.g.,
CPRA, EPTS, KDPI, LAS, MELD, etc.) or
other factors that determine organ alloca-
tion and patient prioritization and rec-
ommendations to assure fair and equitable
practices are established, including reducing
inequities affecting socioeconomically dis-
advantaged patient populations; (4) rec-
ommendations to update the OPTN’s policies
and processes to ensure that organ alloca-
tion decisions take into account the view-
points of expert OPTN committees; and (5)
such other issues as may be identified.
Osteopathic Medical Schools.—The agree-
ment notes concern about a lack of access to
research funding for osteopathic medical
schools through NIH, as osteopathic medi-
cine is one of the fastest growing healthcare
professions in the country, and realizes its
vital role in treating our Nation’s rural, un-
derserved, and socioeconomically challenged
populations.
Pediatric Clinical Trials Authorized under
Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act.—The
agreement directs that no less than
$25,000,000 be used toward research in prepa-
ration for clinical trials authorized by the
Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act.
Platform Technologies.—The agreement di-
rects NIH to provide a report in the fiscal
year 2021 Congressional Justification that
identifies: (1) the challenges that currently
limit NIH’s ability to support the develop-
ment of platform technologies, and how
these might be addressed. Potential exam-
ples include: (a) low levels of engagement
with researchers in the physical sciences, en-
gineering, math, and computer science; (b) a
culture that prioritizes hypothesis-driven as
opposed to technology-driven proposals; (c)
the structure of the NIH, which is organized
primarily around specific diseases or organs
of the body; (d) a typical size and duration of
research grants that may not be aligned with
the level of investment required for advances
in platform technologies; and (e) difficulty in
supporting high-risk, high-return ideas; (2)
the specific unmet needs for basic, clinical
and translational research that might moti-
vate investment in transformational plat-
form technologies that could be high-impact
and timely, given recent scientific and tech-
nological advances and unmet medical needs;
and (3) changes that NIH and Congress
should consider with respect to its ability to
identify and fund promising research pro-
posals for platform technologies. Examples
include: (a) recruiting NIH personnel and
members of study sections with relevant ex-
pertise; (b) supporting workshops and the de-
velopment of roadmaps for platform tech-
nologies; (c) increasing funding mechanisms
that are appropriate for platform tech-
nologies that are relevant to multiple NIH
Institutes, such as the Common Fund or
NIBIB; (d) increasing NIH’s capacity to part-
ner with industry on the development of
platform technologies, such as use of Other
Transactions authorities; (e) experimen-
tation with different models for funding and
managing research, such as the DARPA
model for recruiting and empowering world-
class program managers; (f) use of incentive
prizes, milestone payments and open innova-
tion techniques; and (g) funding non-profit
research institutes that have an increased
capacity to manage more complex research
projects that require professional scientists,
engineers, and product managers, not just
graduate students and postdoctoral research-
ers. The agreement encourages NIH to en-
gage the research community and industry
as it develops its response to these questions
and options.
Precision Medicine and the Pediatric Popu-
lation.—The agreement recognizes the poten-
tial that precision medicine holds for all
populations, including children, and encour-
ages NIH to prioritize timely and meaningful
enrollment for the pediatric population, in-
cluding healthy children and those with rare
disease, in the All of Us program. The agree-
ment requests an update within 60 days on

the timing for the Special Populations Com-
mittee to provide recommendations regard-
ing the practical considerations of child en-
rollment and data collection involving chil-
dren. Additionally, the agreement directs
that NIH provide an update on plans to en-
sure that the research cohort includes a suf-
ficient number of children to make meaning-
ful studies possible, the target date for en-
rollment to commence and how enrollment
strategies will include input from pediatric
stakeholders across the country with experi-
ence in pediatric clinical trial enrollment.
Rare Diseases.—There is concern with un-
known costs resulting from undiagnosed and
untreated rare diseases. As a result, the
agreement directs GAO to study what is
known about the total impact rare diseases
have on the U.S. economy, including direct
medical costs, non-medical costs, loss of in-
come, and the societal consequence of
undiagnosed and untreated rare disease. No
later than two years after the date of enact-
ment of this Act, GAO shall provide a report
on its findings to the Committees.
Regenerative Medicine.—NIH is encouraged,
in collaboration with FDA and HRSA, to en-
gage experts and stakeholders to define data
types and standards necessary to collect
data and measure outcomes related to regen-
erative cell therapies and conduct real-world
testing through a pilot outcomes database
for regenerative adult cell therapies, includ-
ing products administered under FDA Inves-
tigational New Drug or Investigational De-
vice Exemption protocols.
Spina Bifida.—The agreement encourages
NIA, NIDDK, NICHD, and NINDS to study
the causes and care of the neurogenic blad-
der and kidney disease to improve the qual-
ity of life of children and adults with Spina
Bifida; to support research to address issues
related to the treatment and management of
Spina Bifida and associated secondary condi-
tions, such as hydrocephalus; and to invest
in understanding the myriad co-morbid con-
ditions experienced by individuals with
Spina Bifida, including those associated with
both paralysis and developmental delay. The
agreement supports the specific efforts of
NICHD to understand early human develop-
ment; set the foundation for healthy preg-
nancy, and lifelong wellness of women and
children; and promote the gynecological,
andrological and reproductive health for peo-
ple with Spina Bifida. Additionally, NICHD
is encouraged to identify sensitive time peri-
ods to optimize health interventions; im-
prove health during transition from adoles-
cence to adulthood; and ensure safe and ef-
fective therapeutics and devices.
Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve
Conditions Initiative.—The agreement ap-
plauds NIH for its cross-cutting Simulating
Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions
Initiative and is pleased by the Initiative’s
attention to research that aims to address
gaps in treatments for patients suffering
from gastrointestinal, genitourinary, car-
diac, and other disorders. NIH is encouraged
to work collaboratively across its Institutes
and Centers on innovative ways to expand
treatment options for these often burden-
some conditions.
Temporomandibular Disorders.—For the first
time, the nation’s leaders in health and med-
icine are enlisting experts to review all as-
pects of TMD, generating recommendations
for research, regulation, and policy. To con-
tinue to build on advances in coordinated re-
search and treatment, the agreement asks
OD, as it continues to work with NASEM on
the study, to explore the creation of a NIH
inter-Institute TMD working group and to
report to the Committees within 90 days fol-
lowing the publication of the final report.
Traumatic Brain Injury.—The agreement di-
rects NIH to enhance its research efforts on
alternative treatment methods for TBI and
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in-
cluding hyperbaric oxygen treatment
(HBOT). The agreement encourages NIH to
partner with DoD and VA to research treat-
ment alternatives such as HBOT for veterans
living with PTSD and/or TBI.
Trisomy 21.—The agreement includes
$60,000,000 for support of the Investigation of
Co-Occurring Conditions Across the Lifespan
to Understand Down Syndrome (INCLUDE)
Initiative. It is expected that this multi-
year, trans-NIH research initiative may
yield scientific discoveries that could signifi-
cantly improve the health and quality of life
of individuals with Down syndrome as well
as millions of typical individuals. The agree-
ment requests the Director provide a plan
within 60 days of enactment of this Act that
includes a timeline description of potential
grant opportunities and deadlines for all ex-
pected funding opportunities so that young
investigators and new research institutions
may be further encouraged to explore re-
search in this space. This plan should also
incorporate pipeline research initiatives spe-
cific to Down syndrome.
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.—The agreement
encourages the Director to apply rec-
ommendations from two recent NIH-spon-
sored workshops on Tuberous Sclerosis Com-
plex (TSC): the Neurodevelopmental Dis-
orders Biomarkers Workshop held in Decem-
ber 2017 involving TSC and related
neurodevelopmental disorders to take advan-
tage of biomarker expertise and lessons
learned across disease groups, and the work-
shop entitled Accelerating the Development
of Therapies for Anti-Epileptogenesis and
Disease Modification held in August 2018 for
which TSC is a model disorder with the abil-
ity to diagnose TSC prior to onset of epi-
lepsy.
Urinary Tract Infections.—The agreement
commends NIH for supporting research
across the lifespan to better understand the
genitourinary microbiome, the role of in-
flammation in bladder health, and the im-
pact of these factors in urinary tract infec-
tions (UTIs). NIH should continue research
in the development of new and novel thera-
pies to treat and prevent UTIs, including
small molecule candidates and other ap-
proaches that can disrupt infection and new
antibiotics against extensively drug-resist-
ant bacterial strains. The agreement sup-
ports the development of preventive thera-
pies and new treatment strategies.
Inclusion in Clinical Research.—The agree-
ment directs NIH to fund a NASEM study ex-
amining and quantifying the long-term med-
ical and economic impacts of the inclusion of
women and racial and ethnic minorities in
biomedical research and subsequent
translational work, and has provided
$1,200,000 to fund this effort. NIH is directed
to report to the Committees on this issue
and it should include a review of the existing
research on the long-term economic benefits
of increasing the participation of women and
racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials
and biomedical research, including an anal-
ysis of fiscal implications of inclusion on the
nation’s overall healthcare costs; examine
new programs and interventions in medical
centers that are currently working to in-
crease participation of women of lower socio-
economic status and women who are mem-
bers of racial and ethnic minority groups;
identify programs that are positively ad-
dressing issues of underrepresentation; and
analyze whether and how those programs are
replicable and scalable; and identify more in-
clusive institutional and informational poli-
cies and procedures to improve health out-
comes for racial and ethnic minorities, in-
cluding health referral forms, continuing
education classes, and more.
BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES
The bill includes $225,000,000 from HHS’
Nonrecurring Expenses Fund for buildings
and facilities. The agreement directs NIH to
provide a report with the fiscal year 2021
Congressional Justification describing the
steps it has taken and will take to imple-
ment the recommendations in the 2019
NASEM report Managing the NIH Bethesda
Campus’ Capital Assets in a Highly Competitive
Global Biomedical Research Environment.
There is a particular interest in the actions
NIH is taking to apply the recommendations
to update the Buildings and Facilities
prioritization model, develop an annual
budget request for Backlog of Maintenance
and Repair, and strengthen its internal gov-
ernance process, including assigning and em-
powering a senior leader to manage capital
planning.
In addition, the agreement directs NIH to
provide quarterly briefings of its Buildings
and Facilities maintenance and construction
plans, including specific milestones for ad-
vancing projects, status of the project, cost,
and priority. These updates should also high-
light and explain any potential cost and
schedule changes affecting projects.
SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH
SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (SAMHSA)
The agreement encourages SAMHSA to ex-
ercise maximum flexibility when developing
funding opportunity announcements to en-
sure that all eligible applicants may apply.
MENTAL HEALTH
Certified Community Behavioral Health Clin-
ics.—The agreement includes increased fund-
ing and directs SAMHSA to prioritize re-
sources to entities within States that are
part of the section 223(a) of the Protecting
Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (P.L. 113–93)
demonstration and to entities within States
that were awarded planning grants.
Mental Health.—The agreement directs
SAMHSA to provide a comprehensive plan to
the Committees no later than 60 days after
enactment of this Act identifying current
gaps in mental health care programs, high-
lighting how programs can help close those
gaps, and providing recommendations to
meet the needs of those experiencing mental
illness.
National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative.—
The agreement intends that $13,000,000 is for
a new competitive process to expand support
for universities, hospitals, and community-
based programs, of which at least $4,000,000 is
to be prioritized for mental health services
for unaccompanied alien children. The agree-
ment also provides an additional $2,000,000
for activities authorized under section 582(d)
and (e) of the Public Health Service Act.

The agreement includes funding to provide
grants, as authorized by section 7121 of the
SUPPORT Act (P.L. 115–271), to previous re-
cipients of HRSA Rural Communities Opioid
Response Program Planning Grants that pro-
vide comprehensive treatment and recovery
services in rural communities, including
Tribal communities.
Criminal Justice Activities.—The agreement
prioritizes funding for centers that provide
assistance to those with severe mental
health needs who are at risk of recidivism.
The agreement encourages SAMHSA to
prioritize applications from areas with high
rates of uninsured individuals, poverty, and
substance use disorders.
Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health.—
The agreement includes an increase to fund
additional grants. The agreement continues
to recommend providing grants to entities
such as State agencies, Tribal communities,
and university or medical centers.
Mental Health Awareness Training.—
SAMHSA is directed to include as eligible
grantees local law enforcement agencies, fire
departments, and emergency medical units
with a special emphasis on training for crisis
de-escalation techniques. SAMHSA is also
encouraged to allow training for veterans
and armed services personnel and their fam-
ily members within the Mental Health First
Aid program.
Project AWARE.—The agreement includes
an increase and encourages SAMHSA to ex-
pand the identification of children and youth
in need of mental health services, increase
access to mental health treatment, promote
mental health literacy among teachers and
school personnel, and provide mental health
services in schools and for school aged
youth. Of the amount provided, the agree-
ment directs $10,000,000 for discretionary
grants to support efforts in high-crime, high-
poverty areas and, in particular, commu-
nities that are seeking to address relevant
impacts and root causes of civil unrest, com-
munity violence, and collective trauma.
These grants should maintain the same focus
as fiscal year 2019 grants. The agreement re-
quests a report on progress of grantees 180
days after enactment of this Act.

cludes increased funding to expand and en-
hance access to suicide prevention resources
of the Suicide Lifeline, the Zero Suicide pro-
gram, and Garrett Lee Smith Suicide Pre-
vention Resource Center.
SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT
State Opioid Response Grants.—The agree-
ment includes bill language to make address-
ing stimulant abuse an allowable use of
funds while maintaining the existing for-
mula. The agreement directs SAMHSA to en-
sure funds reach communities and counties
with the greatest unmet need. Additionally,
the agreement urges the Assistant Secretary
to ensure the formula avoids a significant
cliff between States with similar mortality
rates. SAMHSA is also directed to provide
State agencies with technical assistance
concerning how to enhance outreach and di-
rect support to providers and underserved
communities. Consistent with the objective
of Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers,
the agreement encourages long-term care
and support services that dramatically im-
prove outcomes and contribute to best prac-
tices. The agreement notes concern that the
report requested under this heading in fiscal
year 2018 has not been transmitted to the
Committees. In addition, the agreement
urges transmittal of SAMHSA’s evaluation
of the program to the Committees by April
2020. SAMHSA is directed to make such re-
port and evaluation available on SAMHSA’s
website.

a pilot or demonstration program to support
safety net clinics in increasing health lit-
eracy and preventing diabetes, with the goal
of reducing long-term costs.
Diagnostic Errors.—The agreement includes
no less than $3,000,000 for the Partners Ena-
bling Diagnostic Excellence research pro-
gram. Such grants will help establish the in-
cidence of and understanding of factors con-
tributing to diagnostic errors and examine
the association between diagnostic safety
and quality and outcomes such as patient
harms, costs, expenditures, and utilization.
Kratom.—Little research has been done to
date on natural products that are used by
many to treat pain in place of opioids. These
natural plants and substances include
kratom and cannabidiol. The agreement rec-
ommends no less than $1,000,000 for this re-
search and directs AHRQ to make center-
based grants. Such research should lead to
clinical trials in geographic regions which
are among the hardest hit by the opioid cri-
sis.
Malnutrition.—AHRQ is requested to con-
vene a technical expert panel charged with
creating a malnutrition-related readmissions
quality measure to help prevent malnutri-
tion in hospitals.
Primary Care Research.—Congress supports
primary care clinical research and dissemi-
nation as a core function of AHRQ. AHRQ
has proven to be uniquely positioned to sup-
port high-quality primary care clinical and
practice research, especially in rural and un-
derserved areas, where primary care physi-
cians are the main providers of care.
State Primary Care Demonstrations.—Con-
gress understands that a number of States
are taking steps to improve the delivery of
primary care. Congress believes that these
actions could provide a model for primary
care nationally. The agreement includes no
less than $1,000,000 to support a study of
those States’ actions, to be shared with the
Committees.

quests CMS report to the Committees no
later than one year after enactment of this
Act on any evidence of air ambulance base
closures in rural areas which may have af-
fected patients’ access to care, and to con-
sider relevant factors that have affected air
ambulance transportation costs when setting
appropriate air ambulance payments, and
consider whether costs currently align with
payments.
Assistive Technology Act Programs Reutiliza-
tion Program.—The agreement encourages
CMS to support State Medicaid programs in
partnering with State Assistive Technology
Act programs to develop and implement re-
utilization programs with a goal of con-
taining Medicaid costs.
At-risk Youth Medicaid Protection.—The
agreement encourages CMS to consider rule-
making related to section 1001 of the SUP-
PORT for Patients and Communities Act
(P.L. 115–271) and include an update on these
activities in the fiscal year 2021 Congres-
sional Justification.
Certified Community Behavioral Health Clin-
ics.—The agreement directs CMS to provide

ment requests information in the fiscal year
2021 Congressional Justification that pro-
vides options to reform the identification of
Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare
Advantage or Part D plans by third party
payers in situations where no-fault or liabil-
ity insurance, or workers’ compensation is
involved.
Colorectal Cancer Screenings.—The agree-
ment encourages CMS to use its existing au-
thority to increase access to colorectal can-
cer screenings by exploring options to reduce
out-of-pocket costs associated with screen-
ing colonoscopies when a polyp or lesion is
found and removed.
Computed Tomography (CT) Colonography.—
The agreement encourages CMS to consider
existing evidence to determine whether CMS
should cover CT colonography as a Medicare-
covered colorectal cancer screening test
under section 1861(pp)(1) of the Social Secu-
rity Act.
Data Collection Process for Laboratory Test-
ing.—The agreement encourages CMS to con-
tinue to work with laboratory stakeholders
to further refine and evaluate the data col-
lection process under section 216 of the Pro-
tecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (P.L.
113–93) to ensure that the information col-
lected accurately reflects the national lab-
oratory market, including physician office
laboratories and hospital outreach labora-
tories.
Detecting Cognitive Impairment.—The agree-
ment encourages CMS to evaluate and up-
date its definition of the ‘‘detection of any
cognitive impairment’’ element to the An-
nual Wellness Visit with reference to cog-
nitive impairment detection tools available
at NIA’s Alzheimer’s and Dementia Re-
sources for Professionals website and to do
so within one year of enactment of this Act.
Direct and Indirect Remuneration Fees.—The
agreement encourages CMS to work with
stakeholders, including community phar-
macies and beneficiary groups, to develop
standardized performance metrics that can
be adopted to move the Part D program to-
ward better patient outcomes and quality.
Durable Medical Equipment.—The agree-
ment encourages CMS to consider whether
implementation of the next round of com-
petitive acquisition program reforms should
be fully completed before adding ventilator
equipment, supplies, and services to the
competitive bidding program.

tend the time described in section 413.79(e) of
title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, for new
residency programs before a full-time equiv-
alent resident cap is applied as authorized in
P.L. 105–33.
Health Insurance Exchange Transparency.—
The agreement continues bill language re-
quiring CMS to continue to provide cost in-
formation for the health insurance exchange,
including all categories described under this
heading in the explanatory statement ac-
companying division B of P.L. 115–245, as
well as estimated costs for fiscal year 2021.

December 17, 2019
Limited Wraparound Coverage.—The agree-
ment strongly urges CMS to extend the pilot
program established by a final regulation
published on March 18, 2015, to allow limited
wraparound benefits, or supplements, to in-
dividual health insurance coverage (or Basic
Health Plan coverage). Wraparound coverage
is a specialized offering targeted to help
part-time workers and retirees whose em-
ployers or former employers meet standards
of responsibility and have agreed to provide
this supplemental coverage as an option. The
agreement directs the Department to submit
a report within 90 days of enactment of this
Act on the status of the program.
Transparency.—The agreement encourages
the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Inno-
vation to engage with stakeholders and Con-
gress during the project development process
and requests an update on such efforts in the
fiscal year 2021 Congressional Justification.
Lymphatic System Failure.—The agreement
encourages the Secretary to promulgate
rules for covering prescribed compression
garments as acknowledged by CMS’s 2001 de-
cision memorandum in the treatment of
lymphatic system failure.
Medical Claims Databases.—The agreement
urges CMS, in consultation with the Secre-
taries of Labor and Treasury, to, once en-
acted, move swiftly to implement legislation
creating a secure Federal database and sup-
port States in collecting data and claims
that will enable analysis of the utilization
and prices of healthcare items and services.
Medicare Coverage of Innovative Drugs and
Products.—The agreement encourages CMS
to explore different ways to reimburse for in-
novative drugs approved by FDA in a manner
that protects beneficiary access and encour-
ages continued innovation while preserving
the Medicare trust funds.
Medicare Coverage of In-Home Intravenous
Immunoglobulin.—The agreement is aware of
a demonstration evaluating bundled pay-
ment covering items and services needed to
administer intravenous immunoglobulin
(IVIG) into beneficiaries with primary im-
munodeficiency diseases. The agreement is
also aware of ongoing rulemaking pertaining
to the permanent Medicare home infusion
services payment for therapies like IVIG. As
CMS continues with rulemaking for the per-
manent home infusion therapy benefit, the
agreement encourages CMS to articulate
this position in future rulemaking.
Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program.—The
agreement encourages CMS to minimize the
regulatory barriers impeding potential or ex-
isting suppliers from delivering the Diabetes
Prevention Program (DPP) to Medicare
beneficiaries, and to allow the full range of
CDC-recognized DPP providers to participate
as Medicare DPP suppliers.
Medicare Area Wage Index.—The agreement
directs CMS to provide a report to the Com-
mittees on its methodology for calculating
the labor-related share (LRS) percentage
used in the proposed rule entitled ‘‘The Inpa-
tient Prospective Payment System and the

ment System for fiscal year 2020’’. The re-
port shall fully describe all methodologies,
allocations, and assumptions; and provide a
schedule(s) of the calculation used to derive
the LRS percent.
Nonemergency Medical Transportation
(NEMT).—The agreement directs HHS to
take no regulatory action on availability of
NEMT service until the study described
under the ‘‘Medicaid and CHIP Payment and
Access Commission’’ header of this joint ex-
planatory statement is complete.

that CMS has implemented policies that pre-
vent consumers from purchasing stand-alone
dental benefits and encourages CMS to per-
mit the purchase of stand-alone dental plans
separate from the purchase of qualified
health plans beginning with the 2020 plan
year. The agreement encourages CMS to re-
port annually on State-level oral health and
dental benefits available to adult popu-
lations, including pregnant women.
Program Integrity.—The agreement notes
the Committees have yet to receive the
briefing on program integrity requested in
Senate Report 115–289. The agreement re-
quests the briefing from CMS’s Center for
Program Integrity within 60 days of enact-
ment of this Act.
Recovery Audit Program.—The agreement
directs CMS to conduct an internal review of
their Recovery Audit program in an effort to
identify inefficiencies in the current system.
CMS shall include their findings in the an-
nual report to Congress.
Reimbursement Coding for Reducing Opioid
Consumption.—The agreement urges CMS to
collaborate with the FDA and consider ap-
proved devices and therapies for unique post-
surgery patient populations for effective
pain management. In addition, CMS should
take steps to improve tracking of patient
pain scores and opioid consumption using al-
ternative means for effective pain manage-
ment.
Revisions to Office Visit Services.—The agree-
ment notes that the CMS final 2019 Medicare
Physician Fee Schedule rule outlines signifi-
cant changes to how evaluation and manage-
ment services will be documented and paid
for beginning in 2021. The agreement encour-
ages CMS to ensure that payment changes do
not further exacerbate workforce shortages.
Risk Corridor Program.—CMS is directed to
provide a yearly report to the Committees
detailing any changes to the receipt and
transfer of payments.
Robotic Stereotactic Radiosurgery.—The
agreement encourages CMS not to make pay-
ment changes to robotic stereotactic
radiosurgery (SRS) and robotic stereotactic
body radiation therapy (SBRT) in the free-
standing or hospital outpatient setting as
CMS complies with the Patient Access and
Medicare Protection Act and the Bipartisan
Budget Act of 2018. The agreement encour-
ages CMS to maintain stable payment for
robotic SRS and robotic SBRT performed in
Core-Based Statistical Areas that are not
randomly selected to participate in the al-
ternative payment model.
Rural Healthcare Facilities.—The agreement
encourages CMS to continue working with
States and State hospital associations on al-
ternative payment models for rural medical
centers that support future financial sta-
bility and announce potential models in 2020
with participants who demonstrate clear
community support for engaging these new
programmatic flexibilities.
Telehealth.—To address inconsistency with
billing and coding across Medicaid, the
agreement encourages CMS to issue guid-
ance outlining a recommended, but vol-
untary, set of billing codes, modifiers and/or
place of service designations for use in State
Medicaid programs.
Therapeutic Foster Care.—The agreement
requests an update in the fiscal year 2021
Congressional Justification on the study re-
quested in House Report 114–699.
Underperforming Healthcare Facilities.—
Within six months of enactment of this Act,
the agreement directs CMS to provide the
Committees a report on the resources the
agency requires to ensure all nominees for
the program become full participants, sub-
ject to the special focus facility (SFF) pro-
gram’s enhanced surveying and progressive
enforcement standards. The agreement fur-
ther directs CMS to disclose the names of
nursing homes that are eligible for the SFF
program, but are not officially part of SFF,
on the Nursing Home Compare website.
Workforce Capacity for Infectious Diseases
and the Opioid Epidemic.—The agreement
continues to encourage CMS to collaborate
with SAMHSA, CDC, and HRSA to support
education and training for medical providers
on the frontlines of the opioid epidemic to
help expand access to comprehensive, coordi-
nated care for opioid addiction and related
infectious diseases.
ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES
(ACF)
LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE
The agreement includes a new provision
limiting annual decreases in State alloca-
tions, preventing States from receiving less
than 97 percent of what they received the
prior fiscal year.

the agreement directs ACF to submit to the
Committees and make publicly available a
report evaluating the program’s formula and
allocations of funding among States, includ-
ing an assessment of available data, how the
formula currently addresses annual fluctua-
tions in formula factors, and the percentage
of eligible households served, average assist-
ance amount, and percentage of home energy
costs covered by that amount by State.
REFUGEE AND ENTRANT ASSISTANCE
The agreement notes that appropriate con-
sultation with Congress is required by stat-
ute in advance of the Administration’s deter-
mination on the number of refugees to be ad-
mitted during the coming fiscal year. In
times of reductions in refugee arrivals, the
agreement encourages HHS, to the extent
practicable, to ensure that resettlement
agencies can maintain their infrastructure
and capacity at a level to continue to serve
all refugees and to ensure future arrivals are
adequately served. The agreement strongly
encourages the Office of Refugee Resettle-
ment (ORR) to continue to meet, on no less
than a bi-monthly basis, with outside organi-
zations with expertise in ORR programs to
provide updates and hear the perspective of
these stakeholders.

pended funding and slots when justified, in-
cluding by providing exemptions to the 31
day enrollment period.
Refugee Support Services.—Within 30 days of
enactment of this Act, the agreement directs
the Department to provide a list of competi-
tive grants and set-asides within Refugee
Support Services and to include their cor-
responding funding levels in fiscal years 2016
through 2020.

Children Separated from a Parent or Legal
Guardian.—The agreement includes a public
reporting requirement with respect to chil-
dren who have been separated from a parent
or legal guardian. In addition, the agreement
notes HHS has not yet complied with the re-
porting requirements included in Senate Re-
port 115–289 regarding the demographics of
separated children and expects the Depart-
ment to begin providing this information.

to the extent possible, to provide culturally
competent, in person education and trans-
lation services to children in custody.
Length of Care.—The agreement directs
ORR to provide a briefing to the Committees
within 120 days of enactment of this Act on
options and plans for children who have been
in ORR custody for extended periods of time.
In addition, ORR is directed to continue to
prioritize case management services and
staffing, including Federal Field Specialists,
lowering the ratio of children per case coor-
dinator.
The agreement includes language con-
tinuing current law regarding the oper-
ational directives issued to modify sponsor
suitability requirements, which significantly
reduced the length of time children spend in
care. The agreement expects HHS to con-
tinue to work on efforts to reduce time in
care and to consider additional policy
changes that can be made to release children
to suitable sponsors as safely and expedi-
tiously as possible. The agreement does not
provide further direction on this issue.

resources necessary to support children and
families who may need access to these serv-
ices. In addition, the agreement directs ORR
to provide a briefing to the Committees
within 120 days of enactment of this Act on
HHS’ and grantees’ coordination of health
and mental health services, including train-
ing requirements for staff providing those
services and any challenges to providing ade-
quate care for children.
New Models of Care Delivery.—ORR is urged
to include in the fiscal year 2021 Congres-
sional Justification information about any
plans being considered for new models of
care delivery, along with a justification for
how new models could best meet the needs of
children in ORR care. When exploring the
feasibility of such models, ORR is expected
to prioritize community engagement, the use
of pilot projects with short-term duration to
demonstrate proof of concept before making
significant or long-term investments, and a
collaborative and transparent communica-
tions strategy with external stakeholders
and Congress.
Office of Inspector General Report Rec-
ommendations.—The agreement requests an
update in the fiscal year 2021 Congressional
Justification on the status of ORR’s imple-
mentation of recommendations made in re-
cent inspector general reports.
Records Requests.—The agreement expects
ORR to maintain records and respond to
records requests consistent with the require-
ments of section 552 of title 5, U.S. Code, for
information related to all children in care,
regardless of whether such children are
housed in Federal facilities or, to the extent
possible, non-Federal facilities managed by
contractors or other private entities.
Services for Children.—The agreement in-
cludes an increase in funding for legal serv-
ices, child advocates, and post-release serv-
ices to support the expansion of State-li-
censed shelters, and to allow for the resump-
tion and expansion of services to children re-
leased from ORR care. Using funds provided
in this agreement, combined with funding
from the Emergency Supplemental Appro-
priations for Humanitarian Assistance and
Security at the Southern Border Act, 2019
(P.L. 116–26), ORR is directed to continue to
expand such services beyond currently esti-
mated levels, including for children released
in high-release communities.
The agreement strongly encourages ORR
to notify legal service providers at the time
new grant awards are made and prior to
opening a shelter, and to provide monthly es-
timates of funded capacity by shelter. Addi-
tionally, the agreement strongly encourages
ORR to ensure that all UAC shelters provide
space for legal service providers to meet
with children.
Within amounts provided for post-release
services in this agreement and combined
with funds from P.L 116–26, ORR is directed
to expand post-release services capacity to
eliminate the waitlist of children qualifying
for Trafficking Victims Protection Reau-
thorization Act-mandated services, and to
expand services to children that case man-
agers identify would benefit from such serv-
ices.
Sibling Placement.—The agreement directs
ORR to place siblings in the same facility, or
with the same sponsor, to the extent prac-
ticable, and so long as it is appropriate and
in the best interest of the child.
Spend Plan.—The agreement directs ORR
to incorporate all funding provided in this
Act into a comprehensive spend plan that
must be submitted to the Committees every
60 days in accordance with section 410 of the
Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for
Humanitarian Assistance and Security at
the Southern Border Act, 2019 (P.L. 116–26).
Sponsorship Suitability Determination Proc-
ess.—The Department is directed to ensure
all grantees are provided clear guidance to
communicate with potential sponsors re-
garding current law regarding the use of per-
sonal information collected as part of the
sponsor suitability determination process.
The agreement expects consistent moni-
toring to ensure program policies are applied
appropriately by all grantees in an effort to
place children with sponsors as safely and
expeditiously as practicable.
State Licensed Shelters.—The agreement di-
rects ORR to prioritize licensed, community-
based residential care placements (including
long-term and transitional foster care and
small group homes) over large-scale institu-
tions and to notify the Committees prior to
all new funding opportunity announcements,
grant or contract awards, or plans to lease or
acquire property. Such notification should
include associated timelines and costs.
Temporary Influx Shelters.—The agreement
includes language continuing current law
conditions on the use of temporary influx
shelters, strengthens oversight and moni-
toring of facilities, and requires Congres-
sional notifications and reporting require-
ments if a shelter is operationalized. The
agreement requests HHS submit a report to
the Committees within 90 days of enactment
of this Act detailing the barriers to State-li-
censing, including any State child welfare
laws and regulations, that could not be met
for any influx facility operational in fiscal
year 2019. If an influx shelter is opened in fis-
cal year 2020, ORR shall submit a report to
the Committees with the same information
within 90 days. In addition, the agreement
notes that the spend plan required every 60
days must include a detailed cost breakdown
of any facility, regardless of its operational
status.
Tender Age Children.—The agreement di-
rects ORR to include in the fiscal year 2021
Congressional Justification information on
efforts to ensure developmentally appro-
priate care for tender age children, including
placement options, services and staff train-
ing, as well as an assessment of cir-
cumstances under which very young children
are referred to ORR.
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES SERVICES PROGRAMS
Early Head Start Expansion (EHS) and EHS–
Child Care Partnerships.—The agreement
modifies bill language to simplify the admin-
istration of EHS Expansion and EHS–Child
Care Partnerships (EHS–CCP) grants, but
does not otherwise change the use of funds
provided for such purposes. The agreement
continues to strongly support EHS Expan-
sion and EHS–CCPs, and accordingly, the
agreement includes at least $905,000,000 for
such purposes, an increase of $100,000,000.
Since fiscal year 2014, these funds have sup-
ported both the expansion of traditional EHS
and the establishment of partnerships be-
tween EHS providers and local child care
programs. The agreement directs ACF to
continue to prioritize equally EHS Expan-
sion and EHS–CCP, as determined by the
needs of local communities. The agreement
expects that any funds used for EHS Expan-
sion and EHS–Child Care-Partnership grants
that are re-competed would continue to be
used for such purposes. Finally, the agree-
ment directs ACF to include in the fiscal

rise of adverse childhood experiences attrib-
utable to increased prevalence of substance
use, economic hardship, home and commu-
nity violence, and other traumatic experi-
ences that can negatively impact child de-
velopment and lead to disruptions in class-
room environments. The agreement directs
the Administration to allow flexibility to
meet local needs while focusing these funds
on staff training for trauma-informed care
and identification of signs of addiction and
hardship; mental health consultation serv-
ices to provide expert care and counseling to
families and the Head Start workforce; and
additional staffing to Head Start classes in
high-risk substance use communities to
maintain high-quality learning environ-
ments while providing individualized care to
children expressing disruptive and chal-
lenging behaviors.

TITLE III
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS
Homeless Children and Youth.—The Depart-
ment implemented a reorganization of of-
fices which in part altered the administra-
tion of the McKinney-Vento program, re-
cently strengthened in the reauthorization
of the Elementary and Secondary Education
Act (ESEA). The Department shall brief the
Committees no later than 60 days after en-
actment of this Act on the resources cur-
rently being devoted to monitoring compli-
ance with ESEA accountability and State
and local report card provisions related to
homeless children and youth and supporting
State educational agencies (SEA) and local
educational agencies (LEA) in achieving and
maintaining compliance with such provi-
sions; the internal support within other pro-
gram offices in the Department being pro-
vided to assist with administration of the
Education for Homeless Children and Youth
(EHCY) program; and the resources available
for monitoring compliance with EHCY pro-
gram requirements at the SEA and LEA
level.
Education for Native Hawaiians.—The agree-
ment includes sufficient funding for the Na-
tive Hawaiian Education Council.
Alaska Native Education Equity.—The De-
partment is directed to make every effort to
ensure that grants are awarded well in ad-
vance of the school year, to maximize grant-
ees’ ability to hire the necessary staff and
have their programs in place by the start of
Alaska’s school year in mid-August. The De-
partment is directed to ensure that Alaska
Native Tribes, Alaska Native regional non-
profits, and Alaska Native corporations have
the maximum opportunity to compete suc-
cessfully for grants under this program by
providing these entities multiple opportuni-
ties for technical assistance in developing
successful applications for these funds, both
in Alaska and through various forms of tele-
communications. Finally, the Department is
encouraged to include as many peer review-
ers as possible who have experience with
Alaska Native education and Alaska gen-
erally on each peer review panel.
Student Support and Academic Enrichment
(SSAE) Grants.—The Department should ex-
amine State and local expenditures, outlined
by specific authorized activities, and provide
information about the most common uses of
funds, as well as information about how
LEAs plan to evaluate the effectiveness of
their activities. The Department also should
study how SEAs are collecting data from
LEAs, including how States are verifying
that funds are being used in an authorized
manner and, as applicable, in accordance
with required comprehensive needs assess-
ments, and that LEAs are meeting the objec-
tives and outcomes described in their appli-
cations. The Department should publish re-
ports on these studies publicly and is encour-
aged to conduct such studies periodically as
appropriate. Finally, the agreement does not
provide direction regarding guidance on al-
lowable uses of funds.
SSAE Technical Assistance and Capacity
Building.—The agreement expects funds re-
served for technical assistance and capacity
building to be used strictly to support SEAs
and LEAs in carrying out authorized activi-
ties under this program. In the fiscal year
2021 Congressional Justification, the Depart-
ment shall provide current and planned ex-
penditures, and include a plan for how re-
sources will be spent to build the capacity of
SEAs and LEAs and provide technical assist-
ance. The plan should include how resources
will be spent helping SEAs and LEAs vet evi-
dence, implement evidence-based interven-
tions, and incorporate evidence-based SSAE
activities into school improvement strate-
gies.
INDIAN EDUCATION
National Activities.—Within the total, the
agreement includes no less than $2,811,000 for
Native American language immersion pro-
grams authorized under section 6133 of
ESEA. These funds should be allocated to all
types of eligible entities, including both new
and existing language immersion programs
and schools, to support the most extensive
possible geographical distribution and lan-
guage diversity. Further, the Department is
directed to give the same consideration to
applicants that propose to provide partial
immersion schools and programs as to full
immersion, as the local Tribes, schools, and
other applicants know best what type of pro-
gram will most effectively assist their youth
to succeed.
Special Programs for Indian Children.—The
President’s budget request includes up to
$10,000,000 to expand the ability of families to
choose high-quality educational opportuni-
ties to meet the needs of Native youth. The
Department shall only pursue this initiative
if supported by Tribes after Tribal consulta-
tion. Accordingly, the Department is di-
rected to include information on the planned
use of funds under the Special Programs for
Indian Children program in the operating
plan required under section 516 of this Act,
and to brief the Committees not less than 30
days prior to posting any notice inviting ap-
plications under this program.
INNOVATION AND IMPROVEMENT
Education Innovation and Research (EIR).—
Within the total for EIR, the agreement in-
cludes $65,000,000 to provide grants for social
and emotional learning (SEL). Within 90
days of enactment of this Act, the Depart-
ment is directed to brief the Committees on
plans for carrying out the SEL competition.
In addition, the Department shall provide
notice to the Committees at least seven days
before grantees are announced.
In addition, within the total for EIR, the
agreement includes $65,000,000 for Science,
Technology, Education, and Math (STEM)
and computer science education activities.
This could also include grants to SEAs, in-
cluding in partnership with non-profit orga-
nizations, for State-led efforts to implement,
replicate, or expand Statewide professional
development programs. Within the STEM
and computer science set-aside, awards
should expand opportunities for underrep-
resented students such as minorities, girls,
and youth from families living at or below
the poverty line to help reduce the enroll-
ment and achievement gap. The agreement
supports the Department’s prioritization of
computer science education in fiscal year
2019 EIR grant competitions and the Depart-
ment should continue this in fiscal year 2020.
Grant Priorities.—There is significant de-
mand from the field to test many types of
strategies and to examine promising tech-
niques that can be scaled-up in different set-
tings. EIR should continue to support di-
verse and field-initiated interventions. The
Department is directed to brief the Commit-
tees on the fiscal year 2020 funding opportu-
nities available under this program, includ-
ing any specified priorities, not less than 30
days prior to releasing a notice inviting ap-
plications.
Rural Set-Aside.—The Department is en-
couraged to take steps necessary to ensure
the set-aside is met and that EIR funds are
awarded to diverse geographic areas.
Charter Schools Program.—The agreement
includes $140,000,000 for replicating and ex-
panding high-quality charter school models;
$225,000,000 for grants to State entities to
support high-quality charter schools; and
$60,000,000 for facilities financing assistance,
of which not less than $50,000,000 shall be for
the Credit Enhancement program. In addi-
tion, the agreement continues support for
developer grants to establish or expand char-
ter schools in underserved, high-poverty,
rural areas, as referenced in the joint explan-
atory statement accompanying P.L. 115–245.
Arts in Education.—The agreement provides
funding for each activity within this pro-
gram at no less than the fiscal year 2019
level.
Ready to Learn.—In addition to language in
House Report 116–62, the Department should
refrain from making changes to the Ready to
Learn program that would impede or impair
production and nationwide distribution of
television content, digital content, and sup-
plemental materials through local public
telecommunications entities.
Supporting Effective Educator Development
(SEED).—Within SEED, the Department is
directed to support professional development
that helps educators incorporate SEL prac-
tices into teaching, and to support pathways
into teaching that provide a strong founda-
tion in child development and learning, in-
cluding skills for implementing SEL strate-
gies in the classroom. Within 90 days of en-
actment of this Act, the Department is di-
rected to brief the Committees on plans for
supporting SEL within SEED. In addition,
the Department shall provide notice to the
Committees at least seven days before grant-
ees are announced.
In addition, the SEED program is an ideal
vehicle for helping ensure that more highly
trained school leaders are available to serve
in traditionally underserved LEAs. There-
fore, the Secretary shall use a portion of
funds made available for SEED to support
the preparation of principals and other
school leaders.
Finally, students in rural public schools
and public schools serving high percentages
of Native students have particularly inequi-
table access to accomplished teachers. The
Department should strongly consider estab-
lishing a priority for SEED projects address-
ing this issue and to increase the number of
teachers in such schools who have earned a
nationally recognized advanced credential.
SAFE SCHOOLS AND CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION
Promise Neighborhoods.—The agreement in-
cludes $6,000,000 for additional extension
awards for grantees that received extension
grants in fiscal year 2018 and have dem-
onstrated positive and promising results.
This funding is intended to support the final
phase-out of Federal support.
School Safety National Activities.—For fiscal
year 2020, $10,000,000 is provided for awards to
SEAs, LEAs, or consortia of LEAs to in-
crease the number of qualified, well-trained

counselors, social workers, psychologists, or
other mental health professionals that pro-
vide school-based mental health services to
students. To promote the sustainability of
these services, the Secretary shall require
that awards include a 25 percent match from
grantees and require that the awards do not
supplant existing mental health funding.
Within 90 days of enactment of this Act, the
Department is directed to brief the Commit-
tees on plans for carrying out the competi-
tion. In addition, the Department shall pro-
vide notice to the Committees at least seven
days before grantees are announced.
The Department is also directed to con-
tinue a demonstration project initiated in
fiscal year 2019 to test and evaluate innova-
tive partnerships to train school-based men-
tal health professionals.
Demonstration projects and competitions
to train and increase the number of school-
based mental health professionals support
the implementation of trauma-informed
practices and other mental health supports
in schools. Fostering trauma-informed cul-
tures in schools helps both students and staff
succeed by addressing the impacts of trau-
ma; improves school capacity to identify,
refer, and provide services to students; can
improve staff retention and help keep stu-
dents in school; and support learning envi-
ronments where students feel safe, sup-
ported, and ready to learn.
Opioid Substance Use Disorder and Preven-
tion.—The Department has implemented a
priority in grant competitions for projects
addressing opioid substance use disorder and
prevention. More must be done to prevent
opioid substance use disorder by students
and address the mental health needs of stu-
dents affected by opioid substance use dis-
order in their families or communities.
Project SERV.—The Department should en-
sure that funding made available for Project
SERV grants is promptly awarded to eligible
entities located in areas with high rates of
community violence to restore any learning
environment that was disrupted by a violent
or traumatic crisis.
School Safety and Climate.—The Depart-
ment is encouraged to partner with outside
experts and other Federal agencies as appro-
priate to develop best-practices to improve
school safety and school climate.
State and Federal Coordination on School
Safety and Climate.—Many States have re-
searched and in some cases provided reports
on the local needs and solutions to maintain
safe and welcoming school climates. The De-
partment is encouraged to review such re-
ports and support SEAs, as authorized in
ESEA.
School Safety Clearinghouse and Mental
Health Services for Students.—The Department
is directed to brief the Committees within 90
days of enactment of this Act on: (1) the
progress made by the Department in identi-
fying, assessing, and disseminating evidence-
based approaches to maintaining safe schools
and positive learning environments for all
students, including establishing a clearing-
house for such approaches; and (2) improving
and expanding access to mental health serv-
ices for students.
ENGLISH LANGUAGE ACQUISITION
The Department is encouraged to help
SEAs and LEAs make the best use of funding
within this program and other Department
programs to support English learners.
SPECIAL EDUCATION
Education Materials in Accessible Formats for
Students with Visual Impairments.—The agree-
ment provides an increase of $500,000 and rec-
ognizes the ongoing progress made with the
tools and services provided under Edu-
cational Technology, Media, and Materials
that have allowed more than 620,000 students
with disabilities free access to more than
700,000 books in digitally accessible formats.
The Department is encouraged to continue
to expand this program’s reach to K–12 stu-
dents in underserved areas.
Promoting Development of Social Skills for
Students with Disabilities.—Within the total
for Educational Technology, Media, and Ma-
terials, the agreement includes $1,000,000 for
a demonstration project to facilitate the de-
velopment of new educational strategies and
programming for students with disabilities
who could benefit from social skills instruc-
tion. This should include utilizing new tech-
nologies and evidence-based curriculums in
instructional settings, including advanced
social robotics that integrate evidence-based
practices to improve social skills and gen-
erate positive educational outcomes in stu-
dents with disabilities.
Medicaid Services.—Opportunities exist to
streamline access to and improve the quality
of special education services, and steps
should be taken to reduce administrative
barriers for providing health services in and
in coordination with schools. The Office of
Special Education and Rehabilitative Serv-
ices should coordinate with the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services to develop
training and provide technical assistance to
assist with billing and payment administra-
tion for Medicaid services in schools.
Special Olympics.—Within the total for
Technical Assistance and Dissemination, the
agreement includes $20,083,000, an increase of
$2,500,000 above the fiscal year 2019 funding
level, to support activities authorized by the
Special Olympics Sport and Empowerment
Act, including Project UNIFY.
REHABILITATION SERVICES
Vocational Rehabilitation State Grants.—The
agreement directs the Secretary to submit a
report within 90 days of enactment of this
Act to the Committees evaluating any
changes in trends in employment outcomes
for individuals with disabilities served by
State vocational rehabilitation programs be-
fore and after the implementation of the
WIOA. The agreement directs the Secretary
to ensure appropriate State level implemen-
tation of the Rehabilitation Act, which may
include the Department providing technical
assistance as necessary.
SPECIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR PERSONS WITH
DISABILITIES
American Printing House for the Blind.—The
agreement includes $2,000,000, an increase of

partnership established in fiscal year 2019.
National Technical Institute for the Deaf.—
The agreement includes $5,500,000 to con-
tinue the National Technical Institute for
the Deaf’s (NTID) existing regional partner-
ship in fiscal year 2020, intended to expand
NTID’s geographical reach and improve ac-
cess to postsecondary STEM education and
employment for students who are deaf or
hard of hearing in underserved areas.
Gallaudet University.—The agreement in-
cludes $3,000,000, an increase of $1,000,000, to
continue the regional partnership estab-
lished in fiscal year 2019 focused on early
language acquisition for children from birth
through age three who are deaf or hard of
hearing.
CAREER, TECHNICAL, AND ADULT EDUCATION
The Department is encouraged to establish
the on-line portal for career and technical
education students described in section
114(e)(7)(K) of the Carl D. Perkins Career and
Technical Education Act.
The Department is encouraged to work
with the Departments of Defense, Labor, and
Commerce to develop a pilot project to in-
crease the quality of and participation in ca-
reer and technical education programs that
would help develop the skilled workforce
needed for new submarine construction.
STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
Pell Grants.—The agreement increases the
maximum award by $150, to $6,345 in aca-
demic year 2020–2021.
Federal Work Study.—Within the total for
Federal Work Study, the agreement includes
$10,051,000, for the Work Colleges program
authorized under section 448 of the Higher
Education Act (HEA).
FEDERAL DIRECT STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM
ACCOUNT
The Department shall brief the Commit-
tees of jurisdiction within 45 days of enact-
ment of this Act on actions planned or
taken: (1) to address and implement rec-
ommendations outlined in a GAO report ti-
tled ‘‘Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Improv-
ing the Temporary Expanded Process Could
Help Reduce Borrower Confusion’’ (GAO–19–
595); (2) to simplify the Temporary Expanded
Public Service Loan Forgiveness (TEPSLF)
application process so borrowers can apply
for TEPSLF at the same time as they apply
for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF);
(3) to provide more information to borrowers
denied TEPSLF on the reason for the denial;
(4) to conduct outreach to borrowers who
may be eligible for TEPSLF; and (5) to im-
prove administration of the PSLF program,
including by implementing GAO’s rec-
ommendations for that program.
STUDENT AID ADMINISTRATION
Ability to Benefit.—The Department shall
issue guidance that serves as a simple and
clear resource for implementing Ability to
Benefit at IHEs, which should restate the up-
dated definition of a career pathway program
and contain answers to frequently asked
questions about program eligibility.
Student Loan Servicing.— The agreement in-
cludes $1,768,943,000 for Student Aid Adminis-
tration. The Department has stated that the
implementation of the Next Generation
Servicing Environment (Next Gen) will ad-
dress problems with the current student loan
servicing environment and improve account-
ability and services for students, borrowers
and families. However, full implementation
of Next Gen will take several years. In the
interim, the Department should continue to
take steps to improve the current servicing
environment.
In addition to continuing statutory re-
quirements from fiscal year 2019, the agree-
ment includes new provisions directing the
Department to hold servicers accountable for
high-quality outcomes, noncompliance with
Federal Student Aid (FSA) guidelines, con-
tract requirements (e.g., an understanding of
Federal and State law), and applicable laws,
including misinformation provided to bor-
rowers. In addition to provisions ensuring
accountability and high-quality service from
student loan servicers, the agreement also
includes a new provision ensuring similar ex-
pectations, as applicable, for all of FSA’s
contractors. As part of this effort, it is ex-
pected that FSA will monitor performance
and service delivery at the point of contact
between contractors and borrowers, as appli-
cable, to ensure such accountability and
high-quality service.
The Department should ensure, consistent
with current statutory requirements, that
the transition to Next Gen, including the En-
hanced Processing Solution, does not rely on
a single-servicer model. In addition to the di-
rectives in House Report 116-62, the agree-
ment directs FSA to provide a detailed stra-
tegic plan for Next Gen to the Committees
within 180 days of enactment of this Act, ac-
counting for the cost of all activities associ-
ated with the full implementation of Next

duct semiannual briefings to the authorizing
and Appropriations Committees.
The agreement directs the Department to
continue to provide to the Committees quar-
terly reports detailing its obligation plan by
quarter for student aid administrative ac-
tivities broken out by servicer, Next Gen
contractor and activity and detailing per-
formance metrics, total loan volume and
number of accounts, broken out by servicer,
Next Gen contractor and for each private
collection agency.
Free Application for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA) Simplification and Data Linkages.—
The agreement supports efforts to further
simplify the FAFSA and verification process
to reduce the burden on students and IHEs,
including swift implementation of recent
legislative changes to the sharing of infor-
mation between the Department and Inter-
nal Revenue Service and ensuring all service
members and veterans can identify their sta-
tus when they apply for student aid separate
from the dependency determination.
Return of Title IV Funds.—The Department
is encouraged to pursue efforts to simplify
and streamline the return of title IV funds
process for IHEs and students.
Student Aid Enforcement.—The Department
shall include information in its fiscal year
2021 Congressional Justification on staffing
levels of the Student Aid Enforcement Unit
and actions taken by the unit, including the
number and type of actions opened, pending,
and closed annually.
Student Loan Cancellations and Discharges
Reporting.—The Department should continue
to bolster transparency through the Federal
Student Aid Data Center by supplementing
current reporting with, at a minimum, semi-
annual reports beginning no later than 90
days after enactment of this Act, on each of
the Federal student loan cancellation and
discharge programs. Each report should in-
clude the total number of unique borrowers
who have applied for a program or have been
identified under an applicable data match
(‘‘borrowers’’), unique borrowers in each ap-
plicable status (received, pending, approved,
and denied), total loan balance in each appli-
cable status (received, pending, approved,
and denied), median amount discharged for
each program, and percentage of unique bor-
rowers subject to any partial discharge. The
Department should publish disaggregated in-
formation by State, as possible, and make
such information available publicly on the
Department’s website.
Total and Permanent Disability.—The agree-
ment directs the Department to provide a re-
port to the Committees within 180 days of
enactment of this Act on steps taken or
planned to be taken to improve information
provided to students who are eligible for
total and permanent disability discharge of
Federal student loans or service obligations,
including strategies used to improve out-
reach to all eligible borrowers and increase
the number of qualifying individuals receiv-
ing discharges.
Veterans Affairs Data Matching.—The Sec-
retary shall provide a report not later than
90 days after enactment of this Act to the
Committees on the implementation of the
data matching system with the Department
of Veterans Affairs to facilitate the dis-
charge of student loans for veterans with
total and permanent disabilities. Such report
should include information about the num-
ber of veterans identified through the match-
ing program, the number of loans automati-
cally discharged as the result of the match-
ing program, the number of loans discharged
overall, and a description of the barriers for
veterans who may be eligible for a student
loan discharge for total and permanent dis-
ability but who have not received one, and
planned actions for eliminating such barriers
for veterans.
HIGHER EDUCATION
Aid for Institutional Development
Strengthening Institutions.—The Depart-
ment is encouraged to support programs at
Institutions of Higher Education (IHE) that
offer training programs that lead to certifi-
cates or industry-recognized credentials in
high-demand fields; provide educational ex-
periences that are closely aligned to actual
workforce needs; provide customizable and
quality educational opportunities; and con-
nect students to comprehensive educational
offerings that provide students with other
essential skills.
Postsecondary Programs for Students with In-
tellectual Disabilities
The agreement includes $11,800,000 to carry
out activities under title VII, part D, sub-
parts 2 and 4 of the HEA. Funds will be used
by the Department to hold a new competi-
tion to build on the important work that has
been done to develop postsecondary opportu-
nities for students with intellectual disabil-
ities through model projects and the Na-
tional Coordinating Center (NCC), and to ex-
pand the work of the NCC to conduct re-
search to identify effective strategies used
by postsecondary programs for students with
intellectual disabilities that lead to positive
employment and independent living out-
comes.
Federal TRIO Programs
The Department is directed to allocate any
grant funding not needed for non-competi-
tive continuation awards or for programs up
for re-competition in fiscal year 2020 to pro-
vide inflationary increases for current grant-
ees and to increase the number and size of
new awards in the Student Support Services
grant competition. The Department is fur-
ther directed to include proposed funding
levels for each of the TRIO programs in the
operating plan required under section 516 of
this Act. There is great concern and dis-
appointment that the Department has yet to
issue a notice inviting applications for new
awards for TRIO Student Support Services
grants. The Department is directed to pub-
lish such notice inviting applications for new
awards for TRIO Student Support Services
grants no later than December 30, 2019 and
take steps necessary to award funding as
early as possible before the beginning of the
academic year.
Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for
Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP)
The agreement notes concerns over the
competition schedule for GEAR UP State
and partnership grants. The agreement di-
rects the Department to uphold the long-
standing guidance that States may only ad-
minister one active State grant at a time.
The Secretary is directed to provide written
guidance in the Federal Register notifying
applicants that only States without an ac-
tive State grant, or States that have an ac-
tive State grant that is scheduled to end
prior to October 1, 2020, will be eligible to re-
ceive a new State award funded in whole or
in part by this appropriation. The agreement
directs the Department to provide a briefing
to the Committees within 90 days of enact-
ment of this Act on this program and any
planned competitions for fiscal year 2020.
Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary
Education
The agreement includes $24,500,000 for
FIPSE, to remain available through Decem-
ber 31, 2020, for the following activities.
Career Pathways.—The agreement includes
$10,000,000 for grants to expand and improve
career pathways opportunities for students
beginning in high school. These grants

ance systems that promote multiple path-
ways to postsecondary and career success.
Centers of Excellence for Veterans Student
Success Program.—The agreement includes
$7,000,000 for the activity described under the
heading ‘‘Fund for the Improvement of Postsec-
ondary Education’’ and as set out in the para-
graphs associated with the Centers of Excel-
lence for Veterans Student Success Program
in House Report 116–62.
Open Textbook Pilot.—The agreement in-
cludes $7,000,000 to continue the Open Text-
book Pilot and fund a new grant competition
in fiscal year 2020. The Department shall
issue a notice inviting applications con-
sistent with notice and comment procedures
and allow for a 60-day application period.
This funding should support a significant
number of grant awards to IHEs as defined
by 20 U.S.C. 1001, a group of IHEs, or State
higher education agencies that lead the ac-
tivities of (and serve as fiscal agent for) a
consortium. Funding should be used to cre-
ate new open textbooks and expand the use
of open textbooks in courses that are part of
a degree granting program, and particularly
those with high enrollments. Allowable uses
of funds should include professional develop-
ment for faculty and staff, including relating
to the search for and review of open text-
books; the creation or adaptation of open
textbooks; development or improvement of
tools and informational resources that sup-
port the use of open textbooks, including ac-
cessible instructional materials for students
with disabilities; and research evaluating the
efficacy of the use of open textbooks for
achieving savings for students and the im-
pact on instruction and student learning
outcomes. The Secretary shall require that
any open textbooks created with these funds
shall be released to the public under a non-
exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, and irrev-
ocable license to exercise any of the rights
under copyright conditioned only on the re-
quirement that attribution be given as di-
rected by the copyright owner. Further, any
tools, technologies, or other resources that
are created, developed, or improved wholly
or in part with these funds for use with any
open textbook must be similarly licensed.
Any eligible entity receiving a grant through
the Open Textbooks Pilot, upon completion
of the supported project, shall report to the
Secretary regarding the effectiveness of the
project in expanding the use of open text-
books and in achieving savings for students;
the impact of the project on expanding the
use of open textbooks at IHEs outside of the
institution receiving the grant; open text-
books created or adapted under the grant, in-
cluding instructions on where the public can
access each open textbook; the impact of the
project on instruction and student learning
outcomes; and all project costs, including
the value of any volunteer labor and institu-
tional capital used for the project. The Sec-
retary shall make such reports publicly
available.
National Center for Information and Tech-
nical Support for Postsecondary Students with
Disabilities.—The agreement includes $500,000

accurately reflects those needs and con-
tinues all current loan deferments. The
agreement includes additional funding and
new bill language for the deferment of out-
standing loans for public HBCUs. Further,
the agreement directs the Department to
provide such funding based on the quality of
applications received and to prorate funds
across all eligible schools.
INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION SCIENCES (IES)
Assessment.—The agreement supports as-
sessments for students in United States His-
tory and Civics. The National Assessment
Governing Board (NAGB) is directed to con-
tinue administering assessments in these
two areas, at least every 4 years, in accord-
ance with the current National Assessment
of Educational Progress (NAEP) schedule.
The agreement notes concern with recent
changes to the proposed NAEP schedule,
some of which differ from the schedule out-
lined in the fiscal year 2020 budget request,
which proposed a reduction in funding for as-
sessments that is part of the explanation for
the modified assessment schedule. The De-
partment and NAGB are directed to provide
a briefing to the Committees within 45 days
of enactment of this Act on the proposed
changes and estimated funding needed to
maintain the schedule outlined in the fiscal
year 2020 budget request.
Second Chance Pell.—The agreement directs
IES to conduct a rigorous evaluation of the
Second Chance Pell Experiment as an-
nounced in the Federal Register (Volume 80,
Number 148 on Monday, August 3, 2015) and
work with the Department’s Policy and Pro-
gram Studies on this effort. The agreement
directs IES to submit the evaluation to the
Committees within 30 days of completing the
evaluation. The agreement also directs the
Department to report no later than 90 days
after the enactment of this Act on the imple-
mentation of GAO’s recommendation in its
April 2019 report, ‘‘Federal Student Aid: Ac-
tions Needed to Evaluate Pell Grant Pilot for In-
carcerated Students’’ (GAO–19–130).
DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT
Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) Compli-
ance with ESEA.—The Department shall pro-
vide a report to the committees of jurisdic-
tion within 180 days of enactment of this Act
on how it evaluates the BIE’s compliance
with ESEA.
Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC).—The
agreement is concerned with the proposed
elimination of key data elements from the
2019–20 CRDC that could impede efforts to
identify and address inequities in edu-
cational resources and outcomes. Further,
the agreement is concerned that the Depart-
ment did not first review or evaluate the
2017–18 CRDC collection before proposing the
elimination of these elements. As the CRDC
is used to monitor and enforce equal oppor-
tunity in education, the agreement is con-
cerned that the Department’s rationale for
elimination focused on reducing regulatory
burden while not including a comprehensive
analysis of whether eliminating certain data
elements would negatively impact the abil-
ity to understand or address civil rights
issues in our nation’s schools. The agree-
ment directs the Department to provide a
briefing to the appropriations and author-
izing Committees within 90 days of enact-
ment of this Act on the proposed changes,
how the changes reflect civil rights enforce-
ment needs, information on the comments
received on the proposal, an evaluation of
the 2017–18 CRDC, and any impact on the
mission and purpose of the CRDC and the Of-
fice for Civil Rights.
Competitions.—The agreement notes long-
standing concern regarding the Depart-
ment’s failure to issue notices inviting appli-
cations for competitive grant competitions
in a timely manner. Such delays often result
in a significant number of programs award-
ing grants in the final weeks of the fiscal
year. Moreover, these delays have occurred
for enduring, authorized programs for which
there is sufficient funding history to believe
appropriations will continue. The Depart-
ment is directed to brief the Committees no
later than 60 days after enactment of this
Act on steps it has taken or will take to
issue notices earlier in fiscal year 2020 and
subsequent years.
Computer Science Education.—The agree-
ment supports the Department’s
prioritization of computer science education
in fiscal year 2019 grant competitions and
supports this focus in fiscal year 2020.
Department of Interior Schools.—The Depart-
ments of Education and Interior are com-
mended for their efforts to improve the lives
of American Indian students through a qual-
ity education. However, more should be done
to improve the long-documented issues fac-
ing Department of Interior schools. The De-
partments of Education and Interior are en-
couraged to continue to work together to
improve the quality of education opportuni-
ties offered to Indian youth.
Disaster Recovery.—Funding awarded under
the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115–
123) is available for obligation through fiscal
year 2022, in part to address potentially
lengthy recovery efforts. As grantees have
experienced both expected and unexpected
challenges that have slowed the expenditure
of funds, the agreement strongly encourages
the Department to extend the time grantees
awarded funds in 2018 currently have to ex-
pend funds, as applicable, consistent with
the terms of section 21208(b) of such Act.
Disclosures of Foreign Gifts and Contracts.—
The agreement notes that section 117 of the
HEA requires IHEs to disclose certain gifts
from or contracts with foreign entities and
that the Department makes such informa-
tion publicly available on its website. Such
disclosures are critical to ensure adequate
oversight and transparency. The agreement
directs the Department to engage with IHEs
to ensure requirements under section 117 are
clear and to provide guidance to IHEs to en-
sure they are aware of their responsibilities.
As the Department provides guidance on this
issue or modifies reporting methods or re-
quirements, IHEs should be given adequate
time to ensure proper reporting. The Depart-
ment should brief the Committees within 45
days of enactment of this Act on efforts to
engage with the stakeholder community, ef-
forts to provide greater guidance and clarity
on reporting requirements, and any addi-
tional information on agency efforts to com-
ply with such section.
Diverse Geographical Distribution of
Grants.—The Department is encouraged to
continue efforts to ensure that competitive
grants are distributed among eligible enti-
ties that serve geographically diverse areas,
including urban, suburban, and rural areas.
It is critical that support and solutions de-
veloped with Federal funding are relevant to
and available in all areas consistent with au-
thorizations of Federal programs.
Evidence-Based Grant Making.—The Sec-
retary should use demonstrated evidence of
effectiveness as part of the selection criteria
through its Education Department General
Administrative Regulations, consistent with
authorizations, for all competitive grant pro-
grams. Non-competitive formula grant funds
have a range of evidence requirements and
preferences which the Department is di-
rected to support through enhancements to
its technical assistance and support activi-
ties.
Foundations for Evidence-Based Policy-
making.—Faithful execution of the Founda-
tions for Evidence-based Policymaking Act
will enhance the evidence-building capacity
of Federal agencies, strengthen privacy pro-
tections, improve secure access to data, and
ultimately provide more and higher quality
evidence to policymakers. The Department
shall provide updates on its implementation
of the law and plans for the coming year in
its next and subsequent Congressional Jus-
tifications.
GAO Report on Teacher Shortages.—The
agreement requests GAO provide a report to
the Committees on trends and factors con-
tributing to school districts’ challenges with
teacher recruitment and retention. The re-
port should include a review and analysis of
challenges recruiting and retaining special
education teachers, paraprofessionals, and
teacher aides; the extent to which licensure
requirements are waived or modified to ad-
dress shortages; and geographic and demo-
graphic characteristics of districts facing
the greatest challenges or shortages, includ-
ing rural and urban areas. The report shall
examine ways to improve the effectiveness of
current Federal policy in preventing and re-
sponding to teacher shortages as well as
make recommendations on potential Federal
interventions to improve teacher recruit-
ment and retention.
Human Resources.—The agreement is con-
cerned about the full-time equivalent em-
ployment differences between the Depart-
ment’s Congressional Justifications and ac-
tual on-board staffing reports. The agree-
ment notes an increase in the number of sep-
arations and hiring challenges at the Depart-
ment. The agreement requests an update in
the fiscal year 2021 Congressional Justifica-
tion on the activities the Department has
undertaken or will undertake to ensure ade-
quate staffing levels are achieved for the De-
partment to meet its obligations. The Com-
mittees request periodic updates on this ef-
fort.
Seclusion and Restraint Data.—The agree-
ment strongly urges the Assistant Secretary
for the Office for Civil Rights to take imme-
diate steps in the ongoing 2017–2018 CRDC to
improve the accuracy of the data, to remind
and clarify for all schools and school dis-
tricts to only report zero incidents of seclu-
sion and restraint when no incidents have
occurred, to leave cells blank for missing or
incomplete data, and to contact schools and
school districts that already submitted data
for the 2017–2018 CRDC and verify the accu-
racy of the data. Finally, the agreement
strongly urges the Assistant Secretary to
monitor compliance with action plan re-
quirements for missing data, and ensure
plans are submitted and address all missing
data. The agreement requests an update on
these efforts in the fiscal year 2021 Congres-
sional Justification.

$1,350,000 for the one-time costs associated
with a move of the headquarters office.
CORPORATION FOR NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY
SERVICE (CNCS)
OPERATING EXPENSES
Innovation, Assistance, and Other Activi-
ties.—The agreement includes $9,600,000 for
innovation, assistance, and other activities.
The agreement includes $6,400,000 for the
Volunteer Generation Fund, $2,100,000 for the
September 11th National Day of Service and
Remembrance and $1,100,000 for the Martin
Luther King, Jr. National Day of Service.
Commission Investment Fund.—The agree-
ment includes no less than $8,500,000.
Fixed Amount Grants.—CNCS is encouraged
to expand opportunities for AmeriCorps pro-
grams to utilize fixed amount grants, which
could reduce unnecessary administrative
burdens on current and potential
AmeriCorps programs. Further, CNCS is en-
couraged to increase the current maximum
cost per member service year of fixed
amount grants to make it more comparable
to cost reimbursement grant levels and allow
new AmeriCorps programs to be eligible to
apply for full-time fixed amount grants,
while also ensuring that fixed amount grant-
ees provide a comparable amount of match-
ing funds and that there is sufficient over-
sight and accountability of fixed amount
grantees.
Professional Corps.—CNCS is directed to in-
clude a determination of need by the local
community among the factors that a profes-
sional corps program may use to dem-
onstrate an inadequate number of profes-
sionals in a community. Further, CNCS is
strongly encouraged to increase the max-
imum amount of operating funds per member
service year a professional corps program
may request as part of their grant applica-
tion. Finally, CNCS is directed to provide
professional corps programs flexibility in
justifying the need for operating funds to en-
sure that these programs are able to provide
high-quality services in all communities.
Transformation and Sustainability Plan.—
There is concern with CNCS’ transformation
and sustainability plan (TSP), particularly
related to moving from a State office to re-
gional office structure. CNCS is directed to
ensure that TSP does not create degradation
in services, technical assistance, or support
for local community service programs, par-
ticularly those operating in under-served and
rural areas, and to provide periodic briefings
to the Committees on steps taken to ensure
that service is maintained. Further, the
CNCS is directed to provide a report within
30 days of enactment of this Act to the Com-
mittees. Such report should contain informa-
tion on the metrics used and factors consid-
ered in determining the new regions and the
location of regional offices; a complete anal-
ysis of all costs and savings associated with
the transition to regional offices, including
any increased travel or training costs; a de-
scription of other field structures considered;
and a detailed response to each of the risk
factors identified by the OIG. Finally, CNCS
is encouraged to evaluate and consider add-
ing additional regional offices as appropriate
if it is determined that offices would en-
hance support for local community service
programs.
CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING
(CPB)
The bill removes unnecessary language re-
lated to the Television Future Fund as no
such fund exists. All operation of the Tele-
vision Future Fund ceased after a 2004 GAO
report titled ‘‘Issues Related to Federal Fund-
ing for Public Television by the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting’’ (GAO-04-284) determined
activities were done in an unauthorized man-
ner. The agreement expects CPB to fully
comply with all statutory requirements for
the allocation and distribution of appro-
priated funds.

seum and Library Services, the agreement
includes funds for the following activities:

MEDICAID AND CHIP PAYMENT AND ACCESS
COMMISSION (MACPAC)
Non-Emergency Medical Transportation
(NEMT).—Within the amount provided, the
agreement provides $300,000 for MACPAC to
examine, to the extent data are available,
the benefits of NEMT from State Medicaid
programs on Medicaid beneficiaries, includ-
ing beneficiaries with chronic diseases in-
cluding end stage renal disease (ESRD), sub-
stance abuse disorders, pregnant mothers,
and patients living in remote, rural areas,
and to examine the benefits of improving
local coordination of NEMT with public
transportation and other Federally-assisted
transportation services. The agreement di-
rects HHS to take no regulatory action on
availability of NEMT service until the study
is completed.
NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD (NLRB)
The agreement notes concern regarding
NLRB personnel and obligation practices.
Such practices have contributed to signifi-
cant underspending on personnel costs. As a
result of these practices, NLRB has had
higher than historical funding lapses for the
past two fiscal years. The October 2019 In-
spector General ‘‘Top Management and Per-
formance Challenges’’ memorandum included
in NLRB fiscal year 2019 Performance and
Accountability Report identifies NLRB’s
current methodology for determining the
workforce capacity needed to process cases
as a key challenge to the Board’s ability to
ensure the quality of its investigative work
product and maintain a highly motivated
workforce.
The agreement directs NLRB to address
this challenge by posting position openings
to restore critical field staff capacity and to
more aggressively fill vacancies in fiscal
year 2020, including the remaining open re-
gional director positions. To ensure NLRB
makes progress toward addressing this issue,
the agreement directs the Board to expand
the number of regional full-time equivalent
staff beyond the amount on-board at the end
of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.
Within 90 days of enactment of this Act,
NLRB is directed to brief the Committees on
its plans for addressing these critical hiring
challenges.
Further, NLRB is directed to submit a re-
port to the Committees within 90 days of en-
actment of this Act detailing the resources
dedicated to regional offices. Such report
should include actual and planned data, as
applicable, for fiscal years 2011 through 2021:
(1) the number of employees stationed in
each regional office and (2) administrative
expenses by object class for each regional of-
fice. In addition, the agreement directs the
Board to provide monthly staffing reports to
the Committees. Such staffing reports
should include the total number of employ-
ees in each position for each regional office,
attrition for each office, new hires for each
office, and any information on plans to
incentivize or encourage employee separa-
tions.
RAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD
LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATION
The agreement includes $10,000,000 for the
implementation of information technology
systems modernization efforts.
GAO Review.—The agreement requests
GAO conduct a management review of the
Railroad Retirement Board, including, finan-
cial management practices, regional office
structure and workforce planning needs,
oversight of programs, and any other mat-
ters GAO considers relevant.
SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION (SSA)
LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
The agreement includes an increase of
$100,000,000 for SSA’s base administrative ex-
penses for additional hires and resources to
improve public service at SSA field offices
and direct service operations.
Continuing Disability Reviews.—The agree-
ment directs SSA to include in its next con-
tinuing disability review (CDR) report to
Congress an evaluation of its CDR
prioritization models and a cost-benefit
analysis of how it uses estimated savings in
determining which beneficiaries receive a
full-medical CDR. Additionally, the agree-
ment requests in the fiscal year 2021 Con-
gressional Justification, the process by
which SSA intends to pace its CDR workload
to properly manage Limitation on Adminis-
trative Expenses funding.
Disability Case Processing System (DCPS).—
SSA is encouraged to engage with States to
explore all possible options for moderniza-
tion of the case processing system, to align
with the needs of each State, so long as such
options have similar or better functionality
as DCPS, similar or lower costs to DCPS,
and are consistent with Federal procurement
and security standards. SSA should continue
to provide regular updates on the effort to
upgrade DCPS, including the cost and antici-
pated timeline of the project, and efforts by
SSA to engage stakeholders, including any
barriers to implementation.
Disability Hearings Backlog.—The agree-
ment encourages SSA to include comprehen-
sive information in its existing reports to
Congress on the specific policies SSA has im-
plemented, or has considered, to streamline
the disability determination and adjudica-
tion process. When considering or imple-
menting changes, SSA should ensure due
process, and that applicants have a full and
adequate opportunity to present their
claims.
Field Office Closures.—While SSA’s Inspec-
tor General reviews decisions to close field
offices, the Commissioner is strongly encour-
aged to take every action possible to main-
tain operations at the offices under review.

SSA is expected to support front line oper-
ations. As part of the fiscal year 2021 Con-
gressional Justification, SSA should include
a plan to identify opportunities for improved
field office operations. Finally, SSA is
strongly encouraged to ensure its policies
and procedures for closing field offices in-
clude at least 120 days advance notice to the
public, SSA employees, Congress, and other
stakeholders. Such notice should include a
rationale for the proposed closure and an
evaluation of the effects on the public and
SSA operations.
Mail and Printing Systems.—SSA is encour-
aged to consider and evaluate modernization
of its mail and printing systems and con-
tracts that could result in budgetary savings
while improving fraud prevention. The
agreement requests a briefing for the Com-
mittees within 180 days of enactment of this
Act on current mailing and printing systems
and contracts, including systems or con-
tracts relating to Social Security Cards, and
any ongoing efforts to modernize or other-
wise improve such systems.
Medical Vocational Guidelines.—The agree-
ment directs SSA to provide a report to the
Committees within 90 days of enactment of
this Act on its plan and timetable for updat-
ing and modernizing medical vocational
guidelines and to engage appropriate Com-
mittees of jurisdiction prior to making any
changes to such guidelines.
Telework.—SSA is urged to develop a
telework plan for Operations employees as
quickly as practicable and to brief the Com-
mittees on the status of efforts to reinstate
telework within 60 days of enactment of this
Act.
Video Hearings.—The agreement reiterates
the language included under this heading in
House Report 116-62, and directs SSA to pro-
vide an update in the fiscal year 2021 Con-
gressional Justification detailing the extent
to which SSA meets best practices outlined
by the Administrative Conference of the
U.S., and the extent to which SSA video
hearings, policies, and practices are acces-
sible to individuals with disabilities.
Work Incentives Planning and Assistance
(WIPA) and Protection and Advocacy for Bene-
ficiaries of Social Security (PABSS).—The
agreement includes $23,000,000 for WIPA and
$7,000,000 for PABSS.

H11162 December 17, 2019
DIVISION B—AGRICULTURE, RURAL DE-
VELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINIS-
TRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES AP-
PROPRIATIONS ACT, 2020
CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTIVES
The statement is silent on provisions that
were in both the House Report (H. Rpt. 116–
107) and Senate Report (S. Rpt. 116–110) that
remain unchanged by this agreement, except
as noted in this statement.
The House and Senate report language
that is not changed by the statement is ap-
proved and indicates congressional inten-
tions. The statement, while repeating some
report language for emphasis, does not in-
tend to negate the language referred to
above unless expressly provided herein.
In cases in which the House or the Senate
have directed the submission of a report,
such report is to be submitted to both the
House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions no later than 60 days after enactment
of this Act, unless otherwise directed.
Hereafter, in division B of this statement,
the term ‘the Committees’ refers to the Com-
mittees on Appropriations of the House of
Representatives and the Senate.
For the appropriations provided by this
Act and previous Acts, the departments and
agencies funded by this agreement are re-
minded that the Committees use the defini-
tions for transfer, reprogramming, and pro-
gram, project, and activity as defined by the
Government Accountability Office (GAO) in
GAO–04–261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I
and GAO–05–734SP Budget Glossary.
A transfer is the shifting of funds between
appropriations. It applies to (1) transfers
from one agency to another, (2) transfers
from one account to another within the same
agency, and (3) transfers to an interagency
or intra-agency working fund. In each in-
stance, statutory authority is required.
Reprogramming is the utilization of funds
in an appropriation account for purposes
other than those contemplated at the time of
appropriation. It is the shifting of funds from
one object to another within an appropria-
tion.
A program, project, or activity (PPA) is an
element within a budget account. PPAs are
identified by reference to include the most
specific level of budget items identified in
the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food
and Drug Administration, and Related Agen-
cies Act, 2020, accompanying Committee re-
ports, explanatory statements, and budget
justifications. Program activity structures
are intended to provide a meaningful rep-
resentation of the operations financed by a
specific budget account by project, activity,
or organization.
For fiscal year 2020, the Committees con-
tinue to include bill language requiring ad-
vanced notification of certain agency ac-
tions. Notification will be required at least
30 days in advance of any action if (1) a
major capital investment is modified; (2) an
office is realigned or reorganized; and (3) ac-
tivities are carried out that were not de-
scribed in the budget request.
The agreement directs the Office of Budget
and Program Analysis (OBPA) of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) to pro-
vide an organizational chart for each agency
funded by this Act to the division and sub-
division level, as appropriate, by February 1,
2020. The agreement also directs the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), the Com-
modity Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC), and the Farm Credit Administration
(FCA) to provide an organizational chart of
each agency respectively to the division and
subdivision level, as appropriate, by Feb-
ruary 1, 2020.
Further, USDA, FDA, and CFTC should be
mindful of Congressional authority to deter-
mine and set final funding levels for fiscal
year 2021. Therefore, the agencies should not
presuppose program funding outcomes and
prematurely initiate action to redirect staff-
ing prior to knowing final outcomes on fiscal
year 2021 program funding. The agreement
directs OBPA to provide the Committees
with the number of staff years and employ-
ees on board for each agency funded by this
Act on a quarterly basis.
TITLE I
AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS
PROCESSING, RESEARCH AND MARKETING
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
The agreement provides $46,139,000 for the
Office of the Secretary.
The agreement is concerned with the num-
ber of staff vacancies within USDA. While
funding levels continue to increase for many
agencies, staffing levels continue to decline.
Within 180 days after enactment, the Sec-
retary shall provide detailed staffing levels
for all research agencies, the Farm Service
Agency, all marketing agencies, Rural De-
velopment, the Food and Nutrition Service,
and the Foreign Agricultural Service. The
report shall include all vacancies that have
remained unfilled for more than six months
and detailed plans to fill those vacancies.
The report shall also include for each agen-
cy, the number of fulltime equivalent (FTE)
staff utilized and the number of vacancies for
fiscal years 2015 through 2019.
The agreement notes the ongoing contract
negotiations between West Coast grain ter-
minal operators and the International
Longshore and Warehouse Union and recog-
nizes the importance of reaching an agree-
ment that works for both parties. A failure
to reach an agreement could result in an
interruption in grain terminal service that
would negatively impact the nation’s grain
exports. The agreement urges all parties to
continue negotiating in good faith to ensure
an equitable outcome for both grain ter-
minal operators and their workers is expedi-
tiously reached.
The agreement directs the Secretary to
submit a report that describes the economic
and environmental impacts of importing or-
chids in growing media. The report shall in-
clude: a description of the economic impact
of importing orchids in growing media on a
state-by-state basis, with data collected
from local growers; any incidents of pests de-
tected on orchids imported with growing
media; and an analysis with respect to addi-
tional resources that are necessary to pre-
vent and mitigate the introduction of pests
resulting from importing orchids in growing
media.
The agreement directs the Secretary to
preserve the term ‘‘climate change’’ in any
publication where scientifically appropriate.
In addition to updates provided to the
Committees, the Department is directed to
include in its fiscal year 2021 Congressional
Justification, as a single exhibit, a table list-
ing all deliverables, with a column for due
dates if applicable.
The Department is reminded of enacted
language prohibiting the initiating, plan-
ning, developing, implementing, or making
of any changes to remove or relocate any
systems, missions, or functions of the offices
of the Chief Financial Officer or any per-
sonnel from the National Finance Center
prior to written notification to and prior ap-
proval of the Committee on Appropriations
of both Houses of Congress.
The agreement recognizes the important
role of the Forest Service Job Corps Civilian
Conservation Centers and directs the Sec-
retary to continue the program as currently
structured.
The Department is directed to treat crop
losses due to freeze as losses resulting from
snowstorms and therefore eligible for WHIP+
payments.

H11198 December 17, 2019
DIVISION C—ENERGY AND WATER DEVEL-
OPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES AP-
PROPRIATIONS ACT, 2020
The following statement to the House of
Representatives and the Senate is submitted
in explanation of the agreed upon Act mak-
ing appropriations for energy and water de-
velopment for the fiscal year ending Sep-
tember 30, 2020, and for other purposes.
This explanatory statement, while repeat-
ing some report language for emphasis, does
not intend to negate the language and allo-
cations set forth in House Report 116–83
(‘‘House report’’) and Senate Report 116–102
(‘‘Senate report’’) and that direction shall be
complied with unless specifically addressed
to the contrary in the accompanying bill or
explanatory statement. Additionally, where
this explanatory statement states that the
‘‘agreement only includes’’ or ‘‘the following
is the only’’ direction, any direction included
in the House or Senate report on that matter
shall be considered as replaced with the di-
rection provided within this explanatory
statement. In cases where the House or the
Senate has directed the submission of a re-
port, such report is to be submitted to the
Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress. House or Senate report-
ing requirements with deadlines prior to or
within 15 days of the enactment of this Act
shall be submitted not later than 60 days
after enactment of this Act. All other report-
ing deadlines not changed by this explana-
tory statement are to be met.
Funds for the individual programs and ac-
tivities within the accounts in this Act are
displayed in the detailed table at the end of
the explanatory statement for this Act.
Funding levels that are not displayed in the
detailed table are identified in this explana-
tory statement.
In fiscal year 2020, for purposes of the Bal-
anced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control
Act of 1985 (Public Law 99–177), the following
information provides the definition of the
term ‘‘program, project, or activity’’ for de-
partments and agencies under the jurisdic-
tion of the Energy and Water Development
Appropriations Act. The term ‘‘program,
project, or activity’’ shall include the most
specific level of budget items identified in
the Energy and Water Development Appro-
priations Act, 2020 and the explanatory
statement accompanying this Act.
No specific funds for rejecting any applica-
tion for a grant available under funds appro-
priated by this Act because of the use of the
term ‘‘global warming’’ or the term ‘‘climate
change’’ in the application are included for
any agency funded in this Act.
TITLE I—CORPS OF ENGINEERS—CIVIL
DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY
CORPS OF ENGINEERS—CIVIL
The summary tables included in this title
set forth the dispositions with respect to the
individual appropriations, projects, and ac-
tivities of the Corps of Engineers (Corps).
Additional items of this Act are discussed
below.
Asian Carp.—The agreement acknowledges
that the Corps completed the Report of the
Chief of Engineers for the Great Lakes—Mis-
sissippi River Interbasin Study—Brandon
Road Recommended Plan in fiscal year 2019.
As the Corps prioritizes projects, it shall
consider critical projects to prevent the
spread of invasive species. The Corps is re-
minded that this critical project is eligible
to compete for additional funding within the
Investigations account in order to initiate
Planning, Engineering, and Design (PED).
The Corps is directed to provide to the Com-
mittees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress quarterly updates on the progress
and status of efforts to prevent the further
spread of Asian carp, including the Brandon
Road Recommended Plan, the location and
density of carp populations, the use of emer-
gency procedures previously authorized by
Congress, and the development, consider-
ation, and implementation of new techno-
logical and structural countermeasures.
There is disappointment that the adminis-
tration chose to cut Corps funding for the
important inter-agency collaborative work
to address Asian carp. The Corps shall con-
tinue to collaborate at levels commensurate
with previous years with the U.S. Coast
Guard, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
the State of Illinois, and members of the
Asian Carp Regional Coordinating Com-
mittee, including identifying navigation pro-
tocols that would be beneficial or effective in
reducing the risk of vessels inadvertently
carrying aquatic invasive species, including
Asian carp, through the Brandon Road Lock
and Dam in Joliet, Illinois. Any findings of
such an evaluation shall be included in the
quarterly briefings to the Committees on Ap-
propriations of both Houses of Congress. The
Corps is further directed to implement navi-
gation protocols shown to be effective at re-
ducing the risk of entrainment without jeop-
ardizing the safety of vessels and crews. The
Corps and other federal and state agencies
are conducting ongoing research on potential
solutions. The Corps shall brief the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress on such navigation protocols and
potential solutions not later than 30 days
after enactment of this Act.
Budget Structure Changes.—The agreement
includes House and Senate language regard-
ing budget structure changes.
Inland Waterways System.—The agreement
includes House and Senate language.
Regional Dredge Demonstration Program.—To
respond more effectively to critical national
dredging requirements resulting from sig-
nificant recurring storm events, in combina-
tion with routine annual dredging demands,
the agreement directs the Corps to execute a
multi-year dredging demonstration program
within the Central Gulf Coast Region.
Key features of the program will explore
innovative ways of executing dredging in a
logical, sequenced manner, unconstrained by
more traditional project-specific, account-
specific, or single-year practices and seek ef-
ficiencies and cost savings by evaluating the
region as a system to determine when com-
bining work across multiple deep draft com-
mercial navigation projects, across years, or
across Construction and Operation and Main-
tenance accounts is appropriate. By includ-
ing the Mississippi River Baton Rouge to the
Gulf of Mexico (Southwest Pass) and other
nearby Gulf Coast commercial navigation
projects, the goals of the program are to in-
clude being more responsive to dredging de-
mands within the region, while minimizing
disruption to critical construction and main-
tenance dredging requirements enterprise-
wide.
To demonstrate the described multi-year
efficiencies, the agreement includes
$377,650,000 in a Regional Dredge Demonstra-
tion Program funding line item in the Con-
struction account to be used for deep draft
navigation projects in the Gulf of Mexico be-
tween Louisiana and Alabama within the
Mississippi Valley Division and the South
Atlantic Division Civil Works boundaries.
The Corps shall select one deepening project
in each eligible state for inclusion in the
demonstration program. Projects that have
previously received funding from the Con-
struction account and require no new au-
thorization shall be eligible for inclusion in
the demonstration program. Consequently,
such projects shall be considered ongoing
and shall not require a new start designa-
tion. The agreement includes additional
funding in the Operation and Maintenance
account to support this demonstration pro-
gram. Operation and Maintenance projects
eligible for inclusion in the demonstration
program may include Gulf of Mexico states
between Florida and Texas, where appro-
priate. The agreement also includes Senate
briefing and reporting requirements.
ADDITIONAL FUNDING
The agreement includes funding above the
budget request to ensure continued improve-
ments to our national economy, public safe-
ty, and environmental health that result
from water resources projects. This funding
is for additional work that either was not in-
cluded in the budget request or was inad-
equately budgeted. The bill contains a provi-
sion requiring the Corps to allocate funds in
accordance with only the direction in this
agreement. In lieu of all House and Senate
direction—under any heading—regarding ad-
ditional funding, new starts, and the fiscal
year 2020 work plan, the Corps shall follow
the direction included in this explanatory
statement.
The executive branch retains complete dis-
cretion over project-specific allocation deci-
sions within the additional funds provided,
subject to only the direction here and under
the heading ‘‘Additional Funding’’ or ‘‘Addi-
tional Funding for Ongoing Work’’ within
each of the Investigations, Construction,
Mississippi River and Tributaries, and Oper-
ation and Maintenance accounts. A study or
project may not be excluded from evaluation
for being ‘‘inconsistent with administration
policy.’’ Voluntary funding in excess of le-
gally-required cost shares for studies and
projects is acceptable, but shall not be used
as a criterion for allocating the additional
funding provided or for the selection of new
starts.
The administration is reminded that these
funds are in addition to the budget request,
and administration budget metrics shall not
be a reason to disqualify a study or project
from being funded. It is expected that all of
the additional funding provided will be allo-
cated to specific programs, projects, or ac-
tivities. The focus of the allocation process
shall favor the obligation, rather than ex-
penditure, of funds.
The Corps shall evaluate all studies and
projects only within accounts and categories
consistent with previous congressional fund-
ing. When allocating the additional funding
provided in this Act, the Corps shall consider
eligibility and implementation decisions
under Public Law 115–123 and Public Law 116–
20 so as to maximize the reduction of risk to
public safety and infrastructure and the re-
duction of future damages from floods and
storms nationwide.
A project or study shall be eligible for ad-
ditional funding within the Investigations,
Construction, and Mississippi River and
Tributaries accounts if: (1) it has received
funding, other than through a reprogram-
ming, in at least one of the previous three
fiscal years; (2) it was previously funded and
could reach a significant milestone, com-
plete a discrete element of work, or produce
significant outputs in calendar year 2020; or
(3) as appropriate, it is selected as one of the
new starts allowed in accordance with this
Act and the additional direction provided
below. None of the additional funding in any
account may be used for any item where
funding was specifically denied or for
projects in the Continuing Authorities Pro-
gram. Funds shall be allocated consistent
with statutory cost share requirements.
Work Plan.—Not later than 60 days after
enactment of this Act, the Corps shall pro-
vide to the Committees on Appropriations of
both Houses of Congress a work plan includ-
ing the following information: (1) a detailed

description of the process and criteria used
to evaluate studies and projects; (2) delinea-
tion of how these funds are to be allocated;
(3) a summary of the work to be accom-
plished with each allocation, including phase
of work and the study or project’s remaining
cost to complete (excluding Operation and
Maintenance); and (4) a list of all studies and
projects that were considered eligible for
funding but did not receive funding, includ-
ing an explanation of whether the study or
project could have used funds in calendar
year 2020 and the specific reasons each study
or project was considered as being less com-
petitive for an allocation of funds.
New Starts.—The agreement includes six
new starts in the Investigations account and
six new starts in the Construction account to
be distributed across the authorized mission
areas of the Corps.
Of the new starts in Investigations, one
shall be for an environmental restoration
study; one shall be for a multi-purpose wa-
tershed study to address coastal resiliency;
one shall be for a flood and storm damage re-
duction study; one shall be for a flood and
storm damage reduction study or environ-
mental restoration study; and two shall be
for navigation studies. Of the two navigation
study starts, one may be for a Small, Re-
mote or Subsistence Harbor navigation
study. Of the new construction starts, two
shall be for navigation projects; two shall be
for environmental restoration projects, of
which one shall be for the new project start
requested by the administration pursuant to
the Fiscal Year 2020 Budget amendments
transmitted to Congress on May 13, 2019; and
two shall be for flood and storm damage re-
duction, environmental restoration, or
multi-purpose projects. No funding shall be
used to initiate new programs, projects, or
activities in the Mississippi River and Tribu-
taries or Operation and Maintenance ac-
counts.
The Corps is directed to propose a single
group of new starts as a part of the work
plan. None of the funds may be used for any
item for which the agreement has specifi-
cally denied funding. The Corps may not
change or substitute the new starts selected
once the work plan has been provided to the
Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress. Each new start shall be
funded from the appropriate additional fund-
ing line item. Any project for which the new
start requirements are not met by the end of
calendar year 2020 shall be treated as if the
project had not been selected as a new start;
such a project shall be required to compete
again for new start funding in future years.
As all new starts are to be chosen by the
Corps, all shall be considered of equal impor-
tance, and the expectation is that future
budget submissions will include appropriate
funding for all new starts selected.
There continues to be confusion regarding
the executive branch’s policies and guide-
lines regarding which studies and projects
require new start designations. Therefore,
the Corps is directed to notify the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress at least seven days prior to execu-
tion of an agreement for construction of any
project except environmental infrastructure
projects and projects under the Continuing
Authorities Program. Additionally, the
agreement reiterates and clarifies previous
congressional direction as follows. Neither
study nor construction activities related to
individual projects authorized under section
1037 of the Water Resources Reform and De-
velopment Act (WRRDA) of 2014 shall require
a new start or new investment decision;
these activities shall be considered ongoing
work. No new start or new investment deci-
sion shall be required when moving from fea-
sibility to PED. A new start designation
shall be required to initiate construction of
individually-authorized projects funded
within programmatic line items. No new
start or new investment decision shall be re-
quired to initiate work on a separable ele-
ment of a project when construction of one
or more separable elements of that project
was initiated previously; it shall be consid-
ered ongoing work. A new construction start
shall not be required for work undertaken to
correct a design deficiency on an existing
federal project; it shall be considered ongo-
ing work. The Corps is reminded that re-
sumptions are just that—resumption of pre-
viously-initiated studies or projects and, as
such, do not require new start designations.
In addition to the priority factors used to
allocate all additional funding provided in
the Investigations account, the Corps should
give careful consideration to the out-year
budget impacts of the studies selected and to
whether there appears to be an identifiable
local sponsor that will be ready and able to
provide, in a timely manner, the necessary
cost share for the feasibility and PED
phases. The Corps is reminded that the flood
and storm damage reduction mission area
can include instances where non-federal
sponsors are seeking assistance with flood
control and unauthorized discharges from
permitted wastewater treatment facilities
and that the navigation mission area in-
cludes work in remote and subsistence har-
bor areas. Within the flood and storm dam-
age reduction mission, the Corps is urged to
strive for an appropriate balance between in-
land and coastal projects.
In addition to the priority factors used to
allocate all additional funding provided in
the Construction account, the Corps also
shall consider the out-year budget impacts of
the selected new starts, the cost sharing
sponsor’s ability and willingness to promptly
provide the cash contribution, if any, as well
as required lands, easements, rights-of-way,
relocations, and disposal areas. When consid-
ering new construction starts, only those
that can execute a project cost sharing
agreement not later than December 31, 2020,
shall be chosen.
To ensure that the new construction starts
are affordable and will not unduly delay
completion of any ongoing projects, the Sec-
retary is required to submit to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress a realistic out-year budget scenario
prior to issuing a work allowance for a new
start. It is understood that specific budget
decisions are made on an annual basis and
that this scenario is neither a request for nor
a guarantee of future funding for any
project. Nonetheless, this scenario shall in-
clude an estimate of annual funding for each
new start utilizing a realistic funding sce-
nario through completion of the project, as
well as the specific impacts of that esti-
mated funding on the ability of the Corps to
make continued progress on each previously
funded construction project, including im-
pacts to the optimum timeline and funding
requirements of the ongoing projects, and on
the ability to consider initiating new
projects in the future. The scenario shall as-
sume a Construction account funding level
at the average of the past three budget re-
quests.
INVESTIGATIONS
The agreement includes $151,000,000 for In-
vestigations. The agreement includes legisla-
tive language regarding parameters for new
study starts.
The allocation for projects and activities
within the Investigations account is shown
in the following table:

Additional Funding.—The Corps is expected
to allocate the additional funding provided
in this account primarily to specific feasi-
bility and PED phases, rather than to Re-
maining Items line items as has been the
case in previous work plans.
Of the additional funding provided in this
account for environmental restoration or
compliance, the Corps shall allocate not less
than $9,782,000 for ecosystem restoration
projects in the PED phase that have been
funded within the last three years.
Of the additional funding provided in this
account for environmental restoration or
compliance and other authorized project pur-
poses, the Corps shall allocate not less than
$2,000,000 for ecosystem restoration projects
that are modifications to flood protection
project authorizations to address degraded
conditions due to prior flood protection
work. Of the additional funding provided in
this account for environmental restoration
or compliance and other authorized project
purposes, the Corps shall allocate not less
than $200,000 to PED activities for ecosystem
restoration projects that also provide addi-
tional flood storage capacity by restoring
the natural habitat.
Of the additional funding provided in this
account for flood and storm damage reduc-
tion and flood control, the Corps shall allo-
cate not less than $1,500,000 for PED for
projects that are located in economically-
disadvantaged communities where per capita
income is less than half of the state and na-
tional averages and that have previously ex-
perienced loss of life due to flooding.
Of the additional funding provided in this
account for shore protection, the Corps shall
allocate not less than $905,000 for the PED
phase of beach renourishment projects that
have been authorized by Congress for con-
struction.
Of the additional funding provided in this
account, the Corps shall allocate not less
than $10,380,000 for multipurpose projects in
the PED phase that have been funded within
the last three years.
When allocating the additional funding
provided in this account, the Corps shall con-
sider giving priority to completing or accel-
erating ongoing studies or to initiating new
studies that will enhance the nation’s eco-
nomic development, job growth, and inter-
national competitiveness; are for projects lo-
cated in areas that have suffered recent nat-
ural disasters; are for projects that protect
life and property; are for projects to restore
floodplain and aquatic habitat through cost-
effective and tested means; or are for
projects to address legal requirements. The
Corps shall use these funds for additional
work in both the feasibility and PED phases.
The agreement includes sufficient additional
funding to undertake a significant amount of
feasibility and PED work. The administra-
tion is reminded that a project study is not
complete until the PED phase is complete.
The Corps is reminded that the updating of
economic analyses and economic impact
studies are eligible to receive additional
funding.
Principles, Requirements, and Guidelines.—
Not later than 60 days after enactment of
this Act, the Corps shall brief the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress on the efforts necessary to develop
implementation rules and guidelines for the
final Principles, Requirements, and Guide-
lines for Federal Investments in Water Re-
sources released in March 2013 and the final
Interagency Guidelines released in December
2014. The Corps shall include in this briefing
a timeline for completion of the implementa-
tion rules and guidelines, how the Corps’ on-
going planning efforts would be impacted by
implementation, impacts to funding
prioritization, and any challenges associated
with the development and implementation of
such rules and guidelines. The Corps is urged
to prioritize these efforts.
CONSTRUCTION
The agreement includes $2,681,000,000 for
Construction. The agreement includes legis-
lative language regarding Chickamauga
Lock, Tennessee River, Tennessee. The
agreement includes legislative language re-
garding parameters for new construction
starts.
The allocation for projects and activities
within the Construction account is shown in
the following table:

Updated Capability.—The agreement ad-
justs some project-specific allocations down-
ward from the budget request based on up-
dated information regarding the amount of
work that could be accomplished in fiscal
year 2020.
Additional Funding.—The agreement in-
cludes additional funds for projects and ac-
tivities to enhance the nation’s economic
growth and international competitiveness.
Of the additional funding provided in this
account for flood control, the Corps shall al-
locate not less than $20,000,000 to undertake
studies and recommendations for construc-
tion resulting from a Dam Safety Modifica-
tion Report completed under section 1177 of
the WIIN Act (Public Law 114–322), as amend-
ed. Of the additional funding provided in this
account for flood and storm damage reduc-
tion and flood control, the Corps shall allo-
cate not less than $20,000,000 to additional
nonstructural flood control projects. Of the
additional funding provided in this account
for flood and storm damage reduction and
flood control, the Corps shall allocate not
less than $25,000,000 to continue construction
of projects that principally address drainage
in urban areas.
Of the additional funding provided in this
account for navigation and other authorized
project purposes, the Corps shall allocate not
less than $50,000,000 to continue activities to
construct new navigation infrastructure for
locks and Corps-owned bridges not on the in-
land waterways system.
Of the additional funding provided in this
account for environmental restoration or
compliance and other authorized project pur-
poses, the Corps shall allocate not less than
$25,000,000 for multistate ecosystem restora-
tion programs for which a comprehensive
restoration plan is in development or has
been completed, of which not less than
$5,000,000 shall be for projects or programs
that restore and rehabilitate native oyster
reefs.
Of the additional funding provided in this
account for environmental restoration or
compliance and other authorized project pur-
poses, the Corps shall allocate not less than
$28,000,000 for ecosystem restoration projects
that have incidental flood risk management
benefits.
Of the additional funds provided in this ac-
count for flood and storm damage reduction,
navigation, and other authorized project pur-
poses, the Corps shall allocate not less than
$35,000,000 to authorized reimbursements for
projects with executed project cooperation
agreements and that have completed con-
struction or where non-federal sponsors in-
tend to use the funds for additional water re-
sources development activities.
Of the additional funds provided in this ac-
count, the Corps shall allocate not less than
$40,588,000 to projects with riverfront devel-
opment components.
Public Law 115–123 and Public Law 116–20
included funding within the Flood Control
and Coastal Emergencies account to restore
authorized shore protection projects to full
project profile. That funding is expected to
address most of the current year capability.
Therefore, to ensure funding is not directed
to where it cannot be used, the agreement
includes $50,165,000 for construction of shore
protection projects. The Corps is reminded
that if additional work can be done, these
projects are also eligible to compete for addi-
tional funding for flood and storm damage
reduction.
When allocating the additional funding
provided in this account, the Corps is en-
couraged to evaluate authorized reimburse-
ments in the same manner as if the projects
were being evaluated for new or ongoing con-
struction. The Corps shall not condition
these funds, or any funds appropriated in
this Act, on a non-federal interest paying
more than their required share in any phase
of a project. When allocating the additional
funding provided in this account, the Corps
shall consider giving priority to the fol-
lowing:
1. benefits of the funded work to the na-
tional economy;
2. extent to which the work will enhance
national, regional, or local economic devel-
opment;
3. number of jobs created directly and sup-
ported in the supply chain by the funded ac-
tivity;
4. significance to national security, includ-
ing the strategic significance of commod-
ities;
5. ability to obligate the funds allocated
within the calendar year, including consider-
ation of the ability of the non-federal spon-
sor to provide any required cost share;
6. ability to complete the project, sepa-
rable element, or project phase with the
funds allocated;
7. legal requirements, including respon-
sibilities to Tribes;
8. for flood and storm damage reduction
projects (including authorized nonstructural
measures and periodic beach renourish-
ments),
a. population, economic activity, or public
infrastructure at risk, as appropriate;
b. the severity of risk of flooding or the
frequency with which an area has experi-
enced flooding; and
c. preservation of historically significant
communities, culture, and heritage;
9. for shore protection projects, projects in
areas that have suffered severe beach erosion
requiring additional sand placement outside
of the normal beach renourishment cycle or
in which the normal beach renourishment
cycle has been delayed, and projects in areas
where there is risk of environmental con-
tamination;
10. for navigation projects, the number of
jobs or level of economic activity to be sup-
ported by completion of the project, sepa-
rable element, or project phase;
11. for projects cost shared with the Inland
Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF), the economic
impact on the local, regional, and national
economy if the project is not funded, as well
as discrete elements of work that can be
completed within the funding provided in
this line item;
12. for other authorized project purposes
and environmental restoration or compli-
ance projects, to include the beneficial use of
dredged material; and
13. for environmental infrastructure,
projects with the greater economic impact,
projects in rural communities, projects in
communities with significant shoreline and
instances of runoff, projects in or that ben-
efit counties or parishes with high poverty
rates, projects in financially-distressed mu-
nicipalities, projects that improve
stormwater capture capabilities, projects
that provide backup raw water supply in the
event of an emergency, and projects that will
provide substantial benefits to water quality
improvements.
The following is the only direction with re-
gard to the availability of additional funds
for IWTF cost-shared projects. The agree-
ment provides funds making use of all esti-
mated annual revenues and some additional
prior year revenues in the IWTF for ongoing
projects. The agreement includes a total ap-
propriation of $131,075,000 from the IWTF.
The Corps shall continue to use, as appro-
priate, the Inland and Intracoastal Water-
ways Twenty-Year Capital Investment Strat-
egy dated March 2016, as the applicable 20-
year plan. The agreement considers the 20-
year Capital Investment Strategy a planning
document and therefore not subject to ad-
ministration budget metrics. The Corps shall
allocate all funds provided in the IWTF Rev-
enues line item along with the statutory
cost share from funds provided in the Navi-
gation line item prior to allocating the re-
mainder of funds in the Navigation line item.
It is understood that the Corps is devel-
oping metrics for prioritization of environ-
mental infrastructure projects. The Corps is
directed to provide to the Committees on Ap-
propriations of both Houses of Congress not
later than 120 days after enactment of this
Act a briefing on these metrics. Notwith-
standing the direction on new starts in the
front matter of Title I, the Corps may allo-
cate funds to at least one, but not more than
two environmental infrastructure authori-
ties not previously funded, which may in-
clude regional environmental infrastructure
authorities. The Corps shall consider the im-
pacts of future funding when selecting these
projects.
Alternative Delivery.—The Corps is re-
minded that Public-Private Partnerships and
projects that utilize a split-delivery ap-
proach are eligible for additional funding in
this account.
Aquatic Plant Control Program.—Of the
funding provided for the Aquatic Plant Con-
trol Program, $1,000,000 shall be for activities
for monitoring, surveys, and control of the
flowering rush. Of the funding provided for
the Aquatic Plant Control Program,
$5,000,000 shall be for nationwide research
and development to address invasive aquatic
plants; within this funding, the Corps is en-
couraged to support cost shared aquatic
plant management programs. Of the funding
provided for the Aquatic Plant Control Pro-
gram, $15,000,000 shall be for watercraft in-
spection stations, as authorized by section
1039 of WRRDA, and $3,000,000 shall be for re-
lated monitoring.
Beneficial Use of Dredged Material Pilot Pro-
gram.—The agreement supports the pilot pro-
gram authorized in section 1122 of the WIIN
Act (Public Law 114–322), but concerns re-
main about implementation of the program.
The agreement provides $7,500,000 for the 10
pilot projects selected to date within ‘‘Bene-
ficial Use of Dredged Material Pilot Pro-
gram.’’ The Corps shall not use Operation
and Maintenance funds provided or allocated
to the projects from which the dredged mate-
rial is generated for costs beyond the costs of
the Federal Standard. The Corps shall brief
the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress not later than 90 days
after enactment of this Act on the planned
activities, costs estimates, and potential
timelines for each of the 10 selected pilot
projects. The Corps is further directed to
brief the Committees on Appropriations of
both Houses of Congress prior to any effort
to solicit or select any additional pilot
projects as authorized by the America’s
Water Infrastructure Act of 2018.
Continuing Authorities Program.—The agree-
ment supports all sections of the Continuing
Authorities Program (CAP). Funding is pro-
vided for nine CAP sections at a total of
$71,500,000, an increase of $68,500,000 above
the budget request, which proposed funding
for only three sections. This program pro-
vides a useful tool for the Corps to undertake
small, localized projects without the lengthy
study and authorization process typical of
larger Corps projects. Within CAP and to the
extent already authorized by law, the Corps
is encouraged to consider projects that en-
hance coastal and ocean ecosystem resil-
iency and projects that restore degraded wet-
land habitat and stream habitat impacted by
construction of Corps levees. The manage-
ment of CAP shall continue consistent with
direction provided in previous fiscal years.
The Corps is encouraged to expedite the
implementation of feasibility studies ap-
proved in 2019 under section 206 of the Flood

Control Act of 1958. The Corps shall allow for
the advancement of flood control projects in
combination with ecological benefits using
natural and nature-based solutions alone or
in combination with built infrastructure
where appropriate for reliable risk reduction
during the development of projects under
section 205 of CAP.
Charleston Harbor.—The agreement in-
cludes House and Senate direction and sup-
ports the budget request to fully fund, up to
the amount in the budget request, the re-
maining construction activities once an
amendment to the existing Project Partner-
ship Agreement is executed. It is understood
that the Corps and the non-federal sponsor
are prepared to sign the agreement upon en-
actment of this Act to ensure expeditious
completion of the deepening project.
Murrieta Creek.—The non-federal sponsor
intends to pursue a section 221 In-Kind Cred-
it Contribution agreement with the Corps to
do the design work to optimize the multi-
purpose basin, find the most cost-effective
design, and initiate excavation of the basin.
The Corps is encouraged to move forward
with timely approval of the agreement. The
non-federal sponsor also is moving forward
to address the outdated information in the
Corps’ economic side-by-side analysis for the
project in order to identify the most cost-ef-
fective project. The Corps is directed to co-
ordinate with the non-federal sponsor, as re-
quested, in the economic update in order to
have a strong basis for proceeding with the
completion of the Limited Reevaluation Re-
port.
South Florida Ecosystem Restoration
(SFER).—As in previous years, the agreement
provides funding for all study and construc-
tion authorities related to Everglades res-
toration under the line item titled South
Florida Ecosystem Restoration, Florida.’’
This single line item allows the Corps flexi-
bility in implementing the numerous activi-
ties underway in any given fiscal year. For
fiscal year 2020, the Corps is directed to
make publicly available a comprehensive
snapshot of all SFER cost share accounting
down to the project level and to ensure the
accuracy of all budget justification sheets
that inform SFER Integrated Financial Plan
documents by October 31, 2020.
MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND TRIBUTARIES
The agreement includes $375,000,000 for
Mississippi River and Tributaries.
The allocation for projects and activities

December 17, 2019
Additional Funding for Ongoing Work.—
When allocating the additional funding pro-
vided in this account, the Corps shall con-
sider giving priority to completing or accel-
erating ongoing work that will enhance the
nation’s economic development, job growth,
and international competitiveness or are for
studies or projects located in areas that have
suffered recent natural disasters. While this
funding is shown under Remaining Items,
the Corps shall use these funds in investiga-
tions, construction, and operation and main-
tenance, as applicable. This may include
work on remaining unconstructed features of
projects permitted and authorized by law, in
response to recent flood disasters.
Of the additional funding provided in this
account, the Corps shall allocate not less
than $30,000,000 for additional flood control
construction projects, of which $15,560,000
shall be for those projects with flood control,
water quality, and sediment reduction bene-
fits.
Of the additional funding provided in this
account for other authorized project pur-
poses, the Corps shall allocate not less than
$1,160,000 for operation and maintenance of
facilities that are educational or to continue
land management of mitigation features.
Mississippi River Commission.—No funding is
provided for this new line item. The Corps is
directed to continue funding the costs of the
commission from within the funds provided
for activities within the Mississippi River
and Tributaries project.
Concerns have been raised that there is a
lack of fisheries expertise when making deci-
sions to open Corps spillways, specifically re-
lated to the economic and ecological con-
sequences experienced by coastal commu-
nities and ecosystems. The Corps is urged to
work with the National Oceanic and Atmos-
pheric Administration to investigate options
for ensuring that the membership and staff
of the Mississippi River Commission include
a fisheries expert.
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE
The agreement includes $3,790,000,000 for
Operation and Maintenance.
The allocation for projects and activities
within the Operation and Maintenance ac-
count is shown in the following table:

December 17, 2019
Updated Capability.—The agreement ad-
justs some project-specific allocations down-
ward from the budget request based on up-
dated information regarding the amount of
work that could be accomplished in fiscal
year 2020.
Additional Funding for Ongoing Work.—Of
the additional funding provided in this ac-
count for other authorized project purposes,
the Corps shall allocate not less than
$2,200,000 to continue greenway trail im-
provements at federal projects.
Of the additional funding provided in this
account for other authorized project pur-
poses, the Corps shall allocate not less than
$2,000,000 for efforts to combat invasive mus-
sels at Corps-owned reservoirs.
When allocating the additional funding
provided in this account, the Corps shall con-
sider giving priority to the following:
1. ability to complete ongoing work main-
taining authorized depths and widths of har-
bors and shipping channels (including small,
remote, or subsistence harbors), including
where contaminated sediments are present;
2. ability to address critical maintenance
backlog;
3. presence of the U.S. Coast Guard;
4. extent to which the work will enhance
national, regional, or local economic devel-
opment, including domestic manufacturing
capacity;
5. extent to which the work will promote
job growth or international competitiveness;
6. number of jobs created directly by the
funded activity;
7. ability to obligate the funds allocated
within the calendar year;
8. ability to complete the project, sepa-
rable element, project phase, or useful incre-
ment of work within the funds allocated;
9. addressing hazardous barriers to naviga-
tion due to shallow channels;
10. risk of imminent failure or closure of
the facility;
11. for small, remote, and subsistence har-
bors,
a. low-use ports with unexpected levels of
deterioration since their last dredging; and
b. projects with public safety concerns; and
12. for harbor maintenance activities,
a. total tonnage handled;
b. total exports;
c. total imports;
d. dollar value of cargo handled;
e. energy infrastructure and national secu-
rity needs served;
f. designation as strategic seaports;
g. lack of alternative means of freight
movement;
h. savings over alternative means of
freight movement; and
i. improvements to dredge disposal facili-
ties that will result in long-term savings, in-
cluding a reduction in regular maintenance.
Additional funding provided for donor and
energy transfer ports shall be allocated in
accordance with 33 U.S.C. 2238c. The Corps is
encouraged to include funding for this pro-
gram in future budget submissions. The
Corps is directed to fully execute subsection
(c) of 33 U.S.C. 2238c not later than 90 days
after enactment of this Act.
Concerns persist that the administration’s
criteria for navigation maintenance do not
allow small, remote, or subsistence harbors
and waterways to properly compete for
scarce navigation maintenance funds. The
Corps is directed to revise the criteria used
for determining which navigation projects
are funded in order to develop a reasonable
and equitable allocation under this account.
The agreement supports including criteria to
evaluate the economic impact that these
projects provide to local and regional econo-
mies.
Aquatic Nuisance Research Program.—Con-
cerns persist about the increasing threat to
human health and public safety from harm-
ful algal blooms (HABs) on our nation’s sur-
face waters. The agreement provides addi-
tional funds in Aquatic Nuisance Research
Program to address HABs and to develop
next generation ecological models to main-
tain inland and intracoastal waterways,
which contribute over $649,000,000,000 annu-
ally to the U.S. economy. The agreement
also provides additional funds to support re-
search and development that will identify
the formation of HABs and develop improved
strategies for early detection, prevention,
and management techniques and procedures
to reduce the occurrence and impacts of
HABs in the nation’s water resources. The
Corps is urged to work collaboratively with
appropriate university partners to address
these issues. The Corps is encouraged to ex-
plore opportunities to address HABs in the
Great Lakes given the historic lake levels in
the region.
Coastal Inlet Research Program.—The agree-
ment includes Senate direction.
Gross Revenue Fees.—Improving public ac-
cess to and usage of Corps facilities and the
continued enhancement of those facilities
are significant policy objectives. Concerns
have been raised that current Corps policy
and actions related to the fees placed on
gross revenue have discouraged the enhance-
ment of facilities and amenities at certain
properties. Therefore, the Corps is urged to
consider the impact of gross revenue fees on
recreational opportunities and property en-
hancements when determining the level of
assessed gross revenue fees.
Levee Safety.—The agreement includes
House and Senate direction.
Monitoring of Completed Navigation
Projects.—It is understood that the Corps
continues to explore non-destructive testing
methods of inspection that can assist in per-
forming this vital mission with increased
safety and accuracy and at significantly less
cost than current methods. The agreement
provides $2,000,000 for the Corps to complete
an asset management plan regarding non-de-
structive testing methods. Within available
funds, $4,000,000 shall be to support the struc-
tural health monitoring program to facili-
tate research to maximize operations, en-
hance efficiency, and protect asset life
through catastrophic failure mitigation. Not
later than 90 days after enactment of this
Act, the Corps shall brief the Committees on
Appropriations of both Houses of Congress
on the status of these efforts, including fu-
ture funding requirements. The agreement
includes Senate direction regarding fish-
eries.
Regional Dredge Demonstration Program.—
Additional funds are provided in this account
to support the demonstration program in ac-
cordance with the front matter under the
heading ‘‘Regional Dredge Demonstration
Program.’’
Scheduling of Reservoir Operations.—The
agreement provides that not less than
$4,000,000 of the additional funds provided in
the Scheduling of Reservoir Operations line
shall be for a water control manual update
for a non-Corps owned high hazard dam
where: (1) the Corps has a responsibility for
flood control operations under section 7 of
the Flood Control Act of 1944; (2) the dam re-
quires coordination of water releases with
one or more other high-hazard dams for flood
control purposes; and (3) the dam owner is
actively investigating the feasibility of ap-
plying forecast-informed reservoir oper-
ations technology.
Water Control Manuals.—The agreement in-
cludes Senate direction.
REGULATORY PROGRAM
The agreement includes $210,000,000 for the
Regulatory Program. Additional funds in-
cluded above the budget request are to be
used by Districts to decrease permit review
times.
FORMERLY UTILIZED SITES REMEDIAL ACTION
PROGRAM
The agreement includes $200,000,000 for the
Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action
Program.
FLOOD CONTROL AND COASTAL EMERGENCIES
The agreement includes $35,000,000 for
Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies.
EXPENSES
The agreement includes $203,000,000 for Ex-
penses.
OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE
ARMY FOR CIVIL WORKS
The agreement includes $5,000,000 for the
Office of the Assistant Secretary of the
Army for Civil Works. The agreement in-
cludes legislative language that restricts the
availability of funding until the Secretary
submits the required baseline report and a
work plan that allocates at least 95 percent
of the additional funding provided in each
account (i.e., 95 percent of additional funding
provided in Investigations, 95 percent of ad-
ditional funding provided in Construction,
etc.). This restriction shall not affect the
roles and responsibilities established in pre-
vious fiscal years of the Office of the Assist-
ant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works,
the Corps headquarters, the Corps field oper-
ating agencies, or any other executive
branch agency.
A timely and accessible executive branch
in the course of fulfilling its constitutional
role in the appropriations process is essen-
tial. The requesting and receiving of basic,
factual information, such as budget jus-
tification materials, is vital in order to
maintain a transparent and open governing
process. The agreement recognizes that some
discussions internal to the executive branch
are pre-decisional in nature and, therefore,
not subject to disclosure. However, the ac-
cess to facts, figures, and statistics that in-
form these decisions are not subject to this
same sensitivity and are critical to the budg-
et process. The administration shall ensure
timely and complete responses to these in-
quiries.
GENERAL PROVISIONS—CORPS OF ENGINEERS—
CIVIL
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The agreement includes a provision relat-
ing to reprogramming.
The agreement includes a provision regard-
ing the allocation of funds.
The agreement includes a provision prohib-
iting the use of funds to carry out any con-
tract that commits funds beyond the
amounts appropriated for that program,
project, or activity.
The agreement includes a provision con-
cerning funding transfers related to fish
hatcheries.
The agreement includes a provision regard-
ing certain dredged material disposal activi-
ties. The Corps is directed to brief the Com-
mittees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress not later than 90 days after enact-
ment of this Act on dredged material dis-
posal issues.
The agreement includes a provision prohib-
iting funds for reorganization of the Civil
Works program.
The agreement includes a provision regard-
ing eligibility for additional funding. Wheth-
er a project is eligible for funding under a
particular provision of additional funding is
a function of the technical details of the
project; it is not a policy decision. The Chief
of Engineers is the federal government’s
technical expert responsible for execution of
the Civil Works program and for offering

ing reallocations at a project.
TITLE II—DEPARTMENT OF THE
INTERIOR
CENTRAL UTAH PROJECT
CENTRAL UTAH PROJECT COMPLETION ACCOUNT
The agreement includes a total of
$20,000,000 for the Central Utah Project Com-
pletion Account, which includes $16,700,000
for Central Utah Project construction,
$1,800,000 for transfer to the Utah Reclama-
tion Mitigation and Conservation Account
for use by the Utah Reclamation Mitigation
and Conservation Commission, and $1,500,000
for necessary expenses of the Secretary of
the Interior.
BUREAU OF RECLAMATION
In lieu of all House and Senate direction
regarding additional funding and the fiscal
year 2020 work plan, the agreement includes
direction under the heading ‘‘Additional
Funding for Water and Related Resources
Work’’ in the Water and Related Resources
account.
Unmanned Aerial Systems.—Concerns re-
main about the threat posed to the national
security of the United States by unmanned
aerial systems (UAS) that are produced by
foreign-owned or controlled corporations and
operated by the Department of the Interior,
to include Reclamation. The agreement sup-
ports the Department of the Interior’s recent
grounding of UAS produced by foreign-owned
or controlled corporations and encourages
Reclamation to work with other federal
agencies to develop a strategy to end all
United States Government reliance on UAS
from foreign-owned or controlled corpora-
tions, while working with federal partners to
find a suitable domestic alternative.
WATER AND RELATED RESOURCES
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
The agreement provides $1,512,151,000 for
Water and Related Resources.
The agreement includes legislative lan-
guage, in accordance with Public Law 114–
322, to allow the use of certain funding pro-
vided in fiscal years 2017 and 2018.

lowing activities are eligible to compete for
funding under the appropriate heading: ac-
tivities authorized under Indian Water
Rights Settlements; all authorized rural
water projects, including those with tribal
components, those with non-tribal compo-
nents, and those with both; aquifer re-
charging efforts to address the ongoing back-
log of related projects; conjunctive use
projects and other projects to maximize
groundwater storage and beneficial use; on-
going work, including preconstruction ac-
tivities, on projects that provide new or ex-
isting water supplies through additional in-
frastructure; and activities authorized under

significant financial impacts should Rec-
lamation move forward with the proposal to
change the eligibility requirements for the
program related to user’s ability to pay. Rec-
lamation shall review the Pick-Sloan Mis-
souri Basin Program authorizing legislation
and brief the Committees on Appropriations
of both Houses of Congress on its findings,
including the extent to which Congress au-
thorized relief from operation maintenance,
and replacement costs for project use power
in that program based on an irrigation dis-
trict’s ability to pay, how that authority has
been applied over time, and the impacts of

reactor can be any light water or non-light
water fission reactor with significant im-
provements compared to the current genera-
tion of operational reactors. Significant im-
provements may include inherent safety fea-
tures, lower waste yields, greater fuel utili-
zation, superior reliability, resistance to pro-
liferation, increased thermal efficiency, and
the ability to integrate into electric and
nonelectric applications. For purposes of this

generation facilities of an electric utility
system or in any other manner for the pur-
pose of demonstrating the suitability for
commercial application of the advanced nu-
clear reactor.
The Secretary is directed to convene an
evaluation board to review the proposals and
recommend the best proposals to the Sec-
retary based on the following criteria: (1)
technical feasibility that the demonstration
can be operational in five to seven years; (2)

safe operations by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission; (3) use of certified fuel design
or demonstration of a clear path to certifi-
cation within five to seven years; (4) afford-
ability of the design for full-scale construc-
tion and cost of electricity generation; (5)
ability of the team to provide its portion of
the cost share; and (6) technical abilities and
qualifications of teams desiring to dem-
onstrate a proposed advanced nuclear reac-
tor technology. The evaluation board should
consider diversity in designs for the ad-
vanced nuclear reactors to be demonstrated
and must provide the Secretary with a rec-
ommendation of which two proposals best
meet these criteria within 30 days of receipt
of the proposals. The Secretary is directed to
contract with the recommended teams un-
less the Secretary certifies that such a selec-
tion is not in the national interest.

high-temperature process heat, district heat-
ing, hydrogen production, or heat for manu-
facturing, industrial processing, or other
purposes; (3) experts from industry with ex-
perience in design, manufacturing, and oper-
ation of nuclear reactors; and (4) a represent-
ative from the finance industry with back-
ground in the nuclear field.

December 17, 2019
TITLE IV—INDEPENDENT AGENCIES
APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION
The agreement provides $175,000,000 for the
Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC).
The following is the only direction for the
Appalachian Regional Commission.
The agreement includes the budget request
proposal to address the substance abuse cri-
sis that disproportionally affects Appalachia
and the budget request proposal for activi-
ties in support of the POWER Initiative.
To diversify and enhance regional business
development, $10,000,000 is provided to con-
tinue the program of high-speed broadband
deployment in distressed counties within the
Central Appalachian region that have been
most negatively impacted by the downturn
in the coal industry. The agreement provides
$5,000,000 for a program of high-speed
broadband deployment in economically dis-
tressed counties within the North Central
and Northern Appalachian regions.
Within available funds, not less than
$16,000,000 is for a program of industrial site
and workforce development in Southern and
South Central Appalachia, focused primarily
on the automotive supplier sector and the
aviation sector. Up to $13,500,000 of that
amount is for activities in Southern Appa-
lachia. The funds shall be distributed to
states that have distressed counties in
Southern and South Central Appalachia
using the ARC Area Development Formula.
Within available funding, $16,000,000 is for a
program of basic infrastructure improve-
ments in distressed counties in Central Ap-
palachia. Funds shall be distributed accord-
ing to ARC’s distressed counties formula and
shall be in addition to the regular allocation
to distressed counties.
The ARC is directed to provide to the Com-
mittees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress not later than 90 days after enact-
ment of this Act a report on the percentage
of funding that has been directed to per-
sistent-poverty counties and high-poverty
areas in the last three fiscal years. For the
purposes of the report, the term persistent-
poverty counties means any county that has
had 20 percent or more of its population liv-
ing in poverty over the past 30 years, as
measured by the 1990 and 2000 decennial cen-
suses and the most recent Small Area In-
come and Poverty Estimates. For the pur-
poses of the report, the term high-poverty
area means any census tract with a poverty
rate of at least 20 percent as measured by the
2013–2017 five-year data series available from
the American Community Survey of the Cen-
sus Bureau.
DEFENSE NUCLEAR FACILITIES SAFETY BOARD
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement provides $31,000,000 for the
Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. The
Board is directed to ensure a minimum of 110
full-time equivalents or report why it was
unable to do so to the Committees on Appro-
priations of both Houses of Congress. The
Board is further directed to establish and fill
an Executive Director of Operations posi-
tion. The agreement does not provide fund-
ing for any other elements of the Board’s Au-
gust 15, 2018, reorganization plan. The agree-
ment does not include the House report re-
quirement regarding a Memorandum of Un-
derstanding.
DELTA REGIONAL AUTHORITY
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement provides $30,000,000 for the
Delta Regional Authority.
DENALI COMMISSION
The agreement provides $15,000,000 for the
Denali Commission.
NORTHERN BORDER REGIONAL COMMISSION
The agreement provides $25,000,000 for the
Northern Border Regional Commission.
Within available funds, not less than
$4,000,000 is for initiatives that seek to ad-
dress the decline in forest-based economies
throughout the region and $750,000 is for the
State Capacity Building Grant Program.
SOUTHEAST CRESCENT REGIONAL COMMISSION
The agreement provides $250,000 for the
Southeast Crescent Regional Commission.
NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s
(Commission) mission is to ensure the safety
and security of the nation’s use of nuclear
power and nuclear materials and protect the
workers and public who use and benefit from
these materials and facilities. The agree-
ment provides $842,236,000 for Commission
salaries and expenses. This amount is offset
by estimated revenues of $717,125,000, result-
ing in a net appropriation of $125,111,000. The
agreement provides $15,478,000 for activities
related to the development of regulatory in-
frastructure for advanced nuclear reactor
technologies and $14,500,000 for international
activities, which are not subject to the Com-
mission’s fee recovery collection require-
ments. The agreement directs the use of
$40,000,000 in prior-year unobligated bal-
ances.
Unobligated Balances from Prior Appropria-
tions.—The Commission carries unobligated
balances from appropriations received in
prior years. The agreement requires the use
of $40,000,000 of these balances, derived from
fee-based activities. The Commission is di-
rected to apply these savings in a manner
that continues to ensure the protection of
public health and safety and maintains the
effectiveness of the current inspection pro-
gram. Because the Commission has already
collected fees corresponding to these activi-
ties in prior years, the agreement does not
include these funds within the fee base cal-
culation for determining authorized reve-
nues and does not provide authority to col-
lect additional offsetting receipts for their
use. Any remaining unobligated balances
carried forward from prior years are subject
to the reprogramming guidelines in section
402 of this Act, and shall be used only to sup-
plement appropriations consistent with
those guidelines.

ing to reprogramming.
TITLE V—GENERAL PROVISIONS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The agreement includes a provision relat-
ing to lobbying restrictions.
The agreement includes a provision relat-
ing to transfer authority. No additional
transfer authority is implied or conveyed by
this provision. For the purposes of this pro-
vision, the term ‘‘transfer’’ shall mean the
shifting of all or part of the budget authority
in one account to another. In addition to
transfers provided in this Act or other appro-
priations Acts, and existing authorities, such
as the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535), by
which one part of the United States Govern-
ment may provide goods or services to an-
other part, this Act allows transfers using
section 4705 of the Atomic Energy Defense
Act (50 U.S.C. 2745) and 15 U.S.C. 638 regard-
ing SBIR/STTR.
The agreement includes a provision prohib-
iting funds to be used in contravention of the
executive order entitled ‘‘Federal Actions to
Address Environmental Justice in Minority
Populations and Low-Income Populations.’’
The agreement includes a provision prohib-
iting the use of funds to establish or main-
tain a computer network unless such net-
work blocks the viewing, downloading, and
exchanging of pornography, except for law
enforcement investigation, prosecution, or
adjudication activities.

December 17, 2019
DIVISION D—DEPARTMENT OF THE INTE-
RIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED
AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2020
The following statement is an explanation
of the effects of Division D, which provides
appropriations for the Department of the In-
terior, the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy (EPA), the Forest Service, the Indian
Health Service, and related agencies for fis-
cal year 2020.
The explanatory statement accompanying
this Act is approved and indicates congres-
sional intent. Report language contained in
House Report 116–100 and Senate Report 116–
123 providing specific guidance to agencies
regarding the administration of appropriated
funds and any corresponding reporting re-
quirements carries the same emphasis as the
language included in this explanatory state-
ment and should be complied with unless
specifically addressed to the contrary herein.
This explanatory statement, while repeating
some language for emphasis, is not intended
to negate the language referred to above un-
less expressly provided herein.
In cases where the House report, Senate re-
port, or this explanatory statement direct
the submission of a report, such report is to
be submitted to both the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations. Where this
explanatory statement refers to the Commit-
tees or the Committees on Appropriations,
unless otherwise noted, this reference is to
the House Subcommittee on Interior, Envi-
ronment, and Related Agencies and the Sen-
ate Subcommittee on Interior, Environment,
and Related Agencies.
Each department and agency funded in this
Act is directed to follow the directions set
forth in this Act and the accompanying
statement and to not reallocate resources or
reorganize activities except as provided here-
in or otherwise approved by the House and
Senate Appropriations Committees through
the reprogramming process as referenced in
this Act. This explanatory statement ad-
dresses only those agencies and accounts for
which there is a need for greater explanation
than provided in the Act itself. Funding lev-
els for appropriations by account, program,
and activity, with comparisons to the fiscal
year 2019 enacted level and the fiscal year
2020 budget request, can be found in the table
at the end of this division.
Unless expressly stated otherwise, any ref-
erence to ‘‘this Act’’ or ‘‘at the end of this
statement’’ shall be treated as referring only
to the provisions of this division.
Bureau of Land Management, Reorganiza-
tion.—The Department has not fulfilled its
obligation to fully communicate the organi-
zational and financial details of the reorga-
nization and relocation of the Bureau’s
Washington, DC headquarters. It has not pro-
vided Bureau employees, Congress, agency
stakeholders or the general public with ade-
quate information regarding this move. Fur-
thermore, it has not explained how it will
sustain its operations and remain an effec-
tive land management agency following the
anticipated loss of much of its senior man-
agement and the expected significant attri-
tion of its workforce caused by the reorga-
nization. The Department is therefore di-
rected to begin monthly briefings with the
Committees on Appropriations on the status
of the reorganization, including in an initial
briefing explaining the Bureau’s plan for en-
suring continuity of agency operations and
addressing the immediate impacts of likely
staff shortages caused by the reorganization.
Requirement Relating to Information Re-
quests.—The head of a Federal agency that
receives funds under this Act or any other
Act making appropriations for the Depart-
ment of the Interior, environment, and re-
lated agencies for any other fiscal year shall
respond completely and in full to a written
request for information received by the head
of the Federal Agency from the Comptroller
General of the United States relating to a
decision or opinion on appropriations law
not later than the earlier of: (1) the date that
is 45 days after the date on which the head of
the Federal agency receives the written re-
quest; and (2) the date otherwise established
by the Comptroller General of the United
States in the written request. If the informa-
tion requested by the Comptroller General of
the United States is not readily available
and the head of the Federal agency that re-
ceived the written request is not able to re-
spond completely and in full within the time
period described, the head of the Federal
agency shall by the deadline established in
the preceding sentence respond in writing to
provide as much information as practicable
at the time of the response; and an expla-
nation for the reason why the head of the
Federal agency is unable to respond com-
pletely and in full at the time of the re-
sponse; and a proposed timetable for the sub-
mission of all remaining requested informa-
tion. Not later than 30 days after the date on
which a response is submitted to the Comp-
troller General of the United States and
every 30 days thereafter until the date on
which the head of the Federal agency re-
sponds completely and in full to the request
for information, as determined by the Comp-
troller General of the United States, the
head of the Federal agency shall update in
writing the response provided.
Chaco Canyon.—On May 28, 2019, the Sec-
retary announced that the Department will
refrain from oil and gas leasing within the
10-mile radius of Chaco Culture National His-
torical Park pending completion of planning
activities and tribal consultation. The Bu-
reau of Land Management is directed not to
conduct any oil and gas leasing activities au-
thorized by section 17 of the Mineral Leasing
Act (30 U.S.C. 226) in the withdrawal area
identified on the map of the Chaco Culture
National Historical Park prepared by the Bu-
reau of Land Management and dated April 2,
2019, until the completion of the cultural re-
sources investigation included in this agree-
ment as part of the Bureau of Indian Af-
fairs—Operation of Indian Programs appro-
priation. Nothing in this directive prohibits
an Indian tribe or individual member of an
Indian tribe or allottee from developing min-
eral rights under the Indian Mineral Leasing
Act.
105(l) Lease costs.—Estimates for lease costs
resulting from section 105 of the Indian Self-
Determination and Education Assistance Act
continue to increase and have the potential
to increase over the coming months. The un-
certainty surrounding the 105(l) lease agree-
ment estimates has inserted a high level of
unpredictability into the budget process and
has placed the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations in the difficult position
where rapidly escalating requirements for
lease costs are negatively impacting the
ability to use discretionary appropriations
to support core tribal programs, including
health, education and construction pro-
grams, or provide essential fixed cost re-
quirements. Obligations of this nature are
typically addressed through mandatory
spending, but in this case since they fall
under discretionary spending, they are im-
pacting all other programs funded under the
Interior and Environment Appropriations
bill, including other equally important Trib-
al programs, and they appear to be growing
exponentially without the Administration
developing a long-term funding strategy to
address them. The agreement notes that pay-
ments for 105(l) leases directly resulting
from decisions in the case of Maniilaq Ass’n
v. Burwell in both 2014 (72 F. Supp. 3d 227
(D.D.C. 2014)) and 2016 (70 F. Supp. 3d 243
(D.D.C. 2016)) appear to create an entitle-
ment to compensation for 105(l) leases that is
typically not funded through discretionary
appropriations. The Department of the Inte-
rior and the Department of Health and
Human Services are directed to consult with
Tribes and work with the House and Senate
committees of jurisdiction, the Office of
Management and Budget, and the Commit-
tees on Appropriations to formulate long-
term accounting, budget, and legislative
strategies to address the situation, including
discussions about whether, in light of the
Maniilaq decisions, these funds should be re-
classified as an appropriated entitlement.
Bighorn Sheep.—In lieu of House direction,
the Department of the Interior and the For-
est Service shall follow the direction in-
cluded in Senate Report 116–123 with regards
to Bighorn Sheep.
Land and Water Conservation Fund.—The
bill includes $495,103,000 in new budget au-
thority to be derived from the Land and
Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) for pro-
grams consistent with chapter 2003 of title 54
of the United States Code, as identified in

REPROGRAMMING GUIDELINES
The following are the procedures governing
reprogramming actions for programs and ac-
tivities funded in the Department of the In-
terior, Environment, and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act. The House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations are dismayed
by multiple agencies’ lack of strict adher-
ence to the Committees’ reprogramming
guidelines and agencies funded by this Act
are reminded that no reprogramming shall
be implemented without the advance ap-
proval of the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations in accordance with the
procedures included in this Act. The agencies
funded in this Act are reminded that these
reprogramming guidelines are in effect, and
must be complied with, until such time as
the Committees modify them through bill or
report language.
Definitions.—‘‘Reprogramming,’’ as defined
in these procedures, includes the realloca-
tion of funds from one budget activity, budg-
et line-item, or program area to another
within any appropriation funded in this Act.
In cases where either the House or Senate
Committee on Appropriations report dis-
plays an allocation of an appropriation below
that level, the more detailed level shall be
the basis for reprogramming.
For construction, land acquisition, and for-
est legacy accounts, a reprogramming con-
stitutes the reallocation of funds, including
unobligated balances, from one construction,
land acquisition, or forest legacy project to
another such project.
A reprogramming shall also consist of any
significant departure from the program de-
scribed in the agency’s budget justifications.
This includes all proposed reorganizations or
other workforce actions detailed below
which affect a total of 10 staff members or 10
percent of the staffing of an affected pro-
gram or office, whichever is less, even with-
out a change in funding. Any change to the
organization table presented in the budget
justification shall also be subject to this re-
quirement.
It is noted that agencies funded by this Act
are continuing to work to implement Execu-
tive Order 13781, a Comprehensive Plan for
Reorganizing the Executive Branch, and
have included in the fiscal year 2020 budget
request funding for these activities. It is also
noted that agencies funded by this Act con-
tinue to weigh additional organizational
changes during the fiscal year. Agencies are
reminded that this recommendation con-
tinues longstanding General Guidelines for
Reprogramming that require agencies funded
by this Act to submit reorganization pro-
posals for the Committees’ review prior to
their implementation. It is noted that such
reprogramming guidelines apply to proposed
reorganizations, workforce restructure, re-
shaping, transfer of functions, or bureau-
wide downsizing and include closures, con-
solidations, and relocations of offices, facili-
ties, and laboratories. In addition, no agency
shall implement any part of a reorganization
that modifies regional or State boundaries
for agencies or bureaus that were in effect as
of the date of enactment of this Act unless
approved consistent with the General Guide-
lines for Reprogramming procedures speci-
fied herein. Any such reprogramming request
submitted to the Committees on Appropria-
tions shall include a description of antici-
pated benefits, including anticipated effi-
ciencies and cost-savings, as well as a de-
scription of anticipated personnel impacts
and funding changes anticipated to imple-
ment the proposal.
General Guidelines for Reprogramming.—
(a) A reprogramming should be made only
when an unforeseen situation arises, and
then only if postponement of the project or
the activity until the next appropriation
year would result in actual loss or damage.
(b) Any project or activity, which may be
deferred through reprogramming, shall not
later be accomplished by means of further
reprogramming, but instead, funds should
again be sought for the deferred project or
activity through the regular appropriations
process.
(c) Except under the most urgent situa-
tions, reprogramming should not be em-
ployed to initiate new programs or increase
allocations specifically denied or limited by
Congress, or to decrease allocations specifi-
cally increased by the Congress.
(d) Reprogramming proposals submitted to
the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations for approval will be considered as
expeditiously as possible, and the Commit-
tees remind the agencies that in order to
process reprogramming requests, adequate
and timely information must be provided.
Criteria and Exceptions.—A reprogramming
must be submitted to the Committees in
writing prior to implementation if it exceeds
$1,000,000 annually or results in an increase
or decrease of more than 10 percent annually
in affected programs or projects, whichever
amount is less, with the following excep-
tions:
(a) With regard to the Tribal priority allo-
cations of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)
and Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), there
is no restriction on reprogrammings among
these programs. However, the Bureaus shall
report on all reprogrammings made during a
given fiscal year no later than 60 days after
the end of the fiscal year.
(b) With regard to the EPA, the Commit-
tees do not require reprogramming requests
associated with the States and Tribes Part-
nership Grants or up to a cumulative total of
$5,000,000 from carryover balances among the
individual program areas delineated in the
Environmental Programs and Management
account, with no more than $1,000,000 coming
from any individual program area. No funds,
however, shall be reallocated from individual
Geographic Programs.
(c) With regard to the National Park Serv-
ice, the Committees do not require re-
programming requests associated with the
park base within the Park Management ac-
tivity in the Operation of the National Park
System Account. The Service is required to
brief the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations on spending trends for the
park base within 60 days of enactment of this
Act.
Assessments.—‘‘Assessment’’ as defined in
these procedures shall refer to any charges,
reserves, or holdbacks applied to a budget
activity or budget line item for costs associ-
ated with general agency administrative
costs, overhead costs, working capital ex-
penses, or contingencies.
(a) No assessment shall be levied against
any program, budget activity, subactivity,
budget line item, or project funded by the In-
terior, Environment, and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act unless such assessment
and the basis therefore are presented to the
Committees in the budget justifications and
are subsequently approved by the Commit-
tees. The explanation for any assessment in
the budget justification shall show the
amount of the assessment, the activities as-
sessed, and the purpose of the funds.
(b) Proposed changes to estimated assess-
ments, as such estimates were presented in
annual budget justifications, shall be sub-
mitted through the reprogramming process
and shall be subject to the same dollar and
reporting criteria as any other reprogram-
ming.
(c) Each agency or bureau which utilizes
assessments shall submit an annual report to
the Committees, which provides details on
the use of all funds assessed from any other
budget activity, line item, subactivity, or
project.
(d) In no case shall contingency funds or
assessments be used to finance projects and
activities disapproved or limited by Congress
or to finance programs or activities that
could be foreseen and included in the normal
budget review process.
(e) New programs requested in the budget
should not be initiated before enactment of
the bill without notification to, and the ap-
proval of, the Committees. This restriction
applies to all such actions regardless of
whether a formal reprogramming of funds is
required to begin the program.
Quarterly Reports.—All reprogrammings be-
tween budget activities, budget line-items,
program areas, or the more detailed activity
levels shown in this recommendation, in-
cluding those below the monetary thresholds
established above, shall be reported to the
Committees within 60 days of the end of each
quarter and shall include cumulative totals
for each budget activity or budget line item,
or construction, land acquisition, or forest
legacy project.
Land Acquisitions, Easements, and Forest
Legacy.—Lands shall not be acquired for
more than the approved appraised value, as
addressed in section 301(3) of Public Law 91–
646, unless such acquisitions are submitted
to the Committees on Appropriations for ap-
proval in compliance with these procedures.
Land Exchanges.—Land exchanges, wherein
the estimated value of the Federal lands to
be exchanged is greater than $1,000,000, shall
not be consummated until the Committees
have had 30 days in which to examine the
proposed exchange. ln addition, the Commit-
tees shall be provided advance notification of
exchanges valued between $500,000 and
$1,000,000.
Budget Structure.—The budget activity or
line item structure for any agency appro-
priation account shall not be altered without
advance approval of the Committees.

ficking.
In consultation with the United States
Agency for International Development
(USAID), the Department of the Interior
shall develop policies and procedures for the
execution and oversight of programs from
funds made available by transfer from
USAID to ensure that agreements for the ob-
ligation of funds between implementing
partners and the Department include provi-
sions requiring that: (1) information detail-
ing the proposed project and potential im-
pacts is shared with local communities and
the free, prior, and informed consent of af-
fected indigenous communities is obtained in
accordance with international standards; (2)
the potential impacts of the proposed project
on existing land or resource claims by af-
fected local communities or indigenous peo-
ples are considered and addressed in any
management plan; (3) any eco-guards, park
rangers, and other law enforcement per-
sonnel authorized to protect biodiversity
will be properly trained and monitored; and
(4) effective grievance and redress mecha-
nisms for victims of human rights violations
and other misconduct exist. The Director
shall consult with the Committees not later
than 45 days after enactment of this Act on
the development of such policies and proce-
dures.
The Endangered Species Act requires that
importing sport-hunted trophies from endan-
gered species is only permissible if the ex-
porting country has demonstrated that hunt-
ing improves the survival of that species and
proceeds of the hunt will be reinvested in
conservation. The current U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service policy to evaluate applica-
tions for importing trophies for elephants
and lions on a case-by-case basis may not
adequately determine whether a country has
proper safeguards in place to protect species
vulnerable to poaching. Population counts
continue to decline causing concern that the
current policy is detrimental. The Fish and
Wildlife Service is directed to reevaluate its
current policy and analyze how targeted in-
vestments and technical assistance to the
exporting countries’ conservation programs
would impact the survival of elephants and
lions, improve local communities, and sus-
tain species populations. The Service is to
brief the Committees 60 days after enact-
ment of this Act on their findings.
Fish and Aquatic Conservation.—The agree-
ment provides $205,477,000 for fish and aquat-
ic conservation programs.

The agreement provides $64,272,000 which in-
cludes: $1,200,000 for the Aquatic Animal
Drug Approval Partnership; $3,750,000 for
Klamath Basin restoration activities; and
$4,700,000 for mitigation of the Pacific Salm-
on Treaty. The agreement maintains funding
for mass marking at the fiscal year 2019 en-
acted level and directs the Service to work
in cooperation with State fish and game
agencies on marking of anadromous fish.
None of the funds may be used to terminate

vance, informal consultation with affected
States and Tribes.
The Service is expected to continue fund-
ing mitigation hatchery programs via reim-

ministrative costs. The Service is expected
to ensure that its costs are fully reimbursed
before proposing to reduce or redirect base
funding.
Maintenance and Equipment.—The agree-
ment provides $25,846,000 for maintenance
and equipment expenses related to the Na-
tional Fish Hatchery System. The Service is

days of enactment of this Act, the Service
shall provide a report to the Committees
outlining how this program deviates from
that which was presented to Congress in the
annual budget justifications. This report
must include how the Service will engage
previous stakeholders and how conservation
efforts are aligned with partners, especially
what will be done to ensure there is collabo-
rative conservation efforts on a landscape
scale in fiscal year 2020. In addition, the re-
port should include how the Service will en-
gage in areas where LCCs have been dimin-
ished or dismantled. This report must also
include the detailed information outlined in
House Report 116–100 and Senate Report 116–
123. Until this report is received by the Com-
mittees, $1,000,000 of the funding provided for

includes $3,237,000 for Aviation Management,
as requested.
The agreement acknowledges the impor-
tance of the development of an electronic
permitting system that will make the per-
mitting process more efficient and can be
used to combat the illegal trafficking of
products and wildlife. The Department is di-
rected to brief the Committees on the final

INDIAN AFFAIRS
BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS
OPERATION OF INDIAN PROGRAMS
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
The agreement accepts the budget proposal
to strengthen the Bureau of Indian Edu-
cation (BIE) as an independent bureau with a
separate budget structure, including a sepa-
rate construction budget, from the Bureau of
Indian Affairs (BIA). The separation is re-
flected below.
The bill provides $1,577,110,000 for Oper-
ation of Indian Programs. All programs,
projects, and activities are maintained at
fiscal year 2019 levels, except for requested
fixed cost increases and internal transfers, or
unless otherwise specified below. For this
and all other Bureau accounts funded in this
bill, Indian Affairs is expected to comply
with the instructions and requirements at
the beginning of this division and in House
Report 116–100 and Senate Report 116–123, un-
less otherwise specified below. Additional de-
tails, instructions, and requirements are in-
cluded below and in the table at the end of
this division. Indian Affairs is reminded of
the importance of meeting reporting require-
ment deadlines so that the Committees can
properly evaluate programs. Failure to do so
could negatively impact future budgets.
Tiwahe.—The bill continues the Tiwahe
Initiative at fiscal year 2019 levels across all
programs and activities with funding distrib-
uted in the same amounts to the same recipi-
ents, including the funding to support
women and children’s shelters. There is con-
cern that Tiwahe funding was not properly
documented or distributed as outlined in the
Office of Inspector General report published
in 2018; therefore, BIA is directed to submit
the final reports as directed by House Report
115–765 and Senate Report 116–123 within 90
days of enactment of this Act.
NATIVE Act.—Funding is continued across
all programs and activities at fiscal year 2019
levels for the Native American Tourism and
Improving Visitor Experience Act of 2016
(P.L. 114–221) (NATIVE Act). The agreement
directs BIA to comply with the reporting re-
quirement for the road maintenance program
funding in Senate Report 116–123.
Alternative Financing/105(l) Lease Costs.—Es-
timates for lease costs resulting from section
105 of the Indian Self-Determination and
Education Assistance Act continue to in-
crease and have the potential to increase
over the coming months. The agreement di-
rects BIA to comply with the 105(l) lease
costs language included in the front of this
explanatory statement.
Staffing.—The high level of staff vacancies
prevents BIA from fulfilling its trust respon-
sibilities. Indian Affairs is directed to sub-
mit a report to the Committees on Appro-
priations detailing actual staffing and va-
cancy levels within the Bureau by region and
headquarters for each program, and the
amount of funding associated with any va-
cant positions within 120 days of enactment
of this Act.
Human Services.—The bill provides
$155,685,000 for human services programs and
includes $1,000,000 to implement section 202
of the Indian Child Welfare Act (25 U.S.C.

Housing Program for a total funding level of
$11,708,000. BIA is instructed to report back
within 30 days of enactment of this Act on
how this funding will be distributed.
Trust—Natural Resources Management.—The
bill provides $226,819,000 for natural resources
management programs, including $2,000,000
to finalize implementation of section 7 of the
Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Res-
toration Act (P.L. 102–495), and $41,743,000 for
Rights Protection Implementation, of which
an additional $500,000 is for the law enforce-
ment needs for treaty sites on the Columbia
River; and an additional $900,000 is to imple-
ment the Pacific Salmon Treaty. The agree-
ment continues funding for the Everglades at
the fiscal year 2019 levels.
Within the Tribal Management Develop-
ment program, the bill includes an addi-
tional $255,000 to advance the understanding
of salmon and steelhead habitat; an addi-
tional $500,000 to develop Tribal buffalo herds
and support related activities; and an addi-
tional $700,000 for pilot projects and pro-
grams for Alaska subsistence activities as
further outlined in the Senate Report 116–
123. In addition, the agreement includes
$25,541,000 for the Agriculture Program
(TPA); $9,773,000 for Invasive Species;
$6,549,000 for Wildlife and Parks (TPA); and
$8,525,000 for water management, planning
and pre-development.
The agreement includes $1,000,000 for the
Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs to con-
tract with relevant federally recognized
Tribes or Tribal organizations to allow Trib-
al cultural experts to perform a cultural re-
sources investigation to identify culturally
and historically significant areas and sites in
areas of high energy development potential
within the Chaco Canyon region of the
Southwest. As part of this investigation, the
agreement expects special emphasis to be
given to areas of high development potential
as defined in Figure 10 of the Bureau of Land
Management’s February 2018 Final Report,
‘‘Reasonable Development Scenario of Oil
and Gas Activities’’ for the Mancos-Gallup
RMPA Planning Area. The Assistant Sec-
retary shall consult with affected Tribes
prior to soliciting proposals and shall award
funds within 270 days of enactment of this
Act.
Trust—Real Estate Services.—The bill pro-
vides $138,097,000 for real estate services, of
which $500,000 is to implement the Gila River
Indian Community Federal Rights-of-Way,
Easements and Boundary Clarification Act

Quality Program (TPA); $17,743,000 is for En-
vironmental Quality Projects; $4,078,000 is
for Rights Protection (TPA); and $10,727,000
is for Water Rights Negotiation, including
$1,500,000 for rights protection litigation sup-
port.
Funding is continued for the Alaska Native
Claims Settlement Act historical places. The
Bureau is reminded of the directives in
House Report 116–100 regarding water rights
negotiations.
Public Safety and Justice.—The bill provides
$434,326,000 for public safety and justice pro-
grams, of which: an additional $1,000,000 is to
solve Missing and Murdered Indigenous
Women cold cases; an additional $1,000,000 is
for background checks to hire more law en-
forcement officers; an additional $2,000,000 is
to supplement fiscal year 2019 funding levels
to hire additional detention/corrections staff
at facilities located on Indian lands; an addi-
tional $2,000,000 is to purchase equipment to
collect and preserve evidence at crime scenes
throughout Indian Country; $3,000,000 is for
activities to implement and ensure compli-
ance with the Violence Against Women Act;
$14,000,000 is to address the needs of Tribes
affected by Public Law 93–280 and as further
outlined in the Senate Report 116–123; and
$18,203,000 is for facilities operations and
maintenance, of which $2,000,000 is to supple-
ment fiscal year 2019 funding levels for facili-
ties located on Indian lands.
The recommendation also includes
$2,500,000 to focus on advanced training needs
to help address the crisis for missing, traf-
ficked, and murdered indigenous women.
These activities shall focus on training for
detectives, forensics, and other specialized
courses in an effort to provide greater access
to programs for Indian country law enforce-
ment personnel to create safer communities.
This advanced training shall not duplicate
those activities at the Indian Police Acad-
emy, which continues as the central justice
services training location for tribal law en-
forcement, including for entry-level law en-
forcement officers, agents and corrections
officers, and the agreement provides full
funding for these programs.
To further address the crisis of missing,
trafficked, and murdered indigenous women,
it is necessary to both boost coordination
and data collection among Tribal, local,
State, and Federal law enforcement. For this
reason, the agreement directs BIA to des-
ignate an official within the Office of Justice
Services to work with Tribes to develop a set
of guidelines on how to best collect the sta-
tistics on missing, trafficked, and murdered
native women. The designee is expected to
report back to the Committees on his or her
findings within 1 year after enactment of
this Act. Additionally, the Government Ac-
countability Office is directed to conduct a
review of the BIA’s policy for investigating
and reporting missing and murdered Native
Americans as well as outline recommenda-
tions for ways in which the BIA can improve
and better coordinate BIA and Tribal law en-
forcement activities with other Federal
agencies to improve access to databases and
public notification systems.
The agreement directs BIA to conduct the
study identified in section 117 of Division B
of H.R. 3055, as passed by the Senate on Octo-
ber 31, 2019, related to law enforcement staff-
ing needs of Indian Tribes, and submit such
study to the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations within 270 days of enact-
ment of this Act.
Community and Economic Development.—The
bill provides $52,529,000 for community and
economic development programs, including
$13,525,000 for Job Placement and Training
(TPA) and $2,791,000 for Economic develop-
ment (TPA). The agreement also includes
$3,000,000 for grants to federally recognized
Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations to
provide native language instruction and im-
mersion programs to native students not en-
rolled at BIE schools, including those Tribes
and organizations in states without Bureau-
funded schools.

December 17, 2019
DIVISION E—LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2020
The following is an explanation of the ef-
fects of Division E, which makes appropria-
tions for the legislative branch for fiscal
year 2020. Unless otherwise noted, reference
to the House and Senate reports are to House
Report 116–64 and Senate Report 116–124. The
language included in these reports should be
complied with and carries the same emphasis
as the language included in the explanatory
statement, unless specifically addressed to
the contrary in this explanatory statement.
While repeating some report language for
emphasis, this explanatory statement does
not intend to negate the language referred to
above unless expressly provided herein.
Reprogramming Guidelines: It is expected
that all agencies notify the Committees on
Appropriations of the House and the Senate
(hereinafter ‘‘the Committees’’) of any sig-
nificant departures from budget plans pre-
sented to the Committees in any agency’s
budget justifications. In particular, agencies
funded through this bill are required to no-
tify the Committees prior to any reprogram-
ming of funds in excess of the lesser of 10
percent or $750,000 between programs,
projects or activities, or in excess of $750,000
between object classifications (except for
shifts within the pay categories, object class
11, 12, and 13 or as further specified in each
agency’s respective section). This includes
cumulative reprogrammings that together
total at least $750,000 from or to a particular
program, activity, or object classification as
well as reprogramming full time equivalents
(FTE) or funds to create new organizational
entities within the agency or to restructure
entities which already exist. In addition, the
Committees must be notified of reprogram-
ming actions that involve less than the
above-mentioned amounts if such actions
would have the effect of changing an agen-
cy’s funding requirements in future years or
if programs or projects specifically cited in
the Committees’ reports are affected.
Updating Congressional Budget Justifications:
Congressional Budget Justifications are es-
sential tools within the appropriations proc-
ess. The efforts of the Legislative Branch Fi-
nancial Managers Council (LBFMC) to share
financial information and improve financial
processes across the entire legislative branch
are applauded. With these efforts in mind,
the members of the LBFMC are directed to
explore refining and standardizing Congres-
sional Budget Justifications and present the
findings to the Committees within 180 days
of the enactment of this act. The findings
should include but not be limited to best
practices for using Zero Base Budgeting,
aligning FTE levels with current enacted ap-
propriations and the funding requested in
the budget year and providing detailed jus-
tifications for large multi-year or joint
projects.
Offices of Inspectors General Budgets: It is
important to ensure independence between
legislative branch Offices of Inspectors Gen-
eral (OIG) and their respective reporting
agencies. There shall be a separate section in
each agency’s fiscal year 2021 budget jus-
tification reflecting a detailed budget re-
quest for the agency’s OIG. Each OIG is di-
rected to keep the Committees fully apprised
of its funding needs. In addition, each agency
is directed to avoid interference with or re-
quire approval for such communications.
Science and Technology Needs in Congress:
The report released on November 14, 2019, by
the National Academy of Public Administra-
tion (NAPA) identified the existing gaps in
science and technology expertise and re-
sources available to Congress. The Commit-
tees, Members, stakeholders and other com-
mittees of jurisdiction working together will
continue to evaluate the recommendations
in the report to address this gap.
Data Centers: Legislative branch agencies
use information technology (IT) infrastruc-
ture, systems and services to support critical
functions to carry out their statutory mis-
sions, including functions essential to car-
rying out the constitutional responsibilities
of the legislative branch.
IT infrastructure, systems and services
may be located in data centers covering sev-
eral geographic regions or using several
types of cloud services. Regardless of how
such infrastructure, systems and services are
provisioned, an agency’s IT infrastructure,
systems or services must satisfy, or have a
plan to achieve, the following requirements:
must meet ‘‘concurrently maintainable’’ re-
quirements, as set forth by the Uptime Insti-
tute or a designated agency authority; must
maintain continuous operation against agen-
cy-defined hazards and risks; and must incor-
porate technical communications capabili-
ties to ensure that all necessary IT resources
required to support the mission of the legis-
lative branch can interoperate effectively
with the House, Senate, and other agencies.
Advertising Contracts: Each agency is di-
rected to include the following information
in its fiscal year 2021 budget justification:
Expenditures for fiscal year 2019 for (1) all
contracts for advertising services; and (2)
contracts for the advertising services with
(I) socially and economically disadvantaged
small business concerns (as defined in sec-
tion 8(a)(4) of the Small Business Act (15
U.S.C. 637(a)(4)); and (II) women- and minor-
ity-owned businesses.

CAPITOL POLICE

The agreement includes $379,062,000 for sal-
aries of the United States Capitol Police
(USCP). The increase includes funds to sup-
port 57 additional sworn officers as well as
one additional position for the USCP Office
of Inspector General. No more than
$47,048,000 is recommended for overtime in
fiscal year 2020. This provides for approxi-
mately 717,791 hours of additional duty in-
cluding coverage of the 2020 National Con-
ventions and pre-inauguration.
USCP Office of Inspector General: The agree-
ment provides funding to support not less
than six FTE within the USCP Office of In-
spector General.
The agreement reiterates directives in-
cluded in the Senate report and/or House re-
port related to:
USCP Wellness Program: The Department’s
efforts to date to develop an overall Wellness
Program for the officers and civilian per-
sonnel of the U.S. Capitol Police are encour-
aging. It is important to ensure the Capitol
Police workforce has the needed support in
order to perform its critical national secu-
rity mission of defending the legislative
process. As a part of this law enforcement
function, it is important for the Department
to continue its effort to maintain the high-
est level of readiness.
Therefore, the Department is encouraged
to begin implementation of a holistic
wellness and resiliency program for its work-
force that emphasizes the importance of
physical fitness, nutritional health, mental
and emotional health, and financial
wellness. Mindfulness plays an important
role in having a first responder workforce
that is holistically balanced and resilient.
With an emphasis on improving and main-
taining both physical fitness and mental
health, the Department will be able to pro-
vide the support to its workforce to enable
them to maintain full focus and attention to
the Department’s critical mission.
Within 45 days of enactment of this act,
the Department is directed to submit a re-
port to the Committees providing the scope,
timeline and the cost estimates for imple-
mentation and maintenance of such a pro-
gram. This report should include specific de-
tails on how the Department plans to utilize
its current resources, such as fitness centers
and contracted fitness training support in
this effort, and how it would expand these
capabilities to provide the greatest oppor-
tunity for its workforce to improve and
maintain their physical fitness and nutri-
tional health. The Department should also
include details of the other focus areas for
its Wellness Program, to include, but not
limited to mental, emotional and financial
health. This Program should be designed to
achieve the highest level of participation of
the USCP’s workforce. The Committees look
forward to working closely with the Depart-
ment to achieve this effort.
Micromobility Options on U.S. Capitol
Grounds: Dockless commercial scooters, or e-
scooters, and other motorized devices for
rent have grown as a commuting option for
congressional staffers, tourists and other
visitors to the District of Columbia and Cap-
itol Grounds. It is recognized that new and
expanding micromobility options in the Dis-
trict can offer alternatives to car travel and
increase access to public transportation.
However, these options can create a public
safety concern impacting vehicular and pe-
destrian traffic on the Capitol Grounds if not
appropriately regulated and if left un-
checked. The safety and security concerns—
specifically e-scooters left unattended on
sidewalks, roadways, and high-pedestrian ac-
cess areas throughout the Capitol Grounds—
raised by the Capitol Police and other mem-
bers of the congressional community should
continue to be addressed by both the USCP
and the House and Senate Sergeants at
Arms. The Capitol Police and the Sergeants
at Arms are directed to continue and expand
efforts to communicate to e-scooter compa-
nies, congressional staff, District residents
and visitors current restrictions for using
and/or parking e-scooters on or around Cap-
itol Grounds. The USCP and the Sergeants
at Arms are also directed to engage with the
e-scooter companies and the District to ex-
plore the feasibility of having locations adja-
cent to campus to designate as e-scooter
parking areas.
Use of Grounds: The Committees under-
stand the need to maintain safety and order
on the Capitol Grounds and the USCP is
commended for its efforts. Given the family-
style neighborhood that the Capitol shares
with the surrounding community the Capitol
Police is instructed to forebear enforcement
of 2 U.S.C. 1963 (‘‘an act to protect the public
property, turf, and grass of the Capitol
Grounds from injury’’) and the Traffic Regu-
lations for the United States Capitol
Grounds when encountering snow sledders on
the grounds.
GENERAL EXPENSES
The agreement includes $85,279,000 for gen-
eral expenses of the Capitol Police.
USCP Office of Inspector General: The agree-
ment provides funding not less than $452,500
for expenses of the Office of Inspector Gen-
eral.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION
The agreement amends 2 U.S.C. 1926(c), by
increasing the employee educational assist-
ance program reimbursement limit from
$40,000 to $60,000 for student loan repay-
ments.
OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL
WORKPLACE RIGHTS
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement includes $6,333,000 for sala-
ries and expenses.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement includes $54,941,000 for sala-
ries and expenses.
Responsiveness: The Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) is expected to ensure a high
level of responsiveness to committees, lead-
ership and Members, to the greatest extent
practicable under the priorities for CBO set
by law, especially when working on current
pending legislation. As an agency that prides
itself as being nonpartisan, CBO should be
providing the same information to all stake-
holders at the appropriate time when ad-
dressing legislation that has been made pub-
lic.
ARCHITECT OF THE CAPITOL
The agreement includes $695,933,000 for the
activities of the Architect of the Capitol
(AOC).
AOC Office of Inspector General (OIG): The
agreement includes not less than $3,810,000 to
support no fewer than 15 FTE within the
AOC OIG during fiscal year 2020.
AOC Response to Sexual Harassment Com-
plaints: There continues to be a concern with
the findings of the March 15, 2019, AOC OIG
review of the AOC’s response to sexual har-
assment complaints over the previous 10-
year period. Employees of the AOC should
feel their work environment is safe and that
complaints of harassment and discrimina-
tion are taken seriously.
The AOC is directed to report to the Com-
mittees within 60 days of enactment of this
act on the status of implementation for each
of the 16 inquiry results listed in the AOC
OIG’s report, to include the implementation
of the recommendations identified in prior
OIG sexual harassment management
advisories that went unimplemented in pre-
vious years. The report should detail the
timeline for implementation as well as any
updates or revisions to the AOC’s internal
policies relating to harassment and discrimi-
nation, including employee training on how
to prevent and properly report incidents.
Improved Coordination of Legislative Branch
Data Centers: Each legislative branch agency
independently determines how to manage its
data center needs, including: which type of
computing (center-based versus cloud-based)
to use, the appropriate location for its data
centers and required tier of security, the
type of facility business model (owned or
leased) and expected length of occupancy.
While it is appropriate for each agency to
make these decisions unilaterally, it does
create governance issues across the legisla-
tive branch. The AOC manages several facili-
ties that provide space for data centers, but
their use is subject to individual agency de-
cisions, making it difficult for AOC to plan
for building maintenance and renovations.
Coordination of agency decisions regarding
data centers would likely result in cost sav-
ings from economies of scale and agreements
on physical building space usage. The chief
information officers (CIOs) of the legislative
branch agencies are directed to form a gov-
ernance board that will have authority over
common elements among agencies’ manage-
ment of their data centers. Such elements
should include agreements on the use of
available space in data centers that are
owned and managed by the AOC. The board
should identify the expected rate of occu-
pancy of AOC data centers over the next 5 to
10 years, their required level of security, and
agreed-upon uses of unused space for other
purposes. The CIOs should report to the
Committees within 180 days of enactment of
this act that the governance board has been
created. Thereafter, the board should provide
annual reports to the Committees on its de-
liberations and decisions, with the first re-
port being due by January 30, 2021.
Data Provided for AOC Projects in Budget
Justifications: The AOC is requested to pro-
vide in its fiscal year 2022 budget justifica-
tion additional information about the line

Accessibility: It is critical for all individuals
visiting the U.S. Capitol complex to have the
opportunity to be inspired and learn. Individ-
uals with disabilities should receive the
same information and experiences as those
who do not have disabilities. Signage, bro-
chures and many exhibit descriptions are
available in Braille and/or large print. There
are several touchable models available as is
an audio descriptive tour of Exhibition Hall
in the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC). The ef-
forts of the Office of Congressional Accessi-
bility Services (OCAS) to develop a touch-
able model/map of the CVC and the Capitol
complex are helpful, as well as its develop-
ment of a descriptive audio tour for the rede-
signed Exhibition Hall located in the CVC. In
addition, its efforts to enhance independent
navigation and access to visual information
for those who are blind or have low vision
are important. However, emerging access
technologies, including remote video
connectivity to trained visual interpreters
that can support such access, should be con-
sidered. The AOC, working with the OCAS, is
encouraged to research and evaluate access
technologies for those who are blind or have
low vision that enable access to visual infor-
mation and enhance independent navigation.
The AOC is expected to provide a briefing to
the Committees within 180 days of enact-
ment of this act on plans to incorporate
these technologies into the visitor experi-
ence in the Capitol building.
Display of the Official Flags of Federally Rec-
ognized Indian Tribes: The AOC is encouraged
to study the feasibility of the display of the
official flags of federally recognized Indian
Tribes in visible spaces on the Capitol cam-
pus. The AOC is requested to provide a re-
port to the Committees within 120 days of
enactment of this act describing potential
scope and display method options.
Depictions of Native Americans and Native
American History in the Capitol: There are de-
pictions of Native Americans throughout the
Capitol complex that do not portray Native
Americans as equals or Indian Tribes as
independent sovereigns. The AOC is urged to
work with the Native American historians
and professionals at the National Museum of
the American Indian to ensure that the Cap-
itol complex describes more accurately and
respectfully represents the history of Native
Americans. The AOC is also encouraged to
acknowledge in its exhibitions on American
history and tradition the elements that have
originated from Native American cultures.
CAPITOL GROUNDS
The agreement includes $15,024,000 for the
care and improvements of the grounds sur-
rounding the Capitol, House and Senate of-
fice buildings, and the Capitol Power Plant,
of which $3,000,000 shall remain available
until September 30, 2024.
With respect to operations and projects,
the agreement includes the following:
Operating Budget: ................................................ $12,024,000
Project Budget:
Minor Construction ...................................... 3,000,000
3,000,000
Total, Capitol Grounds ....................... $15,024,000
Summerhouse: The historic Summerhouse
on the Capitol grounds designed in 1880 by
Frederick Law Olmsted is badly deteriorated
and has needed masonry structure renova-
tion for years. Yet, the project has been
deemed lower priority than other important
projects and not funded. The Architect is en-
couraged to apply to the United States Cap-
itol Preservation Commission for the
$3,200,000 requested in the fiscal year 2020
budget for renovation of the Summerhouse.
The Commission uses the Capitol Preserva-
tion Fund to provide financing for preserva-
tion of the Capitol and structures on Capitol
grounds, making the Summerhouse an ap-
propriate project recipient. The Architect is
requested to notify the Committees when a
request has been made to the Commission for
Summerhouse funding.
SENATE OFFICE BUILDINGS
The agreement includes $88,424,000 for the

Senate Employees’ Child Care Center
(SECCC): In anticipation of receipt by March
31, 2020, of the AOC report to identify and
evaluate potential options for expanding the
physical capacity of the SECCC, and a poten-
tial decision made on the path forward for
SECCC facility expansion, the agreement
concurs with the Senate Report and provides
an additional $1,000,000 for Senate Office
Buildings Minor Construction above the fis-
cal year 2020 budget request to be used for
pre-design activities if the selection of a pre-
ferred option from the ongoing study is final-
ized. Such pre-design activities would in-
clude developing a site-specific program of
requirements, an acquisition plan, and an
independent government estimate.

able from receipts credited as reimburse-
ments to this appropriation, the agreement
includes $98,957,000 for maintenance, care and
operation of the Capitol Power Plant, of
which $15,300,000 shall remain available until
September 30, 2024.
With respect to operations and projects,

ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION
The agreement prohibits payments of bo-
nuses to contractors behind schedule or over
budget.
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement includes $504,164,000 in di-
rect appropriations and authority to spend
receipts of $6,000,000 for a total of $510,164,000.
This amount includes $3,587,000 for the Vet-
erans History Project.
Office of Inspector General: The agreement
includes not less than $3,991,000 for the Li-
brary’s Office of Inspector General during
fiscal year 2020.
Centralized Funding for Information Tech-
nology: As requested by the Library, funding
for centralized IT services is appropriated di-
rectly to the main Library of Congress Sala-
ries and Expenses account for use by the Of-
fice of the Chief Information Officer instead
of to the component organizations receiving
the IT services. This realignment reflects
where services are actually being performed,
avoiding the need for repeated reimburse-
ment transactions, and will help facilitate
the final phases of IT centralization across
the Library. As a result, a total of $13,556,000
is provided to the Salaries and Expenses ac-
count, with $2,708,000 allocated for Copyright
Office IT services, $8,767,000 designated for
Congressional Research Service IT services,
and $2,081,000 allocated for National Library
Service for the Blind and Print Disabled IT
services. As a result of this realignment,
funding for the three agencies may appear
lower, compared to fiscal year 2019. The Li-
brary is expected to provide a detailed spend-
ing plan within 60 days of enactment of this
act, including any increase in FTE levels as-
sociated with the IT modernization.
Primary Computing Facility: Included within
this recommendation is $7,000,000 for Data
Center Transformation and Modernization
(phase II). The Library’s Office of the Chief
Information Officer has confirmed that it is
on schedule to complete the Data Center
Transformation Program by the end of fiscal
year 2020. The Librarian of Congress is di-
rected to provide a written report, within 30
days of enactment of this act, outlining a
month-by-month timeline of when the data
center migration will be completed, includ-
ing a detailed overview of how the Library
intends to meet its fiscal year 2020 deadline
to migrate to an offsite certified Tier III
data center.
IT Modernization and Integrated Master
Schedule: The agreement continues to build
on investments in IT modernization at the
Library, including updating outdated infra-
structure, supporting migration to a Tier III
data center, and improving the security of
the networks. To facilitate the oversight of
these investments, the Library is directed to
develop an integrated master schedule for its
overarching IT modernization efforts. The
integrated master schedule should use best
practice criteria from the Government Ac-
countability Office, Project Management In-
stitute, or other entity with similar exper-
tise to outline the span of the modernization
effort, to be updated on a rolling basis as
milestones are met and modernization moves
forward. In order to measure the moderniza-
tion cost and schedule performance on an on-
going basis, the integrated master schedule
should also include a comparison of the ap-
plicable planned cost of completed work to
actual cost incurred, to be updated quar-
terly. The baselined integrated master
schedule should be completed and shared
with the Committees within 60 days of enact-
ment of this act.
Visitor Experience Project: The agreement
provides $10,000,000 to be available until ex-
pended for further design and development of
the Visitor Experience Project. This brings
the total Federal investment provided thus
far for the project to $20,000,000. The Library
is expected to complete a detailed plan with
further design, along with cost estimates
completed by the Architect of the Capitol,
for the project. This material should be made
available as part of the Library’s annual
budget request. Language is included making
this funding available only upon approval of
the House and Senate Legislative Branch Ap-
propriations Subcommittees. Such approval
will be contingent upon agreement that the
Library has completed the necessary design
and development of the project, along with
detailed cost estimates. The Library is also
requested to provide semi-annually the
amount of non-Federal funding committed
or received for this project.
National Film and Sound Recording Preserva-
tion Programs: The important work of the Na-
tional Film Preservation Program and the
National Sound Recording Preservation Pro-
gram is recognized, including the federally
chartered National Film and National Re-
cording Preservation Foundations (Founda-
tions). Consistent with the authorizing stat-
ute, the Foundations utilize both public and
private matching funds to provide grants to
a wide array of educational and non-profit
organizations that help preserve historical
and cultural artifacts that would otherwise
disappear or be destroyed over time. Given
that these programs were reauthorized under
the Library of Congress Sound Recording
and Film Preservation Programs Reauthor-
ization Act of 2016 (Public Law 114–217), the
Library is expected to provide support to
these programs.
COPYRIGHT OFFICE
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement includes $42,137,000 in direct
appropriations to the Copyright Office. An
additional $45,700,000 is made available from
receipts for salaries and expenses and
$4,003,000 is available from prior year unobli-
gated balances, for a total of $91,840,000.
Information Technology Modernization: The
recommendation continues funding for Copy-
right Office IT modernization. The Copyright
Office is directed to provide a detailed spend
plan for the IT modernization efforts in-
tended to be addressed with the funds pro-
vided in fiscal year 2020. Additionally, the
Copyright Office is directed to develop an in-
tegrated and reliable master schedule for its
mission specific modernization efforts. The
integrated master schedule should use best
practice criteria from the Government Ac-
countability Office, Project Management In-
stitute, or other entity with similar exper-
tise to outline a set of detailed milestones
and outcome measures over the span of the
modernization effort, to be updated on a roll-
ing basis as milestones are met and mod-
ernization moves forward. In order to meas-
ure the modernization cost and schedule per-
formance on an ongoing basis, the integrated
master schedule should also include a com-
parison of the applicable planned cost of
completed work to actual cost incurred, to
be updated quarterly. The baselined inte-
grated master schedule should be completed
and shared with the Committees within 60
days of enactment of this act.
In lieu of language included in the Senate
report, the agreement includes the following:
Satellite Subsidy Expiration: There is a con-
cern that the distant signal provision con-
tained in the STELA Reauthorization Act of
2014 (Public Law 113–200) may provide a
below-market incentive for a mature sat-
ellite industry to restrict local news trans-
mission. Recognizing that this law is set to
expire on December 31, 2019, the Register of
Copyrights is directed to conduct a study on
the impact on the market post-expiration,
and report to the Committees within 18
months of enactment of this act.
CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement includes $120,495,000 for sal-
aries and expenses.
Congressional Staff Education: The Congres-
sional Research Service (CRS) provides valu-
able education seminars for congressional
staff on the legislative process. CRS is en-
couraged to continue to incorporate analyses
of Federal law and related judicial develop-
ments, legislation and the regulatory proc-
ess, and international law into its cur-
riculum.
NATIONAL LIBRARY SERVICE FOR THE BLIND
AND PRINT DISABLED
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement includes $58,563,000 for sala-

ber of users. The recommendation also in-
cludes $2,375,000 to increase the supply of
talking book machines and Braille eReaders.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION
The agreement includes a provision regard-
ing reimbursable and revolving funds.
GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE
CONGRESSIONAL PUBLISHING

The agreement includes $79,000,000 for au-
thorized publishing, printing and binding for
the Congress.
PUBLIC INFORMATION PROGRAMS OF THE

SALARIES AND EXPENSES
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The agreement includes $31,296,000.
GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE BUSINESS
OPERATIONS REVOLVING FUND
The agreement includes $6,704,000.
Office of Inspector General: The agreement
includes not less than $4,172,000 for the Gov-
ernment Publishing Office’s (GPO) Office of
Inspector General (OIG) during fiscal year
2020.
Responsiveness to Congress: The GPO OIG is
responsible for providing independent and
objective information to the Director of GPO
and to the Congress. The information pro-
vided is crucial to the oversight functions of
Congress and the daily functions of the agen-
cy and its employees. The OIG shall fully in-
form the Committees of any problems and
deficiencies within the agency, as provided
by statute. The OIG should inform the Com-
mittees periodically and upon request of all
completed activities of the OIG that are not
classified in nature. In instances when infor-
mation or reports are deemed agency-sen-
sitive, the OIG is expected to be transparent
and work collectively with the Committees
to ensure that Congress has access to infor-
mation critical to its legislative branch
oversight functions.
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement includes $630,000,000 in di-
rect appropriations for salaries and expenses
of the Government Accountability Office
(GAO). In addition, $24,800,000 is available
from offsetting collections, for a total of
$654,800,000.
GAO Office of Inspector General: The agree-
ment also includes not less than $2,375,000 for
the GAO Office of Inspector General, which
supports not less than 11 FTE.
Science and Technology Issues: The funding
provided will allow GAO to increase support
for Congress’ work on evolving science and
technology issues. The 2019 report from the
National Academy of Public Administration
(NAPA) identified the need for GAO to focus
its advice to Congress on technical assess-
ments and short-to-medium term studies.
The study also highlighted that although
GAO’s support requests from Congress have
increased, GAO should consider expanding
its outreach to the science and technology
community and coordination with CRS to
better fill these gaps. GAO is encouraged to
dedicate a specific number of experts to
work exclusively on GAO’s Science, Tech-
nology Assessment, and Analytics (STAA)
team that was created in January 2019, a rec-
ommendation that was included in the
NAPA report.
GAO Budget Appropriations Group: The GAO
Budget Appropriations Group provides im-
portant services to Congress through its for-
mal legal opinions, informal legal advice, the
updating of its three-volume treatise on ap-
propriations law, and its responsibilities
under the Impoundment Control Act. The
number of requests to the Budget Appropria-
tions Group has increased dramatically over
the last five years, making it more difficult
for GAO to respond to Congressional inquir-
ies. Within the increases provided, GAO is
encouraged to enhance the resources allo-
cated to its important appropriations law
functions.
OPEN WORLD LEADERSHIP CENTER TRUST FUND
The agreement includes $5,900,000.
Mission: The Open World Leadership Center
(OWLC) is applauded on its twentieth year of
operation. The highlight of OWLC’s accom-
plishments has been the engagement of pro-
gram participants with United States Gov-
ernment officials, including Members of Con-
gress, which helps to improve the image of
the United States in countries where leaders
have limited direct interface with Americans
and our values.
Open World should continue to support
Congress in fostering relationships with se-
lect foreign states in its programs as an ad-
junct to United States diplomatic relations,
and to gain greater understanding between
our nations. Such a course of action would
be in line with a national strategy to com-
pete for influence in Central and Eastern Eu-
rope as well as Central Asian countries,
given the current multi-polar world that pre-
sents both challenges and opportunities.
JOHN C. STENNIS CENTER FOR PUBLIC SERVICE
TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
The agreement includes $430,000.

The agreement continues provisions re-
lated to maintenance and care of private ve-
hicles; fiscal year limitations; rates of com-
pensation and designation; consulting serv-
ices; costs of the LBFMC; limitation on
transfers; guided tours of the Capitol; limita-
tion on telecommunications equipment pro-
curement; prohibition on certain operational

DIVISION F—MILITARY CONSTRUCTION,
VETERANS AFFAIRS, AND RELATED
AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2020
The following is an explanation of the ef-
fects of Division F which makes appropria-
tions for Military Construction, Veterans Af-
fairs, and Related Agencies for fiscal year
2020. Unless otherwise noted, references to
the House Report is reference to House Re-
port 116–63. The language set forth in House
Report 116–63 should be complied with and
carry the same emphasis as the language in-
cluded in the joint explanatory statement,
unless specifically addressed to the contrary
in this joint explanatory statement. While
repeating some report language for empha-
sis, this joint explanatory statement does
not intend to negate the language referred to
above unless expressly provided herein.
TITLE I
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
Reprogramming Guidelines.—The following
reprogramming guidelines apply for all mili-
tary construction and family housing
projects. A project or account (including the
sub-elements of an account) which has been
specifically reduced by the Congress in act-
ing on the budget request is considered to be
a congressional interest item and as such,
prior approval is required. Accordingly, no
reprogramming to an item specifically re-
duced below the threshold by the Congress is
permitted, except that the DOD may seek re-
programming for appropriated increments.
The reprogramming criteria that apply to
military construction projects, which is 25
percent of the funded amount or $2,000,000,
whichever is less, also apply to new housing
construction projects and improvements. To
provide the services the flexibility to pro-
ceed with construction contracts without
disruption or delay, the costs associated
with environmental hazard remediation such
as asbestos removal, radon abatement, lead-
based paint removal or abatement, and any
other legislated environmental hazard reme-
diation may be excluded, if such remediation
requirements could not be reasonably antici-
pated at the time of the budget submission.
This exclusion applies to projects authorized
in this budget year, as well as projects au-
thorized in prior years for which construc-
tion has not been completed.
In addition to these guidelines, the serv-
ices are directed to adhere to the guidance
for military construction reprogramming ac-
tions and notifications, including the perti-
nent statutory authorities contained in DOD
Financial Management Regulation 7000.14–R
and relevant updates and policy memoranda.
Further, the agreement encourages the Of-
fice of the Director of National Intelligence
to use a format similar to that used by the
Office of the Secretary of Defense to submit
reprogramming requests.
Natural Disasters and Military Installations
Resiliency.—The Committees support the
military’s continued focus on building last-
ing and resilient military installations, in-
cluding methods that update hurricane-re-
sistant building codes for bases, barracks,
hospitals, and airfields. The Committees
strongly support Department-wide initia-
tives such as revised structure planning, con-
servation programs and modeling new instal-
lations with the threat of sea-level rise in
mind. The agreement strongly urges DOD to
prioritize investing in climate-sustainable
infrastructure projects because they yield
positive results, such as increased resiliency
and cost-savings. The agreement reiterates
the direction provided in House Report 116–63
that directs DOD to detail its plans to fur-
ther develop lasting and resilient military
installations. The agreement also includes
$75,000,000 in planning and design funds for
the Services to address these and 10 U.S.C.
2864 master plan requirements in future mili-
tary construction programs.
Bid Savings.—Cost variation notices re-
quired by 10 U.S.C. 2853 continue to dem-
onstrate the Department of Defense (DOD)
continues to have bid savings on previously
appropriated military construction projects.
Therefore, the agreement includes rescis-
sions to the Defense-Wide military construc-
tion account and the NATO Security Invest-
ment Program. The Secretary of Defense is
directed to continue to submit 1002 reports
on military construction bid savings at the
end of each fiscal quarter to the Committees.
Incremental Funding.—In general, the Com-
mittees support full funding for military
construction projects if they are executable.
However, it continues to be the practice of
the Committees to provide incremental fund-
ing for certain large projects to enable the
services to more efficiently allocate military
construction dollars among projects that can
be executed in the year of appropriation.
Therefore, the agreement includes 16
projects that have been incrementally fund-
ed, however the full authorization of the
projects was provided in the National De-
fense Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2020.
Facilities Sustainment, Restoration and Mod-
ernization (FSRM).—The Department of De-
fense is directed to continue describing on
form 1390 the backlog of FSRM requirements
at installations with future construction
projects. For troop housing requests, form
1391 should describe any FSRM conducted in
the past two years. Likewise, future require-
ments for unaccompanied housing at the cor-
responding installation should be included.
Additionally, the forms should include
English equivalent measurements for
projects presented in metric measurement.
Rules for funding repairs of facilities under
the Operation and Maintenance accounts are
described below:
(1) components of the facility may be re-
paired by replacement. Such replacement
can be up to current standards or codes;
(2) interior arrangements and restorations
may be included as repair;
(3) additions and new facilities may be
done concurrently with repair projects, as
long as the final conjunctively funded
project is a complete and usable facility; and
(4) the appropriate service secretary shall
notify the appropriate committees 21 days
prior to carrying out any repair project with
an estimated cost in excess of $7,500,000.
Work In Progress Or Planned (WIP) Curve.—
The Services and the Office of the Secretary
of Defense (on behalf of itself and defense
agencies) are directed to submit a WIP curve
for each project requested in a budget sub-
mission above $90,000,000 with the 1391 jus-
tification to the congressional defense com-
mittees. Due to the alarming amount of
unawarded prior-year military construction
projects, the Secretary of Defense is directed
to report to the congressional defense com-
mittees quarterly, beginning in the second
quarter of fiscal year 2020 and each quarter
thereafter on projects that remain
unawarded from the current and prior fiscal
years and the reasons therefore. Finally, in
order to improve transparency and con-
sistent with data publication required under
10 U.S.C. 2851, the agreement directs the Sec-
retary of Defense to submit reports to the
congressional defense committees on a quar-
terly basis starting no later than the second
quarter of fiscal year 2020 identifying con-
tracts awarded in the relevant previous quar-
ter for projects funded in this title. At min-
imum the reports should include: the project
name and location, contract solicitation and
award date, and contract award amount.
Military Construction Thresholds.—The
agreement places no restriction on military
construction funding levels that can be re-
quested by the Department, whether domes-
tic or overseas although the Secretary of the
Army has issued guidance that the cost for
individual military construction projects
should not exceed $100,000,000. Project scopes
should not be artificially capped by cost and
the agreement directs the Army to reevalu-
ate this practice and to include incor-
porating area cost factor into any related
guidance. In accordance with standing prac-
tice, the Department is directed to request
such funds for military construction as may
be necessary to meet military requirements
and can be responsibly executed.
Leveraging Military Construction for Emer-
gent Requirements.—The Committees recog-
nize that other countries are utilizing infra-
structure to enhance national interest at a
higher rate of investment than the Depart-
ment of Defense. Military construction is
vital to current and future force readiness
and can be a strategic asset to deter near-
peer competitors, particularly in nations
that support U.S. posture in the Indo-Asia-
Pacific, such as Micronesia, the Marshall Is-
lands, and Palau. The agreement provides an
additional $10,000,000 in Defense-Wide plan-
ning and design for emergent requirements
in the Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM)
region that support National Defense Strat-
egy objectives to sustain joint force military
advantages and deter adversaries from ag-
gression against our national interest.
INDOPACOM is directed to provide a spend
plan for these funds no later than 180 days
after enactment of this Act.
Project Delivery and Process Improvements.—
Because of concern with the number of
projects delivered behind schedule or over
budget, the agreement directs the Secretary
of Defense to provide a report within 180
days of enactment of this Act on the Depart-
ment’s progress in adopting best industry
practices and other initiatives to address and
mitigate risks in the delivery of construc-
tion projects. The report should include de-
scriptions of the specific improvements that
have been assessed and the extent of their
implementation, the intended results and
metrics, suggested refinements to budget
documents, and individual assessments by
the Secretaries concerned and DOD construc-
tion agents on the extent to which they have
incorporated these improvements into their
military construction programs.
Construction Costs.—DOD faces increasing
challenges meeting its construction require-
ments in remote and highly remote markets
where projects are less competitive in the
DOD planning, programming, and budgeting
process compared to those in low costs mar-
kets, regardless of the importance of the
project to the DOD mission. Therefore, no
later than 270 days after enactment of this
Act, the US Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE) and Naval Facilities Command
(NAVFAC) are directed to provide a report
assessing strategies for controlling and re-
ducing costs to military construction
projects. The report shall specifically con-
sider project costs in remote and highly re-
mote markets, including overseas markets
in the Western and Southern Pacific. The re-
port shall also consider the costs that DOD
can control through the acquisition process,
including potential changes to procurement
authorities that allow preference of alter-
native, lower-cost building materials and
techniques, such as concrete curing, provided
the materials and techniques meet military
specific design standards.
Natural Disaster Recovery.—Consistent with
standard practice, the agreement directs
DOD to adhere to all applicable laws con-
cerning National Environmental Protection
Act (NEPA) requirements prior to beginning
any site preparation or construction. The
agreement further directs DOD no later than

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H11379
December 17, 2019
30 days after enactment of this Act to brief
the congressional defense committees on any
steps that have been taken or are expected
to be taken related to military construction
at installations recovering from natural dis-
asters that are not in accordance with NEPA
requirements.
Equivalent Standards.—The agreement en-
courages the Secretary of Defense, in coordi-
nation with the Secretaries of the Military
Departments, to pursue the identification of
equivalent host nation standards as an op-
tion to align U.S. and host country criteria
and standards to improve project delivery,
particularly in those countries where con-
struction costs are escalating. Furthermore,
the agreement encourages DOD construction
agents and project sponsors to utilize equiva-
lent standards as appropriate on DOD
projects to the maximum extent possible.
Federal, State and Local Intelligence Collabo-
ration.—Several states utilize National
Guard Bureau (NGB) facilities for intel-
ligence analysis and fusion centers. As pre-
viously indicated in Senate Report 115–130
and Senate Report 115–269, the Committees
remain supportive of such collaborative co-
location projects particularly as it relates to
the NGB’s Joint Force Headquarters Anal-
ysis Cells concept. The Committees urge the
Department and the NGB to prioritize need-
ed workplace replacement projects, includ-
ing Sensitive Compartmented Information
Facility projects to conduct State and Fed-
eral intelligence analysis, in the fiscal year
2021 and future budget submissions.
Child Development Centers (CDCs) and Qual-
ity of Life (QOL).—Adequate childcare is vi-
tally important to servicemembers and their
families, and the lack of Child Development
Centers (CDCs) creates an unnecessary hard-
ship for them. To address this shortfall, the
agreement includes $11,000,000 in each of the
Services’ planning and design accounts to as-
sist them in preparing for the construction
of new CDCs at the most underserved mili-
tary installations. In addition, the Commit-
tees expect the direction given in House Re-
port 116–63 to be followed.
Defense Access Roads.—Improving road safe-
ty at and around military facilities is an im-
portant part of maintaining and enhancing
military readiness, and there is a concern
that DOD’s lack of future planning for De-
fense Access Roads (DAR) and transpor-
tation infrastructure needs around bases
places servicemembers and their families at
risk especially at Reserve bases. The agree-
ment directs the Secretary of Defense in con-
sultation with the Secretary of Transpor-
tation to prioritize all DAR certified roads
and projects in the outyears 2021–2026. The
agreement directs the Secretary of Defense
to provide a list of planned DAR projects at
active and reserve installations no later than
60 days after the enactment of this Act.
MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, ARMY
The agreement provides $1,178,499,000 for
‘‘Military Construction, Army’’, which is
$275,000,000 below the budget request. Within
this amount, the agreement provides
$136,099,000 for study, planning, design, archi-
tect and engineer services, and host nation
support. The agreement also provides an ad-
ditional $11,000,000 above the request for
planning and design for child development
centers.
Motorpools.— The Committees look forward
to receiving the report requested in House
Report 116–63 regarding the modernization
needs of motorpools that support the rapid
deployment of armored combat units.
Alaska Infrastructure Readiness Initiative.—
The agreement recognizes that U.S. Army
Pacific senior leaders proposed an Alaska In-
frastructure Readiness Initiative to address
identified deficiencies in infrastructure in
Alaska and encourages the Army to pursue
this initiative and provide biannual reports
to the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress on its progress.
Range Expansion.—Recognizing the concern
that the Army lacks adequate testing and
range space to test new, increased range and
capacity fires, and that it is currently in dis-
cussions with Yuma Proving Grounds to pro-
vide additional capability for testing, the
agreement encourages the Army to continue
this planning and propose necessary re-
sources in future budgets to support this ex-
pansion.
MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, NAVY AND MARINE
CORPS
The agreement provides $2,449,632,000 for
‘‘Military Construction, Navy and Marine
Corps’’, which is $356,111,000 below the budget
request. Within this amount, the agreement
provides $178,715,000 for study, planning, de-
sign, architect and engineer services. The
agreement also provides an additional
$11,000,000 above the request for planning and
design for child development centers.
Fire and Emergency Services.—There is con-
tinued concern about the current state of
fire and emergency services facilities at in-
stallations across the country. Installations
such as Naval Support Activity Bethesda op-
erate fire stations built more than 70 years
ago and are unable to be modified to accom-
modate modern vehicles and fire trucks or
provide the appropriate livable quarters.
Many of the stations lack the appropriate
fire suppression systems therefore rendering
them unusable. The Department of the Navy
is directed to plan and program sufficient
funding to address fire and emergency serv-
ices shortfalls in its fiscal year 2021–2025 fu-
ture years defense program.
Navy Pier Replacement Master Plan.—To ad-
dress concerns that the Navy has not prop-
erly synchronized or prioritized pier replace-
ment projects the agreement directs the Sec-
retary of the Navy to provide to the congres-
sional defense committees a report no later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act on
pier replacement projects in the fiscal years
defense plan for 2021–2025.
Naval Shipyard Modernization.—The agree-
ment supports the Department’s Shipyard
Infrastructure Optimization Plan (SIOP)
submitted to Congress in February 2018. The
Committees continue to believe the Navy’s
assessment of public shipyard dry dock ca-
pacity is particularly important, as it identi-
fies 68 deferred maintenance availabilities
under the status quo, 67 of which are re-
stored upon making the public shipyard dry
dock investments within the timeframe rec-
ommended by the plan. Accordingly, the
Secretary of the Navy is urged to prioritize
the timely funding of public shipyard infra-
structure, and in particular dry dock and
shore infrastructure necessary to support
critical maintenance of surface and sub-
marine fleets by public shipyards.
The SIOP also includes ongoing feasibility
assessments on new concepts to improve
shipyard maintenance efficiency. The Com-
mittees expect the Navy to continue to as-
sess these new concepts without delaying
construction improvements at the public
shipyards for which Congress has already ap-
propriated funding. As such, the Committees
are disappointed that the Navy cancelled for
a second time a project requested and appro-
priated for that would construct a dry dock
waterfront facility (P214) prior to providing
a realistic plan to address urgent safety
issues and meet Pacific Fleet maintenance
requirements. The agreement directs the
Secretary of the Navy to develop a cost esti-
mate for its dry dock production facility
(DDPF) concept, and to provide a report
within 90 days of enactment of this Act on
the feasibility of programming and con-
structing the lead DDPF at Pearl Harbor
Naval Shipyard as a replacement for P214.
The agreement also directs the Secretary of
the Navy to include in such report the
planned sustainment, restoration, and mod-
ernization measures that will be undertaken
to mitigate the effect of a further delayed re-
placement facility.
New Platforms and Weapons Systems.—There
is concern that the Department of the
Navy’s process to identify, plan, and budget
for requirements to provide adequate shore
facilities and infrastructure to support the
deployment of new weapons systems is
flawed and that projects requested by the
Department do not include all facility and
infrastructure requirements needed to sup-
port the weapons systems, leading to the
need to alter the scope of the project or re-
program already scarce funds. Therefore, the
agreement directs the Secretary of the Navy
to provide a report within 180 days of enact-
ment of this Act on the Department’s proc-
esses and timelines for identifying the full
range of infrastructure and range require-
ments associated with the life cycle support
for major weapons systems, prior to the pro-
gramming of those systems for procurement.
Specifically, the report should address (1)
the Department’s processes and timelines as-
sociated with incorporating those require-
ments into the program of record, periodic
reviews, and ultimately into annual budget
submissions; (2) the review and evaluation of
the risk associated with not funding certain
requirements, to include the assessment of
the costs of workarounds; (3) how, when, and
to what extent organizations in the Depart-
ment responsible for the management of fa-
cilities and shore infrastructure are incor-
porated into the process of identifying re-
quirements and developing budget input
prior to the fielding of new equipment; (4)
the process to ensure that budget justifica-
tion and periodic program reviews include
work needed to provide adequate infrastruc-
ture, utilities, and other systems needed to
support the weapons systems; and (5) any im-
pediments in law or policy that impact the
Department’s ability to make decisions
about infrastructure investments associated
with major weapons system procurements.
MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, AIR FORCE
The agreement provides $1,687,230,000 for
‘‘Military Construction, Air Force’’, which is
$492,000,000 below the budget request. Within
this amount, the agreement provides
$153,148,000 for study, planning, design, archi-
tect and engineer services. The agreement
also provides an additional $11,000,000 above
the request for planning and design for child
development centers.
Defense Laboratory Modernization Pilot Pro-
gram.—The agreement includes an additional
$111,000,000 to support three Air Force lab-
oratories located at Edwards AFB, Eglin
AFB and Nellis AFB.
Air Force Ballistic Missile Facilities.—There
is concern about the Air Force’s decision to
defer missile alert facility (MAF) recapital-
ization until a Ground Based Strategic De-
terrent (GBSD) design solution has matured.
While it is not responsible to construct fa-
cilities that could soon be obsolete, the Air
Force should more thoroughly examine
whether recapitalization of MAFs is wholly
incompatible with future GBSD design. The
agreement urges the Air Force to invest suf-
ficiently in the human component of the leg-
acy weapons system and ensure adequate
funding for MAF sustainment, and recapital-
ization, as necessary.
The agreement also recognizes the impor-
tance of the Weapons Generation Facility
(WGF) modernization program but remains
concerned about execution delays, cost over-
runs, and the impact to follow on projects,
VerDate Sep 11 2014 23:32 Dec 22, 2019 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00319 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A17DE7.059 H17DEPT3

which may experience similar challenges.
The agreement encourages the Air Force to
continue to follow its revised plan for con-
struction and upgrades to the WGF enter-
prise and to provide quarterly briefings to
update the Committees on status, require-
ments changes, and timelines for current and
future projects associated with the WGF
modernization program.
Corrosion Control and Painting Facilities.—
There is concern that the Air Force may not
have adequate corrosion control and paint-
ing facilities to support the RQ–4 aircraft.
For example, at Grand Forks Air Force Base,
aircraft painting is contracted out due to a
lack of facilities that can support these ca-
pabilities. Therefore, the agreement directs
the Secretary of the Air Force to report
within 90 days of enactment of this Act on
its capacity to perform corrosion control and
painting activities for the RQ–4 aircraft, the
outstanding infrastructure requirements
needed to support these efforts, and whether
these requirements can be met with facility
sustainment, restoration, and modernization
funding or military construction.
MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, DEFENSE-WIDE
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The agreement provides $2,362,529,000 for
‘‘Military Construction, Defense-Wide’’,
which is $141,661,000 below the budget re-
quest. Within this amount, the agreement
provides $298,655,000 for study, planning, de-
sign, architect and engineer services.
Energy Resilience and Conservation Invest-
ment Program (ERCIP).—The agreement pro-
vides $232,630,000 for ERCIP, an increase of
$82,630,000 above the budget request to fund
seven unfunded requirements of the program
for energy resilience. Also, an additional
$13,300,000 is provided under the Defense-
Wide planning and design account specifi-
cally for ERCIP. The Secretary of Defense is
directed to submit to the congressional de-
fense committees a spend plan for the addi-
tional ERCIP funds, to include the planning
and design funds, no later than 30 days after
enactment of this Act.
Renewable Energy Systems, Energy Conserva-
tion, and Energy Policy.—The agreement sup-
ports the Department’s efforts to improve
energy resilience, improve mission assur-
ance, save energy, and reduce energy costs.
DOD must continue to increase the integra-
tion of alternative energy sources, particu-
larly through renewable sources at all mili-
tary facilities and installations. The Com-
mittees expect DOD to follow all directives
provided in House Report 116–63 regarding
Renewable Energy Systems, Energy Con-
servation, and Energy Policy.
Fuel Storage Assurance.—The agreement
recognizes the important role that assured
access to adequate fuel has on the Joint
Force’s readiness and the challenges the De-
fense Logistics Agency will face funding fuel
storage requirements from within its exist-
ing military construction account that ac-
commodate future force structure and pos-
ture requirements, environmental regula-
tions, and other changes affecting the Joint
Force’s fuel needs. No later than 180 days
after enactment of this Act, the agreement
directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a
report assessing the feasibility of meeting
future fuel storage infrastructure require-
ments in DOD’s planning, programming, and
budgeting process, using a Joint Force fund-
ing construct.
MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, ARMY NATIONAL
GUARD
The agreement provides $210,819,000 for
‘‘Military Construction, Army National
Guard’’, which is the same as the budget re-
quest. Within this amount, the agreement
provides $20,469,000 for study, planning, de-
sign, architect and engineer services.
Readiness Center Transformation Master
Plan.—The Army National Guard (ARNG)
should continue to dedicate funding to im-
plement the Readiness Center Trans-
formation Master Plan. The Committees
urge the Army and ARNG leadership to suffi-
ciently budget for military construction so
that sustained investment in Readiness Cen-
ter transformation does not result in se-
verely neglected operational facilities across
the remaining infrastructure enterprise.
Regional Training Institutes.—The Commit-
tees recognize the importance of Regional
Training Institutes (RTI) across the country
for the readiness of ARNG and are concerned
about the lack of infrastructure to support
the mission of the RTIs. For example, the
RTI at Fort Hood is lacking sufficient facili-
ties to provide the proper training to achieve
optimum readiness. The Committees urge
the Department of Defense to prioritize fa-
cilities for this important and vital mission
of ARNG and Army Reserve.
National Guard Training Center.—The Com-
mittees recognize the importance of the Na-
tional Guard Texas Training Center, which
has been in development since 2010 and has
had execution delays. The Committees rec-
ognize that the Texas Training Center re-
mains a high priority and the Texas Army
National Guard shall continue its efforts to
establish the Center. The agreement directs
the Director of the Army National Guard to
provide a progress report to the congres-
sional defense committees no later than 90
days after enactment of this Act.’’
MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, AIR NATIONAL
GUARD
The agreement provides $164,471,000 for
‘‘Military Construction, Air National
Guard’’, which is $1,500,000 below the budget
request. Within this amount, the agreement
provides $17,000,000 for study, planning, de-
sign, architect and engineer services.
MQ–9 Facilities.—Some Air National Guard
MQ–9 units will require new operations fa-
cilities in the coming years to be able to con-
tinue executing the MQ–9 mission. The Na-
tional Guard Bureau should continue to
prioritize funding for necessary construction
projects in future budget requests to avoid
unnecessary risk to MQ–9 operations.
MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, ARMY RESERVE
The agreement provides $60,928,000 for
‘‘Military Construction, Army Reserve’’,
which is the same as the budget request.
Within this amount, the agreement provides

FAMILY HOUSING
ITEMS OF INTEREST
Housing Support and Management Costs.—
The agreement also includes section 131
under Administrative Provisions that pro-
vides an additional $140,800,000 above the
budget request for Family Housing Support
and Management Costs to increase the Serv-
ices’ ability to provide oversight and man-
agement, and personnel to track current and
future issues that may affect military family
housing. The additional funds were identified
by the Services on the Unfunded Priority list
submitted to Congress by the Service Secre-
taries.
Military Privatized Housing.—Quality mili-
tary housing is a key component of military
readiness and quality of life, and the health
of our servicemembers and their families is
of the utmost importance. Substandard liv-
ing conditions negatively affect the ability
to recruit and retain servicemembers to the
detriment of U.S. national security inter-
ests. Among other things, House Report 116–
63 directed the Services to establish and
maintain procedures for ensuring appro-
priate response and remediation efforts to
safety and health threats in military hous-
ing managed by private sector property man-
agement companies. DOD is expected to
comply with all the directives included in
House Report 116–63.

TITLE II
DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
ITEMS OF SPECIAL INTEREST
Notification of Allegations.—Reports of al-
leged negligence or criminal behavior by VA
providers that may have resulted in serious
health outcomes raise extreme concerns. In
multiple cases, there were warning signs of
reckless or illegal behavior that were not re-
ported or acted upon in a timely manner and
may have resulted in the death of multiple
veterans. Therefore, the bill maintains a pro-
vision requiring the Department to develop a
plan to reduce the chances that clinical mis-
takes by VA employees will result in adverse
events that require institutional or clinical
disclosures, as VA has not adequately ad-
dressed the requirement. The agreement di-
rects the Secretary to develop processes and
procedures for staff of medical facilities to
report concerns to Veterans Integrated Serv-
ice Network (VISN) and Departmental lead-
ers for awareness and action, as well as pro-
cedures for expediting any remedial or fol-
low-up care, an impact analysis, and a com-
munication and education plan for making
staff aware of the appropriate protocols. The
agreement further directs the Department to
report on this effort, as well as VA’s recent
commitment to retrain all Veterans Health
Administration leadership and personnel, to
the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress within 30 days of enact-
ment of this Act.
Blue Water Navy Veterans.—The agreement
includes funds to address the personnel, sup-
port and Information Technology costs re-
quired to implement the Blue Water Navy
Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019 (Public Law
116–23) by January 1, 2020. Although the ad-
ministration refused to submit a formal re-
quest for these funds, the Committees appre-
ciate VA’s efforts to prepare for this increase
in complex cases and to prevent increases in
the disability claims backlog.
Transition from Active Duty to Civilian
Life.—The Department is encouraged, in con-
sultation with the Departments of Defense
and Labor, to partner with community-built
networks and non-profit programs, including
faith-based programs, that provide wrap-
around employment and counseling services
to veterans and their families, including
high-risk veterans, to ensure they have a
successful transition to civilian life.
Contract Oversight.—The Department’s lack
of transparency in the contracting process,
including reported incidents of willful mis-
representation of veteran or service-disabled
veteran status for the purposes of winning
Federal contract set-asides, remains a con-
cern. The agreement directs the Department,
in consultation with relevant agency part-
ners, to provide any regulatory or legislative
actions that would serve as further disincen-
tives to this fraudulent behavior. Due to con-
cern over the lack of visibility into con-
tractor performance, the agreement requires
the Department to submit to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations and Veterans’ Affairs
of both Houses of Congress notification
whenever the Secretary provides notice to a
contracted service provider that the service
provider is failing to meet contractual obli-
gations. At a minimum, the notification
should include: (1) an explanation of the rea-
sons for providing such notice; (2) a descrip-
tion of the effect of such failure, including
with respect to cost, schedule, and require-
ments; (3) a description of the actions taken
by the Secretary to mitigate such failure;
and, (4) a description of the actions taken by
the contractor to address such failure.
Use of Authority to Convert Non-Medical
Services to Contract Performance by Native Ha-
waiian Organizations or Indian Tribes.—Sec-
tion 238 of the Energy and Water, Legislative
Branch, and Military Construction and Vet-
erans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019 (Pub-
lic Law 115–244) maintained VA’s authority
to convert activities or functions of VBA,
VHA, and NCA to contractor performance by
businesses that are at least 51 percent owned
by one or more Indian tribes as defined in
section 5304(e) of title 25, United States Code,
or one or more Native Hawaiian Organiza-
tions as defined in section 637(a)(15) of title
15, United States Code. The agreement di-
rects the Department to submit a report to
the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress no later than 180 days
after enactment of this Act detailing VA’s
use of this authority to date and its plan for
using it in the future.
Discontinued Use of Social Security Num-
bers.—Section 239 of Public Law 115–244 re-
quired the Department to discontinue using
Social Security account numbers to identify
individuals in all information systems of the
Department within 5 years for new claims
and 8 years for all others. To date, the De-
partment has not yet provided Congress with
any information regarding its plan to imple-
ment this statutory requirement. The agree-
ment directs the Department to report to
the Committees on Appropriations and Vet-
erans’ Affairs of both Houses of Congress
within 120 days of enactment of this Act a
detailed timeline for implementation of this
requirement and any budgetary require-
ments needed to carry it out.
Security Risk Management.—Providing wel-
coming access to Department facilities while
maintaining the necessary security is chal-
lenging. However, the Committees are con-
cerned that the Department’s current risk
management policies and police governance
processes are not sufficient to ensure med-
ical facilities are adequately protected. The
Department is urged to quickly implement
the recommendations in the Office of Inspec-
tor General (OIG) report entitled, ‘‘Inad-
equate Governance of the VA Police Pro-
gram at Medical Facilities.’’
Debt Recoupment.—The Department has not
yet developed a way to track debt incurred
by an individual veteran, and how much of
that debt is a result of processing delays or
errors by VA. The agreement requires the
Department to submit to the Committees on
Appropriations of both Houses of Congress
within 120 days of enactment of this Act a
plan and timeline for tracking the cause of a
debt incurred by a veteran. Further, the De-
partment should consider that debt assigned
to a veteran due to a delay or mistake in
processing by VA or a VA employee is con-
sidered by the Committees, for purposes of
tracking, to be an error by the Department.
Unobligated Balances of Expired Discre-
tionary Funds.—The agreement directs the
Secretary to submit to the Committees on
Appropriations of both Houses of Congress a
report no later than April 15, 2020, and quar-
terly thereafter, detailing all unobligated
balances of expired discretionary funds by
fiscal year.

fits Administration (VBA) and Information
Technology Systems for reimbursement of
necessary expenses in implementing provi-
sions of title 38. The agreement also provides

addition to the advance appropriation pro-
vided last year.

be necessary for costs associated with direct
and guaranteed loans for the Veterans Hous-
ing Benefit Program Fund. The agreement

tive expenses.

General Operating Expenses, Veterans Bene-
fits Administration and, of the amount pro-
vided, not to exceed 10 percent is available

The agreement provides $125,000,000 above
the request to hire additional claims and ap-
pellate staff and to meet the requirements to
implement the Blue Water Navy Vietnam
Veterans Act. The agreement requires VA to
report to the Committees on Appropriations
of both Houses of Congress on a quarterly
basis information related to claims consid-
ered under the Blue Water Navy Vietnam
Veterans Act. This information should in-
clude timeliness measures as well as grant
and denial rates for these claims. The agree-
ment requires the Department to provide
monthly updates on performance measures
for each Regional Office.
Veterans Transportation Program.—The
agreement recognizes the importance of the
Veterans Transportation Program and the
role it plays in improving access to care by
assisting Veterans in overcoming transpor-
tation barriers when accessing VHA services.
Equitable Relief.—As described in House Re-
port 116–63, the Secretary is directed to con-
tinue to grant or extend equitable relief to
eligible veterans initially deemed eligible in
instances of administrative error.
Education Benefits.—The Committees are
concerned about the levels of overpayments
and improper payments being paid to GI Bill
beneficiaries. The agreement directs VA to
work with education stakeholders to ensure
that veteran educational benefits are paid in
a timely and accurate manner, and that ef-
forts to recoup any overpayments or im-
proper payments are fair and not overly bur-
densome on student veterans and their fami-
lies. The agreement further directs VA, in
collaboration with the Departments of De-
fense and Education, to provide an inter-
agency report on the development and con-
tinued implementation of the Principles of
Excellence, oversight of institutions com-
plying with the Principles, and appropriate

and timely accountability measures for edu-
cational programs receiving Federal funding.
Lastly, the agreement directs the Depart-
ment to continue to reform the compliance
survey process to allow early detection of
fraudulent marketing or predatory recruit-
ing practices among institutions of higher
learning, and to codify a set of tools that is
sufficiently agile enough to curtail the be-
havior of scamming institutions.
Education Data Collection and Sharing.—The
Committees believe that both students and
VA should be able to make more evidence-
based decisions when it comes to veterans’
education. The agreement directs the De-
partment to work with the Departments of
Education and Defense to ensure that there
is a comprehensive database, or at a min-
imum, a set of data-sharing agreements in
place between Federal entities involved in
the administration of Federal resources re-
lated to veteran educational attainment.
The agreement further directs the Depart-
ment to provide an interagency report on the
development and implementation of data-
sharing agreements, and the uses and effec-
tiveness of the data shared. The report must
be completed and provided to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress no later than 270 days after enact-
ment of this Act.
Gulf War Veterans Claims for Service-Con-
nected Disability Compensation.—The Depart-
ment’s high rates of denial of Gulf War vet-
erans’ claims for undiagnosed illnesses and
chronic multi-symptom illnesses continue to
be concerning. The agreement directs the
Department to continue to seek ways to im-
prove the grant rate for disability claims and
to better address the needs of those veterans
suffering with undiagnosed illnesses and
chronic multi-symptom illnesses after their
Gulf War service.
Medical Disability Exams.—Consistent with
statute, the agreement directs the Depart-
ment to ensure that any non-VA physician
contracted to conduct medical disability ex-
aminations must have a current unrestricted
license to practice as a physician, and is not
barred from practicing in any State, the Dis-
trict of Columbia, or a Commonwealth, Ter-
ritory, or possession of the United States.
Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment
Service Counselor to Client Ratio.—The signifi-
cant understaffing within rehabilitation pro-
grams negatively impacts veterans with a
service-connected disability using these pro-
grams. The agreement encourages the De-
partment to seek opportunities to expand
staffing counselors in these critical areas in
order to reach the ratio of 125 veterans to
one full-time equivalent (FTE) position, and
to provide the comprehensive individualized
services that these veterans have earned.
VetSuccess on Campus.—The agreement
strongly encourages VA to continue to sup-
port the VetSuccess on Campus program and
expand to additional schools.
Anti-Recidivism Programs.—The agreement
encourages VA to look for opportunities to
partner with non-profit organizations that
provide programs for incarcerated veterans
to reduce the likelihood of recidivism. VA
should consider partnering with organiza-
tions that provide combined services to vet-
erans to support their transition out of in-
carceration to being productive members of
the communities to which they return. As
VA pursues these partnerships, the agree-
ment encourages the establishment of
metrics to measure the partnerships’ effec-
tiveness, including reduced recidivism rates
among veterans.
GI Bill Apprenticeships and On-the-Job-
Training.—Apprenticeships and on-the-job
training (OJT) programs are important tools
in teaching veterans valuable skills and aid-
ing veterans in securing employment after
transitioning from military service. How-
ever, these programs are largely underuti-
lized by veterans. The agreement directs VA
to provide a briefing to the Committees on
Appropriations of both Houses of Congress
no later than 90 days after enactment of this
Act to update the Committees on the De-
partment’s efforts to promote awareness and
increased utilization of apprenticeships and
OJT, including VA’s plans for tracking data
on program outcomes, such as employment
and income information, as well as informa-
tion concerning any funding needs or nec-
essary legislative changes to ensure these
programs’ success.
VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION
Importance of In-House VA Care.—As VA
continues to implement the John S. McCain
III, Daniel K. Akaka, and Samuel R. Johnson
VA Maintaining Internal Systems and
Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks
(MISSION) Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–182),
the Committees recognize the vital role of
VA’s healthcare facilities in serving the
unique needs of veterans. VA’s medical cen-
ters, community-based outpatient centers,
and other facilities provide veterans with
necessary services — such as audiology, pros-
thetics, mental health services for post-trau-
matic stress disorder and traumatic brain in-
jury, and rehabilitation services for spinal
cord injuries—that are highly specialized and
at which VA often has more expertise than
community providers. Veterans overwhelm-
ingly report they are satisfied with the care
they receive at VA healthcare facilities. Re-
search has also consistently shown that VA
produces as good, if not better, health out-
comes as the private sector. In addition, VA
healthcare facilities play a critical role in
our Nation’s health system in training new
doctors, nurses, and other medical providers;
conducting lifesaving medical research; pro-
viding nationwide emergency preparedness
support; and innovating many best practices
in healthcare delivery. The Committees,
therefore, stress the importance of VA con-
tinuing to fully fund, fully staff, and appro-
priately maintain its healthcare facilities,
even as the VA MISSION Act is imple-
mented. The agreement requires VA to con-
tinue to enhance the services provided in its
facilities to ensure that VA healthcare con-
tinues to be of the quality and effectiveness
that veterans have come to expect.
VA MISSION Act.—The agreement provides
$8,908,585,000 in fiscal year 2020 and
$11,291,827,000 in fiscal year 2021, consistent
with the budget request, to implement the
VA MISSION Act. The agreement fully funds
the Department’s request in order to provide
greater access to timely and quality care for
veterans, both in VA and in the community,
but is interested in closely monitoring the fi-
nancial impact of the access standards.
The agreement directs the Department to
submit quarterly reports to the Committees
on: (1) the number of veterans served by each
authority for care outlined in section 1703(d)
of title 38, United States Code (i.e., the De-
partment does not offer the care, the Depart-
ment does not operate a full-service medical
facility in the State in which the covered
veteran resides, etc.); (2) the cost of such
care broken out by the authorities in section
1703(d); and (3) the timeliness of care, on av-
erage. In addition, the agreement directs the
Department to submit monthly reports to
the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress identifying available re-
sources, obligations, authorizations, and an-
ticipated funding needs. These monthly re-
ports should include the Veterans Choice
Fund balances and clearly show funds from
the Veterans Choice Fund used to support
new non-VA care authorizations since June
6, 2019. The reports should also include detail
on the timing of authorization of care and
the obligation of funds.
Allocations.—The Committees remind the
Department, in accordance with the Joint
Explanatory Statement accompanying Pub-
lic Law 115–244, that it was directed to con-
sult with the Committees on Appropriations
and Veterans Affairs of both Houses of Con-
gress before any future attempts are made to
realign Specific Purpose funding to General
Purpose funding, and that such future re-
alignments must be proposed in an annual
budget submission. No such consultation oc-
curred, and the fiscal year 2020 budget sub-
mission did not reflect any conversion of
funding. Therefore, the agreement directs
that the Department not convert any Special
Purpose funding to General Purpose funding
in fiscal year 2020.
Joint National Intrepid Spirit Center.—The
agreement directs the VA/DOD Health Exec-
utive Committee to provide a report to the
Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress no later than 60 days
after enactment of this Act on the Depart-
ments’ collaborative efforts related to trau-
matic brain injury (TBI) care, research and
education to improve the quality of and ac-
cess to TBI care, and the pros and cons of es-
tablishing a joint DOD/VA Intrepid Spirit
Center that serves both the active duty and
veteran populations for the mutual benefit
and growth in treatment and care. The re-
port should include an analysis of how better
to serve servicemembers and veterans with
TBI in areas with limited access to TBI care
(i.e., rural areas), including the establish-
ment of a joint DOD/VA Intrepid Spirit Cen-
ter in such an area. The report must include
an analysis of existing DOD medical facili-
ties that partner with VA, existing warrior
transition units or similar units that support
active duty servicemembers who require
comprehensive care, and academic institu-
tions specializing in Polytrauma/TBI in geo-
graphic locations without an existing Na-
tional Intrepid Center of Excellence or In-
trepid Spirit Center. In addition, the report
should propose metrics that demonstrate
short-term as well as long-term (i.e., 6 to 24
months) program effectiveness, including
sustainability of patient independence by ge-
ographic area, a plan to collect longitudinal
data to analyze longer-term effects, and the
financial requirements to establish and
maintain such a Center.
Prompt Payment.—The Committees remain
committed to supporting VA’s efforts to en-
sure timely reimbursement for non-VA
healthcare providers and facilities that pro-
vide necessary care for our veterans. The
agreement encourages the Department to
provide strong oversight and improve timely
payment to non-VA providers. The agree-
ment also urges VA to facilitate the comple-
tion of all outstanding reimbursements as
promptly as possible.
Public-Private Partnerships.—The Depart-
ment’s research investment could be ex-
panded to leverage non-Federal initiatives
that provide the opportunity for strong co-
location of VA and university biomedical
scientists for translational investigation,
which has high potential for precision medi-
cine outcomes for wounded warriors and
other high-risk veteran populations. The
agreement notes the high concentration of
VA research enterprises on the Nation’s two
coasts and urges the Under Secretary for
Health to expedite consideration of proposals
for the Department to lease space from re-
search complexes where there is multi-dis-
ciplinary investigation related to veterans
and wounded warriors, including medicine,
engineering and veterinary science. Such
consideration should be timely to inform ac-
tion in the fiscal year 2021 budget.

mittees believe that having access to WiFi

and the internet at VA medical facilities is
important, and while many VA facilities pro-
vide internet access in certain specific loca-
tions, access is not provided to inpatient
treatment rooms or waiting areas across the
campus. The agreement directs the Depart-
ment to assess internet coverage for vet-
erans and guests across facilities, and to re-
port on the current status of internet access,
the cost estimates for expanding internet
coverage to all appropriate locations at VA
facilities, and the infrastructure and cyber
security requirements to support such ex-
pansion. The report must be provided to the
Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress within 180 days of enact-
ment of this Act.
Veterans Health Administration Staffing
Model.—It is critical that VHA develop a
staffing model to better understand and
more quickly address staffing needs across
the organization, particularly in critical
need occupations. The agreement directs OIG
to review VHA’s progress in developing a
comprehensive staffing model and timeline
for implementation. The agreement further
directs OIG to meet with the Committees
within 30 days of enactment of this Act to
discuss details of the planned study.
Emergency Room Claims.—The United
States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims
decided in Wolfe v. Wilkie that VA was re-
sponsible for reimbursing veterans inappro-
priately denied payment for emergency care
obtained outside of the VA system. The
agreement directs the Department to under-
take a review of post-April 8, 2016, rejected
and denied emergency care claims, and to ex-
plore the feasibility of reviewing claims re-
jected or denied prior to that date. Further,
the agreement directs the Department to ex-
amine what it can do to mitigate the finan-
cial damage done to those veterans whose
unpaid emergency care claims were sent to a
collection agency and now have damaged
credit. Finally, the agreement directs the
Department to provide a detailed plan for
how it will re-adjudicate inappropriately de-
nied post-April 8, 2016 claims; describe
whether and how it will review claims denied
or rejected before that date; provide an anal-
ysis of how it came to that conclusion; and
describe steps it will take to mitigate dam-
age done to veterans’ credit within 90 days of
enactment of the Act. The Committees ex-
pect that the Department will implement
measures to avoid similar outcomes in the
future.
Reporting on VA Healthcare Facilities for
Treatment of Women.—The agreement directs
the Department to submit a report to the
Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress no later than 90 days
after enactment of this Act, and annually
thereafter, with the following information:
the number of facilities in each model of de-
livery of care to women (by VISN and by
State); the criteria used to determine which
model is most appropriate for each facility;
the triggers or criteria to upgrade facilities
to the next higher model; plans, if any, to
upgrade facilities from the lowest model
(General Primary Care Clinics) to a higher
model within planned Strategic Capital In-
vestment Planning (SCIP) investments; and
whether VA has a plan or goal for how many
facilities should fall into each of the models
of care.
MEDICAL SERVICES
The agreement provides $56,158,015,000 in
advance for fiscal year 2021 for Medical Serv-
ices and makes $1,500,000,000 of the advance
available through fiscal year 2022. The agree-
ment includes bill language requiring the
Secretary to ensure that sufficient amounts
are available for the acquisition of pros-
thetics designed specifically for female vet-
erans. Of the amounts provided, the agree-
ment provides that at least $585,000,000 shall
be dedicated to gender-specific care for
women.
Caregivers Support
The agreement includes $710,000,000 for
VA’s Caregivers Program, which VA is ex-
pected to dedicate to the Caregivers Pro-
gram and not divert resources to other areas.
The Department should note that notifica-
tion should be provided to the Committees of
any attempts to reprogram this funding.
Expansion and Support for Caregivers.—The
Caregivers Program was enhanced as part of
the VA MISSION Act, and the Department is
expected to carry out this expansion accord-
ing to the statutory timeline, and to fully
staff the program, including ensuring that
the Caregiver Coordinators at each Medical
Center are fully resourced and, to the max-
imum extent possible, assigned designated
caregiver duties as their chief and only re-
sponsibility. The agreement directs VA to
provide quarterly projections and monthly
expenditure reports for the Caregivers Pro-
gram to the Committees on Appropriations
of both Houses of Congress. These reports
should also highlight any changes to the im-
plementation schedule due to the Depart-
ment’s decision-making delays, as well as
the timing of information technology re-
quirements.
Additionally, the Committees are con-
cerned by recent actions of the Department
to implement policy changes that would
limit eligibility of veterans and caregivers or
curtail the support services provided to
them. Any steps to limit eligibility are re-
jected by the Congress and the agreement di-
rects the Department to submit a report de-
tailing justification no later than 180 days
prior to any changes in eligibility criteria
not made as a result of public law.
The Committees recognize that many care-
givers for severely wounded veterans face a
reduction in outside earnings, resulting in
difficulties meeting financial obligations, in-
cluding student loan debt held by the care-
giver. The agreement directs the Department
to survey all caregivers currently in the pro-
gram who seek the financial planning serv-
ices required under the VA MISSION Act, in
order to identify the number possessing out-
standing student loan debt, and to develop a
plan to monitor this issue, including pro-
viding counseling related to student loan and
other debt management, under such finan-
cial planning services to caregivers required
by the VA MISSION Act.
Mental Health
Mental Health and Suicide Prevention.—The
agreement provides $9,432,833,000 in discre-
tionary funds for mental health programs,
which is $20,000,000 above the budget request,
and includes $221,765,000 for suicide preven-
tion outreach. The Secretary is directed to
make any necessary improvements to Vet-
erans Crisis Line (VCL) operations including,
but not limited to, ensuring appropriate
staffing for call centers and back-up centers,
providing necessary training for VCL staff,
and ensuring that staff are able to appro-
priately and effectively respond to the needs
of veterans needing assistance. The Sec-
retary is also directed to provide the Com-
mittees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress a report, no later than 90 days after
enactment of this Act, which contains an up-
date detailing findings on the outcomes and
efficacy of the VCL from the Veterans Crisis
Line Study Act of 2017.
The agreement also maintains the direc-
tion provided in House Report 116–63 for VA
to implement a safety plan to address park-
ing lot suicides and expand the Coaching
Into Care program, remove barriers that im-
pact a veteran’s ability to receive mental
healthcare, and implement a program to
educate local law enforcement on how to
deal with veterans during a mental health
crisis. This report should also address the
status of recommendations from the OIG fol-
lowing investigations of specific suicides on
VA campuses.
In addition, the agreement directs the De-
partment to provide a report no later than 60
days after enactment, and quarterly there-
after, a detailed expenditure plan for suicide
outreach and treatment programs, how VA is
meeting the Committees’ directives, and up-
dates on obligations to date. Furthermore,
the agreement directs the Department to
staff every VA Medical Center with at least
one suicide prevention coordinator.
National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder.—The agreement supports the mis-
sion and work of the National Center for
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and has pro-
vided $40,000,000, which includes $10,000,000
for the coordination of the VA National
PTSD Brain Bank, to continue the center’s
advancement of the clinical care and social
welfare of America’s veterans, through re-
search, education, and training in the
science, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD
and stress-related disorders.
PREVENTS Initiative.—The agreement in-
cludes $3,000,000 for VA’s efforts to coordi-
nate veteran suicide prevention efforts under
the Presidential Task Force established
under the PREVENTS Initiative, as directed
in House Report 116–63.
Expansion of Mental Health Benefits to
Guard and Reservists.—The agreement ac-
knowledges the importance of providing
mental healthcare to all warfighters, which
includes Guard and Reservists. The Commit-
tees recognize that these individuals may
benefit from access to mental health services
provided by VA—including suicide preven-
tion services—even if they were not acti-
vated under Federal orders. Therefore, the
agreement directs the Department to provide
a report to the Committees on Appropria-
tions of both Houses of Congress no later
than 180 days after enactment of this Act on
the feasibility of extending access to these
services to all members of the National
Guard and Reserves, regardless of their Fed-
eral activation status. This report shall in-
clude the costs associated with this effort,
an estimate of the impact on capacity, as
well as any relevant legislative language
needed to accomplish this goal.
Reduce Suicide, Relapse, and Hospital Vis-
its.—The agreement encourages VA to con-
sider the use of cutting-edge, off-the-shelf
technology and pharmacy management pro-
tocols as tools to reduce suicide, relapse and
hospital visits by veterans treated for men-
tal health issues, including PTSD and TBI.
Vets Corps.—The agreement provides up to
$2,500,000 to carry out the direction provided
in House Report 116–63 regarding Vets Corps.
REACH Veteran in Crisis Initiative.—The
agreement supports the Recovery Engage-
ment and Coordination for Health—Veterans
Enhanced Treatment (REACH VET) pro-
gram. The Department is encouraged to
work in partnership with the Department of
Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory to
update and improve predictive models and
expand the use of predictive analytics for de-
cision support and identification of veterans
in need and at risk.
Prescription Practices.—The June 2019 GAO
report, ‘‘VA Mental Health: VHA Improved
Certain Prescribing Practices, but Needs to
Strengthen Treatment Plan Oversight’’
(GAO–19–465) reviewed how mental health
treatment decisions are made by providers in
VA Medical Centers and monitored by VHA.

GAO recommendations in this report.
Sleep Disorders.—Senate Report 115–269,
which accompanied the FY 2019 appropria-
tions, included a recommendation for the De-
partment to assign a program manager for
sleep disorders. The Department indicated it
would make a determination upon comple-
tion of the Healthcare Analytics and Infor-
mation Group’s survey of existing resources
and practices. The agreement directs the De-
partment to provide an update on this review
and recommendation to the Committees on
Appropriations of both Houses of Congress
no later than June 30, 2020.
Homeless Assistance
The agreement provides $1,847,466,000 for
homeless assistance programs, which is
$28,932,000 above the budget request. This in-
cludes $380,000,000 for the Supportive Serv-
ices for Veteran Families program;
$408,300,000 for the Housing and Urban Devel-
opment-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing
(HUD–VASH) program case management;
$250,000,000 for the Grant and Per Diem Pro-
gram; and $69,107,000 for the Veterans Justice
Outreach Program.
Homeless Women Veterans.—The Secretary
is directed to report to the Committees on
Appropriations of both Houses of Congress
within 180 days of enactment of this Act on
the growing number of women veterans who
are homeless or unstably housed and the pro-
grams intended to serve them. The report
should identify if and how the programs are
failing and include a plan to address any de-
ficiencies.
Veteran Homeless Report.—The Secretary is
directed to prepare a report in consultation
with DOD and the U.S. Interagency Council
on Homelessness on the progress made to
date to ensure servicemembers identified
through the Transition Assistance Program
process as lacking viable housing options re-
ceive appropriate housing-related assistance.
The report shall be provided to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress within 120 days of enactment of
this Act and include: 1) data for fiscal years
2018 and 2019; 2) the number and percentage
of transitioning servicemembers who are
evaluated as not having a viable post-transi-
tion housing plan; 3) and of those, a) the
number and percentage who receive a warm
handover from DOD to VA; b) the number
who received services from appropriate VA
homeless program staff; and c) and are iden-
tified as experiencing homelessness.
Limited Affordable Housing.—The Secretary
is directed to provide an update on the ef-
fects of limited affordable housing opportu-
nities on the Department’s homeless pro-
grams in rural communities. The report also
should include recommendations on ways the
Department and local housing entities can
better partner to ensure access to housing
for veterans in rural and high-cost urban
areas and be provided to the Committees on
Appropriations of both Houses of Congress
within 180 days of enactment of this Act.
Supportive Services for Veteran Families
(SSVF).—Although funds were appropriated,
the Department’s policy decisions led to
fluctuations in funding to grantees and pos-
sible gaps in services being provided. The
agreement provides for at least $380,000,000 in
grant awards in fiscal year 2020 and encour-
ages the Department to plan for $400,000,000
in fiscal year 2021 to expand to other loca-
tions to address gaps in services, as appro-
priate. The Secretary is directed to submit a
report describing the effectiveness of the
SSVF program; results of the gap analysis;
and a plan to expand the program, as appro-
priate, to address service gaps within 90 days
of enactment of this Act to the Committees
on Appropriations of both Houses of Con-
gress.
HUD–VASH.—Due to concerns the Depart-
ment is not properly staffing its HUD–VASH
program to meet the needs of changing
homeless populations, the Secretary is di-
rected to submit a report to the Committees
on Appropriations of both Houses of Con-
gress within 90 days of enactment of this
Act. The report shall include details regard-
ing: 1) the process by which each VA medical
center fills their HUD–VASH case manage-
ment positions; 2) the current ratio of HUD–
VASH case managers to veterans for each
VA medical center; 3) a list of all vacant spe-
cific purpose-funded positions to support the
HUD–VASH program; 4) steps taken to re-
cruit and retain case managers for this pro-
gram; 5) a list of VA Medical Centers where
HUD–VASH cases are being contracted out;
6) a list of the current allocations of HUD–
VASH vouchers by State; 7) a list of requests
for additional HUD–VASH vouchers received
by the Department and the outcome of such
requests; and 8) efforts currently underway
to assist HUD–VASH case management in
highly rural areas.
Homeless Providers Grants Per Diem (GPD)
Program.—The agreement supports the De-
partment’s goal of a systemic end to veteran
homelessness and agrees that service-inten-
sive transitional housing provided through
VA’s GPD Program is an important tool in
this effort. The agreement provides
$250,000,000, an increase of $23,932,000 over the
request, for GPD. The most appropriate mix
of housing services for veterans should be de-
termined locally through a collaborative
process including local housing partners,
service providers, and VA medical centers,
and VA should continue to make funding
available for GPD beds based on this process.
The Department is directed to submit a re-
port to the Committees on Appropriations of
both Houses of Congress no later than 180
days after enactment of this Act on the con-
tingency/remediation plans that current pro-
viders serving rural or highly rural areas
have for veterans that may be affected by
changes in availability or the loss of GPD
Program funds that would result in the loss
of their access to transitional housing assist-
ance.
Veterans Justice Outreach (VJO) Program.—
The agreement provides $5,000,000 over the
budget request to support the VJO Program
and its goal to prevent homelessness and
avoid the unnecessary criminalization of
mental illness and extended incarceration
among veterans by ensuring eligible vet-
erans encountered by police, and in jails or
courts, have timely access to VA services,
including mental health, substance abuse,
and homeless programs.
Clinical Workforce
Healthcare Workforce.—VHA’s ability to re-
cruit and retain quality clinical and support
staff remains a concern. Accordingly, the
agreement directs the Department to comply
with GAO’s recommendations to improve
staffing, recruitment, and retention strate-
gies for clinicians.
Mental Health Staffing.—There is a growing
need for mental health professionals, and VA
should maintain appropriate mental health
staffing levels to provide veterans timely, ef-
fective, high-quality care. The agreement di-
rects the Department to prioritize the hiring
of mental health professionals and to keep
the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress apprised on a quarterly
basis on meeting its hiring goals, including
actions taken to improve recruitment and
retention across the country, and specifi-
cally in rural areas. This report should in-
clude updates to the ratio of faculty staff to
outpatient mental health veterans being
treated for mental health needs.
Rural Recruitment.—To improve recruit-
ment and retention initiatives for healthcare
providers in rural and highly rural areas the
agreement urges the Department to conform
with the recommendations contained in GAO
report, GAO–181–24. The agreement directs
the Department to provide a report to the
Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress no later than 90 days
after enactment of this Act on the status of
compliance with these recommendations.
Credentialing.—The agreement strongly en-
courages VA to expand the Military Transi-
tion and Training Advancement Course na-
tionally in order to facilitate the recruit-
ment of separating military personnel who
served in the healthcare field. The agree-
ment directs VHA to identify remaining bar-
riers to expediting the credentialing process
for qualified licensed personnel, and to re-
port on such barriers and limitations to the
Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress within 180 days after en-
actment of this Act.
In addition, a recent GAO report found
that greater focus on credentialing is needed
to prevent disqualified providers from deliv-
ering patient care. The agreement urges the
Secretary to implement the GAO rec-
ommendations to improve Departmental
oversight over VHA facility credentialing
policies. The agreement directs the Depart-
ment to provide a progress report on imple-
mentation of such recommendations to the
Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress within 60 days after en-
actment of this Act.
Orthotics & Prosthetics Workforce.—The sus-
tainability of the orthotics and prosthetics
workforce treating veterans, particularly
given an aging workforce with imminent re-
tirements as well as a lack of availability of
advanced degree programs necessary to train
new professionals is a concern. VHA’s
Orthotic and Prosthetic Residency Program
provides rotation opportunities through the
VA system, but this program alone is inad-
equate to ensure a sustainable workforce for
the future, especially in light of the skill set
necessary to provide the increasingly com-
plex, state-of-the-art orthotics and pros-
thetics care for Iraq and Afghanistan war
veterans. The agreement directs VA to work
with outside industry experts to survey and
examine the latest data available on the cur-
rent extent of orthotics and prosthetics care
provided outside of VA facilities and provide
projections on requirements over the next
decade based on overall population growth
among veterans with orthotics and pros-
thetics needs. This information is to be re-
ported to the Committees on Appropriations
of both Houses of Congress within 180 days of
enactment of this Act.
Physician Assistants.—VA has failed to uti-
lize existing authorities to hire and retain
Physician Assistants (PAs). As such, the
agreement directs VA to accelerate the roll-
out of competitive pay for PAs, to develop a
plan on how to better utilize the Health Pro-
fessional Scholarship Program and Edu-
cation Debt Reduction Program, and to de-
velop a staffing plan on how to utilize PAs
within the Department.
Medical Staff Retention.—The agreement ex-
pands upon the Medical Staff Retention re-
ports directed in House Report 116–63. In ad-
dition, the Department is directed to submit
a report to the Committees on Appropria-
tions and Veterans’ Affairs of both Houses of
Congress within 90 days detailing compliance
with its policy to (1) conduct reviews of each
healthcare provider of the Department who
transfers to another medical facility of the
Department, resigns, retires, or is termi-
nated to determine whether there are any
concerns, complaints, or allegations of viola-
tions relating to the medical practice of the

healthcare provider; and (2) to take appro-
priate action with respect to any such con-
cern, complaint, or allegation. The Depart-
ment previously informed Congress it was
implementing an auditing tool to require
medical facilities to certify compliance with
these policies to their respective VISN lead-
ership. The agreement requests that a sum-
mary of this auditing tool also be included in
this report.
VA/DOD Clinical Practice Guidelines.—The
Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense
have created VA/DOD Clinical Practice
Guidelines for many conditions that affect
both veterans and active duty
servicemembers. Currently, VA and DOD do
not have guidelines for the comorbidity of
trauma (e.g., PTSD, TBI, Military Sexual
Trauma) and substance use disorder or
chronic pain, despite the fact that many vet-
erans and active duty servicemembers are
suffering from multiple conditions. It is cru-
cial that frontline clinicians are informed
about the most effective treatments for
these conditions when they are co-occurring.
The agreement strongly encourages VA and
DOD to work together to create Clinical
Practice Guidelines for the treatment of
trauma, including PTSD, TBI, and Military
Sexual Trauma, that is comorbid with sub-
stance use disorder or chronic pain.
Rural Healthcare
Office of Rural Health.—The agreement
notes that veterans residing in rural and re-
mote areas face unique barriers to receiving
high-quality mental health, primary
healthcare, and specialty care services.
While enhanced community care programs
offer veterans increased flexibility to obtain
care close to home, often this same gap in
services exists in the private market in rural
and remote communities. Over the past 10
years, the Office of Rural Health (ORH) and
its Rural Health Initiative has played a crit-
ical role in assisting VA in its efforts to in-
crease access to care. Therefore, the agree-
ment provides $300,000,000 for ORH and the
Rural Health Initiative.
The agreement supports Rural Health Re-
source Centers, operated by ORH, and en-
courages the Department to increase the
number of these centers. Any expansion
should also emphasize increasing access to
healthcare for women veterans, treating
traumatic brain injuries, and recruiting and
retaining healthcare providers to serve rural
and remote areas.
The agreement also encourages continued
operation of a nurse advice line at all VA
medical centers, including facilities serving
rural areas and highly rural areas, as a way
to reach a large percentage of veteran enroll-
ees. The agreement further supports the con-
tinuation of the efforts of the Department’s
Community Clergy Training to Support
Rural Veterans Mental Health Initiative.
The Department is urged to increase the fi-
nancial resources made available in order to
increase accessibility of this initiative to
rural communities.
The Department is reminded of the direc-
tions regarding rural transportation in-
cluded in House Report 116–63.
Rural Health Continuity of Care.—The Com-
mittees note the Access Received Closer to
Home (ARCH) pilot program was highly suc-
cessful in some areas in providing healthcare
services to veterans who live in the rural and
highly rural States in which it operated, and
that veterans who received medical care
through the ARCH pilot program were ‘‘com-
pletely satisfied’’ with their care and cited
significantly shortened travel and wait times
to receive care. As the Department transi-
tions to a new community care program es-
tablished by the VA MISSION Act, the
agreement encourages the Secretary to sus-
tain continuity of care for rural veterans
through provider agreements, based on pre-
vious models such as the ARCH program, to
ensure veterans do not experience a lapse in
existing healthcare access during the transi-
tion to the new community care program
and any resulting integrated networks. The
Committees continue to support enabling
the Department to enter into provider agree-
ments with non-VA long-term care pro-
viders, including skilled nursing facilities.
Home-Based Primary Care.—The agreement
supports the collaboration between VA and
the Indian Health Service (IHS) and collabo-
ration by Federal agencies with Tribes to ex-
pand access to care for Native veterans, in-
cluding the recent expansion of evidence-
based home-based primary care (HBPC) pro-
grams at 14 VA medical centers. This expan-
sion is designed to reach new populations of
American Indian veterans living in rural res-
ervation communities, which are served by
medical facilities operated directly by IHS
or by Tribes and Tribal organizations with
funding provided by IHS. The agreement
urges the Secretary to increase funding
within ORH to expand HBPC programs to ad-
ditional American Indian reservations and to
other rural areas, and to continue to im-
prove planning coordination with other Fed-
eral healthcare organizations. Planning ef-
forts should take into account conducting a
population-based needs assessment and al-
lowing sufficient time to develop trusting re-
lationships with Native veterans, Tribal
health and social service personnel, IHS and
Tribal community health representatives,
and Tribal communities. Planning efforts
should also consider availability of IHS and
Tribal resources for patients, as well as iden-
tify potential opportunities for co-manage-
ment to prevent unintended duplication of
effort, over-prescribing of medications, and
other inefficiencies.
GENDER-SPECIFIC CARE FOR WOMEN
Gender-Specific Care for Women.—The agree-
ment provides $585,000,000 for gender-specific
care for women, which is $38,486,000 over the
budget request. The agreement directs VA to
continue redesigning its women’s healthcare
delivery system and facilities to ensure
women receive equitable, timely, and high-
quality healthcare. The agreement further
directs VA to prioritize hiring women pri-
mary care providers and psychologists for
women clinics, employees for women-specific
services, and women peer support specialists.
The agreement directs women’s health pro-
gram managers to be full-time jobs and not
to be tasked with supplemental responsibil-
ities outside their specified job descriptions.
The agreement supports the expansion of the
Women’s Health Mini-Residency program.
OPIOID SAFETY INITIATIVES AND SUBSTANCE
USE DISORDER CARE
To continue to build upon opioid reduction
efforts and safety initiatives, the agreement
includes $402,000,000 for Opioid Prevention
and Treatment programs at VA. This in-
cludes $345,946,000 for prevention and treat-
ment programs, and $56,054,000 to continue
implementation of the Comprehensive Addic-
tion and Recovery Act of 2016 (Public Law
114–198).
Office of Patient Advocacy.—The Commit-
tees believe that the Jason Simcakoski Me-
morial and Promise Act’s (Title IX, Public
Law 114–198) establishment of the Office of
Patient Advocacy will ensure that patient
advocates put the interests of the veterans
they serve first, not the interests of the fa-
cility. Accordingly, within 90 days of enact-
ment, the agreement directs the Department
to provide a report to the Committees on Ap-
propriations and Veterans’ Affairs of both
Houses of Congress on its progress imple-
menting the relevant sections of Public Law
114–198, including progress on all six rec-
ommendations from GAO’s April 2018 report
(GAO–18–356), and the specific training and
instructions Patient Advocates are given to
escalate a concern outside of a VA facility
when they believe a VA facility is not acting
in the best interest of the veteran.
Improvement of Opioid Safety Initiative.—The
Committees support VA’s Opioid Safety Ini-
tiative (OSI) and encourage continued imple-
mentation at all VA medical facilities, as di-
rected under the Jason Simcakoski Memo-
rial and Promise Act. The Committees ac-
knowledge overall improvements in opioid
safety at VA and believe that it is impera-
tive that all VA providers who prescribe
opioids continue to consistently use the
Opioid Therapy Risk Report tool under the
OSI. In May 2018, GAO submitted report
GAO–18–380 to Congress detailing the Depart-
ment’s progress made towards improving
opioid safety, and VA set a target date of
April 2019 to satisfy and closeout the five
recommendations. The agreement directs
the Department to submit a report to the
Committees on Appropriations and Veterans’
Affairs of both Houses of Congress detailing
the actions to address each finding and rec-
ommendation made by this report within 90
days of enactment of this Act. Additionally,
this should include a report on efforts to en-
sure that VA medical centers have estab-
lished an additional control procedure, in ac-
cordance with GAO recommendations to im-
prove oversight of the controlled substance
inspection program.
Furthermore, to ensure that VA physicians
have equal opportunity to prescribe effec-
tive, lower risk, safer Schedule III (CIII)
opioids before prescribing highly potent and
addictive Schedule II opioids, the agreement
recommends that the Pharmacy Benefits
Management Services consider clarifying
guidance related to dispensing CIII opioids.
Community Care Opioid Safety.—The Com-
mittees recognize that VA has made impor-
tant progress increasing opioid safety and re-
ducing overprescribing within the VA
healthcare system. However, the Department
still needs to make comparable progress im-
plementing opioid safety reforms in VA com-
munity care programs. The July 2017 OIG re-
port (VA OIG 17–01846–316) on opioid pre-
scribing in VA community care programs
provides further evidence that veterans re-
ceiving opioid therapy from community care
providers are at significant risk, due to lack
of consistent tracking and limited awareness
of VA opioid therapy and safe prescribing
protocols. The agreement directs the Depart-
ment to provide a report to the Committees
on Appropriations and Veterans’ Affairs of
both Houses of Congress on implementation
of all OIG recommendations and statutory
requirements within the VA MISSION Act
within 90 days after enactment of this Act.
VA participation in State Prescription
Drug Monitoring Programs, as required in
the VA Prescription Data Accountability
Act of 2017 (Public Law 115–144), is a critical
component to an effort to ensure a patient’s
prescription history is available to all pre-
scribers. No later than February 1, 2021, the
agreement directs VA to submit a report to
the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress identifying progress to-
ward full participation in State Prescription
Drug Monitoring Programs during calendar
year 2020, broken out by VISN and Medical
Facility. The agreement also encourages VA,
to the maximum extent permitted by law, to
share prescription drug information with
other Federal medical facilities that may
serve veterans, including DOD medical facili-
ties and Indian Health Service facilities.
Complementary and Integrative Health.—Ex-
panding access to comprehensive pain man-
agement and complementary and integrative

health (CIH) services is vital to improving
the delivery of high-quality care for vet-
erans. The agreement urges robust imple-
mentation of VA’s plan to expand the scope
of research, education, delivery, and integra-
tion of CIH into the healthcare services pro-
vided to veterans, and as required under sec-
tion 932 of the Jason Simcakoski Memorial
and Promise Act, VA must continue to
prioritize implementation of the pilot pro-
gram at VA medical centers, including
polytrauma rehabilitation centers, to assess
the feasibility and advisability of delivery
using wellness-based programs to com-
plement pain management and related
healthcare services. The Department is en-
couraged to continue to expand access to
CIH services as part of the VA’s Whole
Health System approach.
Substance Use Disorder Care.—The Commit-
tees support VA’s ongoing efforts to reduce
wait times for substance use disorder (SUD)
treatment by balancing nationwide care
within the Residential Rehabilitation Treat-
ment Programs (RRTP). However, the Com-
mittees are aware that the median wait time
between screening and admission for non-pri-
ority SUD RRTP care remained unaccept-
ably high. The agreement urges the Depart-
ment to improve efforts to address the un-
even and limited distribution of inpatient
addiction crisis detoxification beds that em-
ploy a medical/psychosocial approach, a sup-
ply of Medication Assisted Treatment in-
cluding availability of appointments for vet-
eran access to buprenorphine, alternative co-
adjuvant therapies to reduce anxiety, and
mobile tools aimed at concurrent recovery
and relapse prevention. The agreement urges
the Department to expand existing success-
ful model behavioral-health programs in
partnership with community providers in
high-demand treatment areas with proven,
veteran-specific, evidence-based, one-stop-
shop (integrated), SUD treatment that go be-
yond basic ‘‘shelter care.’’ These public-pri-
vate partnerships should encompass the full
continuum of care for veterans suffering
from SUD (detoxification/recovery, sober
housing), and those at risk of suicide due to
SUD. Additionally, the agreement directs
the Department to provide a report to the
Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress, within 90 days of enact-
ment of this Act, that shall include average
wait times for priority, routine and residen-
tial SUD care; the results of efforts to bal-
ance RRTP availability; projected RRTP
wait times for fiscal years 2020 and 2021; and
plans to scale successful evidence-based, in-
tegrated SUD care model programs.
Overmedication of Veterans.—In fiscal year
2018, the Congress provided $500,000 for VA to
enter into an agreement with the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine (NASEM) to conduct an assessment
of the potential overmedication of veterans
during fiscal years 2010 to 2017 that led to
suicides, deaths, mental disorders, and com-
bat-related traumas. Though the Commit-
tees are frustrated that, rather than con-
ducting a study, the Department used the
full amount of funding to contract for a
study design, NASEM provided a credible
study design report entitled, An Approach to
Evaluate the Effects of Concomitant Prescribing
of Opioids and Benzodiazepines on Veterans
Deaths and Suicides. As such, the agreement
directs the Department to work in close con-
sultation and coordination with NASEM to
implement the study design to evaluate and
understand the effects of opioids and
benzodiazepine on veteran suicides. The
agreement directs the Department to brief
the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress no later than 60 days
after enactment of this Act on the proposed
study design to be implemented, and to pro-
vide periodic updates thereafter.
Whole Health
Whole Health.—The agreement provides
$63,600,000 for the Whole Health initiative,
which is $10,000,000 above the budget request.
The agreement directs VA to expand its use
of interactive patient care and to ensure co-
ordination and standardization of the field
implementation of the Whole Health initia-
tive. The agreement provides up to $5,000,000
for creative arts therapies. The agreement
further directs the Department to submit
complete and detailed accounting of the
Whole Health program in the fiscal year 2021
budget request.
Alternative Therapies.—The agreement di-
rects VA to study the feasibility and advis-
ability of making yoga, meditation, creative
arts therapy, chiropractic care, and acupunc-
ture also accessible as treatment for mental
health conditions, including suicide risk, to
veterans at all Department facilities, either
in person, or through telehealth.
Other Items of Interest
Central Alabama Veterans Health Care Sys-
tem (CAVHCS).—The Department is directed
to address the deficiencies at CAVHCS, as
identified in House Report 116–63.
Pressure Ulcer Prevention and Trans-
parency.—Although the Department issued a
policy directive on the prevention and man-
agement of pressure injuries, and is explor-
ing non-invasive innovative biometric sensor
technologies that have produced promising
results in the early detection of pressure ul-
cers, more can be done. The agreement di-
rects the Department to address pressure
ulcer prevention and transparency, as identi-
fied in House Report 116–63, though the
agreement does not specify funds for the
pilot. The agreement directs the Under Sec-
retary for Health to complete the directed
assessment within 120 days of enactment of
this Act. In addition, the agreement encour-
ages the Department to consider incor-
porating into its directive the steps included
in the peer-reviewed Standardized Pressure
Injury Prevention Protocols.
Access for Veterans in the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands, American
Samoa, Guam, and Freely Associated States.—
The Committees remain concerned about the
challenges for veterans residing in the Free-
ly Associated States (FAS) to access the
quality healthcare they have earned through
their military service. Given the significant
time, resources, and high costs for travel for
some veterans, including airfare, transpor-
tation, and lodging, many FAS veterans are
never able to access VA health services. The
agreement urges the Department to enhance
access to care for these veterans. The Com-
mittees are seeking to understand potential
obstacles in data collection to account for
the number of veterans residing in the FAS,
and how VA can improve data collection
from the outlying areas to help inform the
development of proposals to ensure that
health needs of these veterans are met. The
agreement directs the Department to con-
duct a survey related to barriers veterans
may face in utilizing VA services and other
benefits when living in outlying and remote
areas, and to provide a report to the Com-
mittees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress on the findings of this survey, an
assessment of options for improving access
to VA healthcare for FAS veterans, as well
as the outreach efforts taken to inform FAS
and remotely located veterans about enroll-
ment in the Foreign Medical Program. This
report is directed to be provided within 270
days of enactment of this Act.
Furthermore, the agreement directs the
Department to increase access to VA care for
veterans living in remote and underserved
areas of the FAS by increasing the number
of full-time, dedicated, VA medical and men-
tal health providers in these areas, as well as
to work with Federal and non-Federal part-
ners, including the Departments of Defense,
Interior, and Health and Human Services,
community healthcare facilities and edu-
cational institutions to leverage shared re-
sources and improve access for delivery of
care through technology and collaboration.
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learn-
ing.—The Department is reminded of the re-
port requested in House Report 116–63.
Orthotics and Prosthetics.—The Department
is expected to ensure veterans continue to
receive the prosthetics services that best
meet their needs in the final Orthotics and
Prosthetics regulation.
Veterans Exposed to Open Burn Pits and Air-
borne Hazards.—In order to provide full and
effective medical care, it is essential for the
Department to better understand the im-
pacts that exposure during service has had
on the health of veterans. Therefore, the
agreement supports language included in
House Report 116–63, including $5,000,000 to
carry out responsibilities and activities of
the Airborne Hazards and Burn Pits Center
of Excellence.
Community Wellness Programs.—VA has not
yet implemented the VSO Wellness pilot pro-
gram, authorized in Section 252 of the Con-
solidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (Public
Law 115–141). It is concerning that the De-
partment is still in the process of estab-
lishing this program and may not be pre-
pared to launch until fiscal year 2021. The
agreement directs the Department to expedi-
tiously implement the program, and further
directs the Department to provide quarterly
status updates to the Committees on Appro-
priations of both Houses of Congress.
Intimate Partner Violence Program.—The
agreement supports VA’s efforts to expand
its Intimate Partner Violence Program to all
sites within the next 2 years, and its plans to
screen all veterans for Intimate Partner Vio-
lence and provide the appropriate resources.
The agreement directs VA to fully resource
this program at $20,300,000, as requested, in
fiscal year 2020 and include it as a program
of interest with budget detail in the jus-
tifications accompanying the fiscal year 2021
budget submission.
Adaptive Sports.—The agreement includes
$24,309,000 for National Veterans Sports Pro-
grams, including $16,000,000 for adaptive
sports programs. Veterans have shown
marked improvements in mental and phys-
ical health from participating in adaptive
sports and recreational therapy and veterans
have expressed the need for these activities
to be included in the healthcare services VA
offers. The Committees also recognize that
adaptive sports and recreational therapy
provide a low-cost alternative to other
healthcare services that produce similar
health outcomes. The Department is directed
to make recreational and lifelong sports,
such as open-ocean swimming, surfing, out-
rigger canoeing, hunting, and fishing eligible
for grants.
Equine Therapy.—The agreement rec-
ommends the Department use $1,500,000 of
funds for the adaptive sports program for
equine therapy. Moreover, the Department
should utilize funding to conduct a com-
prehensive program evaluation to ensure the
continued effectiveness of equine therapy in
addressing the mental health needs of vet-
erans that participate in these programs, in-
cluding through the systematic assessment
and tracking of mental health issues and
symptoms, and the measurement of key out-
comes, such as functional improvement in
veterans’ different life domains.
Beneficiary Travel.—The allocation of bene-
ficiary travel to VISNs where unconven-
tional modes of travel, such as air, are the
primary means for veterans to visit a VA
VerDate Sep 11 2014 23:32 Dec 22, 2019 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00342 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A17DE7.059 H17DEPT3

hospital remains a concern. Beneficiary
travel is often expected to be paid out of
pocket by the veteran, and then reimbursed
by the Department at some later date, even
for those veterans whose care is determined
to be necessary by VA. This is an above aver-
age burden for veterans who live in rural and
highly remote areas where veterans travel
long distances to appointments using atypi-
cal means of transportation, such as by air,
and must pay to stay overnight in area ho-
tels. The agreement urges the Department to
staff each facility with at least one full-time
employee to manage beneficiary travel, in
order to speed reimbursements to veterans,
and also to identify ways in which VA might
be able to cover more of these veterans’ costs
up front.
DOD and VA Prescription Purchasing.—The
agreement encourages VA to work with DOD
on the feasibility of aligning their struc-
tures, statutory parameters, and regulatory
guidance in order to increase buying power
and reduce the cost of the prescription buy-
ing program, and to report findings to the
Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress.
Canadian Forces Base Gagetown.—Many Na-
tional Guard veterans engaged in training
activities at Canadian Forces Base (CFB)
Gagetown in the 1950s and 1960s. The Com-
mittees are also aware that Veterans Affairs
Canada approved one-time, lump sum pay-
ments to eligible veterans exposed to Agent
Orange and other defoliants who served at
CFB Gagetown; and that veterans who served
there between June 20 and June 24, 1964, are
currently eligible for an Agent Orange Reg-
istry Health Exam from the Veterans Health
Administration. The agreement urges the
Department to establish and maintain a
health registry for American veterans who
were stationed or underwent training at CFB
Gagetown and who have subsequently experi-
enced health problems which may be attrib-
uted to Agent Orange or other defoliants.
The agreement further urges the Department
to commission an independent study tasked
with investigating the linkage between serv-
ice at CFB Gagetown and the development of
health problems and disease associated with
exposure to Agent Orange.
Emergency Ambulance Reimbursement.—VA
has made efforts to improve claims reim-
bursement processes for emergency ambu-
lance service providers, however, continued
problems with emergency ambulance trans-
portation services result in lengthy claims
payment delays or unwarranted financial
burdens on veterans. The agreement urges
the Department to take any necessary ac-
tions to process such claims using the ‘‘pru-
dent layperson’’ standard for claims of emer-
gency ambulance transportation of veterans
to non-VA facilities. The agreement further
directs the Department to provide a brief to
the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress no later than 90 days
after enactment of this Act to update the
Committees on the Department’s efforts to
streamline reimbursement of claims by
emergency ambulance service providers.
This brief should include an assessment by
VA of the impacts of permitting conditional
payments to ambulance service providers
while seeking reimbursement from third-
party payers where such payers have not
made payment within 120 days of the date on
which emergency ambulance services are
provided, similar to Medicare program prac-
tices.
Pilot Programs for Agritherapy.—The agree-
ment provides $5,000,000 to continue a pilot
program to train veterans in agricultural vo-
cations, while also tending to behavioral and
mental health needs with behavioral
healthcare services and treatments by li-
censed providers at no fewer than three loca-
tions.
Lovell Federal Health Care Center.—The Cap-
tain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care
Center Demonstration Project, established
in 2010 under the National Defense Author-
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law
111–84), is an innovative collaboration be-
tween VA and DOD. The Lovell Federal
Health Care Center has significant potential
to improve access, quality, and cost-effec-
tiveness of healthcare delivery to veterans,
servicemembers, and their families; and al-
ready serves as a valuable site dem-
onstrating comprehensive cooperation and
interoperability between VA and DOD. The
important work of this integration effort
must continue as the two Departments con-
tinue to roll out their respective electronic
health record programs.
Alaska Federal Health Care Partnerships.—
The Alaska VA Healthcare System leader-
ship is investigating whether a partnership
with DOD, the Coast Guard, and Tribal
healthcare delivery could improve access and
quality of care to all Federal healthcare
beneficiaries in Alaska with substantial cost
savings. The agreement encourages VA to
consult with its Federal and Tribal counter-
parts, and with other stakeholders, including
VA employee groups and community pro-
viders, with respect to the benefits which
might accrue from adoption of this model,
and to report periodically to the Committees
on Appropriations of both Houses of Con-
gress on the progress of these discussions.
Support for Vet Centers in Rural Commu-
nities.—Vet Centers across the country pro-
vide a broad range of counseling, outreach,
and referral services to eligible veterans, ac-
tive duty servicemembers, and their fami-
lies, to include individuals with problematic
discharges. The Committees believe Vet Cen-
ters are critical in rural communities, and
the agreement encourages the Department
to fully staff these resources.
Readjustment Counseling.—The Depart-
ment’s Vet Centers and Mobile Vet Centers
provide important readjustment counseling
services. The Department also partners with
organizations that provide outdoor experi-
ences for veterans as part of a continuum of
care to support veterans in developing a
community of support to treat combat-re-
lated injuries, including those related to be-
havioral health. The agreement directs the
Department to submit a report to the Com-
mittees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress no later than 120 days after enact-
ment of this Act to highlight best practices
of Vet Centers, including partnerships to
provide outdoor experiences, and to include a
plan to disseminate the findings, as well as
incorporate into criteria for additional sites.
The report should address whether successful
programs should be replicated in other areas.
Telehealth Services.—The agreement in-
cludes an additional $30,000,000 to increase
telehealth capacity in rural and highly rural
areas. The agreement directs VA to develop
a plan to improve veteran and provider satis-
faction, increase awareness of the telehealth
program, and enhance adoption of telehealth
by veterans and providers. The Department’s
plan should include actions that will be
taken to make telehealth more accessible to
patients in highly rural areas and be pro-
vided to the Committees on Appropriations
of both Houses of Congress no later than 180
days after enactment of this Act.
Call Routing.—The Committees are still re-
ceiving reports that veterans calling their
community-based outpatient clinics (CBOC)
to make an appointment are sometimes
automatically routed to central call centers
at VA medical centers with no follow-up by
the local CBOCs after the initial call. The
fiscal year 2019 Conference Report included a
reporting requirement for VA to explain its
guidance on call routing of the scheduling of
appointments. The report that was sub-
mitted to the Committees failed to explain
VA guidance and was rather useless for ad-
dressing this issue. Therefore, the agreement
directs VA to provide a report that explains
the Department’s guidance on call routing of
the scheduling of appointments. The agree-
ment further directs VA to provide the Com-
mittees with an update on its call mod-
ernization efforts referenced in the March 20,
2019, Congressional Tracking Report on Call
Routing. This report shall be submitted to
the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress no later than 90 days
after enactment of this Act.
Long-Term Care
Long-Term Care.—The agreement provides
$9,781,721,000, as requested by the Depart-
ment for long-term care. This includes
$6,471,460,000 for institutional care and
$3,310,261,000 for non-institutional care. The
Committees are aware of the aging veteran
population and support long-term care that
focuses on facilitating veteran independence,
enhancing quality of life, and supporting the
family members of veterans. As such, the
agreement supports the Department’s efforts
to broaden veterans’ options regarding non-
institutional long-term care support and
services, and to accommodate veterans’ pref-
erences in receiving home-based services, as
well as community-based care, residential
settings, nursing homes, and other services.
The Committees acknowledge that the vet-
eran population faces unique health risks
and that each veteran requires an individual-
ized approach to care, and VA is encouraged
to continue cooperation with community,
State, and Federal partners to expand and
grow these programs.
Hospice Care.—As Vietnam-era veterans
age, many of them are facing unique end-of-
life challenges related to their combat expe-
rience that standard hospice care and pallia-
tive services are not fully equipped to ad-
dress. Public Law 115–244 urged VA to under-
take a pilot program to develop techniques,
best practices, and support mechanisms to
improve end-of-life care for combat veterans
and Vietnam-era veterans. Due to the lack of
meaningful advancement toward addressing
the unique needs of Vietnam veterans, the
agreement directs VA to carry out this pilot
program and to engage non-profit hospice
and palliative care providers with Vietnam
veteran-centric programs in implementing
the pilot program. The Committees are
aware that organizations such as the non-
profit, National Partnership for Hospice In-
novation, are developing programs designed
to meet the specific end-of-life care needs for
Vietnam-era veterans and strongly reiter-
ates that such an approach could be bene-
ficial to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria combat
veterans in the future. The agreement di-
rects the Department to submit a report on
this effort to the Committees on Appropria-
tions of both Houses of Congress no later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act.
Domiciliary Care Claims for Veterans with
Early-Stage Dementia.—Changes in VA’s proc-
essing and treatment of domiciliary care
claims has led to some veterans with early-
stage dementia who were earlier ruled eligi-
ble for VA domiciliary care to now be
deemed ineligible. The Department has
taken efforts to provide limited equitable re-
lief for current veteran patients previously
deemed eligible for domiciliary care. VA is
directed to provide a report to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress no later than 90 days after enact-
ment of this Act on the Department’s plan to
address care for all impacted veterans with
early-stage dementia.

Community Care, with $2,000,000,000 avail-
able until September 30, 2022. The agreement
provides an additional $4,521,400,000 above
the fiscal year 2020 advance appropriation for
the Medical Community Care account, of
which $615,000,000 shall be from unobligated
balances from the Veterans Choice Fund.
MEDICAL SUPPORT AND COMPLIANCE
The agreement provides $7,914,191,000 in ad-
vance for fiscal year 2021 for Medical Support
and Compliance and makes $150,000,000 of the
advance funding available through fiscal
year 2022. The agreement provides an addi-
tional $98,800,000 above the fiscal year 2020
advance appropriation for the Medical Sup-
port and Compliance account.
MEDICAL FACILITIES
The agreement provides $6,433,265,000 in ad-
vance for fiscal year 2021 for Medical Facili-
ties. Of the advance funding, $250,000,000 is
made available through fiscal year 2022.
The agreement provides $10,000,000 for
women’s health and mental health non-re-
curring maintenance (NRM) projects. Within
the mental health NRM projects, the agree-
ment directs VA to prioritize construction to
increase the number of beds available for
overnight mental health treatment for vet-
erans. The agreement further directs the De-
partment to submit an expenditure plan de-
tailing the planned use of funds, and to re-
port on specific measures it takes to track
and prioritize the physical and cultural
transformation within VA facilities to better
serve women veterans.
Community-Based Outpatient Clinic in Ba-
kersfield, California.—The latest delay in
building a clinic in Bakersfield, resulting
from the cancellation of Lease No.
36C10F18L3394 due to errors made by the De-
partment, is extremely concerning. On No-
vember 20, 2019, the Secretary provided a re-
vised timeline to build the new clinic, but fu-
ture protests may result in additional
delays. The agreement directs the Secretary
to expeditiously execute the proposed
timeline, including beginning site work as
soon as possible in 2020 and to provide
monthly reports to the Committees on Ap-
propriations of both Houses of Congress de-
tailing the Department’s assessment on
maintaining the timeline provided on No-
vember 20th, until the new clinic in Bakers-
field is activated.
Use of Smart Technologies.—The Depart-
ment is encouraged to work with industry
leaders on the use of smart technologies to
improve VA facilities.
War Related Illness and Injury Study Centers
(WRIISC).—In lieu of the direction provided
in House Report 116–63, the Committees di-
rect VA to conduct a feasibility study to es-
tablish a WRIISC focused on gender-based
differences in the development, diagnosis,
and treatment of exposure-related diseases.
VHA Infrastructure Planning and Facility
Assessments.—As VA implements the VA
MISSION Act and begins to make decisions
related to community capacity and the ap-
propriate size of VA’s footprint, the agree-
ment maintains that strong VHA facilities
are critical to a high-performing integrated
health network for veterans. Unfortunately,
despite significant investments from Con-
gress in recent years to address major and
minor construction and non-recurring main-
tenance, the Department’s execution of these
funds to upgrade or expand treatment facili-
ties for veterans has not moved as quickly as
intended. The agreement urges VA to look
for ways to be timelier in its execution of
dollars and more flexible in efforts to meet
the evolving healthcare needs of veterans.
The agreement directs the Department to
provide to the Committees on Appropria-
tions of both Houses of Congress a report on
the biggest impediments to executing con-
struction and leasing projects in a more effi-
cient and effective manner within 90 days of
enactment of this Act. The report should
also include an update on the market assess-
ment being conducted pursuant to the VA
MISSION Act.
Energy Savings.—The agreement encour-
ages VA to use energy-related Energy Sav-
ings Performance Contracting and Utility
Energy Service Contracting in concert with
appropriated funds to leverage more invest-
ment from the private sector for any VA ren-
ovation project for which energy systems are
involved.
Rate of Return on Alternative Energy Invest-
ments.—The Committees are concerned about
VA’s procurement of alternative energy and
the potential for the technology to be obso-
lete before full return on investment is
achieved. Therefore, the agreement encour-
ages the Secretary to assure that any new
alternative energy project has a return on
investment less than or equal to 10 years.
MEDICAL AND PROSTHETIC RESEARCH
The agreement provides $800,000,000 for
Medical and Prosthetic Research, available
until September 30, 2021. Bill language is in-
cluded to ensure that the Secretary allocates
adequate funding for prosthetic research spe-
cifically for female veterans and for toxic ex-
posures.
The Committees remain highly supportive
of this program and recognize its importance
both in improving healthcare services to vet-
erans and recruiting and retaining high qual-
ity medical professionals in the Veterans
Health Administration. The agreement en-
courages VA to continue its research into de-
veloping novel approaches to restoring vet-
erans with amputation, central nervous sys-
tem injuries, loss of sight or hearing, or
other physical and cognitive impairments to
full and productive lives.
Neural-Enabled Prosthetics.—The Commit-
tees understand the uniqueness of limb trau-
ma injuries sustained by servicemembers in
combat and support additional research in
this area. In lieu of the directive in House
Report 116–63, the agreement directs VA to
continue its efforts to fund and conduct re-
search that will design and develop tech-
nology to offset the effects of limb amputa-
tion, orthopedic injury and disease, neuro-
pathic pain, and other neurodegenerative
diseases by partnering with colleges and uni-
versities that specialize in these fields and
provide a report on the opportunities to ex-
pand this field of inquiry within 180 days of
enactment of this Act.
Cancer Moonshot.—The agreement supports
the Department’s efforts to utilize advances
in genomic science to provide targeted treat-
ment to veterans. The Department has iden-
tified prostate cancer, triple-negative breast
cancer, and colorectal cancer as areas of pri-
ority. Due to the prevalence of various skin
cancers among servicemembers, the agree-
ment directs that skin cancer be included as
well.
Enewetak Atoll Registry Research.—Thou-
sands of veterans served on the Enewetak
Atoll to clean up the island following its use
for nuclear weapons testing. There are many
instances of veterans who conducted the
cleanup suffering serious health problems,
such as brittle bones, cancers, and birth de-
fects in their children. The agreement urges
the Department to study whether there is a
connection between certain illnesses and the
potential exposure of individuals to radi-
ation related to service at Enewetak Atoll
between January 1, 1977, and December 31,
1980.
Rare Cancer Research.—The agreement en-
courages the Department to support research
to evaluate the health status of
servicemembers from their time of deploy-
ment to Iraq and Afghanistan over many
years to determine their incidence of chronic
diseases including cancers that tend not to
show up for decades. Furthermore, the De-
partment is encouraged to establish a col-
laboration with the Department of Defense
to examine the impact of rare cancers on
those who serve and fund research in deliv-
ering treatments for rare cancers that take a
platform-agnostic approach to developing
new therapeutics.
Gulf War Illness Studies.—The agreement
recommends that the Department continue
to conduct epidemiological studies regarding
the prevalence of Gulf War illness, mor-
bidity, and mortality in Persian Gulf War
veterans and the development of effective
treatments, preventions, and cures. The
agreement urges the Department to publish
disease-specific mortality data related spe-
cifically to Persian Gulf War veterans and
encourages the Department to utilize the
term, ‘‘Gulf War illness’’. The agreement
urges the Secretary to consider revising and
updating the Clinical Practice Guideline for
Chronic Multi-symptom Illness consistent
with the July 2011 Veterans Health Initia-
tive, ‘‘Caring for Gulf War Veterans,’’ and to
focus on recent Gulf War illness treatment
research findings and ongoing Gulf War ill-
ness treatment research direction. Further-
more, the agreement encourages VA to
strengthen the training of primary, spe-
cialty, and mental healthcare providers on
Gulf War illness.
VA/Department of Energy Computing Collabo-
ration.—The agreement supports ongoing re-
search between VA and the Department of
Energy’s National Laboratories.
Suicide Prevention.—VA is strongly encour-
aged to work with DOD’s Military Health
System to place high priority on the deploy-
ment of novel and innovative technologies to
prevent suicides and report in the fiscal year
2021 budget request on outcomes of the ef-
fort.
Longitudinal Study of Diagnostic Tools or
Biomarkers for Brain Conditions.—The agree-
ment encourages the Department to devise a
longitudinal study to identify and validate
two non-survey diagnostic tools or biomark-
ers for brain health conditions including TBI
and PTSD for clinical use at VA medical fa-
cilities by 2023, in coordination with the Na-
tional Research Action Plan. Additionally,
the agreement encourages VA to consider
the full range of brain health conditions, and
to seek the consultation of non-profit and
non-governmental research organizations
currently engaged in research for service-
member and veteran brain health conditions
for research collaboration, identification,
and validation. Reports on research shall be
made publicly available and submitted to
the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress no later than 60 days
after completion.
Rapid Cerebral Therapeutic Hypothermia.—
The agreement encourages the Department
to determine whether VA clinicians and phy-
sicians have the necessary equipment to rap-
idly administer cerebral therapeutic hypo-
thermia.
NATIONAL CEMETERY ADMINISTRATION
The agreement provides $329,000,000 for the
National Cemetery Administration (NCA). Of
the amount provided, not to exceed 10 per-
cent is available until September 30, 2021.
Committal Service Shelters.—The agreement
directs the Department to review the feasi-
bility and appropriateness of expanding com-
mittal shelters at State veteran cemeteries
to be able to accommodate at least 60 people
in comfort with a platform and sound system
for conducting services, private bathrooms,
and temperature control. The agreement fur-
ther directs the Department to provide a re-
port to the Committees on Appropriations of

National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific.—
Currently, the Pacific Region of the National
Cemetery Administration performs more an-
nual interments than any other region, but
has the fewest number of national ceme-
teries. In order to provide appropriate burial
space to veterans in the Pacific, the agree-
ment directs the Department to conduct a
feasibility review for the creation of a new
national cemetery in the Pacific region, and
to report the findings to the Committees on
Appropriations of both Houses of Congress
no later than 180 days after enactment of
this Act.
DEPARTMENTAL ADMINISTRATION
GENERAL ADMINISTRATION
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The agreement provides $355,911,000 for
General Administration. Of the amount pro-
vided, not to exceed 10 percent is available
for obligation until September 30, 2021. The
agreement continues to include bill language
permitting the transfer of funds from this
account to General Operating Expenses, Vet-
erans Benefits Administration.
Pro-Bono Legal Services.—The Committees
support the Department’s work with law
schools to assist veterans, which helps both
the students and veterans.
Lobbying Congress.—The agreement re-
minds the Department that lobbying Con-
gress in support of legislation imagined by
VA, and not at the request for technical as-
sistance from Congress, is not an appropriate
use of taxpayer resources. Further, the
agreement directs the Department to make
all central-office based employees of the Of-
fice of Public Affairs receive training on the
Hatch Act and its application to ensure offi-
cial Department resources are being used in
a nonpartisan manner.
The agreement provides funding for Gen-
eral Administration in the amounts specified
below:

Veterans Experience Office.—The agreement
provides that the Office continue to be fund-
ed through reimbursable agreements.
BOARD OF VETERANS APPEALS
The agreement provides $182,000,000 for the
Board of Veterans Appeals, of which not to
exceed 10 percent shall remain available
until September 30, 2021.
Appeals Process.—The agreement directs
the Board to develop a plan to address the
backlog of hearing requests, which includes
expanded remote access for rural veterans,
and to identify any necessary information
technology solutions. The agreement directs
the Board to provide this plan to the Com-
mittees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress no later than 180 days after enact-
ment of this Act.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The agreement provides $4,371,615,000 for
the Information Technology Systems ac-
count. This amount includes funding for sys-
tems supporting implementation of the Blue
Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act and other
anticipated needs. The agreement includes
$1,204,238,000 for staff salaries and expenses,
$2,739,597,000 for operation and maintenance
of existing programs, and $427,780,000 for pro-
gram development.
The agreement makes not to exceed 3 per-
cent of pay and associated costs funding
available until the end of fiscal year 2021; not
to exceed 5 percent of operations and mainte-
nance funding available until the end of fis-
cal year 2021 and all IT systems development
funding available until the end of fiscal year
2021.
The agreement continues language permit-
ting funding to be transferred among the
three IT subaccounts, subject to approval
from the Committees.
The agreement continues language pro-
viding that funding may be transferred
among development projects or to new
projects subject to the Committees’ ap-
proval.
The agreement continues language indi-
cating that no development project may be
increased or decreased by more than
$1,000,000 prior to receiving approval of the
Committees or a period of 30 days has
elapsed.
VA is dealing with an aging IT infrastruc-
ture and antiquated systems that have con-
tributed to issues affecting veterans, their
families, and third parties with whom VA
has agreements. Additionally, the Depart-
ment continues to identify significant IT
costs to support new and critical initiatives,
and to comply with requirements that have
been passed into law. The agreement pro-
vides an increase above the President’s re-
quest for IT and therefore assumes that the
Department will, within the allocation, be
able to secure an appropriate IT system for
the Office of Accountability and Whistle-
blower Protection to facilitate tracking and
reporting on data as required by law, and be
able to certify the system necessary to ex-
pand the Caregivers Program. Due to the
number of outdated legacy systems, the
agreement encourages the Department to
consider decommissioning systems that are
no longer in use and requires the Depart-
ment to provide notification to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress when such action is taken. The
agreement directs the Department to include
in future budget submissions an Information
Technology Decommissioning Report that
outlines what legacy systems will be decom-
missioned during the fiscal year.
Website Accessibility.—The agreement en-
courages the Department to review its infor-
mation technology systems to ensure com-
pliance with the law (29 U.S.C. 794), encom-
passing the Department’s websites, including
files attached to those websites, web-based
applications and kiosks at medical facilities.
No later than 180 days after enactment of
this Act, the agreement directs the Depart-
ment to report to the Committees on Appro-
priations of both Houses of Congress on the
findings of the review, as well as a plan to
become compliant with 29 U.S.C. 794.
This table is intended to serve as the De-
partment’s approved list of development
projects; any requested changes are subject
to reprogramming requirements.

VETERANS ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD
The agreement provides $1,500,000,000 for
Veterans Electronic Health Record for ac-
tivities related to the development and roll-
out of VA’s Electronic Health Record Mod-
ernization (EHRM) initiative, the associated
contractual costs, and the salaries and ex-
penses of employees hired under titles 5 and
38, United States Code.
EHRM Initiative.—The agreement includes
a substantial increase of $393,000,000 for the
EHRM initiative to provide benefits to vet-
erans and better management tools for the
Department. While the Committees remain
supportive of the EHRM initiative, as with
any acquisition of this size and magnitude,
there are implementation concerns, includ-
ing maintaining budget, scope, implementa-
tion and deployment schedules, security, re-
porting, and interoperability. As such, the
agreement directs the Secretary to continue
to provide quarterly reporting of obligations,
expenditures, and deployment implementa-
tion by facility. Moreover, the agreement di-
rects the Department to continue quarterly
briefings on performance milestones, costs,
and changes to implementation and manage-
ment plans. The bill maintains a provision
that prohibits obligation of funds incon-
sistent with deployment schedules provided
to the Committees on Appropriations.
Henceforth, the Secretary is directed to pro-
vide an accurate, up-to-date deployment
schedule at each quarterly briefing. The Sec-
retary is not provided transfer authority, as
requested, and is directed to continue using
this account as the sole source of funding
within the Department for EHRM. Further,
the agreement continues to direct the Sec-
retary to manage EHRM at the headquarters
level in the Office of the Deputy Secretary.

H11406 December 17, 2019
Government Accountability Office (GAO) Re-
view.—The agreement continues the fiscal
year 2019 directive to GAO to conduct quar-
terly performance reviews of EHRM deploy-
ment and to report to the Committees on
Appropriations each quarter.
VA/DOD Interoperability.—The need for a
fully functional, adaptable and interoperable
electronic health record system cannot be
understated, especially as VA shifts its
model of care to include the expanded use of
community providers. However, the Depart-
ment and DOD do not appear to be placing
sufficient priority and urgency on this mat-
ter. As such, VA and DOD are directed to ex-
peditiously utilize the joint Federal Elec-
tronic Health Record Modernization Pro-
gram Office to establish clear and agreed-
upon metrics and goals for interoperability,
as well as timeframes for meeting these
goals. The Federal Electronic Health Record
Modernization Program Office is directed to
incorporate metrics, goals, and timeframes
in the joint office’s charter and to provide
the charter to the Committees on Appropria-
tions of both Houses of Congress within 30
days of enactment of this Act. The Secretary
is directed to provide updates from the joint
office, including any plans to alter its char-
ter or processes, in the quarterly reports and
briefings provided to the Committees on Ap-
propriations.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
The agreement provides $210,000,000 for the
Office of Inspector General, which is
$3,000,000 above the request. Of the amount
provided, not to exceed 10 percent is avail-
able for obligation until September 30, 2021.
The additional funds are provided to ensure
robust oversight regarding implementation
of the VA MISSION Act and the Electronic
Health Record Modernization initiative.
The Inspector General is strongly encour-
aged to undertake and complete investiga-
tions in a timely manner and share informa-
tion with the Department, the Department
of Justice, and other entities as appropriate.
Washington DC Veterans Affairs Medical
Center.—The agreement urges the Inspector
General to dedicate all necessary resources
to provide rigorous oversight of the Wash-
ington DC Veterans Affairs Medical Center, a
facility that has been plagued with manage-
ment problems.
CONSTRUCTION, MAJOR PROJECTS
The agreement provides $1,235,200,000 for
Construction, Major Projects. The agree-
ment makes this funding available for five
years, except that $198,600,000 is made avail-
able until expended, of which $35,000,000 shall
be available for seismic improvement
projects.
Challenges in Executing Construction
Projects.—The Committees are concerned by
VA’s inability to execute appropriated con-
struction dollars in a timely manner. Based
on its annual Strategic Capital Investment
Planning process, VA’s capital needs over
the next 10 years may require resources up to
$72,000,000,000 to address. However, VA has
been challenged to execute even a small frac-
tion of that amount in a given fiscal year.
Therefore, the agreement directs VA to pro-
vide within 240 days of enactment of this Act
a written report outlining VA’s short- and
long-term plans to expand and strengthen its
internal and contract capacity to execute its
construction budget across major, minor,
non-recurring maintenance, and leasing
projects efficiently and effectively. This re-
port should provide a holistic, VA-wide stra-
tegic plan incorporating the needs of VHA,
the Office of Acquisition, Logistics & Con-
struction, the Office of Management, and
other relevant VA administrations/offices, to
address the issue, including long-term staff-
ing needs, the cost of any temporary spaces,
any legislative and organizational changes,
and requirements to improve and streamline.
The report should also look at the accuracy
of cost estimates used for planning construc-
tion and leasing projects, the impact of un-
derestimating costs on project timeframes,
and any actions that can be taken to im-
prove the accuracy of estimates of future
projects to ensure timely execution.
Communities Helping Invest through Property
and Improvements Needed for Veterans Pilot.—
The agreement encourages the Department
to utilize the authority granted by the Com-
munities Helping Invest through Property
and Improvements Needed for Veterans Act
of 2016 (Public Law 114–294) to fulfill the Con-
gressional intent and initiate additional
projects. Additionally, the Committees be-
lieve that the Department should prioritize
projects that result in a public-private part-
nership between VA and a non-Federal enti-
ty. In doing so, the agreement strongly en-
courages the Department to look at projects
that would avoid VA duplicating services,
and rather address gaps in necessary services
for veterans.

RELATED AGENCIES
AMERICAN BATTLE MONUMENTS COMMISSION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement provides $84,100,000 for Sal-
aries and Expenses of the American Battle
Monuments Commission (ABMC), an in-
crease of $9,000,000 above the budget request
to support ABMC’s unfunded requirements
for high-priority projects and address the
maintenance backlog at existing monuments
and cemeteries. The additional funds are pro-
vided to accelerate the Commission’s five-
year plan, not only to maintain the ceme-
teries and monuments honoring America’s
war dead, but also to preserve and commu-
nicate these veterans’ stories of courage and
sacrifice.
American Battle Monuments Commission.—On
October 22, 2018, ABMC submitted a plan to
spend $28,900,000 in additional funding that
Congress appropriated in fiscal year 2019 to
support ABMC’s unfunded cemetery require-
ments. ABMC’s plan includes $20,400,000 for
the Honolulu interpretive center at the Na-
tional Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific,
known as the ‘‘Punchbowl.’’ The National
Cemetery Administration (NCA) has identi-
fied a site for the interpretive center adja-

ABMC is directed, in conjunction with NCA,
to execute the funding appropriated for
projects identified in its October 2018 spend
plan to Congress and to complete the pro-
posed siting and construction feasibility
evaluation at the administrative facility-ad-
jacent location to ensure the interpretive
center remains in balance with the long-
term mission and legacy of the Punchbowl.

CEMETERIAL EXPENSES, ARMY
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement provides $80,800,000 for
Cemeterial Expenses, Army.—Salaries and
Expenses. This amount is equal to the fiscal
year 2019 enacted level and $10,000,000 above
the budget request. Within that amount, up
to $15,000,000 in funding is available until
September 30, 2022.
The budget request for Arlington National
Cemetery’s operating account has been held
artificially flat for a number of years, and
this action is having a deleterious effect on
the Cemetery’s performance and ability to
meet its mission. It is unacceptable that the
Cemetery’s budget requests are continually
inadequate to maintain the current level of
services. The Cemetery cannot be under-
resourced, and accordingly, the bill provides
an additional $10,000,000 to correct this defi-
ciency.
This agreement reflects unwavering sup-
port for the Cemetery and the successful
completion of the Cemetery’s truly unique
and honored mission. Accordingly, the Sec-
retary of the Army is again directed to in-
clude this increase in the Cemetery’s base-
line budget and ensure future budget re-
quests provide ample resources for the Ceme-
tery, including funding to complete the
planned Southern Expansion and ensure that
the life of our Nation’s most prestigious
cemetery is extended into the 2050 time-
frame.
ARMED FORCES RETIREMENT HOME
TRUST FUND
The agreement provides a total of
$75,300,000 for the Armed Forces Retirement
Home (AFRH), an increase of $11,000,000
above the fiscal year 2019 enacted level and
the budget request. The increase is intended
to support high-priority capital projects.
AFRH–W Development.—The Committees
recognize the critical role of AFRH in pro-
viding residences and related services for
certain retired and former members of the
Armed Forces and support AFRH’s efforts to
lease 80 acres of underutilized land on its
Washington, D.C., campus. AFRH is directed
to submit quarterly reports to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress outlining the redevelopment
progress against the AFRH–W Master Plan,
including the status of the lease negotiations
and the financial transparency of the devel-
opment project.

H11426 December 17, 2019
DIVISION G—DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
FOREIGN OPERATIONS, AND RELATED
PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2020
In implementing this agreement, Federal
departments, agencies, commissions, and
other entities are directed to comply with
the directives, reporting requirements, and
instructions contained in H. Rept. 116–78
(House report) accompanying H.R. 2839 and
incorporated by reference by section 7066 in
division D of H.R. 2740 (House bill) and S.
Rept. 116–126 (Senate report) accompanying
S. 2583 (Senate bill) as though stated in this
explanatory statement, unless specifically
directed to the contrary.
This explanatory statement, while repeat-
ing some House and Senate report language
for emphasis or clarification, does not ne-
gate language in such reports unless ex-
pressly provided herein. Language expressing
an opinion or making an observation in the
House or Senate reports represents the view
of the respective committee unless specifi-
cally endorsed in this explanatory state-
ment. In cases in which the House and Sen-
ate reports provide contradictory directives
or instructions that are not addressed in this
explanatory statement, such directives or in-
structions are negated.
Reports required to be submitted pursuant
to the Act, including reports required by this
explanatory statement and the House and
Senate reports, may not be consolidated to
include responses to multiple requirements
in a single report, except following consulta-
tion with the Committees on Appropriations.
In lieu of the tables and allocations of
funding contained in the House and Senate
reports, the tables and allocations contained
in this explanatory statement shall guide de-
partments, agencies, commissions, and other
entities when allocating funds.
Section 7019 of the Act requires that
amounts designated in the respective tables
included in this explanatory statement for
funds appropriated in titles III through V,
including tables in title VII, shall be made
available at not less than such designated
amounts, unless otherwise provided for in
the Act, and shall be the basis of the report
required by section 653(a) of the Foreign As-
sistance Act (FAA) of 1961, where applicable.
The Act provides that the amounts des-
ignated in the tables shall be made available
notwithstanding the date of the trans-
mission of such report. Section 7019 also in-
cludes limited authority to deviate not more
than 10 percent below such designated
amounts and continues language similar to
prior fiscal years including certain excep-
tions to the requirements of the section.
Proposed deviations from tables in titles I
and II in this explanatory statement are sub-
ject to the regular notification procedures of
the Committees on Appropriations, unless an
exception or deviation authority is specifi-
cally provided herein.
For purposes of this explanatory state-
ment, the term ‘‘prior Acts’’ means prior
Acts making appropriations for the Depart-
ment of State, foreign operations, and re-
lated programs. In addition, ‘‘division F of
Public Law 116–6’’, means the Department of
State, Foreign Operations, and Related Pro-
grams Appropriations Act, 2019.
For purposes of the Act and this explana-
tory statement, the term ‘‘regular notifica-
tion procedures of the Committees on Appro-
priations’’ means such Committees are noti-
fied not less than 15 days in advance of the
obligation of funds. The Secretary of State
and United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) Administrator are di-
rected to submit notifications for the obliga-
tion of funds made available by the Act and
prior Acts not later than 90 days prior to the
expiration of such funds.
Congressional notifications submitted by
the heads of the relevant Federal agencies
contained in the Act for funds that are being
reallocated prior to initial obligation, repro-
grammed, or reobligated after deobligation,
shall, to the maximum extent practicable,
contain detailed information about the
sources of the funds and why such funds are
no longer needed or intended to be used as
previously justified.
For purposes of the Act and this explana-
tory statement, the term ‘‘prior consulta-
tion’’ means a pre-decisional engagement be-
tween a relevant Federal agency and the
Committees on Appropriations during which
the Committees are provided a meaningful
opportunity to provide facts and opinions to
inform: (1) the use of funds; (2) the develop-
ment, content, or conduct of a program or
activity; or (3) a decision to be taken. Direc-
tion to consult with the ‘‘Committee’’ in ei-
ther the House or Senate reports shall mean
to consult with the Committees on Appro-
priations.
Notwithstanding authority included in any
provision of the Act shall not be construed
to exclude the requirements of such provi-
sion.
In the Act, the term ‘‘stabilization assist-
ance’’ has the same meaning as defined by
the Stabilization Assistance Review in ‘‘A
Framework for Maximizing the Effectiveness
of U.S. Government Efforts to Stabilize Con-
flict-Affected Areas, 2018.’’
Similar to prior fiscal years, funding is
made available and designated as Overseas
Contingency Operations/Global War on Ter-
rorism (OCO/GWOT) pursuant to the Bal-
anced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control
Act of 1985 (BBEDCA) in the Act. Such funds
are intended to address the extraordinary
costs of operations and assistance in coun-
tries in conflict and areas of instability and
violence, particularly for security, stabiliza-
tion, and peacekeeping programs; humani-
tarian activities; and counterterrorism and
counterinsurgency efforts. The Act does not
contain or establish a regional limitation on
use of OCO/GWOT.
The Secretary of State shall comply with
the directive under section 7015 in the House
report regarding the transfer or release of
any individuals detained at Naval Station,
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in the manner de-
scribed.
The agreement maintains the traditional
uses and placement in title III for the Devel-
opment Assistance and Economic Support
Fund accounts.
The Director of the Peace Corps shall in-
form the Secretary of State prior to opening,
closing, significantly reducing, or sus-
pending an overseas office or country pro-
gram, which will help strengthen commu-
nication and coordination of United States
policy overseas.
Not later than 60 days after the release of
any foreign assistance review or realignment
prepared or conducted by the National Secu-
rity Council, Office of Management and
Budget, Department of State, or USAID, or
any combination thereof, the Comptroller
General of the United States shall provide an
assessment of such review or realignment to
the appropriate congressional committees,
including an analysis of the methodology
used to determine any recommendations in-
cluded in such foreign assistance review or
realignment. Each assessment shall be sub-
mitted in unclassified form but may include
a classified annex.
The agreement directs the Department of
State to fully restore $40,026,539 in Economic
Support Fund that lapsed at the end of fiscal
year 2019 due to apportionment and obliga-
tion delays, including $35,379,246 for the Bu-
reau of Democracy, Human Rights, and
Labor (DRL). Such programs shall be funded
at not less than the previously planned lev-
els and are in addition to any amounts iden-
tified for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 programs.

Unless otherwise noted, the language and

the 2020 appropriations agreement. This
statement, while repeating some report lan-
guage for emphasis, does not intend to ne-

Reviews and Recommendations.—The FAA’s
organization, processes, and policies are un-
dergoing a thorough review as the result of
two recent fatal aviation accidents. The Na-
tional Transportation Safety Board (NTSB),
the Joint Authorities Technical Review
Panel (JATR), and the Indonesian National
Transportation Safety Committee have each
issued recommendations. Additional rec-
ommendations are anticipated from the Of-
fice of Inspector General (OIG); DOT’s Spe-
cial Committee to Review FAA’s Aircraft
Certification Process; the Safety Oversight
and Certification Advisory Committee; the
House Committee on Transportation and In-
frastructure; the Senate Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation; the
Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority; and a
multidisciplinary expert review panel on Or-
ganization Designation Authorization (ODA)
programs, processes, and procedures; among
others. The agreement directs the FAA to re-
spond to each recommendation and to report
to the House and Senate Committees on Ap-
propriations on the impact of these rec-
ommendations on its resource and funding
needs. The agreement further directs the
FAA to resolve an open recommendation
from a 2015 OIG report regarding evaluation
criteria and tools used to target safety over-
sight. The FAA is strongly reminded that
changes to its organizational structure are
subject to the requirements of section 405 of
this Act.
Aviation Safety Staffing and Training.—The
agreement includes $6,800,000 throughout
aviation safety (AVS) for the salaries and ex-
penses of additional staff with expertise in
human factors, systems safety engineering,
software engineering, manufacturing and in-
dustrial engineering, data analytics and
science, and international aviation safety
standards. The FAA is also directed to stra-
tegically use its existing personnel authori-
ties to recruit and retain staff in these occu-
pations, including student loan repayment
and tuition repayment programs, direct hire
authority, recruitment and relocation incen-
tives, and the use of programs such as the
minority serving institutions internship and
pathways programs. The agreement also in-
cludes $6,200,000 to cover the cost of tech-
nical training and credentialing related to
flight operations, aircraft certification, engi-
neering, human factors, and other technical
specialties that would support the aviation
safety mission. The FAA shall brief the
House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions no later than 90 days after enactment
on its use of these authorities in order to
meet staffing and technical skills targets
and potential uses for competitive com-
pensation and recalibration of qualification
standards.
Improving Aviation Safety.—The agreement
includes up to $3,000,000 for the FAA, in con-
sultation with the Department of State and
USAID, to help organizations around the
world understand U.S. safety standards, pro-
vide technical training for civil aviation au-
thorities and foreign air carriers, and assist
civil aviation authorities safely integrate
U.S.-manufactured aircraft into their regu-
latory framework. An additional $1,000,000
may be used, in consultation with the De-
partment of State and USAID, to create op-
portunities for the FAA to engage with lead-
ers around the world through outreach and
training programs for aviation stakeholders,
consistent with the FAA Reauthorization
Act of 2018 requirement to promote U.S.
aerospace safety standards.
Centralized Safety Guidance Database.—The
FAA is directed to report on its progress in
implementing the centralized safety guid-
ance database by May 1, 2020, including a
specific timetable for full implementation.

directs the FAA to report on unfinished
rulemakings related to the safety of foreign
repair stations and flight attendant rest re-
quirements 30 days after enactment of this
Act.
Workforce Diversity.—Of the amount pro-
vided for staff offices, the agreement in-
cludes up to $5,000,000, but not less than
$3,500,000, for the minority serving institu-
tions (MSI) internship program for the cost
of the stipend, travel, orientations, work-
shops, field trips, mentoring, coaching, pro-
gram administration, and program evalua-
tion. The agreement further requires the
FAA to incorporate the MSI internship pro-
gram into the FAA–United States Air Force
aviation workforce initiative announced on
May 31, 2019.
Pilot Medical Certification.—The agreement
does not require the FAA to report on the
data related to special issuance medical cer-
tificates for insulin dependency as required
by the Senate report, but does direct the
FAA to submit the report required by the
House report.

tion Pilot Program (IPP).—The agreement re-
quires the FAA to provide the report on UAS
IPP, as required by the Senate report, no
later than March 2, 2020.
Veteran’s pilot training grants program.—The
agreement directs the FAA to use up to
$5,000,000 for competitive grants to facilitate
the future supply of adequate pilots as re-
quired in the Senate report, and in awarding
such grants the FAA is encouraged to
prioritize flight schools that are either ac-
credited by the Department of Education or
hold a restricted airline transport pilot let-
ter of authorization.
Opioid Antagonists.—As part of the ongoing
efforts to review regulations regarding the
emergency medical equipment carried by
passenger airlines, the FAA should take
timely action to issue additional guidance to
air carriers to ensure the inclusion of opioid
antagonists in emergency medical kits.
FAA Reauthorization.—The agreement di-
rects the FAA to submit a report to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions on March 2, 2020, and on September 8,
2020, on the status of implementation of the
provisions in P.L. 115–254, including a list of
all mandates and associated deadlines, the
