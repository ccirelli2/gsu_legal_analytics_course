TRUMP SHUTDOWN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. HOYER) for 5 minutes.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, this week-
end, the Republican leader, Mr. MCCAR-
THY, went on ‘‘Face the Nation’’ and
said the following: ‘‘It is unacceptable
that 800,000 U.S. employees are not
being paid.’’ He didn’t add, but he
should have, that 440,000 of them are
being made to work while they are not
paid.
But I agree that it is unacceptable
that 800,000 U.S. folks are shut out. It
is unacceptable that Republicans and
Donald Trump would shut down the
government and deny paychecks to
800,000 Americans because they
couldn’t get congressional approval for
an expensive and ineffective border
wall, even when they controlled all le-
vers of government.
Let me repeat that. They didn’t get
it done when they controlled all levers
of government.
The Republican leader went on to
say: ‘‘You know what we’re arguing
over? One-tenth of 1 percent of the Fed-
eral budget.’’
He is dead wrong on that. This isn’t
about a wall, or healthcare, or the debt
limit, or spending levels. It is about
whether it is appropriate policy for a
President to threaten shutdowns and
take the country hostage to get what
he wants.
It is malfeasant and malevolent to
hold 800,000 Americans and, indeed, the
millions they serve hostage to the de-
mands of a President who, days before
he shut down the government, told us
that is exactly what he intended to do.
That is why House Democrats, joined
by several Republicans, passed six of
the seven remaining appropriations
bills for fiscal year 2019, all of which
had bipartisan support in the Senate,
and a continuing resolution to reopen
the Department of Homeland Security
on the first day of the new Congress.
It is also why, last week, House
Democrats passed, on an individual
basis, four of those same appropria-
tions bills to reopen portions of govern-
ment that the Senate approved by a
vote of 92–6, over 90 percent, almost 95
percent of the Senators.
Our colleague from Oklahoma (Mr.
COLE) was concerned that these were
not products of the House. He is right.
So vote to open up a government with
a CR, which you will have an oppor-
tunity to do three times, my Repub-
lican colleagues. Let’s conclude the ap-
propriations process by passing bills
agreed upon by the House and the Sen-
ate.
What we have been saying all along
is: Reopen the people’s government.
Shutting it down is an illegitimate, im-
moral act.
I disagree with the Republican lead-
er’s characterization of Democrats’ po-
sition as taking a stand for a certain
level of funding.
Just give us X amount of money for
a wall, Republicans and the President
say, and the shutdown will end.
This is not about a wall. It is about
trying to gain an end by threat, rather
than by democratic debate. One side
cannot, must not, continue to threaten
shutdowns to get its way in a democ-
racy.
Our research does not show us an-
other democracy in the world that
shuts itself down. That is not how the
system should work.
If Donald Trump is permitted to
bully the American people and their
representatives into giving him what-
ever he wants, does anyone think, for a
second, we won’t be right back here in
a few weeks, or a few months, with yet
another shutdown over the next item
on the President’s wish list?
Give me more tax cuts for the
wealthy, or I will shut down the gov-
ernment, he will say. Cut Medicare and
Social Security, or I will default on the
debt.
This is about more than money to
build a wall on our border. It is about
whether to firm up the wall around our
democracy.
We need to end this shutdown now,
reopen the government first, and dis-
cuss, rationally, how best to secure our
borders, an objective many of us have
voted to do over the years, with sub-
stantial increases in our investment in
security at all of our borders.
The only beneficiaries, very frankly,
of this shutdown are Russia, China,
Iran, and our other enemies and those
who would like to see us fail. If this

shutdown continues, it will further
weaken us on trade, on national secu-
rity, on protecting our interests
around the world, and in serving our
people here at home. And it will con-
tinue harming our economy, which has
already lost nearly as much in GDP as
the President wants for his wall.
Mr. Speaker, if Leader MCCARTHY
truly finds it unacceptable for this
shutdown to continue, I ask him and
all my Republican colleagues to join us
in urging Senator MCCONNELL, who has
called shutdowns ‘‘failed policy,’’ and
President Trump to end it by taking up
the bills the House has already passed
to do so.
Mr. President, open our government
for the people.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
OPIOID EPIDEMIC IS PUBLIC
HEALTH CRISIS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, on Sunday, I had the
privilege of being in Kane, Pennsyl-
vania, McKean County, Pennsylvania’s
15th Congressional District, for a film
screening and a panel discussion about
opioid addiction.
The 11-minute film is called ‘‘Eye of
the Needle,’’ and it chronicles opioid
addiction in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
It was produced in 2017 for the Light of
Life Rescue Mission’s annual gala.
Light of Life is a homeless shelter in
Pittsburgh whose clients are homeless,
primarily due to addiction and mental
health issues. Light of Life provides a
home for the homeless; food for the
hungry; and care for the poor, the ad-
dicted, the abused, and the elderly.
Like so many shelters in America,
the opioid epidemic has greatly im-
pacted them. They have been using this
film as an educational tool. It has been
screened at Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity, Duquesne University, Point Park
University, and Robert Morris Univer-
sity.
On Sunday, it was the first time the
film was shown in a community set-
ting. About 100 people gathered in the
Kane Area Community Center for the
viewing, which also featured a panel
discussion.
I proudly participated on the panel,
which featured several speakers from
the community, including representa-
tives from law enforcement and alcohol
and drug abuse services.
Mr. Speaker, I know there isn’t a ZIP
Code in the country that isn’t im-
pacted by the opioid epidemic. We have
seen the crippling effects of this epi-
demic, and we need to act with unified
urgency to help those who are suf-
fering.
It is considered by many to be the
worst public health crisis of this gen-
eration. Overcoming it will not only
take a community-wide effort, but a
nationwide effort.
Through treatment and recovery,
through prevention, by protecting our
communities, and by fighting fentanyl
and other ever-changing synthetic or
foreign illicit drugs, we will overcome
this epidemic.
Heroin and pain pill addiction does
not discriminate on age, race, gender,
or socioeconomic status. Your neighbor
could be using heroin, and so could
their high-honors high school student.
Unfortunately, the people of Pennsyl-
vania have seen some of the worst. In
2017, the crisis surged when the Com-
monwealth experienced a 44 percent in-
crease in opioid overdoses.
Addressing this unprecedented rate
of opioid-related deaths means that we
must focus on nearly 2.2 million Ameri-
cans who currently struggle with
opioid addiction.
In the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania, we are on the front line.
Through community conversations,
like the one that took place in Kane
this Sunday, we can continue the con-
versation on how to end this epidemic.
Congress has engaged many agencies,
including the Department of Justice,
the Drug Enforcement Administration,
the National Institutes of Health, the
Centers for Disease Control, and Cus-
toms and Border Protection, just to
name a few, to help combat opioid
abuse.
This crisis has taken lives, torn apart
families, weakened our workforce, and
overextended our healthcare system.
Mr. Speaker, this is a modern-day
plague and the public health crisis of
our lifetime. We need to talk about it.
We need to take action. And we need to
find solutions.
f
LET’S HAVE SMART BORDER
SECURITY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) for 5 minutes.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the
President has really made his wall ar-
gument on the basis of stopping illegal
drugs from coming into the country.
Last week, I talked about the Magi-
not Line in France, an impenetrable
defense. The Germans went around it.
If drugs were being smuggled across
the desert, another section of wall isn’t
going to stop them. They will go
around it. But that is not the way
drugs are coming into the United
States of America. They are coming
through our legal border crossings. I
talked about that last week.
We need more personnel. We need
more technology there to inspect a
larger number of the vehicles, all the
vehicles coming across, with high tech-
nology, to find the human smuggling,
the drug smuggling, and the weapons
smuggling that is coming in that way.
But there is another way that drugs
are pouring into the United States of
America, and here is, last year, just
one of the incidents that the Coast
Guard intercepted. They intercepted
$5.6 billion of illegal drugs being smug-
gled in through maritime pathways.
The recently retired commandant
said that is only about 20 percent of
the shipments. We could intercept
more if we had more personnel. If we
had more and modern helicopters, if we
had more fast-pursuit boats, we could
stop a much larger percentage.
But today is a really special day.
These brave men and women of the
United States Coast Guard will miss
their paychecks today, the first time
that I know of in recent history that
members of the uniformed military are
not being paid by their government.
41,000 Active Duty coasties won’t be
paid. And guess what? The first of next
month, 50,000 retired coasties won’t be
paid. In addition to that, there are 8,000
Coast Guard critical civilian employees
who are not being paid.
So if the President really wants to
talk about intercepting drugs, and he
wants to talk about real border secu-
rity, he should be talking about giving
more resources to the United States
Coast Guard, not stiffing them on their
paychecks and not making them fly
ancient helicopters and 50-year-old cut-
ters.
But he wants to waste $5 billion on a
wall across part of the desert that you
can go around, if that is the way they
were smuggling in drugs. But as I said
earlier, they aren’t.
Let’s have smart border security.
Let’s use our precious tax dollars in an
intelligent, 21st century way, not a
vanity wall.

HONORING THE SERVICE AND SAC-
RIFICE OF PFC GARFIELD M.
LANGHORN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
New York (Mr. ZELDIN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, today, I
rise to honor the service and sacrifice
of hometown hero and Medal of Honor
recipient PFC Garfield M. Langhorn
from Riverhead, New York, who, 50
years ago today, saved the lives of his
platoon members, at just 20 years old,
by throwing himself on a live grenade
in Pleiku province in Vietnam on Jan-
uary 15, 1969.
PFC Langhorn served as a radio oper-
ator with Troop C, 7th Squadron, 17th
Cavalry Regiment, 1st Aviation Bri-
gade, when his unit attempted to res-
cue the crew of a downed American hel-
icopter. Finding no surviving crew,
PFC Langhorn and his unit were re-
turning the fallen aviators when they
came under heavy fire from North Vi-
etnamese forces.
Under the cover of darkness, the
North Vietnamese began to advance,
throwing a hand grenade in front of
PFC Langhorn, who threw himself on
the grenade. The grenade was just a
few feet from a few of his injured com-
rades.

It was in that moment, PFC
Langhorn was so selfless, he chose a
courageous act that President Lincoln
once referred to as ‘‘the last full meas-
ure of devotion.’’ It was an act for his
brothers, his fellow soldiers, and his
country. In that moment, he
‘‘unhesitatingly threw himself on the
grenade, scooped it beneath his body
and absorbed the blast,’’ according to
the Medal of Honor Citation and the
firsthand accounts of his fellow sol-
diers he saved.
For his extraordinary act of bravery,
PFC Langhorn received a series of
awards, including the highest, most
prestigious personal military declara-
tion, the Medal of Honor. Most re-
cently, the Riverhead Post Office was
named in his honor. There is no doubt
PFC Langhorn has earned these com-
mendations, but they mean little if we
forget to look beyond the declarations
and forever remember and honor the
actions of the 20-year-old man who
earned them.
In saving his fellow soldiers, PFC
Langhorn’s life was extinguished too
soon, but as President Lincoln contin-
ued, ‘‘we here highly resolve that these
dead shall not have died in vain.’’
Today, we must challenge ourselves
as Americans to pick up that torch, to
embody the bravery, selflessness, and
commitment to our great country.
There is no memorial, no medal, and no
post office that can bring back PFC
Langhorn, but he can live eternally in
all of us, in our actions and in our
hearts.
f
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
MCGOVERN). The Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH)
for 5 minutes.
Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I want to
read part of a letter from Charles from
Vermont:
I am a Marine Corps veteran and have
spent the last 15 years guarding the national
borders as a CPB officer. The government
shutdown is unacceptable. January in
Vermont is pretty cold. As a furloughed gov-
ernment worker, I have to choose whether to
pay for fuel oil to heat my home or to make
child support payments to support my ex-
wife and my children. And without work and
without pay, I am unable to do that.
He is one of 1,300 Vermont employees
of the Federal Government who is
working without pay. These include 900
employees at the Department of Home-
land Security, 300 employees at the De-
partment of Agriculture, and 100 em-
ployees of the Interior Department.
Mr. Speaker, this Sunday, I went to
the shift change at the Burlington
International Airport and met with our
TSA personnel. They asked me a ques-
tion. They had missed a paycheck.
They had been showing up for work
every single day. They had been doing,
in their professional and cheerful way,
processing all of us through security,
keeping us safe, and they are very
proud of their work. But they asked me
a question that I couldn’t answer: Do
you know of any other situation where
an employer can require a person to
work even when the employer has told
that employee you are not getting
paid?
That is what is happening. That hap-
pens nowhere. Where in your experi-
ence can an employer, whatever kind,
tell the worker to show up, but we are
not going to pay you?
That is what is going on, and it is
having a ripple effect throughout our
economy. It is the Federal workers, but
it is also everyday citizens who depend
on routine functioning of government
in order to meet their obligations.
Let me read a letter from Karle, a
small business owner from the North-
east Kingdom. He talks about how this
government shutdown has affected his
business.
As the owner of Kingdom Construction, we
employ nearly 30 full-time, year-round con-
struction workers.
They were recently awarded a $2 mil-
lion construction contract, but they
can’t get the permits signed because
the permit signers are on furlough.
Those folks are not going to work.
That is real and unacceptable and inev-
itable when we have this government
shutdown.
Now, every one of us has these sto-
ries, whether it is somebody who has a
microbrewery and can’t get the FDA
inspection, it is that construction com-
pany where they can’t get the sign-off
on the permit, or it is a closing that
can’t occur because the paperwork
won’t be signed. This is going on, cost-
ing our economy about a billion dollars
a week, and it is all because we are
having this dispute that is quite resolv-
able.
Now, Mr. Speaker, the issue of border
security is incredibly important and we
all know that, but at the eleventh
hour, because we have a dispute about
one element of it, is that a reason to
shut down the government, when not
only does it do collateral damage to
lots of innocent people, but it makes it
more difficult for us to resolve the un-
derlying issue about border security?
Mr. Speaker, my suggestion is it is
time for us to have a cooling-off period.
Turn the lights back on in government.
We can have a temporary, short-term
extension of the Homeland Security
bill, get people paid, and then convene
all of the relevant parties to have a ne-
gotiation about border security and
about all of our immigration policies,
including the Dreamers, including un-
documented workers, and including the
challenge we have about legal immi-
gration and having people who can
come here vetted to our country and
contribute to our economy.
There is a price that is paid by indi-
vidual workers not getting a paycheck;
there is a price that is paid by individ-
uals who are not getting the func-
tioning of government; but there is
also a price that we are paying in the
trust that is required to sustain a de-
mocracy.
We have to make off-limits the tactic
of shutting down government in order
to get your way. Our democracy de-
pends on mutual trust; it depends on
accepting certain norms that, as vig-
orous as we will be in advocating our
point of view, we will not cause collat-
eral damage to others to get our way.

RECOGNIZING CORPORAL KEVIN
MCCLOSKEY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5
minutes.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker,
this weekend, I was proud to stand
with our community and join Homes
For Our Troops as a new house for an
American hero was unveiled. On Satur-
day morning, Kevin McCloskey and his
wife, Bridget, received the keys to
their new home in Upper South Hamp-
ton in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.
On June 8, 2008, Corporal McCloskey
was severely injured in Afghanistan
after his vehicle struck an IED. He suf-
fered critical injuries to both his legs
and vision in his right eye, and he suf-
fered severe burns and traumatic brain
injury.
While Kevin has made significant
progress in his recovery, everyday ac-
tivities can still be challenging. The
McCloskeys’ new home is retrofitted to
make these tasks easier and more ac-
cessible for Kevin and Bridget.
Mr. Speaker, Kevin is a true patriot
and an American hero. We thank him
for his service, and we wish him and
Bridget all the best in their new home.
We are so proud to have them join our
Bucks County family.
I would also like to thank Homes For
Our Troops and their entire board for
honoring those who sacrifice for our
freedom.
RECOGNIZING PINEVILLE TAVERN
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize a small business
in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that
has gone out of their way to help Fed-
eral employees who are not being paid
due to this prolonged government shut-
down.
For the duration of the government
shutdown, Pineville Tavern has offered
furloughed workers and their imme-
diate family their popular pickle-
brined chicken at no cost. At this time
of so much unneeded uncertainty for
our Federal workers, the charity of
Pineville Tavern is deeply appreciated
by our community.
Pineville Tavern chef Drew Abruzzese
says it best when he calls the current
impasse ‘‘a political game of chicken.’’
Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues
to put aside our differences, fund our
government, and get our Federal em-
ployees back to work.
I am grateful for Drew’s generosity
and leadership, along with his father
and the owner of Pineville Tavern, An-
drew Abruzzese. Their dedication to
our community is deeply appreciated.

HONORING ED BURNS
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to honor the life and mem-
ory of a Bucks County icon who passed
away on January 10 at the age of 87. Ed
Burns embodied public service
throughout his entire life and his sto-
ried career.
A Navy veteran, Ed became a teacher
after graduating from La Salle College
and Temple University. He later served
as the head of the Bensalem Recreation
Department and served on the school
board.
In 1972, Ed entered State govern-
ment, serving as a State representative
for the 18th District for nearly 20 years.
Notably, Ed later became the first
mayor of Bensalem, serving honorably
from 1990 to 1994.
We would like to extend our heartfelt
condolences to Ed’s wife, Joan; his son,
Joseph F. Burns; and his two beautiful
grandchildren.
Ed’s legacy of public service to
Bensalem and to Bucks County has left
an indelible mark on our community,
one that will last for generations.
f
ANTI-SEMITISM
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
JACKSON LEE). The Chair recognizes the
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.
SCHRIER) for 5 minutes.
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, I
want to applaud my colleagues, espe-
cially Mr. ENGEL and Mr. MCCAUL, for
sending a strong message with a vote
on H.R. 221, the Special Envoy to Mon-
itor and Combat Anti-Semitism Act.
Jewish people enjoy freedom, accept-
ance, and assimilation in this country
like we never have before. Sadly, in re-
cent years, there has been a disturbing
uptick in anti-Semitic rhetoric and
acts both in the U.S. and Europe.
In the context of rising intolerance,
hatred, and xenophobia in our country,
we are witnessing emboldened normal-
ization of anti-Semitic language and
behavior. This includes anti-Semitic
propaganda targeting many of us new
Members of Congress. The tragic shoot-
ing at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pitts-
burgh was the deadliest attack on Jews
in our Nation’s history.
Bigotry is not unique to the Jewish
community. What is, however, is that
we don’t have anyone monitoring and
responding to the uptick in anti-Se-
mitic acts and rhetoric.
This bill elevates the State Depart-
ment’s top position to that of Ambas-
sador, reporting directly to the Sec-
retary of State. The stature of this po-
sition sends the strong message that
we are committed to combating anti-
Semitism here and abroad.
As a Jewish woman, anti-Semitism is
personal for me, but we need to under-
stand this in the context of the larger
issues of intolerance and White nation-
alism that are gaining traction in our
country right now.
No minority is safe when any minor-
ity is targeted. We should all be on
high alert when Muslims, Blacks,
Latinos, and immigrants are cast as
‘‘the other,’’ scapegoated, and dehu-
manized. We cannot sit idly by while
people are targeted for how they dress,
how they look, or how they choose to
worship.
I ask my counterparts in the Senate
to pass this bipartisan bill. Let’s show
the world that America takes this
issue seriously and that hate has no
place here.
f
END HUNGER NOW
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN) for 5
minutes.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
hope the President will start paying at-
tention to the negative impacts of his
pointless government shutdown when,
in coming weeks, his actions deliver a
devastating blow to some of America’s
most vulnerable families.
In 2018, over 40 million Americans
participated in SNAP, the Supple-
mental Nutrition Assistance Program,
formerly known as food stamps, or
about 12 percent of the population.
When the President and Senate Re-
publicans let USDA’s funding expire,
the problem didn’t just affect Federal
employees; it extended to low-income
families, farmers, and businesses.
If this shutdown continues, 40 million
Americans will be at even greater risk
of food insecurity as soon as March
2019, not to mention the millions of
Americans who participate in child nu-
trition programs like school meals and
other programs like WIC, the Women
Infants and Children Food and Nutri-
tion Service.
Last week, Secretary Perdue an-
nounced that USDA only has enough
money to fund SNAP until the end of
February. This means that in a few
short weeks, millions of American fam-
ilies won’t know where their next meal
is coming from simply because the
President wanted to throw a temper
tantrum over building a wall.
Now, some may ask, why panic over
something that won’t happen for an-
other month? Our timing on this is
crucial. Just because we have time be-
fore SNAP, child nutrition programs,
or WIC lose funding does not mean that
we should wait until the last minute to
fix the problem.
Nearly two-thirds of SNAP partici-
pants are children, elderly, or people
with disabilities. In my home State of
Massachusetts, over 760,000 people re-
ceive assistance. It is a program that is
crucial for low-income, hardworking
families.
SNAP is often just a supplement to a
person’s or family’s monthly food
budget. The average SNAP participant
receives about $126 a month, which
breaks down to a little over $1.40 per
person, per meal.
b 1030
Believe it or not, the funds that the
President is demanding for his wall
could be used to pay for an entire
month of food for all 40 million SNAP
participants, and then some.
And while the SNAP funding problem
starts with low-income families, de-
pending on how long this shutdown
continues, furloughed Federal employ-
ees themselves may temporarily need
to rely on SNAP to keep food on the
table.
The shutdown is also negatively im-
pacting thousands of businesses that
are seeking and updating their SNAP
licenses, not to mention the negative
impacts on thousands of farmers who
are already feeling the backlash of the
President’s tariffs. These same farmers
are facing further setbacks, because
they will now face delays in processing
and receiving the exact Federal aid
that was promised to help subsidize
their losses.
Madam Speaker, none of this has
anything to do with the debate over
border security. The President should
not be holding these families hostage
over this debate.
Last Thursday, the House passed a
key spending bill to fund the USDA be-
cause we recognize the crippling effects
that these funding gaps have on the
American people. We have programs
like SNAP, WIC, and Federal farm
loans for a reason: because they make
a difference in people’s lives.
We owe it to our constituents to lis-
ten to their voices and to do the job
they elected us to do, but we can’t do
it without the support of our Senate
colleagues. Madam Speaker, our coun-
terparts in the Senate ought to con-
sider all that is at stake when they
shut down our government. This isn’t
about partisanship. This is about act-
ing in the best interest of our constitu-
ents.
Today marks the 24th day in what
has become the longest Federal shut-
down in our country’s history, and we
have nothing to show for it. What a
shame. The President ought to con-
sider the real impact his shutdown is
having on Federal employees and low-
income families, children, seniors, and
persons with disabilities.
It is not a game, Mr. President. This
isn’t the art of the deal. Real people
are being hurt. Real lives are being
thrown into chaos. Let’s reopen the
government so we can have an in-
formed and rational debate about how
best to secure our southern border.
Madam Speaker, I am not going to be
silent while millions of families are
caught in the crosshairs of a medieval
solution to the real 21st century chal-
lenges this country is facing. Families,
children, farmers, and small businesses
don’t deserve this. We can’t let this
government shutdown get to a point
where we fail to provide our most vul-
nerable citizens with the food assist-
ance that they need to thrive. That is
cruel.
Let us do the job we were sent here
to do. Let’s end this stupid shutdown.
Let’s stop families from going hungry,
and let’s end hunger now.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-

f
HONORING JOSEPH FARINA
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
New York (Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALO-
NEY) for 5 minutes.
Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of
New York. Madam Speaker, at a time
of dysfunction and rancor, it is useful
to remember a time when America led
the world because of the heroism of ev-
eryday Americans. I rise today to
honor the life and legacy of Sergeant
Joseph Farina of New Windsor, New
York.
Joe was a regular guy who ran a
bowling alley in Newburgh, New York.
He was a 20-year-old and a member of
the National Guard when America was
attacked at Pearl Harbor on December
7, 1941. That very night, Joseph volun-
teered for service.
During war, he was deployed to the
Philippines and New Guinea, where his
service earned him four battle stars,
numerous other medals, and two Presi-
dential citations.
Joseph passed away at his home last
month at the age of 97. Next to him
was his wife of 76 years, Elizabeth,
whom he had married in Brisbane, Aus-
tralia, at the height of the war in 1942.
Joseph would actually work in Aus-
tralia for many years and pioneer the
sport of bowling there.
But his legacy is far broader than
that, not only to his country during his
service in World War II, but also to the
veterans community in the Hudson
Valley and across America.
He was active in many veterans orga-
nizations, the Catholic War Veterans,
and he helped to cofound the National
Purple Heart Hall of Honor in New
Windsor, New York. The Hall of Honor
is dedicated to collecting and sharing
the stories of Purple Heart recipients.
No comprehensive list of Purple Heart
recipients exists, and the hall acts as
an important archive and monument to
their service.
Joseph, like so many in his genera-
tion, knew what it meant to serve oth-
ers. Like so many in his generation, he
worked in his community and was a
person dedicated to something bigger
than himself. What a powerful lesson
for all of us to recall today. He was a
model American citizen, and he will be
missed.
f
TRIBUTE TO MAYOR LARRY
LANGFORD
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Alabama (Ms. SEWELL) for 5 minutes.
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor the ex-
traordinary life and legacy of late
Mayor Larry Paul Langford. Mayor
Langford was a beloved mayor of Bir-
mingham and Fairfield, as well as serv-
ing Jefferson County as its first Afri-
can American president of the Jeffer-
son County Commission. He devoted
much of his time to big ideas for the
people whom he loved in the commu-
nities that he served.
Mayor Langford will be remembered
as a larger-than-life personality who
broke barriers as the first Black re-
porter for the region at WBRC; the
first Black mayor of Fairfield, Ala-
bama; the first Black president of the
Jefferson County Commission; and as
mayor of Birmingham. A Vietnam vet,
Mayor Langford served in public office
in multiple capacities for nearly 23
years, and he will be greatly missed by
our community.
On March 17, 1946, Larry Langford
was born to John Langford and to Lil-
lian Nance Langford as the oldest of six
children. He was a proud graduate of
Parker High School in Birmingham,
Alabama. After high school, he enlisted
in the United States Air Force, serving
for 5 years during the Vietnam war.
Langford returned home with a re-
newed sense of community and a re-
newed sense of service. He quickly
completed his college degree at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham,
and he became the first African Amer-
ican male to become a news reporter
for WBRC 6 News in its region.
The importance of this role was
never lost on Langford. He knew that,
after the tumultuous decade before, to
have an African American man report-
ing the news in this area was an impor-
tant sign of progress in the city of Bir-
mingham. Langford did well as a re-
porter, using his charisma and out-
going personality. He was able to speak
with the people of Birmingham and tell
their stories.
Langford decided to run for his first
political office. He was elected to the
Birmingham City Council in 1977,
where he quickly became known as the
liveliest and most outspoken of city
council members, as well as the most
media savvy.
During his time on the Birmingham
City Council, he also worked as a radio
news director and contributed to the
Birmingham Times. After an unsuc-
cessful run for mayor of the city of Bir-
mingham against fellow Councilman
Richard Arrington, Jr., in 1979,
Langford temporarily retreated from
public life. By 1982, Langford had
moved to Fairfield, Alabama, a suburb
of Birmingham, and married the love of
his life, Miss Melva Ferguson. A few
years later, he decided to return to
public life and ran for mayor of Fair-
field, handily defeating a crowded field
of candidates.
Langford became the first African
American mayor of the city of Fair-
field in 1988, another first. After his
election, he led an aggressive campaign
to revitalize the city. Langford was
granted more authority and helped to
save the Fairfield City Schools from
bankruptcy, and he pushed for regional
cooperation in economic development
that led to an agreement between 11
Jefferson County municipalities which
joined forces in 1998 to finance and con-
struct a $90 million project called
Visionland, an amusement park that
he brought to the city of Birmingham.
It was actually in Bessemer, and it was
part of a regional cooperation.
During his four terms as Fairfield
mayor, Langford set his eyes on the
Jefferson County Commission, where
he hoped to continue to develop more
regional cooperation in economic de-
velopment. Langford was elected to the
Jefferson County Commission in 2002,
defeating the incumbent.
After becoming elected to the com-
mission, he was quickly elected by his
peers to be its president, another first.
During his tenure as president of the
Jefferson County Commission, he pro-
posed a 1 percent sales tax that helped
build 30 new schools and generated over
$1 billion in revenue.
In 2006, Mayor Langford ran again for
the mayor of Birmingham for a second
run. This time, he was successful and
won in a very crowded field without a
runoff.
Mayor Langford was sworn into of-
fice on November 13, 2007, as mayor of
Birmingham. He went on to strike an
agreement with a foundation that pro-
vided computers to schoolchildren
throughout the city of Birmingham.
Nearly 17,000 elementary and middle
school children received laptops that
year.
While Mayor Langford’s 23-year po-
litical career resulted in many success-
ful public projects, his service was not
without controversy. Mayor Langford’s
tenure as mayor of Birmingham was
cut short when a jury found him guilty
of public corruption on October 28, 2009,
and he was sentenced to 15 years. After
serving 81⁄2 years, on December 28, 2018,
due to his failing health, Mayor
Langford’s sentence was commuted by
a Federal judge, giving him compas-
sionate release. The next day, Mayor
Langford was transferred from a Fed-
eral prison to Birmingham Hospital,
where he remained until his death.
I want you to know, on a personal
note, Mayor Langford was an out-
standing mayor and his service will al-
ways be remembered and beloved by
the community that loved him so
much. I was honored to be a part of his
funeral and to help him get his compas-
sionate release. It is important that we
remember the totality of his career.
I ask my colleagues to join me in re-
membering Mayor Larry Langford.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

reverse a longstanding Medicare prohi-
bition on critical health services for
our seniors.
Since its implementation in 1965,
Medicare has excluded coverage for
hearing aids and related audiology
services, routine dental care, and rou-
tine eye exams and eyeglasses, despite
the large number of older Americans
who critically need these items and
services.
The Commonwealth Fund reports
that, among all Medicare beneficiaries
who needed a hearing aid, only 75 per-
cent did not have one. Of those who
had trouble eating because of problems
with their teeth, 70 percent had not
seen a dentist in the past year. And of
those who had trouble seeing, 43 per-
cent had not had an eye exam in the
past year. The reason for many seniors
was affordability.
According to the latest statistics
from the Kaiser Family Foundation,
more than half of Medicare bene-
ficiaries live on incomes below $26,200
per year. For them to pay out of pock-
et creates extreme hardship.
Sadly, reliable data shows that ne-
glect of all health, and even the lack of
routine dental exams and cleanings,
can deteriorate overall physical health
and exacerbate serious and com-
plicated health problems that increase
with age.
It is also increasingly well docu-
mented that untreated vision and hear-
ing loss diminishes quality of life and
increases the risk of costly health out-
comes, such as falls and resulting dis-
ability, depression, and dementia.
My bill would remove the restric-
tions currently prohibiting Medicare
coverage of these basic healthcare ne-
cessities such as eyeglasses, hearing
aids, and dental care. Expanding Medi-
care coverage for these services is a
cost-effective intervention that will
prevent accidents, falls, cognitive im-
pairments, and increases in chronic
conditions and oral cancer.
Madam Speaker, if we do not address
these gaps in health coverage now, the
overall health of our aging population
will continue to suffer and the need for
costly and avoidable services will in-
crease. But most importantly, giving
our older adults the gift of hearing, vi-
sion, and oral health would go a long
way toward helping our seniors enjoy
their golden years free from depression
and social isolation.
It is time to recognize that total
healthcare for our seniors must include
adequate access to vision, hearing, and
dental services. I urge my colleagues to
cosponsor the Seniors Have Eyes, Ears,
and Teeth Act, and ensure a healthier
future for all our seniors.

PUT THE PEOPLE FIRST AND END
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Massachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN) for 5
minutes.
Mrs. TRAHAN. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to speak about what is now
the longest government shutdown in
American history, its impact on the
hardworking men and women of Massa-
chusetts, and the opportunity cost of
the current impasse.
Over the last several weeks, I have
heard heartbreaking stories from Fed-
eral workers and their families from
across north central Massachusetts.
During a meeting I had last week in
Andover with furloughed IRS employ-
ees, I heard about veterans struggling
to afford their prescriptions and par-
ents worrying about putting food on
the table.
One woman had just recently lost her
husband and others were still recov-
ering from last September’s gas explo-
sions in the Merrimack Valley. A few
days earlier, I spoke with an air traffic
controller at Logan Airport who, after
hearing President Trump’s assurances
from the Oval Office that the budget
standoff would not lead to a shutdown
last month, felt comfortable splurging
on Christmas presents for his wife and
four children. Now, with the bills com-
ing due and his pay stub reading zero,
he and his family are confronted with
anxiety and financial hardship.
Each of the over 800,000 Federal
workers impacted by this shutdown,
close to 7,500 in Massachusetts alone,
has a story to share. I am the daughter
of a union iron worker and the coun-
try’s biggest union, the AFL–CIO, has a
saying: A fair day’s wage for a fair
day’s work. We gain nothing from pun-
ishing the dedicated Federal work-
force, nor do we position ourselves to
recruit the best and the brightest if we
can’t even keep the lights on.
Today, the majority in this Chamber
continues to vote for legislation that
reopens the Federal Government, re-
stores critical services, and makes Fed-
eral employees financially whole again.
As we continue to wait on the Presi-
dent and his party’s leadership in the
Senate to do the right thing by approv-
ing House-passed legislation to end this
shutdown, critical pieces of legislation
languish as the American people wait
anxiously for Congress to act on real
issues and crises, not the manufactured
one on the border.
Healthcare costs continue to rise.
Our climate is rapidly changing as
coastal communities suffer from more
intense storms and more frequent
flooding, while California has faced
down some of the largest and deadliest
fires in the history of the State.
Gun violence continues to rip apart
families and communities, and more
Americans died of an opioid overdose
than died during the Vietnam war.
There is so much more we should be fo-
cused on.
Madam Speaker, we cannot allow
shutting down the government over a
policy debate to become the new nor-
mal. I was here as a staffer in 1995 dur-
ing Newt Gingrich’s shutdown and re-
member feeling that it was an unprece-
dented event, never to happen again.
Sadly, that feeling was wrong.
We were all elected to this body to
debate issues that matter to the Amer-
ican people. It is what our constituents
expect us to do. It is time to open the
government and debate border security
on the floor of the people’s House for
all to see.
Ensuring the safety and the security
of the United States is among our most
solemn responsibilities. I take it very
seriously, but the only crisis right now
is the one the President is making.
Each day that the administration
keeps the government closed, it threat-
ens the financial security of Federal
workers, the people who process our
taxes, inspect our food, and ensure air-
port security as well as all of the peo-
ple who depend upon them.
Each day of the shutdown is a day
lost supporting education, improving
roads and bridges, and providing afford-
able healthcare.
We have sent bill after bill to the
upper Chamber to provide border secu-
rity and reopen the government. This
week, we will do it again. If the Presi-
dent wants to improve border security,
he should work with Democrats on real
solutions.
Madam Speaker, I oppose a $5 billion
wall. Experts say the wall won’t stop
the flow of drugs or prevent visa
overstays. The people who live at the
border don’t want it. But wherever you
stand on funding a border wall, holding
Federal employees and their families
hostage is unacceptable.
Madam Speaker, it is time to put
people first, end this government shut-
down, and get back to work.

MOURNING THE LOSS OF GDANSK
MAYOR PAWEL ADAMOWICZ
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR) for 5 minutes.
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, as co-
chair of the bipartisan Congressional
Caucus on Poland, it is with a truly
heavy heart that I rise this morning to
express deepest sympathy to our NATO
ally, Poland, and its countrymen and
women on the brutal slaying of vision-
ary Gdansk Mayor Pawel Adamowicz.
Mayor Adamowicz had served his city
since 1998 as it championed the values
of liberty, equality, and democracy. I
hold profound respect for his enduring
dedication, perseverance, and honor-
able service to his community and na-
tion. He loved Gdansk as a beacon for
a free Poland and gave his life to it.
What a deep tragedy this is for his
grieving family, his wife, his children,
his associates, for the Polish nation,
and for freedom-loving people every-
where.
Far too much blood has been shed on
Polish soil for the world to ignore such
a heinous crime that took his life.
I visited Gdansk in both 2009 and 2013,
and through these visits, I gained an
even deeper respect for its noble his-
tory and its place on Earth, including
the location where Nazi shelling at
Westerplatte began the cataclysmic in-
vasion of Poland starting World War II.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H553
January 15, 2019
This year, we will commemorate the
80th anniversary of that moment.
Then more recently, Gdansk’s re-
demptive transformative role in world
history with the courageous
Solidarnosc worker strikes that trip-
wired the collapse of tyranny across
Central Europe, imposed by the Soviet
Union, ushering in the possibility of
freedom for the millions who suffered
under dehumanizing repression for over
half a century.
In our modern era, Gdansk became
that symbol of liberty. It formally
partnered with the city of Cleveland,
Ohio, which I am privileged to rep-
resent, along with Congresswoman
MARCIA FUDGE, in a sister-cities rela-
tionship. As part of my own congres-
sional district, I am deeply honored
and proud of this relationship.
In Mayor Adamowicz’s memory, I
and this Congress must stand ready to
strengthen this alliance of liberty, cer-
tainly at this moment in history. In
his memory, our Poland Caucus must
pursue an annual liberty exchange in
his name to nurture aspiring young
Polish leaders who follow in his foot-
steps in pursuit of liberty and security
for Poland.
Let his death serve as a constant re-
minder of how precious freedom re-
mains. I am certain Polish law enforce-
ment officials will examine the cir-
cumstances surrounding the perpetra-
tor’s actions with a diligent eye. They
must ascertain whether there are any
linkages that exist with outside influ-
ence or propaganda that might have
catalyzed this heinous crime.
I know I speak on behalf of all Amer-
icans and of millions of Polish Ameri-
cans across our country, including in
Ohio, to remind all freedom-loving peo-
ple that the United States stands with
Poland now at this hour of mourning.
During these uncertain times, we
must work to strengthen our trans-
atlantic and NATO alliances through
increased diplomatic, cultural, and
military exchanges.
May the soul of Mayor Pawel
Adamowicz rest in peace, and may the
worth of his noble life inspire the
young leaders of Poland to pursue his
visionary leadership.
f
OPEN THE GOVERNMENT
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania).
The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5
minutes.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker,
today reflects two interesting com-
memorations. First, it is the actual
birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr., who lost his life in a fight for jus-
tice for public employees. I wonder
what he would say on this day while we
are in the longest shutdown that is
really against the Nation’s proud and
needed Federal employees across the
Nation.
I think it is important for my col-
leagues to reflect that 80 percent of
those impacted who work for the Fed-
eral Government are outside of the
Capital of the United States.
The second commemoration is a
founder’s day for Alpha Kappa Alpha.
That is the group of young women who
organized in a segregated America at
Howard University to stand for service
to the Nation. They were African
American young women. As I have
said, in a segregated Nation, in the
midst of Jim Crow-ism, these women
stood up to be servants of change and
good business.
As I mention this, I do it because of
where we are today. It is important to
note the tragic impact that we cannot
see that are not the headlines of Fed-
eral employees, their families, but even
those who are not Federal employees
impacted by the lack of service, such
as a disabled woman who may not get
her payments from HUD and may be
evicted from housing that she des-
perately needs.
So why are we here? It is interesting
that for the 2 years that the President
has served after convincing every voter
in America that any wall will be paid
for by the country of Mexico, our
neighbor and our friend, he never found
a pathway for that to happen, because
it was a fantasy, untrue, and it would
never happen.
But in the 2 years that he had the
Presidency, the Republican Party, the
House and the Senate, he never made
an issue of this wall. But when the Na-
tion wanted a change and elected
Democrats to the House of Representa-
tives in the majority, all of a sudden in
the close of the Mueller investigation
and a number of other investigations
going forward, indictments of various
collaborators and close associates of
the White House, all of a sudden the
wall becomes a major national issue,
rather than the crisis of dealing with
the needs of the American people from
gun violence, to jobs, to dealing with
our disasters, it is that.
But, yet, we have worked as Demo-
crats in the House to get the govern-
ment open and to stop the Trump shut-
down. When we first were sworn in, we
voted on every bipartisan bill that the
Senate had voted on to open the gov-
ernment. That was the week of Janu-
ary 3. We then, in the last week, voted
for every Republican appropriations
bill in order to send to the Senate for
the government to be open.
Then there were ideas of extending
the homeland security funding for a
short period of time to February 8, 3
weeks. We supported that. We were
even eager to hear from the Senator
from South Carolina to open the gov-
ernment and then begin the negotia-
tions.
None of these suggestions were
taken. In fact, the suggestion of the
Senator from South Carolina, a Repub-
lican, was rejected out of hand on this
past Monday.
The President has not been able to
provide his own solutions. He has not
understood smart border security
means we can sit down and devise ways
to ensure more personnel, to be able to
make sure there are TSO officers, Bor-
der Patrol officers, Customs and Border
Protection, laptops, technology,
drones, and scanners.
b 1100
That is what the American people be-
lieve in. That is what the American
people believe in. The American people
are smart. They know that we can find
a solution, and they also know the so-
lution comes in many forms, an infra-
structure of some sort.
Those of us on the border States have
been to the border. It is our home. We
have seen the 700 miles of border infra-
structure. We have seen construction
going on.
I just came back from the border
again. I am from Texas. I was there in
the space where Felipe, the little boy
who died, came across. He came across
with family members. They turned
themselves in seeking asylum. More
courts and more judges we need to en-
sure—
So there is a solution. In the name of
Dr. Martin Luther King, I would sim-
ply say: let us be a peace finder, and let
us be a warrior for justice and find the
peace and solve the problem. Open the
government to this White House.

THE PLIGHT OF AMERICAN
WORKERS
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
JACKSON LEE). The Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
BRENDAN F. BOYLE) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I rise to praise
what must be two corporate CEO su-
perstars based on just how much they
have made in compensation.
The first is Irene Rosenfeld who was
CEO of Mondelez/Nabisco. Over the last
5 years she was paid over $100 million,
and her successor—who makes Ms.
Rosenfeld look poor by comparison—
Mr. Dirk Van de Put in 41 days was
paid $42 million.
Now, $42 million for 41 days of work,
$105 million for the last 5 years’ worth
of work, you must think: What super-
stars these two are. What great
achievements or great invention did
these two CEOs come up with?
Here is what they have done leading
Nabisco.
They closed the factory in Philadel-
phia in my district that employed hun-
dreds of people for over 60 years. They
closed a similar plant in Chicago that
employed over 600 people. By the way,
when I say employed, I am not talking
about minimum wage jobs. I am talk-
ing about good, family-sustaining jobs.
Now, where did these jobs go?
To what other part of the United
States did they go?
Salinas, Mexico, where workers, in-
stead of getting family-sustaining
wages, are getting paid approximately
$1.50 an hour. That is wrong. When you
wonder why there is such angst in our

economy today, despite the histori-
cally low unemployment rate, this is
why.
In case you think that Philadelphia
and Chicago might be exceptions to
this Nabisco business model, they have
also done it in Pittsburgh, Houston,
Niles, St. Elmo, Buena Park, and as I
have mentioned, of course, Philadel-
phia and Chicago.
This is greed on steroids.
So the next time you crave an Oreo
or crave Chips Ahoy!—both Nabisco
brands—Madam Speaker, I urge you to
take a look at the back of the package
and see whether or not it was still
made in the United States or if it is
one of the products that is now made in
Mexico.
Madam Speaker, I also urge you to
do this: contact your Member of Con-
gress and say that you are not going to
accept trade deals and tax policies that
allow this sort of disgraceful behavior
to happen—the hollowing out of Amer-
ican middle class jobs.
It is wrong, and we the elected offi-

mentarily or in passing.
Be with each of us, that we may be

Bless the Members of this people’s
House in their work and deliberations
today, that they might merit the trust

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The SPEAKER. Will the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania (Ms. SCAN-
LON) come forward and lead the House
in the Pledge of Allegiance.
Ms. SCANLON led the Pledge of Alle-

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I
rise today on behalf of Joe Shuker, a
Federal worker in my district.
I met with Joe on Friday after he
reached out, looking for help for his
colleagues, TSA agents who have been
working for 3 weeks without pay. Their
jobs are stressful, and many of them
live paycheck to paycheck. Now they
have the added stress of struggling to
pay mortgages, rent, childcare, or even
to put food on the table. Many can’t af-
ford to get gas to get to their jobs.
Joe has gone door to door to get peo-
ple to donate food and diapers to meet
the most basic needs of his coworkers
and their families. He told me about a
family with a 3-month-old baby. They
can’t afford baby formula—baby for-
mula.
This is unacceptable.
Holding Federal workers hostage and
shutting down our government is a
failed tactic. The House has sent legis-
lation to reopen the government to the
Senate three times. We have done our
job. The Senate needs to do its.

CONGRATULATING NATIONAL
CHAMPIONS CENTRAL METH-
ODIST UNIVERSITY EAGLES
MEN’S SOCCER TEAM
(Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I
rise to pay tribute to the Central Meth-
odist University Eagles men’s soccer
team of Fayette, Missouri, in Mis-
souri’s Fourth Congressional District,
winner of the NAIA men’s national soc-
cer championship.
Head coach Alex Nichols and the Ea-
gles capped off a superb 22–2-2 season
with a penalty shootout victory over
Missouri Valley in the championship
finale in Irvine, California.
This national soccer championship is
the first ever for any team sport for
Central Methodist University. It is the
culmination of steady progress that
saw the Eagles move from a top 30
ranking three seasons ago, to a top 20
ranking two seasons ago, to a top 12
ranking last season, and, finally, to the
number one spot this past season.
I congratulate the Central Methodist
University Eagles on winning the na-
tional championship. Your hard work,
dedication, and determination paid off
and left an example future teams will
strive to follow.
Well done.
f
REOPEN OUR GOVERNMENT
(Ms. SHALALA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
rise in solidarity with the thousands of
Federal employees in my district and
across this Nation who, because of the
shutdown, haven’t received a paycheck.
I want to share the story of Robert
Guevara, a Federal aviation safety in-
spector in my district who did not re-
ceive a paycheck this past Friday. He
is tasked with overseeing the airline’s
mechanics and repairing facilities so
operations run smoothly and safely at
Miami International Airport. He has
one goal: aviation safety. He prides
himself on keeping our travelers safe
and ensuring that all inspections are as
thorough and accurate as possible.
After 21 years of service in the Air
Force, he told me he could barely rec-
ognize our country anymore. How can
the greatest country on Earth tell its
employees to work without a pay-
check? How can we hold our patriots
hostage?
Madam Speaker, no one wins in a
shutdown. We must demand that this
administration and the Senate leader-
ship reopen our government.
f
AMERICA’S PARTNERSHIP WITH
FINLAND
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.
Madam Speaker, America is grateful
for our alliance with Finland, a loyal
NATO partner, to promote regional se-
curity.
Finnish Defense Minister Jussi
Niinisto wrote an article in Defense
News reviewing our partnership:
‘‘Today, the Finnish Defence Forces
are more capable and more interoper-
able than they have ever been. That
makes [Finland] effective in looking
after our own security and a solid part-
ner for other EU member states and
NATO countries.
‘‘During my time as the minister of
defense of Finland, we have taken
other steps to strengthen the trans-At-
lantic link. A prime example is our bi-
lateral defense relationship with the

United States. In October 2016, we

the United States in May 2018.’’
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.
f
MOOCHER STATES
(Mr. GOTTHEIMER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to put on notice every
State mooching New Jersey’s tax dol-
lars.
Last week, a new Rockefeller report
revealed what we have known for too
long: Some States, like New Jersey,
are paying their own weight and pay-
ing their own way. Other States are
not. They are mooching off the rest of
us.
My district his historically received
33 cents for every dollar it sends to
Washington, D.C., while other States,
like Mississippi and Alabama, receive 7
to 12 times that amount, depending
upon the study.
According to one study, the National
Priorities Project report, as you see
here, moocher States like Mississippi
receive $4.38 for every dollar they send
to Washington.
This news is only compounded by the
fact that, come tax season, the tax
hike bill, which gutted the State and
local tax deductions, kicks in and will
really start to hurt my district. That
was a giveaway to the moocher States
and was largely paid for by States like
mine.
New Jersey is one of the top tax-pay-
ing States in the Nation, which is why
we must cut taxes there for residents
and businesses of all sizes and work
with mayors to continue to do like I
have done to claw back more dollars to
the State. We are already up 16 per-
cent.
Madam Speaker, as this new Con-
gress begins, I am making it one of my
core missions to reinstate the SALT
deduction, stop double taxation, and
fight back against the moocher States
who continue to rob us blind. It is time
to fight to get more dollars back to
States like ours.
f
HUMAN TRAFFICKING
(Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, this
month, we celebrate Human Traf-
ficking and National Slavery Preven-
tion Month, and I rise today to draw
attention to the importance of com-
bating this epidemic.
Human trafficking takes many
forms, including sex, forced labor, and
domestic servitude. Educating individ-
uals about human trafficking is essen-
tial to thwarting this modern day form
of slavery.
This need for increased awareness is
why I have partnered with the Center
for Prevention of Abuse in Peoria, Illi-
nois, and also the U.S. Department of
Homeland Security to host two human
trafficking awareness prevention
roundtables in my district, bringing to-
gether State, local, and Federal offi-
cials. We held valuable dialogues with
those on the front lines of this crisis
about ways to end human trafficking
for good.
This week, I am proud to be joining
my colleague, Congresswoman VAL
DEMINGS from Florida, to introduce a
resolution to formally recognize Janu-
ary as National Trafficking and Mod-
ern Day Slavery Prevention Month in
Congress.
As I have learned firsthand, com-
bating human trafficking will take a
multifaceted approach, but if we con-
tinue to educate and make resources
available at all levels, important
strides can be made and we can end
this crisis.
f
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
(Ms. GABBARD asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. GABBARD. Madam Speaker, it
has been 25 days, 25 days since over
800,000 Federal employees have either
been going to work without pay or
have been furloughed, all of them won-
dering: How am I going to pay my rent
or my mortgage? How am I going to af-
ford the bills that I need to pay to take
care of my family?
I heard recently from Jay from the
island of Maui, in my district of Ha-
waii, who is a TSA employee who has
been working this entire time without
pay, wondering how he is going to pay
his mortgage, car, credit card pay-
ments, and lifesaving medical care that
he needs to provide for his daughter.
Jay is not alone. Our national parks
are filling with trash. Our Coast Guard
members are working without pay,
being told they should hold garage
sales or start babysitting to help pay
the bills while the government is shut
down.
Food stamps for tens of millions of
Americans are at risk, while low-in-
come housing subsidies aren’t being re-
newed, impacting over 340,000 elderly
and disabled veterans who depend on
that rental assistance. The safety and
security of our country is at risk.
We cannot turn our backs on our
brothers and sisters. These are real
people, real families, real lives, and
real futures.
Senator MCCONNELL and President
Trump must pass the bipartisan legis-
lation we have already passed and re-
open the government now.
f
CELEBRATING SESQUICENTENNIAL
OF JOHNSON CITY, TENNESSEE
(Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.)
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, today, I rise to cele-
brate and pay tribute to my hometown
of Johnson City, Tennessee, for its ses-
quicentennial.
In 1856, entrepreneur Henry Johnson
opened a railroad station and a com-
mercial business, Johnson’s Depot.
Just 13 years later, in 1869, Johnson
City was founded, holding its first elec-
tion on January 3, 1870, when voters
elected Mr. Johnson as the city’s first
mayor.
Today, Johnson City boasts a diverse
economy, attracting national and re-
gional companies while also supporting
countless small business owners. The
city is home to three major hospitals;
to the James H. Quillen VA Medical
Center, which serves more than 170,000
veterans; and to East Tennessee State
University, recognized for the highly
regarded Quillen College of Medicine
and Gatton College of Pharmacy.
The city has become a thriving com-
munity of more than 66,000 residents,
and I look forward to what is in store
for Johnson City over the next 150
years. I doubt that I will be there.
Madam Speaker, I will include in the
RECORD a more complete statement of
Johnson City’s history.

RECOGNIZING TOMMY MAY
(Mr. HILL of Arkansas asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize
Tommy May and his inspirational ex-
ample of leadership throughout his life
and courage in battling ALS.
May served in Vietnam in the United
States Marine Corps before returning
home to the University of Arkansas
and the Walton College to earn his de-
gree in business. He would go on to es-
tablish a remarkable banking career,
eventually becoming president and
CEO of Simmons First National Bank
in 1987.
In 2005, May was diagnosed with ALS,
also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, be-
coming one of about 20,000 people living
with that disease in the United States.
Although statistics show that the aver-
age survival time is only 3 years, May
has survived far longer, continuing his
leadership for more than a decade at
Simmons First National Bank and at
the University of Arkansas for Medical
Sciences.
Since his diagnosis, he has helped
spearhead a new effort at UAMS to
speed up research on the disease. He
has been recognized for those efforts by
the university. My friend’s example of
perseverance and courage in continuing
to live his life on his own terms is one
that all Americans and Arkansans can
admire.

FURTHER ADDITIONAL CON-

Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
move to suspend the rules and pass the
joint resolution (H.J. Res. 27) making
further continuing appropriations for
fiscal year 2019, and for other purposes.
The Clerk read the title of the joint
resolution.
The text of the joint resolution is as
follows:
H.J. RES. 27
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

propriations Act, 2019 (division C of Public

ing ‘‘February 1, 2019’’.
This joint resolution may be cited as the

tions Act, 2019’’.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from
New York (Mrs. LOWEY) and the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. GRANGER) each
will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.J. Res.
27, currently under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, we are now in the
25th day of the Trump shutdown, the
longest Federal Government shutdown
in United States history.
This past Friday, hundreds of thou-
sands of dedicated Federal employees
went without a paycheck. It is shame-
ful that the stubborn whims of this
President have harmed the security of
America’s public servants. That in-
cludes Federal law enforcement offi-
cials at the FBI, the very Secret Serv-
ice agents who protect the President,
and those who work tirelessly to pro-
tect our air travel, our national parks,
our environment, and public health.
The bill before us is the seventh—let
me repeat, the seventh—piece of legis-
lation Democrats have put on the
House floor to end the Trump shut-
down and get the government back to
work for the American people. It will
reopen government through February
1, providing time for Congress to come
to a full-year agreement without fur-
ther jeopardizing vital services or the
pay of Federal workers.
It is long past time that Senate Re-
publicans join us to reopen the govern-
ment, pay our Federal employees, and
then negotiate on border security and
immigration policy. Madam Speaker, I
hope that my colleagues across the
Capitol come to their senses and end
this shutdown.
I urge support for this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in oppo-
sition to H.J. Res. 27, a continuing res-
olution providing funding through Feb-
ruary 1.
I support the goal of reopening the
government. There are many critical
programs that are on pause which are
important to my constituents and all
of us, programs like TSA, Border Pa-
trol, Coast Guard, and air traffic con-
trollers.
Unfortunately, the bill we are consid-
ering today will not restart those pro-
grams or help our districts. That is be-
cause it is not a comprehensive solu-
tion to resolve the government shut-
down and fully address the security
and humanitarian crisis we face on our
southern border.
Criminals, terrorists, and drugs are
flooding our shores. Tens of thousands
of children, many of them without
their parents, make the dangerous trip
to the United States every year. I have
been to the border and to Central
America, and I have heard the heart-
breaking stories. This situation is un-
acceptable and it must be addressed.
We can and we must do better.
Madam Speaker, again, I share the
concern that parts of the government

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H557
January 15, 2019
remain closed and employees are not
yet being paid, but moving this bill
across the floor will not fix the prob-
lem. To put it simply, there is not a bi-
partisan consensus on this plan.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I am
very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR),
my good friend, an outstanding legis-
lator, who is the chair-designate of the
Energy and Water Development, and
Related Agencies Subcommittee.
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I
thank Chairwoman LOWEY for the rec-
ognition and the opportunity to speak.
Madam Speaker, this vote is a trib-
ute to the thousands of Federal patri-
ots who have shown up to work for the
past 25 days, working with no pay. This
must end today. I call on my col-
leagues in this body to vote to support
our hardworking public servants.
This bill is a clean continuing resolu-
tion. It comprises short-term funding
through February 1 for all the agencies
and departments currently shuttered
for no good reason. Those include the
Department of Homeland Security, the
Department of Justice, the State De-
partment, the Interior Department, the
Agriculture Department, the Depart-
ment of Commerce, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of
Transportation, and many more agen-
cies.
The President is not serving this Na-
tion; he is not serving it well as he uses
his authority to harm our Republic.
Civil service workers are the bonds
that hold our country together.
The Commander in Chief is hurting
our Nation and holds our entire gov-
ernment hostage to his harebrained no-
tion that you can stop drug trafficking
and migration with a wall. The drug
traffickers must be laughing up a
storm. They already ship it here hidden
in legal cargo. They dug tunnels under
the 650 miles of border that already ex-
ists. They figured that out. And they
have been flying contraband material
over our border. They boat illegal con-
traband in here from our coastal ports,
and they ship it from China through
even the Postal Service, and we don’t
have a mechanism to detect fentanyl in
the mails.
To secure our Nation and our border,
our Nation first needs to open all our
government agencies for the American
people who are paying the bills, open
those departments and pay the men
and women who dedicate their lives to
protecting our borders and protecting
us. Once the government is open, we
can spend the next weeks discussing
how best to fund mechanisms that will
truly improve our security. This could
include thorough inspection of all
cargo.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield an additional 30 seconds to the
gentlewoman from Ohio.
Ms. KAPTUR. This could include en-
hanced electronic surveillance between
ports of entry. This could include addi-
tional personnel at all ports of entry to
increase checks. And, frankly, in com-
munities like I represent, it should in-
volve increasing DEA agents to take
care of the gangs that are trafficking
in these illegal materials.
But most importantly, we need a
President who understands you don’t
stop the drug trade or undocumented
migration of individuals by shuttering
the entire Department of Homeland Se-
curity or furloughing the border agents
or making them go to work with no
pay. He has got the wrong answer for
what America needs to address in bor-
der security.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Alabama (Mr. ADERHOLT).
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for the time.
Madam Speaker, I think we all agree
that the American people expect this
legislative body to deliver solutions to
the difficult challenges that face our
Nation each and every day.
As a longtime member of the Appro-
priations Committee, I have worked
with my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle over the years to try to reach
agreements when we were trying to
fund the Federal Government. What we
have to do is try to find common
ground.
The matter of how we fully fund the
Federal Government for the remainder
of FY19, of course, remains unsolved
basically for one reason: My colleagues
on the other side of the aisle won’t ne-
gotiate. They have rejected requests to
negotiate a deal. They need to come to
the table with a counteroffer. Instead,
they continue to kick the can down the
road and continue to play politics with
this issue.
Our colleagues reject the solutions
requested by the professional personnel
who actually protect the border. By
digging in a position which is political
and not policy, ultimately, they are re-
sponsible for the shutdown of the gov-
ernment agencies.
However, this short-term CR, known
as a continuing resolution, does not
solve the problem. The Democratic
leadership has said 100 percent no. This
bill hits, basically, the snooze button
for a few more weeks. I think it is time
that our colleagues on the other side of
the aisle wake up and negotiate and
come back to the table to find a real
solution.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I am
very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), my good friend,
who is the chair-designate of the Mili-
tary Construction, Veterans Affairs,
and Related Agencies Subcommittee.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge
my colleagues to reopen the Federal
Government and end this destructive
Trump shutdown. For 25 days now, the
Trump shutdown has inflicted financial
pain and anxiety on families, busi-
nesses, and entire communities across
the United States.
This week, I spoke with a room full
of these victims. Aviation safety ex-
perts detailed for me how the Trump
shutdown has eroded an air travel sys-
tem that, for now, is safe, but they are
growing worried and concerned.
I heard from Federal workers who
told me that the changes to tax laws
ushered in during the Republican tax
scam have left citizens scrambling for
answers, yet workers are not there who
can shepherd them through those
changes.
b 1230
A local leader who represents domes-
tic violence shelters warned me, if the
Trump shutdown drags on, as many as
a third of the Florida facilities that
women count on for refuge when they
are victims of domestic violence could
find themselves cutting services.
Democrats in the House have done
our job. We have passed half a dozen
bills to reopen the government, yet
Senate Republicans have decided to
hide behind President Trump and his
border boondoggle refusing to take
‘‘yes’’ for an answer that could end this
irresponsible shutdown.
While they are busy bowing to the
President, Senate Republicans reck-
lessly ignore that public safety is at
stake. They downplay, and even dis-
miss, that 800,000 families are now liv-
ing without a paycheck today.
Businesses, farmers, veterans, res-
taurant workers, domestic violence
victims, and many more are all feeling
real pain from this unnecessary shut-
down. We need to do our jobs. We need
to work together and actually be the
coequal branch of government that the
Constitution describes.
So today, House Democrats will do
just that and give Senate Republicans
another option to get us out of this lat-
est Trump trap and offer this bill that
would reopen all closed Federal agen-
cies through February 1. This bill
would allow time for us to negotiate
border security and immigration re-
form, but without inflicting further
economic harm on our families and our
businesses. It is the smart, reasonable,
and compassionate thing to do.
I ask my colleagues to pass this bill
into law without delay.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE).
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, it
is once again disappointing to witness
my Democratic colleagues pull polit-
ical stunts rather than make serious
efforts to find a compromise to reopen
the government.
This legislation that we have before
us today has only seen the light of day
for less than 24 hours. Democratic lead-
ership is abusing the suspension list—
something usually reserved for bipar-
tisan, noncontroversial legislation—to

play politics with this government
shutdown.
Let me be clear: This legislation will
not reopen the government. This has,
once again, as we have seen for 3 weeks
in a row now, House Democrats using
valuable time on the floor of the House
of Representatives to play partisan pol-
itics rather than to do our job to find
a real solution to reopen shuttered
agencies.
It is being reported that President
Trump has invited several House
Democrats to the White House today to
discuss the government shutdown and
potentially find solutions for com-
promise. Unfortunately, it is also being
reported that several of my fellow
House Members have rejected that in-
vitation. If that is true, it dem-
onstrates a serious neglect of our du-
ties as representatives of the people.
As my friend from California, JACKIE
SPEIER, rightly said just this morning
on cable news: ‘‘I think when the Presi-
dent calls, it is incumbent upon us to
respect the office and to attend the
meeting. And if they have been asked,
I would suggest that they go.’’
Madam Speaker, I could not agree
more. Every single Member of this
body should be working on behalf of
the American people to reopen this
government.
The President is demonstrating his
willingness to compromise. I sincerely
hope my Democratic colleagues will
heed the invitation and come to the
table with a real offer. Any rejection of
this invitation is a shameful disregard
of the seriousness of the situation be-
fore us.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I am
prepared to close. I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Tennessee (Mr. FLEISCHMANN).
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 27.
I thank Ranking Member GRANGER
for allowing me to speak on this very
important issue, and I thank my dis-
tinguished colleagues on the other side
of the aisle. Mrs. LOWEY is a friend
from New York. We have served to-
gether.
Madam Speaker, this situation is
frustrating. We have come to a place
right now where I received a phone call
last night from the Commandant of the
Coast Guard, Admiral Schultz. We
talked about the wonderful men and
women who are serving so well and so
hard and who are not going to get a
paycheck because of this situation.
We all want border security; I believe
that. But I also believe that President
Trump is right, that we need a wall, a
barrier.
I happen to represent the people of
the Third District of Tennessee—won-
derful people, east Tennessee—and they
tell me time and time again: Build a
wall; have a border; keep us safe; but
we also want the government open.
And when I look at the polling data,
when I look at the phone calls, it is
high time that we get back to work,
open the government, but keep us safe.
In our districts, we all represent Re-
publicans and Democrats and Independ-
ents. Hopefully, most of the people
vote. But even people who pay their
taxes who decide not to vote, they
count on the American Representa-
tives, our House, to work, and they
count on the Senate.
With all due respect, H.J. Res. 27 is
dead on arrival in the United States
Senate. We know that. The American
people know that. The President knows
that. We need a compromise on this
wall issue right now that will satisfy
security, that will keep the American
people safe, and, yes, that will open the
government.
Compromise is not a dirty word in
this scenario. It is what we need to do,
and we need good faith. I am not alleg-
ing bad faith on anyone in this body. I
am saying it is time to call a timeout
and get back to work and do the peo-
ple’s business.
They sent us here to govern. We need
to govern. We need a wall. We need bor-
der security, and we need the govern-
ment open. It is high time that we get
there.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD).
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker,
I rise in opposition to this bill. Another
week has gone by and we find ourselves
with another exercise in futility.
As I said last week, these CRs are a
waste of everyone’s time and a waste of
countless hours of hard work by mem-
bers of staff on both sides of the aisle.
While we waste floor time and the
American citizens’ time, there are
800,000 families—and more—that are
feeling the negative effects of the
gamesmanship on the other side of the
aisle. These effects are not limited to
government employees. Contractors,
small businesses, and the economy at
large have been suffering for weeks.
Just the other day, in Jacksonville, I
spoke with the father of a government
subcontractor who explained to me
how much this shutdown has hurt his
son’s livelihood.
Now, this idea that once the govern-
ment is opened back up and govern-
ment employees are going to receive
their backpay, as I am sure most even-
tually will, there are many across this
country who will not. His son is one of
them.
And just to prove how ridiculous this
entire thing is, due to the recalcitrance
of Democrats, experts say that this
shutdown has already cost our econ-
omy more than the President’s request
for the wall.
My colleagues on the other side of
aisle want to score political points by
denying our duly-elected President a
campaign promise, a simple promise to
protect the American citizen.
Rather than focusing energy on
reaching a compromise with the Senate
and the President to reopen the gov-
ernment and get Federal workers their
paychecks, we are spending time on
our bills, bringing bills to the floor
that have absolutely no chance of be-
coming law.
Here is my message to the House ma-
jority: Stop using working-class Amer-
icans as leverage and come to the table
to find a compromise on behalf of the
American people.
I have said it before, and I will say it
again: If the Speaker is serious about
opening the government and getting
people back to work, bring a bill to the
floor that the Senate will pass and the
President will sign.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this continuing
resolution, and I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, it is
time to end the Trump shutdown. Let’s
vote ‘‘yes.’’
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.
LOWEY) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the joint resolution, H.J.
Res. 27.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, on
that I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS) and the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.
FOXX) each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Maryland.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material
on H.R. 135.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland?
There was no objection.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, today I am very
pleased to bring to the floor six bills
from the Committee on Oversight and
Reform. Each bill, I am very glad to
say, enjoys bipartisan sponsorship.
These measures will strengthen protec-
tions for Federal employees and for
congressional interns and enhance ac-
countability and improve the Federal
procurement and grant processes.
The first measure we are bringing
today is H.R. 135, the Federal Em-
ployee Antidiscrimination Act. This
bill is essentially identical to legisla-
tion that has passed the House in each
of the two previous Congresses. In the
114th Congress, the measure passed by
a vote of 403–0; and in the last Con-
gress, it passed by voice vote.
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues—Representatives MEADOWS,
NORTON, SENSENBRENNER, and JACKSON
LEE—for working with me on this
measure.
b 1245
I thank them for their leadership and
their commitment for improving our
Federal equal opportunity programs.
Let me also thank Tanya Ward Jor-
dan, Paulette Taylor, and all the mem-
bers of the Coalition 4 Change, known
as C4C, for their work on this measure
and for their years of perseverance as
we have worked to try to get this
measure enacted into law.
One of my highest priorities as chair-
man of the Oversight Committee is to
protect the right of every single Fed-
eral employee, every Federal job appli-
cant, and indeed of every citizen, to
equality of opportunity. While the
clear majority of Federal workplaces
are in compliance with the standards
for a model Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity program promulgated by the
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission, sadly, some still are not. It is
past time for these failures to be cor-
rected.
During our committee’s bipartisan
investigations of several different
agencies—including the Forest Service,
the Park Service, and the Transpor-
tation Security Administration—we
have seen firsthand the consequences
that employees suffer when agencies
fail to operate model EEO programs or
when they do not handle complaints of
harassment and discrimination in a
fair, timely, consistent, and thorough
manner.
We have also seen how employees
who file complaints with their agen-
cies’ EEO programs can be victimized
again if appropriate steps are not
taken to prevent the disclosure of com-
plainants’ identities and personal in-
formation.
H.R. 135 would strengthen the man-
agement of Federal EEO programs by
requiring that they operate independ-
ently of agencies’ human resources and
general counsel offices. H.R. 135 would
require that the head of each agency
EEO program report directly to the
head of the agency. This policy is crit-
ical to ensuring that agencies
prioritize their EEO programs at the
highest levels and that their sole pur-
pose is to ensure equal opportunity for
all employees.
H.R. 135 would strengthen the ac-
countability mechanisms that are cen-
tral to effectiveness of the EEO proc-
ess. The bill would also prohibit any
forms, policies, or agreements that
seek to prevent an employee from dis-
closing waste, fraud, or abuse to Con-
gress, the Office of Special Counsel, or
an Inspector General.
Madam Speaker, the provisions in
this bill are very simple, and the entire
House has repeatedly supported them
on a bipartisan basis. I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 135, and I urge
the Senate to pass this bill as quickly
as possible.
Let me be clear that while the meas-
ure before us is important to improving
our Federal workplaces, many of those
workplaces are shut down today, and
they have been shut down longer than
at any time in our great Nation’s his-
tory. As the legislation before us
proves, we can come together in a bi-
partisan manner to enact measures
that will help the millions of Ameri-
cans who work for the Federal Govern-
ment.
As I have often said, our Federal em-
ployees do not want us, the govern-
ment, to hurt them; they want us to
help them. We ought to be able to come
together on a bipartisan basis and take
the simple step of reopening our gov-
ernment and ensuring that the pro-
grams and services on which our Na-
tion depends are functioning and that
the people who work for us get paid so
they can take care of their families and
take care of their bills, for they give
their blood, their sweat, and their tears
to keep our country together.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 135, the Federal Employee
Antidiscrimination Act. H.R. 135
amends the Notification and Federal
Employee Antidiscrimination and Re-
taliation Act of 2002, commonly re-
ferred to as the No-FEAR Act, to bet-
ter identify and correct instances of
discrimination throughout the Federal
Government.
Specifically, H.R. 135 requires Fed-
eral agencies to establish a system to
track Equal Employment Opportunity
complaints from beginning to end. This
system must also track any discipli-
nary action that resulted from a find-
ing of a discriminatory act. If a dis-
ciplinary action is taken by an agency
against an employee, both the discipli-
nary action and the reason for the ac-
tion must be included in the employ-
ee’s personnel record.
H.R. 135 implements notification and
reporting requirements for instances of
discrimination within Federal agen-
cies. Agencies must post a notice on
their website if the agency or Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission
finds that a discriminatory or retalia-
tory act has occurred.
The bill also requires agencies to sub-
mit a report to the EEOC if a discrimi-
natory or retaliatory act is found to
have occurred. The report must include
any disciplinary action initiated
against an employee for discrimination
or retaliation against another em-
ployee.
Lastly, the bill bars agencies from
using nondisclosure agreements or
policies to restrict Federal employees
from reporting waste, fraud, and abuse
to Congress, the Office of Special Coun-
sel, and Inspectors General.
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. CUM-
MINGS for his good work on this piece of
legislation, I urge my colleagues to
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield 4 minutes to the distinguished
gentlewoman from the District of Co-
lumbia (Ms. NORTON).
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I
thank the distinguished chairman for
yielding, and I particularly thank him
for his remarks concerning this bill.
I am particularly pleased to rise in
support of this bill as a former chair of
the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission. This bill strengthens the
protections Federal employees enjoy
under the antidiscrimination laws of
our country.
It reinforces the importance of this
antidiscrimination provisions by re-
quiring that the head of that program
report directly to the agency head. It
expands notification of findings of dis-
crimination and any action that has
been taken pursuant to those findings.
Surely, we understand the importance
of this section at a time when we have
just recently passed the sexual harass-
ment provisions, and, of course, we can
see the deterrent effect of assuring any
disciplinary action that has been taken
is known to the public.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H561
January 15, 2019
Finally, the bill bars agreements
that would keep employees from dis-
closing any kind of Federal violation,
as well as fraud, waste, and abuse. The
latter provision is normally called a
whistleblower provision.
Madam Speaker, I particularly ap-
preciate that the chairman has brought
this bill to the floor—I am sure it is
noncontroversial—but he has brought
it at a time when Federal employees
are experiencing the longest shutdown
in U.S. history. This bill cannot and
does not purport to make up in any
way for the effects of the shutdown.
But this bill sends a message to Fed-
eral employees that they are particu-
larly valued and, so far as I can tell, it
sends it in a unanimous fashion, just as
the shutdown should have a unanimous
resolution.
It happens that around 62,000 Federal
employees live in my own district, be-
cause this is the Capital of the United
States—the 62,000, I should add, who
are furloughed or working with no pay.
But I want to remind Members that
each and every Member of this body
has Federal employees who are at
home desiring to work and are fur-
loughed as I speak. Though I represent
a large number, some Members from
the far West States should know that
they are among those who represent
the largest number of Federal employ-
ees. That is how dependent they are far
away from Washington on Federal em-
ployees.
Madam Speaker, the President seems
to have moved a step away from claim-
ing dictatorial powers to commandeer
Federal funds to open the government.
That is probably because somebody
drew to his attention the extraordinary
spectrum of constitutional, legal, po-
litical, and financial issues that would
be raised, not to mention a court suit
that is probably being prepared, just in
case, as I speak.
But, Madam Speaker, I am coming to
the floor as well to urge our com-
mittee—and the new Democratic ma-
jority of which I am a member—to use
this crisis of Trump’s making to care-
fully rethink the President’s emer-
gency powers, leaving him ample room
to move in case of an actual emergency
while giving Congress more latitude to
contain executive excess.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield the gentlewoman from the Dis-
trict of Columbia an additional 2 min-
utes.
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, in the
meantime, I want to lay before the
House the easiest of compromises.
When I was a tenured professor of law
at Georgetown University Law School,
I taught negotiations. We usually
worked with a number of issues in a ne-
gotiation at the same time. However,
the easiest compromise to reach is one
that involves a number. The number
the President clings to is $5 billion. I
can think of endless ways—and I am
sure every Member can—to com-
promise that number.
So in the name of a mounting num-
ber of Americans who are beginning to
feel the consequences of the shutdown,
though they are not Federal employ-
ees—not to mention the Federal em-
ployees themselves—I am asking even
for my side to make a more concerted
effort to reach an agreeable number,
even though the polls show that the
American people are with the Demo-
crats on this issue.
As a suggestion, I ask that the Demo-
crats appoint a subcommittee and that
the administration do the same to sit
down and hammer out an acceptable
compromise.
For more than two centuries now, we
have operated under a separation-of-
powers government to make tyrannical
rule nearly impossible. Even Trump is
hesitating to declare an emergency to
get his border wall. That throws the
ball in our camp, we who are Demo-
crats who control this House. I ask
that we accept it, use it, run with it,
and settle this matter now.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I would like to make the gen-
tleman from Maryland aware that I
have no further speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker,
may I inquire as to how much time re-
mains?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland has 8 minutes
remaining.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I just want to asso-
ciate myself with the words of the gen-
tlewoman from the District of Colum-
bia. So often what we see is our Fed-
eral employees often being criticized
when it came to trying to find money
when we have budgetary problems. It
seems that there is an effort to con-
stantly go in to the Federal employees
and make them pay. And they do all
kinds of jobs. I agree with the gentle-
woman. This bill does not solve the
problem with the shutdown.
b 1300
At least I hope that we are sending a
message to them that we care about
them and that we understand and we
feel their pain.
I agree with the gentlewoman. In
some kind of way, we ought to be able
to move from where we are to getting
folks back to work, an independent
group looking at, perhaps, the issues
that confront the compromisers—that
is, looking at this wall—and deal with
that at some other time. But we need
to get people back to work.
People are in pain. They are feeling
it. Not only are the employees feeling
it, but all the people who are coming
into the various parks or whatever,
who simply want to have a nice day,
who simply want to have some reason-
able entertainment that does not cost
them a lot by going for a walk in the
park; for getting the services that are
needed; for making sure that our air-
planes do not have folks on them car-
rying guns.
These folks who we saw in the air-
port over the weekend, they are the
same ones who are coming in day after
day and working for no pay. We are
better than that, and I am praying that
we will get this issue resolved.
The gentlewoman from the District
of Columbia talked about the number
of people who she has in her district
who are Federal employees. We, in
Maryland, have over 100,000 Federal
employees, and we have so many people
who work for the Federal Government
through contracting. There must be a
way to get this done.
I am going to close, but I will give
the gentlewoman her opportunity, and
then I will come back, Madam Speaker.
Therefore, I reserve the balance of my
time.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I thank my colleagues who worked
very hard on this bill: Congressman
MEADOWS, Congresswoman NORTON,
Congressman SENSENBRENNER, and
Congresswoman JACKSON LEE. All of
them worked in a strong, bipartisan
way to make this happen.
H.R. 135 is a simple, straightforward
measure that would make a handful of
changes to require the Federal agen-
cies’ equal employment opportunity
programs conform to the model stand-
ards set forth by the Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Commission and to
strengthen accountability.
This bill has had overwhelming bi-
partisan support from the entire House
of Representatives for years, and I urge
the Senate to pass this measure as
soon as possible.
As I close, I do not want to address
extraneous issues that have previously
arisen regarding this measure in the
Senate Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs Committee. I want to be
crystal clear that I believe that the su-
pervisors who engage in discriminatory
or retaliatory actions must be held ac-
countable. However, this can be accom-
plished without curtailing any existing
due process rights for Federal employ-
ees, and I will continue to oppose ef-
forts to roll back due process rights.
Madam Speaker, I urge the House to
vote in favor of this bill, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise
in support of H.R. 135 the ‘‘Federal Employee
Anti-Discrimination Act of 2019,’’ which will
strengthen the policies governing federal
agencies’ management of Equal Employment
Opportunity (EEO) programs by amending the
Notification and Federal Employee Anti-
discrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002.
Equal Employment Opportunity programs
enable federal employees or applicants who
believe they have been the victims of discrimi-
nation to file a complaint about the alleged
discrimination.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H562 January 15, 2019
I support this legislation because it works to
expand accountability within the federal gov-
ernment as federal agencies take appropriate
disciplinary action against federal employees
who have been found to have committed dis-
criminatory or retaliatory acts.
In 2012, federal employees and applicants
for employment filed nearly 16,000 EEO com-
plaints; most of which were handled accord-
ingly, but some federal agencies still have not
met the standards of a model EEO program
set forth by the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission (EEOC).
This legislation would require each federal
agency to ensure its EEO program is not
under the control of the agency’s human re-
sources or general counsel offices and that
the head of the program reports directly to the
agency head.
Madam Speaker, this bill would also expand
the notifications that agencies are required to
provide when discrimination is found to have
occurred, and it would require agencies to
track and report whether necessary discipli-
nary action has been taken.
Additionally, H.R. 135 would prohibit poli-
cies, forms, or agreements that prohibit or re-
strict an employee from disclosing to Con-
gress, the Office of Special Counsel, or any
Inspector General any information that relates
to any violation of any law, rule, or regulation
or any instance of waste, fraud, or abuse.
Fighting discrimination is a commitment the
federal government needs to make, beginning
with their own employees at home and
abroad.
Men, women, of every race and religion de-
serve the same representation and protection
under the United States government, and in
order to fulfill the requirements of their job to
the best of their ability, their right to not be
discriminated against needs to be upheld.
In 2013, Texas employers received almost
10 percent of the nation’s federal employment
discrimination, harassment and retaliation alle-
gations, at about 9,000 total charges.
I support this legislation because I support
the rights of federal employees to feel safe
and represented in their working environ-
ments, and obtain the correct protection they
desire and deserve.
For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to
join me in supporting H.R. 135 to strengthen
the policies surrounding work place discrimina-
tion in the federal government.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.
CUMMINGS) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 135.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, on

The yeas and nays were ordered.

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

FEDERAL INTERN PROTECTION
ACT OF 2019
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
move to suspend the rules and pass the
bill (H.R. 136) to amend title 5, United
States Code, to protect unpaid interns
in the Federal Government from work-
place harassment and discrimination,
and for other purposes.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 136
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Federal In-
tern Protection Act of 2019’’.
SEC. 2. PROHIBITED PERSONNEL PRACTICES.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 2302 of title 5,
United States Code, is amended by adding at
the end the following:
‘‘(g)(1) All protections afforded to an em-
ployee under subparagraphs (A), (B), and (D)
of subsection (b)(1) shall be afforded, in the
same manner and to the same extent, to an
intern and an applicant for internship.
‘‘(2) For purposes of the application of this
subsection, a reference to an employee shall

3111(c)(1) of title 5, United States Code, is
amended by inserting ‘‘section 2302(g) (relat-
ing to prohibited personnel practices),’’ be-
fore ‘‘chapter 81’’.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS) and the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.
FOXX) each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Maryland.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous mate-
rials on H.R. 136.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland?
There was no objection.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
The bill before us, the Federal Intern
Protection Act, would close a loophole
in Federal employment law that cur-
rently leaves unpaid interns open to
discrimination and sexual harassment
without any legal recourse.
The Committee on Oversight and Re-
form has held multiple hearings about
sexual harassment and retaliation oc-
curring in various Federal agencies, in-
cluding the Environmental Protection
Agency, the National Park Service,
and the Forest Service.
During these hearings, both my Re-
publican colleagues and I expressed our
disgust at the exploitation of female
employees and interns, and we de-
manded action to prevent future abuse.
Unfortunately, the act of harassing
unpaid interns on the basis of race, re-
ligion, age, or sex is not currently pro-
hibited by Federal law. Under existing
law, victims rely on the discretion and
integrity of managers to prevent this
behavior.
One witness who testified before our
committee told us that managers do
not always address the problem as they
should and may actually be, in fact, a
part of the problem.
The witness stated: ‘‘Even after find-
ing out about the numerous harass-
ment victims, the direct reporting
manager continued to feed the harasser
a steady diet of young women.’’
We saw at our hearings that allowing
this kind of behavior to go unchecked
can have serious consequences on the
lives and careers of those who are in-
terested in government service. Our
bill will give Federal interns the same
protections already provided to Fed-
eral employees.
This measure passed the House in
previous Congresses, and I urge my col-
leagues to join me in ensuring that this
legislation passes our Chamber once
again today.
I want to speak to the Congressional
Intern Protection Act, related legisla-
tion I introduced, which gives protec-
tions to congressional interns and
which was passed at the end of the last
Congress as a part of a package of re-
forms to the Congressional Account-
ability Act.
This is a great start, but more must
be done. Along with the Federal Intern
Protection Act, I introduced the Un-
paid Intern Protection Act, which
would provide these protections to in-
terns in the private sector.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 136, the Federal Intern
Protection Act. The Federal Govern-
ment is well served by interns who pro-
vide invaluable assistance to agencies.
Many of the staff here in Congress
itself began as interns, and I know my
office, over the years, has been ex-
tremely well served by interns who
have gone on to become a real credit
where they have found themselves em-
ployed.
Interns work alongside career Fed-
eral employees, helping to conduct
agency business on behalf of the Amer-
ican people. Federal internship pro-
grams help agencies identify and de-
velop the next generation of Federal
employees. In exchange, interns gain
valuable work experience.
Many interns are students who ben-
efit from the opportunity to develop
experience in a field they might hope
to enter upon graduation. Some stu-
dents even receive credit they can
apply at their institution of learning.
Unfortunately, there are no existing
provisions in Federal law that protect
interns working at Federal agencies
from harassment or discrimination.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H563
January 15, 2019
In O’Connor v. Davis, the United
States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit upheld the district court deci-
sion, finding an intern could not bring
sexual harassment claims under Fed-
eral law. The court reasoned that the
intern was not an employee and she
was, therefore, not covered by existing
law.
The court concluded that: ‘‘It is for
Congress, if it should choose to do so,
. . . to provide a remedy.’’
H.R. 136 provides the remedy. The
Federal Intern Protection Act ensures
interns working for the Federal Gov-
ernment receive the same protections
as employees. The bill prohibits dis-
crimination based on race, color, reli-
gion, sex, national origin, age, or dis-
ability for interns working at Federal
agencies.
Discrimination disadvantages eager-
to-work interns, but discrimination
also disadvantages Federal agencies by
interfering with the selection of the
best intern candidate.
I thank my colleague from Maryland,
Mr. CUMMINGS, for his sponsorship of
this bill and for his leadership and
commitment to protecting interns who
work for the Federal Government, and
I urge all Members to support the bill.
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of
the bill, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, H.R. 136 is a com-
monsense measure that would close a
loophole in the Federal employment
law that currently leaves the youngest,
most vulnerable group of our constitu-
ents open to harassment and discrimi-
nation without legal recourse to pro-
tect them.
This bipartisan bill passed our Cham-
ber in the last Congress, reflecting bi-
partisan agreement that we need to so-
lidify protections for Federal interns
and ensure they have the same protec-
tions already provided to Federal em-
ployees.
As I close, I want to be clear that
this bill responds to very real instances
of interns being victimized within the
Federal Government. Without this bill,
victims will be forced to continue to
rely on the discretion and integrity of
the managers to prevent this behavior.
I still say we can do better than that,
so I urge the House to join me today in
supporting this measure. I look for-
ward to working with my Senate col-
leagues to move this bill through the
Senate and, finally, get it to the Presi-
dent’s desk.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Madam Speaker,
today I will cast my vote in favor of H.R. 136,
The Federal Intern Protection Act of 2019. But
I will do so with the concern that it does not
go far enough. This bill, for all of the improved
protections it does afford, fails to provide to
Federal interns with the basic safeguards
against harassment that are common to their
counterparts in corporate America.
Having spent 16 years as a CEO of compa-
nies ranging from 10–200 employees, I know
this subject well. In my private-sector work-
places, our harassment policies protected paid
and unpaid employees from harassment as
this bill does. But those policies did not stop
there. We also prohibited harassment against
any contractors or suppliers who were on our
premises or who were working with our staff in
environments that were reasonably considered
to be work related—for example, at an off-site
dinner meeting.
We then went further still and required that
any contractors or suppliers who required ac-
cess to our facilities also agree to be bound
by those policies. We did not do this out of
legal obligation, but because it made our
workplaces and employees safer and more
productive.
I respectfully submit that we should do the
same in this body. To be sure, it may be dif-
ficult for us to obligate anyone in our offices to
be fully bound by our policies. But surely we
can provide a safer workspace not only for our
paid and unpaid employees but also for com-
mittee staff, and staff from other Members’ of-
fices, as well as visitors.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.
CUMMINGS) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 136.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise
and extend their remarks and include
extraneous material on the measure
before us today.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland?
There was no objection.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in
strong support of H.R. 202, the Inspec-
tor General Access Act. I thank Rep-
resentatives RICHMOND, HICE, and
LYNCH for the bipartisan manner in
which they worked on this very impor-
tant bill in the last Congress.
The Inspector General Access Act
would allow the inspector general of
the Department of Justice to inves-
tigate allegations of misconduct by De-
partment attorneys. The IG is statu-
torily independent and currently has
the authority to investigate other DOJ
personnel.
The IG is barred from pursuing ap-
propriate investigations into attorneys
at the Department. Under current law,
the authority to investigate attorneys
is restricted to the Office of Profes-
sional Responsibility within DOJ. OPR
is not statutorily independent, and its
head is not confirmed by the Senate
like the IG is. Treating attorneys dif-
ferently from other personnel is simply
unfair.
Michael Horowitz, the inspector gen-
eral at the Department of Justice, re-
cently testified before our Committee
on Oversight and Reform, and this is
what he said: ‘‘This bifurcated jurisdic-
tion creates a system where mis-
conduct by FBI agents and other DOJ
law enforcement officers is conducted
by a statutorily-independent IG ap-
pointed by the President and confirmed
by the Senate, while misconduct by
DOJ prosecutors is investigated by a
component head who is appointed by
the Department’s leadership and who
lacks statutory independence. There is
no principled reason for treating mis-
conduct by Federal prosecutors dif-
ferently than misconduct by DOJ law
enforcement agents.’’
H.R. 202 would not prohibit OPR from
investigating attorneys. It would sim-
ply add the ability to investigate attor-
neys, when appropriate to the IG’s au-
thority, an additional layer of account-
ability.
Empowering IGs has been and should
continue to be a nonpartisan issue. The
Committee on Oversight and Reform
relies on the work of IGs. We strongly
support efforts to help them do their
jobs effectively and efficiently.
A bill identical to the one before us
passed the House on a voice vote in the
last Congress. I urge my colleagues to
continue their support for IGs by sup-
porting the Inspector General Access
Act.

H564 January 15, 2019
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-

Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I

Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-

perform a critical oversight function
with regard to misconduct at their re-
spective agencies. This committee, the

have timely and complete access to all
the information they need to fulfill
their oversight and investigative func-
tions.
In continuance of that mission, H.R.
202 removes an unnecessary and out-
dated statutory hurdle that prevents
the inspector general from inves-
tigating certain misconduct at the De-
partment of Justice, DOJ.
Current law requires the DOJ IG to
refer allegations of misconduct by De-
partment attorneys to the Office of
Professional Responsibility, or OPR,
rather than initiate an investigation
himself. The OPR existed prior to the
statutory creation of the DOJ IG in
1988. At the time DOJ IG was created,
OPR retained the specific authority.
H.R. 202 seeks to harmonize the De-
partment of Justice IG’s investigative
authority with the rest of the Federal
inspectors general who are not simi-
larly restricted. Congress and this com-
mittee have consistently supported the
need for independent and transparent
oversight of Federal agencies and pro-
grams. The current bifurcation of in-
vestigative authority at DOJ is incon-
sistent with this committee’s history
of supporting the notion of an
unencumbered IG.
The DOJ IG is not without its own
oversight. The IG is confirmed by the
Senate, accountable to the public, and
is only removable by the President
after notification to Congress. Further,
the IG has statutory reporting obliga-
tions to both agency leadership and
Congress.
The OPR, in contrast, lacks such
independence from the agency it is ob-
ligated to investigate. The director of
OPR is selected and appointed by the
attorney general, answers to the attor-
ney general, and can be removed or dis-
ciplined only by the attorney general.
The IG’s independence is critical to the
value of their work.
Also critical to the value of the IG’s
work is transparency. The IG main-
tains transparency by publishing its re-
ports on a public website. The website
also contains information about the
IG’s operations and functions and a full
archive of completed and ongoing
work. This standard of transparency
does not apply to OPR. Adverse find-
ings by OPR against a DOJ lawyer are
subject to review by the Department’s
leadership and can be overruled by the
Department’s leadership without any
transparency.
It is important to note that this divi-
sion of authority is a unique situation
amongst the Federal IG community.
The need for this legislation has also
been discussed in multiple hearings be-
fore the Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee and in reports by watchdog
groups.
The DOJ IG, Michael Horowitz, testi-
fied before the Oversight and Reform
Committee on the importance of elimi-
nating this discrepancy. Congress’s
own watchdog, the Government Ac-
countability Office, has issued reports
with recommendations to empower the
DOJ IG.
This is a good bill, Madam Speaker,
and I urge my colleagues to support it.
With that, I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the distinguished
gentlewoman from the State of Florida
(Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ).
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge
Congress to pass the Inspector General
Access Act of 2019. This act, I am
pleased to underscore, enjoys broad bi-
partisan support from this body now
and has in the past, but its approval is
more urgent now.
The actions, for example, of former
U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta have drawn
intense scrutiny since new revelations
surrounding a plea deal he offered to a
serial pedophile came to light.
Based on newly reported documents
and a group of brave women who came
forward to share their stories, it ap-
pears that Acosta gave a sweetheart
deal to a wealthy and well-connected
sex offender and hid it from his vic-
tims, some of whom were still in the
midst of coming forward.
Acosta is now the U.S. Secretary of
Labor, a position that handles work-
place harassment and sex trafficking
policies, yet he has refused to discuss
the new allegations. This IG Access
Act would explicitly allow the Depart-
ment of Justice Office of Inspector
General to investigate allegations of
such alleged misconduct.
It is a power that the IG office—as
has been pointed out by both the chair
and ranking member here, it is a power
that the IG office already has when it
comes to investigating allegations
made against any of the DOJ’s many
law enforcement agents, from the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation to the
U.S. Marshals Service.
This act has received broad bipar-
tisan support, both in successive Con-
gresses and from the Government Ac-
countability Office, but because of an
unusual carve-out, the DOJ’s inspector
general is believed to be, as the rank-
ing member said, the only Federal
agency that has no explicit power to
review the conduct of its own attor-
neys.
If professional misconduct was in-
volved in Acosta’s handling of Jeffrey
Epstein’s plea deal, potentially dozens
of victims of this connected multi-
millionaire have a right to know.
Acosta’s seemingly unethical decision
to drastically reduce the criminal pen-
alties against this vile sexual predator
and to shield his other coconspirators
is simply unacceptable.
The American people and the victims
of these horrific crimes deserve to
know why justice was not served in
this disturbing case, and the lack of
transparency still cloaking it is deeply
disturbing.
Giving the DOJ’s inspector general
more explicit and independent power to
pull back the cloak of secrecy on
Acosta’s sweetheart deal goes to the
heart of transparency and account-
ability that this office stands for and
that this bill would insist upon.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, again, I urge the adoption of
this bill, and I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
On November 29, 2018, DOJ Inspector
General Michael Horowitz sent a letter
to the Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee in support of the Inspector Gen-
eral Access Act, and this is what he
wrote: ‘‘Providing the OIG with author-
ity to exercise jurisdiction in attorney
professional misconduct cases would
enhance the public’s confidence in the
outcomes of these investigations and
provide the OIG with the same author-
ity as every other inspector general.’’
I include Mr. Horowitz’s letter in the

DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN AND RANKING MEMBER
CUMMINGS: I write to express my strong sup-
port for H.R. 3154, the ‘‘Inspector General Ac-
cess Act of 2017’’ (Access Act), which your
Committee approved unanimously on Sep-
tember 27, 2018. The Access Act would amend
the Inspector General Act (IG Act) to pro-
vide the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office
of the Inspector General (OIG) with author-
ity to investigate allegations of misconduct
against DOJ attorneys for their actions as
lawyers, just as the OIG has authority under
the IG Act to investigate allegations of mis-
conduct made against any non-lawyer in the
Department, including law enforcement
agents at the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Adminis-
tration (DEA), the Bureau of Alcohol, To-
bacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and
the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS). Cur-
rently, under Section 8E of the Inspector
General Act, the OIG does not have the au-
thority to investigate allegations of mis-
conduct made against DOJ attorneys acting
in their capacity as lawyers; this role is re-
served exclusively for the Department’s Of-
fice of Professional Responsibility (OPR).
The Access Act has received broad, bipar-
tisan support over successive Congresses be-
cause it promotes independent oversight,
transparency, and accountability within
DOJ and for all of its employees. For these

same reasons, in 1994, the then-General Ac-
counting Office, now the Government Ac-
countability Office (GAO), issued a report
that found that preventing the OIG from in-
vestigating attorney misconduct was incon-
sistent with the independence and account-
ability that Congress envisioned under the
IG Act.
The OIG has long questioned this carve-out
because OPR lacks statutory independence
and does not regularly release its reports and
conclusions to the public. Moreover, to our
knowledge, the DOJ Inspector General is the
only Inspector General in the entire federal
government that does not have the authority
to investigate alleged professional mis-
conduct by attorneys who work in the agen-
cy it oversees. Providing the OIG with au-
thority to exercise jurisdiction in attorney
professional misconduct cases would enhance
the public’s confidence in the outcomes of
these investigations and provide the OIG
with the same authority as every other In-
spector General.
Alleged professional misconduct by DOJ
prosecutors, like any alleged misconduct by
DOJ agents, should be subject to statutorily
independent oversight:
Over fifteen years ago, the Department and
Congress recognized the importance of statu-
torily independent OIG oversight over all
DOJ law enforcement components (FBI,
DEA, USMS, and ATF) when Attorney Gen-
eral Ashcroft authorized the OIG to conduct
additional law enforcement oversight in 2001
and Congress legislated it in 2002. Yet, alle-
gations against Department prosecutors for
professional misconduct continue to be han-
dled exclusively by OPR. As a result, pres-
ently, if an allegation of misconduct is made
against the FBI Director, it is reviewed by
the OIG; by contrast, if an allegation of pro-
fessional misconduct is made against the At-
torney General, it is handled by OPR, a De-
partmental component that the Attorney
General supervises.
The rationale supporting independent over-
sight for alleged misconduct by law enforce-
ment applies with equal force to alleged
wrongdoing by federal prosecutors, regard-
less of the nature of the alleged misconduct.
There is no principled reason to have two
standards of oversight at DOJ—one for fed-
eral agents, who are subject to statutorily
independent and transparent oversight by
the OIG, and one for federal prosecutors, who
are not for allegations of professional mis-
conduct. This is particularly true given the
extraordinary power that Department law-
yers have to charge individuals with crimes,
to seek incarceration, and to pursue the sei-
zure of assets and property.
The OIG’s independence, established by
statutory authorities and protections, facili-
tates objective and credible investigations of
misconduct allegations, as well as unbiased
reports that identify and make useful rec-
ommendations for improving the Depart-
ment. The OIG is headed by a Senate-con-
firmed Inspector General who can only be re-
moved by the President, with prior notice to
Congress. The OIG’s statutory independence
is bolstered by the OIG’s dual obligation to
report findings and concerns both to the At-
torney General and to Congress. The inde-
pendent OIG is able to make critical inves-
tigative and audit findings without fear of
reprisal.
Conversely, OPR has no statutory inde-
pendence or protections. The OPR Counsel is
appointed by and answers to the Attorney
General, and can be removed or disciplined
by the Attorney General. Although a Novem-
ber 27, 2018 letter from DOJ’s Office of Legis-
lative Affairs (OLA) on H.R. 3154 states that
‘‘OPR has always acted independently,’’ it
does not point to any protections, statutory
or otherwise, that exist to ensure OPR’s
independence from the Attorney General,
nor has DOJ proposed strengthening OPR’s
independence by adding such protections. In-
deed, the letter fails to explain or even ad-
dress why DOJ believes it is better to have a
non-statutorily independent entity handle
attorney professional misconduct cases rath-
er than a statutorily independent organiza-
tion, as is the case for law enforcement pro-
fessional misconduct allegations.
The OIG’s independent and transparent
oversight enhances the public’s confidence in
the DOD’s programs and improves its oper-
ations:
In addition to independence, the OIG con-
siders transparency a crucial component of
its oversight mission. With limited excep-
tions, the OIG ensures that the public is
aware of the results of our work. The major-
ity of our reports are posted on our public
website at the time of release to ensure that
Congress and the public are informed of our
findings, in a comprehensive and timely
manner. The OIG, consistent with the IG
Act, publishes on our website summaries of
investigations resulting in findings of ad-
ministrative misconduct by senior govern-
ment employees and in matters of public in-
terest even when the subject is not pros-
ecuted. We post such summaries without
identifying the investigative subject con-
sistent with the legal requirements under
the Privacy Act. Because of this commit-
ment to transparency, there are currently
hundreds of OIG reports, audits, and reviews
posted on our web site. There are also sum-
maries of dozens of OIG investigative reports
posted, including recent reports involving
significant misconduct by senior DOJ offi-
cials.
In contrast, there are currently only a
total of five reports (other than annual re-
ports) posted on OPR’s website. Four of
those five reports are from 2008 and were the
result of OPR’s joint work with the OIG, and
which the OIG posted on our website con-
sistent with the IG Act and our practice. The
fifth report was completed by OPR in 2013
and only released in 2015 in response to a
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.
Moreover, although the OLA letter states
that ‘‘OPR discloses a substantial amount of
information about its work and findings in
its annual report,’’ this information is not
reported in a timely or comprehensive man-
ner. Congress and the public only find out
about some, but not necessarily all, of OPR’s
work when it issues an annual report.
An example of this dichotomy can be found
in a case involving an Oregon lawyer who
was arrested by the FBI and wrongly impris-
oned after mismatched fingerprints linked
him to the 2004 bombing at a Madrid train
station. The OIG investigated the allegations
of FBI agent misconduct, while the Depart-
ment’s OPR investigated the allegations of
attorney misconduct. This bifurcation led to
inconsistent treatment. The OIG report on
the actions of the FBI agents was published
on the OIG’s website, but OPR did not pub-
lish the report on the conduct of the DOJ at-
torneys who were involved in the same case.
Transparency ensures greater account-
ability, and sends an important deterrent
message to other Department employees.
The credibility of the Department’s discipli-
nary process is inevitably reduced when the
responsible component operates under the di-
rection of the Department’s senior leader-
ship and is not subject to public scrutiny be-
cause of limited transparency.
The OIG has demonstrated its excellence in
reviewing complex legal and factual issues,
including employee ethics and misconduct
matters:
Over the past 30 years, the OIG has shown
that it is capable of fair and independent
oversight of the DOJ. The jurisdictional lim-
itation of Section 8E(b)(3) is an unnecessary
historical vestige of the fact that OPR was
in existence prior to the statutory creation
of the OIG in 1988. Those who unsuccessfully
tried in 2002 to forestall Congress from pro-
viding the OIG with oversight of alleged mis-
conduct by FBI and DEA agents contended
that those cases required specialized exper-
tise—just like the Department argues cur-
rently that prosecutorial oversight requires
specialized expertise—and that argument
was roundly rejected and has proven to be
entirely without merit. The decision by Con-
gress to extend OIG jurisdiction in 2002 to
encompass misconduct by FBI and DEA
agents has allowed for significant and impor-
tant oversight of DOJ’s law enforcement op-
erations, and has had significant positive im-
pact on the integrity of those agencies’ oper-
ations.
The OIG has consistently demonstrated
our ability to handle complex legal and fac-
tual issues related to our misconduct re-
views, including those involving FBI and
DEA agents as well as, on occasion, ethics
issues involving DOJ lawyers. In addition to
our recent investigation of the FBI’s actions
prior to the 2016 presidential election, which
involved evaluating the professional conduct
by FBI agents, FBI lawyers, and FBI senior
officials, we have investigated the FBI’s ac-
tions involving its former agent Robert
Hanssen, the FBI’s activities related to
James ‘‘Whitey’’ Bulger, the DEA’s oversight
of its confidential informant program, the
DEA and other components’ handling of sex-
ual misconduct and harassment cases, the
operation of the FBI laboratory, ATF’s ac-
tions involving Operation Fast and Furious,
and the FBI’s use of its national security au-
thorities (National Security Letters, Patriot
Act Section 215, FISA Amendment Act Sec-
tion 702).
Each of those and many other reviews re-
sulted in independent and transparent find-
ings by the OIG, and resulted in changes to
Department operations that enhanced their
effectiveness and thereby increased the
public’s confidence in those programs. More-
over, OIGs throughout the government, in-
cluding at the Department of Homeland Se-
curity and the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission, have authority to investigate mis-
conduct allegations made against attorneys
at those agencies and they have dem-
onstrated that they are fully capable of deal-
ing with such matters covering a wide range
of complex legal issues. The DOJ OIG is the
only OIG, to our knowledge, that is barred
by the IG Act from reviewing misconduct by
lawyers within the agency it oversees.
The Access Act would provide the OIG with
oversight over Department lawyers in a
manner that is entirely consistent with its
oversight authority over Department non-at-
torneys:
The present oversight system that applies
to allegations made against any DOJ non-
lawyer, as provided for in the IG Act and De-
partment regulations, is precisely the over-
sight mechanism that the Access Act seeks
to apply to Department lawyers. Specifi-
cally, under the current system for DOJ non-
lawyers, all non-frivolous misconduct allega-
tions must be provided to the OIG for the
OIG’s review and determination as to wheth-
er it is of the type and nature that warrants
and necessitates independent OIG investiga-
tion. Given the OIG’s limited resources, the
OIG handles only those allegations that war-
rant an independent OIG investigation, and
therefore the OIG returns routine and less
serious misconduct allegations to Depart-
ment components, such as the FBI’s Inspec-
tions Division and the DEA’s OPR, for their
handling and investigation. For those mat-
ters that the OIG retains, when the OIG com-
pletes its investigation, it sends its report to

the component so that it can adjudicate the
OIG’s findings and take disciplinary action,
as appropriate. The Access Act creates a
similar practice, by maintaining the Depart-
ment’s OPR to handle misconduct allega-
tions that do not require independent out-
side review as determined by the OIG, much
as the internal affairs offices at the FBI,
DEA, ATF, and USMS remain in place today.
We are unaware of any claims by Depart-
ment leaders that this approach has resulted
in ‘‘different investigative standards,’’
‘‘decrease[d] efficiency,’’ or ‘‘inconsistent ap-
plication’’ of legal standards. There is no evi-
dence that it has impacted the components
‘‘ability to successfully defend any signifi-
cant discipline decision before the Merit Sys-
tems Protection Board.’’ Yet this parade of
horribles is precisely what the OLA letter
claims will occur if attorneys are treated in
the same manner as Special Agents and non-
attorneys at the Department, rather than
continuing to receive the special oversight
treatment granted to them under the cur-
rent carve-out provision under the IG Act.
This argument is meritless. Indeed, the dis-
ciplinary processes at the FBI and the DEA
have substantially improved since the OIG
obtained statutory oversight authority over
those components in 2002, in significant part
due to the greater transparency and account-
ability that has resulted from the OIG’s
oversight.
I very much appreciate your strong sup-
port for my Office and for Inspectors General
throughout the federal government. If you
have further questions, please feel free to

Sincerely,
MICHAEL E. HOROWITZ,
Inspector General.
Mr. CUMMINGS. On December 25,
2018, the New York Times editorial
board wrote: ‘‘It makes sense to give
Mr. Horowitz’s office oversight author-
ity over the activities of Justice De-
partment lawyers—as other inspectors
general have over lawyers in their de-
partments. Doing so would aid the
cause of justice and strengthen the
public’s trust in an institution charged
with upholding it.’’
On December 30, 2018, the Miami Her-
ald also published an editorial in sup-
port of the Inspector General Access
Act. I hope the Senate will follow the
quick and bipartisan action this body
will take today when we pass this bill
so that we can get it to the President’s
desk for his signature as soon as pos-
sible.
With that, Madam Speaker, I urge all
of our colleagues to vote in favor of
this very important legislation, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker, I want to
thank Chairman CUMMINGS for bringing this
important legislation to the Floor.
In 2005, shortly after Hurricane Katrina, a
group of New Orleans police officers opened
fire on a handful of unarmed African American
civilians walking across Danziger Bridge, kill-
ing two and injuring four.
This occurred during the heart of the Hurri-
cane Katrina aftermath and left deep scars on
our community.
Years later five officers were convicted on a
variety of charges for these actions.
However, their convictions were vacated in
2013 due to misconduct by Department of
Justice prosecutors.
In my efforts to find out what happened and
why, and to also get transparency for my con-
stituents, I received a DOJ report that was
heavily redacted and missing crucial facts.
I also learned that the DOJ Inspector Gen-
eral lacked the authority to investigate those
actions.
The DOJ was being left to investigate itself
in situations like this and the American people
were being left without the full story.
That ultimately led to the victims and their
families never receiving the full measure of
justice they were owed.
This bill grants the Office of the Inspector
General for the Department of Justice the au-
thority to investigate alleged misconduct com-
mitted by Department of Justice attorneys
when they act in their capacity as lawyers.
Currently, the OIG has jurisdiction to review
alleged misconduct by non-lawyers in the
DOJ, but the DOJ’s own Office of Professional
Responsibility exercises jurisdiction over al-
leged misconduct committed by DOJ attorneys
when they are litigating, investigating, or pro-
viding legal advice.
From fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year
2013, Office of Professional Responsibility
documented more than 650 infractions, includ-
ing allegations that federal attorneys inten-
tionally misled courts and alleged abuses of
the grand jury or indictment process.
In most of these matters—more than 400—
OPR categorized the violations at the more
severe end of the scale: recklessness or inten-
tional misconduct as opposed to error or poor
judgment.
However, the DOJ does not make public the
names of attorneys who acted improperly or
the defendants whose cases were affected. As
a result, the DOJ, its lawyers, and the internal
watchdog office itself are protected from
meaningful public scrutiny and accountability.
This simple change in jurisdiction will ensure
that people facing federal charges get a fair
day in court and that the U.S. government is
properly represented in disputes with corpora-
tions where taxpayer dollars are on the line.
We must ensure that innocent people are
not wrongly convicted and sent to prison, and
that tainted cases do not cause convictions of
guilty parties to be thrown out.
With stakes as high as these, it is essential
that DOJ attorneys be held to highest possible
standards of accountability.
While the Office of Professional Responsibil-
ity’s investigations and actions are notorious
for their secrecy, the OIG’s independence and
transparency will enhance the public’s con-
fidence in DOJ’s operations.
For these reasons, and for the victims of the
Danziger Bridge shootings and their families, I
encourage my colleagues to support this com-
monsense legislation.

Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I

The All-American Flag Act is a com-
monsense bill that all Members can
support. It would require that all Fed-
eral agencies purchase American flags
that are manufactured right here in
the United States using materials
grown or produced in the United
States.
Under current law, the requirement
applies only to the Departments of De-
fense and Veterans Affairs. It should be
extended to all Federal agencies.
As under current law, the bill would
provide certain limited exceptions and
allow agencies to purchase American
flags made elsewhere if they are not
available in sufficient quantity or
quality from American manufacturers.
I urge support of this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Madam Speaker, H.R. 113 is a bipar-
tisan bill to ensure government agen-
cies buy United States flags made only
from 100 percent American-made mate-
rials.
Most Americans may think American
flags purchased with taxpayer money
for the government are made here at
home by Americans using only U.S.
materials. Surprisingly, this is not a
uniform requirement in current Fed-
eral acquisition laws and regulations.
Requirements in current law are in-
consistent when it comes to the con-
tent of American flags purchased by
executive agencies. The Department of
Defense and the military departments
generally are required to buy American
flags made entirely of U.S. materials,
but civilian agencies are currently per-
mitted to buy flags that are manufac-
tured in the U.S. consisting of only 51
percent American-made material, or
sometimes even less than that.
This bill brings all executive agen-
cies under a single rule about the con-
tent of American flags bought by the
Federal Government. The bill har-
monizes and integrates this single rule
with existing laws that require domes-
tic content of U.S. flags purchased by
the government.
Rather than impose new rules and ex-
ceptions for DOD and civilian agency
flag purchases, the All-American Flag
Act recognizes and essentially adopts
current DOD requirements and excep-
tions. The bill makes those flag pur-
chasing standards permanent law and
applies the rules to civilian agencies
that buy U.S. flags.
H.R. 113 contains limited exceptions
that recognize practical realities such
as domestic nonavailability. These ex-
ceptions reflect those contained in cur-
rent law governing DOD purchase of
textiles, including U.S. flags.
I thank Representative BUSTOS and
the many cosponsors who are leading
this effort to honor America’s greatest
symbol of freedom, and I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill.
Madam Speaker, I have no further
speakers. I urge adoption of the bill,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I think this is a
very important bill. The American flag
is so near and dear to so many people,
and, quite often, folks think that it is
being manufactured here in the United
States and being manufactured with
materials grown here; but the fact is,
quite often, that is not the case. So I
think it is only fitting that, when we
wave that flag and when we salute that
flag, we know that it has been pro-
duced here in our country.
Madam Speaker, I urge all of our col-
leagues to vote in favor of this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. SE-
WELL of Alabama). The question is on
the motion offered by the gentleman
from Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS) that
the House suspend the rules and pass
the bill, H.R. 113.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

to the Federal Chief Information Offi-
cer, and it would require direct report-
ing of that individual to the Director of
the Office of Management and Budget.
It is very, very important.
Second, it would establish the posi-
tion of Federal Chief Information Secu-
rity Officer, who would report to the
Federal CIO and assist OMB in the cy-
bersecurity efforts.
Finally, this very important bill
would require the Federal CIO to sub-
mit a proposal on consolidating IT
across Federal agencies, especially
smaller agencies, through the use of
shared services.
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members
to vote in favor of this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I yield such time as he may
consume to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. HURD), the chief sponsor of this
legislation.
Mr. HURD of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I thank the distinguished gentlewoman
for yielding time to me on this impor-
tant piece of legislation.
It should come as no surprise to any-
one in this Chamber that technology is
integrated into every facet of our daily
lives. We have come a long way since
the bill that established the role of the
Federal Chief Information Officer, the
E-Government Act, was originally
passed.
Less than 50 percent of the U.S. popu-
lation had home access to the internet
in 2001 when this was first passed. Now,
nearly every American has access to
the internet.
Just 62 percent of Americans had cell
phones when the original bill was
passed. Now, 95 percent of Americans
own cell phones, and 77 percent of
those are smartphones.
Mobile apps were nonexistent in 2002.
Today, over 2.2 million apps are avail-
able to consumers.
This bill recognizes how far tech-
nology has come. It codifies the posi-
tion of the Federal Chief Information
Officer and elevates the office to report
directly to the head of the Office of
Management and Budget.
The bill also establishes the role of
the Federal Chief Information Security
Officer, FCISO, who reports directly to
the Federal CIO and will lead OMB cy-
bersecurity efforts.
Empowering CIOs at the Federal
agencies is consistent with the prin-
ciples of one of the signature pieces of
legislation on IT reform, the Federal
IT Acquisition and Reform Act. The
Federal CIO should be treated no dif-
ferently. The Federal CIO must have
the statutory and organizational au-
thority to succeed, and this bill
achieves just that.
The bill does more than just rename
the office. It makes a clear statement
that the Federal CIO is in charge of co-
ordinating IT policy across the govern-
ment.
This bill passed the House last Con-
gress by a vote of 391–0, and I want to
thank my friends—Representatives
ROBIN KELLY, MARK MEADOWS, and
GERRY CONNOLLY—for their continued
support for this important initiative.
And I would like to thank Chairman
CUMMINGS and Ranking Member JOR-
DAN for making sure this important
piece of legislation comes to the floor.
I urge my colleagues to support this
bill.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Madam Speaker, I think this piece of
legislation is in the spirit of what Con-
gress needs to be doing in terms of up-
dating where we are in dealing with
technology and the need for adequate
oversight. This bill acknowledges that
Federal technology policy has not kept
up with the pace of technology integra-
tion by our Federal agencies.
This bill codifies the position of Fed-
eral CIO, emphasizing the importance
of the role to the formation of govern-
mentwide technology policy; and this
bill promotes organized, cost-efficient,
and secure technology used throughout
the Federal Government.
I would like to again thank the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. HURD) for in-
troducing this bill, along with the
many bipartisan supporters of it.
I urge my colleagues to support the
bill, vote for it, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I want to join my
colleague, Congresswoman FOXX, in
thanking Mr. HURD, Mr. CONNOLLY, and
Congresswoman KELLY for all the hard
work that they put into this legisla-
tion.
So often in our Congress, we are
blessed to have somebody like Mr.
HURD, who is very, very familiar with
these sometimes very complex issues,
and he brings just a reasonable ap-
proach to coming up with bipartisan
solutions to the problems that are fac-
ing our country and, just as signifi-
cant, bringing solutions that will pre-
vent problems from happening. So I
want to thank him for working so hard
on this, along with our colleagues, Mr.
CONNOLLY and Ms. KELLY.
Again, Madam Speaker, I urge all of
our Members to vote in favor of this
bill. It is a significant piece of legisla-
tion.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise in
support of H.R. 247, the Federal CIO Author-
ization Act of 2019, introduced by my col-
league, Congressman WILL HURD. I am happy
to co-sponsor this bill, which the House of
Representatives passed last year under sus-
pension of the rules.
This bill rebrands the Office of Electronic
Government at the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) and helps bring it into the 21st
century by renaming it the Office of the Fed-
eral Chief Information Officer. This new name
more appropriately characterizes the important
role the Office plays across the federal gov-
ernment in coordinating federal information
technology (IT) policy and providing guidance
to agencies. Currently, the Administrator of the
Office of Electronic Government is informally
called the Federal Chief Information Officer
(CIO), so it is long overdue for Congress to
make this change in statute, as this bill will do.
H.R. 247 will also rename the E-Government
Fund, the ‘‘Federal IT Fund’’ which better de-
scribes the purpose of the account.
More importantly, this bill establishes the
Federal Chief Information Security Office
(CISO) within the office of the Federal CIO.
The Federal CISO (pronounced SISSO) will
be appointed by the president and be respon-
sible for carrying out the cybersecurity duties
of the OMB Director, including the responsibil-
ities under the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA). This position was
created by President Obama to address the
increasing risk of cyberattacks and the need to
better protect our government’s data and infor-
mation across the federal government. How-
ever, it was not until a year and half into the
Trump Administration that the President
named Grant Schneider the permanent Fed-
eral CISO. My hope is that this position will
foster effective coordination of cybersecurity
policy across the federal government, pro-
viding agencies with guidance to secure their
IT systems and better defend against cyber-at-
tacks.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this bill.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.
CUMMINGS) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 247.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material
on H.R. 150, currently under consider-
ation.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland?
There was no objection.
b 1345
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, the Grant Reporting
Efficiency and Agreements Trans-
parency Act, introduced by Represent-
atives VIRGINIA FOXX and JIMMY
GOMEZ, would standardize reporting for
recipients of Federal grants and coop-
erative agreements.
Grant recipients often have to report
the same information in different ways
because Federal agencies do not use
the same forms or even the same terms
to describe required information.
Madam Speaker, I have often said
that the most important thing that we
must do in our lives is to operate in an
effective and efficient manner, and
that also includes this Congress.
Under this bill, the Director of the
Office of Management and Budget and
the Secretary of Health and Human
Services would be required to establish
governmentwide data standards for
grant reporting—again, efficiency and
effectiveness.
The bill would encourage OMB and
HHS to make the information that
grant recipients report fully searchable
and machine-readable. This would pro-
vide greater transparency into the
money spent on the grants because
spending data would be more usable.
The bill also would require that data
collected from grant recipients be pub-
lished on a single public portal.
Madam Speaker, I thank the distin-
guished gentlewoman, Ms. FOXX, for
working with Representative CONNOLLY
last Congress on the use of nonpropri-
etary identifiers for grants and grant-
ees. She, too, has worked in a hard, bi-
partisan way to bring solutions to
problems, to bring practical solutions
to problems.
The bill before us would allow this
issue to be carefully considered to en-
sure it is workable.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Madam Speaker, I appreciate very
much the comments made by my col-
league from Maryland and appreciate
particularly the emphasis this after-
noon that has been placed on bipar-
tisan bills and efficiency and effective-
ness in the Federal Government. Those
are values that should not be assigned
to any particular party. They are im-
portant for our country. They are im-
portant for what we do.
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as
he may consume to the gentleman
from Virginia (Mr. CLINE), who has
been waiting patiently to speak on this
bill.
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I am
pleased to rise in support of H.R. 150,
the Grant Reporting Efficiency and
Agreements Transparency Act.
Madam Speaker, in 1788, Patrick
Henry spoke at the Virginia Constitu-
tional Convention, where he said: ‘‘The
liberties of a people never were, nor
ever will be, secure when the trans-
actions of their rulers may be con-
cealed from them.’’
Transparency in government is an
important principle for the preserva-
tion of our Republic, and it has been a
priority for me during my tenure in the
Virginia House of Delegates, where I
was proud to sponsor legislation to put
the entire State budget in a searchable
online database.
In a similar vein, H.R. 150 would re-
quire that data on more than $600 bil-
lion in Federal grants be standardized
and published on a single online portal.
This is bipartisan legislation that
would modernize the way the Federal
Government does business by simpli-
fying grant reporting information into
a searchable, more manageable system.
Nonprofit, State and local govern-
ments, and small businesses will no
longer be forced to spend meaningful
work hours on filling out duplicative
paperwork.
In return, this will not only make
the grant reporting process more trans-
parent but will make it more efficient
and accessible to everyday Americans,
thus saving taxpayer dollars and help-
ing to fulfill the vision of another Vir-
ginian, Thomas Jefferson, who in his
first inaugural said: ‘‘A wise and frugal
government, which shall restrain men
from injuring one another, shall leave
them otherwise free to regulate their
own pursuits of industry and improve-
ment, and shall not take from the
mouth of labor the bread it has earned.
This is the sum of good government.’’
Madam Speaker, I support this bill
and urge its passage.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, we
have no further speakers, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the
gentleman from Virginia sharing his
comments with us, and I would like to
continue my remarks by thanking Rep-
resentative JIMMY GOMEZ for helping
author this piece of legislation, the
Grant Reporting Efficiency and Agree-
ments Transparency Act, or GREAT
Act.
Representative GOMEZ has been an
outstanding partner on this bipartisan
bill to create more transparency, effi-
ciency, and accountability in the Fed-
eral grant reporting process, and I
thank him for his hard work.
Madam Speaker, in 2017, the Federal
Government awarded $662.7 billion in
grants funding to State agencies, local
and Tribal governments, agencies, non-
profits, universities, and organizations.
This is a lot of hardworking tax dol-
lars, even in terms of Washington-
speak.
Within our Federal Government,
there are 26 agencies awarding Federal
grants, and all of them continue to rely
on outdated, burdensome, document-
based forms to collect and track grant
dollars. Society has moved into a new
age of information and technology, and
it is time that our government follows
suit.
The GREAT Act represents bipar-
tisan legislation to modernize the Fed-
eral grant reporting process. It does so
by mandating a standardized data
structure for information that recipi-
ents report to Federal agencies.
Unless the reporting requirements
for Federal grants are searchable, the
auditing process will continue to yield
waste and inefficiency at best, and po-
tentially fraud and abuse at worst.
Adopting a governmentwide open
data structure for all the information
grantees report will alleviate compli-
ance burdens; provide instant insights
for grantor agencies and Congress; and
enable easy access to data for over-
sight, analytics, and program evalua-
tion.
Digitizing and, therefore, automating
the reporting process would have a
twofold effect. First, it allows grantees
to maximize every dollar they receive

from the taxpayers to ensure it goes
back into communities, supporting
local businesses, organizations, and
education.
Lastly, the GREAT Act has received
broad support from an array of good
government groups. The coalition en-
dorsing the GREAT Act includes the
Bipartisan Policy Center, American
Association of Law Libraries, Amer-
ican Library Association, Association
of Government Accountants, Associa-
tion of Research Libraries, Data Coali-
tion, Demand Progress, Government
Accountability Project, Government
Information Watch, Grant Profes-
sionals Association, National Grants
Management Association, National
Taxpayers Union, Native American Fi-
nance Officers Association, the Project
on Government Oversight, R Street In-
stitute, Senior Executives Association,
and the Scholarly Publishing and Aca-
demic Resources Coalition.
In order to fix the way Federal
grants are reported, we must move
from a document-centric reporting sys-
tem to a data superhighway. I urge my
colleagues in the House and Senate to
support the GREAT Act and bring
grant reporting into the 21st century.
Madam Speaker, again, I urge my
colleagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, this bill is intended
to reduce the burden on applicants for
Federal grants by enabling a more
streamlined electronic process for com-
pleting grant applications. It would re-
quire HHS and OMB to develop uniform
data standards for common application
elements, such as the name and address
of the organization and the name of the
grant.
This will, hopefully, lead to the de-
velopment of a uniform grant applica-
tion that could be used across all Fed-
eral agencies. That would improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of the
grant application process immensely.
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members
to support this measure, and I hope
that the Senate will quickly pass it.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, we have no further speakers.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues again, along with Mr. CUM-
MINGS, to support this bill, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I again thank Ms.
FOXX for this very important legisla-
tion and all of the bipartisan efforts
that made it happen.
This bill and the others that we have
dealt with today, where there was such
great bipartisanship to get it done, I
hope that we will take these as a model
of what this Congress can do.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.
CUMMINGS) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 150.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, on

The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-

f
REJECTING WHITE NATIONALISM
AND WHITE SUPREMACY
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
move to suspend the rules and agree to
the resolution (H. Res. 41) rejecting
White nationalism and White suprem-
acy.
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion.
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 41
Whereas, on January 10, 2019, Representa-
tive Steve King was quoted as asking,
‘‘White nationalist, white supremacist, West-
ern civilization—how did that language be-
come offensive?’’;
Whereas a 2006 Federal Bureau of Intel-
ligence (FBI) assessment defined a White su-
premacist as follows: ‘‘White supremacists
believe that the white race is superior to all
other races and was created to rule them.
They view non-whites as subhuman and usu-
ally refer to them in derogatory terms’’;
Whereas the same 2006 FBI intelligence as-
sessment defined a White nationalist as fol-
lows: ‘‘To be a white nationalist is to be pro-
white. The domestic white nationalist move-
ment seeks to promote, honor, and defend
the white race. They believe the white race
is under attack from Jewish interests that
dominate the government (referred to as the
Zionist Occupied Government, or ZOG), the
media, banking, and entertainment indus-
tries and act to the detriment of the white
race. White nationalists view
multiculturalism, diversity, and illegal im-
migration as direct assaults on the white
race and race-mixing as akin to white geno-
cide. They hope to appeal to mainstream
whites, believing that the majority of white
people do not understand the imminent or
long-term threat to their race. Many con-
tend that a race war, often referred to as
RAHOWA, or Racial Holy War, is a cer-
tainty’’;
Whereas White supremacy and White na-
tionalism are contrary to the ideals of the
United States of America, which was estab-
lished according to the principle stated in
the Declaration of Independence that all
men are created equal, a principle that was
updated in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York,
to include all people;
Whereas while our country has often fallen
short of these ideals, patriotic Americans
have sought to form a more perfect Union by
rejecting White nationalism and White su-
premacy, embracing inclusive patriotism,
and welcoming immigrants from across the
globe who have continuously enriched our
Nation;
Whereas Abraham Lincoln in an 1858
speech said of the Founders, ‘‘Wise states-
men as they were, they knew the tendency of
prosperity to breed tyrants, and so they es-
tablished these great self-evident truths,
that when in the distant future some man,
some faction, some interest, should set up
the doctrine that none but rich men, or none
but white men, were entitled to life, liberty,
and pursuit of happiness, their posterity
might look up again to the Declaration of
Independence and take courage to renew the
battle which their fathers began—so that
truth, and justice, and mercy, and all the hu-
mane and Christian virtues might not be ex-
tinguished from the land; so that no man
would hereafter dare to limit and cir-
cumscribe the great principles on which the
temple of liberty was being built’’;
Whereas Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., while
recognizing that ‘‘no other nation can mean
to us what our nation means’’, condemned
‘‘nationalism perverted into chauvinism and
isolationism’’ as ‘‘preached by . . . the advo-
cators of white supremacy’’ and asked, ‘‘Will
we continue to serve the false god of racial
prejudice or will we serve the God who made
of one blood all men to dwell upon the face
of the earth?’’;
Whereas President Reagan observed in a
1988 speech, ‘‘Anyone, from any corner of the
Earth, can come to live in America and be-
come an American . . . This, I believe, is one
of the most important sources of America’s
greatness. We lead the world because, unique
among nations, we draw our people—our
strength—from every country and every cor-
ner of the world. And by doing so we continu-
ously renew and enrich our nation. While
other countries cling to the stale past, here
in America we breathe life into dreams. We
create the future, and the world follows us
into tomorrow. Thanks to each wave of new
arrivals to this land of opportunity, we’re a
nation forever young, forever bursting with
energy and new ideas, and always on the cut-
ting edge, always leading the world to the
next frontier. This quality is vital to our fu-
ture as a nation. If we ever closed the door to
new Americans, our leadership in the world
would soon be lost’’;
Whereas according to FBI statistics, hate
crimes nationwide increased in 2015, 2016, and
2017, the three most recent years for which
data is available;
Whereas the perpetrator of the shooting
that killed 9 African-American worshippers
at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal
Church in Charleston, South Carolina, on
June 17, 2015, was motivated by White su-
premacy and White nationalism to carry out
this act of terrorism, and stated that he
would ‘‘be rescued by white nationalists
after they took over the government’’;
Whereas the perpetrator of the shooting
that killed 11 Jewish worshippers at Tree of
Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
on October 27, 2018, accused Jews of ‘‘waging
a propaganda war against Western civiliza-
tion’’ and ‘‘committing genocide’’ against
Whites by promoting immigration and ref-
ugee resettlement, and accused the President
of being ‘‘a globalist, not a nationalist’’ be-
cause of the ‘‘infestation’’ of Jews; and
Whereas Public Law 115–58, a joint resolu-
tion signed into law on September 14, 2017,
rejects ‘‘white nationalism, white suprema-
cists, the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and other
hate groups’’: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives once again rejects White nationalism
and White supremacy as hateful expressions
of intolerance that are contradictory to the
values that define the people of the United
States.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
ADAMS). Pursuant to the rule, the gen-

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous materials on the measure under
consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
b 1400
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, this resolution
stands for one very simple proposition:
White nationalism and white suprem-
acy are hateful expressions of intoler-
ance that have no place in the United
States of America.
Unfortunately, what should be an ob-
vious statement in 2019 has been chal-
lenged in recent days, and not for the
first time, by one of our own col-
leagues. As those elected to represent
all of America, Members of Congress
should be the first to condemn white
nationalism and white supremacy,
which are the source of so much vio-
lence, so much hatred, and so much di-
visiveness throughout our Nation’s his-
tory. These hateful ideologies are dia-
metrically opposed to what America is
supposed to be.
But, as the New York Times reported
last week, Mr. KING of Iowa was quoted
as saying:
‘‘White nationalist, white suprema-
cist, Western civilization—how did that
language become offensive?’’
Well, I will tell him, and anyone else
who may be confused.
This language has always been offen-
sive. We fought a civil war to establish
that. But this language and the philos-
ophy it represents persisted. It moti-
vated the Ku Klux Klan to terrorize Af-
rican Americans; it sparked Jim Crow
laws that oppressed African Americans
through institutionalized racism; it in-
spired the murder of nine Black
congregants in a Charleston, South
Carolina, church; and the murder of 11
Jewish worshippers in a Pittsburgh
synagogue; and it inspired racists,
anti-Semites, and other assorted bigots
at the Unite the Right rally in Char-
lottesville, Virginia, that spread fear,
hatred, and, ultimately, violence in
celebration of white supremacy.
These hateful ideologies are dan-
gerous, not because they too often lead
to violence. These noxious views can
also infect the policies that govern our
Nation, sowing more division, and lead-
ing to more injustice in our society.
When we establish Muslim bans; when
we try to build walls to keep out those
who do not look like us; and when we
reverse a half century of progress on
voting rights and civil rights, we are
putting these hateful views into action.
I thank the distinguished majority
whip, the gentleman from South Caro-
lina (Mr. CLYBURN), for bringing this
resolution forward. He knows from his
experience—both as a leader in the
civil rights movement, and as a Mem-
ber of Congress whose own constituents
were recently targeted in a vicious at-
tack motivated by white supremacy—
that when we see bigotry and hatred
expressed in any form, we must con-
demn it, loudly and forcefully.
We can pretend that these senti-
ments do not exist in our country, in
this Congress, or in the White House.
We can try to sweep them under the
rug, and to convince ourselves that we
have moved past our shameful history
on race. But we ignore white suprem-
acy at our peril. If we do not speak out
now, collectively as a Congress, clearly
and without reservation, we will send
the message that these views are ac-
ceptable, and they will continue to fes-
ter in communities across the country,
generating more hatred, more repres-
sion, and more violence, in their wake.
Madam Speaker, I call upon all of my
colleagues—Republican and Democrat
alike—to reject the hateful ideology of
white nationalism and white suprem-
acy, the policies that flow from such
hatred, and anyone who would espouse
those views. Vote ‘‘yes’’ on this impor-
tant resolution.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Madam Speaker, this resolution re-
solves that ‘‘the House of Representa-
tives once again rejects white nation-
alism and white supremacy as hateful
expressions of intolerance that are con-
tradictory to the values that define the
people of the United States,’’ and with
that I agree.
As the ranking member of the Judici-
ary Committee, I would like to use my
time to consider with my colleagues
how firmly America has stood, and
continues to stand, against white su-
premacy. It is a basic human flaw that
our eyes open to truth too slowly and
close on wickedness too quickly.
Today, we have the opportunity to
renew our gaze at the truth about our
fellow men and women, and that each
of them is created with untold dignity
and worth.
As a result, we recognize that white
supremacy and white nationalism ped-
dle lies about our brothers and sisters
in dignity. We reject these lies, and we
stand on the shoulders of Americans
who have gone before us in rejecting
white supremacy and racism.
As Martin Luther King, Jr., observed,
‘‘When the architects of our Republic
wrote the magnificent words of the
Constitution and the Declaration of
Independence, they were signing a
promissory note to which every Amer-
ican was to fall heir. This note was a
promise that all men’’—yes, Black men
as well as White men—‘‘would be guar-
anteed the inalienable rights of life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.’’
Dr. King’s words are historical fact
rooted in universal truth.
America’s Founders gave us an in-
credible inheritance in the Declaration
of Independence, in which they said
‘‘all men are created equal.’’ This dec-
laration helped the Founders and all
Americans who have lived after them
identify the many ways that we dis-
honor that equality, recognize and rec-
tify it, and set a more just path for-
ward.
In 1807, President Thomas Jefferson—
himself a slave owner—publicly sup-
ported the abolition of the slave trade,
imploring Congress to ‘‘withdraw the
citizens of the United States from all
further participation in those viola-
tions of human rights which have been
so long continued on the unoffending
inhabitants of Africa.’’
George Washington said, ‘‘There is
not a man living who wishes more sin-
cerely than I do to see a plan adopted
for the abolition of slavery.’’
John Adams wrote that ‘‘Every meas-
ure of prudence, therefore, ought to be
assumed for the eventual total extir-
pation of slavery from the United
States . . . ‘’ and ‘‘I have, through my
whole life, held the practice of slavery
in . . . abhorrence.’’
Benjamin Franklin believed ‘‘Slavery
is . . . an atrocious debasement of
human nature.’’
Alexander Hamilton cited racial prej-
udice as something that ‘‘makes us
fancy many things that are founded
neither in reason nor experience.’’
And James Madison wrote that ‘‘We
have seen the mere distinction of color
made in the most enlightened period of
time, a ground of the most oppressive
dominion ever exercised by man over
man.’’
The words of our Founders indict
anyone who would believe that white
supremacy or actions born out of that
world view is in any way defensible.
It does all Americans good to revisit
our path out of darkness that feeds ra-
cial injustice so that we never find our-
selves slipping back, but rather move
forward knowing that we are all cre-
ated equal and all are created in God’s
image.
At the beginning of the American
Revolution, slavery existed in all the 13
original States, and the slave trade
with Africa was carried on uncon-
strained. Official actions to abolish
slavery began in 1774, before independ-
ence was even declared, and this moral
movement gained substantial ground
over the next 35 years.
Delegates to the First Continental
Congress in 1774 pledged to stop the im-
portation of slaves into America, and
by 1798 every State had outlawed slave
importation. During the founding era,
eight States proceeded to abolish slav-
ery, either gradually or immediately.
Were these good steps? Yes. Were they
enough? Certainly not.
Congress passed the Northwest Ordi-
nance in 1787, forbidding slavery in the
territory where the future States of
Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, and
Wisconsin would be established. This
law proved to be decisive in ending

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

slavery in America. In the 1850s, Abra-
ham Lincoln cited the Northwest Ordi-
nance frequently to show that the
Founders opposed the expansion of
slavery. And, in the 1860s, these States,
along with a number of their fellow
States, formed the coalition that elect-
ed Lincoln President, won the Civil
War, and abolished slavery nationwide.
The principle that all men are cre-
ated equal and have a fundamental
right to liberty gave the emancipation
movement its foundation.
As James Madison wrote in the Fed-
eralist Papers, defending the ratifica-
tion of the Constitution, the Constitu-
tion was grounded on ‘‘the funda-
mental principles of the revolution,’’
namely, ‘‘the transcendent laws of na-
ture and of nature’s God’’ and ‘‘the
rights of humanity announced in the
Declaration of Independence.’’
Our first Republican President, Lin-
coln, understood this well. When Lin-
coln was a young man, he said the
Founders established ‘‘political insti-
tutions, conducing more essentially to
the ends of civil and religious liberty,
than any of which the history of
former times tell us.’’
In the Gettysburg Address, President
Lincoln explained that America was
‘‘conceived in liberty, and dedicated to
the proposition that all men are cre-
ated equal.’’ As Lincoln argued to his
opponent, Stephen Douglas, this equal-
ity applies to all human beings, regard-
less of race.
When President Lincoln spoke of
America’s earlier days, he said, ‘‘I will
remind Judge Douglas and this audi-
ence, that while Mr. Jefferson was the
owner of slaves, as undoubtedly he was,
in speaking upon this very subject, he
used the strong language that he trem-
bled for his Nation when he remem-
bered that God was just.’’
Mr. Speaker, from my faith back-
ground, I will tell you, God is just, and
I do tremble when I consider his jus-
tice. I tremble when any person, in any
way, pretends that white supremacy
has any affinity with the Christian
faith or its heritage, and, frankly, am
very offended when that is brought up.
The Bible is clear on the equality of all
people. White people are entitled to no
special privilege on this Earth, and
they will have no unique standing in
heaven. In fact, my Bible tells me we
will all give account for what we do.
Heaven is a place where every person
there is united in bowing before the
God who made us equal.
Knowing this, we understand that we
should use this life to honor our broth-
ers and sisters without exception. As
James tells us, ‘‘If you really fulfill the
royal law according to the Scripture,
‘You shall love your neighbor as your-
self,’ you are doing well. But if you
show partiality, you are committing
sin.’’
Partiality is unacceptable in God’s
economy, and racial prejudice finds no
shelter among American values. Favor-
itism rooted in racism is evil in all its
forms, including white supremacy and
white nationalism.
Today, Madam Speaker, is a day like
many others. Today, like every day,
the world is watching America to see if
we still believe in equality, if we still
elevate human dignity at every turn,
and if we will reject hypocrisy when-
ever it tries to take root among us.
Today, our fellow citizens are watching
to see their leaders live out the Amer-
ican principles alongside them.
Today, I stand here with colleagues
to reaffirm these values and reject
white supremacy as both dangerous
and foolish. Its tenets are as ridiculous
as America’s democracy is remarkable.
Today, Madam Speaker, our message
is, as it ever was, that every person is
created equal in value, and that the
hill of equality is one Americans will
stand tall to defend, and, yes, even die
to defend.
We are all, Madam Speaker, created
in God’s wonderful image. He made us
and he breathed life into us. We are the
very essence of his beloved creation.
There is not a person you will find
today, Madam Speaker, no one—I chal-
lenge you from the depths of any pris-
on, to the sidewalks of any major city,
anywhere in this country, White,
Black, any color imaginable, any race
imaginable, any place that they come
from, male or female—there is not one
person you will find today that, when
you look into their eyes, they are not
deeply beloved by their God who cre-
ated them, and how can we choose any
different. Any ideology that comes in
face-to-face confrontation with God’s
creation is an abomination, and that is
exactly what this ideology is.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN), the dis-
tinguished majority whip.
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding me
the time.
Madam Speaker, I want to say to my
colleague, Mr. COLLINS, that I wish to
associate myself with the sentiments
that he expressed here today. However,
I also rise today to speak of how the
tale of two Kings has brought us to this
moment in history.
If he had been allowed to live, today
would have been the 90th birthday of
Martin Luther King, Jr. Today, this
august body stands ready to vote to
disapprove of Representative STEVE
KING’s recent comments and condemn
the evil concepts of white nationalism
and white supremacy.
White supremacy and white nation-
alism are evils, they are insidious, and
are clear and present dangers to our
great Republic. Reported hate crimes
rose 17 percent last year, which was the
third consecutive year that we have
seen an increase in this insidiousness.
This is appalling and unacceptable.
When elected representatives give
cover and comfort to those who spread
racial divisiveness, we embolden those
on the fringes of our society, and we
have seen some of the results: the mas-
sacre of nine parishioners in historic
Charleston’s Emanuel AME Church at
the hands of a young man who believed
he would be, in his words, ‘‘rescued by
white nationalists after they took over
the government;’’ the murder of 11
Jewish worshippers at the Tree of Life
synagogue in Pittsburgh by a gunman
who believed the Jews were, in his
words, ‘‘waging a propaganda war
against Western civilization.’’
The other term used by Mr. KING in
his comments to the New York Times;
and we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia,
at the white nationalists’ Unite the
Right rally, where they chanted the
Nazi phrase, ‘‘blood and soil.’’
b 1415
Some have questioned the timing of
this resolution. Why now? they ask.
My guidance, Madam Speaker, comes
from Dr. King, who wrote in his letter
from the Birmingham jail: ‘‘Time itself
is neutral; it can be used either de-
structively or constructively. More and
more I feel,’’ continued Dr. King, ‘‘that
the people of ill will have used time
much more effectively than have the
people of good will.’’
Then he closed his thought with
these words: ‘‘We must use time cre-
atively, in the knowledge that the time
is always ripe to do right.’’
Now is the time to do right. We have
reached a tipping point. Racial divi-
siveness is a fault line that is ripping
our Nation apart. This body must
speak out against this evil. The time
has come to condemn those of ill will
and say that no part in our great Na-
tion can be had by them.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield an additional 1 minute to the
gentleman from South Carolina.
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker,
when the French historian Alexis de
Tocqueville came to this country, he
observed its greatness and set out to
find the genius that made it so. He
wrote in his book ‘‘Democracy in
America’’ that: ‘‘The greatness of
America lies not in being more enlight-
ened than any other Nation, but rather
in her ability to repair her faults.’’
White supremacy and white nation-
alism are faults that cannot be re-
paired but must be removed.
White supremacy and white nation-
alism should be condemned by this
body, and I call upon my colleagues to
join me in doing so.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Iowa (Mr. KING).
Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Georgia for
yielding me time to address this issue.
I understand and recognize the grav-
ity of this issue that is before us. I can
hear it from the voice of the gentleman
from Georgia. I can hear it from Mr.
CLYBURN. And I can hear it from Mr.
NADLER.
I know all of you, and I think I know
all of you well. I thought you all knew

me well. But I began to read this reso-
lution, Madam Speaker, and I started
with the first ‘‘whereas,’’ and I am
going to read it as it is here: ‘‘Whereas,
on January 10, 2019, Representative
STEVE KING was quoted as asking,
‘White nationalist, white supremacist,
Western civilization’ ’’—there is a dash
in there, a pause—‘‘ ‘how did that lan-
guage become offensive?’ ’’
I understand how you interpreted my
words when you read them this way.
There is no tape for this interview that
I did. It was 56 minutes long. There are
some notes on the other end, but there
is no tape. There is no way to go back
and listen. But I can tell you this: That
ideology never shows up in my head. I
don’t know how it could possibly come
out of my mouth.
So I am going to tell you that the
words are likely what I said, but I want
to read it to you the way I believe I
said it. And that is this: ‘‘White na-
tionalist, white supremacist, Western
civilization—how did that language be-
come offensive? Why did I sit in classes
teaching me about the merits of our
history and civilization’’—that is the
end of the quote—just to watch ‘‘West-
ern civilization’’ become a derogatory
term in political discourse today? That
is what I believe happened.
And it is 13 words, ironically, that
has caused this firestorm. And, again, I
regret that we are in this place. I read
all of the rest of the resolutions that
are here.
Number two, I reject the ideology.
The statement is true, Mr. CLYBURN.
Number three, same story. I reject
the ideology that is noted in here. Your
statement is true.
As I read these so far down, number
four, number five, all the way through
all of these resolutions, all of the
‘‘whereases’’ that are here in this reso-
lution, I agree with all of them.
I agree with every word that you
have put in this. It is an honest and a
direct resolution put together to ad-
dress a subject that has been too long
before the public dialogue in this coun-
try.
And when I look down at the ‘‘re-
solved’’—that is usually the meat of
these—it says: ‘‘Resolved, That the
House of Representatives once again
rejects white nationalism and white su-
premacy as hateful expressions of in-
tolerance that are contradictory to the
values that define the people of the
United States.’’ Well, I agree with that.
Just a couple of weeks ago, I stood on
this floor with a Bible in my hand, and
I took an oath to support and defend
the Constitution of the United States.
That Bible wasn’t just a regular Bible
picked up somewhere. That was a shirt-
pocket-sized leather Bible that my
Great Uncle John Richardson carried
in his shirt pocket for 3 years in the
Civil War.
I come from a family of abolitionists.
Maybe I would have some artifacts
from his cousin, my five times great-
grandfather, if he hadn’t been killed in
that conflict.
This means something to me, the
abolitionism that goes clear back into
my family, and they paid a price with
their lives to make sure that all men,
and now all women, are created equal,
and we are endowed by our Creator
with certain unalienable rights. Those
rights are life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness.
I absolutely believe in that. It is in
my heart and my soul, and in my
works. By their fruits you shall know
them.
But The New York Times has a dif-
ferent version of this. They make a
habit of attacking the President, as a
matter of fact. And I look at this lan-
guage that is here, this resolution that
the House of Representatives once
again rejects white nationalism, white
supremacy, and hateful expressions of
intolerance that are contradictory to
the values that define the people of the
United States. I agree with that lan-
guage, as I have said. But I would add
to it the language that I used on this
floor, this very place, last Friday after-
noon, when I said I would strengthen it
by adding my previous statements,
which not only correctly reject white
nationalism and white supremacy as
evil ideologies, but also condemn any-
one that supports this evil and bigoted
ideology that saw in its ultimate ex-
pression the systematic murder of 6
million innocent Jewish lives.
That is where I stand. That is what I
believe.
So I want to compliment the gen-
tleman from South Carolina for bring-
ing this resolution. I have carefully
studied every word in this resolution,
and even though I would add some
more that are stronger language, I
agree with the language in it.
So I want to ask my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle, let’s vote for
this resolution. I am putting up a
‘‘yes’’ on the board here because what
you state here is right, and it is true,
and it is just, and so is what I have
stated here on the floor of the House of
Representatives.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, how
much time do I have remaining?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 111⁄2 min-
utes remaining.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I thank the gentleman. I beg to differ
with my good friend from Iowa. I do be-
lieve that we are all created equal with
certain inalienable rights. What I
would say to him is that Western civ-
ilization is what we all are. There is no
denigrating of Western civilization. It
is what America is.
We are the greatest leader of Western
civilization. We are the greatest leader
of the free world. But what we are
speaking about is, of course, the words
‘‘white nationalism’’ and ‘‘white su-
premacy,’’ for it is clear that the FBI
makes a direct point between dehu-
manizing and derogatory comments,
which come from white nationalists
and white supremacists, to the idea
that it generates, as you have heard
here on the floor of the House. It gen-
erates the death of Dr. Martin Luther
King. It generates Charlottesville. It
generates Charleston, South Carolina.
It generates hateful acts that result in
death.
This is the kind of tolerating of this
that we cannot suffer and the intoler-
ance that we cannot suffer. Because
the idea of white nationalism, as supe-
rior to others, and white supremacy in-
dicates that somebody else might die.
This resolution is an important reso-
lution to affirm to this Congress and
this Nation that we believe that we all
are created equal and, as Dr. King said,
that, ‘‘We shall overcome.’’ And, some
day, we shall overcome.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs.
MILLER).
Mrs. MILLER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to speak out against white su-
premacy. As a Christian, I live my life
by the guidance and teachings of Jesus
Christ and by the many great lessons
in the Bible.
Matthew 7:12 tells us: ‘‘So whatever
you wish that others would do to you,
do also to them.’’
This is the golden rule, that we treat
every person as we wish to be treated.
This is why I stand here today to say
that there is no place for white su-
premacy, anti-Semitism, racism, or
bigotry of any kind in Congress.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Tennessee (Mr. COHEN), a distinguished
member of the Judiciary Committee.
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I thank
Mr. NADLER for yielding me the time.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mr.
CLYBURN for bringing this resolution,
and I want to thank the Republican
leadership, Mr. MCCARTHY and com-
pany, who have condemned white su-
premacist and white nationalist lan-
guage.
It is important that we come to-
gether and condemn this language be-
cause, unfortunately, in Charlottes-
ville, Virginia, we had Ku Klux Klan
people and neo-Nazis marching and
saying: ‘‘Jews will not replace us in
blood and soil.’’ Our President said
there were fine people on both sides.
We must condemn bigotry, racial su-
periority, and hate whenever it raises
its ugly head so that it will not come
back to bite us once again.
So today, hopefully, in the House, we
have done that. I commend my Repub-
lican colleagues and Mr. COLLINS, and I
hope that when hatred and bigotry
once against surface, raises its head,
which it will, that we will stand to-
gether as Americans to condemn it and
not see fine people on both sides.

H576 January 15, 2019
in support of this resolution, which,
again, rejects white nationalism and
white supremacy as hateful expressions
of intolerance that are contradictory
to our values that define the people of
the United States.
I call on my colleagues, both Repub-
licans and Democrats, to denounce ra-
cial and religious bigotry of all stripes.
Like many, I do have some personal
insight into this problem. It doesn’t
come as a surprise to many that, being
from Utah, I am a Mormon. And my
church, as many know, was founded in
New York in the early 1800s. We were
driven further and further west as
members of my church were targeted,
harassed, and killed for their sincerely
held religious beliefs, culminating in
the murder of our founder and subse-
quent decision to relocate to Utah.
My own ancestors were targeted in
this bigotry. They lost their posses-
sions. They lost their lands. They lost
their freedom. And in some cases, they
lost their lives. Unfortunately, such
hatred still exists today.
Three years ago, we witnessed the
tragedy in Charleston, where a de-
ranged individual motivated by white
supremacy shot and killed nine Black
worshipers and injured many others.
We remember the riots in Charlottes-
ville, where a white nationalist struck
and killed a White woman who was pro-
testing, once again, white supremacy.
b 1430
But the problem is more widespread
than just these individuals who advo-
cate for white supremacy. We also need
to condemn anti-Semitism, anti-Zion-
ism, and those who enable it.
Last October, a perpetrator shot and
killed 11 Jewish worshippers at the
Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh,
which we all remember.
All of these should be condemned by
all of us here in this body: Black,
White, rich, poor, Muslim, Christian, or
Jewish. We are all, I believe, children
of the same God.
I hope that the majority is sincere in
ushering in this resolution to the floor
not as just an opportunity to shame
one party as irredeemably racist, but
as a united statement against bigotry.
When bigotry goes unchallenged, it
festers and rears its ugly head in ways
that test our Nation’s greatest tri-
umphs in shedding these shameful
practices of slavery and other types of
racial and religious intolerance. This is
something that must unite this body. I
hope that it does, and I believe that it
will.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.
CICILLINE).
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in support of Mr. CLYBURN’s
resolution condemning white suprem-
acy and white nationalism.
Congressman STEVE KING’s recent
comments asserting that terms like
‘‘white supremacist’’ should be accept-
able have rightly drawn strong con-
demnation from both sides of the aisle
in this Chamber. Sadly, these com-
ments are part of a well-documented
history of embracing the far right and
making racist and anti-immigrant re-
marks for more than a decade.
As all of us know, more and more
people are feeling emboldened today to
publicly voice bigoted and evil views
like these. We have seen it in discus-
sions around Charlottesville, the cur-
rent debate on immigration, and in
criticism of football players silently
and peacefully protesting police bru-
tality.
These views are contrary to our
country’s founding values of fairness
and equality. America was founded on
the simple but powerful idea that all
are created equal and are worthy of
dignity and respect.
White nationalism and white suprem-
acy are a vile assault on that magnifi-
cent ideal. These views belong on the
ash heap of history. That is exactly
where this resolution will put them.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
RESCHENTHALER), who is a freshman.
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.
Res. 41, a resolution rejecting white na-
tionalism and white supremacy.
As a lifelong resident of south-
western Pennsylvania, I was dev-
astated by the shooting that killed 11
Jewish worshippers and wounded six
others at the Tree of Life synagogue in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on October
27, 2018. This despicable act of domestic
terrorism reminded us that evil is alive
in this world and must be confronted in
a spirit of courage.
The day after this cowardly act of vi-
olence, I stood in solidarity with Amer-
icans of all religions, all races, and all
ethnicities at a vigil honoring the vic-
tims of this heinous crime. There is no
place for this kind of thinking in our
country.
When the rights of any community
are under attack, all of our rights are
under attack. We must come together
as a nation to stand up against hatred,
white nationalism, and bigotry in our
country.
I commend the leadership of my
party for their strong response to any
comments that divide our country, and
I thank my colleague from South Caro-
lina for introducing this important res-
olution.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs.
DEMINGS).
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, it
is surely a shame that it is necessary
in the year 2019 for the U.S. Congress
to denounce white nationalism in Con-
gress.
As a police officer, I worked white su-
premacist rallies. The words alone hurt
enough, but as a police officer, I also
saw vicious acts of violence by those
inspired by those hateful words.
Words do have consequences, and if
you promote hateful, ignorant beliefs,
then you will be held accountable. Cer-
tainly, Congress should lead the way.
This week, the ignorance of white na-
tionalism was defended by one of my
colleagues. Today, as we recognize Dr.
King’s birthday, I am reminded that
Dr. King called on all Americans to en-
list in a crusade finally to end the race
question and make it an ugly relic of a
dark past. But still we know hate
crimes are on the rise. We understand
why.
Madam Speaker, if we are who we say
we are, a great nation, one nation with
liberty and justice for all, then we all
must exercise our power and take a
stand so strong that even the white su-
premacists cannot ignore it.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.
JAYAPAL).
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, it
has been an open secret for too long
that Representative STEVE KING of
Iowa has made his trade in saying and
pushing fundamentally racist and un-
acceptable ideas. While I am glad that
my colleagues on the other side are
speaking out and have taken this im-
portant act of stripping Mr. KING of his
committees, let us be very clear that
those of us who have served with Mr.
KING on the Judiciary Committee,
those of us who are African American,
Latino, immigrant, those of us who are
Caucasian and steeped in our country’s
history of slavery and racism, we all
know that the record of these kinds of
comments is long.
In 2013, Mr. KING said that, for every
Dreamer who is a valedictorian, there
are another 100 undocumented immi-
grants who have calves the size of can-
taloupes because they are hauling 75
pounds of drugs across the border.
In 2017, he said that we couldn’t re-
store civilization with ‘‘somebody
else’s babies.’’ Madam Speaker, how
dare he. I was born in India. I am some-
body else’s baby, and I am a proud
American.
Just last year, Mr. KING met with a
Nazi-linked party in Austria. He is a
Member of Congress who continuously
makes these comments that cause the
deepest of harm to real people, phys-
ical harm in the form of hate crimes,
and psychological harm.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield the gentlewoman from Wash-
ington an additional 30 seconds.
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, all
of us, whether African American, peo-
ple of color, immigrants, we are not
other categories of people. We are not
somebody else. We are America, all of
us.
The terrible truth is that racism and
xenophobia escalates when racism and
white supremacy are permitted here in

Congress and all the way up to the
White House to be issues with both
sides. There are no both sides when it
comes to white supremacy.
So, Madam Speaker, I hope that this
is just the start of a definitive
partywide turn away from racism for
all of us on both sides.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, how
much time do I have remaining?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 6 minutes
remaining.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to distinguished gen-
tleman from California (Mr.
SWALWELL).
Mr. SWALWELL of California.
Madam Speaker, I rise to reject white
nationalism, to reject white suprem-
acy, and to reject anyone who supports
these immoral ideas.
I reject STEVE KING. So does Amer-
ica.
Do you know what? So do the people
of Iowa’s Fourth Congressional Dis-
trict.
How do I know that? Because I was
born there to a police officer as a fa-
ther and a mom who raised four boys.
The way that they raised us is the way
that every family in cities like Ames,
Algona, and Sac City raised their kids:
to love each other, to love God, to
work together, and to believe that, in a
community, we come together and that
love always conquers. They reject the
bigotry that they hear day after day
from their Representative.
I want to make sure that every per-
son in the United States knows that
what was expressed by our colleague is
an exception and does not define the
hardworking people of western Iowa.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, may I inquire of the time re-
maining in the debate.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 3 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from New
York has 5 minutes remaining.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to distinguished gentle-
woman from California (Ms. LEE).
Ms. LEE of California. Madam
Speaker, I thank Chairman NADLER for
yielding, and I also want to thank Ma-
jority Whip CLYBURN for his leadership
in putting this resolution together.
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this resolution, which sends a
clear message that we will not accept
hate or bigotry within this House.
Let me be clear: While Congressman
KING’s comments condoning white su-
premacy were abhorrent, they were not
a surprise to many of us. In years past,
Congressman KING has implied that
Dreamers are drug dealers; he has en-
dorsed far right, authoritarian, and
neo-Nazis sympathizers; and he has re-
peatedly reiterated the belief that
multicultural communities are a
threat to our society. These racist be-
liefs should not be espoused by anyone,
let alone a United States Congressman.
I grew up in the Jim Crow South,
Madam Speaker. I know that racism
and discrimination don’t just cause
pain. When these beliefs become poli-
cies, which Congressman KING votes on
and writes, they institutionalize a vi-
cious system that people of color have
to deal with as it relates to being de-
nied equal rights and equal respect.
These are the consequences of white
supremacy.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield the gentlewoman an additional 30
seconds.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam
Speaker, I ask my colleagues in both
parties to vote today, on what would
have been Dr. King’s 90th birthday, to
condemn white nationalism and white
supremacy.
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote
on this resolution.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentlewoman from California (Ms.
JUDY CHU).
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam
Speaker, as chair of the Congressional
Asian Pacific American Caucus, I rise
to reject white nationalism and white
supremacy. These philosophies divide
us, teach fear, and lead to violence.
They are to blame for the worst of
American history, from slavery and
Jim Crow to the fatal shooting of
Sikhs at an Oak Creek gurdwara and
Jews at the Tree of Life synagogue.
White nationalism led to the passage
of the Chinese Exclusion Act, forcing
Chinese immigrants like my grand-
father to be condemned to life as a sec-
ond-class citizen. But today, his grand-
daughter stands here as the first Chi-
nese American woman in Congress.
I am not alone. This is the most di-
verse and representative Congress in
our history.
The message is clear: diversity has a
place in Congress, prejudice does not.
But white nationalism is finding a
home in politics once again through
racist rhetoric and xenophobic misin-
formation aimed at immigrants and
others. Any attempt by politicians at
any level to encourage fear of those
who look different must be rejected.
Madam Speaker, I urge support for
this resolution.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.
CUNNINGHAM.)
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker,
I rise to support H. Res. 41 rejecting
white nationalism and white suprem-
acy.
Today, on what would have been Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr.’s 90th birth-
day, I am honored to join Majority
Whip CLYBURN in denouncing the racist
remarks of Representative STEVE KING
and condemning white supremacy and
white nationalism in all forms. Hatred
and bigotry should have no home in
America, and certainly not one in the
Halls of Congress.
Dr. King was one of the finest citi-
zens this country has produced: a
champion for justice and a fearless cru-
sader for equality. Today and every
day, we must honor the life and legacy
of Dr. King, while also acknowledging
the work which remains. We must
strongly condemn hateful expressions
of intolerance wherever and whenever
we see them.
America is strongest when we stand
together. From the Lowcountry to the
heartland, I believe that today is a
promising start.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN).
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in
support of this resolution, but I also
believe that the House of Representa-
tives should go one step further, and I
believe we should institute a censure
for Mr. KING to signal to this country
and to our children that this behavior
is unacceptable.
The underlying premise is that we
have had leaders at the highest levels
down the street from here condone and
continue to perpetuate race-baiting
and white supremacist language that is
not good for this country. We need to
come together. We are a weaker coun-
try today because we are so divided.
What this is all about is whether the
United States is going to move forward
saying that we are a united country,
that we respect diversity—and not only
respect it, but recognize that our diver-
sity in this country is our greatest
strength. It is our greatest cultural
strength, and it is our greatest eco-
nomic strength. This House needs to
take this resolution one step further.

permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. ALLRED. Madam Speaker, I rise

acy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H578 January 15, 2019
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of
my time.
Madam Speaker, we have heard from
many here today, and I think we have
all come to a common theme, and the
common theme goes back to the simple
rule that most of us would have
learned growing up—and we have heard
it referenced here today, but it may be
as simple as in kindergarten—you hold
hands; you look after each other; you
treat people with respect no matter
where they come from, what they look
like, what the color of their skin is,
what their gender may be, or what reli-
gion they may practice.
What is true on the floor today and
what should be true in the hearts of
every American—and, frankly, not just
every American, but those around the
world—is that we realize that we have
been given a gift by God, that we have
been given the strength by God, and we
have been given the hope by God to
treat each other with dignity, respect,
and love. When we understand that,
then it takes away.
But we also, Madam Speaker, today
have realized that, when we as Mem-
bers speak, people pay attention and
people hold us accountable. We have
talked about that in many ways, and
that cannot continue in the way that
we have seen it.
White supremacy is wrong. White na-
tionalism is wrong. Anti-Semitism is
wrong.
When we divide ourselves and we
classify ourselves against each other,
we bring ourselves down, not those
whom we go after.
As long as we ever have anyone in
this country who believes that they
can climb to the top on the backs of
others because they make fun of their
race, their gender, their ethnicity, or
any other thing, then we devalue the
very breath that God gives us.
Madam Speaker, as I said earlier
when I opened this up, there is not any-
one we face today, anyone we come in
contact with today who is not inher-
ently and deeply loved by God. And it
is pretty simple; He breathed life into
them. I believe it with all that I am
here.
And if I can believe that God created
each and every person I see and every-
thing we see around us, how can I not
value that creation? How can I not
stand against anyone who would tear
that down, especially if there was ever
a thought in this country from any-
body, anywhere, to take and say this is
a Christian value? Then I challenge
them and say there will be a judgment.
It is already written down that no man
stands that way.
So today it is pretty simple. Place a
‘‘yes’’ vote on the floor. We support
this resolution because it is not an
American value; it is not what we
stand for.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield such time as he may consume to
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.
KRISHNAMOORTHI) to close the debate
on our side.
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam
Speaker, I rise on Martin Luther King,
Jr.’s birthday to urge passage of H.
Res. 41 and to reject white nationalism
and supremacy in all its forms.
I applaud both sides for taking up
this resolution in support of rejecting
white nationalism.
But today, Madam Speaker, I ask one
question: Where does President Trump
stand on this resolution? Will Presi-
dent Trump do as we are doing and re-
ject white supremacy in all its forms?
So far, we have heard nothing but si-
lence. I ask him to act and do the
same: reject white supremacy and
white nationalism, today.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, while I strongly
condemn white supremacy and white nation-
alism, my position remains unchanged. Any-
thing short of censure is shallow. STEVE KING
has made a career of making racist state-
ments. That is the only thing he is known for
and this pattern of rabid racism must be con-
fronted head on by the House of Representa-
tives. This resolution just restates the obvious.
It does not address STEVE KING’s violent, vitri-
olic, and rabid racism. This Democratic resolu-
tion is an insult to the legacy of Martin Luther
King, Jr. as we recognize his birthday. We
must proceed with a vote to censure him with
the same zeal that the House used when cen-
suring Charlie Rangel. Yesterday, the notice I
provided of my privileged resolution to formally
censure the Member from Iowa, started the
clock for a floor vote to punish him for his big-
otry and racism. We need to be clear to the
American people that we use condemnation to
express our disapproval of those not in the
House. We use censure for those in the
House, STEVE KING is a sitting member.
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to support the gentleman from
South Carolina’s resolution condemning the
recent remarks of our colleague STEVEN KING.
As we celebrate the 90th birthday of Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr., he indicated that ‘‘there
comes a time when one must take a position
that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but
he must take it because conscience tells him
that it is right.’’
Unfortunately, the recent rhetoric of Mr.
KING not only highlights the wrongs of our na-
tion’s dark past, but it promotes a spirit of divi-
sion, bitterness and fear.
At a time when our nation is looking to its
leaders to bring confidence and security, we
must take the steps toward unity and seek out
understanding and denounce thoughts that are
divisive.
There is no room for such rhetoric in the
most diverse Congress ever and I stand with
my colleagues to censure Congressman STE-
VEN KING.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from New York (Mr.
NADLER) that the House suspend the
rules and agree to the resolution, H.
Res. 41.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being

JODI READINGER, A TAX
PREPARER
(Ms. HOULAHAN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Speaker, I
rise for Jodi Readinger, a tax preparer
in Pennsylvania’s Sixth District. She
and her organization, the Berks Com-
munity Action Program, provide a
range of services to over 2,500 low-in-
come individuals and families in my
community. For example, her team
works for free to help people navigate
the complicated process of filing their
taxes.
During a weekend town hall in Berks
County this weekend, Jodi shared with
me that she has been unable to reach
the IRS to access tax preparation soft-
ware due to the shutdown. Her work is
responsible for bringing $1 million
worth of tax refunds back to my com-
munity and for saving $80,000 for her
customers.
I am a third generation veteran. Bor-
der protection is imperative and a real
issue. I am certain that there are meas-
ures to protect our borders that we can
come to an agreement on in this brand-
new Congress, but a shutdown is not
the answer.
Madam Speaker, I rise for the people
like Jodi, because shutting down the
government is failed policy.
f
HONORING PCN FOR 25 YEARS OF
FARM SHOW COVERAGE
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor
PCN for 25 years of outstanding cov-
erage of the Pennsylvania Farm Show.
Pennsylvania Cable Network, now
called PCN, was organized August 29,
1979, as a nonprofit corporation by
Pennsylvania cable companies.
PCN marked the first use of cable
television for distance education, and
it was the first educational cable tele-
vision network in the Nation. PCN was
on the air before CNN, ESPN, FOX
News, MSNBC, and nearly all other na-
tionally distributed cable networks.
In November 1993, PCN began pro-
viding public affairs programming in
prime time to provide viewers coverage
of the Pennsylvania General Assembly.
In 1994, it expanded beyond govern-
ment and covered every aspect of the
annual Pennsylvania Farm Show.
This year, PCN exclusively delivered
the Pennsylvania high school cham-
pionships rodeo, the sale of champions,
the celebrity rabbit hopping contest,
the grand champion junior market
goat and lamb show, the draft horse
competitions, the mini-horse pull,
square dancing competitions, and much
more.
Madam Speaker, I commend PCN on
25 years of exclusively delivering the
Farm Show to viewers in the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania, and I con-
gratulate PCN on this outstanding
achievement.

IMPACT OF THE GOVERNMENT
SHUTDOWN
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to bring my people’s voice into
this Chamber. They are going through
day 25 of an unnecessary government
shutdown. They are begging their land-
lords not to evict them because HUD
funding is suspended.
Our neighbors at home who live
among the biggest corporate polluters
are wondering, without EPA inspectors
on duty, if they are breathing in more
toxins than permitted under the law.
Madam Speaker, when did it become
okay to use people as pawns, to jeop-
ardize the well-being and way of life of
our residents back home?
I urge the leadership in the Senate to
put people first. Majority Leader
MCCONNELL works for the American
people, not the President. We don’t
need the President’s support.
So, please, Senators, pass the bills
you supported before, and let’s get our
government up and running again for
our families.
f
CONGRATULATING MEMBERS OF
ARIZONA LEGISLATURE
(Mr. BIGGS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, today, I
rise to congratulate all the Members of
the Arizona Legislature who took their
oaths of office to begin a new term this
week.
The start of each legislative session
is exciting: an opportunity to keep
promises made to constituents and
make Arizona a better place to work
and raise a family.
As ever, legislators will face chal-
lenges that will impact millions of Ari-
zonans. I look forward to working with
my former colleagues, especially those
in the east valley, for the benefit of our
constituents.
I recognize and give special congratu-
lations to incoming Senate President
Karen Fann and House Speaker Rusty
Bowers. I wish everyone in the Arizona
Legislature, including staff, a produc-
tive legislative session in the months
to come.
f
OPEN THE GOVERNMENT
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I can’t even account for this historic
and devastating Trump shutdown.
When I say I can’t account, I can’t
believe that the government is now in
the mix of a shutdown that has such
far-reaching proportions of impact,
negative impact: not only my constitu-
ents who work for so many Federal
agencies, from TSOs to Border Patrol,
to Customs and Border Protection, to
air traffic controllers, but those around
the Nation—the two Federal employee
family that is now going into their
son’s scholarship fund, the young
mother who now needs food assistance,
those who are on the SNAP program,
those who live in public housing, those
who are disabled.
Is there any empathy or sympathy in
the White House to begin intelligent
and informed negotiations, allowing us
to negotiate border security after the
fact but open the government now so
that people can be paid?
Madam Speaker, people are asking
me whether their healthcare coverage
is going to lapse because they are not
being paid. People are asking about
whether or not the credit scores that
are impacted by not being able to pay
your bills, how they are going to make
amends for that; about the mortgages
or the rent to landlords who are being
insensitive.
Madam Speaker, the bottom line:
Open the government, Mr. Trump, for
the American people.
f
BORDER WALL FUNDING
(Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-

Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in support of President
Trump’s request for border wall fund-
ing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H582 January 15, 2019
Yes, we are a nation of immigrants. I
know firsthand. My grandparents emi-
grated from Sweden to the Upper Pe-
ninsula to start a new life in the 1890s,
but Congress has a constitutional duty
to provide for the safety and security
of our citizens. Right now, our immi-
gration system is broken, making ille-
gal entry into the U.S. a common oc-
currence rather than a random act.
President Trump is right to call this
a crisis. It is a crisis of our own mak-
ing, and it is time for Congress to do
our job.
We are on day 25 of the longest and
most avoidable government shutdown
in U.S. history. Those most vital to
protecting our borders, coasts, and
ports have now missed at least one
paycheck, with little to no progress
being made in Washington.
It is time to end this shutdown, se-
cure our borders, and get our govern-
ment open and working for the people.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues
to join me in supporting efforts to
build a wall.
f
A SHUTDOWN IS NOT THE ANSWER
(Ms. BROWNLEY of California asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute.)
Ms. BROWNLEY of California.
Madam Speaker, President Trump is
forcing more than 37,000 Californians,
including many veterans, to go without
pay. From Coast Guard members at
Naval Base Ventura County and Chan-
nel Islands Harbor to local air traffic
controllers, Ventura County residents
and their families are trying to make
ends meet without their paychecks.
On the first day of this Congress, I
joined my Democratic colleagues to
pass legislation to reopen the govern-
ment and provide for sensible border
security.
The President should not use people’s
lives and our economy as hostages to
build a campaign slogan. The President
closed the government. A shutdown is
not the answer.
Mr. President, reopen our govern-
ment now.
f
OKLAHOMA INAUGURATION DAY
(Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma.
Madam Speaker, I rise in celebration of
the inauguration of Oklahoma’s Gov-
ernor Kevin Stitt, Lieutenant Gov-
ernor Matt Pinnell, Insurance Commis-
sioner Glen Mulready, and State Super-
intendent Joy Hofmeister. These lead-
ers come from Oklahoma’s First Con-
gressional District and will represent
Tulsa well in our capital.
Governor Stitt, like our President
and myself, is an entrepreneur and a
businessman. He has a vision for Okla-
homa to be a top ten State, shaking up
the status quo in Oklahoma City and
turning the State around.
Lieutenant Governor Pinnell is, like-
wise, a business owner and has been an
advocate of the Republican Party and
conservative agenda in our State for
many years.
Commissioner Mulready is a long-
term insurance professional and busi-
nessman, most recently serving in the
Oklahoma House of Representatives as
the majority floor leader.
State Superintendent Joy
Hofmeister, another business owner, is
beginning her second term in the role
and will continue to work hard for
Oklahoma’s students.
A new day is dawning in Oklahoma
with the leadership of Governor Stitt,
Lieutenant Governor Pinnell, Commis-
sioner Mulready, and Superintendent
Hofmeister. I congratulate them on
this accomplishment and wish celebra-
tion and joy this week.
f
KEYSTONE TAILORED
MANUFACTURING PLAN CLOSURE
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to highlight yet another grim
economic headline, another broken
promise on jobs and trade from Presi-
dent Trump to the people of northern
Ohio, and more pink slips by another
factory shuttered.
Keystone Tailored Manufacturing
will close by March. Approximately 150
employees will lose their jobs.
Keystone has made men’s suits at the
site since 2015. Before that, it was a
Hugo Boss men’s suit plant. Since 2010,
workers fought to keep the facility
from closing twice. There won’t be a
third time.
As Mark Milko, the area director for
the Workers United union put it: ‘‘It
doesn’t look like there is anything to
fight to save.’’
Madam Speaker, this company plans
to shift these jobs to Canada. There
they can save $15 a suit on imported
buttons, zippers, shoulder supports, and
tariffs—because Canada isn’t involved
in a trade war with China that the
President has started. Under NAFTA,
they can then turn those suits right
back around to sell here in America for
nothing.
This President’s trade strategy is a
disaster. American workers suffer the
ultimate sacrifice. Our Nation must
put someone in charge who knows what
they are doing.
f
CONGRATULATING THE NORTH DA-
KOTA STATE UNIVERSITY FOOT-
BALL TEAM
(Mr. ARMSTRONG asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker,
the North Dakota State University
football team brought home their
record seventh FCS championship tro-
phy in 8 years.
On January 5, the Bison defeated the
Eastern Washington Eagles, 38–24. The
Eagles are a good team and attempted
several comebacks, but the Bison held
strong for the win.
Quarterback Easton Stick led the
Bison with a spectacular performance.
He had five touchdowns—two passing
and three rushing—for a combined 319
yards.
The Bison players were cheered on by
17,000 dedicated NDSU fans who trav-
eled over 1,000 miles south to Frisco,
Texas, for what has become an annual
journey.
Victory also sealed Coach Klieman’s
place in college football history. In his
five seasons, he has coached the team
to four national championships and
just four conference losses.
Madam Speaker, this incredible
achievement is the result of months of
hard work and preparation. Congratu-
lations to all Bison players, coaches,
and fans. They earned it.
f
AN IMPORTANT VICTORY FOR
DEMOCRACY
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute.)
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Madam Speaker, today, we had
an important victory for democracy. A
Federal judge in New York ordered the
Trump administration to remove a
planned citizenship question from the
2020 Census in response to a lawsuit
filed by the State of New York, which
was joined by 17 other States in sup-
port. I am proud to have led an amicus
brief of 126 Members of Congress, also
in support of this lawsuit.
The court affirmed what we already
knew: adding a citizenship question
was driven by partisan politics, in vio-
lation of the law. The Constitution re-
quires that the Census count every per-
son living in our country, and the ad-
ministration’s attempt to add a citi-
zenship question was a deliberate effort
to scare away noncitizens and their
families in order to undercount this
community.
Fortunately, the court agreed, but
there will likely be an appeal. That is
why I will be introducing legislation to
remove the citizenship question. We
must act quickly.
Our democracy depends on a full and
accurate count of our Nation, and we
cannot allow the Trump administra-
tion to compromise that.

including my former colleagues from
the Texas Senate. This administration
is seeking any funds or any means to
go around Congress to build his wall.
Congress is a coequal branch of gov-
ernment, Madam Speaker, with a duty
to appropriate funds for Hurricane Har-
vey. Any action to delay or divert
those funds puts lives at risk and po-
tentially displaces people from their
homes, many in my own district in
Houston.
We must do more to mitigate the
damages caused by flooding. Diverting
disaster funds to pay for a wall will not
accomplish that goal.
I am proud of the bipartisan opposi-
tion to this effort, and I hope that we
can work together in that same spirit
to end this Trump shutdown.

OPEN OUR GOVERNMENT
(Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker,
day 25. There is no reason for President
Trump to keep the government shut
down over his demands for an ineffec-
tive border wall.
On day one, the Democrats passed
legislation to reopen our government.
Today, we are taking further action,
bringing forward a continuing resolu-
tion to fund the government through
February 1, giving the President and
the Senate GOP yet another oppor-
tunity to end the shutdown, while al-
lowing time for us to do our work and
negotiate.
President Trump should stop holding
the health, the safety, and the pay-
checks of the American people hostage.
We need border security, and Demo-
crats stand strong on that issue, but we
will not waste taxpayers’ dollars. We
will not waste billions of taxpayer dol-
lars on an ineffective wall.
Mr. President, Congress, open our
government.

END THE SHUTDOWN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GARAMENDI) is recognized
for 60 minutes as the designee of the
majority leader.
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I
think I just heard that we are in the
25th day of the shutdown. I see some of
my good Republican friends over there,
and perhaps we ought to engage in a
debate about the wisdom of this shut-
down.
Can anybody find any good reason for
the shutdown?
Mr. MEADOWS. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. GARAMENDI. At the moment,
Mr. MEADOWS, perhaps I would yield
and you can give me a 30-second expla-
nation of why the shutdown makes
sense, but let’s talk about the shut-
down.
Let’s talk about the reality that the
President proposed in his budget for
2019 that we should spend somewhere
around $1.6 billion for border security,
not specifying walls or all of it, but
just border security.
We, of course, do what we always do.
We took that, and we put it through
the ringer. We came out with $1.6 bil-
lion for border security, including some
wall in there.
But we didn’t finish the task, so we
did a continuing resolution last Sep-
tember and kicked the ball down the
road, which is what we really do best,
boom, boom, boom, bounce down the
road until right after Thanksgiving.
Then we hadn’t quite completed it, so
in a day when none of us were here, by
unanimous consent, again, we kicked
the ball down the road until December
11.
Then the Senate sent over a piece of
legislation that was unanimously
passed in the Senate by voice vote, and
it wound up over here the next day.
Sometime between that evening when
it passed the Senate and it wound up
over here, the President decided that
he needed $5 billion for a border wall.
Now, perhaps there was a discussion
of appropriations sometime during that
process. I don’t know. But in any case,
it was in none of the bills. Suddenly,
we had a $5 billion addition to border
security. All of that happened over-
night.
At the same time, the President calls
into his Oval Office the leadership, and
he says that he will shut down the gov-
ernment, and he will take the mantle
of the shutdown.
So, my good friends from the Repub-
lican side of this aisle, here we are on
day 25.
A lot of things are going on out
there. There is not much going on
around here, unfortunately. But what
is going on out there?
I got a phone call from a mayor of
one of the small cities that I represent
down in the agricultural part north of
Sacramento. He said: Can you help us?
One of the veterans in my district, a
World War II veteran, is in hospice,
and, over the years, he lost his Purple
Heart for injuries that he suffered in
World War II. We would like to get that
back for him before he dies, but we
can’t. We can’t help him.
We can’t get that Purple Heart back
before this veteran dies because the
National Archives is shut down. Nor-
mally, we could. We would make our
request, and we would go to the Na-
tional Archives. Somehow we would
find the record, and we would get a re-
placement Purple Heart. We can’t do
that now. The National Archives is
shut down.
Another one of my constituents
wants to start a new business in one of
the towns that I represent west of Sac-
ramento. It is a little restaurant coffee
shop. He needs an SBA loan. He worked
it all through the bank. The bank is
ready to make the loan. The papers
can’t be signed. SBA is shut down.
How long can he hang on? How long
will that escrow remain open before
this deal tanks? Well, it is 25 days thus
far. Apparently, the deal is still in
place. But businesses all across this
Nation are not moving forward.
Recent estimates show that two-
tenths of a percent of the economic
growth of this Nation in this 25-day
shutdown has been removed from this
economy. We are looking somewhere
just north of 21⁄2, 3 percent, in that
range, but two-tenths of that is now
gone as a result of this shutdown.
Let us remind ourselves: This is en-
tirely the making of the President who
parachuted—no, bombed into our nego-
tiation process here, $5 billion in the 12
hours between the passage of a com-
promised, unanimous vote by the Sen-
ate to keep government going and the
arrival and the vote on that bill here
on this floor.
Madam Speaker, I will also state
that our Republican colleagues accom-
modated the President and put the $5
billion into the legislation and sent it
back to the Senate, and there it sat,
sine die. That legislation is gone.
However, we want to open govern-
ment. We think it is really important
that those veterans across this Nation
who want to get their records are able
to do so, and those men and women
who want to start a small business are
able to get their Small Business Ad-
ministration loans approved.
How about Foreign Service officers?
Oh, yes, the State Department isn’t
funded. Foreign Service officers are not
able to get the training that they need.
They go through a whole course before
they are sent off to some part of the
world—language, culture courses. None
of that is happening, to say nothing of
the fact that about a third of the ap-
pointments in the State Department
have never been filled to begin with.
Department of the Interior? Some of
us stuck around here over the weekend.
Normally, we would go down to the
Smithsonian and take a look, or the
National Museum of African American
History and Culture, or maybe the Na-
tional Museum of American History.
Maybe we would go watch one of the
presentations that are made at the na-
tional parks. No, that doesn’t happen
either. Woe on us here in Washington,
but all across this Nation, the national
parks are shut down.
Fish and wildlife, now, we have a real
problem here. The fish and wildlife ref-
uges in California are shut down, and
we are approaching the end of duck
season. Oh, my goodness. You mean we
can’t go duck hunting, as we might
want to do, at the fish and wildlife ref-
uges? That is right. You are not going
to go duck hunting at the fish and
wildlife refuges, as you have normally
done, even though you put your bid in
and you had January 15 for your date
to hunt ducks at the refuge. Nope,
can’t do that.
Transportation, the Department of
Transportation is shut down.
You tell me it is a small portion of
the Federal Government. Well, it is a

small portion of the budget, but it is 85
percent of the activities of the Federal
Government that are shut down: De-
partment of the Interior, Department
of Agriculture, Department of Home-
land Security, Department of Housing
and Urban Development, Department
of Transportation, and the Internal
Revenue Service.
Don’t worry, we can’t collect taxes.
That is a good thing, right? My con-
servative friend says you can’t collect
taxes, and that is all right. No, I want
my tax refund, and I can’t get that ei-
ther.
EPA, there are those who would
argue that that is all good. Well, I
don’t think so, not if you are concerned
about air and water, the ability to
swim in the rivers or to drink the
water.
Let’s just say you are going out for
your first tranche of funding. You need
SEC approval. Well, you are not going
to get it. The Securities and Exchange
Commission is shut down also.
Eighty percent or more of the activi-
ties of the Federal Government are
shut down.
There was a big headline in The New
York Times, the failing New York
Times, about the President and wheth-
er he is compromised. Well, I don’t
know. That will prove itself out one
way or the other with the Mueller in-
vestigation and all that is going on.
But I do know this, that if Putin
wanted to harm America, he would
shut down the American Government.
That is precisely what the President
did. He shut down the American Gov-
ernment for 25 days. What greater gift
would Putin want than an American
Government that is not functioning?
Oh, the military is still there, but
the fifth branch of the military is the
Coast Guard with 40,000-plus Coast
Guard members who are out there on
the water protecting the borders of
America. By the way, the Coast Guard
has confiscated 10 times the amount of
drugs that are confiscated on the Mexi-
can border. They are working without
pay. Essential services, yes, they are.
But the back-office services are not
working. They are laid off. Contractors
who have contracts to get a paycheck
from the Department of Transpor-
tation on the road that they are sup-
posed to be building or have built, it is
not going to happen.
It is time for us to open this govern-
ment. It is time for us to open the gov-
ernment and put America back to
work. Put the essential services back
to work.
The Food and Drug Administration is
shut down. Who is checking? Many of
my colleagues here have young grand-
children, infants. Who is checking the
quality, the safety, of infant formula?
The answer: No one.
Here we are. We are for border secu-
rity. We Democrats are for border secu-
rity. We have been for more than 20
years now. We voted for walls in the
past. We voted for improving the secu-
rity of the border in every way pos-
sible, and we will continue to do so.
But to hold America hostage, to hold
our government hostage, to hold 800,000
government employees and 40,000-plus
coastguardsmen and -women without
pay? No way.
To simply come in at the very last
moment in a negotiation that had been
settled and drop a $5 billion—excuse
me, it is $5.7 billion now; there seems
to have been an escalation—a $5.7 bil-
lion border wall on our process, it is
unconscionable.
We can open the government. Bills
have been passed here, not with the
help of our Republican friends, but
with the new majority. We have passed
legislation day after day after day to
fund the government. Some of it is
short term, as we did just an hour ago
here on the floor, a short-term CR to
open government until February 1 to
get people back to work and negotiate,
negotiate border security.
The President wants a wall. Where
does he want the wall? What kind of a
wall does he want: cyclone fence, steel
spikes, concrete? Where? For what pur-
pose? What is its effectiveness? What is
he trying to stop? Where is he trying to
stop that incursion into America? None
of that is available today.
I have been on the Armed Services
Committee for 8 years, 9 years now. We
would not build a hangar for the Air
Force unless we knew what its purpose
was, unless we knew where it was, what
it would cost, why it was necessary.
But the President wants a $5.7 billion
slush fund to build a wall somewhere
along the 1,900 miles of the border.
Now, a couple of my colleagues were
here a few moments ago talking about
the President’s desire to have a na-
tional emergency. Well, he sure as hell
created one. But I think he is talking
about those young children who are
climbing over the fences in diapers. I
suppose those are the terrorists he is
talking about.
b 1615
Madam Speaker, let’s talk about
what he proposes to do about it. He
would call for a national emergency
which gives him—he believes, we
don’t—but he believes the power to ap-
propriate funds. The Constitution is
very, very clear. There is only one part
of our government that has the power
to appropriate funds. It is us. It is the
Congress. But apparently the President
thinks he can declare a national emer-
gency and acquire the appropriation
power of Congress.
What does he intend to appropriate
for his purposes of the border wall?
America has had some flooding in
some of the districts of some of my col-
leagues that I see here on the floor. We
passed the emergency legislation to
deal with that. California has its
droughts, but it also has its rain. This
is the Oroville Dam. It is not subject to
the emergency appropriations for dis-
aster recovery. But the levees down-
stream from the Oroville Dam are sub-
ject to one of the appropriations in the
disaster recovery bill. If Oroville Dam
had broken, within 1 hour a city of
40,000, Oroville, would be under 30 feet
of water.
The levees downstream from Oroville
on the Feather River are in the process
of being repaired. Further downstream
as you get to Sacramento, Madam
Speaker, the American River and the
Sacramento River, major levee
projects, is the most flood-prone part
of America. I know there are some
friends from the Southeast here who
would debate that point. But let’s just
say there is a lot of America that is
subject to flooding.
This is a dangerous one. Money in
these supplemental appropriation bills
for disaster relief is designed to shore
up the levees of America.
Now, some folks would argue, yeah,
but it is not going to rain this year.
Maybe. Maybe it makes no difference.
But if it does rain, the repair of that
levee makes all the difference.
Here is a place that a lot of our
friends don’t care much about: Puerto
Rico. In the emergency disaster relief
legislation that the President wants to
raid is the repair of dams just up-
stream from San Juan, Puerto Rico.
This is what happened during the hur-
ricanes, and that dam spillway needs to
be repaired.
The communities in Texas, Cali-
fornia, the Carolinas, Florida, and the
Gulf Coast don’t want this to happen
again.
How do we save them from this ever
happening again?
It is to use the money that we have
appropriated for disaster relief to re-
pair the levees so that flooding is less
likely to happen. But the President de-
cides that he is going to create an
emergency declaration, and he is going
to go into the Army Corps of Civil
Works programs that were allocated as
a result of the appropriations from last
spring’s disaster relief legislation and
rip $21⁄2 billion out of those appropria-
tions.
Some of us have reason to suspect
with some evidence that he intends to
go after Puerto Rico and California. It
turns out that the projects in Cali-
fornia may be of interest to some of my
Republican friends, particularly the
minority leader, because one of the
projects is Lake Isabella just upstream
from Bakersfield, California.
So, Madam Speaker, we say to the
President: A, there is no emergency; B,
the shutdown of government is one of
your own making; and C, you don’t
have the power to appropriate money
yourself. Particularly, it is shameful to
take money that we have allocated to
protect Americans in Florida, Texas,
California, Puerto Rico, the Carolinas,
and even Missouri so that their levees
and so that their flood control projects
can be updated and improved and so
the safety of those communities can be
enhanced.
Here is what we want: we want gov-
ernment opened. It is inexplicable that
after 25 days this government is shut

down because the President is demand-
ing $5.7 billion for a border wall with-
out even telling us where that is going
to be built. Oh, excuse me. That is a
misstatement. It is going to be built on
the Mexican-American border.
Where?
Is it going to be built where there is
a real need?
What kind of a wall will it be?
That seems to change every 12 hours
because there are no plans worthy of
our—we are presumably responsible for
the taxpayer dollars—consideration as
to where, what the effectiveness would
be, what the usefulness would be, what
the cost would be, or even what the
color will be.
Open our government. Pass the legis-
lation in the Senate. The President
said he will veto it. Okay. Put it on his
desk. Let him veto it. He already says
he is wearing the mantle of the shut-
down. Let him put on another coat, an-
other mantle of a veto, so that the
American public knows precisely who
is responsible for this shutdown.
We have done our job here. We have
passed the legislation to fund this gov-
ernment—all but one department—for
the remainder of this fiscal year until
September 30, 2019. We have done that
multiple times now, and we have left
the issue of the Department of Home-
land Security in which the issue of the
border fence resides on a short-term
leash so that all of us would be forced
to come back to negotiate border secu-
rity.
Democrats would undoubtedly go for
improvements in the ports of entry.
One out of five cars is not checked at
the border. Maybe we ought to deal
with that. Only a few of the containers
arriving at our ports are checked. Most
are not. Maybe we ought to deal with
that. Maybe we ought to look at our
airports where we know most presumed
terrorists arrive.
So what are we doing here?
We are shutting down—we. Excuse
me. We are not shutting down. The
President is shutting down this govern-
ment for 25 days.
I can only imagine the joy in the
Kremlin. Consider for a moment Mr.
Putin, saying: Oh, my God. The Amer-
ican Government is shut down.
He couldn’t do it by himself. Only
our President would do it to us.
We have got things to do here.
I notice one of my colleagues, Mr.
LEVIN, has arrived, and I know he
wants to join us on this issue in a few
moments. In the meantime, I have got
a few more things to say.
To my Republican colleagues who
will soon follow me on this floor when
this hour is done, I can get pretty heat-
ed about some things, and maybe I
have been, but I want them to think
about what is actually happening here
in America and why we are in this situ-
ation.
My Republican colleagues had the
power over the last 2 years to build any
wall they wanted to build anywhere
they wanted to build it—Canadian bor-
der, Mexican border. They had the
power. They didn’t do it. Excuse me.
That is not right. I think 22 miles of
new wall have been built in the last 3
years. That is okay. I think the appro-
priation was somewhere less than $50
million for that. Now here we are.
I would love to hear my Republican
colleagues explain to the American
public how it came about that we are
in this situation when they had 2 years
to build whatever wall they thought
the President might want to build. It
didn’t happen.
I heard a wonderful and foolish—a
wonderful argument, because it was so
foolish—that gee whiz, $5.7 billion is
just a very small part of the total
American budget for expenditures.
That is true. It is a small part. That
is $5.7 billion.
Madam Speaker, $5.7 billion would
provide a year and a half of funding for
all of the tuition for every student at
the University of California and the 23
State universities in California—more
than 1 million students. Madam Speak-
er, $5.7 billion is no small amount of
money.
How many kids could you educate?
How much relief could we supply to
people who are hungry here in America
or some part of the world?
By the way, my Republican friends
did create a massive deficit when they
passed the tax bill last December—a
massive deficit. It will approach over
$900 billion this year. It just about dou-
bled the annual deficit with that piece
of legislation. I used to say the deficit
hawks migrate in December. My guess
is they are going to come back as we
deal with the new appropriation bill,
and as we do that, I would hope they
would keep in mind the $5.7 billion for
an unspecified wall in an unspecified
location of an unspecified height to
carry on an unspecified purpose—5.7
billion.
So let us continue for a moment. I
want to deal with one other thing. This
is the kind of thing that probably,
Madam Speaker, you have to see this
picture. This picture is worth maybe
500 words, but nevertheless I am going
to use 250 of them.
This is a picture of the President of
the United States and the Governor of
California at the Paradise fire. Some-
where around 16, 17,000 homes were de-
stroyed. Eighty-seven American citi-
zens were killed in that fire. An entire
community of some 25, 30,000 people is
gone. It just doesn’t exist anymore. It
is gone. It is ash. It is rubble.
Fortunately, Madam Speaker, the
American Government, you and I and
others and those who preceded us, de-
veloped a program called the Stafford
Act which provides the generosity of
Americans to help rebuild families and
communities such as Paradise, Cali-
fornia; or Redding, California which
also suffered a few thousand homes
burned and destroyed, not nearly as
many deaths fortunately.
b 1630
So the Stafford Act is what we know
as FEMA, Federal Emergency Manage-
ment Agency, the declaration at the
county level and at the State level of a
disaster, then at the Federal level of a
disaster, and then a presidential dec-
laration of a disaster.
The Federal Government then steps
in and begins to provide funding to re-
build, to help the individuals who have
lost everything, through the Small
Business Administration and some di-
rect grants, and to help communities
put back in place their infrastructure.
It is a wonderful expression of Amer-
ica’s empathy and generosity.
Two weeks ago my colleague Mr.
LAMALFA’s constituents, who has the
district just north of me, many of
whom now live and have found housing
in my area just south of Paradise, were
greeted with a tweet from the Presi-
dent.
I am going to paraphrase what the
tweet said; I don’t have it with me
right now. It basically said: I will stop
all FEMA funding until the State of
California properly manages its forests.
Madam Speaker, I must tell you, we
have seen tweet after tweet, and they
range from disgusting to awful and oc-
casionally one that you go: ‘‘Okay.’’
But with this one we said: What in the
world are you talking about, Mr. Presi-
dent? What are you tweeting about?
You are going to deny these people—
you were there, Mr. President. You
were there. You saw the devastation.
We counted the 87 people who died,
and they are still sifting through the
remains of these houses and may find
even more. You were there. And you
say you are going to cut off support
until California manages its forests
properly. You know not what you talk
about or tweet about, Mr. President.
The fact of the matter is that the
Federal forests which you oversee, Mr.
President, are the ones that are mis-
managed, for a whole variety of his-
toric reasons, many of which we have
actually made steps to improve here in
legislation.
So what is with this man that he
would wake up one morning and say:
No more help from the Federal Govern-
ment.
Does he think everything is about le-
verage? Is that what he thinks, that he
could use his power, awesome as it is,
to leverage something?
That is precisely what he is doing
with the wall. That is precisely what
he is doing with 25 days of this Nation’s
government shutdown. He is using the
citizens of America as leverage. He is
using the 800,000 employees, the De-
partment of Interior, the Department
of the Treasury, the IRS, the EPA, the
Department of Transportation, the
Coast Guard, as leverage for his border
wall promise.
It is despicable. It has got to end.
I need time to cool off.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN), my
colleague, who comes from an extraor-
dinary family.
And another generation has joined

Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam
Speaker, I appreciate Mr. GARAMENDI’s
leadership on this issue.
I don’t think there is—I have not
been able to find—another democratic
nation in our world that shuts down its
government over policy arguments,
wasting $1.2 billion of GDP a week for
no purpose.
Madam Speaker, I want to share a
few stories of the impact of this sense-
less shutdown on workers, on people in
my home State.
When we went home on Friday, I or-
ganized a meeting at our airport, De-
troit Metropolitan Airport, with a
range of Federal workers who have
been affected. We just wanted to listen
to them and hear their stories.
We invited FRED UPTON and my
Democratic colleagues from Michigan,
and those who traveled home were able
to make it.
I just want to share a few of those
stories.
There is Dave, a biologist at the
NOAA research lab in Ann Arbor. He
has been furloughed, not getting paid.
They study the water currents in the
Straits of Mackinac.
Line 5, our locally famous pipeline
that literally just goes in the water in
the bottom of the Great Lakes under-
neath the Mackinac Bridge, if that
breaks or has a rupture, the research of
this group is what determines how we
would fight that oil spill, which would
devastate the economy of the Great
Lakes.
That supercomputer is shut off. It is
just not working. And if we have that,
if there was an accident there, the
whole Midwest would be out of luck.
They run an experimental weather
computer that supplements the basic
work of the National Weather Service
and contributes to our weather fore-
casting. God forbid we have a huge
storm somewhere in the United States
where we get it wrong because they are
not doing their work; they are not able
to work. Just imagine some huge pile-
up of cars on one of our interstates
that happens because we are not doing
our best weather forecasting.
We heard from Mark, who is the
president of his local. He works at the
EPA lab in Ann Arbor. That lab is shut
down.
They are the ones who determine the
fuel efficiency of the cars you buy. Our
auto companies right now are not able
to move their cars forward toward the
market because they cannot begin to
sell a car until it has the EPA rating.
That EPA lab also does enforcement
of fossil fuel companies in our region.
That is not happening.
We heard from Wanavira, a TSA
agent for the last 21⁄2 years. She is a
veteran. So many of these people were
veterans. She is a veteran. She was a
Detroit cop for 10 years, and now she is
a TSA agent.
She had to go to the food bank to
make sure she had food for her family
because she is not getting paid. She is
being forced to work without pay.
We heard from Jennifer, another TSA
agent. She and her husband—I forget
which was which—one of them is 11
years and one of them is 16 years work-
ing for TSA. Friday was a pay-less pay-
day for the whole family, no income
coming in at all.
Her comment was: We have got this
week figured out. But next week—
meaning, the week we are in right
now—they don’t know how they are
going to put food on the table.
We heard from Youssef, who works
for the Customs service. He said his
friends think he is on vacation because
he has been furloughed by our govern-
ment. But his comment was that he
didn’t think a vacation included call-
ing your mortgage lender and your car
loan creditor to beg for a month of for-
bearance. He never thought that he
would get rich as a public servant, but
he also didn’t think he would have
trouble buying formula for his 5-
month-old daughter.
We heard from Angel, a computer
programmer for the IRS. She has twin
girls in college. They just started a
new semester. She has no money to
buy their books. She has no money to
buy their other supplies. She is another
veteran.
She herself has student loans. She
tried to go on edu.gov to figure out if
she could get a month off. Website
closed.
So we need to work hard to break
through to the Secretary of Education
to work with her to give forgiveness for
student loans for Federal employees
who are affected by this.
And, finally, I have got to share the
story of Tim. It is a frightening one be-
cause he inspects our planes, and half
of them are working and half of them
are furloughed, and they are not in-
specting our planes to the extent that
they normally do.
This is no joke. I do not want this
shutdown to end because our friends fi-
nally come to their senses after some
horrible thing happens to a plane, our
cars, or our food supply or something
that isn’t being inspected.
But Tim is a Navy vet who went to
work for General Motors. He lost his
job in the Great Recession.
Madam Speaker, in a previous life, I
created and ran something called No
Worker Left Behind. I ran the work-
force system of the State of Michigan,
and I created, essentially, the largest
experiment by any State in actually
putting workers back to school who
were unemployed or underemployed.
We put 162,000 Michiganders back to
school. This gentleman, Tim, was one
of them. He studied IT. And out of that
program in Oakland County, Michigan,
he got a job with the FAA. And here he
is, working without a paycheck now.
And so many of his coworkers are fur-
loughed.
He just wants to serve his country.
He has two kids in college, again, and
they need funding for tuition, books,
and so forth.
Madam Speaker, there is no reason
that 820,000 Federal workers are forced
to work for no pay or are simply off
without their livelihood. And so many
more government contractors are being
victimized, and so many small
businesspeople who run a restaurant or
a barbershop near a government facil-
ity are robbed of their income.
The economic effects are dev-
astating. There is no reason for it.
I appreciate Mr. GARAMENDI’s leader-
ship on this. I just wanted to come
down and join him in calling on our
colleagues in the Senate to join with us
in voting to reopen our government
right now. After all, we passed what
they had passed, what our Republican
friends had passed. It is not our appro-
priations, how we would want them, as
Democrats. We passed their appropria-
tions.
And in a bipartisan spirit, let’s re-
open our government, and we can have
all the negotiations we want over pol-
icy matters.
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for bringing our
attention to the real-life problems that
these employees have personally and
that are being created for Americans,
whether it is the weather or a broken
pipeline or an airplane that wasn’t in-
spected. It is very important that we
all know those things. I thank the gen-
tleman for joining us.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
BRENDAN F. BOYLE), my colleague, and
ask him to please share with us his
thoughts on the government shutdown.
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I applaud the
gentleman from California for leading
on this issue.
I find that there is a false perception
when it comes to Federal workers that
they are all based in the Washington,
D.C., area. We even heard some com-
ment to that effect from the President
not so long ago.
In fact, so much of our Federal work-
force is spread throughout the country.
In the Philadelphia metro area that I
represent, we have the fifth highest
number of Federal workers in the coun-
try. Furthermore, there are all those
who actually are impacted in some way
by this government shutdown, not just
the 800,000-plus who are going right
now without a paycheck.
My ask is very simple. I want the
Senate majority leader to allow a vote
on the same bill that passed unani-
mously—unanimously—in the Senate
just a few weeks ago.
On that Wednesday, it passed on
voice vote unanimously in the Senate.
We were here on Thursday morning,
prepared to vote on that same legisla-
tion.
But what happened between Wednes-
day afternoon and Thursday morning?
The President received a great deal of
criticism from his base, and then sud-
denly the bill that passed unanimously
from the Senate less than 24 hours
prior was not good enough, and now
here we are, stuck in the longest gov-
ernment shutdown in American his-
tory.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H587
January 15, 2019
I also want to make this point, be-
cause all of us in government so often
have gone from crisis to crisis to crisis.
This is a real systemic problem in
which we—all of us, regardless of
party—are shooting ourselves in the
foot and actually reducing now the eco-
nomic projection of our GDP growth
over the next year, completely need-
lessly. Almost every Western democ-
racy does not do it this way.
Once we get beyond the shutdown, a
bipartisan group of legislators should
look for a systemic fix to this and the
other sort of major way in which we
shoot ourselves in the foot, which is
when we actually come into danger of
not raising the debt ceiling and playing
really with fire.
These are mechanisms that most
other Western democracies don’t have.
They certainly have their partisan
fights; only, instead of two parties,
often, it is more than two major par-
ties.
b 1645
So I do think that once we get be-
yond this crisis, we do need to figure
out a way to prevent this from ever
happening again.
There are going to be different legis-
lators in these seats, inevitably all of
us will be gone. There will be the
switch of party control that has hap-
pened multiple times in this century
and will continue to happen.
We need to figure out a way to avoid
these needless government shutdowns
in the future that are only costly. They
hurt real people who are living pay-
check to paycheck—people, by the way,
who are Democrats, Republicans, Inde-
pendents, and nonvoters. And there is
really nothing to be gained out of these
government shutdowns.
So let us work together to end this
government shutdown. It is completely
unnecessary. It could end tomorrow if
there were willingness in the White
House and on the Senate side. And then
let’s also work together to ensure that
this is not only the longest government
shutdown in American history, but
also the last.
Mr. GARAMENDI. The gentleman is
quite correct about the nature of the
shutdown and the impact that it has on
Americans.
Can I be optimistic and encourage
him to figure out how to stop these
from ever happening again? And when
he grows a very gray head of hair and
a gray beard, perhaps he will have fig-
ured it out. It just hasn’t happened.
I was around for the 1995 shutdown. I
was the Deputy Secretary at the De-
partment of the Interior, number two,
and that massive Department which I
spoke of earlier, the parks, the Fish
and Wildlife services, all of those orga-
nizations—gone.
At that time, we did not have the re-
quirement that essential services
would be provided; there was just no-
body working. And that went on for, I
think, 23 days, which until this week
was the longest. It was a long time ago,
and here we are once again and in be-
tween. I think there are ways.
I notice many of my colleagues on
the Republican side are here, will soon
have the opportunity to take the floor
and will probably debate many of the
points or disagree with many of the
points that I have made earlier today.
I saw a few jaws clenching, biting down
on their teeth, just wanting to get in
the mix of it.
Mr. MEADOWS asked for time, and I
didn’t really want to hear that, but the
gentleman will have time in just a mo-
ment. I am not sure what he is going to
argue, but I would be pleased to hear
why this shutdown is good, why it is
necessary to keep the government of
America, the essential parts of the gov-
ernment—not the military. The Medi-
care checks continue to go out, and
that is happening. The military, De-
partment of Defense, we funded that
earlier, and that continues, and thank-
fully so.
But the Treasury Department, SEC,
EPA, Agriculture—I didn’t even get
into agriculture, although I have a $4.5
billion farm gate agricultural district.
They are hurting.
The crop checks that they need and
the assurance they need to their lend-
ers that they will be able to plant their
crops when the rainy season is over in
a few weeks, it is not happening now,
so that is delayed. And it may be, if it
goes much longer, they will miss their
planting opportunities.
Food stamps will soon be unavail-
able, and millions of Americans may,
under that circumstance, be very, very
hungry. Why is it worth it? Why is it
worth it?
Why don’t we start up government,
pass the legislation that is over in the
Senate, encourage, cajole, browbeat a
few Senators to pass the legislation,
put it on the President’s desk, and then
he can have that mantle of shutting
down the government once again very
clearly?
We will deal with border security. We
have over the years, and recently we
have done that and we will do it again.
But that is a negotiating process. We
negotiate on virtually everything
around here.
I have yet to get my way; but then,
I am one of seven children. I learned
very, very early, I don’t get my way
very often. I would like to participate
in that process of give-and-take.
And for proper comprehensive border
security, we know—I won’t speak
names. Perhaps that will get me in
trouble here. But more than one of you
sitting there and I have had conversa-
tions about border security, about im-
migration and how we could solve that
problem. That is going to take some
time, and surely there are places for a
fence or a wall or concrete or steel or
whatever, those places for improved
ports of entry, more personnel.
I haven’t even started to talk about
the children that were separated. That
will get me off on another thing that
wouldn’t be helpful now. But that
takes time, and you and I know that
we need to solve that problem.
So let’s start our government today,
tomorrow. Let’s prove to the world
that it really is an American Govern-
ment—not shut down but operating, all
of its good and all of its extraordinary
work and, occasionally, the mistakes
that it makes. But it is not operating
now.
And then let’s take the time over the
next 30 days, 60 days, whatever you
want to put on it, to negotiate real
border security, dealing with the immi-
gration issues, dealing with DACA,
dealing with fences and border ports of
entry, the kind of technology that is
necessary to know what is inside that
container, the kind of technology that
is necessary, and the kind of personnel
necessary to check not one of five cars
but every car and every truck and
every plane and every ship. We ought
to do that. But right now we are in the
heat of this, and we are not getting
anywhere.
So as he takes the floor in the next
hour, I will listen and our team will lis-
ten. I would ask him to encourage his
colleagues, our colleagues in the Sen-
ate, to pass the legislation that has
been sent to them, which is actually
the Republican appropriations bills,
take a very significant major step to-
wards reopening government, and then
let’s take the time to thoughtfully,
properly address a very complex, very
long-lasting problem in America: im-
migration, border security. I know
most of them, and I think that is what
they would really like to do.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair and avoid engaging
in personalities toward the President.
f
THE CRISIS AT THE BORDER
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. PERRY) is recognized for
60 minutes as the designee of the mi-
nority leader.
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I rise
to speak about the crisis at the border,
what is happening now, and what we
can expect if we don’t resolve this
issue.
I can’t help but comment on a few
things that my good friend, the gen-
tleman from California, said. And just
in case he wasn’t paying attention, we
are talking about 234 miles of border
security fencing or wall or barrier of
some sort as enumerated by the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security—not the
President; the Secretary of Homeland
Security.
So when he says it is unspecified
where it will be and what it will be, it
is very closely and very particularly
specified by the Secretary, not by the
President, and it is the 10 worst sites
along the border where there is no bar-
rier now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H588 January 15, 2019
Let’s get on with the other business
of the afternoon.
Madam Speaker, I am here this after-
noon with nearly a dozen of my col-
leagues in the House Freedom Caucus
who will lay out the case, with spe-
cifics, for the President’s policies on
border security, which are aimed at
keeping America safe and enforcing
our laws. These are for America’s poli-
cies.
The government has been shut down
for the longest period in modern his-
tory. It is shut down over the topic of
border security and whether to fund
the construction of a border wall on
points along our southern border.
Right now, our immigration is our
single greatest policy failure, a failure
that is a manufactured one. It was cre-
ated from political cowardice, short-
termism, and self-interest, but it is a
moral, legal, and human catastrophe of
epic proportions.
The President is fighting to fix it,
and the Freedom Caucus is fighting to
fix it right alongside him. Squarely in
our way is a party gripped by denial,
their political equivalent of hear no
evil and see no evil.
We learned as children that putting
your head in the sand doesn’t change
the reality of the situation, the facts
are facts. They don’t have a political
position. It is not about how we feel or
what we wish the facts are. They are
what they are.
Let me quote a recent Vox article, a
publication, mind you, that is no friend
to conservatives or the Trump Admin-
istration:
Hundreds, or even thousands, of migrant
families are set to be released from govern-
ment detention along the U.S.-Mexico border
over the next several days. But while the
mass release of families may cheer critics of
the Trump administration’s treatment of im-
migrant families, the government’s new plan
will probably lead to hundreds of families
getting dropped off en masse at bus sta-
tions—literally out in the cold.
Now the U.S. Border Patrol is so
jammed that it had to release these il-
legal aliens at a Greyhound station on
Christmas Eve. And that is not the
Border Patrol’s fault; it is an activist
judge in California who said that Cus-
toms and Border Protection must re-
lease these individuals. But there is no-
where for these families to go. Char-
ities at the border are full. Detention
facilities at the border are full.
Some more quotes from the same ar-
ticle:
But over the summer and fall of 2018, it has
become clear that there really is a crisis at
the border—because more families are com-
ing to more places than U.S. officials have
ever been capable of dealing with.
During the peak of unauthorized migration
into the U.S. circa 2000, the overwhelming
majority of migrants were single men; only
10 percent of Border Patrol apprehensions
were families or unaccompanied children.
In November 2018, 57 percent were families
or children. More families crossed the U.S.-
Mexico border without documentation in No-
vember of 2018 than in many months since
Department of Homeland Security started
tracking family apprehension separately.
More children and families crossed in No-
vember 2018 than crossed during the peak of
the ‘‘border crisis’’ in June of 2014.
This is Vox, mind you. This is anal-
ysis from a liberal publication. Let me
repeat the line.
But over the summer and fall of 2018, it has
become clear that there really is a crisis at
the border.
Again, this is from Vox.
Now, let me quote the Washington
Post, as you know, another great fan of
our President. This is an article from
January 5:
In recent weeks, so many parents with
children have been among the 2,000 unau-
thorized migrants who are being taken into
Federal custody each day that authorities
have resorted to mass releases of families
onto the streets of El Paso and other border
cities. U.S. agents are bringing dozens of mi-
grants, coughing and feverish, each day to
clinics and hospitals after stays in jam-
packed holding cells where children sleep on
concrete floors and huddle in plastic sheets
for warmth.
If this isn’t a crisis, can someone tell
me what is?
To all reporters hyperventilating in
TV studios who fact-check the Free-
dom Caucus and the President, I am
sure it is not a crisis; but to these print
reporters at Vox and The Washington
Post who did their jobs and reported
the news, this is a crisis.
The agency tasked with basic Federal
responsibility in this situation, Cus-
toms and Border Protection, lacks the
resources to do its job humanely and
effectively. They lack the legal re-
sources. They lack the financial re-
sources.
This is the current status quo. This is
why we are here. This is why nothing is
happening in Washington, D.C., about
ending this shutdown, because some
folks on the other side of the aisle, in
both this body and the one across the
Capitol, refuse to deal with the lack of
resources.
I ask my Democratic colleagues: Is
this what you support, this status quo?
Do you support leaving illegal foreign
nationals, human beings, on the streets
of the United States at bus stations
and by the side of the road?
b 1700
Do you support incentivizing them to
journey through one of the highest in-
tensity drug trafficking zones in the
world, where all manner of horrific
things occur? Do you believe this is
moral? I don’t. Neither does the Presi-
dent, who requested another $5 billion
for detention beds so we can protect
our borders and the illegal aliens who
violate them. It is in writing in this
letter from Director Vought at OMB,
which I will include in the RECORD.
EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESI-
DENT, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT
AND BUDGET,
Washington, DC, January 6, 2019.
Hon. RICHARD SHELBY,
Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: The President con-
tinues to stress the need to pass legislation
that will both reopen the Federal Govern-
ment and address the security and humani-
tarian crisis at our Nation’s Southwest bor-
der. The Administration has previously
transmitted budget proposals that would
support his ongoing commitment to dramati-
cally reduce the entry of illegal immigrants,
criminals, and drugs; keep out terrorists,
public safety threats, and those otherwise in-
admissible under U.S. law; and ensure that
those who do enter without legal permission
can be promptly and safely returned home.
Appropriations bills for fiscal year (FY)
2019 that have already been considered by
the current and previous Congresses are in-
adequate to fully address these critical
issues. Any agreement for the current year
should satisfy the following priorities:
Border Wall, Customs and Border Protec-
tion (CBP): The President requests $5.7 bil-
lion for construction of a steel barrier for
the Southwest border. Central to any strat-
egy to achieve operational control along the
southern border is physical infrastructure to
provide requisite impedance and denial. In
short, a physical barrier—wall—creates an
enduring capability that helps field per-
sonnel stop, slow down and/or contain illegal
entries. In concert with the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, CBP has increased its capacity
to execute these funds. The Administration’s
full request would fund construction of a
total of approximately 234 miles of new phys-
ical barrier and fully fund the top 10 prior-
ities in CBP’s Border Security Improvement
Plan. This would require an increase of $4.1
billion over the FY 2019 funding level in the
Senate version of the bill.
Immigration Judge Teams—Executive Of-
fice for Immigration Review (EOIR): The
President requests at least $563 million for 75
additional Immigration Judges and support
staff to reduce the backlog of pending immi-
gration cases. The Administration appre-
ciates that the Senate’s FY 2019 bill provides
this level of funding, and looks forward to
working with the Congress on further in-
creases in this area to facilitate an expan-
sion of in-country processing of asylum
claims.
Law Enforcement Personnel, Border Patrol
Agent Hiring, CBP: The President requests
$211 million to hire 750 additional Border Pa-
trol Agents in support of his promise to keep
our borders safe and secure. While the Sen-
ate’s FY 2019 bill supports some Border Pa-
trol Agent hiring, fulfilling this request re-
quires an increase of $100 million over the
FY 2019 funding level in the Senate version
of the bill.
Law Enforcement Personnel, Immigration
and Customs Enforcement (ICE): The Presi-
dent requests $571 million for 2,000 additional
law enforcement personnel, as well as sup-
port staff, who enforce our U.S. immigration
laws and help address gang violence, smug-
gling and trafficking, and the spread of drugs
in our communities. This would require an
increase of $571 million over the FY 2019
funding level in the Senate version of the
bill.
Detention Beds, ICE: The President re-
quests $4.2 billion to support 52,000 detention
beds. Given that in recent months, the num-
ber of people attempting to cross the border
illegally has risen to 2,000 per day, providing
additional resources for detention and trans-
portation is essential. This would require an
increase of $798 million over the FY 2019
funding level in the Senate version of the
bill.
Humanitarian Needs: The President re-
quests an additional $800 million to address
urgent humanitarian needs. This includes
additional funding for enhanced medical sup-
port, transportation, consumable supplies
appropriate for the population, and addi-
tional temporary facilities for processing
and short-term custody of this vulnerable

population, which are necessary to ensure
the well-being of those taken into custody.
Counter-narcotics/weapons Technology:
Beyond these specific budgetary requests,
the Administration looks forward to working
with Congress to provide resources in other
areas to address the unprecedented chal-
lenges we face along the Southwest border.
Specifically, $675 million would provide Non-
Intrusive Inspection (NII) technology at in-
bound lanes at U.S. Southwest Border Land
Ports of Entry (LPOE) would allow CBP to
deter and detect more contraband, including
narcotics, weapons, and other materials that
pose nuclear and radiological threats. This
would require an increase of $631 million
over the FY 2019 funding level in the Senate
version of the bill.
In addition, to address the humanitarian
crisis of unaccompanied alien children
(UACs), Democrats have proposed in-country
asylum processing for Central American Mi-
nors. This would require a statutory change,
along with reallocation of State Department
funds to establish in-country processing ca-
pacities at Northern Triangle consulates and
embassies. Furthermore, for the new proce-
dure to achieve the desired humanitarian re-
sult, a further corresponding statutory
change would be required to ensure that
those who circumvent the process and come
to the United States without authorization
can be promptly returned home. Without the
latter change, in-country processing will not
reduce the unauthorized flow or successfully
mitigate the humanitarian crisis.’’
These upfront investments in physical bar-
riers and technology, as well as legislation
to close loopholes in our immigration sys-
tem, will reduce illegal immigration, the
flow of illicit drugs entering our country and
reduce the long term costs for border and im-
migration enforcement activities.
The Administration looks forward to ad-
vancing these critical priorities as part of
legislation to reopen the Government.
Sincerely,
RUSSELL T. VOUGHT,
Acting Director.
Mr. PERRY. The President has asked
for $800 million for things like medical
care for these migrants, for transpor-
tation, for meals, and for short-term
custody facilities to deal with the in-
flow of illegal aliens our laws have
caused.
He has asked for 57 new immigration
judge teams to process these people,
hear claims with merit, and deal with
claims that do not.
And, yes, he asked for the wall to
cover the 10 worst sites, as described by
the Department of Homeland Security,
to prevent entrants from pouring
across the border, especially in the
dead of winter and the extreme heat of
summer.
These are rational measures, and
they are humanitarian measures.
The cheap and disingenuous mor-
alism of the Democrats in Congress has
brought us to this point. They have op-
posed every one of these proposals to
improve this system, not only in this
Congress, but in every Congress before.
This is the same posturing that is
worsening this crisis, and I will say it
again: This is a crisis.
Now, our colleagues on the other side
of the aisle have a clear choice to
make. They can bow to the demands of
their radical base that believes there is
no difference or distinction between
citizen and noncitizen, or they can
come to the table to work with the
President, which is our job; to protect
the vulnerable, including the 30 percent
of women who are sexually assaulted
on the trek to the U.S.-Mexican border,
the children who are preyed upon by
human trafficking rings, and the inno-
cent who are trying to make a better
life for themselves but live in fear of
the drug cartels and many others; to
protect our borders; and to protect
American citizens.
They can provide Immigration and
Customs Enforcement the tools, legal
and financial, to do its job.
What is not up for debate is whether
the children shivering on the floor be-
cause we can’t house them is a crisis.
That is the bottom line here.
Even worse, American families are
losing loved ones at the hands of illegal
foreign nationals under preventable
circumstances—preventable, com-
pletely preventable.
Earlier today, we heard from Angel
Moms, a sister and a brother, American
citizens who lost loved ones because we
aren’t enforcing our immigration laws.
This is completely and wholly unac-
ceptable.
We are a compassionate nation and a
nation of laws, but the same laws apply
to all of us. It is not this law for some
and this law for others. We cannot
allow ideology to prevent us from ad-
dressing the crisis. The situation is too
dire for these people at risk, and the
situation for America is critical.
Tonight, the House Freedom Caucus
stands with the President, and I am
proud to stand with my colleagues to
make the case to the American people.
Madam Speaker, we will next hear
from Mr. CHIP ROY on the effectiveness
of walls, and then we will hear from
Mr. BROOKS from Alabama on the dan-
ger of these uncontrolled border poli-
cies to Americans, followed by Mr.
BIGGS from Arizona on what it is like
to live in an unsecured border because
he lives in Arizona.
We will hear from Mr. HICE on
opioids and the way our porous borders
contribute to that crisis that is affect-
ing every single town in the country.
We will hear from Mr. GRIFFITH. We
will also hear from Mr. YOHO; Mr.
MEADOWS, our great chairman, the gen-
tleman from North Carolina; as well as
Mr. CLOUD from Texas.
This evening, we are going to get be-
yond the talking points and specifi-
cally lay out our case.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ROY).
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Pennsylvania for
yielding.
Madam Speaker, as a proud Texan, I
am proud to give my first remarks on
the floor of the United States House of
Representatives today on the impor-
tant issue of border security, critical
to my district and critical to the State
of Texas and our Nation.
Hundreds of thousands of people seek
to come to this country, both legally
and illegally, each year. They are
drawn to the hope of the greatest free
society the world has ever known. But
we are in danger of losing that which
separates us from the other nations of
the world, the rule of law. Nowhere is
that more pronounced than the chaos
and the lawlessness of our southern
border.
Freedom cannot flourish in chaos.
Prosperity cannot emerge from fear.
Yet, we have failed to secure our Na-
tion because Members on both sides of
the aisle have buried their heads in the
sand over the last several decades,
talking instead of doing. Americans are
weary of our opinions and ready to see
us do the job we were sent here to do.
This isn’t about numbers or statis-
tics. It is about people. It is about
Jared Vargas, a vibrant young college
student studying computer science
with dreams of working in the cyberse-
curity field. His life was cut tragically
short when he was brutally murdered
by an illegal alien in San Antonio last
June.
Jared’s mother, Lori; his twin broth-
er; and his younger sister don’t care if
I personally believe fences would be
more effective than drones, or vice
versa. And they don’t care if one of my
colleagues believes that 2,028 homicide
charges against illegal aliens in 2018 is
not enough to justify a border wall.
For them, one matters enough.
The Vargas family does care that
Jared’s murderer had been in ICE cus-
tody twice and had been arrested for a
DWI and released just a month before
he killed Jared.
This current debate before us has a
face. It has a name. That name is
Jared. And his family wants justice for
Jared.
But it is also about the little girl
who, today, will be exploited by drug
cartels who know that sex trafficking
can be more lucrative than trafficking
drugs.
It is about the young woman in Cen-
tral America who saves money and
pays every last dime she has to some-
one who promises to take her to a bet-
ter life in America, only to be forced
into a shipping container. She wakes
up in Greece to find that she has been
sold into the sex trade, and there is no
one around her who speaks her lan-
guage.
According to Doctors Without Bor-
ders, roughly one-third of women mak-
ing their way across the border are vic-
tims of sexual assault. I am old enough
to remember, as a Senate lawyer, when
Senator Tom Coburn spoke on the Sen-
ate floor in 2007 about rape trees. I find
it unacceptable that today, a decade
later, the border is littered with the
clothes of new victims because we have
failed to do anything as a body, as a
Congress.
In my visits to the border, one thing
is clear: Dangerous cartels are calling
the shots. I was talking to a Border Pa-
trol agent last summer. He said:
I am down here at night. I am by myself.
I have no cell, no radio. I can’t see the river

through the thick cane. I can’t drive along
the river. And the cartels have operational
control of the border.
That is what we are sending our guys
down on the river, in the Rio Grande,
to do to defend this Nation.
So it is time for us to put partisan-
ship aside and secure our border.
Fences, cameras, radios, cell phones,
more Border Patrol agents, additional
immigration judges, cleared cane, navi-
gable roads along the river, we need all
these tools.
To be clear, that is what is in the
President’s plan. That is what we are
fighting to get. To be clear again,
fences are a vital and necessary part of
that security.
It is absurd for anyone to argue that
fences do not work, take your pick of
an example throughout history, from
the walls around medieval fortresses to
the fencing around the White House
and our military installations today.
Ask a tort lawyer whether leaving
your pool open, monitored by drones,
will save you from liability if a child
falls in your pool.
The truth is, fences have worked
since the dawn of time. Currently, we
have 46 miles of reinforced fencing
along the San Diego sector of the bor-
der. Before construction began in 1986,
there were 630,000 arrests. Compare
that to almost 32,000 arrests in 2016.
Fences work. Yet, 10 years ago, I
heard members of the Senate Judiciary
Committee argue that fences don’t
work because migrants then shifted
from California to Arizona, New Mex-
ico, and Texas.
Only in Washington is that logic
passable. Fences don’t work because
they worked? That may have been the
first time, though it won’t be the last,
that I heard someone say fencing is a
1st or 3rd or 18th century solution for a
21st century problem.
But in El Paso, in Yuma, in Tucson,
in Israel, fencing was put in place, and
we have seen reductions of up to 90 per-
cent or more in illegal crossings.
This body has repeatedly authorized
foreign assistance to our allies to help
them secure their borders. But, at the
same time, the House is crippled with
inaction at securing our own.
We have repeatedly authorized fenc-
ing for the United States of America,
but we are here today trying to actu-
ally get it funded and get it built. It is
time to stop posturing about things
that everybody in America knows.
In Texas, let’s stop talking. Let’s go
down to Brownsville. Let’s start build-
ing the fence where we need it and
work our way up the river.
To my colleague who was speaking
early about, well, where is the fence
going to go? If we face an obstacle,
let’s discuss it. If a rancher needs ac-
cess to water, we consider leaving an
opening, post a guard, put up a camera,
and then continue moving up the river.
Let’s work together for one simple
goal. The United States of America
should have operational control over
its borders, not dangerous cartels.
Many on both sides of the aisle like
to pretend that we shouldn’t build a
fence because it might be possible to go
over or under it. Of course, that is pos-
sible, but that is not a reason not to
build a fence.
The fundamental question is this:
Are we more secure with agents and
drones, or are we more secure with
agents, drones, and fences?
This is not a partisan issue; it is a
humanitarian crisis. It is time for us to
stop bickering or hiding behind excuses
and secure the border now.
It is time for America to reclaim
operational control of its border, pay
Federal workers who are doing their
job, and make America secure again.
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield to
the gentleman from North Carolina
(Mr. MEADOWS), the chairman of the
Freedom Caucus.
Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania for his leadership.
Madam Speaker, I rise today because
we have just heard, an hour before we
came on the House floor, more debate
about opening the government than we
actually have had people negotiate to
actually open the government.
You know, there are all kinds of rea-
sons why everyone is saying that the
government is shut down, but the big-
gest reason is because no one is willing
to negotiate on the other side of the
aisle.
I can tell you, the President, 16
blocks from here, was sitting here over
Christmas and over New Year’s, and,
indeed, he was sitting here last week-
end when 30 of my colleagues from
across the aisle went to Puerto Rico on
a junket with lobbyists to talk about
how important the government shut-
down must be to them.
Well, I can tell you that the biggest
fallacy in all of this is that all the per-
ils that my colleagues opposite seem to
demonstrate, and the urgency that is
there, I haven’t seen the urgency.
We come in; we get sworn in; and
what happens? They go home. The sec-
ond weekend, what happens? They go
to Puerto Rico.
Even today, while the President in-
vites Democrat colleagues to go 16
blocks from here and negotiate on how
we may solve this, what do they do?
They turn down the President.
Now, I can tell you, Madam Speaker,
that there are a lot of things that are
said on this particular House floor, but
none more appropriate than today
when we have our colleagues who were
suggesting that this is easy to fix.
They are exactly right. It is easy to fix.
All we have to do is provide a little
funding for border security and build a
wall, because what we have at stake
are the lives of innocent people.
Madam Speaker, I looked in the face
of moms today who had lost their kids.
It truly broke my heart to think that,
here we are debating this issue, and
yet, for some reason, my colleagues op-
posite won’t give a single dime.
Let’s find a single Democrat who is
willing to give any amount of money to
border barriers, and let’s have a nego-
tiation.
But you know what? You can’t find
them. You can’t find them, not because
they are in Puerto Rico. You can’t find
them because they have built a wall be-
tween them and fair compromise.
So, Madam Speaker, I am here today
to suggest that we are here willing to
negotiate. We are here willing to open
back up the government, but not until
the Democrats are willing to meet us
halfway.
I can tell you, this President stands
ready to make a deal, but, quite frank-
ly, it has been only one side of the
equation willing to negotiate.
I thank the gentleman for his leader-
ship. I thank all my colleagues for
being willing to stand up.
Let’s get this done right. Let’s secure
the border once and for all. And let’s,
indeed, make America safe again.
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.
BROOKS).
b 1715
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Madam
Speaker, in 2018, more than 2,000 illegal
aliens were apprehended by Federal law
enforcement officers for homicides
committed on American soil; that is
roughly 2,000 dead in just 1 year. And
that does not count some number of
the 70,000 Americans whose lives are
snuffed out each year by poisonous
drugs, much of which is shipped ille-
gally into America across our porous
southern border.
Americans would know more about
these horrific killings if the media di-
verted just a fraction of the time it
spends on extolling illegal aliens and
attacking our brave border patrol and
ICE officers and agents to telling the
stories of American lives needlessly
ended by illegal aliens and our porous
southern border.
Today I share a few stories about
those who died solely because of illegal
aliens and our porous southern border.
Louise Sollowin was a beloved moth-
er, wife, and grandmother. Louise
spent 50 years helping her sister fire up
the oven at Omaha, Nebraska’s, Orsi’s
Italian Bakery, where she worked well
into her 80s.
In 2013, after 93 years of life, Louise
was brutally raped and beaten to death
by an illegal alien. To make matters
even more horrific, Louise’s daughter
found her bleeding, battered, and dying
mother with a naked illegal alien
passed out on top of her.
In 2010 in Houston, Texas, 14-year-old
Shatavia Anderson was shot in the
chest and killed by two illegal aliens.
Shatavia loved her family and loved
talking on the phone. She proclaimed
that one day she was ‘‘gonna be some-
body.’’ Shatavia was robbed of that
dream by illegal aliens.
In July 2018 in my hometown of
Huntsville, Alabama, two drug-cartel
related illegal aliens took Oralia Men-
doza and her 13-year-old grand-
daughter, Mariah Lopez, from their

home in the dark of night. Oralia was
stabbed to death while her teenage
granddaughter, Mariah, was forced to
watch. Later, and in order to eliminate
a witness, the illegal alien drug cartel
members then beheaded Mariah and
abandoned her body in the woods not
far from where I live. Mariah’s decay-
ing body was not found for weeks.
Mariah was a special needs student at
Challenger Middle School. Her teachers
described her as a ‘‘sweet little girl’’
who ‘‘had a lot of friends.’’
I have a Washington staff member,
Michaila Lindow, who well remembers
being baby-sat as a young child by fam-
ily friend, Tad Mattle. In 2009 in Hunts-
ville, Alabama, then 19-year-old Tad
Mattle was driving home with his
girlfriend from a church social. While
stopped at a traffic light, an illegal
alien, who was fleeing the scene of yet
another crime and whose blood alcohol
content was three times the legal
limit, rear-ended Tad Mattle’s car.
This illegal alien had three prior DUIs.
Tad Mattle’s car exploded on impact,
tragically killing Tad Mattle and his
girlfriend. Tad, the oldest of three chil-
dren, enjoyed making music and served
as percussion leader in the Grissom
High School marching band. Three
days before he was killed, Tad was
awarded a full scholarship to the Uni-
versity of Alabama in Huntsville,
where he planned to pursue an engi-
neering degree.
Mr. Speaker, each of these horrific
deaths have one thing in common: none
of these lives would have been stolen
from us, but for illegal aliens aided and
abetted by Democrats who protect,
promote, and prefer the lives of illegal
aliens to the lives of American citi-
zens.
Mr. Speaker, these killings on Amer-
ican soil will continue if America does
not secure our porous southern border.
As for those who support amnesty
and open borders, how many American
lives and dreams must be snuffed out
by illegal aliens before Washington has
the guts and integrity to secure our po-
rous southern border? How many
Americans, dead Americans, does it
take before you will start saving lives
rather than aiding and abetting those
illegal aliens who take them?
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Alabama
and yield to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. HICE).
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, I thank my good friend, the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania, for his
leadership on this.
I am honored to be a part of this
group dealing with a problem that we
all know is a reality and yet so few
seem to be willing to do anything
about.
We have thousands of new aliens en-
tering our country every day, and this
surge of illegal immigrants flooding
across our porous borders puts our Na-
tion at risk in more ways than one.
In 2017 alone, more than 900 Ameri-
cans died every week from the opioid-
related crisis and overdoses. Every
American, everyone in this chamber
knows personally someone who has
been affected by this, be it a family
member, a friend, a coworker, a neigh-
bor, where the opioid crisis has pene-
trated into these lives. And its ad-
vancement continues to march down
the streets of our Nation.
The story of the opioid epidemic cer-
tainly begins many times with pre-
scription pain medications, pharma-
ceutical companies, pill mills, overpre-
scribing, many of these kinds of ways,
but today we see the opioid crisis being
driven by the widespread availability
of cheap, powerful drugs like heroin,
often laced with synthetic opioids like
fentanyl.
Make no mistake about it: this is a
human tragedy. It is a family tragedy.
It is a national tragedy. It is a national
crisis that we are facing right now,
largely because of loopholes that we
have in our immigration laws, but also
unquestionably because of the physical
barriers that don’t exist. As a result,
we have illegals continuing to storm
into our country and bring with them
all sorts of illegal activity.
Earlier today, I stood alongside my
colleagues and met many angel fami-
lies who have been so personally im-
pacted, have lost loved ones because of
our deeply flawed immigration policies
and so forth.
One in particular I met today Susan
Stevens. Susan had a daughter, Vic-
toria, who 1 year ago next week lost
her life. She was a cheerleader, she was
an artist. She was a vibrant young lady
whose life was taken from this world
largely because of our inability to deal
with and stop the smuggling of illegal
drugs coming into our country and to
secure our border.
We have all heard the statistics.
Nearly 90 percent of heroin coming into
our country comes into our country
from the southern border, 90 percent.
Sadly, stories like Victoria Stevens’
are becoming all too common; we are
hearing these stories on a daily basis.
I am stunned when my colleagues on
the other side look at the President’s
cry at this national crisis at our border
as some sort of political stunt. This is
no political stunt. This is reality.
Two weeks ago we all watched as
Speaker PELOSI jokingly made the
claim that she would be willing to give
a single dollar to secure our border. I
would remind the Speaker, this is no
joking matter and this is no laughing
matter. These are real lives. This is a
Nation that is being impacted by her
refusal to deal with the issue at hand.
This country ought to be a safe haven
for law-abiding citizens, but instead we
are watching communities that have
become vulnerable and susceptible to
crime.
How many more families need to lose
loved ones before we take action? How
many more families will no longer hear
the laugh of their child because we are
not taking action right here, before we
secure our borders? What is it going to
take? The Mexican cartels are a cun-
ning enemy, and yet Democrats refuse
to acknowledge the situation. They
call it a manufactured crisis.
I guarantee you, had they been there
today with these angel families, they
would not have left saying this is a
manufactured crisis. They would have
been pricked to the heart of the reality
of what we are facing in this country.
And yet they refuse to come to the
table. They refuse to come with real
solutions. They refuse to compromise
at all.
Instead, as has already been men-
tioned, this past weekend they go to
Puerto Rico on a virtual vacation
while hundreds of thousands of Amer-
ican workers are losing their pay-
checks, being held by Democrats off on
a vacation at an island getaway.
The Democrat playbook is nothing
but obstruct at all costs. And, again,
this was played out today while the
President invites them to the White
House, and they refuse to show up yet
again, showing what they are really
made of. And they refuse to deal with
our borders.
More than 49,000 Americans died last
year from heroin and opioid-related
overdoses, and yet the Democrats, with
their open border policies, refuse to
deal with this situation.
I am convinced that they are becom-
ing accomplices in the countless deaths
yet to come by their refusal to deal
with the dangerous drugs, illegal ac-
tivities, and our broken borders.
This is precisely why we must deal
with the President’s request for a bor-
der wall and to do so immediately. The
consequences are too dire. We cannot
continue to wait.
We are here today committed to en-
sure the integrity of our borders and
the safety of the American people
through the building of the wall on our
southern border. We are here today
fighting for the families of the victims
who want a reasonable immigration
system to protect our children and our
grandchildren.
Tackling this immigration problem
and protecting American families from
criminal aliens is a fundamental re-
sponsibility and duty that we all have,
and I am honored to stand with my col-
leagues to press this issue and to call
the Democrats to come to the table
and deal with the issue.
Madam Speaker, again, I thank my
friend; I appreciate so much the time.
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman. I yield to the
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN).
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding to
me.
Madam Speaker, you know why we
can’t get a deal on the border security
wall? You know why we can’t get a

was never that great, and they cheer on
MAXINE WATERS when she says go out
and harass anyone who supports the
President.
Today’s left thinks that America is
just another country, just one of the
190-some countries on the planet.
Madam Speaker, the United States of
America is not just another country. It
is the greatest Nation in history that
has done more good for more people
than any country ever; a special place,
a special place where people from all
over the world, all shapes, all sizes, all
colors, all talents come to so they can
chase down their goals, chase down
their dreams, make life better for
themselves and their family.
That is this country: a special place,
where people come and respect the
Constitution, cherish the Bill of
Rights, and embrace the rule of law.
But today’s left, specifically on this
issue, Democrat Congressman BLU-
MENAUER said, abolish ICE; Secretary
Clinton, when she was running for the
highest office in the land, said we need
a borderless hemisphere; Speaker
PELOSI said walls are immoral. And
just last week, Stacey Abrams, Gov-
ernor candidate from the State of
Georgia, said noncitizens should be
able to vote. Think about that: nonciti-
zens should be able to vote.
Americans believe, Republicans be-
lieve, the House Freedom Caucus be-
lieves that borders need to be strong.
Americans believe, we believe that
there is a difference, a big difference,
between legal immigration and illegal
immigration. And Americans and Re-
publicans and the House Freedom Cau-
cus believe that a border security wall
will help stop the drug problem, the
gang problem, and the human traf-
ficking problem.
b 1730
Mr. Speaker, this is not just a fight
about a border security wall. It is big-
ger than that. It is about those funda-
mental values, those fundamental prin-
ciples, that make us the greatest Na-
tion in history.
The House Freedom Caucus and the
House Republicans stand with our
President. We know there needs to be a
border security wall. We know this
needs to happen to deal with all the
things that have been talked about.
That is why we are here. That is why
this is important. That is why this
fight is so fundamental. And that is
why it is important we stand with the
President of the United States and
make sure it gets done.
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield to
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.
BIGGS).
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank
my friend from Pennsylvania for orga-
nizing this.
To be honest with you, I really can’t
believe we still have to have this con-
versation. The idea that the United
States of America should turn a blind
eye to protecting its national borders
violates one of the few responsibilities
enumerated to the Federal Government
in the Constitution, the one we just
swore an oath to just a couple weeks
ago, to ensure the security of our Na-
tion and provide for its defense. How
can anyone argue that we are safer as
a nation by not having any idea who is
entering our country today?
Unlike many Members of Congress, I
was born and raised in southern Ari-
zona, mere miles to the Mexican bor-
der, not too far away, an hour or so
drive. I have met with Border Patrol
agents and ranchers who live in the re-
gion several times alone recently.
There is no other way to put this: The
situation on the American side of the
border is dire and equally as grave on
the other side.
For 8 years under the Obama admin-
istration, the Federal Government ef-
fectively told Americans that their
safety and their sovereignty were not
important. They told Border Patrol
and ICE agents that the jobs they were
doing were essentially pointless, be-
cause the Obama administration was
going to find as many ways as possible
to prevent further border security and
circumvent the immigration laws
passed by Congress, including reducing
the pay of Border Patrol agents.
If the House Democrats have their
way, they will continue down this sub-
optimum, irresponsible path until it is
simply too late.
I visited the 75-mile stretch of the
border that crosses through one of Ari-
zona’s Indian reservations. Along the
way, the Border Patrol agent who was
guiding us pointed out drug shacks and
lookouts that the cartels use to alert
smugglers of the Border Patrol’s pres-
ence. It is astounding, quite frankly.
Some will argue that there is fencing
along many of those miles and try to
convince you that the area is secure
and no fencing is necessary. But let me
tell you something, that is not true.
The fencing consists of a single strand
of barbed wire. There might be some
Normandy barriers, those cross bar-
riers, now and then, and there is some
pole fencing, all of which easily can be
walked over or stepped through. No one
who has been there can argue with a
straight face that the ability to walk
across the border with little effort can
be called secure.
On that same trip, I met with cattle
ranchers near Nogales. Each of those
families has encountered multiple ille-
gal aliens on their property—in fact, on
a regular basis. It is so grave that they
set up cameras so they could capture
footage of the illegal traffic. I have
seen that footage; I have seen the vid-
eos. It is not groups of sweet mothers
and children coming across. It is
groups of armed, young men, with
drugs strapped to their backs, 50-pound
packages. They are wearing carpet
shoes to disguise their footprints in the
dirt.
I recently spoke with a rancher along
the border. He has told me that he has
been victimized by three home inva-
sions and more than a dozen burglaries,
not counting the near constant tres-
passes that victimize his family.
I am curious to know what the open
border advocates think about that kind
of traffic. Should known drug smug-
glers have the freedom to traipse
across private property and come into
America? These Americans own their
land, but the House Democrats see no
reason to protect them from this inva-
sion.
To any Member of the Chamber who
disagrees with border security, or
doesn’t know how to describe it, in-
cluding with a wall, how would you feel
about constant trespassing and vandal-
izing of your own property? Don’t you
think the government should do some-
thing about it, or should we just turn a
blind eye?
During a more recent trip, I had
lunch with about 15 rank-and-file Bor-
der Patrol agents working in southern
Arizona. These are the men and women
defending our borders every day. They
are putting their lives on the line,
chasing after armed drug smugglers
and being assaulted by illegal aliens
they encounter.
By the way, just a couple of weeks
ago, there was one attacked who had
his face broken open by a rock after he
was bitten and punched and attacked.
Let me tell you, it leads to low morale
in the agency.
They are the only DHS law enforce-
ment agency that received a pay cut
under the previous administration, and
we can’t fund them back yet. I don’t
understand that.
When they hear Members of Congress
condemn the work they are doing and
advocating instead for lawlessness and
open borders, these agents have little
incentive or motivation to continue
fighting for our Nation’s security.
This morning, I stood, like others
have mentioned, with Angel Families
who have lost loved ones. Two of them
are in my district, the families of Bran-
don Mendoza and Grant Ronnebeck.
They have suffered unjust harms. They
have lost their children.
When I hear the gentleman from
California say, oh, we can’t get to the
Smithsonian museum, well, for these
people, their children will never get to
the Smithsonian museum. They will
mourn, and they do grieve. I am thank-
ful for them standing up.
I will just tell you, ladies and gentle-
men, there is a crisis on the border. We
must deal with this with courage.
I call on my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle to quit being obstruc-
tionists. We have to fund a border wall
and the border security asked for.
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.
GRIFFITH).
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker,
‘‘Facts are stubborn things; and what-
ever may be our wishes, our inclina-
tions, or the dictates of our passions,
they cannot alter the state of facts and
evidence.’’
John Adams made that statement al-
most 250 years ago. I recall his words

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H593
January 15, 2019
when House Speaker PELOSI, in arguing
against more funding for security at
the southern border, claimed that
President Trump was ‘‘manufacturing
a crisis.’’
The facts on the border establish
that a crisis exists. According to the
Department of Homeland Security
data, 161,000 family units arrived in fis-
cal year 2018, an increase of 50 percent,
and 60,000 unaccompanied children ar-
rived in the same time period, an in-
crease of 25 percent. Asylum claims
have surged an astounding 2,000 per-
cent in the past 5 years, although most
of these claims will be found invalid
later, after judicial review.
These surging numbers are over-
whelming our resources on the border
and creating a humanitarian, security,
and legal crisis.
The Mexican side of the border is
often controlled by Mexican criminal
cartels or gangs. They charge a fee to
assist border crossings. To get here,
many illegal immigrants put them-
selves in the hands of these vicious
smuggling gangs, which are looking for
profit and are uninterested in basic
human dignity.
On the dangerous journey to the bor-
der, 7 out of 10 migrants suffer from vi-
olence, and 31 percent of women and 17
percent of men are sexually assaulted.
Too often, the fees these gangs charge
are indentured servitude in the sex
trade. Porous borders only encourage
more business for the criminal gangs
who commit these abuses.
Further, more than people are being
brought across the border, as you have
heard. Increased amounts of illicit sub-
stances are entering as well. Meth,
trafficked across the border by these
cartels into places across the country,
including my district in southwest Vir-
ginia, increased by 38 percent from fis-
cal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018. That
same period saw a 22 percent increase
in heroin and an astonishing 73 percent
increase in fentanyl.
Even when current security measures
intercept people crossing the border il-
legally, there isn’t enough room in fa-
cilities to detain these individuals
until a judicial hearing can be held.
Accordingly, most illegal immigrants
are released with notice to appear at a
hearing in the future. By the time of
the hearing, they have either dis-
appeared back into the clutches of the
cartels or into the underground econ-
omy.
In my opinion, these facts classify
the situation on the southern border as
a crisis.
President Trump has asked for $5.7
billion to build a barrier on the south-
ern border, and additional funding for
personnel. What is more, he is willing
to negotiate with the Democrats in the
House and in the Senate. Congressional
Republicans are also ready to com-
promise.
In contrast, Democrat leaders refuse
to budge. They say they will give no
money for a wall. Speaker PELOSI even
called a wall immoral.
Her views on a barrier’s immorality
may come as a surprise to many on her
side of the aisle. When Congress voted
on the Secure Fence Act, which pro-
vided for 700 miles of fencing in 2006, it
received the support of 64 Democrats in
the House and 26 in the Senate, includ-
ing CHUCK SCHUMER, now the Senate
Democrat leader, and then-Senators
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
Instead, she appears afraid to get to
yes on a deal with the President.
Speaker PELOSI appears to be afraid to
get to that deal.
Another objection she has raised to
the wall is that illegal drugs and other
smuggled goods also come through our
legal ports of entry rather than across
the border. President Trump responded
by including an additional $675 million
to combat smuggling at the ports of
entry.
Further, Democrats say the govern-
ment should be reopened before they
can come to the table. But when debat-
ing immigration last summer, the
House Democrats never offered a com-
promise on a wall. When debating
spending bills this fall, House Demo-
crats never offered to compromise on a
wall.
For 30 years, the American people
have been promised a barrier on the
southern border. Particularly for the
last 4 months when the government
was, in fact, open, the last 4 months of
2018, House Democrats didn’t offer a so-
lution. Why should anyone believe now
that, if the government is reopened,
they will suddenly find a way to com-
promise?
Reaching a compromise is difficult
when one side doesn’t admit there is a
problem. A porous border has caused a
crisis.
I urge Speaker PELOSI to come to the
table. Let’s talk about ways to secure
the border, protect the American peo-
ple, end the humanitarian crisis, and
reopen the government.
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.
YOHO).
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Pennsylvania for
yielding on such an important topic.
I am glad to be here tonight because
I think it is important that we go out
and make our case to the American
people and tell the truth, which is not
what you are going to hear in the
media or from our Democratic col-
leagues, as we have heard earlier
today.
The government now has been shut
down for 25 days, breaking the record
for the longest partial government
shutdown in history. We would like to
express our empathy and concern for
those affected, and may this be re-
solved sooner than later.
Why has this been so long? Because
Democrats refuse to come to the table
to negotiate a solution. Instead, they
would rather bring up messaging bills
that don’t fund vital programs. Also,
they can say they didn’t support Presi-
dent Trump’s border wall.
In fact, today, we passed a bill that
passed in the House that we passed last
Congress. It was on hatred and hate
speech and all that. They won’t address
this issue. They want to walk away
from this.
They don’t want to support President
Trump’s border wall so they can go to
their constituents and say they won.
This is all about the 2020 Presidential
election. They aren’t concerned about
border security or the security of the
American people.
This is not a game. We are not talk-
ing about a game. We are talking about
the rule of law, security for the Amer-
ican people and our Nation.
This President has been confronted
with an unprecedented degree of ob-
struction from the Democratic Party.
President Trump has asked the Demo-
cratic leadership if they would nego-
tiate over the wall if the government
was reopened. Speaker PELOSI said no.
She has said over and over again that
walls are immoral and not one penny
for a wall.
Ms. PELOSI, I am asking you, and the
American people are asking you, to do
what is right: negotiate border security
and pay our patriotic workers who
aren’t getting paid.
This obstruction is unnecessary and
hypocritical. How is funding for border
security unreasonable? The answer is
that it isn’t.
b 1745
Democrats have supported fences at
the border in the past. In 2006, over half
the Democratic Senators, including
Hillary Clinton, CHUCK SCHUMER, and
Barack Obama, voted to build 700 miles
of security fence; 138 Democratic House
Members voted for that bill.
Democrats must realize the impor-
tance of border security but would
rather sacrifice security for political
gamesmanship. This is a matter of na-
tional security and can no longer be ig-
nored.
On average, 2,000 inadmissible, illegal
migrants arrive at our southern border
daily. That means, in the last 25 days,
approximately 50,000 illegal migrants
have sought entry at our border with-
out going through the proper channels.
And there are proper channels.
I remain a strong supporter of border
security and will continue to defend
the need for this essential funding. Our
porous border and weak enforcement
laws have allowed for illegal immi-
grants to go unchecked. Liberal cities
and liberal States with liberal policies
supported by our liberal colleagues
continually put Americans in jeopardy.
Just last night, three MS–13 gang
members were picked up and arrested
for assault on a 16-year-old. Their ages
were 20, 19, and 17. All three were gang
members of MS–13. Two of them had
been previously released by a Federal
judge, and all confirmed that they
came into this country in 2016 under
President Obama’s illegal DACA pro-
gram.
If you talk to the Democrats, they
tell you that $5.7 billion is too much to

pay for protection at our southern bor-
der; but what they won’t tell you is, if
the U.S. were to grant amnesty or a
path to citizenships for all illegal
aliens currently living in our country,
it would cost an estimated $2.6 trillion.
That is an easy choice from the per-
spective of $5.7 billion as the price to
pay for our national security.
We are facing unprecedented obstruc-
tionism from the Democrats, and we
can’t reward them by backing down.
We can and will win if we continue to
fight.
When I talk to people in my district,
when you can break down why are we
here, what our cause is, and what our
principles are, they support us. People
on the border that are border security
guards support us.
That is why I believe the Democrats
will have to come to their senses and
negotiate as more and more Americans
support our view from what you have
heard here today. I appreciate the
Freedom Caucus for standing up and
pointing these things out.
Meanwhile, this shutdown wore on
through the weekend, and I along with
my Republican colleagues stayed in
town to end it, but the Democrats
chose, instead, to go to Puerto Rico to
party with over 100 D.C. lobbyists while
calling on non-U.S. citizens to be able
to have the right to vote, and they
watched the play, ‘‘Hamilton.’’
It is no wonder we haven’t been able
to negotiate a deal with the Demo-
crats. They won’t deal. In the face of
their refusal to negotiate, we don’t
have any choice. I and my colleagues
are prepared to be here through the
weekend, every weekend, until we can
put enough pressure on the other party
to be reasonable and come to a solu-
tion.
The right thing to do is to negotiate.
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Florida, and
I now yield to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. CLOUD).
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Pennsylvania for
yielding.
This debate over securing our border
has become a debate over the morality
of our efforts, and I welcome that de-
bate. But if we are to debate this issue
of border security on the basis of mo-
rality, it is fair for us not only to ask
how this issue affects our own Nation,
but to look across our border and see
how our national policy affects those
beyond our borders.
For those of us who live near our
southern border, we understand all too
well the effects of the criminal cartels
who profit from abusing our Nation’s
generous immigration laws.
When I visited the Rio Grande Valley
just recently, a rancher with land on
the border described the situation, say-
ing that he finds dead migrants on his
land all the time.
In my hometown of Victoria, Texas,
19 migrants died of suffocation and
overheating after being trapped in the
back of a trailer abandoned by a smug-
gler with a callous disregard for human
life.
But beyond our borders, these cartels
carry an outsized influence in Mexico
and in developing nations in Central
America. We know that cartels profit
from smuggling drugs and humans
across the border. They siphon oil from
pipelines. They extort families and
businesses and kidnap for profit.
The barbarism of these criminal car-
tels has led to 150,000 homicides in
Mexico, alone, since 2006. They have
worked their corrupting influence into
the halls of government and law en-
forcement, hindering the people of
these nations from developing and real-
izing the blessings of liberty for them-
selves.
Our Federal Government’s unwilling-
ness to control our border allows car-
tels to amass profits of tens of billions
of dollars each year smuggling drugs
and humans into our country, with a
devastating toll on the most vulnerable
in our Nation. Our lack of border secu-
rity allows these criminal cartels to
wield their corrupting influence in a
way that makes positive change so dif-
ficult in these developing countries.
Unfortunately, like too many issues
these days, border security has become
a divisive and a partisan issue when,
historically, this has had broad sup-
port. But there should be nothing par-
tisan about ending a humanitarian and
criminal crisis that is driven by cartels
and enabled by our Federal Govern-
ment’s failure to act.
Congress has a responsibility to pro-
tect the citizens of our country and to
end the humanitarian crisis on our
southern border, and it is past time to
reform our broken asylum system and
secure the border.
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Texas for
being part of this discussion.
Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to
how much time I have remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania has 3 min-
utes remaining.
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOH-
MERT).
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, we
hear that walls don’t work, yet this is
a picture of the Democratic National
Convention in 2016. They put up a bar-
rier. They put up a fence because they
wanted to protect themselves like peo-
ple in America want to protect them-
selves.
And there is a lovely gate, wall. They
have them everywhere there is some-
thing that needs to be secured. Every
single Democrat who is standing
against securing our border has an
outer wall to their home.
If walls don’t work, they can elimi-
nate that. People can come and go as
they please. But they know deep down
in their hearts, they secure their dead
bolts. They secure their home. They
may even have a wall around their
outer wall because walls work.
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend
from Pennsylvania for yielding to me.
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.
GOHMERT) for sharing his thoughts on
this topic.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON).
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from
Pennsylvania for yielding.
Madam Speaker, our bodies should
unite to stop the violent cartels and
drug lords who have taken advantage
of the humanitarian national security
crisis on our southern border. Border
security is national security, and we
need to be doing everything we can to
secure our southern border.
For years, our senior Border Patrol
officials have made modest requests for
tactical barriers. The President’s re-
quest prioritizes the top 10 of 17 pri-
ority areas that Border Patrol wants to
secure.
The men and women patrolling our
borders put their lives on the line
every day to keep us safe from ter-
rorism, drug trafficking, sex traf-
ficking, gunrunning, money laun-
dering, and all sorts of dangerous
crimes. They routinely encounter some
of the most dangerous criminals and
traffickers anywhere in the world.
They seize drugs that would have
otherwise made it onto Ohio streets
where we are dealing with the tragedy
of this opioid crisis that has killed far
too many of our friends and neighbors.
They have also arrested illegal aliens
who were charged and convicted of
crimes, including sexual assault, kid-
napping, and homicide. A significant
percentage of women and girls entering
the country illegally are raped.
We should be giving our personnel on
the border the resources they need to
get the job done. Nevertheless, millions
of Americans want to participate in
this great cause. They have contrib-
uted private funds and would like to
give directly to our government.
That is why I introduced the Buy a
Brick, Build the Wall Act, which would
allow the Treasury Department to help
fund this wall and make sure the re-
sources go to the cause that so many
people support. We need to unite and
secure our border.
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time.

in this Chamber just thinking about
the history of our Nation and the his-
torical moments that have taken place
in here.
I love giving tours of the Capitol to
constituents when they come. I bring
them into this Chamber and, as they
sit here, I share with them that it is
from this rostrum behind me that
President Franklin Roosevelt gave his
day of infamy speech.
We walk down the hallway and we go
to the rotunda, the magnificent ro-
tunda that has portraits hanging in the
rotunda that depict the history of
America. I share with them about how
this is the greatest legislative body in
the history of the world.
We have become the envy of other
nations, our deliberative bodies, for the
strength of America and all that we
have accomplished in this Nation, the
mind-boggling things that we have ac-
complished, from aerospace to business
and the ingenuity of America, because
of the strength of our freedom that has
been built by a legislative body that
brings the different sides together and
negotiates to come up with solutions,
solutions that are good for America.
Our strength isn’t because we have
always agreed. No, we, quite frankly,
disagree. And our disagreements go
back to the beginning of our Nation.
In that rotunda is a portrait por-
traying a turning point in American
history, a very critical part of Amer-
ican history. It happened during the
Second Continental Congress, when our
predecessors, those who came before
us, the representative body that we
now represent, were faced with a very
critical decision. That decision was
whether to vote in favor of declaring
independence against Great Britain.
There were strong advocates, very
strong advocates in favor of independ-
ence. One of those was John Adams
from Massachusetts. John Adams was
strongly in favor of independence and
spoke very passionately of voting in
favor of independence. But just as
strongly as John Adams was in favor of
independence, you had John Dickinson
from Pennsylvania who also was as
strongly opposed to independence.
They continued to debate all aspects
of whether they should declare inde-
pendence. And, in fact, there were oth-
ers who disagreed, even to the point
where the first vote for independence
failed.
But Dr. Benjamin Franklin under-
stood the power of negotiating, the
power of compromise, the power of
bringing two sides together, and he
began to negotiate. He began to bring
the sides together. And by the time
they took the second and final vote for
independence, he had garnered enough
votes to actually pass the motion to
declare our independence from Great
Britain.
Now, the difference between John
Adams and John Dickinson wasn’t that
they disagreed on the problem they
were facing. No, they both agreed that
there were atrocities committed on the
American Colonies by Great Britain.
They only disagreed on how to deal
with it.
As I mention that, and as you know
from history, the second vote barely
passed. John Dickinson remained op-
posed to declaring independence. In
fact, he voted ‘‘no’’ on the resolution
when it was brought before the floor.
However, as soon as the resolution
passed, John Dickinson left Philadel-
phia, and he joined the fight for inde-
pendence.
b 1800
We are at an impasse here in this his-
toric Chamber today, not because we
have a differing opinion, but because
we are even refusing to come together
to lay out the facts, to lay out the
ideas, and to lay out the various solu-
tions to this problem.
We are the greatest, most powerful,
and most influential legislative body in
the world. We have been the envy of
the entire world. Other nations have
modeled or tried to model their legisla-
tive bodies after ours. But we should be
embarrassed to where we are today be-
cause the system is broken, and it isn’t
broken because of a design flaw. It is
broken because of what we have turned
this into. We have broken the system
because we have chosen to ignore our
own rules, our own laws, and our own
procedures.
Most Americans may not realize it,
but we have a deadline. We have a
deadline every year of September 30 to
fully fund the government. But the last
time that was done was in the 1990s. We
have continued to kick the can down
the road. Every September we get to
the point that we just do a continuing
resolution, and we put it off to another
date and to another date until we get
to a point that creates a crisis and we
must fund the government. Then some-
body holds the funding of the govern-
ment hostage for whatever political
partisan reason that they want.
The 4 years I have been in Congress I
have worked diligently with others to
try to change this status quo system of
ignoring our own laws, rules, and pro-
cedures and consolidating the power of
appropriations to just a few who get to
call the shots and allow others to hold
the American workers, the citizens,
and the businesses that rely on those
workers who were furloughed, hold
them all hostage in our political par-
tisan wrangling. I don’t like where we
are. I don’t like the way the process is
broken. We should not be here because
we should have fully funded the entire
government before the end of Sep-
tember.
Now, to give credit where credit is
due, over the last couple of years the
House Republicans have made great ef-
forts to try to accomplish that. In 2017,
we were actually able to pass all 12 of
our appropriations bills out of this
Chamber before the deadline. It didn’t
happen in the Senate, but we were able
to do it here. This year we made an
even greater accomplishment; we
passed several of them. We passed five
out of here that also went to the Sen-
ate. The Senate passed it. It went to
the President’s desk, and he signed it.
But it is those remaining appropria-
tions bills that have us where we are
today, because we did not follow our
own rules.
I don’t like it. Most of the Members
I know on our side don’t like it. My
dad, a World War II veteran, used to
give me a piece of advice. He said: Son,
if there is something in life you don’t
like, you have two choices. You can do
something to change the situation or
just accept the status quo and go on
with your life. But complaining never
accomplishes anything.
We are at an impasse where two sides
have dug in on what they both claim
are ideological principles. Let’s look at
where we are. One side, the Republican
side, believes that the drug trafficking,
the weapon trafficking, human traf-
ficking, sex trafficking, and terrorist
travel coming across the border is a na-
tional security and humanitarian cri-
sis. In fact, the Vice President, when
he met with us last week, used those
words, that this is a national security
and a humanitarian crisis we have at
the border. The President of the United
States also agrees that we have a crisis
at the border.
However, the other side that is also
dug in, the Democrats, don’t believe
that we have a crisis. In fact, the talk-
ing points of the day have been, as you
heard earlier, that the crisis has been
manufactured, that the desire to build
a border wall or a physical barrier is a
vanity project for the President, or as
one reporter stated as he was at the
border, he said: Things are tranquil
here.
So we have one side claiming a crisis,
and the other side claiming conspiracy.
I believe we do have a crisis at the
border. I believe that that crisis is real
and that crisis has been going on for
quite some time. As you can see on the
board next to me here, I am not the
only one who believes that, not only do
we have a crisis but we have had a cri-
sis that has existed for quite some
time.
The President of the United States in
2014 stated: ‘‘We now have an actual
humanitarian crisis on the border.’’ In
fact, what he said was: ‘‘We now have
an actual humanitarian crisis on the
border that only underscores the need
to drop the politics and fix our immi-
gration system once and for all.’’
Now, some of you who are watching
on television right now will look at
that and immediately attribute that to
our current President, President
Trump. But if you think back, Mr.
Speaker, the President of the United
States in 2014 was President Barack
Obama. He is the one who said: Yes, we
do have a crisis. It is a humanitarian
crisis at the border.
But today my Democratic colleagues
on the other side say that the crisis
doesn’t exist, that it is manufactured,
and that it is a conspiracy. It really
doesn’t exist. Things are tranquil.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H596 January 15, 2019
Well then you have to ask the ques-
tion: What changed?
We must have done something sig-
nificant during that time period. But
nothing has changed. We still have the
status quo when it comes to our border
and border security.
In fact, President Obama went on to
say: ‘‘In recent weeks we’ve seen a
surge of unaccompanied children arrive
at the border, brought here and to
other countries by smugglers and traf-
fickers.’’
‘‘The journey is unbelievably dan-
gerous for these kids. The children who
are fortunate enough to survive it will
be taken care of while they go through
the legal process, but in most cases
that process will lead them to being
sent back home.’’
This is exactly what our current
President is saying. We have a humani-
tarian crisis as well as a national secu-
rity crisis. In fact, for the 4 years I
have served in Congress, I have been
saying that our crisis at the border
should not be categorized just as an
immigration crisis, but it is a national
security crisis.
When I served on the Homeland Secu-
rity Committee, we had many briefings
by the then-Obama administration De-
partment of Homeland Security who
went through all of what was going on
at the border, the crossings at the bor-
der, the drugs, the weapons, and who
they were intercepting, and I identified
at that time that we had a crisis at the
border.
But this issue at the border goes be-
yond even the time I have been in Con-
gress. It has been going on for decades.
It is a decades-old problem that be-
cause of status quo, because of the bro-
ken system that we are working under,
because politicians are comfortable
with the status quo, we have not done
anything to address it.
In 2006, I was serving in the State
legislature in Georgia. I was a young
businessman who didn’t like the way
things were going in the State, so I
took the advice of my father that if
there is something in life you don’t
like, do something to change the situa-
tion. So I ran for the State house, and
I was elected.
We were dealing with issues in Geor-
gia of immigration. In fact, a young
man by the name of Dustin Inman had
lost his life because an illegal immi-
grant driving drunk hit the car killing
Dustin Inman and permanently making
his mom disabled. It appeared to us
that the Federal Government, the Con-
gress in Washington, D.C. wasn’t doing
anything to fix the situation, so a
group of legislators got together.
We said: Look, we may have to ad-
dress some of this on our own. So we
will go to the border. We will spend
several days at the border to see what
is going on ourselves.
While I was at the border, I spent
time with Border Patrol agents. We
went up and down the border. They
showed us where the physical barriers
were working, but they also showed us
where they had problems, and it was
usually where the physical barrier
ended. They shared with us the lack of
funding that they had and the lack of
adequate Border Patrol agents. They
told us of the dangers that they were
facing, but they also told us the frus-
trations of catch and release.
We also spent the night with a ranch-
er, after we had met with several resi-
dents who lived along the border. They
were telling us the horrific stories of
crime that were going on on their prop-
erty and in their neighborhoods, be-
cause of the cartel activity going on at
the border. While we sat at this ranch-
er’s home that evening—because of the
lack of the adequate number of Border
Patrol agents, he had to set up his own
security systems and surveillance sys-
tems just to protect his property and
protect his employees on his ranch.
We sat in his home that evening
watching on infrared night vision cam-
eras. You could see coyotes, those who
were helping to bring illegals across
into the United States, as they would
congregate inside of Mexico and they
would move up to where there was a
physical barrier, a border wall.
I asked him: At this point, what is
going to happen? Are they going to
scale the barrier?
He said: No. They are just staging.
All they are going to do is move a few
miles down that wall to where the wall
doesn’t exist, and they will walk right
across into the United States.
That is exactly what happened. We
watched as they came into the United
States, they ran to a gully, and they
hid in a gully until somebody came and
picked them up. By the time the Bor-
der Patrol was able to get there, they
were long gone.
I kept a journal. The other day I
went back, and I pulled that journal
out from 2006. I was reading over my
experiences, and I got to the last entry
of that journal that I wrote when I got
home. That journal said: I believe the
government in Washington, D.C.,
doesn’t want to solve the problem at
our southern border.
Again, they are happy with the sta-
tus quo.
Americans have been asking Con-
gress to do something, not just about
illegal immigration but about the
drugs coming across into our Nation.
As you heard earlier, the Department
of Homeland Security has intercepted
enough fentanyl used in opioids to kill
nearly two-thirds of the entire popu-
lation of the United States. They want
us to do something about the sex traf-
ficking, other drugs coming across the
border, weapons, criminal activity,
human trafficking, and terrorism, the
terrorists who are traveling across the
border.
But we can’t solve any of these issues
nor reopen this government until we
are willing and ready to come together
and have a national debate, a debate
about the merits of each side. Each
side needs to come forward and present
what their priorities are and what
their ideas are for the solutions.
Republicans have done that. We have
laid out several different ideas and sev-
eral different solutions. We have yet to
hear anything from our colleagues on
the other side except for the word no.
We must lay out our priorities. We
must lay out our ideas, not just hurl
insults at each side.
Then we must debate, and the debate
must be based on truth, on facts, not
perceptions and not accusations. It has
to be based on what is best for the
American people, not what is best for
the politicians or political victory or
preparing for the next election.
If we are going to get to this place
there has to be some things that take
place. First of all, we have to have
meetings, we have to have discussion,
and we have to have negotiation. Just
as Dr. Benjamin Franklin did at the
onset of this Nation, he brought the
parties together in meetings. They
began discussing, and then they started
negotiating. That is how they came up
with compromise.
You have to have all three. You can’t
have one without the other. You can’t
have a discussion without first having
a meeting.
Two weeks ago, congressional leaders
were invited to the White House to;
first of all, have a meeting to discuss,
Where do we go from here to end the
shutdown; to do something about bor-
der security; to move forward?
But the answer given to the Presi-
dent when he asked was: Are you will-
ing to negotiate border security which
includes building a physical barrier?
The answer was no, end of story, end
of discussion.
Meetings aren’t effective unless you
actually are able to have a discussion
and both sides are willing to negotiate.
Mr. Speaker, you also have to be able
to deal with facts. Both sides have to
be able to deal with facts. Again, the
President invited leadership of the
House to the White House to the Situa-
tion Room to discuss the facts and the
issues that you have heard several of
here tonight.
However, as the Secretary of Home-
land Security began to go through
these issues one by one, she was inter-
rupted by the Speaker of the House,
Ms. PELOSI, and was told that she
wasn’t interested in hearing the facts.
In fact, according to a news media re-
port, it was, ‘‘I reject your facts.’’
Secretary Nielsen said: ‘‘These aren’t
my facts, they are the facts.’’
So we have to be able to deal with
the truth, the facts. One question that
I am always asked back home is: Your
colleagues on the other side of the aisle
continue to say they are for border se-
curity, they are for national security
and they just don’t want a wall.
Well, that is a question I have. So
when the Democrats rejected the facts
that came from the Department of
Homeland Security about the atroc-
ities that are going on, the criminal ac-
tivities going on at the border, the
President took it upon himself, and he
sent it to Members of Congress. Imme-
diately upon receiving this data, my

colleagues and my friends on the other
side started dismissing the data.
b 1815
When it came out in 2017 that the De-
partment of Homeland Security inter-
cepted 3,755 terrorists, that number
was immediately challenged. And the
other side was quick to point out, well,
not all of those were caught at the bor-
der.
And they were right; not all were
caught at the southern border. In fact,
they properly pointed out that many of
them were caught at our ports of entry
at airports, so we should focus in that
area and not on a border wall, even
though a number were caught at the
border.
Well, that is fine. They say they are
for border security; however, I question
that because, when President Trump,
in his first year in office, identified
this very problem, that we had terror-
ists coming in from nations that are
known to harbor, train, and fund ter-
rorists and he tried to put a travel ban
on people coming in from those coun-
tries, the Democrats objected to it and
actually took it to court and tried to
stop him from actually implementing
that.
So it leads to the question: Do they
really want border security?
When the statistic came out that
6,000 illegals associated with gangs
have been apprehended by ICE, again
my colleagues challenged that statistic
and brought up that, well, only 800
gang members were actually appre-
hended at the southern border—only
800.
Just the other day, the district attor-
ney of one of the largest counties in
Georgia said that the greatest threat
to Georgians today is gangs. And, as we
started looking at how do these gang
members come in, our colleagues on
the other side adequately pointed out
that most of these gang members were
not coming across the border, but they
were here as a result of visa overstays.
‘‘But we really do want border secu-
rity, so we should address that.’’
Last year, H.R. 4760, in June, was
brought to this floor, which actually
made visa overstays a Federal mis-
demeanor, but my colleagues on the
other side—every one of them—voted
against that bill.
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity also put out the statistic that
17,000 adults were detained at the
southern border with criminal records.
The other side has made the argument
that these are just families that want a
better life.
Again, they have rejected the facts.
So my question is: Do they really want
border security? Are they really will-
ing to come to the table and lay out
what their priorities for border secu-
rity really are?
Is it port security at our airports?
Well, obviously, they opposed the
President when he took that route.
Is it addressing visa overstays? Well,
obviously they voted against that bill
when we brought it forward.
Do they really want to keep the gov-
ernment open and address border secu-
rity? Well, they all voted against the
continuing resolution the Republicans
brought to the floor back in December
and opted to close the government.
Do I believe that my colleagues want
terrorists to come into the Nation? No,
I do not.
Do I believe they want more gang
members to infiltrate our commu-
nities? No, I don’t believe that is what
they want.
I don’t believe they don’t think that
there is a crisis at the border. I just
think that they are happy with the sta-
tus quo.
You see, this city often runs on peo-
ple who have learned how to navigate
the swamp. They learn how to use the
status quo to their advantage.
And if you go back and you look over
the history of this Nation, especially
the modern history of this body of Con-
gress, we are still debating several of
the issues that we were debating 10, 15,
and 20 years ago. It seems that these
become campaign issues more than
they are issues that we want to resolve
for the American people. Why? Because
we don’t want to address the status
quo.
What we have in the White House
right now is a President whose main
objective is to change the status quo in
Washington, to change the way we do
things. Those ideas I support because
what we are doing now is broken. The
way we are doing it now is broken.
There is only one way out of this sit-
uation. It is for my colleagues from the
other side of the aisle to actually agree
to attend the meetings.
In fact, the President opened up the
White House today for another meeting
to start discussing and hopefully get to
negotiations, but the leadership on the
Democratic side refused to even show
up.
We offered several compromises last
year in December to avoid the shut-
down, but the resounding response we
received from the other side was ‘‘no.’’
Every attempt that we have brought to
this floor to try to resolve the situa-
tion at the border has been met with a
resounding ‘‘no.’’
At some point, we have to get away
from our own partisan political wran-
gling and understand that what we are
doing is for the safety and the security
of the American people. It is time to
quit just saying ‘‘no’’ and say ‘‘but if.’’
I appreciate every person who was
elected to represent the American peo-
ple, but now is the time to sit down, to
have a discussion, and to begin to nego-
tiate so we can reopen the government
and, more importantly, ensure the
safety and the security of all Ameri-
cans.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. STE-
VENS). Under the Speaker’s announced
policy of January 3, 2019, the Chair rec-
ognizes the gentleman from South
Carolina (Mr. RICE) for 30 minutes.
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. YOHO).
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I would
like to thank my colleague and great
friend, Mr. RICE, for allowing me this
opportunity. The gentleman is truly a
man of the people.
Madam Speaker, 25 days, 25 days the
government has been shut down—25
days—making this the longest shut-
down in U.S. history.
Why has this been so long? It is be-
cause the Democrats refuse to come to
the table and negotiate a solution. In-
stead, they would rather bring up mes-
saging bills that don’t fund vital pro-
grams, all so that they can say they
didn’t support increased border secu-
rity.
Well, let’s take a look at the last 25
days.
On the average, 2,000 inadmissible
migrants arrive at our southern border
daily. That means, in the last 25 days,
approximately 50,000 illegal migrants
have sought entry at our border with-
out going through the proper channels.
And there are proper channels.
Additionally, in December, 27,518
family unit aliens were apprehended
for crossing the border illegally. If
those numbers remain consistent, that
means over 21,429 family unit aliens
have been apprehended for illegally
crossing in the last 25 days.
In fiscal 2018, 2,028 illegal aliens ar-
rested had homicide charges. If this
number remains consistent, that
means 139 homicide charges for illegal
aliens in the last 25 days.
Further, on an average, 300 Ameri-
cans die per week from heroin, and 90
percent of that heroin in the U.S.
comes through our southern border.
That means, in the last 25 days, ap-
proximately 1,000 Americans have died

because of heroin illegally crossing our
border.
This doesn’t even include the amount
of fentanyl that crossed our southern
border in fiscal year 2017, which was
enough to kill every single American
via overdose.
If you talk to the Democrats, they
will tell you $5.7 billion is too much to
pay for protection at our southern bor-
der, but what they won’t tell you is
how much more it costs the Federal
Government and American citizens by
not securing our border.
The argument the Democrats want
you to believe is that this argument is
strictly about the border wall. There-
fore, they fear, if President Trump gets
any funding for the wall, they lose, like
this is some kind of game that we are
playing to win.
This is about them wanting power
and winning the White House in 2020—
shameful.
This is about border security, period.
Democrats, I ask you to do what is
right: Come to the negotiating table to
end this shutdown. You don’t lose, but
America wins.
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam
Speaker, Americans pay the price for
our failure to secure our southern bor-
der in many, many ways. Our failure to
control our southern border is a na-
tional disgrace.
Some of the ways Americans pay for
our failure is through illegal immigra-
tion, reduced wages from illegal immi-
gration, drugs, violent crime, human
trafficking, gangs, abuse of our welfare
system, and potential terrorism.
There are too many to explore here,
but I want to focus on just a few of the
larger problems. One is illegal immi-
gration.
First, I want to say I am not anti-im-
migration. I am anti-illegal immigra-
tion.
You have to understand that, as a
sovereign country, we have the right to
decide who and how many people are
allowed to become citizens of our coun-
try. And we are a very, very generous
nation. Don’t let anybody tell you
that, because we are against illegal im-
migration, we are not a generous na-
tion.
We accept 1.1 million legal immi-
grants per year. That is almost twice
as much as the next highest country—
1.1 million legal immigrants per year.
Now, we can talk about that number—
is it too high, too low—but that is what
the law allows.
Most countries use their immigration
system to make themselves more com-
petitive, and that is what I am all
about: make America great again,
make the United States competitive
again. You see, a competitive economy
makes America the land of oppor-
tunity, and I am all about opportunity
for my children and grandchildren and
your children and grandchildren.
Most countries use the immigration
system to make themselves more com-
petitive by using high-skilled immigra-
tion. In other words, if you have a skill
set or an educational background that
that country needs, you go to the front
of the line.
Our immigration system, on the
other hand, is based on chain migra-
tion. Only 12 percent is skill based.
That is less than half of what the aver-
age developed country provides. Can-
ada and Mexico base much more of
their immigration on skill set than we
do here in America.
The result of our chain immigration-
based system is that primarily low-
skilled, uneducated people are admit-
ted through our legal immigration sys-
tem. In fact, over half of our legal im-
migrants—legal immigrants. I haven’t
even gotten to illegal immigration yet.
Over half of our legal immigrants end
up relying on our welfare system, and
this clearly makes us less, not more,
competitive.
President Trump and I agree that we
should shift to a skill-based immigra-
tion system like Canada and Mexico
have to grow our economy and create
more opportunity for our children and
grandchildren.
So all that is bad enough, that we
base our immigration on chain migra-
tion, that 65 percent of the folks com-
ing in here have a low skill set and
over half of them end up on welfare,
Medicaid, food stamps, and the like,
but now let’s talk about illegal immi-
gration.
On top of that 1.1 million primarily
unskilled legal immigrant workforce
that we bring in every year, we have a
flood of illegal immigrants. Nobody
knows exactly how many, but it is hun-
dreds of thousands of folks. The low
end of the estimates is 300,000 to 400,000
people per year on top of the 1.1 million
that we admit legally.
In a 2015 study, Harvard Professor
George Borjas found that legal immi-
gration, that 1.1 million legal per year,
added 25 percent to the low-skilled
workforce over the last 20 years.
b 1830
Then you add illegals on top of that.
Professor Borjas said, for every 10 per-
cent you add in competition, you re-
duce wages by at least 3 percent.
Folks, if you add 25 percent more
competitors, wages will go down. That
is Economics 101.
If you look at this chart, this is a
chart of wage increases in the United
States from 2000 until now. You can see
those folks at the upper end of the
scale. They are not really affected by
low-skilled illegal immigration, and
their wages went up and went up sub-
stantially.
If you look at the 75th percentile,
they are not affected either. Their
wages went up and went up substan-
tially.
But the median income, they are flat.
They haven’t had a raise in 20 years.
The people at the 25th percentile and
the 10th percentile, they haven’t moved
at all. They are the people who are the
most hurt by illegal immigration, by
competition from low-skilled illegal
immigrants who work for nothing and
who cheat hardworking Americans out
of jobs and out of wages, and this chart
proves it.
Let me tell you, not only does it
cheat the people on the low end of the
scale, but it actually helps the people
on the higher end of the scale.
People like your children and your
grandchildren with a high school edu-
cation, people who are trying to get
their heads above water but they can’t
because they are drowned by a flood of
illegal aliens who work for practically
nothing, this primarily affects those on
the lower end of the income scale, as I
just showed you, who just can’t seem
to get ahead.
Friends, Democrats used to say they
are for the working man, and they love
to talk about income inequality. The
people on the high end have gone up;
the people on the low end haven’t.
Well, guess what? Here is why. Illegal
immigration plays a huge part in that.
So let’s stop complaining about in-
come inequality, and let’s actually
doing something about it. Let’s secure
our southern border, stop the flow of il-
legal immigrants who work for prac-
tically nothing and cheat the folks on
the low end of the scale out of jobs and
wages, and let’s watch wages rise.
It is not that hard to understand. It
is common sense. It is Economics 101.
The American middle class has suffered
for decades as a result of our uncom-
petitive economy, and illegal immigra-
tion is one of the primary reasons.
Now, let’s talk about what illegal im-
migration does to our social safety net.
In addition to drowning our middle
class, illegal immigration strains our
social safety net and costs taxpayers
billions of dollars.
These figures are from the Center for
Immigration Studies, and the chart
represents the percentage of immi-
grant-led households in blue and na-
tive-born households in red.
The percentage of immigrant house-
holds that get food aid in America is 45
percent; native-born households, 21 per-
cent. So illegal immigrants get twice
as much food aid as native-born citi-
zens.
Medicaid, 50 percent of illegal immi-
grants get some type of Medicaid ben-
efit; only 23 percent of native-born
Americans.
Cash benefits, when you include the
earned income tax credit, 31 percent of
illegal immigrants get some form of
cash subsidy from the United States
Government; only 10 percent of native-
born Americans.
If you take all that in total, 63 per-
cent of illegal immigrants get some
type of government benefit, as com-
pared to 35 percent of native-born
folks.
The last column represents the per-
centage of uninsured. Twenty-four per-
cent of the illegal immigrants have no
insurance as compared to 7.5 percent of
native-born households.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H599
January 15, 2019
When you think about people show-
ing up at the emergency room and hos-
pitals, and the government and tax-
payers having to cover the bill, 25 per-
cent of the illegal immigrant families
are one of the main sources of that
problem.
Last year, in my home county, Horry
County, South Carolina—now, Horry
County is a long way from the southern
border, over 1,500 miles. But there was
a claim brought against the school sys-
tem in Horry County, South Carolina,
by the U.S. Department of Justice. It
seems that the Department determined
that Horry County wasn’t doing
enough to accommodate students who
couldn’t speak English.
Well, you wouldn’t think that would
be that much of a problem in South
Carolina, being that we are such a long
way from the southern border. As it
turns out, 5,511 out of 44,700 students in
Horry County were English as a second
language. That is 13 percent of the stu-
dent body in Horry County, South
Carolina. So the school board agreed to
settle that claim by paying $600,000
more to provide more accommodation
for those students who couldn’t speak
English.
Let’s get off of illegal immigration
and talk about one of the other great
scourges that Americans endure as a
result of our failure to secure our
southern border.
In 2017, 72,000 Americans died from
drug overdoses. That is up 100 percent
in a decade. For most diseases and
sicknesses, the cures are getting better
and deaths are leveling off. It is the op-
posite for the drug scourge.
That 72,000 Americans who died in
2017—think about this, guys; listen to
this—is more than traffic deaths,
which was 37,000, and homicides at
17,000, combined. Traffic deaths and
homicides killed 54,000 Americans in
2017. Drug overdoses killed 72,000 peo-
ple. It is exploding.
Last year, there was a 38 percent in-
crease in meth, 22 percent increase in
heroin, and 73 percent increase in
fentanyl seized at our southern border,
and that is only what we seized. If that
is not a crisis, I don’t know what a cri-
sis is.
The DEA reports that 300 Americans
die every week from heroin, 90 percent
of which comes across our southern
border. Madam Speaker, 95 percent of
the cocaine comes across our southern
border, and much of the fentanyl comes
across our southern border.
The opioid epidemic is ravaging com-
munities across the country, including
my home State and district. In the
past 3 years, 2014 to 2017, the number of
opioid-involved overdose deaths in
South Carolina increased by 47 per-
cent—47 percent—from 508 to 748.
In 2017, 134 opioid deaths were in my
little congressional district that I rep-
resent, the Seventh District of South
Carolina. I asked Sheriff Thompson in
Horry County, and I asked Sheriff
Boone in Florence County, where these
drugs are coming from. They looked at
me and said 80-plus percent comes from
the southern border. That mirrors the
reports from the DEA.
As the President has stated, the sta-
tus quo response to the crisis at our
southern border is no longer effective.
NANCY PELOSI said a wall as a part of
the President’s border security plan is
amoral. I don’t think so. But 72,000
Americans dead last year, I know that
is amoral. 750 South Carolinians dead
last year primarily from drugs coming
across the southern border that we
refuse to control, I know that is amor-
al. 132 residents of my district dead
last year primarily from drugs coming
across our southern border, I know
that is amoral.
The scourge of drugs caused by our
failure to control our southern border
doesn’t just affect us. It affects our
southern neighbors as well.
Did you know there were more than
30,000 murders in Mexico last year?
That is almost twice as many murders
as we had, and they have a third of our
population, so their murder rate is six
times ours. Why is that?
Well, large portions of Mexico are
controlled by drug cartels. You see, our
failure to control our southern border
has given these people unimaginable
power and wealth. They outrank the
government in more than half of Mex-
ico, and they will fight to protect that
power and that wealth.
Madam Speaker, 30,000 murders, six
times the rate of murder in the United
States, and it is largely our fault, be-
cause we haven’t controlled our south-
ern border. When a gang comes knock-
ing on your door in Mexico or Guate-
mala and says they are going to take
your son and he is going to be a part of
their cartel, when they come and say,
hey, your daughter is looking good,
and they are going to grab her and sell
her into human trafficking, what are
you going to do? Are you going to sit
there and take it?
I can tell you what a lot of them are
doing. They are picking up everything
they have, and where are they heading?
They are heading to the southern bor-
der of the United States.
So the refugee crisis—think about
this—because we have failed to control
our southern border, because we have
enriched and emboldened these drug
cartels and drug lords, and we have al-
lowed them to take over governing
large parts of Central and South Amer-
ica, we have created the very refugee
crisis that is creating a crisis at our
southern border right now, because we
have failed to control the flow of drugs.
We have failed to stop these criminal
organizations.
The Democrats claim they are for
border security, but they refuse to take
any action or even participate in good-
faith negotiations. Just last week,
NANCY PELOSI offered $1 toward addi-
tional border security. Hillary Clinton,
CHUCK SCHUMER, and Barack Obama,
when they were Senators, all voted in
favor of funding a border wall in 2006.
Why are they against it now?
I will tell you why. It is their hatred
for President Trump stopping them
from doing what is best for their con-
stituents. They see this as a political
game, and they want to win, no matter
what the cost.
Let me tell you what the cost was
last year: 72,000 dead Americans, 750 in
South Carolina, 130 in my district, and
I promise you there were at least that
many in NANCY PELOSI’s district.
Democrats try to make this argu-
ment solely about a wall. President
Trump has repeatedly said we do not
need a wall for the entire length of the
2,000-mile border, but physical barriers
in selected areas are both effective and
necessary.
The Yuma border sector had the
highest number of illegal crossings in
the country before a barrier was built,
resulting in a 95 percent decrease in ap-
prehensions and a 91 percent decrease
in crime. San Diego, once ground zero
for illegal immigration, has seen a 92
percent decrease in apprehensions
since the fence was constructed.
The $5.7 billion passed by the House
Republicans in December would have
enhanced border security, not just a
wall. Any meaningful plan to deal with
illegal immigration must also require
employers to verify the employment
status of workers they hire and penal-
ize employers if they break the rules.
This system is called E-Verify, and it
is already in place. It is managed by
the Federal Government, but, amaz-
ingly, employers are not required to
participate. So in addition to border se-
curity, we have to have E-Verify.
It is time to stop the politics and se-
cure our border.
Democrats are terribly worried about
who gets blamed for the shutdown.
Frankly, I don’t care who gets the
blame. This is a fight, and it is a fight
to keep drugs off our streets and out of
the hands of our children. It is a fight
to keep our communities safe. It is a
fight for higher wages for hardworking
Americans, for more jobs, and for our
economy. And, friends, it is a fight
worth having.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

ACT OF 2019—Motion to Proceed
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
I move to proceed to S. 1.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the motion to pro-
ceed.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read as follows:
Motion to proceed to the consideration of
S. 1, a bill to make improvements to certain
defense and security assistance provisions
and to authorize the appropriation of funds
to Israel, to reauthorize the United States-
Jordan Defense Cooperation Act of 2015, and
to halt the wholesale slaughter of the Syrian
people, and for other purposes.
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
over the course of this partial govern-
ment shutdown, we have seen our
Democratic colleagues engage in in-
creasingly acrobatic contortions in
order to dodge a serious conversation
about the urgent humanitarian and se-
curity crisis down at our southern bor-
der. Their refusal to come to the nego-
tiating table has serious implications
for the hundreds of thousands of Fed-
eral workers going without pay and for
all Americans who deserve a nation
that can secure its own border.
Along the way, we have heard that
new funding of any sort—any sort—of
border barrier, even the kinds that
Democrats have supported so recently
and so often, would now be an immo-
rality. An immorality?
We have heard serious proposals
brushed aside with joking offers of $1
to address the critical issue. We have
even heard frank admissions that, 30
days from now, there would be no
progress toward an agreement on bor-
der security, even if the government
were reopened.
Under normal circumstances, we
could expect lines like these from the
furthest left organizers and most vocal
liberal protesters. But these are not
normal circumstances. These are the
words, believe it or not, of the Speaker
of the House, the gentlelady from Cali-
fornia, NANCY PELOSI.
It is unclear exactly when the Speak-
er made the determination that the ex-
plicit requests of the men and women
who secure our borders and the safety
of our communities would take a back-
seat to the political whims of the far
left, that the border efforts toward
which Democrats have agreed to direct
billions of dollars in the past have
transformed overnight into something
evil. But here we are, day 25. We know
the new and unreasonable position of
the Speaker of the House.
So here, in the Senate, my Demo-
cratic colleagues have an important
choice to make. They could stand with
common sense, with border experts,
with Federal workers—and with their
own past voting records, by the way—
or they could continue to remain pas-
sive spectators, complaining from the
sidelines as the Speaker refuses to ne-
gotiate with the White House and en-
sures that our Nation keeps going
round and round and round this polit-
ical carousel. It is up to our colleagues
on the other side of the aisle.
BORDER SECURITY
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, the substance of the border secu-
rity issue is not the only subject that
is occasioning a spectacular display of
inconsistency from my colleagues
across the aisle.
If you recall, since last week, the ap-
parent position of Senate Democrats
has been that the Senate itself cannot
engage in any of the people’s business
until government funding is resolved.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S188 January 15, 2019
Democrats have held this position so
dogmatically that three times now
they have voted against advancing a
bipartisan and urgently needed pack-
age of legislation that concerns Israel,
Jordan, and the civil war in Syria.
It has been the Democrats’ very own
‘‘Senate shutdown’’ on top of the par-
tial government shutdown they are
prolonging. What about our ally Israel?
What about the innocent people of
Syria? I guess they are just out of
luck—just out of luck. The Democratic
leader has made clear that they will
just have to wait. They will just have
to wait until he decides to end his fili-
buster of these bipartisan bills, which,
until last week, by the way, he sup-
ported. It is a bizarre position—a truly
bizarre position.
It has directly contradicted the stat-
ed foreign policy views of many of our
Democratic colleagues, but this has
been the Democratic leader’s position:
Filibuster the expanded assistance for
Israel. Filibuster the new consequences
for giving aid and comfort to the Assad
regime as it butchers its own people.
That is what the Democratic caucus
has overwhelmingly voted to do on
three occasions.
But now, we are informed that it was
all just a farce. The Democratic leader
actually doesn’t mind doing other busi-
ness because he now intends to bring a
privileged and political stunt of a mo-
tion relating to the administration’s
use of sanctions against Russia.
So now at least we know the score.
Our Democratic colleagues don’t really
object to Senate action as such; they
just object to debating a bipartisan
package of bills to reinforce our sup-
port for Israel, help Jordan stand firm
amidst regional chaos, and take action
to hold accountable those who have
tortured and murdered countless—
countless—Syrian civilians.
There is no reason this bill shouldn’t
sail through Congress and be signed by
the President. A bipartisan bill to sup-
port Israel, defend Jordan, and provide
justice for innocent Syria—that is
what the Democratic leader is filibus-
tering. But a partisan motion on an un-
related foreign policy issue? Oh, he is
perfectly happy to see it come right
here to the floor for a vote. As I said,
at least we know the score.
So here is my commitment to Israel
and to Jordan and to the Syrian peo-
ple: I will continue to force these cyn-
ical tactics into the light of day.
Democrats may vote a fourth time—or
a fifth time—to filibuster these bipar-
tisan bills, even as they turn the Sen-
ate toward other business. But Repub-
licans will not abandon the need for
American leadership in the world.
NOMINATION OF WILLIAM BARR
Madam President, on one final mat-
ter, today our colleagues on the Judici-
ary Committee will begin nomination
hearings for Mr. William Barr, the dis-
tinguished public servant President
Trump has asked to serve as the Na-
tion’s next Attorney General.
Certainly, no one needs me to explain
all of the reasons this is a vital posi-
tion. The Department of Justice is
charged with duties such as protecting
Americans’ civil rights, defending the
public order to which citizens are enti-
tled, and upholding the time-honored
tradition that the United States of
America is a nation governed by law.
So it is the Nation’s good fortune—our
good fortune—that the President has
selected such a completely qualified
and thoroughly prepared leader to fill
this vacancy.
First and foremost, of course, is the
fact that Bill Barr has served in this
position before. As Attorney General
under President Bush 41 in the early
1990s, he fulfilled his oath and led the
Department of Justice with honor and
with skill. He was widely regarded as a
capable administrator and as a strong,
independent, and principled advocate
for fairness and for following the law.
His tenure confirmed the great con-
fidence that Republican and Demo-
cratic Senators had all placed in him
when they confirmed him to that posi-
tion unanimously. Democrats con-
trolled the Senate in 1991—Democrats
controlled the Senate in 1991. That is
when he was confirmed—confirmed on
a voice vote. Boy, those were the good
old days.
Amid the proceedings, our distin-
guished colleague Senator LEAHY ex-
pressed confidence that Mr. Barr would
be ‘‘an independent voice for all Ameri-
cans.’’
Then-Senator Joe Biden, who was
then the chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, put it this way at the
time: He is ‘‘a heck of an honorable
guy.’’
So 28 years ago, leading Democrats
were practically heading up the Bill
Barr fan club, and his subsequent serv-
ice proved they had made the right
call. In fact, this nominee has been
unanimously confirmed by the Senate
three times—three times.
Before serving as Attorney General,
he worked as an Assistant Attorney
General and a Deputy Attorney Gen-
eral. In no case did even a single Sen-
ator identify a good reason to oppose
his confirmation—three times unani-
mously.
So it is beyond safe to say that Mr.
Barr is eminently qualified and widely
respected. I look forward to his testi-
mony today and to the testimony of
those who know him and his work. I
hope every Senator will afford Mr. Barr
the fair consideration he so obviously
deserves.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader is recognized.
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, as
the Trump shutdown drags on, more
and more Americans are getting hurt.
Public servants have been working
without pay, critical Agencies are un-
able to perform the functions they are
supposed to perform for the American
people—whether that is inspecting food
supply, protecting our airports and
prisons, or helping farmers and small
businesses get loans. We are now ap-
proaching tax season with the IRS
under severe limitations.
When will the President’s ridiculous
manufactured crisis come to an end?
I have three words for President
Trump, Leader MCCONNELL, and our
Republican Senators: Open the govern-
ment.
We can debate border security. We
have debated it for a month and a half.
We haven’t come to a conclusion. Open
the government, and we can debate
border security while the government
is open.
Now, for weeks, as I said, we have
been at a standstill. We have offered
the President several ways to uncouple
his demand for a border wall from a
government shutdown. The President
has been obstinate, insisting on a $5.7
billion wall he promised that Mexico
would pay for.
The few times that his deputies—the
Vice President and the Chief of Staff—
have made proposals to Democrats, the
President contradicted them soon
thereafter. Just yesterday, the Presi-
dent flatly refused to consider a pro-
posal from his close ally in the Senate,
Senator GRAHAM, to open the govern-
ment temporarily while we debate bor-
der security.
Sadly, neither Republicans in Con-
gress nor the President’s own staff
seem willing to tell him what everyone
else already knows: The President does
not have the votes in either House of
Congress for his expensive, ineffective
wall.
The reason we have been unable to
make any progress is that President
Trump is not yet interested in making
progress.
So there is only one person who can
help America break through this grid-
lock: Leader MITCH MCCONNELL. For
the past month, Leader MCCONNELL has
been content to hide behind the Presi-
dent, essentially giving him a veto over
what comes to the floor of the Senate.
It has put him in the ridiculous posi-
tion of refusing to consider legislation
to reopen the government that nearly
every Senate Republican has voted
for—legislation that leader MCCONNELL
has proudly voted for; legislation that
the American people favor by a 2-to-1
margin, including nearly 40 percent of
Republicans.
The American people suffering the
dire consequences of this shutdown can
no longer afford to wait for the Presi-
dent to come around. The President
must be shown the will of the Congress,
and I believe that if Leader MCCONNELL
were to put the House-passed bills on

the floor, they would receive a signifi-
cant majority in the Senate, a veto-
proof majority.
So I would appeal to Leader MCCON-
NELL: Do what is right for the country.
Do what is right for hundreds of thou-
sands of Federal employees laboring
without pay. Do what is right for our
farmers and small businesses, home-
owners, and taxpayers. Do what is
right for America.
President Trump may not care about
the harm he is doing to all of these
people, but our Republican Senators,
including Leader MCCONNELL, should.
A few years ago, Leader MCCONNELL
remarked: Remember me? I am the guy
that gets us out of shutdowns.
Well, Leader MCCONNELL, now is the
time. Leader MCCONNELL, allow a vote
on legislation and reopen the govern-
ment.
In a short time, a few of my Demo-
cratic colleagues will ask the Senate
for that chance. Will Leader MCCON-
NELL help us reopen the government?
Will some of our Republican Senators
actually join us, not in nice words but
in actually voting to reopen the gov-
ernment? Or will Leader MCCONNELL
block it yet again, aiding and abetting
President Trump’s desire to extend his
government shutdown?
One final point here, President
Trump thinks if he holds out long
enough, he will win the fight with the
American people. Every day he is los-
ing. The Gallup poll today had him at
a near-record low of 37 percent popu-
larity. Even some of his base is losing
face.
President Trump, you are not going
to win this fight with the American
people. Every day it drags on, you are
less popular. Every day it drags on,
people blame you and the Republicans,
not the Democrats. You are not win-
ning the fight. You may be in your own
untruth bubble, but you are not win-
ning the fight. Everyone knows that.
We certainly do.
NOMINATION OF WILLIAM BARR
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, as we speak, the Senate Judiciary
Committee is conducting its hearing on
the nomination of William Barr to be
the next Attorney General of the
United States. It is an august position
that demands the highest degree of
credibility, transparency, and fidelity
to rule of law, even during a normal
Presidency.
But given President Trump’s actions,
his disdain for rule of law, his derision
of the rulings of an independent judici-
ary, his public contempt for law en-
forcement procedures of the Justice
Department, the burden of proof for
William Barr is higher than it would be
for other Presidents.
This is not a normal Presidency. We
don’t need an Attorney General who
will just comply with this President.
That is a danger to the Republic.
The Senate should expect unequivo-
cal and explicit commitments from Mr.
Barr to resist President Trump. Mr.
Barr cannot merely give perfunctory,
boilerplate assurances. Saying ‘‘I am
for transparency’’ is not good enough.
Will he release Mueller’s report—yes
or no? If he can’t answer ‘‘yes,’’ he
doesn’t deserve the position. Will he
not interfere in any way with Mueller’s
investigation as opposed to saying he
likes Mueller and thinks he is doing a
good job? If Mr. Barr can’t say ‘‘yes,’’
that he will not interfere in any way
with the Mueller investigation, he
doesn’t deserve the job, particularly in
light of his writings.
We should expect unequivocal com-
mitments from Barr to defend the in-
tegrity of the FBI and our Federal law
enforcement officers, not vague state-
ments that give him plenty of wiggle
room to do President Trump’s dirty
work if he gets to be Attorney General,
and we should expect an unequivocal
commitment from Mr. Barr to allow
the special investigation to proceed
and conclude without any—underline
‘‘any’’—interference.
One last point, the expectations for
Mr. Barr are even more demanding
given the recent revelation that he
wrote a detailed, unsolicited memo to
the Justice Department criticizing the
Mueller investigation, despite having
no knowledge of its workings. The
memo revealed that Barr holds an as-
tonishingly broad—almost imperial—
view of executive power. That should
also be a serious line of inquiry for our
colleagues on the Judiciary Com-
mittee.
The next Attorney General will take
charge of a Justice Department that
has been embroiled in near-constant
chaos for 2 years at a critical moment
for our democracy. The Senate should
only approve an Attorney General of
unimpeachable integrity and unim-
peachable fidelity to the rule of law,
with the strength and conviction to re-
sist the worst impulses of this Presi-
dent, who, probably, when it comes to
the Justice Department, has the worst
impulses of any President we have ever
had.
RUSSIAN SANCTIONS
Madam President, finally, on Russia
sanctions, later this afternoon the Sen-
ate will move to consider a motion to
proceed to a resolution of disapproval
on the Treasury Department’s proposal
to relax sanctions on three companies
owned and controlled by sanctioned
Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. The
case against the Treasury Depart-
ment’s proposal is strong. It fails to
sufficiently limit Deripaska’s stake in
the three companies. It merely reduces
his ownership to 45 percent. Many U.S.
companies are heavily influenced by an
owner who controls much less than a
45-percent share. Why didn’t they re-
duce it to 10 or 15? But they didn’t.
Treasury’s plan also allows for Rus-
sian shareholders with family and busi-
ness ties to Deripaska to retain share-
holder interest. Considering that
Deripaska’s ex-wife and father-in-law
control 7 percent of the company, add
that to the 45, and he has total control.
So Treasury does not come close to
going far enough.
Beyond the weak terms of the deal,
the Senate must consider that
Deripaska has deep ties to President
Putin and his intelligence apparatus,
organized crime, and Mr. Paul
Manafort, a subject of the special coun-
sel’s investigation.
It is deeply suspect that the Trump
administration would propose sanc-
tions relief for Deripaska’s companies
before the special counsel finished his
work. We should not allow any sanc-
tion relief for President Putin’s trusted
agents or the companies they control
before the conclusion of the investiga-
tion.
Finally—and maybe most seriously
of all—there is a foreign policy issue
here at stake. President Putin’s gov-
ernment, one of Russia’s largest banks,
and the Russian economy have a direct
interest in sanction relief for
Deripaska’s companies. Why is the
Trump administration proposing sanc-
tions relief when President Putin has
not yet made any move to curtail or
constrain his maligned activities
around the globe?
Now, this morning, my friend from
Kentucky called this a political stunt
and a farce. That is appalling. After all
Putin has done, this is a stunt and a
farce? And why are we doing it now?
He said: Why are Democrats doing it?
Because the underlying law that al-
lows for this resolution has a 30-day
alarm clock on it. The alarm clock
goes off Thursday. Democrats are not
forcing this vote; the law is.
I would say to the leader, Democrats
were not the ones who decided to relax
sanctions on Putin’s cronies just before
the Christmas holiday, hoping no one
would notice. That was the Trump ad-
ministration. If Leader MCCONNELL
wants to know why we are voting on
Russian sanctions this afternoon, he
should go talk to the White House.
So allow me to appeal directly to my
Republican colleagues. Whatever your
view on this issue, there are enough
questions—enough questions—that we
should vote for the motion to proceed
so that you can hear the debate. It is
an important debate. Putin is laughing
with the damage he is doing to Amer-
ica. We cannot go along.
In the past, one of the finer moments
of this Senate, which Leader MCCON-
NELL talks about all the time, was
when we joined in a bipartisan way to
impose sanctions on Russia. Well, we
should not relax that view. We should
not relax that vigilance. The details
here are complex. The Senate and the
American people ought to have a real
understanding of the facts before vot-
ing. If that debate is allowed to pro-
ceed, I believe my Senate colleagues
will see the wisdom of keeping the cur-
rent sanctions in place.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

S190 January 15, 2019
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. THUNE. Madam President,
Democrats continue to talk about the
need to fully reopen the government,
and I cannot agree with them more. It
is time to end this partial shutdown
and get the government fully operating
again. But there is a problem. Demo-
crats may talk a lot about the need to
reopen the government, but they are
not willing to do the work that would
be required to actually get the govern-
ment open.
In a divided government, negotiation
and compromise are essential. If you
want to get something done in a di-
vided government, you have to com-
promise. But that doesn’t seem to be
something the Democrats understand.
For Democrats, it is ‘‘my way or the
highway.’’ They won’t give an inch.
They want their way, and they want
their way only. All of us would like to
get our proposals passed exactly as we
want them, with no changes, but we all
know that is unrealistic. If you want to
get something done, you usually have
to compromise.
The White House has a strongly held
position but has also made it very clear
that it is willing to be flexible and ne-
gotiate with Democrats, but the Demo-
crats refuse to play ball, and they con-
tinue to hold parts of the Federal Gov-
ernment hostage.
We just heard our colleague from
New York, the Democratic leader, sug-
gest that it should be Republican lead-
er Senator MCCONNELL’s job to solve
this problem, but the fact is—and we
all know this—the negotiation in this
circumstance has to be between the
President of the United States and the
Democrats in the Senate and the House
who have refused to budge on that posi-
tion.
The Republican leader has made it
very clear that as soon as the Presi-
dent is willing to sign something and
the Democrats here are willing to
produce enough votes to give us the 60
votes that are necessary to pass it in
the Senate and the House, he will move
a bill through the Senate that we can
get to the President and end this shut-
down, get the government open again,
and fund border security, which is an
important priority for our country and
for our national security interests.
That is a position which, until re-
cently, was also held by the Demo-
crats. As recently as December, the
Democratic leader indicated that to
solve this budget stalemate, this im-
passe we seem to be having, we needed
to have the support of the leaders in
both the House and the Senate and the
President before either Chamber should
vote on legislation. He suggested that
the President needed to come out pub-
licly in support of it—in other words,
to indicate he would sign any legisla-
tion that might move.
So that is where we are. It is not a
function of the Republican leader’s.
The Republican leader is prepared to
produce the votes that are necessary to
pass legislation to reopen the govern-
ment. It is entirely dependent upon the
President of the United States, who
must sign that bill into law, and the
Democrats here in the Senate, who
have to produce the requisite number
of Democrats to get the 60 votes that
are required to pass it in the Senate.
That is where we are.
Frankly, right now, there isn’t a ne-
gotiation going on. The Democrats’ re-
fusal to negotiate is victimizing the
very workers they want to protect. The
Federal workers who are struggling
right now are struggling precisely be-
cause Democrats are refusing to work
with this President, and that has a lot
more to do with politics than it has to
do with the issue itself.
Democrats need to negotiate with
the White House to reopen the govern-
ment, but they should also want to
work with the White House on border
security solutions. Border security is a
national security imperative. No coun-
try can be secure if dangerous individ-
uals can creep across its borders un-
checked and unobserved, and Demo-
crats used to understand this.
In 2006, the Democratic leader and
the ranking member of the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee voted for legisla-
tion to authorize a border fence. They
were joined in their vote by then-Sen-
ator Biden, then-Senator Clinton, and
then-Senator Obama.
In 2013, every Senate Democrat—
every Senate Democrat—supported leg-
islation requiring the completion of a
700-mile fence along our southern bor-
der. This legislation would have pro-
vided $46 billion for border security and
$8 billion specifically for a physical
barrier.
As recently as last year, nearly every
Senate Democrat supported $25 billion
in border security.
My point is that the Democrats in
the Senate have in the past recognized
the importance, No. 1, of securing the
border and, No. 2, how important a
physical barrier is as a part of the solu-
tion to securing our border—not en-
tirely dependent upon a border wall but
certainly a part of that solution, to in-
clude technological solutions, man-
power, additional personnel, cameras,
censors, all the modern technology
that we have, but in certain places rec-
ognizing that the fence works. The
fence has worked. There is already 700
miles of fence on the southern border.
I would point out that in 2009, the
Senate Democratic leader said in a
speech that ‘‘any immigration solution
must recognize that we must do as
much as we can to gain control of our
borders as soon as possible.’’ That was
in 2009 from the Senate Democratic
leader. He went on to discuss, interest-
ingly enough, progress that had been
made on border security between 2005
and 2009, including ‘‘construction of 630
miles of border fence that create a sig-
nificant barrier to illegal immigration
on our southern land border.’’ That
from the Democratic leader in 2009,
again crediting the construction of 630
miles of border fence that creates a sig-
nificant barrier to illegal immigration
on our southern land border. In other
words, in 2009, the Democratic leader
not only didn’t oppose border fences, he
praised them.
The fact is, our border is not secure.
Tens of thousands of individuals try to
cross our southern border illegally
each month. Illegal drugs flow into this
country through ports of entry and
other unsecured areas of the border.
Federal agents have seen a 115-percent
increase in the amount of fentanyl
seized between ports of entry, and 90
percent of the heroin supply in this
country flows across our southern bor-
der. There is human trafficking, weap-
ons trafficking, and more.
We need better border security, in-
cluding more barriers, technology, and
personnel along our southern border.
We don’t know who is coming into our
country and why. We need to ensure
that we keep criminals, traffickers,
terrorists, and dangerous goods out of
this country.
House majority leader STENY HOYER
was asked about the Democrats’ flip-
flop on border security and whether
there is any real difference between
what they supported in the past and
what they are opposing now. He said:
‘‘I don’t have an answer that I think is
a really good answer.’’
‘‘I don’t have an answer that I think
is a really good answer.’’ Well, Madam
President, at least that is honest.
Democrats don’t have a good answer
because there is no real difference be-
tween what they have supported in the
past and what they are opposing right
now.
Before Christmas, I came to the floor
to talk about the divided government
we would be dealing with in 2019 and
2020. I noted that divided government
doesn’t have to spell the doom of pro-
ductivity. In fact, over the past 30-plus
years, some of our greatest legislative
achievements have been the product of
divided government. But I also noted
that in order for us to be productive in
the 116th Congress, Democrats would
have to decide to work with us. So far,
they have decided not to.
In addition to refusing to negotiate
on border security, Senate Democrats
have also blocked the Senate from con-
sidering legislation to support Israel’s
security, strengthen our relationship
with our Jordanian allies, and hold ac-
countable individuals who participate
in the atrocities of the Assad regime in
Syria.
Despite our divided government, we
can still accomplish important things
for the American people, but it is going
to require an about-face from Demo-
crats, who have so far made the 116th
Congress about partisanship and their
hostility to this President.
It is time for Democrats to stop talk-
ing about reopening the government
and to take steps that would actually
do so by committing to real negotia-
tions with the White House. Then and

only then can we get past this impasse,
get the government open and func-
tioning, and address what is a critical
and important national security imper-
ative for our country, and that is en-
suring that our southern border is se-
cure.
It is not about Republicans in the
Senate. It is about the President of the
United States, for whom this is a huge
priority, something he is passionate
about doing and a commitment he
made to the American people. And it is
about the Democrats here in the Sen-
ate—and in the House but here in the
Senate, where it takes 60 votes to pass
anything—sitting down across the
table from the President in good faith
and dealing with what usually happens
in circumstances like this, and that is
to negotiate an agreement for both
sides, give a little bit, have a little
give-and-take.
As I mentioned, the President has
been very flexible and very open to sit-
ting down with Democrats. In the dis-
cussions I have been a part of, he has
demonstrated his willingness to com-
promise. But I have yet to see a single
step by the Democrats here in the Sen-
ate or in the House, in their leadership,
a single move, a single inch of move-
ment in the direction of trying to solve
this problem. Instead, they seem bent
on turning it into a political issue.
That is not good for the American peo-
ple. It is certainly not good for those
employees who are struggling out there
because they are not being paid and
certainly not good for the crisis we
face at our southern border and the se-
curity threat that poses for the Amer-
ican people.
I hope we will do better. We can do
better, but it is going to require nego-
tiation. It is going to require a willing-
ness to sit down at the table in good
faith and to get discussions going
about how we solve this important
problem.
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 21
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am
here with my colleague Senator VAN
HOLLEN. The two of us are going to
make a unanimous consent request to
reopen the government.
I know the distinguished majority
leader is here. We are on day 25 of this
tragic, outrageous, needless, and dan-
gerous partial shutdown. Senator VAN
HOLLEN and I have met with govern-
ment workers, and we heard their ac-
count. They can’t pay their bills. Mort-
gages are going without payment. I
heard yesterday from a Federal worker
who can’t pay their children’s extra ac-
tivities at school for dance lessons.
They can’t help their relatives deal
with their problems. They are post-
poning needed health treatment issues.
I read last week on the floor of this
body a letter from Kristen Jones and
Brad Starkey, air traffic controllers
who explained how they can’t take care
of their family needs. So 800,000 people
are furloughed without pay or working
without pay—30 percent are veterans.
Small businesses are shuttering their
operations because they depend upon
government workers for their business.
From cleaners to restaurants, they are
finding they don’t have the business
they used to have.
Kevin Hassett, Chairman of the
White House Council of Economic Ad-
visers, indicates the economic impact
is $1.2 billion a week on our economy.
We heard that small businesses have
to lay off employees because they are
not getting their Federal partnerships.
I used the example of the Senior Serv-
ices of America. They laid off 176 em-
ployees because the USDA and Forest
Service can’t honor their contracts.
People can’t close on their home mort-
gages because they don’t have pay
stubs to show their income. The FHA
can’t certify loans with HUD being
shuttered. Core missions are being
compromised.
I talked to air traffic controllers yes-
terday—people in air safety. They
don’t have their full complement. They
are professionals. We have the most
professional government workforce in
the world, and they are dedicated pro-
fessionals who do their job, but we are
asking them to do it with half the
number of employees and without get-
ting a paycheck. That is outrageous.
This shutdown has to end. The Presi-
dent wants it. We are an independent
body. We are a coequal branch of gov-
ernment. We could open up the govern-
ment. Yes, we can negotiate border se-
curity, but we have to have the govern-
ment open. You can’t negotiate under
circumstances where the President is
holding the country hostage, and he
undermines his own negotiators. It
cries out for Congress to take the lead.
I agree with Senator GRAHAM when
he says we should open the government
and then let us negotiate using the reg-
ular process of Congress to debate the
issues of border security, including im-
migration issues. We are a coequal
branch of government. Two bills are on
our desk. Both have passed the House
of Representatives.
I am going to make a unanimous con-
sent request with regard to H.R. 21, and
my colleague Senator VAN HOLLEN will
deal with the rest of the government.
H.R. 21 has six appropriations bills that
are not related to the issue of border
security. They have already been acted
upon by this body. They are not part of
this dispute. It is Financial Services
and General Government. It is Agri-
culture. It is Interior and Environ-
ment. It is Transportation and HUD. It
is State and Foreign Operations. It is
Commerce, Justice, and Science. They
passed this body either by a 92-to-6
vote for the Appropriations Committee
or unanimous or near unanimous by
our Appropriations Committee under
Republican leadership in a bipartisan
manner. We need to reopen the govern-
ment.
Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the Senate proceed
to the immediate consideration of Cal-
endar No. 5, H.R. 21, making appropria-
tions for the fiscal year ending Sep-
tember 30, 2019; I further ask that the
bill be considered read a third time and
passed and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon
the table with no intervening action or
debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Mr. MCCONNELL. I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I say in
response to the distinguished majority
leader, I just don’t understand why the
Senate is missing in action. We are a
coequal branch of government. Let us
speak about opening the government.
There are Members on both sides who
understand that we can debate border
security, and we can reach agreements,
but you can’t do that with a partial
government shutdown.
This is President Trump’s shutdown,
and now with the majority leader’s ob-
jections, the Republicans in the Senate
are assisting this shutdown.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Let me repeat
again what I have said now for some 3
weeks. The solution to this is a nego-
tiation between the one person in the
country who can sign something into
law, the President of the United
States, and our Democratic colleagues.
For the Senate Republicans to partici-
pate in something that doesn’t lead to
an outcome strikes me as not what the
Senate ought to be involved in.
We have an important package of
bills that have been held up during the
Senate shutdown—never mind the gov-
ernment shutdown—related to our col-
leagues, our friends in the Middle East,
the Israelis, related to the Syrian civil
war and all the atrocities that have oc-
curred. There is business to be done in
the Senate.
The way to solve the government
shutdown is for the administration and
our good friends in the House in the
majority and Senate Democrats to
reach a legislative solution. When that
happens, I will be more than happy to
call it up because we know it will actu-
ally solve the problem.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. CARDIN. Briefly, in response to
the majority leader, the first priority
should be reopen government. That
needs to be our very first priority of
business.
In regard to the legislation the leader
is referring to, let me point out that
those bills could have been passed in

the last Congress where Republicans
controlled both the House and the Sen-
ate. The majority leader made a deci-
sion on floor time that it was not a pri-
ority to be considered in the 115th Con-
gress.
Let me also say, in regard to Israel,
it will benefit from the foreign ops ap-
propriations bill to be passed, which is
part of my unanimous consent request
of an additional $200 million, but that
is being held up because of this shut-
down that has been caused by the
President and has now been assisted by
the Republicans in the Senate.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.J. RES. 1
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President,
the issue here is that, under the U.S.
Constitution, the Senate really does
need to do its job as a separate and co-
equal branch of government.
Last week, Senator CARDIN and I
were right where we are today—here on
the floor of the Senate, asking consent
that the Senate immediately take up
and vote on the two House bills that
are on the Senate calendar as we speak
and pass them and send them to the
President to reopen the government.
Last week, the majority leader blocked
a vote on that. He blocked consent to
take up those bills to reopen the gov-
ernment. Since last week, much has
changed, and much has stayed the
same. Here is what has changed.
The impact and harm of the shut-
down is growing by the day. It is me-
tastasizing around the country. Here
are some headlines: ‘‘The cascade of
shutdown problems grows each week.’’
Another headline: ‘‘This is ridiculous:
Small-business owners can’t get loans
as shutdown enters Day 20.’’ That was
day 20. We are now on day 25. ‘‘FBI op-
erations damaged as shutdown con-
tinues.’’ ‘‘FBI Agents Group Says Shut-
down Affects Law Enforcement.’’ They
point out it is putting those on the job
at greater risk because those are who
are furloughed who support them can’t
give them the backup they need.
The FDA continues to not do its rou-
tine food inspections, and American
veterans—and veterans make up 30 per-
cent of the Federal workforce—are
being disproportionately hurt by the
shutdown.
We just heard it reported that the
White House economists are doubling
their estimate of the harm being done
to our economy each week. It is al-
ready in the billions of dollars, and
they are saying it looks as though it
will be twice that much as this thing
grows exponentially.
Services have been shut down for the
American people. There were 800,000
Federal employees, as of last Friday,
who received pay stubs like the one I
am holding in my hand. This is one
that was for an air traffic controller.
Starting last Friday, 800,000 Federal
employees did not get paychecks. Hun-
dreds of thousands of them are on the
job, working, and hundreds of thou-
sands of them have been locked out of
work. What they tell us is they just
want to get back to work and do their
jobs for the American people. If you
look at this pay stub, at the net pay, it
reads ‘‘zero’’—a big, fat goose egg. I
can tell you these Federal employees
are getting bills. They are getting their
mortgage and rent bills. They don’t say
zero. They stay the same. So here you
have 800,000 Federal employees who are
unable to make do—missing mortgage
payments, missing rent payments,
missing their monthly installments on
community college payments. On top
of that, you have all of these small
businesses that do work for the Federal
Government that are beginning to go
belly-up, and their employees are being
told not to go in to work.
Since Senator CARDIN and I were here
on the floor just last week, things have
gotten much worse around the country,
but here is what has stayed the same—
that we have it in our power today to
take up two House bills to open the
government.
I was listening to the majority leader
say: Well, you know, the President
says he is not going to sign them.
Yet we are a separate branch of gov-
ernment. We are the article I branch of
government. I am holding in my hand,
right here, the bill that Senator
CARDIN asked us to vote on today. I
think the public needs to know what is
in it because what is in it has already
been supported on a bipartisan basis by
this U.S. Senate.
It has provisions to open about five
Departments of the U.S. Government
that have nothing to do with Homeland
Security. We passed that by a vote of
92 to 6. The President says that he
doesn’t want to sign it. He can veto it.
With 92 to 6, it is a veto override—big
time. Also contained in here are bills
that passed the Senate Appropriations
Committee by a vote of 30 to nothing
and 30 to 1. That is what is in here—bi-
partisan bills.
So the question for this body, as a
separate branch of government, is this:
Why in the world are we not going to
allow a vote to reopen the government
on provisions that we have already
agreed to on an overwhelming bipar-
tisan basis—in fact, with a veto-proof
margin?
The President can say that he is not
going to sign it. That is his business.
That is the executive branch. For good-
ness’ sake, let’s do our job here in the
U.S. Senate, because every day that
goes by with this growing harm, the
Senate is more and more complicit,
and we are an accomplice to the shut-
down.
I know President Trump likes to talk
about the fact that he has done things
that no other President has done before
in the history of the United States.
This time, he is right. He has the long-
est shutdown of any President in the
United States. He said he would be
proud to shut down the government if
he didn’t get his way. I know that no
Senator here—Republican or Demo-
cratic—is proud to shut down the gov-
ernment, certainly, for the longest pe-
riod in history.
So let’s do the right thing. Let’s do
our job. Let’s not just say the Presi-
dent is the only one who can handle
this. We can handle it.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of Calendar No.
6, H.J. Res. 1, making further con-
tinuing appropriations for the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security. I further
ask that the joint resolution be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table
with no intervening action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
an objection?
Mr. MCCONNELL. I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I suggest
the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to

unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.

dered.

RUSSIA SANCTIONS
Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I
rise today to express my support for
S.J. Res. 2, a resolution of disapproval
on lifting sanctions against the energy
and aluminum companies En+, RUSAL,
and EuroSibEnergo.
To start from the beginning, the
United States of America has had very
good reasons for sanctioning Oleg
Deripaska. There are a number of sig-
nificant national security risks at
play. That is why repeatedly—not just
in the current administration but in
prior administrations—this individual
has been denied a visa and why he has
been personally sanctioned by the
Treasury Department. As a matter of
fact, the Treasury press release an-
nouncing the sanctions noted that
Deripaska ‘‘has been investigated for
money laundering, has been accused of
threatening the lives of business rivals,
illegally wiretapping a government of-
ficial, and taking part in extortion and
racketeering.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S193
January 15, 2019
These are not the qualifications of
someone who should get relief from the
United States. I appreciate the fact
that his company, RUSAL, has an
enormous effect upon the aluminum
markets. I appreciate the efforts the
Treasury Department has tried to
make in restricting his control. But
any businessperson knows that if you
take an ownership position from 70 per-
cent to 45 percent, and even with the
voting power of 35 percent, you still
control a company, particularly when
this company was founded and the
management team was all created by
Mr. Deripaska.
As we see continuing challenges com-
ing out of the Russian Government, as
we see continued efforts of Mr.
Deripaska, being one of Vladimir
Putin’s closest allies and closest cro-
nies, we would send absolutely the
wrong signal if we in this body were to
remove these sanctions.
I know my friend the Senator from
Texas wants to speak in a moment. I
simply want to refer to the chairman
of the Intelligence Committee, Chair-
man BURR, who has frequently pointed
out that Deripaska and his associates
have come up a number of times in our
Senate Intelligence Committee’s Rus-
sia investigation. All those facts can’t
be laid out here right now, but I
strongly urge my colleagues to vote in
favor of this resolution that will come
up later today, that we don’t send a
signal that we are open for business
with individuals who have the reputa-
tion of Oleg Deripaska, and that we
maintain the sanctions on both him
and his company, RUSAL.
I yield the floor to my friend the Sen-
ator from Texas.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I
would say to my friend from Virginia,
we both serve on the Senate Intel-
ligence Committee, and of course we
have both been intimately involved in
the investigation on Russia’s activities
up to and including the 2016 election.
I would like to point out the hypoc-
risy of our colleagues across the aisle
who refused to take up any legislation
whatsoever, such as S. 1, which is on
the floor and which would take ex-
traordinarily positive measures to pro-
tect our most important allies in the
Middle East, including Israel and Jor-
dan. They filibustered that bill and
said: We are not going to take up any
legislation until the government is
back open—100 percent of it.
For the past 2 weeks, the minority
leader has paralyzed the work of the
Senate, saying they would block the
Senate from considering any legisla-
tion unrelated to government funding.
A number of our colleagues have said—
for example, the junior Senator from
Virginia said: ‘‘The Senate should vote
on nothing else until we vote to reopen
the government. Period.’’ Senator
MERKLEY said: ‘‘The Senate’s schedule
cannot be business as usual if we shut
down a quarter of the government and
just leave it shut down.’’ Senator
BOOKER said that Senate Democrats
should block consideration of all unre-
lated bills.
All this comes as a result of the fact
that the impetus is on the Democrats
to come forward and negotiate a reso-
lution of the shutdown in good faith.
But to this point, the Speaker, Ms.
PELOSI, and the minority leader, Sen-
ator SCHUMER, have simply refused to
negotiate with the President.
I was with the President down in
Texas, down along the border, on
Thursday. He is willing to negotiate.
We know we had broad bipartisan sup-
port for the Secure Fence Act, for ex-
ample, in 2006, authorizing up to 800
miles of fencing on the southern bor-
der. The Democratic leader voted for
that, and so did Barack Obama and Hil-
lary Clinton. Later, in 2014, all Demo-
crats voted for $40 billion in border se-
curity, including barriers, fencing, and
tactical infrastructure along the bor-
der. Now they are saying, as the Speak-
er has said, that somehow this is ‘‘im-
moral.’’ Well, this is hypocrisy at its
worst.
NOMINATION OF WILLIAM BARR
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, today the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee is holding a hearing on the
nomination of William Barr to be At-
torney General of the United States.
Mr. Barr is uniquely qualified for this
position in large part because he held
the job before. As a matter of fact, 27
years ago, he was nominated by George
Herbert Walker Bush to be Attorney
General of the United States. He was
confirmed by a unanimous voice vote
in the Senate. It received little fanfare
at the time because it wasn’t particu-
larly controversial—nothing like the
contentious, partisan confirmation
battles we have seen the last 2 years.
There wasn’t an attempt—at least so
far, and I am keeping my fingers
crossed—to assassinate Mr. Barr’s
character or try to decipher the notes
in his high school yearbook like we saw
in the Kavanaugh confirmation hear-
ing. Instead, so far, and to the commit-
tee’s credit, we have focused on his
qualifications.
He is clearly smart, articulate, and
able. He has a clear understanding of
what the role of the Attorney General
is and, more importantly, what it is
not. An Attorney General should not be
a politician. As a matter of fact, the
Attorney General has the very difficult
job of trying to balance his responsibil-
ities as the chief law enforcement offi-
cer in the country enforcing the rule of
law along with the fact that he is a po-
litical appointee of the President’s. To
me, that is one of the most difficult po-
sitions in the Cabinet to hold. But Mr.
Barr has done it before, and I think he
can do it again. He, of course, has great
institutional knowledge about the De-
partment of Justice.
In addition to Attorney General, he
held the job of Assistant Attorney Gen-
eral for the Office of Legal Counsel and
Deputy Attorney General before he was
promoted to the top job.
Back in 1992, when Mr. Barr was con-
firmed, then-chairman of the Senate
Judiciary, Joe Biden—President
Obama’s Vice President—said he would
be a fine Attorney General.
This morning, I heard Mr. Barr dis-
cuss the qualities that undoubtedly led
Senators on both sides of the aisle to
support his confirmation. He spoke of
the importance of acting with profes-
sionalism and integrity. As a matter of
fact, he said that at 68 years old, he ba-
sically had decided to semi-retire, only
to answer the call by the President to
return to public service. He said: I am
completely independent. I will make
the hard decisions. I will make the
right decisions. I will help restore the
reputation of the Department of Jus-
tice and the FBI to an apolitical, a
nonpolitical department, which is ex-
actly what we need.
He wants to make sure that the char-
acter and reputation of the Depart-
ment of Justice is enhanced and re-
stored and then maintained, and then
it could withstand even the most try-
ing political times, including those in
which we presently live.
He spoke of serving with independ-
ence, providing no promises or assur-
ances to anyone or anything, other
than to faithfully execute and admin-
ister the laws of the United States of
America.
It is clear to me that he maintains
the same views he held 27 years ago. I
share his view that the Department of
Justice should function outside of the
highly politicalized times we live in.
The fair and impartial administration
of justice is the highest obligation and
duty of this position.
I believe Mr. Barr is an outstanding
nominee and, once confirmed, will be
an outstanding Attorney General. I
look forward to voting yes on his nomi-
nation.
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Madam President, on the matter of
the government shutdown—the 25 per-
cent of the government that is pres-
ently not funded—last week, I traveled
with the President, along with my col-
league Senator CRUZ, to the Rio
Grande Valley, to McAllen, TX.
After the President held his round-
table, where he saw heroin, meth-
amphetamine, and weapons, and heard
about the human trafficking, including
sex slavery involving children and girls
and women, after that presentation—
after the President left, Senator CRUZ
and I sat down with a number of our
constituents—county judges, mayors,
law enforcement officers, as well as the
folks from Border Patrol and Customs
and Border Protection. They under-
stand the border better than anybody
because they live there. They are deep-
ly concerned about the posturing in
Washington and how the political argu-
ments seem to overcome logic and lis-
tening to the experts when it comes to
border security. I was glad for them to
confirm once again what they pre-
viously told me: that we need to
strengthen those border communities

and keep our country safe, while keep-
ing legitimate trade and commerce
flowing across the border.
During our discussion, Scott Luck,
Deputy Chief of the Border Patrol,
talked about the positive impact of
physical barriers and what positive im-
pact they have at targeted locations
along the southern border. He said:
The physical barrier has worked every
place I have been. I have been in places
where they did not have it; they put it in and
it worked.
He mentioned Douglas, AZ, as one of
those. He said:
There were more people coming into the
country there than any other place in the
country. I was there. It stopped. It stopped in
California. It stopped in Yuma. It stopped in
El Paso. It will stop wherever we put it.
Despite what our colleagues across
the aisle are saying, physical barriers
at the border can be effective when
coupled with technology and personnel.
It doesn’t do you much good to have a
physical barrier that somebody can go
over or around or through and you
don’t have a Border Patrol agent there
to detain them.
Actually, the physical border is the
last place you are going to stop people
trying to illegally enter into the
United States, together with the nar-
cotics and the human trafficking, but
it is important to have those tools
available to the Border Patrol, and
that is what Deputy Chief Luck was
stressing. He made the comments and
observation that physical barriers
alone are not the solution for the en-
tire border—a holistic border security
approach also requires technology and
personnel.
When we were discussing the need for
building physical barriers in strategic
locations, my friend, Cameron County
Judge Eddie Trevino, said something to
Border Patrol Council President Bran-
don Judd that I think encapsulates the
whole debate. He was talking to the
Border Patrol and CBP and said:
If you tell us where you need it, I think we
are all on board. If the politicians tell us
where we need it, I think that is where we
have our concern.
In other words, what Judge Trevino
was saying was, let’s listen to the ex-
perts, the people who know how to use
the right combination of technology,
tactical infrastructure, and personnel
at each given place along the border
because it makes no sense to try to
treat this like a one-size-fits-all. Any-
body who has ever been to the border
between the United States and Mexico
knows that the geography and topog-
raphy vary tremendously from place to
place.
Let’s not try to dictate from Wash-
ington, DC, where every dollar goes
and in so doing try to micromanage the
Border Patrol and Customs and Border
Protection and the Department of
Homeland Security. Let’s leave that to
the experts—the men and women who
work to protect and secure our border
every day.
What we continue to hear and what I
continue to advocate is for a layered
approach—barriers where they are ap-
propriate, technology, and personnel.
That is exactly what we have been
talking about. That is what we voted
for in 2006 with the Secure Fence Act.
The Democrats supported that, along
with Republicans. That is what law en-
forcement officers tell us they need to
operate optimally. Unfortunately, it is
what Democrats are now refusing to
negotiate and provide.
When looking at the border, it is not
just physical security we need to be
concerned about; we need to be con-
cerned about our economic security as
well.
During our discussions last week
with local stakeholders, we also fo-
cused on the importance of facilitating
legitimate trade and travel at our
ports of entry. I was shocked by this
figure, but the Customs and Border
Protection Officer there, Mr.
Higgerson, mentioned that the trade
from Texas ports alone is valued at $300
billion per year. For the State of Texas
and border communities in particular,
these ports fuel our economy, and we
need to provide additional funding to
ensure efficient movement across the
border.
One thing we all agree on is that
most of the high-end drugs—the heroin,
the methamphetamine, and the
fentanyl—come through the ports of
entry. So let’s modernize those. Let’s
provide the technology that is needed
in order to stop the flow of that poison
into the United States. Legitimate
trade and commerce is the lifeblood
not only of our border region in my
State, it is also the lifeblood of our Na-
tion’s economy. There are 5 million
Americans whose jobs depend on bina-
tional trade with Mexico alone.
Along with a number of my col-
leagues from Texas, we are sending a
bipartisan letter to President Trump
that thanks him for his continued
work to secure our southern border.
His advocacy for that layered ap-
proach, as well as for port of entry im-
provements, is vital to my State. In
that letter, we also address recent ru-
mors to the effect that the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers’ funds might be
used for border security purposes, and I
have urged the President not to take
that route. While I will continue to ad-
vocate for additional border security, I
believe those funds were intended to
support disaster relief and should be
used for that purpose. We need both
border security and to lend a helping
hand to those who are still recovering
from natural disasters. We don’t have
to rob from Peter to pay Paul. We need
to do both.
I am grateful for the support that has
been shown from the President to the
people of Texas both in the days fol-
lowing Hurricane Harvey’s landfall and
in the nearly year and a half since, and
I hope he will continue to work with
all of my Texas colleagues and me as
we rebuild our communities impacted
by Hurricane Harvey and as we work
together to secure our border.
Mr. CARPER. Will the Senator yield
for a moment?
Mr. CORNYN. I yield.
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I
thank the Senator for his comments.
As Senator CORNYN lives down at the
border and as his State is on the bor-
der, he is well familiar with that part
of the world.
As it turns out, as the former chair-
man of the Homeland Security Com-
mittee, I have had a chance to visit the
borders in the Senator’s State and in
other States along the Mexican border.
Not that long ago, there were a whole
lot of Mexicans coming into the United
States, as he knows, and not so many
Mexicans going back to Mexico. In the
year 2000, when illegal immigration
peaked, huge numbers of Mexicans
came in—not so much today. As the
Senator knows, they are coming from
Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.
I am a huge advocate of border secu-
rity. I think fencing makes sense in a
lot of places. We have hundreds of
miles of fencing, and in a lot of places,
fences alongside roads make sense. We
have very sophisticated surveillance
equipment that can look from different
platforms. We have drones, fixed-wing
aircraft, helicopters, stationary tow-
ers, and mobile towers that can look
down 20, 25 miles into Mexico and pick
up people who are coming up from the
south. Motion detectors make sense,
and tunnel detectors make sense.
There is a lot of stuff that makes
sense.
I am all for investing there. I think
Democrats and Republicans can find
common ground, and I think we have.
The appropriations bills that we have
passed will actually fund that kind of
stuff. They are not just Democratic
ideas, and they are not just Republican
ideas. They are good ideas, and a lot of
them come from our Border Patrol per-
sonnel, as the Senator knows.
We can do all of this and more on the
southern border with Mexico, but if
people in Honduras, in Guatemala, and
in El Salvador continue to live lives of
misery because we are complicit in our
addiction to drugs, they are going to
still want to come up here. So we need
to be able to walk and chew gum at the
same time and also provide, through
Alliance for Prosperity, which is, real-
ly, a modern-day planned Colombia, a
little bit of hope and opportunity so
they will feel less compelled to come to
this country to have a better life.
Thank you.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, if I
could respond to my friend, the Sen-
ator from Delaware, he speaks cor-
rectly—accurately—about some of the
symptoms and, I think, some of the
cures that we need to put in place to
deal with this extraordinarily complex
problem. We would love to continue to
work with him on coming up with
something. We may not want to call it
‘‘Plan Mexico’’ but ‘‘Plan Americas’’
because what we really have to deal
with is a regional challenge.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S195
January 15, 2019
He is exactly right in that most of
the illegal immigration now is coming
from Central America. Gaps in our im-
migration and human trafficking laws
encourage unaccompanied children and
family units to come up to the border
because they can, essentially, get
placed in the United States while they
wait for their asylum claims to be de-
termined by a court, and there is a
backlog of 700,000 or 800,000 asylum
claims. In other words, the criminal or-
ganizations that move people for
money into the United States have
cracked the code and have figured out
how to be successful in placing people
in the United States.
Unfortunately, it also helps to enrich
those organizations that move the poi-
son from south of the border into the
United States. They contributed to the
deaths of some 70,000 Americans last
year alone. I am thinking particularly
about the fentanyl, along with the her-
oin, going from China to Mexico and up
across the border. Of that consumed in
the United States, 90 percent of it
comes from Mexico. I agree that it is
the demand here in the United States
that enriches the cartels, but they are,
more or less, commodity agnostic. In
other words, they will do anything that
makes them money, these criminal or-
ganizations.
We need to have people sit down and
work together, and I pledge to work
with my colleague to try to do that.
Yet we can’t get a solution as long as
the Speaker of the House calls physical
infrastructure or barriers immoral.
This is kind of a nonstarter to a con-
versation that we need to have to try
to negotiate our way out of this shut-
down.
I welcome working with my friend.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota.
Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ex-
tend my thoughts in regard to the com-
ments made by the senior Senator from
Texas in the need for border security. I
appreciate his comments, and I, cer-
tainly, agree with them.
NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY 2018 FCS
TITLE VICTORY
Madam President, I rise to take a
minute to recognize the incredible
achievements of the North Dakota
State University Bison football team
today.
On January 5, it earned its record
seventh national championship title.
For 7 out of the last 8 years, it has been
the national champion.
In a hard-fought victory, NDSU de-
feated the Eastern Washington Univer-
sity Eagles by a score of 38 to 24 in
Frisco, TX. With that win, the Bison
have now won an unprecedented, as I
say, seventh NCAA Division I football
championship series championship, set-
ting a record for the most FCS titles of
all time. The Bison now have a total of
15 NCAA championship titles. In addi-
tion, the team completed the 2018 foot-
ball season with a perfect record of 15
wins and zero losses, displaying just an
extraordinary resilience and skill.
This achievement puts the 2018 Bison
in, truly, elite company as it has be-
come only the fifth team to cap off an
undefeated season with a national
championship title. The 2018 team joins
the 2013 NDSU team in accomplishing
this impressive feat.
Further, NDSU is one of only five
FCS teams to have ever won back-to-
back titles. NDSU is the deserved hold-
er of the longest title winning streak
in FCS history, with its obtaining five
titles in a row from 2011 to 2015. It has
been victorious in every FCS title
game in which it has played.
After the title game, NDSU quarter-
back Easton Stick became NDSU’s
record holder for the most passing
yards, having a total of 8,693 passing
yards in his college career. He also be-
came the NCAA record holder for the
most all-time FCS wins by a quarter-
back, having a total of 49 career wins.
I also recognize the impressive
achievement of NDSU’s head coach,
Chris Klieman. During his 5 years as
head coach, he led the Bison to an out-
standing record of 69 wins and only six
losses, winning four national cham-
pionships in the process. Coach
Klieman’s achievement of four titles in
5 years equals the NCAA’s FCS record
for obtaining the most titles as a head
coach. Coach Klieman and his entire
staff instilled character and persever-
ance in the members of the NDSU
Bison football team.
While I know it is bittersweet, I am
sure that Bison Nation will join me in
wishing Coach Klieman the best of luck
in his continued career as the new head
coach of the Kansas State University
Wildcats next season. We welcome
Matt Entz as the new head coach, who
was formerly the defensive coordi-
nator. He has, certainly, been part of
this great dynasty.
Finally, I recognize all of Bison Na-
tion for its vibrant and unwavering
support of the team during another
successful season.
As they have grown accustomed to
doing, the welcoming residents of Fris-
co, TX, saw a mass of Bison fans flock
to their town for the FCS champion-
ship game. They were warm and won-
derful in terms of their hospitality. Ap-
proximately 20,000 fans traveled from
North Dakota and other areas to sup-
port our great team. They turned the
stadium into a sea of green and yellow
as they passionately cheered on our be-
loved Bison.
The Bison victory was not only a vic-
tory for the NDSU football team but
for our State as the team brought yet
another trophy back home to North
Dakota. I congratulate the team, the
coaches, and our great, great fans on
another national championship.
Go, Bison.
Again, I am so proud of our great
team, and I appreciate the opportunity
to take this time to recognize its
achievements.
I am pleased to yield the floor to my
fellow Senator from North Dakota.
Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, I
thank my friend and colleague, Sen-
ator HOEVEN.
Before I get into my prepared com-
ments, let me first associate myself
with his words and his eloquent appre-
ciation and congratulations to the
folks at NDSU and to the football
team. Let me just say that I don’t care
what President Trump says—in Bison
Nation, we never get tired of winning.
MARCH FOR LIFE
Madam President, for the first time,
I rise as a Member of this prestigious
body, as a U.S. Senator, to talk about
a critical issue that faces our Nation,
which is every citizen’s right to life.
It is no coincidence that I rise today,
the week of March for Life. This com-
ing Friday is the 46th annual March for
Life, during which citizens from across
the country and hundreds from North
Dakota, especially students from
places like Shanley High School and
the University of Mary and other insti-
tutions around our State, will unite to
fight against the largest, deadliest, and
most silent war this world has ever
known. This, my colleagues, is the war
against the unborn.
During my time in the House of Rep-
resentatives in the last 6 years and
throughout my campaign for the Sen-
ate last year, I promised the people of
North Dakota that I would fight for
life at all stages. I unite, today, with
those who will march this Friday, who
will walk with heavy and hopeful
hearts and who will pray for the 60 mil-
lion discarded children who have been
denied their very first breaths.
Colleagues, I stand here to call to
mind a child’s right to life and protec-
tion within the womb of his or her
mother. Since Roe v. Wade, which the
Supreme Court decided in 1973, over 60
million children have been denied their
right to life. There have been 60 million
children who have been refused love,
comfort, a hug, care, opportunity, and
breath. They were torn from experi-
encing the beauty of the world that we
are so fortunate to see. They were torn
from family and unknown friends.
To deny 60 million innocent children
the right to these things is the highest
injustice to our people and the highest
offense to our God. I speak on behalf of
the citizens of North Dakota and of all
citizens who will gather this week to
say that it is absolutely unacceptable
that within this country, life is treated
as a commodity rather than a gift from
an omnipotent Creator.
Some of my pro-choice colleagues
and friends may say that in taking this
stance, I am standing against women’s
rights—nothing could be further from
the truth—and that this is an issue of
a woman’s right. It is an issue for the
millions of women who have been de-
nied the right to life. I fully support
women’s rights. I just began supporting
them 9 months earlier than some of my
colleagues on the other side of this im-
portant issue.
To my colleagues who are pro-life
who are supportive of this fight, I re-
mind them that abortion is a great in-
justice, but it is particularly common
in situations and communities that

have suffered other injustices. If we are
going to be pro-life, I think we must be
pro all of life and address the factors
that cause women to decide to end the
life of their unborn children.
The United States has seen a great
evil throughout its history. We have
seen and experienced slavery, discrimi-
nation, and human trafficking. All of
these things are illegal, and these
things are issues on which we as a
country take a moral stance. However,
abortion is legal. Sixty million lives
have been ended legally in our country.
Here, in Washington, DC, nearly 40
percent of pregnancies end in abortion.
In New York City, an African-Amer-
ican child is more likely to be aborted
than born. As one Nation under God,
we, as a country, should know better.
We must know better, and I believe we
do know better. No government should
limit the lives of its youngest and most
innocent citizens.
As a Senator, I give you my promise
to fight for life, and I ask my col-
leagues to join me. This is my promise
to the people of North Dakota who
have chosen me as their Senator and
my promise to my fellow citizens, espe-
cially those who have never had the
chance to speak with their voices.
Within my first few weeks here, I
have signed onto several pro-life prior-
ities. I have signed a letter asking
President Trump to veto any legisla-
tion that undermines the right to life.
Additionally, I cosponsored the Protect
Funding for Women’s Healthcare Act, a
bill that would end Federal funding for
Planned Parenthood and shift that
money to women’s health services.
In North Dakota, we don’t have any
Planned Parenthood clinics, but we
have 16 community health centers and
over 20 federally qualified health cen-
ters. Shifting this money toward these
health centers would help the women
in my State to receive better and more
accessible healthcare. Let me say that
again. Shifting funding away from the
abortion clinics and toward these com-
munity health centers would provide
more funds to the health centers that
care for women across the State of
North Dakota.
Additionally, I have cosponsored the
No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and
Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act
and the Title X Prohibition Act, two
bills to protect the taxpayer from fund-
ing the abortion industry.
I have cosponsored the Born-Alive
Abortion Survivors Protection Act,
which would guarantee that a child
who survives an abortion will receive
the same medical care as a premature
child of the same age, and the Child
Interstate Abortion Notification Act,
which protects the rights of parents to
be notified if their child is going to
have an abortion.
Finally, I have cosponsored the Pain-
Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,
which would ban abortion after 20
weeks.
My fellow Senators, I stand here be-
cause of the citizens of North Dakota
and of the United States who desire to
see these bills and many other impor-
tant pro-life bills pass and signed into
law. They want an end to this injus-
tice.
I recognize my responsibility to fight
for the youngest, most vulnerable
members of our society and our future
generations. Today, I stand with my
constituents and with the entire popu-
lation of the United States, especially
the men and women who have been
robbed of their right to life. I urge my
fellow Senators to take a stand on this
pressing issue as well. With our united
efforts, the killing of our unborn citi-
zens will continue to diminish.
Our work is fruitful. In every legisla-
tive session we see more and more laws
passed at the State level to protect un-
born life. From 2008 to 2014, the abor-
tion rate in the United States dropped
by 25 percent. Each year, we are mak-
ing great strides and giving a voice to
the voiceless.
This fight is not a political fight but
a fight for humanity itself. It is a war
against all of us and against all of our
children, no matter our ideologies. We
have to learn to prioritize the issues in
our own parties and work across the
aisle. We have to look at each other
with open minds and open hearts to
solve this crisis that has plagued our
country. We must do better at reaching
out and uniting with one another in de-
fense of one of the most fundamental
rights—the right to life.
The truth is this: We must uphold
this right because ‘‘we hold these
Truths to be self-evident, that all Men
are created equal, that they are en-
dowed’’—at the time of creation—‘‘by
their Creator with certain unalienable
Rights, that among these are Life, Lib-
erty, and the pursuit of Happiness.’’
Without the first—that is the right to
life—we can have neither liberty nor
the pursuit of happiness. We have been
denying the first for far too long. So
let’s join together now to give the fu-
ture of our country, our next genera-
tions, the right to life.
With that, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota.
Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I
would like to commend my fellow Sen-
ator from North Dakota on his heart-
felt comments today and express my
support and agreement with him and
with those comments.
He mentioned a number of pieces of
legislation that he is cosponsoring. I
am pleased to see that. I, again, have
signed onto legislation to support life
in this Congress, as I have in previous
Congresses.
We will have the March for Life at
the end of this week. I look forward to
that. Last year, my wife and her sister
actually walked in the March for Life.
I have always made a practice of greet-
ing our participants in the March for
Life from North Dakota, and I cer-
tainly look forward to seeing them
again here this year.
With that, I thank you for this time
to make these comments, and, again,
to extend a warm welcome to my col-
league from North Dakota. I have
worked with him for many years, and I
very much look forward to working
with him now here in the Senate.
Thank you.

ator from Oklahoma.
NATIONAL DEFENSE
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, in
the floor speech that I gave last week
on the ‘‘Common Sense for Common
Defense,’’ I highlighted the fact that
our competitors have increased their
own military spending and focused on
modernization and how we are going to
have to do the same.
When I talk about competitors, I am
talking about China and Russia. I
think this President did a good job of
outlining our national defense system
and putting it into different categories,
because when you talk about China and
Russia—not many people are aware of
this—China and Russia have increased
all during the years that we have de-
creased. They have actually caught up,
and, in some cases, have actually
passed us.
Our men and women in uniform are
outstanding representations of what is
right in America. Their drive and de-
termination is the reason the United
States of America has the honor of
being the leader of the free world. That
honor, however, is the product of hard
work, not birthright. We earned it.
But over the last 10 years, our mili-
tary supremacy has slowly degraded.
General Dunford, the Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, has acknowledged
that our qualitative and quantitative
advantage has eroded. Toward the end
of the Obama administration, with
many of our systems, like our brigade
combat teams, only 35 percent of them
could be deployed because of what hap-
pened to the defense budget and our
maintenance capabilities.
The same thing happened to our
Army aviation brigades. The same
thing happened to our F18s. It is the
Marines that fly the F18s, and we only
had 30 percent of those that could be
deployed toward the end of the Obama
administration.
This is something that people are not
aware of. This is very significant. We
need to pay attention to this, if there
is ever any question. Constant dollar
defense spending dropped $200 billion
from 2010 to 2015. That was in the last
5 years of the Obama administration.
In 2010, the budget was $794 billion,
and then 5 years later, it dropped down
to $586 billion. That is unprecedented.
Even after the Korean war, it didn’t
drop that much, but, nonetheless, it
did. It has never happened before, and
we have to make up for it.
That is exactly what we are doing.
Our fiscal year 2018 budget brought it
back up to $700 billion. Our 2019 budget
brought it back up to $716 billion, and
we anticipate—and it has been men-
tioned several times—that in our 2020
budget it is going to be around $750 bil-
lion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S197
January 15, 2019
We have a slide here that puts it in a
little different perspective. As you can
see from the slide, at the end of the
Cold War, we had about the same num-
ber of fighter aircraft as our adver-
saries at that time—that was Russia
and China. It is very clear on this. The
orange is the third generation fighters,
and the blue is the fourth generation
fighters. It shows that now we are get-
ting into the fifth generation. Actu-
ally, at that time, we were way ahead
of them. This is a thing of the past
now.
While we had the same amount, we
were still superior because our aircraft
were the newest and the most capable
in the world. Our fighter aircraft—in
fact, most of our military equipment—
was better, more modern, and more ef-
fective than the Russians or the Chi-
nese had. Now that has changed. Dur-
ing this most recent period of time, we
went through about 10 years of not in-
creasing the quality, and the numbers
stayed the same. So we got to the point
where many of the things the Chinese
and Russians had were better than
what we had.
As demonstrated on the chart, our
fighter force was reduced nearly 50 per-
cent in total numbers over the last 25
years, and we failed to modernize. Sec-
retary of the Air Force Heather Wilson,
said our Air Force is too small to do
what the Nation asks. Not only is it
too small, but the average age of our
aircraft is now 28 years old. How many
of us in here drive a car that is 28 years
old?
In 1990, we brought over 500 aircraft a
year—1990, 500 aircraft a year—but re-
cently, that number has been reduced
to 50 a year.
When I go out and talk to people who
are in my State of Oklahoma and any-
where around the country, there is the
assumption that somehow we have the
very best of everything. That used to
be the case. That became the case after
World War II, but then during the last
10 years is when things dropped down.
We are going to have to do better be-
cause, at this rate, it would take us
over 40 years to modernize a fleet that
is already too old and too small. Mean-
while, our adversaries have trans-
formed their aircraft fleets with mod-
ernization programs and have in-
creased their overall size and capabili-
ties. In fact, the Chinese and Russian
air forces have recapitalized and are
now, or soon will be, fielding aircraft
with capability matching our own but
at a much faster rate. If they get to the
point where we are in terms of mod-
ernization, they are already way ahead
of us in terms of numbers. According to
the Chief of Staff of the Air Force,
General Goldfein, if we take no action,
both the Russian and Chinese forces
will be bigger and more technologically
advanced than us. We know this is
true.
Artillery is measured in terms of
rapid fire and range, and that is where
we are falling behind them.
The problem is not just the Air
Force. The Army, likewise, has gotten
smaller and less capable in the same
decade. Specifically, in terms of long-
range fires—defined as tubed artillery
and tactical missiles—you can see the
same trend. This is our artillery sys-
tem. There are three different types of
artillery, but you can see now that as
time has gone by, we have actually
fallen behind. If you look at us over
here, in 2018, our total is 2,886, as op-
posed to 22,000 for the Russians and
10,000 for the Chinese. The numbers are
there, and we know that is happening,
and we know it is taking place as we
speak.
In the last 25 years, we have kind of
rested on that advantage that things
were better than they had. While our
adversaries have also reduced the
amount of long-range fires over the
same period of time, they have signifi-
cantly modernized their force. We are
now in a situation where both of these
countries—that is, Russia and China—
not only have more artillery than us,
but theirs is better than ours.
GEN Mark Milley, the Army Chief of
Staff said: ‘‘In terms of artillery, the
Army is outgunned and outranged by
our adversaries.’’ Unfortunately, peo-
ple don’t know this, and people are
going to have to know this to know
what happened to us in the last decade.
One can look at the devastating re-
sults from Russia’s action against the
Ukrainian army. We all remember that
in 2014 they made it possible through
the modernization of their artillery
systems. The results were there. They
were. They inflicted damage.
Recognizing the problem is normally
the first step in developing an accept-
able solution. The fiscal year 2018 and
fiscal year 2019 budgets got us back in
the right direction, but in fiscal year
2018 we have gone up to $700 billion for
a defense budget and in fiscal year 2019
to $716 billion. So we are on the road to
recovery. We recognize, the people in
this body know, what has happened to
our abilities and our superiority in
these areas that is no longer there.
This is kind of interesting. We had a
hearing on this the other day. Of all
the presentations I have heard, the as-
sessment and recommendations of the
National Defense Strategy Commis-
sion—that is what this book is right
here—was put together a few years ago.
They have actually made these assess-
ments and come to the conclusion that
if we want to do something—what they
have come up with in this is a formula
as to what it is going to take right now
and for the foreseeable future. They
say all of our defense budgets coming
up are going to have to be an increase
of somewhere between 3 percent and 5
percent above inflation. Of course, that
is exactly what these 3 years will do, so
we are making headway in that re-
spect.
This growth projection is also one
our Secretary of Defense as well as our
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
say is going to be necessary for us to
get back up even with and competitive
with both Russia and China.
I can remember not long ago being in
the South China Sea and watching
China actually building islands. It is
not legal, but they do it anyway. If you
look at what is on these seven islands
out there, it is as if they are preparing
for World War III. Our allies in the
South China Sea are very much con-
cerned about this as to whose side they
are going to be on if this happens.
We don’t want to shortchange our na-
tional security. We fully implement
the national defense strategy, as found
in this book, in a timely manner by
avoiding continuing resolutions and
eliminating the threat of sequestra-
tion.
A continuing resolution is something
where, if we don’t get along in this
body, we don’t pass our appropriations
bills as we are supposed to pass, then
we end up passing a continuing resolu-
tion that continues what we have done
in the previous year. We can’t continue
to do that.
The already widening gap with Rus-
sia and China will only grow faster if
we don’t change our behavior. That is
exactly what we plan to do. We need to
fix this if we are going to do it.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

S198 January 15, 2019
DISAPPROVING THE PRESIDENT’S
PROPOSAL TO TAKE AN ACTION
RELATING TO THE APPLICATION
OF CERTAIN SANCTIONS WITH
RESPECT TO THE RUSSIAN FED-
ERATION—Motion to Proceed
Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I rise
to speak against the resolution to dis-
approve of the administration’s agree-
ment to delist Rusal, the Russian alu-
minum giant from the SDN list.
I will vote no today because this was
a hard-fought negotiation, resulting in
one of the strongest agreements ever
associated with a sanctions delisting,
which supports longstanding U.S. sanc-
tions policy and foreign policy toward
Russia.
This agreement does nothing to
change the sealed fate of Deripaska,
the direct target of the sanctions. He
remains sanctioned. His current assets
remain blocked. The primary and sec-
ondary sanctions imposed against him
dash any hope of future deals or in-
come, either by operation of his dives-
titure obligations or future dividends
based on his remaining shareholder in-
terests in Rusal. His ability to transfer
his shares, use his shares as collateral,
or even receive cash from dividends are
all effectively frozen.
The sanctions that put Deripaska on
the SDN list and froze his investments
in Rusal and En+ and ESE, and make
him personally radioactive to future
transactions with just about anyone,
forced these companies to disentangle
themselves from Deripaska’s control
and influence or to face financial dev-
astation.
In fact, the Treasury agreement ap-
propriately reflects how U.S. sanctions
policy uses smart sanctions to change
the behavior of those sanctioned to
build pressure behind the ultimate
goals of U.S. policy toward Putin’s
Russia.
The agreement itself is more akin to
a deferred prosecution agreement, in
that a failure in its terms can result in
an immediate relisting to the SDN list,
while it ensures that En+, Rusal, and
ESE undertake significant restruc-
turing and corporate governance
changes to reverse the circumstances
that led to their designation in the
first place. These actions include re-
ducing Deripaska’s direct and indirect
shareholding stakes; overhauling the
composition of the relevant boards of
directors that control the companies’
operations and strategic direction; re-
stricting the steps that can be taken
relating to their governance; and
agreeing to broad and unprecedented
transparency that requires ongoing au-
diting, certification, and reporting re-
quirements.
Part of keeping a smart sanctions
program smart is to ensure that the
world understands the U.S. sanctions
architecture is fair and respects Amer-
ica’s extraterritorial sanctions reach,
and providing an off-ramp from the
SDN list for those listed who can prove
deserving is not only good sanctions
policy but the law because if Treasury
fails in its ability to render fair judg-
ments, erstwhile petitioners for re-
moval will simply resort to either the
U.S. courts or worse, simply evasion.
In the circumstances of this case,
keeping Rusal on the sanctions list
could lead to a Putin nationalization of
the Russian aluminum industry, which
would not only work to enrich
Deripaska but all but guarantee the
unfettered Kremlin influence in a glob-
al concern that would also invite a set
of unintended consequences involving
wider economic and security costs for
our Nation and for our economic allies.
So today I am voting against Senator
SCHUMER’s resolution to disapprove of
the administration’s agreement to
delist Rusal, the Russian aluminum
giant, from the SDN list because Treas-
ury spent the last 8 months getting it
right and winning a hard-fought dives-
titure agreement. It is among the most
robust and verifiable delisting deter-
minations ever devised by Treasury,
worthy of Senate approval and not a
gift to the Kremlin.
Thank you.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I
come to the floor today in support of
S.J. Res. 2, expressing disapproval of
the Trump administration’s desire to
remove sanctions from companies
owned by Oleg Deripaska. In accord-
ance with specific provisions in a law I
helped write, Countering America’s Ad-
versaries through Sanctions Act, the
Senate has until Thursday to block
this delisting; hence the urgency of
this vote. If we wait, then under the
law, we lose this important oppor-
tunity.
Mr. Deripaska is a notorious Kremlin
crony who may have played a role in
the Russian Government’s attacks dur-
ing the 2016 Presidential election cycle.
At this point, we simply do not know
enough about his potential involve-
ment in the cyber attacks and malign
influence campaigns carried out by the
Kremlin on the American people, and
we will not find out until we see the
full report of Robert Mueller’s com-
pleted investigation. Until then, I am
not comfortable with any measure that
diminishes sanctions pressure on a
powerful Russian oligarch with deep
ties to Vladimir Putin, including this
recent deal agreed to by the Treasury
Department.
I am a strong believer in the power of
sanctions to incentivize behavioral
change in support of our foreign policy
priorities. I also deeply respect the
skill, expertise, and dedication of the
career officials at the Treasury Depart-
ment who administer many of our
sanctions against Russia.
Nonetheless, the deal before us is se-
riously flawed. First, we must be clear
that it is not the American people but,
rather, Oleg Deripaska who would ben-
efit handsomely from this arrange-
ment. After his partial divestment in
En+, which is the holding company for
aluminum giant RUSAL, the Treasury
Department would allow Deripaska to
use a portion of his shares to pay a
very sizable debt to a Russian bank
called VTB. So with the deal,
Deripaska’s overall balance sheet sig-
nificantly improves. This massive ben-
efit to Deripaska alone is enough to
question the merits of this deal.
Moreover, VTB, the Russian bank, is
already on a U.S. sectoral sanctions
list, related to the 2014 Russian inva-
sion of Crimea and Eastern Ukraine.
By allowing VTB, the Russian bank, to
participate in this agreement, the
Treasury Department is undermining
our overall sanctions regime. In effect,
the administration is signaling to
every entity and individual that has
had U.S. sanctions imposed in response
to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine
that they can continue to undermine a
sovereign nation without consequence.
Finally, this deal allows Deripaska to
maintain a 44.9-percent ownership of
En+. While this falls below the Treas-
ury Department’s automatic 50 percent
threshold for ownership, it is still too
high. Yes, perhaps Deripaska has given
up control in a legal sense, a technical
sense, but make no mistake—he will be
the largest shareholder in En+. He will
have the ability to appoint one-third of
its board members, and he will con-
tinue to leverage his network of cro-
nies to influence the conduct of this
company. He also has family members
who independently will have shares. At
the end of the day, he will direct this
company’s future. I find that unaccept-
able. We should all find it unaccept-
able.
No one can deny that we debate this
resolution in an increasingly dire con-
text. On top of the indictments and
pleas piling up in relation to the
Trump campaign’s interactions with
Russian officials or efforts to cover up
those interactions, court filings re-
cently revealed that former Trump
campaign chairman Paul Manafort
shared polling data with Konstantin
Kilimnik during the 2016 Presidential
election cycle.
For years, we have known that Mr.
Kilimnik has served as a key go-be-
tween for Manafort and Oleg
Deripaska. He, too, has suspected ties
to Russian intelligence.
These latest revelations remind us
again that we have more questions
than answers about the relationships
between the President’s associates and
the Kremlin.
If that news was not disturbing
enough, this past weekend, the New
York Times reported that the FBI
opened a counterintelligence investiga-
tion into the President, in part after he
fired the FBI Director because of ‘‘this
Russia thing.’’ Let that sink in. Senior

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S199
January 15, 2019
officials at the FBI—Americans deeply
committed to the hierarchy of law en-
forcement—saw enough evidence to
suspect that Donald Trump, the sitting
President of the United States, could
be an agent of the Russian Govern-
ment. That is stunning. It is absolutely
stunning.
Likewise, over the weekend, the
press reported that President Trump
went to extraordinary lengths to con-
ceal the contents of his conversations
with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki and
elsewhere, even going as far as tearing
up the notes of his interpreter. His own
staff reportedly sought to learn the
contents of the conversation, only to
be told that the interpreter could not
share the details because the President
told him not to.
As the ranking member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, I raised
serious questions about what happened
in Helsinki. I think the whole Nation
was stunned by seeing the President’s
performance there. We wanted to bring
the interpreter forward or to get access
to those notes, and now we know those
notes were destroyed.
Throughout this Presidency, my col-
leagues and I have demanded account-
ability from this administration. I
have been dismayed at the lack of clar-
ity and transparency from the Presi-
dent when it comes to his dealings with
foreign leaders, particularly Vladimir
Putin.
I should note that President Trump
has had numerous conversations with
President Xi of China, Kim Jong Un of
North Korea, and leaders and other
heads of state across the world. We are
not aware of the same standard of se-
crecy being applied to those exchanges.
The President seems to only keep se-
cret his conversations with Putin. And
that begs the question, why? Perhaps
because Trump and his 2016 campaign
staff have repeatedly lied about the ex-
tent of their interactions with Rus-
sians. Perhaps because the Trump-
Putin discussions extended to Russian
financing for the Trump Organization’s
real estate deals throughout the 1990s
and 2000s or the Moscow tower project
we now know the Trump Organization
was still pursuing well into 2017—not
advocating on behalf of the American
people. Perhaps because the President
inappropriately shared classified infor-
mation with Putin, much like he did
when Foreign Minister Lavrov met him
for a meeting in the Oval Office. We
just don’t know, and we have a right to
find out.
I ask that my entire comments be
printed in the RECORD, ending by ask-
ing my colleagues to vote in favor of
moving forward so that this can come
to light.
I yield the floor.
Mr. ISAKSON. If the gentleman
would like to finish his remarks, I
would be glad to yield for a few min-
utes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank my distin-
guished colleague from Georgia—a
member of the committee—for doing
so. I appreciate his courtesy.
As I said, we don’t know, and we have
a right to find out. Our own FBI was
worried he might actually be a foreign
agent.
Presidents certainly have a right to
confidential conversations with world
leaders. Never before in our history
have we had a President under inves-
tigation by the FBI for being a foreign
agent—an agent of the Russian Federa-
tion. With that in mind, I think we
have the right, the responsibility, and
the obligation to ensure that we know
what happened in all of these conversa-
tions between President Trump and
Putin and to understand the full extent
of this relationship.
I sent a letter to the President today,
with the ranking members of the
Armed Services and Intelligence Com-
mittees, demanding the preservation of
all records associated with these meet-
ings and the opportunity to interview
the interpreters. This is a matter of
U.S. national security.
This Trump-Russia connection gets
more confounding by the day. We have
to protect the integrity of all oversight
efforts, including the objective, sober
investigation still being conducted by
Robert Mueller. We must take all
measures necessary to protect this in-
vestigation, including a rock-solid
commitment by the President’s nomi-
nee for Attorney General to not inter-
fere in any way with Mr. Mueller’s
work. The American people deserve to
know who they elected to be their
President and what is going on in this
regard.
Again, it is time to move to legisla-
tion on DASKA, which Senator GRA-
HAM and I have introduced, along with
others. We hope to reintroduce it
again.
I think if this body is serious about
protecting our institutions, our democ-
racy, and about standing up to an in-
creasingly emboldened Kremlin, if we
are serious about our oaths to support
and defend the Constitution, then, No.
1, we will agree to move forward on
this RUSAL question and move for-
ward to find out the rest of the infor-
mation.
I appreciate the distinguished gen-
tleman yielding time.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia.
Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I
wasn’t going to come over here today—
I just got off an airplane a little while
ago—but I am here because of what I
have been hearing.
What I have been hearing is that we
need to be talking about the shutdown
and not other subjects. When I met
with the TSA agents on my plane fly-
ing up here, they said: Why don’t you
get our work back for us?
We are not even talking about TSA.
We are not even talking about the
shutdown. We are talking about dif-
ferent opinions at different times and
different things that don’t really mat-
ter in the scheme of things.
I appreciate what the distinguished
ranking member of the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee just said, but quite
frankly, last week he was talking
about how important it was for us to
stay on the shutdown and not do any-
thing else. Now the leader on the mi-
nority side says it is important for us
to get this Russian gentleman or oli-
garch—whatever that is—whom we are
already punishing, and then we will go
back to the shutdown.
My point is this: There is only one
thing we need to be doing—restoring
the confidence of the American people
in the Senate and the House. They
don’t have it right now. We haven’t
given them anything to hang their hat
on—not a single thing.
We have been shut down for 23, 24
days. I am not a Johnny-come-lately—
pardon the reference—to the issue of
shutdowns. I have been in the Senate
and House for 20 years. I voted against
five shutdowns—every one I had a
chance to. Shutdowns cost the govern-
ment more money; they don’t save the
government any money. They don’t
solve any single problem whatsoever,
even when you mask them by only
shutting down a little bit of the gov-
ernment, like we are right now. Not
much of the government is really shut
down—just the part that hurts the
smallest income earners from our gov-
ernment. We are doing the wrong
thing, punishing the wrong people, and
that is just not right.
All the speeches you are going to
hear today, including mine, don’t mat-
ter at all unless we, first of all, get on
the shutdown, correct the problem, and
find a way to bridge the gap. The Presi-
dent is not moving. The Democrats
aren’t moving. The majority leader is
not moving. We are not doing much.
That doesn’t solve anything. Some-
where along the line, we have to agree
to find a way to do something different
that may not be the end deal but the
bridge to do an end deal, or else we are
all going to look silly.
The truth is, everybody in this nego-
tiation right now is sitting in their of-
fice or sitting and talking to some peo-
ple, having a beer or doing whatever,
and saying: How are we going to stick
them—meaning the other party—and
get this shutdown over before our peo-
ple drive us crazy?
We are caught in our own trap.
Things like what we are debating this
afternoon just emanate that.
This oligarch, who has a huge invest-
ment in the largest aluminum com-
pany in Russia, is being divested of his
interest down from 75 percent, I think,
to 45 percent.
My home country of Sweden—one of
the largest consumers of their product
of aluminum and one of the biggest
sellers of aluminum to the United
States of America—has called me and
said: You all are killing us.
We have driven him down from 75 to
45, and we have some more things to
do. They are losing their vote. I think
their vote is now down to about 25 per-
cent of the board. They have restricted

him every way they can. I am a busi-
nessman; I know how you restrict peo-
ple and tie them down. This deal does
that. It doesn’t give them anything
they don’t want—it gives them a lot of
what they don’t want to have.
So I just want to appeal to everybody
listening to this, all of my colleagues—
I love all of you. We all play political
jokes. We can talk about how the
Democrats did this and the Repub-
licans did that. But the fact is, we are
not doing a damn thing while the
American people are suffering. The
TSA agents I talked to in Atlanta
today were doing it out of the goodness
of their hearts. A lot of the guys and
ladies are not showing up for work, and
there are going to be more of them.
We have the Superbowl coming to At-
lanta, GA, in about 3 weeks—the big-
gest tourism event in the world this
year. What if the largest airport in the
world that is going to bring all the peo-
ple to the largest football game in the
world goes out of business because of
the TSA strike? You will have just cost
millions of dollars for the United
States of America, for my home city—
the city of Atlanta—and others. There
are thousands of examples just like
this.
I have had three people from my
State call me. A convention is coming
up in one of our cities, and this shut-
down is going to hurt the ability to
bring that here. We are going to lose
the revenue we would normally get
from that. So we need to think about
what we are doing. We are not winning
any points with anything.
A lady who was waiting with me to
get on the plane just laughed when I
gave my answer to the TSA agent. I
turned to her and almost asked: Why
are you laughing? I said: You know, I
understand why you are laughing be-
cause I can’t explain it either.
We need to understand what we are
doing and why we are doing it. What we
are doing doesn’t make any sense.
What does make sense is resolving to
go out and solve the problem. Senator
SCHUMER, Senator MCCONNELL, Senator
CRAPO, and I—and all of us—should get
together in a room and give the press
something to really write about—of
our having a meeting of 100 people who
caused the problem and saying: Let’s
find a way to solve the problem or to at
least agree to get us back to business,
to at least agree to not affect the low-
est income people on our payroll, be-
cause the higher income people aren’t
suffering. Let’s get the work done.
Let’s get it worked out. Let’s not call
it a Republican shutdown or a Demo-
cratic shutdown. It is an American
shutdown.
I see that Senator SCHUMER is com-
ing. I don’t usually get this riled up,
CHUCK. I apologize because I am riled
up a little bit.
It is just silly. I used to be able to ex-
plain anything. I was a pretty good
real estate salesman for a long time. I
could close a deal. I can’t close this
one. I had to three or four times on
that Delta plane today, as I came up
here, and I couldn’t do it. When I lis-
tened to the answers I was giving these
people—good, old American citizens—
as to why we can’t get the government
open, I thought, if I were they, I would
not vote for me either.
So let’s get to work. Let’s stop blam-
ing everybody else. Let’s put the blame
where it belongs—on all of our shoul-
ders collectively. Let’s do what we
elected officials were elected to do, and
let’s make a deal.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I
am not going to talk about the sub-
stance of what we are here for.
To my dear friend, JOHNNY, whom I
love and who serves the best barbecue
I ever have every year, among his
many other attributes, I will just make
this point.
He says it is not a Democratic shut-
down or a Republican shutdown. It is a
Trump shutdown. We all know it. Don-
ald Trump has called for the shutting
down of the government 25 times. He
said at our meeting he is proud to shut
down the government.
We Democrats do not want to shut
down the government. In fact, our slo-
gan—our watchword—is ‘‘open up the
government.’’ We have a difference on
border security. We are for it. You are
for it. You are for something different
than we are, but we are not shutting
down the government, and everyone
knows it. The public opinion polls
know it. There are 40 percent of all Re-
publicans, let alone Democrats and
Independents, who are for the wall, and
most of those people say the govern-
ment shouldn’t be shut down over the
wall.
I know how aggravated my colleague
is. I would suggest to him that the best
solution is to vote for what he voted
for—or the whole Republican Party did
by unanimous consent—which is to
open up the government. Then we can
discuss our border security issues.
I yield to my dear friend.
Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I
will follow up on the Senator’s points.
We need to do what we did last year
when Republicans and Democrats
stayed up here for 2 weeks while the
government was shut down. We worked
out an immigration agreement, and we
got the DACA situation fixed. The
President came out for a large number
of DACA improvements. We almost got
there. We fell short, I think, by six
votes. The leader and I were on the
same side, and a lot of us in here, from
both parties, were on the same side.
Those are the types of answers we
need. We need to push to get that done.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I
thank my colleague.
There is just one difference between
what happened then and what is hap-
pening now: Neither side was shutting
down the government until it got its
way.
I will make my statement, I guess,
and wait for Leader MCCONNELL and
the motion to proceed.
S.J. RES. 2
Madam President, before we take a
vote on the motion to proceed on this
resolution, I will make two brief
points, and I know my colleagues have
discussed this very well.
First, my friends the Republican
leader and former Republican whip
Senator CORNYN are being incredibly
disingenuous to suggest this is a polit-
ical stunt and to accuse Democrats of
forcing this vote out of the blue. The
timing of this vote was not determined
by me or by Leader MCCONNELL. It was
determined by the wall. The law says
that we only have 30 days to disapprove
of sanctions relief on Russia. This was
filed right before Christmas.
I would suggest the administration
and the Treasury hope to get away
with it because they know how unpopu-
lar it would be to remove sanctions on
Deripaska or on the companies he con-
trols. They knew how unpopular it
would be, so they snuck it in right be-
fore Christmas, right before we left. We
have only 30 days, and those 30 days ex-
pire on Thursday. If we wait, those 30
days will expire—they will be gone—
and we will have no opportunity. So
this is no accident.
If Leader MCCONNELL and Senator
CORNYN want to know why this vote is
today, they should talk to the White
House, because it is the one that filed
this on December 21.
Second, there are serious, sub-
stantive reasons to oppose the Treas-
ury plan. It fails to sufficiently limit
Mr. Deripaska’s stake in these three
Russian companies. It gives Vladimir
Putin exactly what he wants—sanc-
tions relief on three major producers of
aluminum and other metals. That is
wrong for the country. Putin’s Russia
continues to run rampant over inter-
national norms, to meddle in demo-
cratic elections, and to destabilize the
world. Russia has violated the sov-
ereignty of Ukraine, has interfered in
our elections and the Brexit vote, has
propped up the brutal Assad regime,
and has been implicated in nerve agent
attacks on the soil of our closest ally.
Yet the Trump administration pro-
poses reducing sanctions on Putin and
his cronies.
Show me the behavior from Vladimir
Putin that warrants such relief. I can’t
think of any, and I will bet 90 percent
of all Americans can’t think of any.
Let me be clear. A vote against this
resolution—a vote to not allow us to
proceed—is a vote to go easy on Presi-
dent Putin and his oligarchs.
I understand my friend the leader,
the Republican leader, will move to
table the motion to proceed to the res-
olution. I remind my colleagues that

the timeline runs out on Thursday—48
hours from now. We have to take this
vote now. I strongly urge my col-
leagues to vote no on the motion to
table and yes on the motion to proceed.
MOTION TO PROCEED
Madam President, I move to proceed
to Calendar No. 13, S.J. Res. 2.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the motion.
The bill clerk read as follows:
Motion to proceed to the consideration of
S.J. Res. 2, a joint resolution disapproving
the President’s proposal to take an action
relating to the application of certain sanc-
tions with respect to the Russian Federa-
tion.
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask for the yeas
and nays.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a
sufficient second?
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.
The yeas and nays are ordered.
The majority leader.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
I believe the Senate’s voice should, in-
deed, be heard on national security pol-
icy. This is why I have moved to have
the Senate’s first legislative business
this Congress be a bipartisan package
of foreign policy bills. I made it our
first priority to move legislation that
would have helped defend Israel and
Jordan and provide justice for the Syr-
ians who have been tortured and mur-
dered by the Assad regime, but the
Democrats have repeatedly blocked
that important legislation.
The Democratic leader said the Sen-
ate shouldn’t do any business during
this partial government shutdown, but,
apparently, he didn’t actually mean it
because now the Democratic leader
would like to dictate the terms of a de-
bate on Russia.
We Republicans are hardly strangers
to the need for strong policies con-
cerning Russia. We have long seen
Vladimir Putin for the KGB thug that
he is. We have long advocated for tough
measures against him and the
kleptocrats who surround him. Just
ask the junior Senator from Utah who,
only 6 years ago, was mocked by the
other side for advocating tough policies
against the Kremlin.
This Republican administration has
taken far tougher measures against
Russia than the previous administra-
tion did. It has designated 272 Russia-
related individuals and entities for
sanctions, expelled scores of Russian
intelligence officers, shuttered Russian
diplomatic outposts, and equipped
Ukraine and Georgia to defend them-
selves against Russian aggression.
Clearly, there is more work to be done,
and I look forward to this Congress’s
taking additional steps to defend our
interests against the Russian threats
and to additionally impose costs on
Putin.
Specifically, I look forward to seeing
whether the Democrats will join us in
providing additional funding to rebuild
our military in key areas to deter and
defend against Russian investments
and key weapons systems.
I look forward to seeing whether the
Democrats will support efforts to mod-
ernize our aging nuclear triad as the
Russians have done.
I look forward to the Congress’s re-
viewing its existing sanctions policies
to see how we can impose additional
costs on Putin and his cronies who en-
able his malign activities.
I look forward to the Congress’s en-
suring that our sanctions efforts re-
main multilateral and maximize sup-
port from our European allies, whose
participation is essential to imposing
meaningful costs on the Kremlin.
But, in this narrow case, career civil
servants at the Treasury Department
simply applied and implemented the
law Congress itself wrote and which
the Democratic leader supported.
Treasury’s agreement maintains sanc-
tions on corrupt Russian oligarch
Deripaska. It would continue limiting
his influence over companies subject to
the agreement.
In addition to subjecting the compa-
nies and their officers to the unprece-
dented transparency and monitoring
requirements, the agreement preserves
Treasury’s ability to snapback sanc-
tions on the companies and their offi-
cers. If there is any evidence of further
malfeasance, I expect Treasury to use
that authority to the fullest.
In the meantime, the Democratic
leader’s political stunt should be re-
jected. I move to table this effort to
overturn the hard and painstaking
work of the career officials at Treas-
ury, but I look forward to continuing
our efforts to hold Putin and his cro-
nies accountable in a thoughtful, far
less politicized manner.

PROCEED

ceed to S.J. Res. 2, and I ask for the

DISAPPROVING THE PRESIDENT’S

The legislative clerk read as follows:
A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 2) dis-

an action relating to the application of cer-
tain sanctions with respect to the Russian
Federation.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

RIGHT TO LIFE
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, it is
amazing how much we talk about our
kids. People talk about bipartisan
things here all the time. There is a bi-
partisan conversation often about our
families and about our kids and how
proud of them we are and about shar-
ing our lives with each other.
My two daughters are a remarkable
part of my family, of who I am. I can’t
even process life without thinking
about the two of them.
Our kids are some of the most valu-
able moments of our entire lives and
our greatest memories. When they
were little, we looked into their eyes
and saw potential, and we dreamed for
them. From our earliest days of preg-
nancy, Cindy and I talked about the fu-
ture for our girls as we prayed for
them, thought about them, prepared
for them, and it had sunk in what an
incredible responsibility they really
were. Kids are that way. That is that
earliest moment that we talk about all
the time.
What is remarkable about this photo
is thinking about just exactly what
this moment could be like because, in
this moment, there are really two di-
rections that it could go in America.
This little one was born several weeks
early. For that little one, life could
have gone in two different directions.
This group of doctors is gathered
around this little one, delivering this
child, and watching him take his very
first breath. Only seconds before that,
that same little one we see there with
this same group of doctors could have
been destroyed—that life in the
womb—and it would have been OK.
You see, in America, this moment
could go two different directions at any
time. This life could be there, and we
could watch the decades ahead of him
or, seconds before this picture was
taken, when that child was still in the
womb, that life could have been de-
stroyed, and no one would have paid at-
tention because the determination of
whether this is a child or whether this
is just a little lump of tissue is deter-
mined by a few seconds in a delivery
room. If it is still inside the womb, it
is not a child; it is just tissue. A few
seconds later, when he is delivered, ev-
eryone smiles and looks at the face of
this baby and says: What a beautiful
child, and what a remarkable miracle
that is.
How do we do that in America? How
do we decide what is life and what is
just tissue?
Some people would say it is only a
child if we believe it is a child. If we
don’t believe it is a child, it is not a
child; it is only tissue.
Some people say it has incredible
value, and we should prepare for his or
her college, and we should think and
pray about his future and his spouse
and what he is going to do. Some peo-
ple would say it is meaningless—just
flesh that can literally be put into a
bag and taken to the curb. The deter-
mination is really by the mom and the
dad there. They get to choose whether
that is a child or whether that is tis-
sue.
I honestly don’t understand that con-
versation because when I look at this
child with fingers and toes and hair
and unique DNA, there is nothing dif-
ferent about that child right there
than this child. You see, that child
whom we saw in the picture before is
the same age as this one, but, this
time, this is a 3D ultrasound taken in-
side the womb, but there is no dif-
ference between the two. Both of them
have faces and fingers and toes and
nervous systems and functioning
brains and lungs. They have DNA that
is different from their moms and their
dads—DNA that is unique to those peo-
ple. Whether you can see him or not,
that heartbeat and that DNA is a child.
In America, we still have this ongo-
ing dialogue: When is ‘‘life’’ life?
I heard someone earlier jokingly say
that if this life were discovered on
Mars, we would say Mars had life on it,
but we are still discussing whether this
life is a life on Earth. What do we do
with that?
Here is what we continue to debate
and continue to have a conversation
about. On January 22, 1973, the Su-
preme Court ruled on what is now the
infamous Roe v. Wade decision. It was
supposed to have settled the issue
about life. It was supposed to have set-
tled the issue that every single State
has to allow abortion and that life, ac-
cording to the Supreme Court in 1973,
was about viability. When can this
child live on his own outside the
womb—viability?
Viability in 1973 was very different
than viability now, thankfully. When
we think about viability now, there are
people born at 21 or 22 weeks—ex-
tremely early—who would have never
survived in 1973 but who regularly sur-
vive now because of great medical care.
Viability really doesn’t determine life,
though. Life is something that begins
much earlier, and for some reason in
our culture, we are still having a con-
versation about what to do with that
tissue.
As Americans, we spend a lot of time
trying to work on very difficult issues,
but for some reason, this has become a
partisan issue that is exceptionally di-
visive in this culture. This life and this
child shouldn’t be a partisan issue.
This shouldn’t be a Republican child or
a Democratic child. This should just be
a child, and we should be able to pause
for a moment and determine what we
are going to do about her and deter-
mine: Is she valuable?
As a culture, we spend billions of dol-
lars caring for the homeless because we
believe that every single life matters
and that no life can just be thrown
away just because one struggles with
life. We spend billions of dollars caring
for the oldest and the weakest in our
society because they need 24-hour care
and because we respect that life and
the dignity that it carries. We demand
equal protection for women and men of
all races, all ages, all sexual orienta-
tions, all faiths. We demand that as a
culture because we believe, as a cul-
ture, that every person should have re-
spect and every person should have op-
portunity because of one’s great poten-
tial.
We pat ourselves on the back when
we adopt abused animals, when we
stand up against human trafficking
worldwide, when we help clean up
ocean trash, or when we plant trees to
beautify our communities. Yet we are
having a tough time considering that
child as a child.
We even require that cigarettes, alco-
hol, theme park rides, medicines, and
many other products have warning la-
bels on them to warn pregnant moms
not to use the product because it could
harm the child because, as a culture,
we acknowledge that a mom’s smoking
hurts a child. Yet, for some reason, we
can’t seem to acknowledge that a child
could be hurt by an abortion and that
it really would end a life.
It is my guess that anyone who dis-
agrees with this has already tuned me
out because, as a culture, we don’t
want to think about this life because
if, for a moment, we pause and consider
that maybe she is really alive and has
purpose and value, we would have to
swallow hard and acknowledge the mil-
lions of little girls just like her who
have died in abortions in America—
millions. To fight against having to
deal with that, we just don’t want to
think about it, and we just tune it out.
Yet, if you are one of the folks who has
actually stuck with me through the
dialogue, let me walk through a couple
of things just to think about.
Let’s start with a few things—the
science. This little girl has DNA that is
different than her mom’s and dad’s. It
has cell division. It has something that
we would look at in normal embryonic
development called the Carnegie stages
of embryonic development.
For years and years, every medical
school teaches the Carnegie stages of
embryonic development. They look at
cell division at the beginning point and
acknowledge, as they go through the

process, that this is a child from the
earliest moments and that it is a stage
of life. Every single person who can
hear me right now has gone through
the Carnegie stages of embryonic de-
velopment, just like this little one has.
Every person has because we under-
stand that it is a natural part of life,
that it is a stage of life, that it is an
acknowledgment of life.
It is something that we acknowledge
in the animal world because this Con-
gress has passed laws to deal with en-
dangered species, including a $100,000
fine if you damage a golden eagle’s egg,
a bald eagle’s egg, if you go to marine
turtles’ nesting spots to destroy or to
even disturb the nests of marine tur-
tles. In Oklahoma, we deal with barn
swallows that will build their nests in
the springtime in construction areas.
All construction has to stop if a barn
swallow builds a nest in a construction
area, because those eggs are important,
not so much because of the barn swal-
low but because there is a common un-
derstanding in this Congress that those
eagle eggs, turtle eggs, and barn swal-
low eggs are future barn swallows, tur-
tles, and eagles. We acknowledge that
it is a life that is in process. So we pro-
tect it, but we can’t seem to make the
simple, logical step that that eagle egg
becomes an eagle and she is a little
girl.
The science screams at us in this
area, but for many people, they just
don’t want to think about it because,
at this stage, she is in the womb. She
is invisible. She hasn’t reached the
stage at which you can see her. For
many people, they say: She is only
alive when I can see her. If I can’t see
her, she is not real.
The problem is that the science
doesn’t prove that out.
The second issue that we have to deal
with is where we are as a culture and
where we are as a country compared to
other countries on this simple issue
about looking at this little one and
asking: Is that a child or is that just
tissue? Where is the rest of the world
on this?
It is interesting to note that the rest
of the world is in a very different spot
than is the United States on this. This
is a simple map of the world. Most of
the world—and you will see it in gray
here—says that abortion should stop at
12 weeks. That is 3 months. After 3
months, you can’t have an abortion
anymore.
There are seven countries in the
world that will allow abortion all the
way up to 24 weeks. They are the coun-
tries that are here in black—Canada,
the United States, China, North Korea,
Vietnam, Singapore, and the Nether-
lands. They allow abortions up to 24
weeks.
At 24 weeks and on, in the third tri-
mester, there are only four countries in
the world that allow late-term abor-
tions—only four—China, North Korea,
Vietnam, and the United States. Ev-
erywhere else in the world looks at
that child and says that the child is a
child—fully viable—except the United
States, China, North Korea, and Viet-
nam. Now, that is not a club I really
want us to be in.
All of Europe has banned late-term
abortion—all of it. All of Africa, most
of Asia, and all of Central and South
America have looked at this, and as
separate cultures, they have said no to
a late-term abortion—that he is a fully
viable child.
Interestingly enough, there was a
survey that just came out today—a na-
tionwide survey—that asked Ameri-
cans’ opinions on this issue about life.
There were 75 percent of Americans
who said there should not be abortion
after 12 weeks of pregnancy—that is 3
months—except to protect the life of
the mom. This was 75 percent of Ameri-
cans. They are with this part of the
world. This part of the world all says
that same thing. That is most of Eu-
rope, and most of that area says OK to
12 weeks, but that after 12 weeks, you
have to stop because the child has a
functioning nervous system and brain
and is developing in all of those areas.
Even if you don’t acknowledge where
I am, where I believe that life begins—
at conception—why can’t you at least
acknowledge that at 12 weeks, which is
where most of the rest of the world is,
he is a child that should be protected?
At what point do we, as Americans,
slow down enough to look at what we
don’t want to look at and at what the
rest of the world has done, except for
Vietnam, North Korea, and China? Why
do we want to be in that group when we
deal with the issue of life? Those are
some of the worst human rights viola-
tors in the world. Why are we in that
club?
Folks have recently said to me: You
know, I understand this is a legislative
issue, but it is really a faith issue. This
is really about your faith, and your
faith should not legislate who I am.
I would only tell you that a culture
makes decisions, including our culture,
not just about its faith but about its
values as a culture.
Stealing is also a religious issue. It is
in the Ten Commandments. So maybe,
as a culture, we shouldn’t ban stealing
because the Ten Commandments say
you shouldn’t steal. No one would real-
ly say that because, as a culture, we all
look at it and say that theft is a prob-
lem, that you shouldn’t be able to do
that.
A culture makes its decisions based
on its own personal values. So it is not
just a religious issue, but our faith
does impact our personal lives and de-
cisions. It does affect who we are.
In China, where most faith is banned,
they allow abortion at any stage. In
fact, in China the state is the most im-
portant thing. Everything is about
building up the state. The individual
has no value. The state has the great-
est value. China determines it has too
many people. So it forces women to
have abortions. It compels them. Some
can only have one child, and some can
have two children, but every child after
that has to be aborted because the
state chooses that. Its greatest value is
the state.
Our greatest value is the individual.
That is why our documents begin with
things like ‘‘we the people,’’ because
the individual has value. We look at
the senior adults who are in the nurs-
ing homes and provide care for them.
We look at the homeless person, the
child who is in need of food, and that
little girl who is still in the womb, and
we say they all have value because the
individual has importance.
I had someone who caught me and
said: You know, your faith has this
whole verse in the Bible that says: ‘‘I
was knit together in my mother’s
womb.’’ So this is a religious issue.
You have a belief that each child was
knit together by God in their mother’s
womb.
Then they paused and said: That is
fine for you to have that belief, but I
have the belief that they were knit to-
gether, but it is when they are not
done. They are not fully knit together.
They are not really a shirt. They are
only a sleeve, and if they are still in
development, then, they are not fully
developed. They are not really a child
yet.
I smile at that and say: Actually, al-
though this child was born premature,
you are right. She is not fully devel-
oped. It is not just a sleeve. It is just a
smaller shirt, but she will get there be-
cause everything about your life’s de-
velopment—your hair color, your
height, your health—is all bound up in
those first cells as they start dividing
in your own unique DNA.
This is not about a religious convic-
tion. This is about a child and who we
are as a culture.
Let me say this: I understand there is
a lot of conversation about this. As I
mentioned before, this has become a
partisan, divisive issue. This is not try-
ing to be a Republican or Democrat. I
have met Republicans and Democrats
who both can look at this picture and
say that is a child, not tissue.
This shouldn’t be a divisive or polit-
ical issue, neither should this be an at-
tacking and condemning issue of the
moms and dads who have walked
through abortion. Quite frankly, I have
great compassion for them. For those
moms who have had an abortion, that
memory never goes away for them.
Years later, they sit in the food court
at the mall and watch a small child
playing nearby and think: That is how
old my child would be right now if they
were still alive. I have not met a mom,
ever, who wasn’t affected by abortion
and the memories that come back to
them on that.
This is not a flippant issue for any
person who goes through an abortion. I
grieve for those folks and the struggle
they have, but I also grieve for us as a
nation in the devaluing of something
so obvious as a child. We can do better
as a country, but the first thing we
have to do is stop and look.
As a nation, we have been through
some moments that we are not proud

of, but as a nation, we are proud of who
we can become. As a nation, we are not
proud that at one point, we declared
African-American men and women as
three-fifths of a man. As a nation, we
are not proud of that. As a nation, we
are not proud that we once told women
they could not vote. As Americans, we
are not proud that at one point, we
took Japanese-Americans and interned
them in camps because we were afraid
of them. As Americans, we are not
proud of those moments.
I pray there is a day that we are not
proud that we looked away from little
girls and little boys and said: You are
not human enough yet. Your life can be
ended because I don’t want to look at
you.
The beginning for us, really, is to
stop and look at what is obvious. That
is a child. What are you going to do
about that child?
One of the great books of the 20th
century was written by a man named
Ralph Ellison, who, by the way, was an
Oklahoman. Ralph Ellison was a tre-
mendous African-American author. In
the early 20th century, he wrote a book
called ‘‘Invisible Man.’’ It is a remark-
able journey to look into that time pe-
riod. The author, who is really writing
as the narrator of the book, is telling
his story.
In the prologue of the book, there is
a section I want to read to you because
I think it is powerful, just thinking
about the philosophy that Ralph Elli-
son put out. He said this:
I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone,
fiber and liquids—and I might even be said to
possess a mind. I am invisible, understand,
simply because people refuse to see me. Like
the bodiless heads you see sometimes in cir-
cus sideshows, it is as though I have been
surrounded by mirrors of hard, distorting
glass. When they approach me they only see
my surroundings, themselves, or figments of
their imagination—indeed, everything and
anything except me.
Nor is my invisibility exactly a matter of
biochemical accident to my epidermis. That
invisibility to which I refer occurs because of
a peculiar disposition of the eyes of those
with whom I come in contact. A matter of
the construction of the inner eyes, those
eyes with which they look through their
physical eyes upon reality.
Ralph Ellison was saying in the early
20th century that White America, when
they ran into Black America, refused
to look and ignored them as if they
were invisible and just walked on.
As a culture, I am grateful that
Americans are opening their eyes to
each other as friends and as neighbors
and as Americans. I wonder, one day,
when the peculiar eyes that choose to
pretend that this child is invisible,
simply because she looks like this,
when our peculiar eyes choose to look
at what we have chosen to say is invis-
ible and to turn away and to say: Let’s
see what we do as a culture. Let’s
march for life. Let’s speak out for what
is obvious, and let’s determine what to
do in the next step.
With that, I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms.
MCSALLY). The clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I
want to spend a few minutes talking
about the partial government shut-
down, which is happening right now,
and, more importantly, related to it,
the men and women of the U.S. Coast
Guard who are working today, like
every other member of the military,
risking their lives here, in my State of
Alaska, and overseas in the Middle
East, and are not getting paid to do so.
They are the only branch of the U.S.
military not getting paid to risk their
lives for their country. They missed
their first paycheck today, but here is
the good news. We are offering a solu-
tion—a solution that is working
through the Federal Government that
has a lot of potential.
Before I get to that, I want to talk a
little bit about the partial government
shutdown itself and make clear that I
believe the Trump administration’s ef-
fort to secure the border should be part
of the solution. Every nation has the
right and has the responsibility to pro-
tect its citizens and to protect its sov-
ereignty. In my view, this is something
that should not be controversial. Every
nation has the right and responsibility
to do this, and that is what the citizens
of each country expect. It should not
be controversial.
In fact, over the past 25 years, every
single President of the United States—
Democrat and Republican—has at-
tempted to secure the southern border
and has come before the Congress and
said: I am going to secure the southern
border. They have campaigned on se-
curing the southern border. They have
all said this. Even the Members of Con-
gress—Democrats and Republicans—
year after year have come to the floor
of both Houses and said: We need to do
it.
In a big speech in 2014, President
Obama called the situation on the
southern border a crisis. That was 4
years ago. He called it a crisis—the
previous President, President Obama. I
agreed with his assessment then, and I
agree with President Trump’s assess-
ment now, which is the same assess-
ment.
That is why the President is asking
for $5.7 billion to secure our border. It
is not an unreasonable request, par-
ticularly, when Members of this body,
just last spring, when we were debating
immigration reform, voted for dollar
amounts that were much greater than
that. Again, Democrats and Repub-
licans, last spring, debating on the
floor of this body immigration reform
and border security, voted way north of
$5.7 billion.
This is just one of the many solu-
tions we need to grapple with in order
to have a functional immigration sys-
tem that secures our border, enforces
the law, helps to grow our economy,
and, importantly, keeps families to-
gether. Securing the border is an im-
portant goal.
I am hoping that as we all work on
this, Speaker PELOSI, Minority Leader
SCHUMER, the President, and my Re-
publican colleagues could get to a com-
promise on this issue soon. We all need
to come together.
The good news, as I mentioned, is
that we might be on the verge of com-
ing together—those parties that I just
mentioned—on one of the issues that
relate to securing our border, that re-
late to this broader challenge on the
partial government shutdown involving
the U.S. Coast Guard. I am hopeful
that this could be a template for get-
ting out of the broader partial govern-
ment shutdown.
As you know, the partial government
shutdown is negatively impacting Fed-
eral workers, but none—none—more so
than the brave men and women of the
U.S. Coast Guard. As I mentioned, they
are currently the only members of the
U.S. military who are not getting paid
during this partial government shut-
down. The Army, the Navy, the Air
Force, and the Marines are all out
there risking their lives for our Nation.
We greatly appreciate that. And guess
what. They are getting paid to do it, as
they should be, but the Coast Guard
members are also out there risking
their lives, especially in my State, the
great State of Alaska. They are out on
the Bering Seas, some of the roughest
and most dangerous oceans in the
world, keeping our fishermen safe and
doing rescues. They are deployed over-
seas. They are deployed in the Middle
East. They have been in Florida and
Texas helping with natural disasters,
hurricanes—all heroic service. There
have been many shutdowns before in
the Federal Government, unfortu-
nately, dating back decades, but this
might be the first time ever that you
have every branch of the military
being paid during the shutdown, with
the exception of one.
Let me read a letter from the com-
mandant of the Coast Guard, ADM Karl
Schultz, to the men and women of the
Coast Guard.
To the Men and Women of the United
States Coast Guard,
Today you will not be receiving your regu-
larly scheduled mid-month paycheck. To the
best of my knowledge, this marks the first
time in our Nation’s history that service-
members in a U.S. Armed Force have not
been paid during a lapse in government ap-
propriations.
That is the first paragraph in the
Commandant’s letter to all the mem-
bers of the U.S. Coast Guard. It is the
first time in the U.S. history we are
doing this to members of the military.
Madam President, I ask unanimous
consent that the letter be printed in
the RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:

receiving your regularly scheduled mid-
month paycheck. To the best of my knowl-
edge, this marks the first time in our Na-
tion’s history that servicemembers in a U.S.
Armed Force have not been paid during a
lapse in government appropriations.
Your senior leadership, including Sec-
retary Nielsen, remains fully engaged and we
will maintain a steady flow of communica-
tions to keep you updated on developments.
I recognize the anxiety and uncertainty
this situation places on you and your family,
and we are working closely with service or-
ganizations on your behalf. To this end, I am
encouraged to share that Coast Guard Mu-
tual Assistance (CGMA) has received a $15
million donation from USAA to support our
people in need. In partnership with CGMA,
the American Red Cross will assist in the
distribution of these funds to our military
and civilian workforce requiring assistance.
I am grateful for the outpouring of support
across the country, particularly in local
communities, for our men and women. It is a
direct reflection of the American public’s
sentiment towards their United States Coast
Guard; they recognize the sacrifice that you
and your family make in service to your
country.
It is also not lost on me that our dedicated
civilians are already adjusting to a missed
paycheck—we are confronting this challenge
together.
The strength of our Service has, and al-
ways will be, our people. You have proven
time and again the ability to rise above ad-
versity. Stay the course, stand the watch,
and serve with pride. You are not, and will
not, be forgotten.
Semper Paratus,
ADMIRAL KARL L. SCHULTZ,
Commandant.
Mr. SULLIVAN. Nobody thinks this
is a good idea. Nobody thinks this is a
good idea. So last week, a number of us
in this body, Democrats and Repub-
licans, put forward a bill that simply
says we should pay the men and women
of the Coast Guard, even if we are in a
partial government shutdown, just like
paying the men and women of the
other branches of the military. They
are risking their lives daily. They can’t
just quit their job. By the way, if they
want to just go quit, they are going to
be court-martialed. That is different
than other Federal service. So that is
what we said we were going to do.
When the President came to the Sen-
ate last week, I had the opportunity to
raise this issue with the President and
his team and highlighted the fact that
this is very different, and we need to
work together. We have a bill. If we get
the President’s support and signature
on it, that would be a good way to
move it forward, and I have been in
communication with his administra-
tion ever since the lunch—working
with us.
I am hopeful we are on the verge of a
breakthrough because the White House
has said the President recognizes this
is a rather unique situation—very
unique—so he has now said he is going
to support this bill. We have Demo-
crats, Republicans, the White House,
and the President of the United States
all saying, all right, we are not there
yet, but this is a good start, and this is
an important issue.
What is going on right now in this
body is we are trying to UC this. We
are trying to get unanimous consent
from Democrats and Republicans on
this bill. Again, leadership on the
Democratic side and on the Republican
side have all supported this bill: pay
the Coast Guard like the other mili-
tary servicemembers. The White House
is now supportive. Hopefully, tonight
we are going to get this cleared, and we
are going to get it over to the House;
Speaker PELOSI and her team will rec-
ognize how dire and important this is—
just like Democrats, Republicans, the
President, and Secretary Nielsen Sec-
retary of Homeland Security all recog-
nize this—and we get to a solution. It
is not going to end everything, but it
will be a solution.
I am asking my colleagues tonight,
as this bill is being moved through the
hotline for unanimous consent—and I
thank all the Republicans who have al-
ready said they will support it. We get
my colleagues on the Democratic
side—again, there are a number of
Democratic cosponsors on this bill. The
President said he would sign it. We get
it over to the House, and we start to
get solutions as opposed to just road-
blocks.
There are just two broader issues I
want to raise. As I am indicating, this
kind of work can be a template to get-
ting to a broader solution with regard
to the partial government shutdown—
Democrats and Republicans in this
body working together, the White
House working with us, the Trump ad-
ministration working with us, and,
hopefully, the House will see the wis-
dom of this when the bill comes over to
them, and we will get a bill signed that
takes care of almost 50,000 Active-Duty
patriots—men and women—risking
their lives, right now as we speak, with
no pay. I am hopeful that is a tem-
plate.
Another broader issue that this mat-
ter actually raises—that we need to
focus on a lot more in the Senate—is a
problem I have seen in the last 4 years
during my time here; that sometimes
the Coast Guard gets short shrift rel-
ative to other members of the military.
It is wrong, and we need to work on it
together.
Why has that happened? Certainly
not because they are not as heroic and
dedicated and patriotic as the rest of
the military. I don’t think it is inten-
tional. It is more bureaucratic. The
Coast Guard falls under the Commerce
Committee. The Coast Guard falls
under the Homeland Security Sec-
retary. The Marines, the Army, the
Navy, and the Air Force are under the
Armed Services Committee and under
the Pentagon. Sometimes things just
happen, whether it is retirement pay,
whether it is the example of paying the
military, where the Coast Guard gets
treated in an unequal manner. They
shouldn’t. They shouldn’t. We need to
treat all members of the military, all
five branches, the same: pay, retire-
ment, shutdowns. Again, I don’t think
it is intentional, but it does happen.
I am the chairman of the sub-
committee in the Commerce Com-
mittee in charge of the Coast Guard. I
sit on the Armed Services Committee.
I know a lot of my colleagues, Demo-
crats and Republicans, have recognized
this is a problem. The chairman of the
Commerce Committee, the chairman of
the Armed Services Committee have. I
think we are all focused—again, bipar-
tisan—to address some of these chal-
lenges where the Coast Guard is not
treated equally among the other serv-
ices, and that is just wrong. We need to
start working on that, and I am going
to continue to focus on that issue.
The best way we can start working
on that is tonight: Fix this pay prob-
lem, which every single American
knows is inequitable, knows is not fair
to the men and women of the Coast
Guard, but we are on the verge of a so-
lution. Let’s UC this bill tonight—we
have the White House’s support—and
get it over to the House. At least we
will take care of one issue where there
is an inequality between the men and
women in the other branches of the
services and the Coast Guard, and then
we will work to fix all the others. I am
hopeful we are going to get there to-
night and hopefully will solve this
problem in the next 24 to 48 hours.
I yield the floor.

GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, it has
been an interesting start to this new
Congress 2 weeks ago today, I believe—
almost 2 weeks ago, this week. We are
in a shutdown, and then we had a vote
here a few minutes ago to disapprove of
a decision made by the administration.
A lot of people would look at that,
and they would say that is a sign of
weakness and division. Most certainly,
I don’t like this shutdown. I hope we
can figure a way out of it quickly. A
lot of people who had nothing to do
with it are being hurt. My feelings
about that are strong as well. I don’t
think what the President is requesting
is unreasonable, but the reason we
have a shutdown is because, at the end
of the day, everyone involved—no mat-
ter how long and how strongly they
disagree—is willing to live by the Con-
stitution, and the Constitution says,
the only way you can fund the govern-
ment is if the House and the Senate
pass a spending bill and the President
signs it into law.
Likewise, we had a vote a few min-
utes ago about a decision made by the
administration to delist a Russian
company after some changes were
made to the ownership structure. You
may disagree with it or agree with it,
but the bottom line is, that the reason
the vote happened is we passed a law
that said within 30 days of it being en-
acted, the Congress could act to dis-
approve. That is the way our constitu-
tional system works.
So despite our sharp disagreements,
despite our arguments, despite what
appears outwardly to the country and
many in the world as a sign of division
and weakness, the result may not be

anything we support—or maybe it is—
but at its core, let’s remind ourselves
that the reason this is happening is be-
cause everyone involved, no matter
how much they appear to dislike each
other or how much they disagree, they
are willing to live within the letter and
the law of the Constitution of the
United States of America.
VENEZUELA
Imagine an alternative for a moment.
Imagine if the President, frustrated by
Congress’s continuing unwillingness to
fund one of his priorities on border se-
curity, frustrated by a decision in Con-
gress to disapprove of a decision he
made regarding sanctions, decided not
only was he going to ignore Congress,
but he was going to stop paying them,
he was going to jail its Members, and
he was going to create an alternative
Congress, which he handpicked and
controlled.
That sounds farfetched. That sounds
clearly unconstitutional, but there are
parts of this world where those kinds of
things are happening, and one of them
is in our hemisphere. What I have just
described to you is exactly what has
happened in the nation of Venezuela
beginning as early as 2013.
What has happened there is that the
supposed President—actual dictator—
of the country, frustrated that the
democratically elected national assem-
bly would not support his initiatives to
control the country, decided to create
an alternative—what they call a con-
stituent assembly—an alternative con-
gress. They no longer pay the national
assembly members at all. They have no
staffing; they have no budget; they are
hardly allowed to meet; and several of
them have been jailed.
As part of this process of replacing
the national assembly or at least ig-
noring them and giving no force of law
to what they vote on and creating this
alternative national assembly called
the constituent assembly, completely
outside their Constitution, with no
basis in law—that entity, that orga-
nism, called for an election, a new elec-
tion for President. It was a snap elec-
tion designed to not allow the opposi-
tion to organize in time, an election in
which they control all the television
stations, in which people had to show
an ID card in order to vote, and that ID
card also happened to be the card that
got your family food and medicine—the
limited amounts people are getting—
not a fair election in any way.
The result is, last May, Maduro
‘‘wins’’ this ‘‘fraudulent’’ election, and
the first day of the term of this fraudu-
lent Presidency was last week.
Rightfully, the President of the
United States, along with leaders from
multiple other countries—including
Colombia, Brazil, Canada, and dozens
of countries around the world—have
said Maduro is an illegitimate Presi-
dent under the Constitution of Ven-
ezuela: The election you held isn’t free
and fair. The election you held was au-
thorized by an organism that is not
recognized under the Constitution. You
are not the real President. You are a
fraud, and the only reason why you are
in office is because you are threatening
to jail or kill the people who are will-
ing to raise this point against you.
The administration went further, and
they said the national assembly of
Venezuela is the only constitutionally,
democratically elected government in
the country.
The statements we have made in the
last week are entirely rooted in the
rule of law and entirely rooted in the
Venezuelan Constitution, and they are
not unilateral actions. These state-
ments have been supported by other
countries in the region, including Ven-
ezuela’s neighbors.
If, in fact, we are basing our public
policy on the Constitution of Ven-
ezuela, there is one more provision we
cannot ignore; that is, a provision in
the Constitution that says that when
there is a vacancy in the Presidency
and the Vice Presidency, the President
of Venezuela is the President of the na-
tional assembly.
We have a similar line of secession in
the United States. In the absence of
the President or the Vice President,
the Speaker of the House automati-
cally becomes the President of the
United States. They might have a
swearing-in ceremony, but by law that
absence triggers the Presidency of the
Speaker of the House—third in the
line, followed by No. 4 in line, the
President pro tempore of the Senate.
They have a similar outline in Ven-
ezuela under their Constitution. So it
stands to reason that if our policy is
that Maduro and his Vice President are
illegitimate because they were elected
in an extra-constitutional, fraudulent
election, then clearly the Presidency of
Venezuela is vacant. And if we are
rooting our support for the National
Assembly as the only constitutionally
and legitimately elected body in the
country, then we must respect the fact
that that Constitution automatically
passes the title of ‘‘President’’ to the
President of the National Assembly.
What I come to the floor today to ask
is that the administration—hopefully
in concert with Brazil and Canada and
Columbia and other countries around
the world—simply recognize what the
Venezuelan Constitution clearly lays
out. There is no President in Venezuela
right now that has been democratically
elected, and via their own Constitu-
tion, the current President of Ven-
ezuela, pending a new election, is Juan
Guaido, the President of the National
Assembly.
This is entirely rooted, as I said, in
rule of law and under the Venezuelan
Constitution. It doesn’t even require
Mr. Guaido to assume the office; it
automatically is bestowed upon him. It
is a critical thing for us to do in order
to begin to build a better future for
Venezuela, along with our partners in
the region.
I think the next actions that should
be followed after that happens is that
Mr. Guaido name a cabinet and name
leaders to run the military.
From the perspective of the United
States, since we have recognized the le-
gitimate Presidency of the National
Assembly’s President, pending a new
election, I think the time has come to
expel the Maduro-appointed Ambas-
sadors and allow the new constitu-
tional President to appoint replace-
ments.
The frozen assets of the Venezuelan
Government should be put at the dis-
posal of legitimate government so they
can use them to conduct a free and fair
election and also use them to begin to
rebuild the country.
The opportunity exists now to work
with the new President, pending the
new election, to begin laying out plans
to deliver humanitarian aid right now,
along with our partners in the region
in the world, but also to help put to-
gether a package of assistance to help
Venezuela rebuild a country decimated
by the current dictatorship.
These are bold moves, but they are
entirely rooted in the rule of law, en-
tirely justified under the Venezuelan
Constitution, and will be clear evi-
dence that we will not stand by idly as
democracy in the region is wiped out
by this growing trend around the world
of authoritarians assuming the
vestiges of democracy—holding elec-
tions that aren’t real elections, having
parliamentary bodies that aren’t real—
in essence, dressing the part of demo-
crats but behaving like dictators.
I strongly urge this administration
publicly—and I have done so pri-
vately—to move quickly to recognize
the President of the National Assembly
of Venezuela, Juan Guaido, as the in-
terim President of that country pend-
ing a transition to a new, free and fair
election, and I hope this is an action
we will take in concert with our part-
ners in the region who recognize the
exact same thing.
There is a window of opportunity
here to shine the light of freedom and
liberty through our actions, and I hope
we move expeditiously in pursuit of
that goal. And to the Venezuelan peo-
ple—that they may know that we are
standing with them, that we have been
given a concrete opportunity to defend
their aspirations for freedom and a bet-
ter future but also to defend their Con-
stitution.
To military officers in Venezuela who
swore to uphold and defend their Con-
stitution, now is the opportunity for
you to abandon the current direction of
the country and assume your responsi-
bility that you have sworn to uphold,
and that is the constitutional provi-
sions of that country.
I believe with all my heart and I have
every reason to believe without any
doubt that this administration and this
government, along with this Congress,
stand ready to work hand in hand with
the people of Venezuela to restore a
rightful democracy and empower that
country to head in the right direction.
I urge the administration to move
quickly to take the first step on our
part to facilitate that. It is, as I said,

ator from Rhode Island.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I know you are not allowed to re-
spond to me, but allow me to welcome
you to the Chair as a new Member of
the Senate.
With a new year come a lot of
changes. This month, a Democratic
majority was sworn in to the House of
Representatives. That new majority
has heard the call from Americans to
make tackling climate change one of
our top priorities, and what a change
that will make from the last Congress.
Young voters who helped propel this
change are urgently concerned about
climate change. More than three-
fourths of millennials agree on the
need for climate action. Even a major-
ity of Republican millennials agree on
the need for action in face of our cli-
mate crisis. Indeed, a former Repub-
lican Congressman just wrote about
climate change: ‘‘My party will never
earn the votes of millennials unless it
gets serious about finding solutions.’’
Of course, it is not just younger vot-
ers; polling shows that Americans of
all ages and political stripes favor pol-
icy solutions that scientists and econo-
mists say are needed to tackle climate
change. A recent survey of more than
10,000 registered voters showed that
nearly two-thirds of Americans believe
that investing in renewable energy will
create more jobs than investing in fos-
sil fuel. Among Republicans—here—52
percent of Republican voters think
that focusing on renewables will create
more jobs than fossil fuel—52 percent
to 29 percent—and that is with the non-
stop saturation, indoctrination of the
Republican Party by the fossil fuel in-
dustry, with all of its propaganda and
nonsense.
Of course, the facts bear out that re-
newable energy will create more jobs.
It is already happening. Over 3 million
Americans are employed in the renew-
able energy and energy efficiency in-
dustries, compared to just over 1 mil-
lion in fossil fuels. There is far more
job growth in the renewable sector
than in the declining, decrepit fossil
fuel industry.
Solid majorities of Americans say
they want more emphasis on renewable
energy. Seventy-one percent want
more solar, 64 percent want more wind,
and 56 percent want more hydropower.
By contrast, only 40 percent want more
natural gas, only 25 percent want more
oil, and only 18 percent want more
coal. Seventy-one percent want solar,
and 18 percent want coal. I think the
Trump administration would do well to
pay attention to those numbers—if it
were, indeed, about the numbers, any-
way.
So make the question harder. Go all
in. Ask Americans about a full transi-
tion to a 100-percent renewable energy
system, and most say that the transi-
tion to a 100-percent renewable energy
system for America will be good for
working families—better than con-
tinuing on our fossil fuel path.
If you look at what Republicans say,
by 2 to 1, Republican voters say that
going to renewables will have a posi-
tive impact on working families,
versus only 23.5 percent who say it will
have a negative impact. The rest—
‘‘don’t know’’ or ‘‘no impact either
way.’’ But the people who favor 100 per-
cent renewables as a good thing for
working families—even among Repub-
lican voters, it is 2 to 1 over fossil fuel.
When Americans are told about a
Green New Deal to reduce carbon pollu-
tion and create clean energy jobs by in-
vesting in infrastructure and renewable
energy and efficient buildings and
transportation systems, almost 70 per-
cent are supportive, and that includes
almost 60 percent of Republicans—20
percent strongly support, and 36.8 per-
cent support. So even the Green New
Deal is a winner among Republican
voters.
Ask about putting a price on carbon
pollution. Why would you want to do
that? Because right now, the costs of
carbon pollution are put on the public.
They are put on all of us. They are put
on our constituents. Polluters get
away with polluting for free, and the
rest of us pay for the added drought
and wildfire and storm damage costs.
Well, more than 60 percent of reg-
istered voters support pricing carbon
to reduce emissions. And if you look at
Republicans, a majority of Republicans
under the age of 45 also support a car-
bon price.
This new polling matches other poll-
ing that is on its way out or recently
out that shows solid support for pricing
carbon and making polluters pay for
the damage they are causing—which,
by the way, is also economics 101, but
never mind that. We are talking about
polling today.
A Monmouth University poll showed
that 64 percent of Republicans now ac-
cept climate change as a problem, and
a majority of Republicans support gov-
ernment action to combat climate
change—a majority of Republicans.
An ABC News poll showed that 81
percent of Americans support cutting
greenhouse gas emissions, two-thirds
supported a carbon tax, and 81 percent
supported tax breaks for renewable
power.
These are big, strong, national ma-
jorities in favor of the kind of action
we need and could do to stem the cli-
mate crisis.
A poll for Yale and George Mason
Universities showed that 70 percent of
registered voters, including over half of
Republicans, support reducing green-
house gas emissions regardless of what
other countries do.
This poll also found majority support
across both parties for U.S. participa-
tion in the Paris Agreement and over-
whelming support for renewal energy
among Republicans, Democrats, and
Independents.
What is more, this poll found that al-
most three-quarters of registered vot-
ers, including a majority of Repub-
licans, support setting strict limits on
carbon pollution from coal-fired power-
plants, and a majority of Republicans,
Independents, and Democrats support
imposing a revenue neutral carbon tax
on fossil fuel companies. A majority of
Republicans support imposing a rev-
enue neutral carbon tax on fossil fuel
companies.
Well, I have had a bill with Senator
SCHATZ in the last several Congresses
to do just that—charge a fee on the
polluters for their carbon emissions
and then return all the revenue raised
to the American people. Several bills
on the House side also price carbon pol-
lution, and a few even had Republican
cosponsors.
These bills went nowhere under Re-
publican leadership, notwithstanding
these numbers and notwithstanding
public support. Why? Because the fossil
fuel industry opposes them—so no
hearings, no vote, no nothing.
What did get a vote in the House last
year under Republican leadership? A
resolution condemning carbon pric-
ing—condemning the carbon pricing
that a majority of Republican voters
support—backed, of course, by the fos-
sil fuel industry. Virtually every ex-
pert, economist, and scientist who has
studied the question says that putting
a price on carbon pollution is not only
the right thing to do morally and eco-
nomically but is necessary to keep
global temperatures from climbing 2
degrees Celsius above preindustrial
norms, as the scientific consensus
makes clear we must do at a min-
imum—at a minimum. If we blow past
2 degrees, all bets are off, and the con-
sequences of climate change may be-
come irreversible. Even at 1.5 degrees,
we are taking chances, but dozens of
industry-backed front groups—this is
hard to see, but this is the usual array
of web-of-denial, phony-baloney front
groups that have been supported, fund-
ed, and created by the fossil fuel indus-
try so people don’t think it is the fossil
fuel industry committing this non-
sense. They have groups with names
such as ALEC, the Competitive Enter-
prise Institute, Americans for Tax Re-
form, Heartland Institute, and Insti-
tute for Liberty. These groups clean up
their propaganda for them.
So here come these letters. These in-
dustry-backed front groups had one im-
portant thing going for them that the
Nobel Prize-winning economists on the
other side couldn’t match, and that is
big political money and the fossil fuel
industry behind them. Groups behind

least $54 million from Big Oil and the
Koch brothers’ political network—at
least $54 million. We don’t know for
sure because of their clandestine, dark
money funding network. Likely, it is
far more.
The minimum $54 million that the
fossil fuel industry funded these groups
with may likely be far more because so
much of the fossil fuel industry’s fund-
ing is obscured through dark money
channels to hide their hand.
What did they achieve? Well, they
got a vote. Unlike the carbon pricing
bills, they got a vote on the House
floor. Speaker RYAN brought the fossil
fuel-funded resolution to a vote, and
with the Republican caucus largely a
wholly owned subsidiary of the fossil
fuel industry, the resolution passed.
There is a whole case study in cor-
ruption here, as the Founding Fathers
would define it, but the simple lesson
for today’s purposes: Money talks and
big fossil fuel money commands.
This situation stinks. The polls I just
went through and others show what
Americans want. Americans want jobs,
Americans want clean air, Americans
want a healthy climate, and Americans
want to be safe from extreme weather,
wildfires, and rising seas, and Ameri-
cans know clean energy solutions will
get them there.
Americans are ready for bipartisan
action, and before the Supreme Court’s
decision in Citizens United came along,
we had bipartisan action in the Senate
on climate. We had lots of bipartisan
action in the Senate on climate, but
with Citizens United, unlimited money
launched into our politics and things
changed, and now the strings are pulled
by Big Oil, Big Coal, and a couple of
creepy fossil fuel industry billionaires.
Special interest money has infected
almost everything we do in Congress,
and it is the flagrant fact of our non-
response to the climate crisis. The
warnings have been coming for dec-
ades—first from the scientists, then
from the economists, now from prac-
tically everywhere.
I went to the capital city of the Pre-
siding Officer’s State and was told
there that the staffing requirements
for police and fire were going to have
to change because Phoenix, AZ, was be-
coming so hot that to get people to
work outside, responding to emer-
gencies, responding to fires and so
forth, you had to build in a whole new
staffing regime because it was so hard
to work in the new levels of heat that
the city of Phoenix is experiencing.
You have to be able to rotate people
much faster through crime scenes and
through fire scenes and you had to
have other people willing to stand by
and cool them off after they were ex-
posed to superheating.
So it is everywhere now. If you live
on the coast, it is sea level; if you live
out West, it is wildfires, and it includes
Republican voters and particularly
younger Republican voters.
Remember what the recently de-
parted Republican Member of Congress
said: ‘‘My party will never earn the
votes of millennials unless it gets seri-
ous about finding solutions.’’
Well, clean energy is a solution. The
fact of all this Republican voter sup-
port on the one hand is a sign of hope
for the new year—of hope that elected
Republicans will hear their voters and
will take action and support the clean
energy solutions that can avert the cli-
mate crisis. At the same time, the vot-
ers on the Republican side who are say-
ing what they want are also being ig-
nored. Therefore, these numbers are
equally telling of the secretive polit-
ical forces at work in Congress to bot-
tle us up and to prevent what even Re-
publican voters want.
There is a rot in our politics, and our
failure on climate change is a telling
indicator of that rot. The whole world
is watching. America is supposed to be
‘‘a City upon a Hill,’’ an example for
the world. They don’t stop looking
when we are a bad example. We have to
get serious about this. Time is running
out. It is time to wake up, and it is
time to clean up.
With that, I yield the floor.

or member issuing the subpoenas. Each sub-
poena shall have attached thereto a copy of
S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress, and a copy

RULE 8. PROCEDURES RELATED TO THE TAKING
OF TESTIMONY
8.1. Notice.—Witnesses required to appear
before the Committee shall be given reason-
able notice and all witnesses shall be fur-
nished a copy of these Rules.
8.2. Oath or Affirmation.—At the direction
of the Chairman or Vice Chairman, testi-
mony of witnesses may be given under oath
or affirmation which may be administered
by any member of the Committee.
8.3. Questioning.—Committee questioning
of witnesses shall be conducted by members
of the Committee and such Committee staff
as are authorized by the Chairman, Vice
Chairman, or the presiding member.
8.4. Counsel for the Witness.—(a) Gen-
erally. Any witness may be accompanied by
counsel, subject to the requirement of para-
graph (b).
(b) Counsel Clearances Required. In the
event that a meeting of the Committee has
been closed because the subject matter was
classified in nature, counsel accompanying a
witness before the Committee must possess
the requisite security clearance and provide
proof of such clearance to the Committee at
least 24 hours prior to the meeting at which
the counsel intends to be present. A witness
who is unable to obtain counsel may inform
the Committee of such fact. If the witness
informs the Committee of this fact at least
24 hours prior to his or her appearance before
the Committee, the Committee shall then
endeavor to obtain voluntary counsel for the
witness. Failure to obtain such counsel will
not excuse the witness from appearing and
testifying.
(c) Conduct of Counsel for the Witness.
Counsel for witnesses appearing before the
Committee shall conduct themselves in an
ethical and professional manner at all times
in their dealings with the Committee. Fail-
ure to do so shall, upon a finding to that ef-
fect by a majority of the members present,
subject such counsel to disciplinary action
which may include warning, censure, re-
moval, or a recommendation of contempt
proceedings.
(d) Role of Counsel for Witness. There shall
be no direct or cross-examination by counsel
for the witness. However, counsel for the
witness may submit any question in writing
to the Committee and request the Com-
mittee to propound such question to the
counsel’s client or to any other witness. The
counsel for the witness also may suggest the
presentation of other evidence or the calling
of other witnesses. The Committee may use
or dispose of such questions or suggestions
as it deems appropriate.
8.5. Statements by Witnesses.—Witnesses
may make brief and relevant statements at
the beginning and conclusion of their testi-
mony. Such statements shall not exceed a
reasonable period of time as determined by
the Chairman, or other presiding members.
Any witness required or desiring to make a
prepared or written statement for the record
of the proceedings shall file a paper and elec-
tronic copy with the Clerk of the Committee,
and insofar as practicable and consistent
with the notice given, shall do so at least 48
hours in advance of his or her appearance be-
fore the Committee, unless the Chairman
and Vice Chairman determine there is good
cause for noncompliance with the 48 hours
requirement.
8.6. Objections and Rulings.—Any objection
raised by a witness or counsel shall be ruled
upon by the Chairman or other presiding
member, and such ruling shall be the ruling
of the Committee unless a majority of the
Committee present overrules the ruling of
the chair.
8.7. Inspection and Correction.—All wit-
nesses testifying before the Committee shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to inspect,
in the office of the Committee, the tran-
script of their testimony to determine
whether such testimony was correctly tran-
scribed. The witness may be accompanied by
counsel. Any corrections the witness desires
to make in the transcript shall be submitted
in writing to the Committee within five days
from the date when the transcript was made
available to the witness. Corrections shall be
limited to grammar and minor editing, and
may not be made to change the substance of
the testimony. Any questions arising with
respect to such corrections shall be decided
by the Chairman. Upon request, the Com-
mittee may provide to a witness those parts
of testimony given by that witness in execu-
tive session which are subsequently quoted
or made part of a public record, at the ex-
pense of the witness.
8.8. Requests To Testify.—The Committee
will consider requests to testify on any mat-
ter or measure pending before the Com-
mittee. A person who believes that testi-
mony or other evidence presented at a public
hearing, or any comment made by a Com-
mittee member or a member of the Com-
mittee staff, may tend to affect adversely
that person’s reputation, may request in
writing to appear personally before the Com-
mittee to testify or may file a sworn state-
ment of facts relevant to the testimony, evi-
dence, or comment, or may submit to the
Chairman proposed questions in writing for
the questioning of other witnesses. The Com-
mittee shall take such action as it deems ap-
propriate.
8.9. Contempt Procedures.—No rec-
ommendation that a person be cited for con-
tempt of Congress or that a subpoena be oth-
erwise enforced shall be forwarded to the
Senate unless and until the Committee has,
upon notice to all its members, met and con-
sidered the recommendation, afforded the
person an opportunity to address such con-
tempt recommendation or subpoena enforce-
ment proceeding either in writing or in per-
son, and agreed by majority vote of the Com-
mittee to forward such recommendation to
the Senate.
8.10. Release of Name of Witness.—Unless
authorized by the Chairman, the name of
any witness scheduled to be heard by the
Committee shall not be released prior to, or
after, appearing before the Committee. Upon
authorization by the Chairman to release the
name of a witness under this paragraph, the
Vice Chairman shall be notified of such au-
thorization as soon as practicable thereafter.
No name of any witness shall be released if
such release would disclose classified infor-
mation, unless authorized under Section 8 of
S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress or Rule 9.7.
RULE 9. PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING CLASSIFIED
OR COMMITTEE SENSITIVE MATERIAL
9.1. Committee staff offices shall operate
under strict security procedures adminis-
tered by the Committee Security Director

sons shall identify themselves and provide
identification as requested.
9.2. Classified documents and material
shall be stored in authorized security con-
tainers located within the Committee’s Sen-
sitive Compartmented Information Facility
(SCIF). Copying, duplicating, or removing
from the Committee offices of such docu-
ments and other materials is strictly prohib-
ited except as is necessary for the conduct of
Committee business, and as provided by
these Rules. All classified documents or ma-
terials removed from the Committee offices
for such authorized purposes must be re-
turned to the Committee’s SCIF for over-
night storage.
9.3. ‘‘Committee sensitive’’ means informa-
tion or material that pertains to the con-
fidential business or proceedings of the Se-
lect Committee on Intelligence, within the
meaning of paragraph 5 of Rule XXIX of the
Standing Rules of the Senate, and is: (1) in
the possession or under the control of the
Committee; (2) discussed or presented in an
executive session of the Committee; (3) the
work product of a Committee member or
staff member; (4) properly identified or
marked by a Committee member or staff
member who authored the document; or (5)
designated as such by the Chairman and Vice
Chairman (or by the Staff Director and Mi-
nority Staff Director acting on their behalf).
Committee sensitive documents and mate-
rials that are classified shall be handled in
the same manner as classified documents
and material in Rule 9.2. Unclassified com-
mittee sensitive documents and materials
shall be stored in a manner to protect
against unauthorized disclosure.
9.4. Each member of the Committee shall
at all times have access to all papers and
other material received from any source.
The Staff Director shall be responsible for
the maintenance, under appropriate security
procedures, of a document control and ac-
countability registry which will number and
identify all classified papers and other clas-
sified materials in the possession of the
Committee, and such registry shall be avail-
able to any member of the Committee.
9.5. Whenever the Select Committee on In-
telligence makes classified material avail-
able to any other committee of the Senate or
to any member of the Senate not a member
of the Committee, such material shall be ac-
companied by a verbal or written notice to
the recipients advising of their responsi-
bility to protect such materials pursuant to
section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress.
The Security Director of the Committee
shall ensure that such notice is provided and
shall maintain a written record identifying
the particular information transmitted and
the committee or members of the Senate re-
ceiving such information.
9.6. Access to classified information sup-
plied to the Committee shall be limited to
those Committee staff members with appro-
priate security clearance and a need-to-
know, as determined by the Committee, and,
under the Committee’s direction, the Staff
Director and Minority Staff Director.
9.7. No member of the Committee or of the
Committee staff shall disclose, in whole or in
part or by way of summary, the contents of
any classified or committee sensitive papers,
materials, briefings, testimony, or other in-
formation received by, or in the possession
of, the Committee to any other person, ex-
cept as specified in this rule. Committee
members and staff do not need prior approval
to disclose classified or committee sensitive
information to persons in the Executive
branch, the members and staff of the House
Permanent Select Committee on Intel-
ligence, and the members and staff of the
Senate, provided that the following condi-
tions are met: (1) for classified information,
the recipients of the information must pos-
sess appropriate security clearances (or have
access to the information by virtue of their
office); (2) for all information, the recipients
of the information must have a need-to-know
such information for an official govern-
mental purpose; and (3) for all information,
the Committee members and staff who pro-
vide the information must be engaged in the
routine performance of Committee legisla-
tive or oversight duties. Otherwise, classified
and committee sensitive information may
only be disclosed to persons outside the Com-
mittee (to include any congressional com-
mittee, Member of Congress, congressional
staff, or specified non-governmental persons
who support intelligence activities) with the
prior approval of the Chairman and Vice
Chairman of the Committee, or the Staff Di-
rector and Minority Staff Director acting on
their behalf, consistent with the require-
ments that classified information may only
be disclosed to persons with appropriate se-
curity clearances and a need-to-know such
information for an official governmental
purpose. Public disclosure of classified infor-
mation in the possession of the Committee
may only be authorized in accordance with
Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress.
9.8. Failure to abide by Rule 9.7 shall con-
stitute grounds for referral to the Select
Committee on Ethics pursuant to Section 8
of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress. Prior to
a referral to the Select Committee on Ethics
pursuant to Section 8 of S. Res. 400, the
Chairman and Vice Chairman shall notify
the Majority Leader and Minority Leader.
9.9. Before the Committee makes any deci-
sion regarding the disposition of any testi-
mony, papers, or other materials presented
to it, the Committee members shall have a
reasonable opportunity to examine all perti-
nent testimony, papers, and other materials
that have been obtained by the members of
the Committee or the Committee staff.
9.10. Attendance of persons outside the
Committee at closed meetings of the Com-
mittee shall be kept at a minimum and shall
be limited to persons with appropriate secu-
rity clearance and a need-to-know the infor-
mation under consideration for the execu-
tion of their official duties. The Security Di-
rector of the Committee may require that
notes taken at such meetings by any person
in attendance shall be returned to the secure
storage area in the Committee’s offices at
the conclusion of such meetings, and may be
made available to the department, agency,
office, committee, or entity concerned only
in accordance with the security procedures
of the Committee.
9.11 Attendance of agencies or entities that
were not formally invited to a closed pro-
ceeding of the Committee shall not be admit-
ted to the closed meeting except upon ad-
vance permission from the Chairman and
Vice Chairman, or by the Staff Director and
Minority Staff Director acting on their be-
half.

mittee staff includes employees of the Com-
mittee, consultants to the Committee, or
any other person engaged by contract or oth-
erwise to perform services for or at the re-
quest of the Committee. To the maximum

tive of both or either be confirmed by a ma-
jority vote of the Committee. After approval
or confirmation, the Chairman shall certify
Committee staff appointments to the Finan-
cial Clerk of the Senate in writing. No Com-
mittee staff shall be given access to any
classified information or regular access to
the Committee offices until such Committee
staff has received an appropriate security
clearance as described in Section 6 of S. Res.
400 of the 94th Congress.

Committee. The duties of the Committee
staff shall be performed, and Committee
staff personnel affairs and day-to-day oper-
ations, including security and control of
classified documents and material, shall be
administered under the direct supervision
and control of the Staff Director. All Com-
mittee staff shall work exclusively on intel-
ligence oversight issues for the Committee.

sidered by the Committee and the Senate.
10.5. The members of the Committee staff
shall not discuss either the substance or pro-
cedure of the work of the Committee with
any person not a member of the Committee
or the Committee staff for any purpose or in
connection with any proceeding, judicial or
otherwise, either during their tenure as a
member of the Committee staff or at any
time thereafter, except as directed by the
Committee in accordance with Section 8 of
S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress and the pro-
visions of these rules, or in the event of the
termination of the Committee, in such a
manner as may be determined by the Senate.
The Chairman may authorize the Staff Di-
rector and the Staff Director’s designee, and
the Vice Chairman may authorize the Minor-
ity Staff Director and the Minority Staff Di-
rector’s designee, to communicate with the
media in a manner that does not divulge
classified or committee sensitive informa-
tion.
10.6. No member of the Committee staff
shall be employed by the Committee unless
and until such a member of the Committee

ployment, to abide by the conditions of the

Select Committee on Intelligence, pursuant
to Section 6 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Con-
gress, and to abide by the Committee’s code
of conduct.

the Committee, each member of the Com-
mittee staff must agree in writing to notify
the Committee of any request for testimony,
either during service as a member of the
Committee staff or at any time thereafter
with respect to information obtained by vir-
tue of employment as a member of the Com-
mittee staff. Such information shall not be
disclosed in response to such requests, except
as directed by the Committee in accordance
with Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Con-
gress and the provisions of these rules or, in
the event of the termination of the Com-
mittee, in such manner as may be deter-
mined by the Senate.

consider action to be taken in the case of
any member of the Committee staff who fails
to conform to any of these Rules. Such dis-
ciplinary action may include, but shall not

ed auditing standards.
10.10. The workplace of the Committee
shall be free from illegal use, possession,
sale, or distribution of controlled substances
by its employees. Any violation of such pol-
icy by any member of the Committee staff
shall be grounds for termination of employ-
ment. Further, any illegal use of controlled
substances by a member of the Committee
staff, within the workplace or otherwise,
shall result in reconsideration of the secu-
rity clearance of any such staff member and
may constitute grounds for termination of
employment with the Committee.
10.11. All personnel actions affecting the

mittee members in preparation for such

ered during the meeting. Such briefing shall,
at the request of a member, include a list of
all pertinent papers and other materials that

meeting.
11.2. The Staff Director and/or Minority

ferred bill and its annexes, but may propose
changes or alterations to the same in the
form of amendments.

strued as prohibiting or otherwise restrict-
ing the authority of any other committee to
study and review any intelligence activity to
the extent that such activity directly affects
a matter otherwise within the jurisdiction of
such committee.
(d) Nothing in this resolution shall be con-
strued as amending, limiting, or otherwise
changing the authority of any standing com-

prompt access to the product of the intel-
ligence activities of any department or agen-
cy of the Government relevant to a matter
otherwise within the jurisdiction of such
committee.
SEC. 4. (a) The select committee, for the
purposes of accountability to the Senate,
shall make regular and periodic, but not less
than quarterly, reports to the Senate on the
nature and extent of the intelligence activi-
ties of the various departments and agencies
of the United States. Such committee shall
promptly call to the attention of the Senate
or to any other appropriate committee or

quiring the attention of the Senate or such
other committee or committees. In making
such report, the select committee shall pro-
ceed in a manner consistent with section
8(c)(2) to protect national security.
(b) The select committee shall obtain an
annual report from the Director of National
Intelligence, the Director of the Central In-
telligence Agency, the Secretary of Defense,
the Secretary of State, and the Director of

ties of the agency or department concerned
and the intelligence activities of foreign
countries directed at the United States or its

port may be made available to the public at
the discretion of the select committee. Noth-
ing herein shall be construed as requiring
the public disclosure in such reports of the
names of individuals engaged in intelligence
activities for the United States or the di-
vulging of intelligence methods employed or
the sources of information on which such re-
ports are based or the amount of funds au-
thorized to be appropriated for intelligence
activities.
(c) On or before March 15 of each year, the
select committee shall submit to the Com-
mittee on the Budget of the Senate the views
and estimates described in section 301(c) of

ing matters within the jurisdiction of the se-
lect committee.
SEC. 5. (a) For the purposes of this resolu-
tion, the select committee is authorized in
its discretion (1) to make investigations into
any matter within its jurisdiction, (2) to
make expenditures from the contingent fund
of the Senate, (3) to employ personnel, (4) to
hold hearings, (5) to sit and act at any time
or place during the sessions, recesses, and
adjourned periods of the Senate, (6) to re-
quire, by subpoena or otherwise, the attend-
ance of witnesses and the production of cor-
respondence, books, papers, and documents,
(7) to take depositions and other testimony,
(8) to procure the service of individual con-
sultants or organizations thereof, in accord-
ance with the provisions of section 202(i) of
the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946,
and (9) with the prior consent of the govern-
ment department or agency concerned and
the Committee on Rules and Administration,
to use on a reimbursable basis the services of
personnel of any such department or agency.
(b) The chairman of the select committee
or any member thereof may administer
oaths to witnesses.
(c) Subpoenas authorized by the select
committee may be issued over the signature
of the chairman, the vice chairman or any

person designated by the chairman or any
member signing the subpoenas.
SEC. 6. No employee of the select com-
mittee or any person engaged by contract or
otherwise to perform services for or at the
request of such committee shall be given ac-
cess to any classified information by such
committee unless such employee or person
has (1) agreed in writing and under oath to
be bound by the rules of the Senate (includ-
ing the jurisdiction of the Select Committee
on Ethics) and of such committee as to the
security of such information during and
after the period of his employment or con-
tractual agreement with such committee;
and (2) received an appropriate security
clearance as determined by such committee
in consultation with the Director of National
Intelligence. The type of security clearance
to be required in the case of any such em-
ployee or person shall, within the determina-
tion of such committee in consultation with
the Director of National Intelligence, be
commensurate with the sensitivity of the
classified information to which such em-
ployee or person will be given access by such
committee.
SEC. 7. The select committee shall formu-
late and carry out such rules and procedures
as it deems necessary to prevent the disclo-
sure, without the consent of the person or
persons concerned, of information in the pos-
session of such committee which unduly in-
fringes upon the privacy or which violates
the constitutional rights of such person or
persons. Nothing herein shall be construed to
prevent such committee from publicly dis-
closing any such information in any case in
which such committee determines the na-
tional interest in the disclosure of such in-
formation clearly outweighs any infringe-
ment on the privacy of any person or per-
sons.
SEC. 8. (a) The select committee may, sub-
ject to the provisions of this section, disclose
publicly any information in the possession of
such committee after a determination by
such committee that the public interest
would be served by such disclosure. When-
ever committee action is required to disclose
any information under this section, the com-
mittee shall meet to vote on the matter
within five days after any member of the
committee requests such a vote. No member
of the select committee shall disclose any in-
formation, the disclosure of which requires a
committee vote, prior to a vote by the com-
mittee on the question of the disclosure of
such information or after such vote except in
accordance with this section.
(b)(1) In any case in which the select com-
mittee votes to disclose publicly any infor-
mation which has been classified under es-
tablished security procedures, which has
been submitted to it by the Executive
branch, and which the Executive branch re-
quests be kept secret, such committee
shall—
(A) first, notify the Majority Leader and
Minority Leader of the Senate of such vote;
and
(B) second, consult with the Majority
Leader and Minority Leader before notifying
the President of such vote.
(2) The select committee may disclose pub-
licly such information after the expiration of
a five-day period following the day on which
notice of such vote is transmitted to the Ma-
jority Leader and the Minority Leader and
the President, unless, prior to the expiration
of such five-day period, the President, per-
sonally in writing, notifies the committee
that he objects to the disclosure of such in-
formation, provides his reasons therefore,
and certifies that the threat to the national
interest of the United States posed by such
disclosure is of such gravity that it out-
weighs any public interest in the disclosure.
(3) If the President, personally, in writing,
notifies the Majority Leader and Minority
Leader of the Senate and the select Com-
mittee of his objections to the disclosure of
such information as provided in paragraph
(2), the Majority Leader and Minority Leader
jointly or the select Committee, by majority
vote, may refer the question of the disclo-
sure of such information to the Senate for
consideration.
(4) Whenever the select committee votes to
refer the question of disclosure of any infor-
mation to the Senate under paragraph (3),
the Chairman shall not later than the first
day on which the Senate is in session fol-
lowing the day on which the vote occurs, re-
port the matter to the Senate for its consid-
eration.
(5) One hour after the Senate convenes on
the fourth day on which the Senate is in ses-
sion following the day on which any such
matter is reported to the Senate, or at such
earlier time as the majority leader and the
minority leader of the Senate jointly agree
upon in accordance with paragraph 5 of rule
XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate,
the Senate shall go into closed session and
the matter shall be the pending business. In
considering the matter in closed session the
Senate may—
(A) approve the public disclosure of all or
any portion of the information in question,
in which case the committee shall publicly
disclose the information ordered to be dis-
closed,
(B) disapprove the public disclosure of all
or any portion of the information in ques-
tion, in which case the committee shall not
publicly disclose the information ordered not
to be disclosed, or
(C) refer all or any portion of the matter
back to the committee, in which case the
committee shall make the final determina-
tion with respect to the public disclosure of
the information in question.

Upon conclusion of the consideration of
such matter in closed session, which may not

day on which such matter was reported to
the Senate, or the close of the fifth day fol-
lowing the day agreed upon jointly by the
majority and minority leaders in accordance
with paragraph 5 of rule XVII of the Stand-
ing Rules of the Senate (whichever the case
may be), the Senate shall immediately vote
on the disposition of such matter in open
session, without debate, and without divulg-
ing the information with respect to which
the vote is being taken. The Senate shall
vote to dispose of such matter by one or
more of the means specified in clauses (A),

consistent with that right.
(c)(1) No information in the possession of
the select committee relating to the lawful
intelligence activities of any department or
agency of the United States which has been
classified under established security proce-
dures and which the select committee, pur-
suant to subsection (a) or (b) of this section,

be made available to any person by a Mem-
ber, officer, or employee of the Senate except

regulations as the committee shall prescribe
to protect the confidentiality of such infor-
mation, make any information described in

Whenever the select committee makes such
information available, the committee shall
keep a written record showing, in the case of
any particular information, which com-
mittee or which Members of the Senate re-
ceived such information. No Member of the
Senate who, and no committee which, re-
ceives any information under this sub-
section, shall disclose such information ex-
cept in a closed session of the Senate.
(d) It shall be the duty of the Select Com-
mittee on Ethics to investigate any unau-
thorized disclosure of intelligence informa-
tion by a Member, officer or employee of the

tion which it finds to be substantiated.
(e) Upon the request of any person who is
subject to any such investigation, the Select
Committee on Ethics shall release to such
individual at the conclusion of its investiga-
tion a summary of its investigation together
with its findings. If, at the conclusion of its
investigation, the Select Committee on Eth-
ics determines that there has been a signifi-
cant breach of confidentiality or unauthor-
ized disclosure by a Member, officer, or em-
ployee of the Senate, it shall report its find-
ings to the Senate and recommend appro-
priate action such as censure, removal from

the Senate, in the case of a Member, or re-
moval from office or employment or punish-
ment for contempt, in the case of an officer
or employee.

President, designated by the President to
serve as a liaison to such committee, to at-
tend any closed meeting of such committee.

appropriate conditions established by it,
shall be transferred to the select committee.
SEC. 11. (a) It is the sense of the Senate
that the head of each department and agency
of the United States should keep the select
committee fully and currently informed with
respect to intelligence activities, including
any significant anticipated activities, which
are the responsibility of or engaged in by
such department or agency: Provided, That
this does not constitute a condition prece-
dent to the implementation of any such an-
ticipated intelligence activity.
(b) It is the sense of the Senate that the
head of any department or agency of the
United States involved in any intelligence
activities should furnish any information or

ever requested by the select committee with
respect to any matter within such commit-
tee’s jurisdiction.
(c) It is the sense of the Senate that each
department and agency of the United States
should report immediately upon discovery to
the select committee any and all intel-
ligence activities which constitute viola-
tions of the constitutional rights of any per-
son, violations of law, or violations of Execu-
tive orders, Presidential directives, or de-
partmental or agency rules or regulations;

report to such committee what actions have
been taken or are expected to be taken by
the departments or agencies with respect to
such violations.
SEC. 12. Subject to the Standing Rules of
the Senate, no funds shall be appropriated
for any fiscal year beginning after Sep-
tember 30, 1976, with the exception of a con-
tinuing bill or resolution, or amendment
thereto, or conference report thereon, to, or
for use of, any department or agency of the

spect to each such matter, all relevant as-
pects of the effectiveness of planning, gath-
ering, use, security, and dissemination of in-
telligence:

ties of United States foreign intelligence
agencies and means for integrating more
closely analytical intelligence and policy

Senate rule or procedure, or any Executive

tection of intelligence secrets and provide
for disclosure of information for which there
is no compelling reason for secrecy;
(6) the desirability of establishing a stand-
ing committee of the Senate on intelligence
activities;
(7) the desirability of establishing a joint
committee of the Senate and the House of
Representatives on intelligence activities in
lieu of having separate committees in each
House of Congress, or of establishing proce-
dures under which separate committees on
intelligence activities of the two Houses of
Congress would receive joint briefings from
the intelligence agencies and coordinate
their policies with respect to the safe-
guarding of sensitive intelligence informa-
tion;
(8) the authorization of funds for the intel-
ligence activities of the Government and
whether disclosure of any of the amounts of
such funds is in the public interest; and

definitions for terms to be used in policies or
guidelines which may be adopted by the ex-
ecutive or legislative branches to govern,
clarify, and strengthen the operation of in-
telligence activities.

cretion, omit from the special study required

fourth Congress.

TRIBUTE TO DR. CHI WANG
Mr. RISCH. Madam President, today
I wish to honor the long and distin-
guished career of Chi Wang, Ph.D. The
year 2018 marked the 90th anniversary
of the creation of the Chinese Section
at the U.S. Library of Congress in 1928.
Dr. Wang spent nearly 50 years work-
ing at the Library of Congress, ulti-
mately serving as the head of the Chi-
nese and Korean section until his re-
tirement in 2004.
Dr. Chi Wang came to the United
States from China as a high school stu-
dent in 1949. He completed his under-
graduate and graduate degrees in the
Washington, DC, area, ultimately earn-
ing a Ph.D. in American diplomatic
history from Georgetown University in

1969. He also began pursuing his own
American dream by becoming a U.S.
citizen, getting married, starting a
family and starting a career at the Li-
brary of Congress.
Dr. Wang worked for 3 years at the
State Department’s Foreign Service In-
stitute before starting at the U.S. Li-
brary of Congress. He served in several
positions during his 47-year career at
the Library and reached the position of
head of the Chinese and Korean section
in 1975, which he held until he retired.
During his tenure, he expanded the li-
brary’s Chinese collection from 300,000
volumes to more than 1 million. Under
his guidance, the Library of Congress
became a top resource for the study of
China in the United States. Dr. Wang
met with countless U.S. Representa-
tives, Senators, officials, and aca-
demics to help them effectively use the
Library resources.
After President Nixon traveled to
China in 1972, Dr. Wang embarked on a
trip to China in his role at the Library
of Congress to promote library and
educational exchanges. The trip was a
great success, leading to future ex-
changes, large book acquisitions, and
an increase in mutual understanding
between the U.S. and China during a
very delicate time when the two coun-
tries were only just beginning to estab-
lish ties.
Although the Library of Congress
Chinese section was abolished and its
collection integrated into the larger
Asian division, the legacy of the Chi-
nese collection and the contributions
Dr. Wang made to develop this impor-
tant resource still remains. His efforts
over the years have helped deepen the
U.S. understanding of China, some-
thing that is especially necessary
today. Professor Wang continues to
dedicate his time to improving U.S.-
China mutual understanding as the co-
founder and president of the Wash-
ington, DC-based nonprofit, the U.S.-
China Policy Foundation. He also con-
tributes his own scholarship in the
field, having published multiple books
and articles on U.S.-China relations.
Dr. Wang still remembers fondly his
decades working at the Library of Con-
gress. What started simply as a job
turned into a career and lifelong pas-
sion. He especially enjoyed the times
he met with various Members of Con-
gress.
As we, again, face a challenging time
in U.S.-China relations, the resources
and information available in the Li-
brary of Congress can help in providing
increasingly useful information in un-
derstanding the complex and ever-
changing U.S.-China relationship.

TRIBUTE TO PATRICK NEWBOLD
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President,
today I wish to pay tribute to Mr. Pat-
rick Newbold for his exemplary dedica-
tion to duty and service as an Army
Congressional Fellow and Congres-
sional Budget Liaison for the Assistant
Secretary of the Army, Financial Man-
agement and Comptroller. Mr. Newbold
is transitioning from his present as-
signment to continue his selfless serv-
ice with the U.S. Corps of Engineers.
A native of Florida, Mr. Newbold
joined the Department of Army in 2004
as an Army Materiel Command Fellow
upon graduation from Bethune-
Cookman University with a bachelor’s
degree in computer information sys-
tems. He also holds a masters of busi-
ness administration from Texas A&M-
Texarkana and a master’s of profes-
sional studies in legislative affairs
from the George Washington Univer-
sity.
Mr. Newbold has served in a broad
range of assignments during his 15-year
Army career. His assignments took
him to the most strategic locations re-
sponsible for modernizing, equipping,
and empowering our Army soldiers to
fight and win wars; Red River Army
Depot, Texarkana, TX; Redstone Arse-
nal, AL; the Pentagon; and the head-
quarters of the United States Corps of
Engineers, Washington, DC. He has
held many positions, thriving in super-
visory positions hallmarked by his
servant leadership.
In 2018, I had the privilege of working
with Mr. Newbold in my capacity as
the chairman of the Senate Appropria-
tions Committee Subcommittee on
Military Construction, Veterans Af-
fairs, and Related Agencies. Mr. New-
bold worked tirelessly with Members of
Congress and their staffs to articulate
the Army’s budget positions to the ap-
propriations committees. His profes-
sionalism, diligence and commitment
to the mission are unmatched, and his
work both as a fellow for Congressman
SANFORD BISHOP and as a budget liai-
son effectively represented the U.S.
Army and the Department of Defense
to the U.S. Congress.
Throughout his career, Mr. Newbold
has made positive impacts on the lives
of soldiers, peers, and superiors. Our
country has benefited tremendously
from his extraordinary leadership,
judgment, and passion. I join my col-
leagues today in honoring his dedica-
tion to our Nation and invaluable serv-
ice to the U.S. Congress as an Army
Congressional Liaison.
It was a genuine pleasure to have
worked with Mr. Patrick Newbold over
the last year. On behalf of a grateful
nation, I join my colleagues today in
recognizing and commending Patrick
for his service to our country, and we
wish him all the best as he continues
his service in the U.S. Army.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO JEFFREY WILEY
∑ Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President,
today I wish to congratulate Ascension
Parish Sheriff Jeffrey Wiley on an ex-
ceptional career and to thank him for
his service to the people of Louisiana.
Sheriff Wiley has served Louisiana
honorably, putting his life on the line
for the protection and safety of his
community for many years.
Sheriff Wiley is a Marine Corps vet-
eran and began his law enforcement ca-
reer while attending advanced military
police training at Fort Gordon in Geor-
gia. He joined the Ascension Parish
Sheriff’s Department in 1974 as a patrol
officer and was quickly promoted to
the detective division in 1975, where he
specialized in juvenile justice.
It was during this time that Sheriff
Wiley helped organize several initia-
tives, including the Junior Deputy Pro-
gram and the Sheriffs Young Adult
League. He would later go on to serve
on the Ascension Parish School Board,
where he helped establish numerous
programs, such as the Substance Abuse
Education Program and the placement
of substance abuse counselors in the
schools.
In 1988, he returned to the Ascension
Parish Sheriff’s Department and was
appointed chief criminal deputy. He
spearheaded the department’s first full-
time narcotics division and the imple-
mentation of the D.A.R.E. program.
After being elected sheriff, he grew the
patrol/traffic force by 40 percent, in-
creased police salaries, and put more
officers on the street. His first term
was so successful that he became the
first sheriff in the history of Ascension
Parish to be reelected without opposi-
tion. In 2009, he was inducted into the
Louisiana Justice Hall of Fame.
It is because of his long list of accom-
plishments and good deeds that we
honor Sheriff Wiley. We thank him for
his commitment to the people of As-
cension Parish and to the people of our
State. Our communities are safer be-
cause of his dedication to the rule of
law. Thank you, Sheriff Wiley, for 22
years in office and for a lifetime of
service to Ascension Parish and to
Louisiana.∑

TRIBUTE TO SUSAN MCVEY
∑ Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I
would like to offer my congratulations
to Susan McVey, a fellow Oklahoman,
on her exemplary service to the State
of Oklahoma as a dedicated librarian
for the past 32 years.
Ms. McVey’s distinguished and hon-
orable record of leadership within the
Oklahoma Department of Libraries is a
model for future generations. Her ef-
fort to bring access to online reference
and information resources for all Okla-
homa libraries and schools continues
to impress. Additionally, thousands of
Oklahomans have been granted access
to library services through her work to
reform the administration of State aid
grants to public libraries. I am con-
fident these efforts will reap benefits
for generations.
Ms. McVey’s legacy will be an inspi-
ration for many in the years ahead,
and I am proud to call her a fellow
Oklahoman. Again, congratulations to
her on her well-deserved retirement,
and I thank her for her commitment to
the people of Oklahoma.∑

S216 January 15, 2019
TRIBUTE TO AL HODGE
∑ Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President,
today I am honored to recognize in the
RECORD Albert M. Hodge, Jr., of Rome,
GA.
Al Hodge is an economic develop-
ment leader whom I have known for
more than three decades, dating back
to his work as chief executive officer of
the Charleston Metro Chamber of Com-
merce in South Carolina in the 1980s.
We have worked together in business,
when I was in the State legislature and
chairman of the State board of edu-
cation, and still today in our current
roles.
Al is a fellow University of Georgia
bulldog, who led the Charleston cham-
ber for 8 years, the Augusta chamber in
Georgia for 8 years, and now the Rome
Floyd Chamber of Commerce in north-
west Georgia for what will be 21 years
when he retires from the chamber busi-
ness this April.
Al is not one to take credit, but his
professional accomplishments tell a lot
of his story not only in these commu-
nities, but also across multiple States
and even internationally.
Al is the current vice chair of the
Japan America Society of Georgia and,
along with me, a member of the Soci-
ety of International Business Fellows.
He graduated from Leadership Georgia
a few years after me, and he has always
remained active with the organization.
Al also served as a member and as vice
chair of the Georgia Board of Edu-
cation and multiple other education-fo-
cused boards. He is a past chairman
and a current board member of the
Georgia Department of Community Af-
fairs. Al has also served as chair of
Georgia’s economic development pro-
fessional association, the State’s
chamber of commerce professional as-
sociation, and he has taught economic
development at the U.S. Army War
College, internationally with our alma
mater, and other organizations.
Al is an expert in his field. He under-
stands the countless factors that play
into successful economic development,
he builds coalitions to mount success-
ful campaigns, and his work has paid
off time and again.
Rome is a great community, with
many leaders and good friends of mine,
but in large part thanks to Al’s per-
sonal investment of time and energy
into his role, the community has
gained more than $1.2 billion in direct
investments by primary employers and
the creation and retention of over 7,000
new primary jobs, not counting com-
mercial, service, and other jobs, during
his time there.
Al was an instrumental member of
the coalition that built State Mutual
Stadium and brought the Braves orga-
nization’s Class-A ball club to the com-
munity in 2003, the Rome Braves.
Thanks to his leadership, the commu-
nity passed not only the Special Pur-
pose Local Option Sales Tax—
SPLOST—but also more of these initia-
tives over the years to benefit the com-
munity’s schools, roads, airport and
countless other services. Most re-
cently, he guided development of the
Rome Tennis Center at Berry College,
the Nation’s largest single-surface fa-
cility, with 60 courts across 30 acres.
While Al has led the chamber, the
community has seen the location of
major headquarters and manufacturing
investments, including Pirelli Tire
North America, Suzuki Manufacturing
of America, Neaton Auto Products
Manufacturing, and a major Lowe’s
distribution center.
In addition to my visits to Rome and
seeing him in the State, I have spent
time with Al and the Rome chamber at
least once a year in Washington, and I
have spent the last 15 years working
with his daughter as a member of my
staff. Of all his professional accom-
plishments, it is Al’s family, friends,
and colleagues whom he truly cher-
ishes and champions.
Al is a great guy, and I want to wish
Al and his talented wife Cheryl Riner
Hodge—who has been a true partner to
Al, in addition to her own career as an
artist—the very best as he retires from
the chamber. I also look forward to the
Hodges’ continued success in economic
development as they go on to launch
the next phase of their lives and ca-
reers. Many more will benefit from
their continued efforts in this field.∑

TRIBUTE TO TED AMES
∑ Mr. KING. Madam President, today I
wish to recognize Mr. Ted Ames, of
Stonington, ME, as he retires from the
board of directors for Maine Center for
Coastal Fisheries, MCCF. Ted has been
a lifelong member of the Maine fishing
community, and his knowledge and ex-
pertise will be missed by the board of
MCCF. Maine fishing communities and
our entire State are proud of Ted’s
work and we wish him all the best in
his retirement.
Ted was born and raised on
Vinalhaven, one of the many vibrant
island communities off the coast of
Maine. Like so many before him, Ted
has the ocean in his blood; he spent
more than three decades as the captain
of two boats, the F/V Mary Elizabeth
and F/V Dorothy M., fishing for ground-
fish, scallops, and lobster. Ted was an
early member of the Stonington Fish-
eries Alliance and then founded and
served on the board of the Penobscot
East Resource Center in Stonington,
which is now the Maine Center for
Coastal Fisheries. Ted also founded and
directed the Zone C Lobster Hatchery
in Stonington. He is the former execu-
tive director of the Maine Gillnetters
Association and a member of the Maine
Marine Resources Committee to Estab-
lish a Lobster Zone Management Plan.
Not only did Ted have a long career
as a fisherman, but he also taught at
the University of Maine and Mt. Desert
Island High School, educating the next
generation about chemistry, bio-
chemistry, and environmental science.
Ted has a M.S. in biochemistry with a
specialty in tissue culture and 6 years
of research experience; he has won nu-
merous recognitions including the 2005
MacArthur Foundation’s Genius
Award, Monmouth University’s 2007
‘‘Champion of the Oceans’’ Award, and
was named a visiting coastal studies
scholar at Bowdoin College in 2010. In
2007, he was the Geddes W. Simpson
Distinguished Lecturer at the Univer-
sity of Maine for his work at the inter-
section of science and history.
Ted’s career clearly shows his pas-
sion for ensuring that the tradition of
fishing is preserved for generations to
come. Ted has worked to restore cod,
haddock, and flounder in the eastern
Gulf of Maine, working with the Maine
Department of Marine Resources to
conduct interviews with retired fisher-
men, map historical stock distribu-
tions, and publish a paper that helped
provide the scientific evidence that
would explain the depletion of the fish
in the area.
Ted has served his community and
the State of Maine for many years in
so many ways, and we are lucky to call
him one of our own. While we will miss
Ted’s wisdom, knowledge, and work
ethic at MCCF, we wish him and his
wife Robin Alden nothing but the best
in this new chapter.∑

REMEMBERING BARNEY
GOTTSTEIN
∑ Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President,
I speak in loving memory of Barney
Gottstein, a patriarch of Alaska’s Jew-
ish community, who passed away on
October 21 at the age of 91. He was bur-
ied in the Anchorage Cemetery on Oc-
tober 22, in accordance with Jewish
burial traditions.
I suspect that my colleagues might
not be aware that Alaska is home to a
thriving Jewish community or that the
origins of that community preceded
statehood by generations. One might
be even more surprised to know that
Barney was not the first generation of
Gottsteins to occupy a leadership role
in prestatehood Alaska, but the second
generation. The Gottstein family is up
to four generations of leadership, with
a fifth—the great-grandchildren—now
in place.
The first generation, Barney’s father,
Jacob B. Gottstein, originally of Des
Moines, IA, came to Anchorage in 1915,
selling cigars and confections out of
the tent city established to construct
the Alaska railroad. Jake, as he was
known, then opened a wholesale gro-
cery and dry goods business, known as
J.B. Gottstein & Co., which made sales
calls by dog sled. You can’t get more
Alaskan than that. Jake passed away
in 1963.
Barney was born in Des Moines in
1925, but soon moved to Anchorage,
population 2,500, where he was raised.
He enlisted in the Army and served in
the Army Air Corps. After the war,
Barney went to the University of
Washington, studying to be an aero-
nautical engineer. That didn’t work
out so well. He was told by a counselor

that anti-Semitism would likely pre-
vent Barney from getting a job in his
chosen field, so he switched to business
and economics and came home to work
in the family business, but he didn’t
abandon his love for flying. Barney was
a licensed private pilot who loved to fly
around Alaska and beyond.
By the time Barney returned home,
the family business was growing as fast
as the State. The focus had changed
from dry goods to wholesale groceries.
Barney took it the next step. One of
J.B. Gottstein’s customers was the
Carr Brothers Grocery. The rest is his-
tory.
Barney partnered with Larry Carr to
grow the retail grocery business and
pursue real estate ventures. Carr’s
Quality Centers sprung up throughout
Alaska, along with an associated chain
of Eagle markets. By the late 1980s, the
Carr-Gottstein group of companies was
the largest Alaska-owned business in
the State. Barney and Larry sold the
grocery side of the business in 1990 but
remained in the real estate business.
Today the Carr’s name remains on gro-
cery stores in Anchorage, Eagle River,
and the Mat-Su Valley.
In 1989, Barney was inducted into the
Alaska Business Hall of Fame, and in
1991, he was awarded an honorary doc-
tor of laws degree by the University of
Alaska Fairbanks.
Barney’s business success in Alaska
was deeply respected, but his commu-
nity engagement even more so. He was
chair of the Alaska Board of Education
and provided financial assistance that
enabled hundreds of Alaska Natives to
pursue schooling. He was an inaugural
member of the Alaska State Commis-
sion on Human Rights as well.
Barney was active in Alaska’s polit-
ical life as well. He was chairman of
the Alaska Democratic Party, Alaska’s
Democratic National Committeeman,
and an Alaska delegate to the Demo-
cratic National Conventions.
I mentioned that Barney was one of
the patriarchs of Alaska’s Jewish com-
munity. An early supporter of the
State of Israel, he was the face of the
American Israel Public Affairs Com-
mittee, AIPAC, in Alaska for many
years. Today, Barney’s son David leads
the AIPAC group in Alaska and, in that
capacity, is a frequent visitor to my of-
fice. He provided financial support to
enable young Jewish Alaskans to par-
ticipate in the ‘‘March of the Living,’’
so that they might better understand
the legacy of the Holocaust. He visited
Israel on many occasions and took on
the cause of supporting Ethiopian Jews
who had made Aliyah to Israel inte-
grate into society and pursue advanced
degrees.
Barney was not only a father figure
to the Alaska Jewish community. He
was the patriarch of a large family
himself. Barney is survived by Rachel,
his second wife, of 32 years, who not
surprisingly he met on a trip to Israel.
Barney was father to seven children.
Some of Barney’s children have fol-
lowed in their father’s footsteps to
achieve positions of great respect and
prominence in Alaska. I am proud to
count David, Jim, Robert, and Sandy
among my friends. A fourth generation
of the Gottstein family, the grand-
children, are just beginning to make
their mark, and there are great-grand-
children behind them.
On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I
proudly pay my respects to Barney
Gottstein and his wonderful family.
May his memory be a blessing.∑

bill be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the text of

the RECORD, as follows:
S. 117
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Disability
Integration Act of 2019’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the fol-
lowing:
(1) In enacting the Americans with Disabil-
ities Act of 1990 (referred to in this Act as
the ‘‘ADA’’), Congress—
(A) recognized that ‘‘historically, society
has tended to isolate and segregate individ-
uals with disabilities, and, despite some im-
provements, such forms of discrimination
against individuals with disabilities con-
tinue to be a serious and pervasive social
problem’’; and
(B) intended that the ADA assure ‘‘full par-
ticipation’’ and ‘‘independent living’’ for in-
dividuals with disabilities by addressing
‘‘discrimination against individuals with dis-
abilities [that] persists in critical areas’’, in-
cluding institutionalization.
(2) While Congress expected that the ADA’s
integration mandate would be interpreted in
a manner that ensures that individuals who
are eligible for institutional placement are
able to exercise a right to community-based
long-term services and supports, that expec-
tation has not been fulfilled.
(3) The holdings of the Supreme Court in
Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), and com-
panion cases, have clearly articulated that
individuals with disabilities have a civil
right under the ADA to participate in soci-
ety as equal citizens. However, many States
still do not provide sufficient community-
based long-term services and supports to in-
dividuals with disabilities to end segregation
in institutions.
(4) The right to live in the community is
necessary for the exercise of the civil rights
that the ADA was intended to secure for all
individuals with disabilities. The lack of ade-
quate community-based services and sup-
ports has imperiled the civil rights of all in-
dividuals with disabilities, and has under-
mined the very promise of the ADA. It is,
therefore, necessary to recognize in statute a
robust and fully articulated right to commu-
nity living.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S222 January 15, 2019
(5) States, with a few exceptions, continue
to approach decisions regarding long-term
services and supports from social welfare and
budgetary perspectives, but for the promise
of the ADA to be fully realized, States must
approach these decisions from a civil rights
perspective.
(6) States have not consistently planned to
ensure sufficient services and supports for
individuals with disabilities, including those
with the most significant disabilities, to en-
able individuals with disabilities to live in
the most integrated setting. As a result,
many individuals with disabilities who re-
side in institutions are prevented from resid-
ing in the community and individuals with
disabilities who are not in institutions find
themselves at risk of institutional place-
ment.
(7) The continuing existence of unfair and
unnecessary institutionalization denies indi-
viduals with disabilities the opportunity to
live and participate on an equal basis in the
community and costs the United States bil-
lions of dollars in unnecessary spending re-
lated to perpetuating dependency and unnec-
essary confinement.
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act
are—
(1) to clarify and strengthen the ADA’s in-
tegration mandate in a manner that acceler-
ates State compliance;
(2) to clarify that every individual who is
eligible for long-term services and supports
has a federally protected right to be mean-
ingfully integrated into that individual’s
community and receive community-based
long-term services and supports;
(3) to ensure that States provide long-term
services and supports to individuals with dis-
abilities in a manner that allows individuals
with disabilities to live in the most inte-
grated setting, including the individual’s
own home, have maximum control over their
services and supports, and ensure that long-
term services and supports are provided in a
manner that allows individuals with disabil-
ities to lead an independent life;
(4) to establish a comprehensive State
planning requirement that includes enforce-
able, measurable objectives that are de-
signed to transition individuals with all
types of disabilities at all ages out of institu-
tions and into the most integrated setting;
and
(5) to establish a requirement for clear and
uniform annual public reporting by States
that includes reporting about—
(A) the number of individuals with disabil-
ities who are served in the community and
the number who are served in institutions;
and
(B) the number of individuals with disabil-
ities who have transitioned from an institu-
tion to a community-based living situation,
and the type of community-based living situ-
ation into which those individuals have
transitioned.
SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS AND RULE.
(a) DEFINITIONS.—In this Act:
(1) ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING.—The term
‘‘activities of daily living’’ has the meaning
given the term in section 441.505 of title 42,
Code of Federal Regulations (or a successor
regulation).
(2) ADMINISTRATOR.—The term ‘‘Adminis-
trator’’ means—
(A) the Administrator of the Administra-
tion for Community Living; or

nity-based’’, when used in reference to serv-
ices or supports, means services or supports
that are provided to an individual with an
LTSS disability to enable that individual to
live in the community and lead an inde-
pendent life, and that are delivered in which-
ever setting the individual with an LTSS dis-
ability has chosen out of the following set-
tings with the following qualities:
(A) In the case of a dwelling or a nonresi-
dential setting (such as a setting in which an
individual with an LTSS disability receives
day services and supported employment), a
dwelling or setting—
(i) that, as a matter of infrastructure, en-
vironment, amenities, location, services, and
features, is integrated into the greater com-
munity and supports, for each individual
with an LTSS disability who receives serv-
ices or supports at the setting—
(I) full access to the greater community
(including access to opportunities to seek
employment and work in competitive inte-
grated settings, engage in community life,
control personal resources, and receive serv-
ices in the community); and
(II) access to the greater community to the
same extent as access to the community is

(ii) that the individual has selected as a
meaningful choice from among nonresiden-
tial setting options, including nondisability-
specific settings;
(iii) in which an individual has rights to
privacy, dignity, and respect, and freedom
from coercion and restraint;
(iv) that, as a matter of infrastructure, en-
vironment, amenities, location, services, and
features, optimizes, but does not regiment,
individual initiative, autonomy, and inde-
pendence in making life choices, including
choices about daily activities, physical envi-
ronment, and persons with whom the indi-
vidual interacts; and
(v) that, as a matter of infrastructure, en-
vironment, amenities, location, services, and
features, facilitates individual choice regard-
ing the provision of services and supports,
and who provides those services and sup-
ports.
(B) In the case of a dwelling, a dwelling—
(i) that is owned by an individual with an
LTSS disability or the individual’s family
member;
(ii) that is leased to the individual with an
LTSS disability under an individual lease,
that has lockable access and egress, and that
includes living, sleeping, bathing, and cook-
ing areas over which an individual with an
LTSS disability or the individual’s family
member has domain and control; or
(iii) that is a group or shared residence—
(I) in which no more than 4 unrelated indi-
viduals with an LTSS disability reside;
(II) for which each individual with an
LTSS disability living at the residence owns,
rents, or occupies the residence under a le-
gally enforceable agreement under which the
individual has, at a minimum, the same re-
sponsibilities and protections as tenants
have under applicable landlord-tenant law;
(III) in which each individual with an

By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself,
Ms. HARRIS, Ms. WARREN, Mr.
MENENDEZ, and Mr. MARKEY):
S. 127. A bill to direct the Secretary
of Veterans Affairs to seek to enter
into an agreement with the city of
Vallejo, California, for the transfer of
Mare Island Naval Cemetery in Vallejo,
California, and for other purposes; to
the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs.
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President,
today I am proud to reintroduce the
Mare Island Naval Cemetery Transfer
Act, which would transfer control of
the Mare Island Naval Cemetery from
the City of Vallejo in California to the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
where it belongs.
The Mare Island Naval Cemetery is
the oldest military cemetery on the
West Coast. Opened in 1856, it was
originally part of Mare Island Naval
Shipyard, the first U.S. naval base es-
tablished on the Pacific Ocean. The
historic cemetery is the final resting
place for 860 veterans and their loved
ones, including three Medal of Honor
recipients. Anna Arnold Key, the
daughter of Francis Scott Key, is also
buried there, next to her husband who
fought in the War of 1812. After the
base closed in 1996, the nearby City of
Vallejo assumed control of the naval
property and cemetery.
Unfortunately, the city doesn’t have
the necessary funds to properly care
for the cemetery. The city is also ineli-
gible for VA support since it’s not part
of the State or Federal government.
The maintenance, therefore, is left to
volunteers with limited resources who
lack the expertise necessary to main-
tain this historic cemetery.
The cemetery has fallen into dis-
repair and is no longer a fitting tribute
to the brave men and women buried
there. Gravestones are toppled over,
broken, or sinking into the ground.
Plants and weeds are overgrown, and
water is pooling due to the lack of
proper drainage. The cemetery’s cur-
rent condition requires urgent action
to restore the gravestones and grounds
to a respectable condition. Our bill
would accomplish this by transferring
control to the VA’s National Cemetery
Administration.
The transfer would not only allow
the VA to restore the cemetery, but
also ensure it’s maintained for future
generations to pay their respects to the
heroes buried there. I want to thank
Congressman MIKE THOMPSON (D–CA)
for leading this effort in the House.
Passing this bill would be a small, but
important, token of our gratitude to
the veterans to whom we owe so much.

S. RES. 18
Whereas Texas, Wisconsin, Alabama, Ar-
kansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana,
Kansas, Louisiana, Paul LePage (Governor of
Maine), Mississippi (by and through Gov-
ernor Phil Bryant), Missouri, Nebraska,
North Dakota, South Carolina, South Da-
kota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, and
individual plaintiffs have filed suit in the
United States District Court for the North-
ern District of Texas, arguing that the Pa-
tient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(Public Law 111–148; 124 Stat. 119) and the
Health Care and Education Reconciliation
Act of 2010 (Public Law 111–152; 124 Stat. 1029)
are unconstitutional and should be enjoined,
by asserting that the requirement under
those Acts to maintain minimum essential
coverage (commonly known as the ‘‘indi-
vidual responsibility provision’’) in section
5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is
unconstitutional following the amendment
of that provision by the Act to provide for
reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of
the concurrent resolution on the budget for
fiscal year 2018 (Public Law 115–97; 131 Stat.
2054) (commonly known as the ‘‘Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act’’);
Whereas these State and individual plain-
tiffs also seek to strike down the entire Pa-
tient Protection and Affordable Care Act as
not severable from the individual responsi-
bility provision;
Whereas, on June 7, 2018, the Department
of Justice refused to defend the constitu-
tionality of the amended individual responsi-
bility provision, despite the well-established
duty of the Department to defend Federal
statutes where reasonable arguments can be
made in their defense;
Whereas the Department of Justice not
only refused to defend the amended indi-
vidual responsibility provision, but it affirm-
atively argued that this provision is uncon-
stitutional and that the provisions of the Pa-
tient Protection and Affordable Care Act
guaranteeing issuance of insurance coverage
regardless of health status or pre-existing
conditions (commonly known as the ‘‘guar-
anteed issue provision’’), sections 2702, 2704,
and 2705(a) of the Public Health Service Act
(42 U.S.C. 300gg–1, 300gg–3, 300gg–4(a)), and
prohibiting discriminatory premium rates
(commonly known as the ‘‘community rating
provision’’), sections 2701 and 2705(b) of the
Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.
300gg(a)(1), 300gg–4(b)), must now be struck
down as not severable from the individual re-
sponsibility provision; and
Whereas the district court in Texas v.
United States, No. 4:18–cv–00167–O (N.D. Tex.)
issued an order on December 14, 2018 declar-
ing that the individual responsibility provi-
sion in section 5000A of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 is unconstitutional and that all
the provisions of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act are not severable and
therefore are invalid: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate Legal Counsel is
authorized to represent the Senate in Texas

f
MEDICARE
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise
to talk about the Medicare Program
and in particular a news story that
came to our attention this past week-
end.
This is the headline from a story
dated January 11, late in the day, and
it is by The Hill newspaper. You will
not be able to see it from a distance,
but the headline reads: ‘‘Trump offi-
cials consider allowing Medicaid block
grants for states.’’
Here is what just the first two short
paragraphs outline. The story begins as
follows:
The Trump administration is considering
moving forward with a major conservative
change to Medicaid by allowing States to get
block grants for the program, sources say.
Capping the amount of money that the fed-
eral government spends on the health insur-
ance program for the poor through a block
grant has long been a conservative goal. It
was a controversial part of the ObamaCare
repeal debate in 2017, with much of the pub-
lic rallying against cuts to Medicaid.
After the failure of that repeal effort, the
Trump administration is now considering
issuing guidance to states encouraging them
to apply for caps on federal Medicaid spend-
ing in exchange for additional flexibility on
how they run the program, according to peo-
ple familiar with the discussions.
I will not read the rest of the story,
and I will not enter the whole story
into the RECORD because folks can look
it up, and there are other stories as
well that cover this same news. So, in
a sense, it is a big new development,
but it is an old story.
It is an old story of Members of Con-
gress and the administration coming
together to try to make changes to the
Medicaid Program. In this case, it dif-
fers only slightly in that, so far at
least, this seems to be an initiative
that is an administration-led initia-
tive. We are not aware of any—as far as
I know—congressional involvement,
but it is not all that much different,
right? It is the same thing.
We had a long debate in 2017 about
whether we should not only repeal the
Affordable Care Act but thereby do two
things to Medicaid—one is to end over
time Medicaid expansion, and second
would be to have cuts to Medicaid that
would result from this same idea, the
so-called block granting of Medicaid.
I believe we litigated—if we can use
that word in a legislative sense—that
in 2017. The repeal bill did not pass the
Senate in the summer of 2017. There
were other attempts that didn’t come
to a vote on full repeal. Then we had an
election in 2018. Healthcare was a
major part of that debate, most of it
centering on protections for pre-
existing conditions and other consumer
protections in the law.
If you look at the last 2 years, we had
one-party rule in Washington—Repub-
lican President, House, and Senate.
There were major efforts by the admin-
istration and by both majorities in the
Houses of Congress to make substan-
tial changes to Medicaid, and it did not
happen. So failing all those attempts,
now the administration, I would as-
sume, is trying to do it secretively but,
now exposed, wants to make changes to
Medicaid by way of granting waivers
and inviting States to, in essence,
change Medicaid at the State level.
This initiative will not affect Penn-
sylvania—or it is highly unlikely to af-
fect Pennsylvania in the near term. So
this is about major parts of the coun-
try but not every State. It is a bad
idea, in short order, because what this
block granting means is benefits get
cut.
It is very simple. When you cut a pro-
gram that is focused on healthcare for
low-income children, healthcare cov-
erage for those with disabilities, chil-
dren and adults, and helping seniors
have the benefit of skilled care in a
nursing home—that is another benefit
of Medicaid—you are talking about
benefits being cut over time. Maybe
there will be more cuts in one State
versus the other, depending upon the
nature of the waiver and the particu-
lars of the program in that State, but
it is going to be cutting Medicaid. It is
a bad idea, and I think the American
people understand that, especially
after the debate in 2017. It is a bad idea,
and I think the American people under-
stand that.
Maybe there are some folks who
didn’t really appreciate Medicaid; prob-
ably a lot of them in Washington didn’t
appreciate Medicaid before the 2017 and
2018 debates. Maybe there are folks who
weren’t paying attention for a lot of
years and didn’t realize the scope of
Medicaid, didn’t realize it covers 70
million Americans. I know that is why
some Republican-elected officials in
the Congress are very hostile to it;
they think it covers too many people.
But after 2017, those who were mis-
informed or had forgotten or just were
never aware of the benefits of Medicaid
got a real good reminder because of the
debate we had. That was one positive
outgrowth of that long and difficult de-
bate on healthcare generally—the Af-
fordable Care Act specifically—but
also, by extension, Medicaid.
A proposal like this to block-grant
Medicaid, which was proposed numer-
ous times here in the Congress over the
last couple of years, hurts basically
those three groups of Americans. It
hurts kids, hurts people with disabil-
ities, and hurts our seniors.
I think the part of it that people tend
to forget is that this program helps
middle-class families as well. If you
have a disability, your income might
be higher than low income, but you get
the benefit of Medicaid. A lot of mid-
dle-class families have a loved one in a
nursing home who would not be able to
afford that kind of long-term care
without the benefit of Medicaid. A lot
of those families are middle class.
When it comes to children, of course,
it is for children from low-income fam-
ilies, but those children are getting

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S228 January 15, 2019
what many believe to be the gold
standard for children’s healthcare.
I like to say that in Pennsylvania,
Medicaid is a 40–50–60 program. It is
real simple: 40 percent of the kids in
our State, thankfully, have the benefit
of Medicaid; 50 percent of people with
disabilities—roughly, about half of the
people in our State with disabilities
get the benefit of Medicaid. Thank
goodness they do. Thirdly, 60 percent of
people getting long-term care in Penn-
sylvania could not get it without the
benefit of Medicaid.
In some States, the percentages
might be higher or lower than that, but
when you have a program that covers
40 percent of your children, 50 percent
of your population with disabilities,
and 60 percent of your seniors could get
long-term care, which they need—those
folks who have long-term care need it
and have to have it. When you have
that kind of program, which covers
roughly 2 million people in Pennsyl-
vania and 70 million nationwide, you
are going to get the attention of a lot
of people when you are messing with it.
That is a technical term, ‘‘messing
with it.’’ By saying, to some degree,
under the cover of darkness—not hav-
ing a debate on the floor of the House
or the Senate but sending guidance to
States, inviting them to apply for a
waiver, and it takes a while to approve
the waiver, then all of a sudden it
comes out, and the waiver is granted—
guess what. If you live in a State where
that happens and you are on Medicaid,
you might not have Medicaid a year
from the waiver being granted—or 2
years or 5 years. At some point, you
may be adversely affected by that. This
is very serious business when it comes
to those very vulnerable Americans.
In so many ways, Medicaid, like a lot
of things we debate here—not only
Medicaid, but Medicaid is one of many
examples we could cite—tells us who
we are as a nation. People around the
world don’t respect America simply be-
cause America has the strongest, best
military. We have the best fighting
men and women in the world; no one is
even close. But there are a lot of na-
tions that spend a lot on their military
and have strong, fighting men and
women; they have a strong military,
and they are not respected like we are.
Thank God we have a strong military
and the strongest economy in the
world. We are blessed by that.
But one of the other ways the world
respects us is that they often conclude
that we treat our own people better
than some other places do. Medicaid,
which is a 50-year-old program, is a
program that tells us who we are as a
nation, whom we value, and whom we
are willing to fight on behalf of. It tells
us a lot about who we are. America is
great because we care deeply about
those 70 million people who get the
benefit of that program, just as we care
deeply about other Americans who ben-
efit or have a connection to our gov-
ernment.
Before any administration or any
part of our government takes an action
that will lead to the cutting back of a
program like Medicaid—whether it is
by way of legislation or by way of
waiver or regulation—they need to
hear from us.
I, for one, am willing to fight on this
for a long time. If I do nothing else but
fight this battle, sign me up because we
are going to fight hard. I am not cer-
tain we will win, but I think we will
win this battle. Medicaid tells us who
we are. Why do I say that? Well, be-
cause we hear from families all the
time.
I got a letter at the beginning of the
debate in 2017 from a mom. Like a lot
of Members of the Senate, you get a
letter from a mom or a dad or a family
member who sits down to put pen to
paper—in a sense, to write you a letter
or send you an email or to express
what their lives will be like without a
program, what their lives will be like if
a change goes forward.
In this case it was Pam, a mom talk-
ing about her son Rowan. Rowan is on
the autism spectrum. This mom talks
about the prospect of not just learning
that and what that meant to her and
her family and the challenge of it, ob-
viously, but also the benefits she re-
ceived because of Medicaid—in Penn-
sylvania we call it Medical Assistance,
or by the shorthand, MA.
I will not read the whole letter, but
Pam talks about, in just one example
of what Medicaid means, the wrap-
around services—all of the services
that a child who has a disability gets,
maybe on either the autism spectrum
or a physical disability or maybe a
child who has Down syndrome.
In this case, Rowan is on the autism
spectrum. She talks about the behav-
ioral specialist consultant and the
therapeutic staff support work that
helps her and the benefits of that and
what that means to Pam, as a mom,
and to her family—but also what it
means to her son Rowan. She talks
about Rowan benefiting ‘‘immensely
from a program called the Child Guid-
ance Resource Center,’’ which recently
started a new program called the CRE-
ATE Program. It is a social skills pro-
gram specifically for autistic children
ages 3 to 21. She enrolled Rowan in
that so-called CREATE Program.
She goes on to say: ‘‘I am thrilled by
Rowan’s daily progress. I cannot say
enough great things about this pro-
gram.’’
That program would not be part of
the life of that family, absent Med-
icaid. That program would not be part
of the life of that family in the in-
stance where that family was living in
a State that had been granted a waiver
that allowed block grants that, there-
by, allowed cuts that resulted in that
family not getting that kind of service.
Thankfully, she is in a State where
the Medicaid Program is strong and
will be defended aggressively. But I
don’t want a Rowan in another State
or a Pam—a mom in another State—
not having the benefit that Rowan in
Pennsylvania has and that Pam in
Pennsylvania has.
Pam goes on to say: ‘‘Without med-
ical assistance, our family would be
bankrupt or my son would go without
the therapies he sincerely needs.’’
At the end of the letter, she con-
cludes by asking me, as her representa-
tive, to think about her family when
we are debating these issues. She talks
about her husband and her son Rowan
first, and then she concludes the letter
this way:
Please think of my 9-month-old daughter,
Luna, who smiles and laughs at her brother
daily; she will have to care for Rowan late in
her life after we are gone. Overall, we are
desperately in need of Rowan’s Medical As-
sistance and would be devastated if we lost
these benefits.
That is what one mom said about the
importance of Medicaid to that family.
My point in raising this issue—even
though, thankfully, we have beaten
back an effort to legislatively change
the Medicaid Program for the worse,
and we now have an administrative ef-
fort to undermine the program, but I
raise this simply to say that family in
America should not have to worry for
10 minutes about whether their govern-
ment is going to continue those impor-
tant benefits to their son or to their
daughter, whatever the case may be.
Maybe their mom is in a nursing home
or maybe a neighbor has a son or a
daughter who, because of income lev-
els, is getting Medicaid. They shouldn’t
have to worry for 10 or 15 minutes
about that because we are America. We
made the decision 50 years ago—and it
was a good decision—to take care of
those families and to do everything we
could.
Some days we will not get it right;
some days we will make mistakes. But
on most days, a program like that is
helping lots of families, tens of mil-
lions of them, and the bureaucrats or
the elected officials or the administra-
tion officials in Washington who seek
to make changes that will adversely af-
fect even one of those families has to
look those families in the eye—or
should look them in the eye—and tell
them why that is good, not just for
that family but why that is good for
America. How is that going to help us?
I know what the argument will be. I
hear it over and over again. They say
that the program is unsustainable,
right? We are not going to be able to
afford this much Medicaid 10 years
from now, 15 years from now, 25 years
from now. Well, when they say
‘‘unsustainable’’ around here, I want to
translate for you. That means they are
not willing to make people of means
pay for it. Let me say it bluntly: If we
have to charge someone else who has a
high income to preserve Medicaid, sign
me up for that too.
Let’s be very clear about this. This
program is that important. I believe
there are a lot of Americans of means—
of high incomes—who would want to
make sure this program is preserved. I
know there are some politicians around
here who are always talking about how
you have to make sure that they have

low tax rates, but I think a lot of those
Americans want to preserve the Med-
icaid Program, want to strengthen it,
want to make changes that are appro-
priate, want to make it more efficient
where we can, but there are a lot of
Americans out there of great means
who want this program preserved. So
we have a lot of work to do to make
sure we move in the right direction.
Let me make one or two more final
points, and I will conclude.
One of the other questions is, What
happens if a block grant proposal goes
through nationwide but even in more
limited instances?
Way back in November of 2016, one of
the many organizations that track this
kind of a program over time—the Med-
icaid Program or healthcare pro-
grams—issued a report. It has issued
many of these reports, but here is just
one for your consideration. The name
of the organization is Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities. It is here in
Washington and has been around a long
time. It was very helpful in the debate
on healthcare and about the impact of
various proposals.
Here is what the Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities said in November
of 2016. The date was November 30, 2016.
In order to save some space, I will not
read the whole report, and I will not
enter it into the RECORD. People can
look it up, right?
Here is the headline: ‘‘Medicaid
Block Grant Would Slash Federal
Funding, Shift Costs to States, and
Leave Millions More Uninsured.’’
Here is what some of the headlines
say in the report. The first one reads
‘‘A block grant would cap Federal Med-
icaid funding in order to achieve sav-
ings for the Federal Government.’’
That is what the proposal is intended
to do.
No. 2, ‘‘The likely magnitude of the
Federal funding cuts and resulting
cost-shift to States would be very
large.’’
No. 3, ‘‘Such a block grant would
push states to cut their Medicaid pro-
grams deeply.’’
The last two are as follows: ‘‘Med-
icaid is already efficient and innova-
tive.’’ That is true. We don’t talk about
that enough, but it is true.
The last headline is ‘‘A Medicaid
block grant would lead to draconian
cuts to eligibility, benefits, and pro-
vider payment rates.’’ What they didn’t
mention there is that cuts to Medicaid
would also hurt a lot of hospitals, espe-
cially rural hospitals.
Here is the number from the House
Republican budget plan for fiscal year
2017. We are going back now to the lat-
ter part of 2016. Here is what the report
concludes, and this is in the instance of
being implemented as law: ‘‘It would
have cut federal Medicaid funding by $1
trillion—or nearly 25 percent—over ten
years, relative to current law, on top of
the cuts the plan would secure from re-
pealing the ACA’s Medicaid expan-
sion.’’
I realize that number is bigger than
what we are talking about here because
we are talking about a number of
States changing their Medicaid Pro-
grams because of a block granting
waiver that was granted to that par-
ticular State, but I am not too con-
cerned about the overall number be-
cause that is impossible to predict.
Even if just one State were to be
granted this kind of a waiver in imple-
mented block grants, a lot of people in
that State would lose their Medicaid. I
think we should be concerned if it were
one person losing Medicaid because of
that, let alone thousands or tens of
thousands or hundreds of thousands or,
in fact, millions. If block granting were
to be granted for the whole country,
you would be talking about double-fig-
ure millions losing that kind of cov-
erage. Even if it were to be a much
smaller number, we should be very con-
cerned about this.
Here is another reason not to mess
around with Medicaid in a way that ad-
versely impacts people or undermines
the program. I hear from a lot of politi-
cians in Washington from both Houses
and both parties. I think, in almost
every instance—and there is probably
an exception to this—they speak from
their hearts and do truly care about
what is happening in their commu-
nities and in their States because of
the opioid crisis. It is everywhere. It is
urban, rural, and suburban. It is every-
where, and it is devastating. We have
never seen a public health problem like
it in probably 100 years or at least not
anything worse than it. It is a problem
in Pennsylvania, and it is a problem in
every State, as I am sure the Presiding
Officer would agree. Yet here is the
part they don’t talk about. Sometimes
the same people say, ‘‘I really am wor-
ried about the opioid crisis, and I want
to do the following to help people who
are in the grip of that addiction, and I
want to institute a program or provide
funding or otherwise,’’ and that is won-
derful when they have that initiative.
Yet sometimes those same Members of
Congress, in the next breath, will say,
‘‘But I want to block grant Medicaid’’
or ‘‘I want to cut or cap Medicaid’’ or
‘‘We need to cut back on what we spend
on Medicaid,’’ and they vote for budget
after budget after budget and bill after
bill to cut Medicaid.
What do you think is the No. 1 payer
when it comes to the opioid crisis, the
primary payer for opioid treatment and
recovery? You guessed it—Medicaid.
If you are going to go down this road
and talk about this program as if it
were some far-off program for them, for
someone else, you should look in the
mirror because Medicaid is an ‘‘us’’
program, not a ‘‘them’’ program and
not a program for someone far away. It
is for our neighbors. It is for our
friends if they have opioid addictions
and can only get treatment and serv-
ices mostly because of Medicaid expan-
sion—actually, as part of the Afford-
able Care Act.
Medicaid itself, the core program, of
course, is a program that makes sure
that a child has healthcare. Even if he
is of low income and his mom or his
dad or the person taking care of him is
not working and doesn’t have employer
coverage, he gets the benefit of Med-
icaid. Guess what. When that low-in-
come child gets Medicaid, we all ben-
efit. That child is more likely to grow
up healthy, and he or she will be more
productive and will be a stronger part
of our economy. So Medicaid for low-
income children or children from low-
income families helps all of us. It
doesn’t just help that child. It is not
just a nice thing to do. It is the right
thing to do, but it is also very prac-
tical.
Medicaid helps people with disabil-
ities whether they have profound dis-
abilities or otherwise. They have to be
eligible for it based upon their disabil-
ities, but we have made a decision that
that is a good thing to do for that indi-
vidual and for society. The same is true
of people making decisions about a
loved one’s going into long-term care
and one’s spending down one’s assets,
and there is usually a big gap after one
spends down. Middle-class families—
sometimes people above middle class—
spend down. They can’t afford the cost
of nursing home care, and the State
says and the Federal Government says:
We want to help you.
That is why Medicaid is so critical to
nursing homes. If you look at the dol-
lars spent, it would not be entirely in-
accurate to say that Medicaid is a
nursing home program with help for
children and people with disabilities as
well.
I am just putting the administration
on notice that if it wants to continue
to pursue this, we are going to have a
big fight about it, and it is a fight that
will go on for a long time. It will go on
in the courts. We will litigate it on this
floor. We will litigate it in committees
and fight about it in the House and in
the Senate. We will fight in the streets
of our States, and we will fight about it
for a long time until we win because we
have other things to do to lift people
up around here. We have to do more on
healthcare—lower the cost of
healthcare, lower the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs—and make sure that these
programs work well. We don’t have
time for throwing millions of people off
of healthcare or tens of millions off of
healthcare. There is a broad, bipartisan
consensus on a whole range of things
we could do on healthcare. That is
what we should work on.
The administration, if it is doing the
right thing, would abandon these reck-
less, extreme ideas on Medicaid and
join us—join both parties in both
Houses—in trying to do something
positive and constructive and Amer-
ican on healthcare. I don’t think it is
American to say to a child, ‘‘Yes, you
had Medicaid before, but we couldn’t
afford it. You are not going to have
healthcare any longer’’ or to say that
to someone with a disability or to a
senior.
If the administration wants to fight,
we are going to be ready to fight, and

HONORING MERCED NAACP
PRESIDENT DARRYL DAVIS
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 15, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor outgoing Merced NAACP President
Darryl Davis. Mr. Davis’s tenure as president
and his various leadership roles highlight his
distinguished lifetime of public service and
commitment to serving our community.
Mr. Davis began his decades of service to
the greater Merced community in 1987 when
he was stationed at Castle Air Force Base.
After his time in the military and graduation
from the Criminal Justice Training Center (Po-
lice Academy) at Modesto Junior College, Mr.
Davis began his career in law enforcement.
Throughout his career, he worked in multiple
capacities with the Merced County Sheriff’s
and District Attorney’s Offices and then as an
officer at UC Merced. In each of these roles
and in his current job as a fraud investigator
with Merced County, Mr. Davis has served
with distinction and exhibited strong profes-
sionalism, leadership, and integrity, which
have made him a well-respected member of
the community.
Having been a member of the NAACP for
many years, Mr. Davis was sworn in as the
Merced branch president in 2015 and has
since used his unique perspective gained
throughout his career to further the NAACP’s
mission to ensure equal rights and eliminate
race-based discrimination. During his four
years as president, Mr. Davis has continued to
build the organization’s membership and rela-
tionships to further educate others about the
social issues facing our country and commu-
nity, including topics such as the effects of
gangs and incarceration on minority youths,
police encounters, and lawful protests.
Mr. Davis has exhibited the same level of
commitment, integrity, and professionalism
during his time as the local NAACP president
that he has had during his law enforcement
career. The unique perspective he has as a
police officer, combined with his ability to bring
people together and desire to help others
have undoubtedly had a positive impact on the
greater Merced community.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in honoring a man who has made sig-
nificant contributions to our country and com-
munity through his distinguished career and
extensive civic involvement. It is both fitting
and appropriate that we honor Darryl Davis
and wish him the best as he concludes his
term as president of the Merced NAACP
branch.

HONORING BARBARA PLANTE
HON. DEBBIE LESKO
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 15, 2019
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor and celebrate the incredible work
Barbara Plante has done for the United States
Air Force and Luke Air Force Base in my
home district. Barbara is retiring this month
after an incredibly distinguished career serving
our country. She has served the Air Force for
35 years, including 26 of those years at Luke
Air Force Base.
Currently, Barbara serves as the Deputy Di-
rector of the Community Initiatives Team at
Luke Air Force Base. She was on the public
affairs team for Luke Air Force Base from
1995 until 2013, except for when she was de-
ployed to Afghanistan in 2011 and 2012. Dur-
ing those years, she welcomed local officials
to the base, educated the public, and helped
Luke Air Force Base with recruitment. In 2013,
she transitioned from public affairs to help
lead the Community Initiatives Team, where
she learned and concentrated on state laws
and zoning.
Luke Air Force Base is home to one of the
largest fighter wings in the world, the 56th
Fighter Wing, in the middle of a growing met-
ropolitan area. The Air Force strives for safe
and supportive environments around its bases,
leading to Luke Air Force Base’s creation of
the Community Initiatives Team in 2003. While
not every base has one, Barbara’s leadership
has demonstrated how successful they can
be. She has been essential to the base and
the 56th Fighter Wing’s success.
Barbara has built tremendous support for
the base in West Valley. Her commitment to
educating city officials, real estate profes-
sionals, politicians and residents about the
state laws restricting development around the
base and why they are important has helped
secure Luke Air Force Base’s future for years
to come. As of 2017, the base supports ap-
proximately 15,070 jobs, $923 million in
wages, and $2.4 billion in direct and indirect
economic impact to Arizona.
Barbara’s warm personality and desire to
build and maintain strong relationships has
helped her successfully manage the growth at
Luke Air Force Base and the surrounding
community. Her team works with 11 cities, Ari-
zona state government and the federal gov-
ernment. Her efforts have seen direct results,
including how our surrounding cities work to-
gether for the greater good of the community
and the base. Barbara’s work has created a
fantastic and trusting relationship between our
communities and Luke Air Force Base.
Barbara’s great achievements reflect her
selfless dedication to serving our community in
Arizona. Her passion for Luke Air Force Base
and her devotion to her work for the Air Force
has opened many doors for the base. It is an
honor to be among the many in congratulating
her on this most worthy accomplishment.
I wish her my sincerest congratulations and
hope her well-earned retirement is filled with
good health and much happiness.

HONORING THE SERVICE AND SAC-
RIFICE OF PFC GARFIELD M.
LANGHORN
HON. LEE M. ZELDIN
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 15, 2019
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, today, I rise
to honor the service and sacrifice of home-
town hero and Medal of Honor recipient PFC
Garfield M. Langhorn, from Riverhead, New
York, who, 50 years ago today, saved the
lives of his platoon members at just 20 years
old, by throwing himself on a live grenade in

attempted to rescue the crews of a downed
American helicopter. Finding no surviving
crew, PFC Langhorn and his unit were return-
ing the fallen aviators when they came under
heavy fire from North Vietnamese forces.
Under the cover of darkness, the North Viet-
namese began to advance, throwing a hand
grenade in front of PFC Langhorn who was
just a few feet from his injured comrades.
It was in that moment, PFC Langhorn self-
lessly chose the courageous act President Lin-
coln once referred to as ‘‘the last full measure
of devotion’’—to his brothers, his fellow sol-
diers and his country. In that moment, he
‘‘unhesitatingly threw himself on the grenade,
scooped it beneath his body and absorbed the
blast,’’ according to his Medal of Honor Cita-
tion and the first-hand accounts of his fellow
soldiers he saved.
For his extraordinary act of bravery, PFC
Langhorn received a series of awards, includ-
ing the highest, most prestigious personal mili-
tary decoration—the Medal of Honor, and,
most recently, the Riverhead Post Office was
dedicated in his name. There is no doubt,
PFC Langhorn has earned these commenda-
tions, but they mean little if we forget to look
beyond the decorations and forever remember
and honor the actions of the 20-year-old
young man who earned them.
In saving his fellow soldiers, PFC
Langhorn’s life was extinguished too soon, but
as President Lincoln continued, ‘‘we here high-
ly resolve that these dead shall not have died
in vain.’’ Today, we must challenge ourselves
as Americans to pick up that torch, to embody
the bravery, selflessness and commitment to
our great country. There is no memorial, no
medal and no post office that can bring back
PFC Langhorn, but he can live eternally in all
of us, in our actions and in our hearts.

Tuesday, January 15, 2019
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, today I rise to
remember the life of Anthony John York, age
35, who passed away on Friday, December 7,

He is survived by his parents, brother Jed,
sisters Jenna and Mara, and nephews Jaxon

CELEBRATING THE RETIREMENT

HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA

Tuesday, January 15, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with
great respect and admiration that I take this
time to honor Mr. Ronald Powell and to wish
him well upon his retirement from his position
as president of Local 881, United Food and
Commercial Workers (UFCW) International
Union, and as vice president of the UFCW
International. Ron has devoted his life to the
working men and women of the UFCW, and
for his unwavering dedication, he is to be
commended. Mr. Powell will be honored at a
retirement celebration taking place at Gibsons
Bar & Steakhouse in Oak Brook, Illinois, on

Local 881 when he was hired as a field rep-
resentative. Due to his hard work and commit-
ment, Ron was promoted to field staff super-
visor in 1968 , and went on to become vice

His career continued to thrive, and in 1983,
Mr. Powell became president of Local 881. In
addition, he served as vice president of the
UFCW International. Currently, Ron serves as
vice president of the Illinois AFL–CIO and is a
trustee for the UFCW Midwest Pension and

rection, Local 881 has become a progressive
leader on behalf of its members in the areas
of work-site representation, membership serv-
ices, benefits, communication and activities.
In addition to his successful career, Ron has
dedicated much of his time and efforts to char-
itable endeavors for organizations including
the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Jack-
son Park Hospital, Little City Foundation, and
United Way of Illinois, to name a few. Mr.

amazing family. Ron and his beloved late wife,

IN MEMORY OF MRS. JOHNNIE LEE
BROWN COLLIER
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 15, 2019
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor a dedicated woman of
God, great wife, steadfast mother, and friend
of longstanding, Mrs. Johnnie Lee Brown Col-
lier. Sadly, Mrs. Collier passed away on De-
cember 27, 2018. Her funeral service was
held on Thursday, January 3, 2019 at 11 am
at the Fourth Street Missionary Baptist Church
in Columbus, Georgia.
Mrs. Johnnie Lee Brown Collier was born on
October 22, 1926, in Columbus, Georgia to
the union of Cleola Daniel Brown and John
Brown, Sr. She gave her life to Christ and was
baptized at an early age at Rosehill Memorial
Baptist Church. From that time on, God con-
tinued to be the center of her life until her
passing. She served as the Sunday School
Superintendent and Church Clerk at Rosehill
before moving her membership to the Fourth
Street Missionary Baptist Church in 1957. Her
first pastor at Fourth Street was the late Rev-
erend Henry Harris. Mrs. Collier paved the
way for others as she was the first Church
Secretary at Fourth Street. She was a natural
and gifted leader as she served in a variety of
leadership positions at Fourth Street to include
the Deacon’s Wives (she served as Chair-
person for two terms), PICCM Community
Leader in Zebulon Community, Women’s Day
Speaker, 1961, Chairperson of Program and
Pastoral Relations Committee, and was the
Roast and Toast Honoree n 1996.
Mrs. Collier was the epitome of a great wife
and mother. She married the late Deacon
Samuel Lee Collier on April 26, 1950. God
blessed this union for 34 years until Deacon
Collier’s untimely death on May 27, 1984. Six
children were born to this union to include two
sets of twins: Bernice Collier Collins, Bernard
Collier (deceased), Agnes Collier Averett,
Samuel Lee Collier, Jr., Michelle Collier
McClain, and Michael Collier. Fred Rogers
once said that, ‘‘It’s not so much what you
have in life that matters, It’s what we do with
what we have.’’ Mrs. Collier did a lot for others
with what she had. In addition to her own chil-
dren, she served as a mother figure to her sib-
lings and countless others she found in need
of guidance and a helping hand.
Former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm
once said that, ‘‘Service is the rent that we
pay for the space that we occupy here on this
earth.’’ Mrs. Collier paid her rent and she paid
it well. She served in a variety of community
organizations to include: Electric City Chapter
482 of the Order of the Eastern Stars (Worthy
Matron), Spencer High Alumni (Class of
1943), and she was a Muscogee County
Board of Elections Voting Precinct Manager
and she traveled to various state conventions
to further her knowledge of the voting process.
She was also an entrepreneur and a photog-
rapher. Her professional career took her to the
Medical Center, the Area Mental Health Clinic,
and the Enrichment Services Program Her be-
nevolence extended throughout the community
and she often used her influence and net-
working to help others to find gainful employ-
ment.
Madam Speaker, my wife Vivian and I,
along with the more than 730,000 constituents
of the Second Congressional District of Geor-
gia, salute and honor the life of Mrs. Johnnie
Lee Brown Collier. I ask my colleagues in the
House of Representatives to join us in extend-
ing our deepest condolences to Mrs. Collier’s
family during this time of bereavement. We
pray that they will be consoled and comforted
by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the
days, weeks and months ahead.

HON. TIM RYAN
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 15, 2019
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, today I rise to
remember the life of Craig M. Stephens, age
74, who passed away peacefully at his home
on August 28, 2018, surrounded by his family.
Craig was born in Columbus, Kansas in
1944, the son of two teachers. After moving to
Ohio in 1956, he attended Kent State Univer-
sity High School before graduating from Kent
State University in 1968. Craig was actively in-
volved in student government. He was elected
as the first Student Body President at KSU, he
revived the Democrat Club, and he was in-
vited to the White House. As an under-
graduate, he also managed John Carson’s
successful campaign for Kent Mayor and at
age 22 was named Safety Director for the City
of Kent from 1966 to 1968.
After graduation, Craig enlisted in the U.S.
Army and served as Special-Agent Military In-
telligence for 3 years. Following his honorable
discharge, Craig enrolled in Akron University
Law School where he began his career in the
law offices of Giulitto and Dickinson after grad-
uating in 1973. Soon after, he started his own
private practice where he represented the
rights of the working class specializing in
criminal law. Craig was well respected
throughout the region as an intelligent, straight
shooting attorney who always told it like it is.
Beyond his practice though, Craig volunteered
his time and expertise to organizations such
as the NAACP, Boys & Girls Club, NEOCAP,
Juvenile Detention Center, Portage Country
Community Action Council, and Waterloo
School District. Until his death, Craig contin-
ued to selflessly serve his community as the
Chairman of the Portage County Democratic
Party and Member and Chairman of the Por-
tage County Board of Elections.
Over 50 years of service, Craig played a
critical role in the campaigns of over 60 local,
state and national officials turning Portage
County into a stronghold for the Democratic
Party with his labeled ‘‘green machine’’ fea-
turing his candidates’ signature green political
signs. Labeled the ‘‘King Maker’’, Craig was
known for challenging the Democratic estab-
lishment and introducing new candidates into
the party. Over the same time period, Craig
took similar pride turning the family property in
Randolph from an old farm into a showpiece
that held every County Democratic Picnic
since the early 1990s, numerous wedding and
birthday events and kids camping overnights.
He could typically be found working in his barn
or out operating equipment, most recently
joined by his grandson, Xavier, who liked
nothing more than working on equipment with
his Grandpa.
Craig was married to the love of his life and
his better half, Ruth (Enlow), for 42 years. To-
gether they have two children, Justin Ste-
phens and Samantha (Hank) Stephens/
Brooks; and two grandchildren, Xavier and

Stranahan, Sr., formed the Champion Spark
Plug Co. The product was regarded as the fin-
est in the world during its time, and its de-
pendability contributed to U.S. victory in World
War II. Steve’s mother grew up in the Old
West End, her father a Toledo resident since
the 1850s and a prominent banker. She
helped found the Junior League of Toledo and
the League of Women Voters in Perrysburg.
Steve attended Maumee Valley Country Day
School, Brooks School in North Andover, and
Dartmouth College, where he majored in
music.
He served as a specialist in the 107th Ar-
mored Cavalry Regiment of the Ohio Army
National Guard.
Steve’s first job was in the marketing de-
partment of the legendary Champion Spark
Plug and where he worked his way up to
serve as the director of the company.
An entrepreneurial, creative business lead-
er, he found an opportunity to buy a small air-
port at Telegraph and Alexis roads, National
Airport, and operated National Flight Services,
which later moved to Toledo Express Airport
as a fixed-base operator. He became a dealer
of Beechcraft airplanes, tracing his affinity for
flight back to his father, who was a pioneer of
Champion’s spark plugs for aircraft.
Throughout the 1960s, Steve took the
mantra of community wide leadership and be-
came a rising civic leader, serving as presi-
dent of Downtown Toledo Associates, the To-
ledo Area Chamber of Commerce, and Civic
Pride Inc., which owned the Toledo Blades
hockey team.
In 1964, he, along with Ned Skeldon, Wil-
lard I. Webb III, and Henry Morse, arranged
for the return of the minor league baseball
team—the Mud Hens—to Toledo.
Steve joined Paul Block, Jr., Ned Skeldon,
and Thomas Anderson to form Clear Water
Inc. to campaign for cleaning up the Lake Erie
watershed. His firm, Riverview One, erected
Fiberglas Tower in downtown Toledo and he
was a leader in Arrowhead Park, a Maumee
business development.
A pianist himself, he took his love of music
and applied it to the Toledo Symphony, an in-
stitution his paternal grandmother, Marie Ce-
leste Stranahan, helped to found. Having
served as a long-time board member and
board president of the Toledo Symphony, he
stressed financial prudence and Steve and his
wife were recognized in 2015 by the Toledo
Symphony for their stewardship of the institu-
tion.
Steve’s overarching influence was most
impactful on the University of Toledo, having
served as chairman of the Board of Trustees
and as chairman of the University of Toledo
Foundation trustees. His insistence on having
an endowment fund set up for the University
and his leadership through much of the institu-
tional growth helped transform the University
of Toledo from a municipal school to a state
university.
Toledo has been blessed with his life as a
rare leader. Though an ‘‘Ivy League’’ success
story, he dedicated his substance to the ad-
vancement of life for all in the Toledo area.
Steve will ultimately be remembered for his
dedication not only to his family, but the family
of greater Toledo. On behalf of a grateful com-
munity, please let me offer his wife Ann An-
derson Stranahan, his children Frances Parry,
Abbot Stranahan Ward, Stephen ‘‘Josh’’
Stranahan and Daniel Stranahan, his eight
grandchildren and great-grandson, his sister
Mary Stranahan and brothers Michael,
George, and Duane ‘‘Pat’’ Stranahan, Jr., and
his many friends and associates our prayers
and hope that they find comfort in the wonder-
ful memories and lasting accomplishments of
Steve, and of his inspirational role in bettering
our way of life. His legacy lives on.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF FATHER JEROME LEDOUX
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND
OF LOUISIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 15, 2019
Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor the life and legacy of Father Jerome
LeDoux, a beloved Catholic priest who
pastored St. Augustine Catholic Church in
New Orleans. Father LeDoux passed away on
Monday, January 7, 2019 at the age of 88.
Father LeDoux was born in Lake Charles,
Louisiana, in 1930. He attended Sacred Heart
Elementary School and at the age of 13, he
traveled to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, to at-
tend high school at St. Augustine Seminary.
This was the only seminary in the nation that
trained African-American men for the priest-
hood. His spiritual training continued in Illinois
and Iowa, and be returned to St. Augustine
Seminary for further study.
Father LeDoux was ordained to the Catholic
priesthood on May 11, 1957. Following ordina-
tion, he studied for four years in Rome, where
he earned a master’s degree in sacred the-
ology and a doctorate in church law. He re-
turned to St. Augustine Seminary in Mis-
sissippi and taught theology and church law
for six years. In 1969, he began teaching at
Xavier University in New Orleans and contin-
ued in this role for more than a decade.
In 1981, Father LeDoux became pastor of
St. Martin de Porres Church in Praire View,
Texas. He moved back to Louisiana in 1984 to
lead Baton Rouge’s St. Paul the Apostle
Church. And in 1990, his 16-year pastorship
began at St. Augustine Parish in New Orleans.
In 2006, Father LeDoux accepted an as-
signment from his order, the Society of Divine
Word, to become pastor of Our Mother of
Mercy Parish in Fort Worth, Texas. Since
1969, Father LeDoux would write a weekly
column entitled ‘‘Reflections on Life,’’ syn-
dicated in several Catholic weeklies, Louisiana
Weekly in New Orleans, and Seacoast Echo
in Bay St. Louis.
Father LeDoux loved the city and the people
of New Orleans. His legacy will forever be a
part of the city and his dedication to commu-
nity embodies the spirit of New Orleans. We
cannot match the sacrifices made by Father
LeDoux, but surely, we can try to match his
sense of service. We cannot match his cour-
age, but we can strive to match his devotion.
Father LeDoux survivor’s include a sister
and two brothers.
Madam Speaker, I celebrate the life and
legacy of Father Jerome LeDoux.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE SESQUI-
CENTENNIAL OF JOHNSON CITY,
TENNESSEE
HON. DAVID P. ROE
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 15, 2019
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Madam
Speaker, today I join in paying tribute to the
sesquicentennial of my hometown of Johnson
city, Tennessee.
The City of Johnson City was founded in
Northeast Tennessee, where three railroads—
East Tennessee and Western North Carolina
Railroad, Clinchfield Railroad, and Southern
Railway—converged, holding its first election
on Jan. 3, 1870, with 60 registered voters.
Voters elected entrepreneur Henry Johnson,
owner of Johnson’s Depot, to serve as the
City’s first mayor. The City charter defined the
city limits as being the area within a half-mile
radius of Johnson’s Depot, the city’s first com-
mercial business. Johnson’s Depot operated
as a railway depot, freight station, and post of-
fice, and also served as a hotel, restaurant,
and store.
The Watauga Tannery, the city’s first major
industry, was established in November 1883
covering 130 acres and employing as many as
300 men. Today, Johnson City boasts a di-
verse economy led by healthcare and edu-
cation.
The Mountain Branch of the National Home
for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers opened in
1903. Now known as the James H. Quillen VA

Medical Center, it serves more than 170,000
veterans living in a 41-county area of Ten-
nessee, Virginia, and Kentucky.
The City’s first professional hospital, Appa-
lachian Hospital and School of Nursing,
opened in 1921 with the support of citizens
who funded half the cost of the facility. John-
son City has become home to three major
hospitals—Johnson City Medical Center,
Franklin Woods Community Hospital, and
Niswonger Children’s Hospital.
In 1911, the teacher-training institute known
as East Tennessee State Normal School,
predecessor of East Tennessee State Univer-
sity, was founded. Today, as the fourth largest
university in the State of Tennessee, ETSU
also includes the highly regarded Quillen Col-
lege of Medicine and Gatton College of Phar-
macy.
In 1939 the Johnson City Board of Commis-
sioners adopted the charter that established
the council-manager form of government,
under which it operates today. Through a col-
laborative process of elected officials working
closely with citizens, Johnson City has created
a city recognized by a variety of publications
as a great place to live.
Johnson City has operated its own Transit
System since 1979 and established Ten-
nessee’s first citywide curbside recycling pro-
gram in 1989. Additionally, the city has 18
parks, 40 athletic fields and a host of multi-use
trails. Johnson City is also home to Freedom
Hall Civic Center, Memorial Park Community
Center, a large public library and a robust sen-
ior services program.
Although Johnson City’s local economy in-
cludes national and regional companies, it
also embodies the entrepreneurial spirit of
Henry Johnson, supporting countless small
business owners who operate in city limits,
particularly the downtown area.
The City of Johnson City, which kicked off
its Sesquicentennial on Jan. 3, 2019, has be-
come a thriving community of more than
66,000 residents with city limits expanded to
43.3 square miles. I look forward to what the
next 150 years holds for Johnson City.

GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE FAIR
TREATMENT ACT OF 2019
SPEECH OF
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, January 11, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise in
support of S. 24, the Government Employee
Fair Treatment Act of 2019. Saturday marked
the longest federal government shutdown in
history. It is true that we have been able to get
back pay for federal employees who were fur-
loughed or who worked without pay for every
shutdown in recent history. However, Con-
gress has acted not out of the kindness of its
heart with respect to workers who worked
without pay; we acted because, under the
Constitution, specifically the Fifth and Thir-
teenth Amendments, people cannot be made
to work without compensation, particularly if
they are federal employees. That would be a
constitutional violation, and Congress knows it,
and that is why we provide back pay to those
employees who are forced to work during a
shutdown without pay. We must also protect
those who were not allowed to work during the
shutdown, but, nevertheless, still incurred all
their normal living expenses. We cannot be
sure that the necessary appropriations will be
forthcoming, especially in a government where
one party controls both the Presidency and
the Senate. The Government Employee Fair
Treatment Act of 2019, guaranteeing back
pay, is an essential safeguard that federal em-
ployees are due.
At the same time, furloughed federal con-
tract employees, who often preform the same
jobs as federal employees, are not being paid.
Therefore, I have introduced a bill that would
grant back pay to low-wage federally con-
tracted retail, food, custodial and security serv-
ice workers who are furloughed during the cur-
rent and any other federal government shut-
down this fiscal year (fiscal year 2019).
Polls have consistently shown that Ameri-
cans oppose this shutdown and are anxious
for the president and for Congress to get on
with the essential tasks of governing. The
Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of
2019 will operate as an IOU to federal em-
ployees who deserve no less, but, indeed,
much more.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF
DONALD F. GUERRA
HON. TIM RYAN
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 15, 2019
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life of my cousin Donald F. Guerra,
age 73, who passed away peacefully on
Thursday, December 13, 2018, at the Hospice
of The Valley Hospice House in Poland.
Donnie was the life of our family parties. He
was the family member who remembered and
told all the best family stories. He captured the
love and humor of our Italian immigrant family.
He treasured our family and was always there
for all of us. He helped on my first campaigns
by getting family and friends to ride their mo-
torcycles in local parades wearing my cam-
paign tee shirts. He was a staunch Democrat
and a Union man through and through.
He was born February 11, 1945 in Warren,
Ohio to Fabian and Rita Bologna Guerra. He
graduated from Niles McKinley High School in
1964 and following that, Embry-Riddle Aero-
nautical University in Daytona, Florida. Upon
completing his university studies, Don was
employed as a journeyman pipe fitter at WCI,
Thomas Steel and Delphi Packard and retired
in 2000. He also owned and operated
Guerra’s Dental Lab in Youngstown for 10
years and was a flight instructor for 50 years.
Don was a United States Army veteran,
serving with the 101st Airborne Division in
Vietnam for 13 months and then returning to
the United States to serve at NORAD in the
Cheyenne Mountain Complex.
He was a member of Our Lady of Mount
Carmel Parish in Niles and a Trumbull County
Democratic Precinct Committee Member. Don
was an avid Green Bay Packers and New
York Yankees fan and enjoyed golfing, riding
his motorcycle, spending time with his grand-
daughters.
He will be sadly missed by his wife, Donna
Stabile Guerra, whom he married November
23, 1972; his son Donald Guerra and his wife
Andria and their children Sophia and Gabriella
of Niles; David Guerra and his wife Cathy, and
their children Macey and Anna of McDonald; a
brother Fabian Guerra, Jr. and his wife Nancy
of Pasadena, Maryland; a sister Nina Miller
and her husband Jim of Amelia Island, Florida;
and several nieces and nephews. He was pre-
ceded in death by his parents.
We will miss Cooge. Life just won’t be the
same without him.

Rhonda, is a retired librarian with the Ascen-
sion Parish School Board with 40 years of
service. Her father, Allen, is a retired profes-
sional football player. Ms. Dunbar is a dual-
degreed scientist and engineer with 19 years
of experience in the areas of process and
plant design, research and development, prod-
uct quality management, and environmental
regulation.
In 2013, Ms. Dunbar used her experience
from her professional career as a senior sci-
entist and process engineer to form the
STEMS GEMS Mentoring Project, which high-
lights Girls Excelling in Math and Science.
Through this program, Ms. Dunbar mentors
girls who excel in math and science and en-
courages them to pursue careers and ad-
vanced degrees in STEM majors where
women and minorities are underrepresented.
This program has mentored more than 650
girls in conjunction with the Ascension Parish
School Board, with six participants receiving
Student of the Year distinctions. The program
has since expanded to several surrounding
parishes including Iberville, St. Helena, St.
Charles, St. James, St. John the Baptist and
East Baton Rouge.
In addition to recently being selected to be
a part of the 2019 Baton Rouge Area Cham-
ber’s Leadership Class and the highly com-
petitive Greater Baton Rouge Business Re-
port’s Executive Leadership Academy, Ms.
Dunbar was appointed to serve on the Re-
gional Council for STAR (Sexual Trauma
Awareness and Response) and the Advisory
Board for Emerge Louisiana. The 2017 LSU
Esprit de Femme Honoree was also selected
to serve as the 2018 LSU Esprit de Femme
Honorary Chair this past Spring for her contin-
ued professional accolades and community
endeavors.
Ms. Dunbar also serves on the executive
Board of Directors for the Ascension Fund,
Volunteer Ascension, the Louisiana Coalition
for Healthier Communities, APEX STEM Colle-
giate Academy, the chartering chapter of The
National Coalition of 100 Black Women for
Metropolitan Baton Rouge, and the Arc of As-
cension.
During Ms. Dunbar’s tenure as President-
Elect for the Arc of Ascension, she was instru-
mental in helping the Arc raise over $100,000
last year for its annual Dancing for a Cause
fundraiser.
Madam Speaker, I celebrate the work that
Ms. Alsie R. Dunbar has done to make her
community a better place.

DISSENTING VIEWS TO THE AC-
TIVITY REPORT OF THE COM-
MITTEE ON ENERGY AND COM-
MERCE OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE
ONE HUNDRED FIFTEENTH CON-
GRESS
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR.
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 15, 2019
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, today I in-
clude in the RECORD Dissenting Views to the
Activity Report of the Committee on Energy
and Commerce of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives for the One Hundred Fifteenth
Congress (Activity Report). The Activity Re-
port, which was filed by the Republican major-
ity on January 2, 2019, should have included
these dissenting views, however, they were
not included. I am taking this action to ensure
that the House Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee Democrats can exercise their right
under House Rule XI to submit these dis-
senting views so that they are made part of
the official House record.
House Rule XI gives the majority party au-
thority and the responsibility for setting our
committee’s agenda and to determine which
jurisdictional areas and matters (and the ex-
tent to which) it will oversee or investigate.
The Energy and Commerce Committee
marked up and reported out important biparti-
sanship legislation in the 115th Congress, like
H.R. 6, H.R. 304, H.R. 931, H.R. 1320, H.R.
2430, H.R. 2345, H.R. 3387, H.R. 5333, and
H.R. 6378. Each of these bills was considered
pursuant to regular order at every major legis-
lative stage and should be seen as being dis-
plays of some of our greater legislative ac-
complishments.
We would have been more successful as a
committee this Congress had our Republican
majority believed in and followed regular order
more consistently. Regular order was nowhere
to be found at the beginning of the 115th Con-
gress. Republican House leaders and com-
mittee chairs exiled regular order at the start
of the 115th Congress to deliver on their par-
ty’s promise to repeal and replace the Afford-
able Care Act as soon as possible after as-
suming unified government following the 2016
Presidential and federal elections.
Less than two months from the Committee’s
organization at the beginning of 2017, our
Committee’s Republican majority hurriedly no-
ticed for full Committee markup a draft print, ti-
tled the American Health Care Act (AHCA).
The AHCA was subsequently introduced and
numbered as H.R. 1628. As we noted in our
Minority Views to that bill’s legislative report
that accompanied it to the House floor:
Despite the wide-ranging, serious implica-
tions of this legislation for the health and fi-
nancial security of all Americans, the Com-
mittee did not hold a single hearing on the
details and effect of the legislation. Notably,
stakeholders have not had the ability to
weigh in on the impacts of the bill to the
health care system. In fact, the Committee
received letters from hospitals, doctors, and
patient and advocacy groups all outlining
their significant concerns with the legisla-
tion. Additionally, despite Speaker Ryan’s
claims that the bill would be considered
through regular order and through a trans-
parent process, the repeal bill was drafted in
secret and introduced less than two days be-
fore markup.
The minority is deeply concerned by the
decision to proceed to markup without first
receiving the views of the CBO on the impact
of this legislation on health insurance cov-
erage, costs, and the federal budget.
This exercise, which signaled that Com-
mittee Republicans might apply regular order
sporadically and unpredictably, set the tone for
the 115th Congress.
Bills that the Republican majority chose not
to put through regular order were appreciably
more partisan and controversial. These in-
cluded H.R. 1628 and other troublesome bills
to change the Clean Power Plan standards or
to amend the Clean Air Act, the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), the Federal Com-
munications Commission (FCC), and the Fed-
eral Energy Regulatory Commission regula-
tions and standards. Other Republican prac-
tices reflected in legislation acted on by the
Committee, which Democrats saw and op-
posed, included attacks on funding and pro-
grams that promote and protect Democratic
priorities, such as the Prevention and Public
Health Fund.
Committee Democrats also took issue at
times with bills that relied on weak justifica-
tions and policies to support Congressional
action, change, or clarification to existing stat-
utes and federal programs that would weaken
environmental and consumer health, public
safety, and privacy protections. These legisla-
tive measures implemented policies and
amended regulations to create loopholes and
other compliance safe harbors. Our Repub-
lican majority acted on legislation that rolled
back environmental and other consumer
health and safety protections by moving fur-
ther into the future well-noticed compliance
deadlines for EPA new source performance
standards applying to new residential wood
and hydronic heaters and forced-air furnaces
as well as national emission standards for
hazardous air pollutants for brick and struc-
tural clay products and clay ceramics manu-
facturing and power plants using coal refuse
facilities under the Clean Air Act. While some
of these bills and amendments were intended
to provide more legal and business certainty
to industry; a good deal of them extended
more regulatory relief than needed to properly
balance the respective interests of all actors
and stakeholders.
The Committee appropriately exercised its
jurisdictional discretion and prerogative at
times to convene very important oversight
hearings. For example, the Republican major-
ity conducted formal oversight to raise critically
important questions about Facebook’s data
protection and security practices and policies,
and why those practices were insufficient to
prohibit and prevent Cambridge Analytica from
collecting and using Facebook user and other
platform data to influence 2016 Presidential
election voters. The Republican majority, how-
ever, suppressed its oversight duties and re-
sponsibilities to call more fervently upon the
Trump Administration and the Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS) to appear
before the Committee and explain its role in
relation to the Administration’s ‘‘zero toler-
ance’’ policy. As a result, the Ranking Member
of the Committee, Rep. FRANK PALLONE, JR.
introduced H. Res. 982, a resolution of inquiry
(RoI), requesting President Trump and direct-
ing the Secretary of HHS to transmit certain
information and records to the House of Rep-
resentative relating to the separation of chil-
dren from their parents or guardians in con-
nection with the President’s ‘‘zero tolerance’’
policy.
In his dissenting views to the report cov-
ering the Committee’s RoI proceeding, Rank-
ing Member PALLONE asserted that the Com-
mittee should have acted more quickly and
decisively to understand and to offer its views
regarding the family border separation crisis:
My resolution of inquiry is ripe for action
. . . For better, far more than worse, family
unification is vital to all of [us] as individ-
uals and to our physical and mental health
and overall well-being. Regardless of one’s
citizenship status or the country from which
they are migrating to the United States,
happy and stable families are undeniably es-
sential to becoming and staying healthy. For
that reason alone, separating children from

their families, regardless of whose policy it
is or the objectives behind that policy, is
suspect on its face and must be balanced by
(our thorough) input, as a separate and co-
equal branch of the federal government. Our
Committee should not allow or tolerate fur-
ther delay but this Administration in pro-
viding answers to our questions or soliciting
our advice and reactions regarding this
unabated crisis. In order to perform our
sworn duties as elected representatives and
leaders, we must convene an oversight hear-
ing as soon as possible. For these reasons, H.
Res. 982 should have been favorably reported.
While our Committee continued its important
bipartisan traditions this Congress, in the
115th Congress the Republican majority failed
to conduct any legitimate oversight of the
Trump Administration, failing to hold them ac-
countable for the cost of their policies to un-
dermine critical health care, environmental and
consumer protections. Republicans also failed
to prioritize the lives of everyday Americans.
Energy and Commerce Committee Democrats
pursue policies that help everyday people by
building a stronger economy, creating more
good paying jobs, and protecting consumers
from skyrocketing costs that make it increas-
ingly difficult to make ends meet.
