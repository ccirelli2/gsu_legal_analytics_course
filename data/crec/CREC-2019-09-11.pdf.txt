AND STILL I RISE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise on this 9/11, a day
that will live in the annals of history
eternally, a day when there were more
questions than answers, a day when we
thought that our country was—and, in-
deed, what we thought was correct—
under assault.
I remember the day because I was at
work, and as the judge of a small
claims justice court, we were so moved
by what was happening that we paused
to sing God Bless America. I remember
at least one person sobbing. It was a
day when people within that courtroom
were faced with uncertainties unlike
we had seen before, a day when all of
our first responders were challenged.
But allow me, please, for just a mo-
ment, to talk and say a few words
about those who were there at the site
of the Twin Towers.
We could see on television the cloud
of dust as it started to emerge and set-
tle, people rushing, bodies covered. It
was intuitively obvious to the most
casual observer that this was not a
place to run to. As a matter of fact,
you could see people running away.
But there were those who took their
duties and responsibilities seriously,
and as others were rushing away, as
fear would have us do, they were rush-
ing in. These were the people, many of
whom lost their lives trying to save
the lives of others. These were the peo-
ple, many of whom still suffer today
because they were bound by duty to do
that which most of us would not.
These are the people whom we must
never forget. Their lives have been
changed and altered forever. But we
have a duty and a responsibility here
to share our thoughts and our feelings
with them, but also to make sure we
take care of their health issues.
There is something to be said about
this term, ‘‘in the line of duty.’’ Until
you have had the opportunity to visit
one of the memorial services, it just
may not impact you as it can. It will
never impact me the way it impacts
the family members.
But I want this country to know that
those who lost their lives in the line of
duty on that day will never be forgot-
ten, and those who served and still
serve will always be remembered.
So I take this moment for my per-
sonal privilege, and I will lower my
head for a moment of silent prayer.
God bless the United States of Amer-
ica.
COMMEMORATING THE 18TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE SEPTEMBER 11
ATTACKS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today, on the
18th anniversary of September 11, 2001,
to reflect on the events of that fateful
day and to honor the lives lost and the
heroes that united us.
At 8:46 a.m., American Airlines
Flight 11 roared over Lower Manhattan
and into Tower 1 of the World Trade
Center. Shortly after, Flight 175 struck
Tower 2.
Our country was under attack. Many
of us could never imagine such evil
taking place in our own backyard.
The terror did not stop in New York
City. The Pentagon, center of our
Armed Forces and national defense and
our Nation’s Capital, was also a target
of evil. Flight 77 crashed into the Pen-
tagon at 9:38 a.m. It was a turning
point in our history and changed the
way we would view the world forever.
The fourth plane hijacked that day
was United 93, crashing into a field in
Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
Here in the Capitol, as you exit the
north side of the rotunda, a plaque dis-
plays the names of the 40 passengers
and crew of United 93.
One of those aboard was Flight At-
tendant Sandra Bradshaw. Sandra had
always wanted to be a flight attendant
and was living out that dream, trav-
eling and meeting new people.
At 9:30 a.m. on 9/11, she called her
husband and told him that United 93
had been hijacked. She said the crew
and passengers had decided to try to
take back the plane. Their sacrifice
saved countless lives, and I can’t help
but think they may have saved this
very building where we sit today from
destruction.
Our country’s fight against terrorism
did not happen on a battlefield on the

other side of the world but over the
skies of Pennsylvania, New York, and
Virginia by ordinary American citi-
zens.
The courage and bravery of Flight 93
was not the only heroism on display
that day. Firefighters, police officers,
and first responders jumped into action
without hesitation. When planes
crashed, they ran in. When fires ig-
nited, they ran in. When buildings col-
lapsed, they ran in. Their courage
never wavered.
We will never forget the lives lost
and must always remember the her-
oism that was shown. And while we
cannot bring our loved ones back, we
can honor their memory through acts
of service.
To maintain the spirit of unity and
compassion that stem from the at-
tacks, every year our country pro-
claims September 11 as Patriot Day. It
is a great way to honor the souls we
lost and pay tribute to all who sac-
rificed their lives.
As President Bush said when he ad-
dressed the Nation: ‘‘Terrorist attacks
can shake the foundations of our big-
gest buildings, but they cannot touch
the foundation of America. These at-
tacks shattered steel, but they cannot
dent the steel of American resolve.’’
f
COMMEMORATING THE 18TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE SEPTEMBER 11
ATTACKS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS) for 5 minutes.
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker,
September 11, 2001, is one of those days
when everyone of age can remember
where they were and what they were
doing when the first plane hit.
I was a police commander assigned to
the Orlando International Airport. It
appeared to be a normal day, and then
the events unfolded. The planes hit.
The towers collapsed. The Pentagon
burned. The passengers of Flight 93
mounted their heroic resistance.
It appeared time stood still as the
world watched the results and the ac-
tions of the hijackers, evil men who set
out to attack America, to kill Ameri-
cans. But they could never have killed
the idea of America. You see, that idea
belongs to us. It will endure as long as
we continue to believe in it, to perfect
it, and to make it worth fighting for.
2,977 lives, 343 firefighters, 23 New
York police officers, and 37 Port Au-
thority officers—they took much from
us that day.
As a mother, I think of the roughly
100 babies who will turn 18 this year
having never known their fathers.
Today, I remember the passengers
and crew. I remember the first respond-
ers who rushed into fire and smoke,
dust and rubble in a desperate fight to
save whomever they could; who worked
for weeks on end, breathing deadly par-
ticles, trying to find survivors, or at
least identify the dead; heroes who died
that day or from illnesses contracted
from the search, rescue, recovery; he-
roes who died as they lived, in service
to others, who believed in service above
self. These men and women didn’t just
save lives; they defined what it means
to be a hero for a generation.
On the day of the worst terrorist at-
tack on American soil, our first re-
sponders showed us the best of us. I am
relieved that, earlier this year, Con-
gress passed lifetime funding for the 9/
11 Victims Compensation Fund.
Yes, evil men took much from us
that day; but the heart and soul of
America, the courage and tenacity, the
ability to endure and to stand no
enemy can take away from us.
The work of caring for those individ-
uals who answered the call that day
must go on, just as our work will go on
to secure our Nation, to ensure that we
will never again suffer the injury we
did on that morning.
But today, on September 11, we pause
from that work to remember and to
honor the victims and to acknowledge
the service of 9/11 is not just something
to be memorialized, but to be emu-
lated, to put service above self. May we
stand united and serve in the people’s
House with courage, devotion, gal-
lantry, compassion, and grace.
f
COMMEMORATING THE 18TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE SEPTEMBER 11
ATTACKS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Virginia (Mr. RIGGLEMAN) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Speaker,
18 years ago, America experienced the
worst act of terrorism in its history.
Nearly 3,000 people were killed, with
many others in emergency services and
law enforcement suffering long-lasting
health complications, sometimes re-
sulting in death.
September 11, 2001, a day none of us
will ever forget, had a deep and lasting
impact on the lives of all Americans. I
was one of the thousands who answered
the call to serve and to hunt down
those responsible.
When I woke on that tragic day, I
was serving in the United States Air
Force as an intelligence officer at
Mountain Home Air Force Base in
Idaho with the 366th Air Expeditionary
Wing, 34th Bomb Squadron—the B–1
bombers. I was and am a proud Moun-
tain Home Gunfighter. Our squadron
deployed almost immediately as the
on-call wing. By early October, I and
my brothers and sisters in arms were
mission planning the first bombing
runs into Afghanistan.
I still remember the morning of Sep-
tember 11. Memories come to my mind
as vividly as if they were yesterday:
buttoning the buttons on my uniform
when my wife yelled at me up the
stairs that a plane had hit the World
Trade Center in New York; a phone call
seconds later that I, in no uncertain
terms, needed to get my butt into the
squadron to brief my commander on
the situation and start loading
Conexes; working through the night
while the base was in lockdown and
much of the country was in a fog; try-
ing to answer questions from my young
daughter, wife, and friends about what
was happening.
You are seeing my daughter, here, as
I came home from deployment.
My memories are not unique, and
every American has a different view-
point on what happened that day.
Some lost friends or family, and the
tragedy we as a nation felt that day
should not be forgotten.
But the impact of those attacks was
not limited to that day, and history
will write that heroic Americans re-
sponded with valor and bravery.
One of the most heinous acts ever
committed on American soil did not
bring us down but brought us together.
In the words of former President
George W. Bush: ‘‘One of the worst
days in America’s history saw some of
the bravest acts in Americans’ his-
tory.’’
Less than 24 hours after the first
plane hit the towers in New York, de-
ployment orders came. I still remem-
ber that feeling, standing on the
tarmac and then watching from the
plane as my three daughters, all
younger than 10 years old, waved small
American flags from down below. I was
deployed on Active Duty and would be
spending the next weeks planning
bombing runs on Afghanistan to re-
spond to these attacks.
Our Armed Forces are asked to make
sacrifices; leaving their families is
often one of them. But after 9/11, when
so many Americans had sacrificed so
much more, my brothers and sisters in
arms were willing to make that sac-
rifice. Inspired by the heroism of so
many firefighters, first responders, law
enforcement, and citizens who an-
swered the call, we knew that America
would emerge stronger.
Eighteen years later, we remember
the heroes of 9/11, honor their sacrifice,
and admire their patriotism. Their
memories will last for us forever be-
cause we will never forget what they
gave us, heroic Americans who an-
swered the call.
I was proud to serve with heroes like
General Seve Wilson, Bull, Bullet, Eli,
Scar, Jimbo, Rooster, Mongo, IROC,
Stainless, Lost, Krenkle, Frengle, Ser-
geant Lowery, Migo, Psycho, Sassy,
Tank, Rachel, Linda Vadnais,
Atteberry, and so many more. From
Ground Zero in New York to the Pen-
tagon and across the country, Amer-
ican heroes answered the call, and we
are forever in their debt.
God bless the United States of Amer-
ica.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7601
September 11, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise
today on the 18th anniversary of the
September 11 terrorist attack to honor
the nearly 3,000 individuals, brave men
and women who lost their lives. Most
Americans remember where they were
during that day. There have been few
times in our Nation’s history that we
have faced such an atrocity. And the
effects are still being felt today.
But instead of shrinking in the shad-
ow of such adversity, we rose to the
challenge and came together to help
one another. We became a Nation of
one. But it also has changed our Nation
and the world that we live in today for-
ever, the way we work, the way we
view our security.
This past July, I was pleased that the
House and Senate with the President
came together to reauthorize the 9/11
Victim’s Compensation Fund for police
and firefighters, first responders who
answered the call after the attack in
New York and Washington, D.C. These
heroic men and women deserve all the
help we can give them, and we must
never forget September 11, 2001. We
must remember 18 years ago today
when we were all one as Americans. We
need that more today than ever before.
HONORING DAVID HUERTA
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, in my
home State in the San Joaquin Valley
we recently lost a wonderful indi-
vidual, a leader who I would like to
honor today, Fresno State Police Chief
David Huerta. David was loved by all.
He passed away in mid-August after
serving honorably in that position for
15 years.
A lifelong resident of Fresno County,
Chief Huerta dedicated his life to serv-
ing his community by teaching and
providing public safety as a police offi-
cer. During his career he was recog-
nized as Officer of the Year. And Fres-
no State President Joseph Castro said
David served with integrity, even in
the most challenging of situations.
David will be greatly missed by his
wife Cynthia, his four children and
three grandchildren. It is with great re-
spect that I ask my colleagues today to
join in honoring Police Chief David
Huerta.
RECOGNIZING CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY,
FRESNO AND UC MERCED
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I would
like to take this moment to recognize
the recent achievements of two out-
standing universities in my district,
California State University, Fresno
and UC Merced University of Cali-
fornia.
According to the U.S. News and
World Report’s 2020 Best College
rankings, Fresno State University, my
alma mater, ranked number three in
graduation rate performance for public
universities.
UC Merced made the biggest leap of
all on the college list. They ranked
number one in the Nation for student
outcomes, including number one in
outperforming expected graduation
rates.
Both of these universities currently
have over 70 percent of their student
body who are the first in their family
ever to attend a university. These uni-
versities are doing what a higher edu-
cation should be doing for all Ameri-
cans. Go Bulldogs. Go Bobcats.
CONGRESS MUST ACT ON GUN LEGISLATION
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I would
like to rise to urge Senate Majority
Leader MITCH MCCONNELL to keep his
word and act on gun safety legislation.
Every day it seems that there is cov-
erage of another shooting on the news.
Americans are just frustrated. Since
Congress has begun their district work
period in July there have been four
high-profile shootings in this country.
Those shootings resulted in the death
of 51 Americans and over 90 that were
injured. The threat to public safety
today is simply unacceptable in our
country.
In February, the House passed two
key gun violence pieces of legislation.
It has been nearly over 200 days since
we passed these bills, but nothing has
been done in the Senate. Despite the
countless Americans who have lost
their lives in these senseless shootings,
including children, Leader MCCONNELL
has refused to bring these up for de-
bate. We should be doing our work and
trying to provide gun safety for all
Americans.
After the shootings in Dayton and El
Paso, the American public has de-
manded action. The overwhelming ma-
jority of Americans want us to take
commonsense action to provide better
public safety. So Leader MCCONNELL
said he would be doing just that. I
think it is time that we hold him to his
word.
This Congress must act. The Presi-
dent should take the leadership, ensur-
ing we can do everything we can to
protect Americans throughout our
land.

REMEMBERING 9/11
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to remember the nearly 3,000
people who were killed on this day in
2001. At dawn, September 11, 2001, was a
morning like every other, that is until
everything changed. Terrorists, who
were intent on destroying our country
and our way of life attacked.
But through this tragedy we saw our
country unite. We saw unmatched
courage and bravery from our first re-
sponders, servicemembers, and every-
day citizens. Now, 18 years later, we
find ourselves with a new generation
that did not experience the horrors of
that day. They only know a post-9/11
world. That makes it all the more im-
portant that we teach them what hap-
pened that day, honor the victims, and
discuss the impact those terrorist at-
tacks have had on our world.
But today, we remember. Today, we
pray. Today, we honor Americans of
every background who, in the after-
math of that fateful day, united under
our flag, bound together by a sense of
unflappable courage, duty, and patriot-
ism.

HONORING SCOTT KIMBRIEL
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. TRONE) for 5 minutes.
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor my good friend, Scott
Kimbriel, who died on August 12 after a
year-long struggle with prostate can-
cer.
I met Scott sometime before kinder-
garten and we stayed close for almost
60 years. He used to come over and
work on our farm while we grew up,
and over many decades our friendship
remained strong as we moved across
the country.
At his core, Scott was a gifted entre-
preneur and businessman. He was able
to learn from his mistakes and relent-
lessly marched forward. He was a giver,
able to exercise so much compassion
with absolutely no strings attached be-
cause it was simply the right thing to
do for his friends. I was better off for
having known Scott.
In 2019 the American Cancer Society
estimates over 174,000 people will be di-
agnosed with prostate cancer. Over
31,000 of those diagnosed will die from
the disease. I, myself, am a cancer sur-
vivor.
Right now the National Cancer Insti-
tute, which is located in my district is
working on prevention, detection, and
treatment of prostate and other can-
cers. But we are leaving so much on
the table. We need to invest more in re-
search. We need to invest more in inno-
vative solutions that could save lives
like Scott’s.
In Congress we must be determined
and unified to eradicate cancer and
eliminate the heartache that it brings
so many families across our great
country.
Scott Kimbriel was a special person,
and it hurts knowing I can no longer
pick up the phone and hear Scott’s ever
cheerful voice answer, ‘‘DT.’’ But in-
stead of looking in the rearview mir-
ror, Scott would want us to look out
the front window thinking about how
we could support those in the future
who might suffer from this horrible
disease.
I know I am committed to this fight,
and I ask my colleagues to join me in
this fight.

Men and women, young and old were
stolen from their families, their com-
munities, and our country.
As she always has during our darkest
hour, this country came together in a
courageous way. We were one people
uniting to heal a terrible wound. May
we all strive today to soon find that
same unity—now, not just in times of
tragedy. Americans and her people will
be all the better for it.
May God bless the memories of those
who died on September 11, and may
God bless this great country.
STRIVING TO MAKE KANSAS A BETTER PLACE TO
LIVE
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker,
last week I completed my tour of all
105 counties in Kansas. I enjoyed meet-
ing folks of all backgrounds and learn-
ing about their passions, concerns and
what they need their representatives in
Washington to do to deliver for Kansas.
From Dodge to Topeka, Pratt to
Leavenworth, the message I heard from
Kansans is they want their way of live
preserved. They want their representa-
tives to fight alongside President
Trump, reduce Washington red tape,
and advocate for new and fair trade
agreements so our farmers can feed the
world.
For the most part, Kansans just want
a decent job with a good wage and a
fair shot at the American Dream. Aside
from the safety and security afforded
to them, most would otherwise be
happy to not have Washington involved
in our day-to-day lives.
Despite folks’ disagreements on some
issues, Kansans are a people who large-
ly agree on the importance of faith,
community, and hard work.
After completing this tour of all 105
Kansas counties, I have a greater ap-
preciation for the challenges of Kan-
sans of all walks of life. Each conversa-
tion was an opportunity to hear an in-
dividual’s story about the burden of se-
curing affordable healthcare for a loved
one, finding good workers to grow a
small farm or business, finding a home
to raise their family in, and protecting
and nurturing the communities they
love and cherish.
I don’t have all the answers or quick
fixes for our challenges, but I will con-
tinue to strive to make Kansas a better
place to live. Each day I am blessed
with the opportunity to represent Kan-
sas in Congress. I carry that message
in my heart, that we are the bread-
basket of the world and home to some
of the best, hardest working and most
decent people on Earth.
AMERICANS MUST REJECT A RADICAL SOCIALIST
AGENDA
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker,
last week a socialist senator seeking
higher office proposed increasing abor-
tions across the world as a way to slow
population growth and combat climate
change. Worse yet, he directly stated
that he wanted U.S. taxpayers to pay
for these abortions. As many Kansans
are coming to understand, this is just
one of the many disgraceful and dis-
turbing socialist agendas increasingly
embraced by my colleagues across the
aisle.
There is no policy proposal at present
which more represents the Democrats’
quest for total control over every as-
pect of our lives than the Green New
Deal. This deal is nothing more than a
rebranding of overwhelming govern-
ment control under the guise of envi-
ronmental stewardship. Just ask its
sponsor’s former chief of staff who said,
‘‘It wasn’t originally a climate thing at
all. . . . we really think of it as a how
to change the entire economy thing.’’
The Green New Deal demands we
completely overhaul our energy and
transportation infrastructure, which
would kill the jobs of millions of Amer-
icans working in the oil, and gas indus-
try, manufacturing, and aviation in-
dustries, to name a few. The plan
would crush Kansas beef producers by
placing a hefty tax on our farms with
estimates costing nearly $2,000 per cow.
The Green New Deal would be the
greatest centralization of power in the
hands of Washington elites in Amer-
ican history.
But destroying America’s means of
energy and food production isn’t all
this radical socialist agenda seeks to
do; as we learned recently, the new
Democrat party’s to-do list includes
everything from banning private
health insurance to plastic straws na-
tionwide, positions numerous Demo-
cratic candidates for President have al-
ready endorsed.
Democrats want to dictate what you
can drink, how you drink it, what you
can eat, and where you can work, and
what healthcare you can have, all
while you are forced to pay for abor-
tions overseas. And don’t forget about
the proposed 90 percent tax rates on
Americans either.
We must emphatically reject this
radical socialist agenda and work in-
stead to implement innovative solu-
tions to provide for greater prosperity
and equality for all. Our children and
our grandchildren’s future and the fu-
ture of Kansas and this great Nation
depend upon it.

MAKE HOMEOWNERSHIP EQUALLY
AVAILABLE TO ALL
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. RUSH) for 5 minutes.
Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to address how racially discrimi-
natory housing policy has contributed
to the unjust racial wealth gap in our
Nation.
Currently, Madam Speaker, 72 per-
cent of White households own their
own homes, while just 41 percent of
Black households do. The roots of this
disparity can be traced to the discrimi-
natory practices implemented by the
Federal Housing Authority, which re-
sulted in only 2 percent of federally
backed loans being issued to African
Americans between 1934 and 1968. This
was a supra-classic form of kinematic,
organic, and institutional racism.
The ongoing ramifications of this
most insidious example of discrimina-
tion continue to be felt acutely by peo-
ple like many of my constituents. A re-
cent study by Duke University found
that the systemic denial of federally
guaranteed loans led to the widespread
use of predatory home sale contracts in
Chicago’s Black communities.
These contracts, Madam Speaker, led
to a situation where Black home buy-
ers paid, on average, over $71,000
more—I repeat, Madam Speaker, over
$71,000—for their homes than White
homeowners who had unfiltered access
to federally backed loans.
In total, Madam Speaker, redlining,
the practice of rating predominantly
Black neighborhoods as ‘‘high risk’’ for
traditional mortgage lenders, stole $3.2
million—this is by conservative esti-
mates, $3.2 million—stole up to $3.2
million from Chicago’s Black families.
This is just one example of how
homeownership, a pillar of the Amer-
ican Dream, has been placed out of
reach of far too many Americans due
solely to the color of their skin. It is
incumbent, Madam Speaker, upon all
of us to make this American Dream
equally available to all, regardless of
their skin color and regardless of their
ZIP Code.
Fortunately, Madam Speaker, there
are steps that this Congress can take
to support Black American homeown-
ership. For example, as the Urban In-
stitute notes, factoring rental payment
history into credit-scoring models
could increase financial opportunities
for Black home buyers.
Passing the Home Loan Quality
Transparency Act, a bill I am proud to
cosponsor, will restore a critical provi-
sion of Dodd-Frank, requiring mort-
gage lenders to report crucial details
about their borrowers, including credit
scores, racial and ethnic breakdowns,
and other data.

RESTORE TRUTH AND COMPAS-
SION TO IMMIGRATION DEBATE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
New York (Mr. SUOZZI) for 5 minutes.
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to speak about immigration in
America.
My father was born in Italy. He came
to the United States as a young boy. I
am a first-generation American, and I
don’t like the hateful and divisive rhet-
oric being used about immigrants
today. I am appalled at the way my
country is treating the children and
families of immigrants.
My dad came to America in the early
1920s. He was the first of his neighbor-
hood to graduate from college. During
World War II, he served as a navigator
on a B–24 and was awarded the Distin-
guished Flying Cross with three
oakleaf clusters. He returned home and

graduated from Harvard Law School on
the GI Bill.
As a young, Harvard-educated lawyer
and Italian immigrant, however, my
dad couldn’t find a job. Italians were
not respected, and after Hitler teamed
up with Mussolini during the war,
Italian Americans were not trusted, ei-
ther.
My dad decided to return to Glen
Cove, where he teamed up with another
Italian lawyer, ran for city court judge,
and became the youngest judge in the
history of New York State.
My father achieved many other great
successes, and he would always say,
‘‘What a country.’’ His life was the
very essence of the American Dream.
Our American Dream, however, is at
risk. It may soon be the American
nightmare.
Well, I still believe in my father’s
American Dream, and I am committed
to keeping it alive.
Immigration has been an issue for
decades, yet after all these years, Con-
gress has yet to pass immigration re-
form.
President Trump’s cruel, divisive,
and simply unworkable positions have
made things worse. His policies and
rhetoric have exacerbated the problem,
permeating a culture of fear that forces
many immigrants further into the
shadows.
I have been an advocate for fair and
reasonable immigration policies for
more than 25 years. As mayor of my
hometown of Glen Cove, New York, in
1994, I created the very first shape-up
center on the East Coast of the United
States of America. It gave newcomers
from Central and South America a safe
place to get hired and made sure they
got paid for the work they did. If they
didn’t get hired, they could stay and
learn English or new job skills.
As county executive, in 2007, I re-
fused to let ICE work with my Nassau
County Police Department because ICE
was acting like cowboys, drawing guns
and knocking down doors, intimidating
children and families who were not
even subject to their raids and all of
who together presented no risk of vio-
lence whatsoever.
Today, those same guys who gath-
ered on the street corners of Glen Cove
now own their own businesses and own
their own homes, and their kids at-
tended school with my kids.
But now, President Trump’s heart-
less immigration actions are sepa-
rating parents from their children, and
children are being housed in cages.
I have seen it with my own eyes. This
past July, I traveled to McAllen and
Brownsville, Texas, to personally in-
spect the detention and relief centers,
visit points of entry, speak with mi-
grant families, and meet with humani-
tarian aid organizations. My visit to
the detention centers along our south-
ern border was heartbreaking. I saw
men, women, and children being held in
awful conditions.
Our system is broken. These centers
are overcrowded, unsanitary, and clear-
ly ill-equipped to care for people in
great numbers.
Meanwhile, the administration con-
tinues to promulgate more callous and
mean-spirited decisions aimed at fur-
ther attacking immigrants. Deporting
children with cancer and diverting
funds from military programs to build
the wall, including money that was
meant to go toward building schools
for military families, and keeping im-
migrant children locked in indefinite
detention are unconscionable.
These decisions endorsed by this ad-
ministration are not consistent with
American values. America is founded
on the fundamental principle that ‘‘all
men and women are created equal.’’ It
is not that everyone with a green card
or U.S. citizenship is created equal; it
is that every man and woman is cre-
ated equal and should be treated with
human respect and dignity.
We must continue holding congres-
sional hearings on forced family sepa-
ration; the detention of children for
prolonged periods of time; the decision
to end TPS and DACA, the Dreamer
plan; and the overwhelming backlog in
U.S. immigration courts.
We must also defund hate, as my
friends at Bend the Arc are advocating,
and set a floor for refugee admissions
at 95,000, as my friends at the Hebrew
Immigrant Aid Society are advocating.
In addition to defunding the hateful
policies of this administration, we
must also strive for comprehensive im-
migration reform that treats people
like human beings, lives up to the
American Dream, gives a path of citi-
zenship for TPS recipients and Dream-
ers, gives protection to millions of oth-
ers, and secures our borders.
Robert F. Kennedy once said, ‘‘When
we tolerate what we know to be wrong,
when we close our eyes and ears to the
corrupt because we are too busy or too
frightened, when we fail to speak up
and speak out, we strike a blow against
freedom and decency and justice.’’
We need to restore truth and compas-
sion to the debate over immigration in
America, and we need to do it now, be-
cause the promise of the American
Dream demands it.

bers are reminded to refrain from en-

God of Heaven and Earth, we give
You thanks for giving us another day.
Today we remember a day 18 years
ago, begun in terror and violence, and
ended in heroic effort and courage. We
mourn those whose lives were snatched
from them, and wish to comfort those
left behind who still strive to cope with
their loss. May You, O God, give them
peace and healing.
We thank You again for the almost
universal, international response to a
great American tragedy, which all the
world recognized as theirs as well. All
Your children of good will could see the
horror of actions by men, who would
presume to act in Your name, causing
so much death and destruction. May
Your spirit of peace and justice con-
tinue to fill the hearts of people of all
faiths, races, and nations. Help us to
recognize Your creative love in the
lives of all who share this beautiful
planet.
Bless the men and women who serve
this great Nation in the Senate and
House of Representatives. May they be
reminded of the importance of standing
together to face the dangers presented
by America’s historical enemies.
May they be confident in the knowl-
edge that all Americans stand behind
them in their common effort to forge
legislation that will reflect the resil-
ient greatness of our Nation, protect
our democratic process, and build a vi-
brant economy into a safe and secure
future.
May all that is done this day be for
Your greater honor and glory.
Amen.

COMMEMORATING THE 18TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE SEPTEMBER 11
ATTACKS
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker,
how familiar this day is.
As a Member of the United States
Congress who was in this building on 9/
11, it was a bright and shiny day in
New York and Washington, D.C. as we
fled this building, saw the billowing
smoke in the Pentagon, and knew that
the other towers had already fallen by
someone telling us something had hap-
pened. Hearing rumors that planes
were flying into the White House and
the State Department, we wondered
about the resilience and the freedom of
this Nation.
How grateful I am to stand here, 18
years later, to remind Americans and
those who were not yet born that that
was a day that should be reminding us
every day of the greatness of our free-
dom, the value of our democracy, and
the power of our people.
We honor those who fell, those fami-
lies who still do not know of their
missing loved ones, those who went to
war, those who have come back.
But most of all, this day is to remind
us of the wonderment of the represen-
tation of this Nation, the diverse Na-
tion that it is, people from all walks of
life, that whatever we have to over-
come, whatever divisiveness we may
see yesterday, today, or tomorrow, it
will never—it will never—undermine
the greatness of this country.
I will always, as one who was here, I
will always remember and I will never
forget. And I honor those whose lives
were lost, pray for their families, but
celebrate this country as we sang on
the east steps, ‘‘God Bless America.’’
f
REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER THE
11TH IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON
TERRORISM
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, on the 18th anniversary of the
September 11th attacks, Patriot Day,
we remember Islamic extremist terror-
ists hijacked passenger jets to murder
nearly 3,000 innocent Americans in New
York, Washington, and Pennsylvania.
It is sickening to think of the men and
women and children who were slaugh-
tered. Our remembrance promotes the
legacy of the people who were merci-
lessly murdered.
I am humbled and inspired by the
strength and resilience, just as my col-
league, SHEILA JACKSON LEE, of our
country when we stand together to re-
member this mutual tragedy. Today, I
remain inspired by Todd Beamer’s he-
roic immediate response, ‘‘Let’s roll.’’
This summer, I visited the sites of Is-
lamic extremist attacks in Buenos
Aires, Argentina, of 1994 and in
Mumbai, India, of 2008. The brave peo-
ple of America, Argentina, and India
are prepared to stand together to resist
further mass murder.
On this day, we honor the lives of
those affected by the attack. It is also
a day to salute our military who served
to protect our freedom and to deny Is-
lamic extremists a safe haven in Af-
ghanistan.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.
f
REMEMBERING THE VICTIMS OF
THE GRANDVIEW BEACH BLUFF
COLLAPSE
(Mr. LEVIN of California asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Speak-
er, it is with great sadness that I rise
today to recognize an unimaginable
tragedy that occurred in my district
last month.
On August 2, three women from the
same family died when a coastal bluff
at Grandview Beach in Encinitas col-
lapsed on top of them: Julie Davis,
Annie Clave, and Elizabeth Charles.
They were enjoying a day at the beach
with family and friends celebrating
Elizabeth’s triumph over breast cancer.
Suddenly, all three were lost.
There is a lot that I would like to say
about the government’s responsibility
to help prevent similar tragedies in the
future, but, instead, I want to use this
moment to recognize the extraordinary
life that all three of these women
brought into this world.
I had the opportunity to sit down
with Dr. Pat Davis, who lost his wife,
one of his daughters, and his sister-in-
law on that day. Today, Dr. Davis is
committed to ensuring that no one else
experiences the same kind of loss that
he has. He has called for action from
local, State, and Federal officials to
prevent future bluff collapses, and we
stand together in these efforts. He is
truly an inspiration.
Please take a moment to think of
Julie, Annie, and Elizabeth. May they
rest in peace.
f
COMMEMORATING THE 18TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE SEPTEMBER 11
ATTACKS
(Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in remembrance of those who
lost their lives on 9/11/2001.
Eighteen years ago, the lives of inno-
cent men, women, and children were
senselessly taken at the hands of Is-
lamic terrorists under the command of
Osama bin Laden. Before day’s end,
nearly 3,000 civilians, firefighters, law
enforcement officers, and servicemem-
bers would perish in the World Trade
Center, on United Flight 93 in Pennsyl-
vania, and in the Pentagon.
Though another year has passed, the
pain remains for the families who lost
a loved one that fateful day. I pray for
all of those people who have lost some-
one today and pray for them tomorrow,
and I pray for those in harm’s way who
continue to serve across the globe to
ensure that we can live safely in the
greatest country in the world: the
United States of America.
Never forget, and may God bless
America.
In God we trust.
f
GUN VIOLENCE
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
Texas is home to many gun owners.
Growing up, my family owned guns
for hunting. It was part of how we fed
our family. Thus, I don’t want to in-
fringe on Second Amendment rights of
Americans.
I do, however, want to stop the kill-
ing of innocent lives because someone
was at risk to themselves or others
who bought or accessed a firearm. Too
many loopholes allow people to pur-
chase, procure, or access a firearm.
Too many Texans have already died
in mass shootings—so this is very per-
sonal to me—most recently, of course,
in west Texas.
The House has already passed two
bills that would prevent mass shoot-
ings. Last night, three more bills were
marked up and will be ready for a floor
vote.
Senate Republicans must allow a
vote on gun control legislation. I am
tired of people being killed because
they won’t act. I end by asking them,
Mr. Speaker: What will you do to save
lives? What are you afraid of?

COMMEMORATING THE 18TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE SEPTEMBER 11
ATTACKS
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1

Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, we all re-
member where we were on September
11, 2001. I, myself, drove my daughter,
Caroline, to school on my way to work.
She was in the third grade. Driving
over the Susquehanna River in Penn-
sylvania on my way to work, I recall
thinking what a beautiful day it was.
I watched with coworkers soon after
that the horror of the planes hitting
the World Trade Center and the Pen-
tagon. A few days later, I was asked to
come to Ground Zero to help.
I will never forget the hospitals were
all prepared for injured in Manhattan,
but there were no injured, or very few.
I will never forget the families and the
communities that showed resilience
and hope. I will never forget the crowds
of people cheering the first responders
as they traveled toward Ground Zero.

RECOGNIZING ARTS IN EDUCATION
WEEK
(Ms. PINGREE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
recognize Arts in Education Week.
As children return to school from
their summer vacations, I am reminded
that true education must go beyond
language arts and math. It must in-
clude daily access to creative subjects
like dance, poetry, visual arts, and the-
ater.
Ninety-three percent of Americans
agree: The arts are a vital part of a
well-rounded education, and when
schools make the investment, we see
ripple effects across students’ lives. A
student involved in the arts is four
times more likely to be recognized for
academic achievement; they are three
times more likely to win an award for
school attendance and are elected to
class office more than three times as
often as their peers.
We must do more to ensure every
child can regularly access arts edu-
cation. In the most recent appropria-
tions bill passed by this Chamber, we
included a $6 million increase to sup-
port Arts in Education at the Depart-
ment of Education.
I am proud to work with lawmakers
on both sides of the aisle to support
this program and will push to preserve
a strong increase in any final spending
bill.

LET’S PUT PARTISAN POLITICS
ASIDE
(Mr. BANKS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, it has been
almost 12 months since we reached a
new trade agreement with Mexico and
Canada. Both Mexico and Canada
promptly ratified the agreement, but
the House majority party refuses to let
us vote on it.
While it is a multinational agree-
ment, the benefits will be felt greatly
in my home State of Indiana. Forty-
seven percent of Indiana’s exports go to
Mexico and Canada, generating $18 bil-
lion in revenue for the Hoosier State.
American workers need this. Hoosier
workers need this.
Speaker PELOSI, please, let’s put par-
tisan politics aside and do what is best
for Indiana, for our country, and for all
of North America. It is time to find the
courage to bring this trade deal to the
floor for a vote.

REMEMBERING 9/11
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr.
Speaker, the events of September 11,
2001, and the courage of the first re-
sponders who ran into danger are for-
ever etched in our minds and our
hearts. Nearly 3,000 people were killed,
thousands more were injured, and for
many who were at Ground Zero, their
pain and suffering endure.
This year we finally made the 9/11
Victim’s Compensation Fund perma-
nent so that we can always take care of
our first responders, volunteers, and
their families. We learned many les-
sons on that day. Lessons in sacrifice,
sorrow, and bravery, as well as lessons
in national security preparedness and
foreign policy.
As we pause today to remember the
victims and all those who were im-
pacted by the attacks, let us also re-
member the lessons and maintain con-
stant vigilance in our shared national
commitment to never forget.
f
AMERICA WILL NEVER FORGET
9/11
(Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker,
never forget. In 2001 on 9/11, 2,977 peace-
ful people were murdered by 19 jihadi
terrorists who were recruited by, plot-
ted with, and were directed by al-Qaida
to commit evil acts of war against the
United States of America.
America is the greatest Nation to
ever exist. We must never waiver in our
resolve to defend our way of life. As the
world tragically learned on 9/11, terror-
ists should never be ignored or given
sanctuary to plan, prepare, or launch
their evil acts. As Scripture says, there
is a time for war. Following 9/11 was
such a time.
Sadly, America’s focus has long since
expanded from finding and eliminating
terrorists and those who give them
sanctuary. Great nations don’t fight
endless wars. If we are truly to make
America great again, we must be laser
focused. America does not negotiate
with terrorists or those who give them
sanctuary. There is no substitute for
victory.
f
WHEN WILL AMERICANS LEARN
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 1941, H.R. 1146, and H.R.
205, three bills which will prevent oil
and gas leasing on our Outer Conti-
nental Shelf, in Alaska’s Arctic Na-
tional Wildlife Refuge and near Flor-
ida’s Gulf Coast.
In 1969, America suffered a disastrous
oil spill off Santa Barbara. Two dec-
ades later, Exxon Valdez devastated
Prince William Sound. In 2010, Deep-
water Horizon ravaged the Gulf of Mex-
ico.
When will we learn? How much more
of our coastline will have to be ruined?
How many more local economies will
be shattered? How many more lives
will be lost?
Republican and Democratic officials
oppose the administration’s expanded
drilling plans. They know the health,
environmental, and economic costs of
oil spills and that those accidents
occur thousands of times each year.
There is no reason to take such risks,
especially when we have cleaner, safer
ways of producing the energy we need.
I applaud Representatives
CUNNINGHAM, HUFFMAN, and ROONEY for
offering this legislation to protect our
planet and in the spirit of Pennsylva-
nia’s Constitution, which guarantees
the people the right to clean air, clean
water, and the preservation of our nat-
ural aesthetic.
I urge Members to support these
bills. And I, too, say God bless America
this day and all days.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL OPIOID
AWARENESS WEEK
(Mr. GUTHRIE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize National Opioid
Awareness Week. My home State of
Kentucky has been one of the hardest
hit by our Nation’s ongoing opioid cri-
sis. Sadly, over 1,300 Kentuckians died
of a drug overdose in 2018.
I have been proud to work with my
colleagues on the House Energy and
Commerce Committee to combat the
ongoing nationwide opioid epidemic.
Next month we will honor the 1-year
anniversary of the SUPPORT Act being
signed into law. This landmark legisla-
tion is already helping communities
prevent the rampant spread of opioid
abuse, but more work needs to be done.
Last month I visited the Customs
and Border Patrol international mail
facility located at JFK Airport in New
York. There I saw firsthand the dan-
gers of illicit fentanyl coming through
our borders. Fentanyl is a synthetic
opioid that can be so potent it can kill
anyone that comes in contact with it,
including our law enforcement officers.
I will continue to work with President
Trump and my colleagues to stop
fentanyl from coming to our country
and help stop this epidemic from harm-
ing our communities.

minute and to revise and extend his re-

Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I am a New
York Representative whose district is
about 10 miles from the World Trade
Center, and I lost many friends and
constituents in that horrendous at-
tack.
Many years ago, President Roosevelt
stood right here in this Chamber and
talked about a day of infamy regarding
the attack on Pearl Harbor. Certainly,
also the day of these attacks was a day
of infamy, September 11, 2001.
I remember days and weeks after the
attacks you would just walk in my dis-
trict and see burned papers sort of
dropping from the clouds. It is really
something that we will remember for-
ever. We remember the brave respond-
ers. We remember the people that gave
their lives so that others can live. It
also told us that we in the United
States have to continue to fight tyr-
anny, have to continue to remember
those poor 3,000 souls whose lives
ended. It could have been any one of us.
They lost their lives.
So I think that this is a time for all
Americans to pause and say we cherish
our values. We remember the people
who lost their lives, and we will always
fight against oppression wherever it
rears its ugly head. God bless America.

RECOGNIZING OFFICER KAREN
BROWN
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-

tional Security Agency police officer
Ms. Karen Brown for being named the
2019 Federal Law Enforcement Train-
ing Center Honor Graduate of the Year.
The most prestigious award for FLETC
students, Ms. Brown excelled with high
marks in academics, physical fitness,
and firearms training.
Originally from Ohio, Ms. Brown has
worked at the NSA for the last 15 years
serving in a number of roles at the
agency; personal security, polygraph
examination, counterintelligence
threat examination, and more.
We thank Ms. Brown for her service
to our Nation. A ceremony was held at
FLETC to reward her accomplishments
on Tuesday, August 27.
In addition to Ms. Brown’s great
work, I want to thank all of the stu-
dents, recent graduates, and instruc-
tors at FLETC for their commitment
to our Nation in bettering their work-
force training. The Federal Law En-
forcement Training Camp in Glynn

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and to insert extraneous mate-
rials on H.R. 1941.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 548 and rule
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in
the Committee of the Whole House on
the state of the Union for the consider-
ation of the bill, H.R. 1941.
The Chair appoints the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR) to preside
over the Committee of the Whole.

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
consideration of the bill (H.R. 1941) to
amend the Outer Continental Shelf
Lands Act to prohibit the Secretary of
the Interior including in any leasing
program certain planning areas, and
for other purposes, with Mr. CUELLAR
in the chair.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the
bill is considered read the first time.
General debate shall be confined to
the bill and shall not exceed 1 hour
equally divided and controlled by the
chair and the ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Natural Re-
sources.
The gentleman from California (Mr.
LOWENTHAL) and the gentleman from
Utah (Mr. BISHOP) each will control 30
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
The first question is, what do all gov-
ernors, Republican and Democratic,
along the entire East Coast and along
the entire West Coast of the United
States and over 330 municipalities and
counties from these States all have in
common? You know what they have in
common? They are all opposed to ex-
panding offshore oil and gas develop-
ment off their shores.
Today we are here to ensure that
these coasts, the Atlantic and the Pa-
cific, receive the assurance and the
protection that they deserve. H.R. 1941,
the Coastal and Marine Economies Pro-
tection Act would permanently protect
the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts from
offshore oil and gas drilling. From
Maine down to Florida, from Wash-
ington to California, over 3,000 miles of
the United States’ coasts are threat-
ened by the fossil fuel industry-driven
agenda, which is driven by the Trump
administration.
One of President Trump’s first ac-
tions upon taking office was mandating
the development of a new and totally
unnecessary 5-year plan for offshore oil
and gas lease sales. In January 2018,
former Interior Secretary Zinke re-
leased a draft of that plan, which pro-
posed opening more than 90 percent of
the Outer Continental Shelf to oil and
gas development. This proposal in-
cluded the entirety of America’s Atlan-
tic and Pacific Coasts, and if enacted,
drilling could endanger more than
72,000 miles of U.S. shorelines.
Expectedly, there was immediate
pushback from citizens, elected offi-
cials, governors, business leaders, all
who understood that their coastal com-
munities are incompatible with off-
shore oil and gas.
The public knows that bringing in in-
dustry as risky and as dirty as oil and
gas to the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts
is dangerous on many levels. Our
oceans sustain a rich diversity of ma-
rine life, and they provide immense
value to America’s coastal commu-
nities by helping to generate billions of
dollars in economic output and by sup-
porting millions of jobs.
For example, thriving fish stocks and
healthy marine mammals off the coast
of New Jersey, Maryland, and Florida
support tackle shops, whale watching
tours, and a massive seafood industry.
And oil-free beaches and bays in Vir-
ginia and the Carolinas drive business
for local restaurants, for vacation rent-
als, and for outfitters.
But coastal residents are not the
only ones who will benefit from pro-
tecting these areas. Some of our Na-
tion’s most majestic national park
units belonging to all Americans are
along our coast, including Acadia, Bis-
cayne, Cape Hatteras, and Point Reyes.
People from all walks of life and di-
verse backgrounds and from both polit-
ical parties cherish these special
places, and they rely on healthy
oceans, clean beaches, and the abun-
dant fish and wildlife that come with
them.
The inevitable spills and the variety
of other onshore and offshore impacts
from oil and gas drilling have no place
along our East and West Coasts. Over
one million people are employed by the
tourism and recreation industries
along the East Coast. These are real

jobs that exist now and will only grow
if we continue to treat our oceans and
coasts with care. That is over four
times as many jobs as the industry-
generated fantasies that come with
opening the entire Atlantic seaboard to
drilling rigs.
Four times as many jobs would be at
risk from the industrial facilities that
would be built along the coast. Four
times as many jobs would be at risk
from the chronic pollution and pipeline
spills that are widespread with offshore
oil and gas. And four times as many
jobs would be at risk from a cata-
strophic blowout, like the one we saw
in the Gulf of Mexico only 9 years ago.
b 1230
None of these facts or the outcry
from concerned citizens have influ-
enced a Trump administration that is
laser-focused on doing the bidding of
the oil and gas industry. Instead of pro-
tecting our coasts, President Trump
and Secretary Bernhardt have played
politics and now are hiding their plan
to drill near our communities.
In January 2018, immediately after
the release of the draft leasing pro-
gram, then-Secretary Zinke met with
then-Governor of Florida RICK SCOTT
at the Tallahassee airport and tweeted
that he was removing Florida from the
leasing program. However, it turned
out that this was nothing more than a
ploy meant to boost the political pros-
pects of a Republican Senate can-
didate.
First Florida was in, then it was out,
then it was in again, and now nobody
except Secretary Bernhardt and Presi-
dent Trump knows for sure.
For 21⁄2 years, this administration has
based its offshore drilling decisions on
politics, not on the needs or the con-
cerns of coastal communities.
In April, the administration an-
nounced that its offshore leasing plans
are now on hold due to a recent court
decision that is related to Alaska. But
that is only a short-term reprieve. At
any moment, the administration can
restart its efforts to auction off our
Nation’s marine resources, which will
undoubtedly happen if the President
were to get a second term.
Coastal communities need assurance
that their businesses, beaches, and way
of life will not be sacrificed to the fos-
sil fuel industry by the Trump adminis-
tration.
H.R. 1941 provides our Atlantic and
Pacific constituents, including those
along Florida’s Atlantic Coast, the nec-
essary protections from the dangers of
offshore oil and gas, and it deserves
this body’s full support.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chair, we are here on September
11. It is an anniversary of an event that
has been impactful for all of us and has
definitely changed our country. We
cannot forget that. Hopefully, as a Na-
tion, we can learn from that experience
and from the dedication that people
gave during and after that particular
experience.
Mr. Chair, we are here in what the
Democrats have called their energy
week with their energy week proposals.
Their proposals are three very dis-
jointed bills not based on science but
based on the idea of paying off specific
political interest groups for political
purposes.
Earl Weaver, when he used to coach
the Baltimore Orioles, loved to bait the
umpires. One time, he went out to the
umpire and said: Is this as good as it
gets, or are you going to get better?
Of course, they threw him out of the
game for saying that.
However, today, I want to turn to the
Democrats and say: Guys, is this as
good as it gets, or are you going to get
better? Because what we have before us
is not an energy policy, it is an energy
nonpolicy.
When I was in college, gas was $0.25 a
gallon. I remember driving my car into
those gas stations, and there would be
a kid who would be my age or younger
coming out and filling up my tank,
cleaning the windshields, and checking
the oil and the tires. Then, they gave
me either a plate or a towel for show-
ing up.
I then went to Europe for 2 years, and
when I came back, the oil embargo had
hit. No one came out to help me. Ev-
erything was self-service. No one gave
me any more towels or dishes. Gas
prices in the embargo era were going
up to the astounding almost $1.40 a gal-
lon, which we could not believe.
Our new President at the time put on
a sweater, started a fire in the fire-
place, and came before the American
people and told us, basically: Get used
to it. Live with less. Take it as an
honor to be cold in the dark. That is
the process.
Fortunately, this country didn’t go
along with that, nor did the industry
go along with that. Instead of being a
country in which we were dependent
upon OPEC countries, 60 to 70 percent
of our energy coming from OPEC—and
I am sorry, that is not what an Irish
chicken does; that is a cartel. That is a
cartel that was very against the inter-
ests of the United States. Instead of
being that which was in the position to
be bullied not by a major power but a
secondary power into thinking they
could extort this country into chang-
ing our foreign policy simply by ex-
ploiting our energy vulnerabilities,
America changed, and instead, we de-
cided that would not be our policy.
We came up with a process of not
only expanding our energy production
in the United States, but we expanded
it in a way that produced energy more
efficiently; that used it in a cleaner
fashion; that used a smaller footprint
to do it; that made us energy inde-
pendent to the point where we could
be, instead of an importing country, an
exporting country in the concept of en-
ergy; and that energy was used not
only to support the United States’
independence but also to support our
allies and be able to confront negative
forces like Russia, which was using en-
ergy as a political weapon and still
would like to use energy as a political
weapon.
Now, we are faced with three bills
here today, one much different than
the other two. But the end result of the
Democratic vision of energy presented
to us in this energy week is basically
to use the rearview mirror and take us
backward 50 years into the past, where
we go back to the time when our econ-
omy was fragile, and our enemies
thought they could take advantage of
our energy dependency, and they could
do that to bully the United States.
That is not what the process should
be in creating an energy future for this
particular country.
Mr. Chair, we have three bills that
will be before us today. None of them
are scientifically grounded. All of them
are actually political, paying off polit-
ical experts, taking science and basi-
cally throwing it in the trash and say-
ing okay—which the majority can do.
They have the votes to do it but don’t
have the audacity to stand up and say
this administration or this side of the
aisle doesn’t believe in science because
these particular issues are politically
motivated.
There is no logic to what we are
doing. In our committee, it was won-
derful. We had the entire committee on
the same day that the first bill was
voted out also voting for LWCF. Every-
one loved the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund, so we wanted to make
this permanent. We wanted to triple
the amount of money that we were put-
ting into that fund. At the same time
that we voted to triple the amount of
money in that fund, we also voted for
bills that would basically cut the reve-
nues from those areas that produce the
money to go into the fund in the first
place, and we call that logical.
I call this hypocrisy as well because
there is the vested interest, as the ma-
jority here was saying, that Governors
in their States should have the ability
to make decisions on Federal waters
that are not within the boundaries of
their States but in the same breath
saying that Governors in the interior
States should not have the ability to
have decisions made on Federal lands
within our States.
I am sorry. That is pure hypocrisy.
This is a lack of focus. It is a lack of
focus when, a year ago, the Democratic
leadership asked the President to find
a way to cut down the cost of energy,
oil and gas, to use his personal con-
tacts to cut down the cost of that, and
then we are bringing bills in here today
that will drive up the costs, which will
cut down our possibility of doing that
in the future.
You can do it, but there is a hypoc-
risy to the very essence of what is
going on.
Unfortunately, the three bills that
will be thrown out here today by the

Democrats as their policy will have the
net effect of destroying jobs and harm-
ing our economy, potentially turning
us to an economic tailspin. That can
happen.
More importantly, it is nice to have
a visual contrast, because this morn-
ing, Republican leaders, led by Mr.
SCALISE and Ms. CHENEY and several
others, introduced a comprehensive en-
ergy package, an energy package that
is for all energy, all of the above, both
fossil fuel and alternative, one that
will grow our economy, which will cre-
ate more jobs, which will give a logical
standard of what we should do going
forward with a clear view.
The clear view of what Republicans
would like to do with having a logical,
comprehensive approach is in vast con-
trast to three disjointed, dispirited,
nonscientific bills that simply want to
pay off political communities.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I yield
5 minutes to the gentleman from South
Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM).
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Chair, I rise
in support of my bill, H.R. 1941, the
Coastal and Marine Economies Protec-
tion Act.
My bipartisan bill permanently pro-
tects the Atlantic and the Pacific
Coasts from the threats of offshore oil
and gas drilling. It reflects the tremen-
dous importance that Members of both
parties place on healthy shorelines and
the State and local economies that de-
pend on them. This bill acknowledges
that if we don’t act, drilling rigs could
soon appear off of our beaches.
Folks from up and down the coast of
my district understand that opposition
to offshore drilling is not a partisan
issue. Whether it be a first grader like
Anna Caroline of upstate South Caro-
lina who rallied 70 signatures to stop
offshore drilling or a group of mayors
like Billy Keyserling, Pat O’Neil, Tim
Goodwin, Jimmy Carroll, or John
Tecklenburg who worked tirelessly to
defend our coastline, South Carolinians
want to protect our community from
the disastrous consequences that result
from offshore drilling. The Lowcountry
is a force to be reckoned with, and we
stand firm in our opposition to drilling
off of our shoreline.
Down in the Lowcountry, we know
that offshore drilling would ruin our
economy, our vibrant natural re-
sources, and our unique way of life.
That is why opposition to offshore
drilling is not a partisan issue, and I
am proud to work with both Democrats
and Republicans to get this done.
Offshore drilling and the booming
tourism industry that we have in the
Lowcountry are mutually exclusive
pursuits. Tourism in the Palmetto
State is a $22.6 billion-a-year industry
and supports 1 in every 10 jobs in our
State. South Carolina’s tourism indus-
try holds a great deal more promise for
statewide economic prosperity.
I want to take a moment to also con-
sider how natural disasters would im-
pact our State if we were to drill off-
shore. We have seen spills from onshore
infrastructure in the path of a hurri-
cane. Hurricane Katrina is the best-
known example, with roughly 8 million
gallons of oil spilled.
Last week, Hurricane Dorian was a
sobering reminder that hurricanes and
natural disasters can change course in
a moment’s notice and inflict tremen-
dous damage on communities in the
path of a storm.
If Charleston, Hilton Head, or Beau-
fort had onshore energy infrastructure
similar to Port Fourchon or Galveston,
the potential for a major spill or envi-
ronmental calamity from Dorian’s de-
struction would have skyrocketed.
Opposition to offshore drilling is an
economic one, but it is also a moral
one. The book of Genesis teaches us to
be stewards and caretakers of all cre-
ation. I find it unconscionable that we
can knowingly damage our waters and,
consequentially, our marine life for
such a pursuit.
Offshore drilling is reckless; it is
harmful; and it is absolutely disruptive
to the communities that we call home.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support my bill that will permanently
safeguard the First District of South
Carolina and coastal communities
across this Nation.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN), who has
unusual socks on today and who has
been through these wars before.
b 1245
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Chairman, I stand
in opposition to this legislation which
undermines the United States’ energy
dominance and makes us strategically
weaker as a nation.
I remember Admiral Mike Mullen
saying there is no national security
without energy security. We get that
by exploring and developing the nat-
ural resources we are blessed with in
this Nation.
Currently, 67 percent of the energy
used in our Nation is generated from
oil and gas; 94 percent of the Outer
Continental Shelf is off limits to explo-
ration. The Department of the Interior
projects that an estimated 89.9 billion
barrels and 327 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas has yet to be discovered on
the Outer Continental Shelf.
Opening up the entire Atlantic Outer
Continental Shelf could support nearly
265,000 new, higher paying jobs, $22 bil-
lion a year in private investment, and
generate almost $6 billion in new rev-
enue for the government within 20
years of the initial lease. Mr.
CUNNINGHAM’s bill blocks $2.2 billion
from going to schools, roads, and con-
servation efforts in South Carolina.
Through revenue sharing, oil and
natural gas development are a critical
source of funding for many valuable
programs. Over the past 10 years, roy-
alty payments from lease sales have
generated $73 billion for the Federal
Government. Much of this money goes
into conservation programs, such as
the Land and Water Conservation
Fund. Many people on the other side of
the aisle that will support this bill also
supported the reauthorization of the
Land and Water Conservation Fund.
In 2018, the LWCF received $893 mil-
lion in offshore revenues. South Caro-
lina received $1.5 million in 2018 from
the Land and Water Conservation
Fund. Oil and gas royalties totaled
about 90 percent of the LWCF’s fund-
ing. Congress has already voted to per-
manently reauthorize in this Congress.
How do the supporters of this bill in-
tend to make up nearly all of the fund-
ing for a program that they supported
that they would be cutting with this
bill? They would do it by taxing the
hardworking American citizens, I
guess.
Blocking offshore development would
not only significantly harm our econ-
omy, but it would increase dependence
on our adversaries for energy.
Just in 2018, there was a Russian
LNG tanker that arrived in the Boston
harbor. It traveled 4,500 miles from
Russia to the U.S. when the United
States has been the number one pro-
ducer of natural gas since 2009.
New England relies on foreign coun-
tries for about 20 percent of its natural
gas. Why? Because we don’t have the
pipeline capacity running from the
Marcellus shale up to New England to
provide American natural gas, so they
are having to buy from Russia.
Development of our resources on the
Outer Continental Shelf, opening up
areas that were blocked by past admin-
istrations to energy development, ex-
ploration, and, ultimately, production,
provides money for the Land and Water
Conservation Fund, and it provides na-
tional security for places like New
England and lessens their dependence
on a foreign source of natural gas. And
that foreign source, ladies and gentle-
men, is Russia.
Let this be a lesson in what is in
store for this country if this bill is
adopted. This bill leverages our adver-
sary, Russia, while undermining our se-
curity.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE).
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, let me
first thank the sponsor of this legisla-
tion, Mr. CUNNINGHAM, the gentleman
from California (Mr. LOWENTHAL), and
Mr. GRIJALVA for all of their work on
this legislation.
I want to say that I do think a per-
manent moratorium on oil and gas
drilling in the Pacific and Atlantic
Oceans’ Outer Continental Shelf plan-
ning areas is something that we must
do. It doesn’t matter whether you rep-
resent the Atlantic or the Pacific Coast
communities. A vote for a permanent
moratorium on oil and gas develop-
ment along these shores is a vote for
our country’s economic vitality.
I heard my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle and the last two speak-
ers talk about national security and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7609

how we don’t have an energy plan. The
bottom line is that, if you look at the
consequences to the economy of the
country in these coastal communities
from something like the BP Deepwater
Horizon disaster, it was a 10-year pro-
jected economic loss of $8.7 billion in
fisheries from Texas to Florida, includ-
ing 22,000 lost jobs just for fisheries.
Think of the impact on the tourism
industry with the impact on local busi-
nesses if we have a spill of this mag-
nitude. Tourism is now the number one
industry in my State of New Jersey.
And don’t tell me that we don’t have
an energy plan. In the Energy and
Commerce Committee, we are very
much in favor of all kinds of energy op-
tions—natural gas, nuclear power,
whatever it happens to be—and we cer-
tainly have moved towards energy
independence by having more natural
gas and more production of oil.
All we are saying here today is that,
when you talk about offshore drilling
in the Atlantic and the Pacific, if you
weigh any benefits that might come ei-
ther in jobs or in money that comes
back to the Land and Conservation,
whatever, you cannot possibly compare
the economic loss that we would have
from a major oil spill to whatever gain
you have from this relatively small
amount of oil that is going to be cap-
tured by these oil companies in off-
shore drilling on the Atlantic and the
Pacific Coasts.
After the BP oil spill—I was on the
Natural Resources Committee at the
time—there were recommendations
that were put together by a bipartisan
commission. Not all of those were
adopted. But even with those rec-
ommendations, in the 7 years following
the Deepwater Horizon tragedy, there
were 34 additional oil spills of more
than 2,000 gallons each.
There is no way to stop these oil
spills from happening. They happen on
a regular basis. The further out you go,
the more chance there is that you are
going to have a spill, and we cannot
risk that.
The Jersey shore has already experi-
enced a historic disaster in the past
few years. It was called Hurricane
Sandy. We don’t need a man-made dis-
aster that is going to shut down our
businesses, cripple our housing market,
harm our health, or hurt our environ-
ment. The ocean is strained too much
by too much trash and disposal of plas-
tics and the climate crisis that trig-
gered an increase in sea temperatures
and acidification.
In fact, we don’t have to choose be-
tween a clean ocean and energy produc-
tion. Any energy we harness off the
coast could come increasingly from
clean, renewable sources like offshore
wind.
I am not saying that renewables are
the only alternative. We still have to
have fossil fuels, there is no question.
But the damage that comes to our
local economies cannot possibly com-
pare to whatever jobs you think are
going to be created or whatever money
you think is going to come from this
offshore drilling. It is miniscule in
comparison to the economic impact to
our area.
So don’t talk to me about jobs and
loss of jobs when you see the loss of
jobs that occurred after BP and could
occur to our shores. There is absolutely
no comparison, gentlemen. I have to
say that over and over again.
Now, we have put 1-year annual
moratoriums. We passed an amend-
ment that I had in the appropriations
bill, Interior appropriations, to have a
moratorium on an annual basis in the
appropriations bill, but it is high time
that we have a permanent moratorium.
It is not enough to just address this an-
nually through the appropriations
process.
Mr. Chairman, I want to particularly
commend the gentleman from South
Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM). I was actu-
ally in his district, and I just heard
unanimous praise of his effort to stop
this drilling.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman,
once again, I appreciate the oppor-
tunity to yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON),
someone who realizes that not only
does the base bill stop drilling, but if
you add one of the amendments they
have, you are going to stop any kind of
seismic activity that would allow al-
ternative activity to be developed in
these sources, as well.
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today in opposition to H.R. 1941, a bill
that would permanently block respon-
sible oil and gas development in the
Atlantic and Pacific planning areas.
As a Representative from a district
that has overwhelming amounts of
Federal land, I often find myself en-
gaged with my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle about the importance
of allowing local leaders to be able to
manage the lands that are around
them, making decisions about what
happens on those public lands that sur-
round their communities.
The argument I am met with is that
public lands belong to all Americans,
to benefit all Americans.
And it is true, the responsible energy
development that happens on public
lands in my district benefits all Ameri-
cans in the form of reliable and low-
cost energy sources, but we are here
today debating a bill that would put
the wishes of some States to close off
submerged lands under Federal land ju-
risdictions ahead of the interests of all
Americans.
When it comes to local control, why
should local coastal States lead the
way while landlocked Western States
are told time and again that the Fed-
eral Government knows what is best?
I have been a longtime advocate for
an all-of-the-above energy plan in the
U.S. This means wind, solar, geo-
thermal, hydropower, natural gas, oil,
oil shale, and minerals.
An InsideClimate News article from
January of last year outlined the in-
vestments offshore oil and gas compa-
nies are making in wind energy due to
market demand and to the unique posi-
tion that they are in, having already
made significant onshore infrastruc-
ture investments.
According to a 2017 Wood Mackenzie
study, annual revenues from wind and
solar could represent one-twelfth of the
revenues in oil and gas by 2035 as some
major oil and gas companies seize op-
portunities in the wind power market.
If the goal of my friends on the other
side of the aisle is to reduce our coun-
try’s reliance on fossil fuels, why push
policies that cut off the source of the
investment of oil and gas companies
that are making renewable energy? We
should be supporting industry and mar-
ket-led shifts to renewable energy, not
imposing drastic policies like H.R. 1941
that hamstring these efforts.
Finally, earlier this year, the House
and Senate overwhelmingly passed a
public lands package that permanently
authorized the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund. All States benefit from
the Land and Water Conservation
Fund, so we can’t ignore the fact that
the bill we are debating today would
cut off the source of funding for the
program, which, as we all know, is off-
shore oil and gas revenues.
There have been many calls from my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle
to be able to pass a measure that will
provide for mandatory funding of the
Land and Water Conservation Fund.
How can we push for mandatory Land
and Water Conservation Fund funding
and, at the same time, advocate for a
bill that completely cuts off Land and
Water Conservation Fund sources?
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to vote ‘‘no’’ on the underlying bill.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
California (Mr. LEVIN).
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise today in support of H.R.
1941, the Coastal and Marine Econo-
mies Protection Act, to ban new off-
shore drilling along the Atlantic and
Pacific Coasts.
My district is home to over 50 miles
of beautiful California coastline. It is
home to some of the world’s premier
marine research institutions, not to
mention some of the best surfing in the
country.
In San Diego and Orange Counties,
the ocean economy accounts for $7.7
billion and sustains more than 140,000
jobs in coastal tourism and recreation.
All it will take to jeopardize those jobs
is a massive spill like the one we saw
off the coast of Santa Barbara in 2015,
which poured 142,000 gallons of crude
oil into the water and onto beaches
across southern California. That is why
the people I represent have made their
voices heard loud and clear: No more
drilling off our coast.
We can’t allow the fossil fuel indus-
try and their friends in the Trump ad-
ministration to exploit our oceans for
their own profit, roll back safety regu-
lations that help prevent spills, and
threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7610 September 11, 2019
I expect we will hear a lot more from
my friends across the aisle, many of
whom represent landlocked districts,
who claim there is nothing to worry
about. Well, they should know that the
folks who actually live in coastal com-
munities won’t stop fighting to protect
our oceans and our jobs.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman,
I am happy to yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CLINE),
our new Member in his first term here.
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the ranking member for yielding.
Mr. Chairman, I come from the Com-
monwealth of Virginia, a Common-
wealth which is rich in natural re-
sources. We have an abundant supply of
energy sources, but this legislation
would destroy the untapped potential
for research and investment in oil and
gas resources off our coast.
This bill would stifle innovation, pre-
vent job creation, and severely limit
the ability of our Nation to realize its
full potential of achieving long-term
energy independence.
Studies have shown that exploring
offshore oil and natural gas resources
would bring thousands of jobs to Vir-
ginia and significantly boost its econ-
omy.
b 1300
Earlier this spring I traveled with
Congressman SCALISE and a delegation
of Members to his district in Lou-
isiana, and helicoptered off into the
Gulf of Mexico where I was able to see
firsthand the great strides that have
been made in energy exploration, tech-
nology, and innovation, and the great
benefits that have accrued to Lou-
isiana: Louisiana schools, Louisiana
roads, and port projects as a result.
The amazing developments in ensur-
ing that energy resources can be ex-
plored and extracted safely and with
minimal impact to our environment,
demonstrated to me that similar ef-
forts can be achieved back home in the
waters off the coast of Virginia, and
that our environmentally sensitive
areas would be protected for future
generations to enjoy, while we can
lower energy costs for residents and
businesses across our great Common-
wealth.
H.R. 1941 would block millions of dol-
lars from going to Virginia and other
coastal States. If South Carolina
doesn’t want the money, fine, but the
Federal Government should not be in
the business of halting Virginia and, in
turn, America’s economic growth. Fail-
ing to give States like mine the ability
to explore the resources off our coast
would be a grave disservice to my con-
stituents, our Commonwealth, and our
Nation.
I urge my colleagues to oppose this
misguided legislation.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE).
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chair, I rise in
strong support of H.R. 1941, the Coastal
and Marine Economies Protection Act.
Mr. Chair, the administration’s pro-
posed 5-year plan for expanded oil and
gas leasing would pose significant dan-
ger to our Nation’s coastal waters
which are home to thousands of plant
and animal species that rely on a well-
balanced marine ecosystem.
According to Oceana, oil and gas ex-
ploration could have untold effects on
fish and marine wildlife, from decreas-
ing fish catches, to increase stranding
or beaching of marine mammals.
On top of this, our oceans are an
enormous driver of our States’ econo-
mies. In my home State of Rhode Is-
land, ocean industries such as fishing,
tourism, and recreation account for
nearly $2 billion in annual economic
activity and support more than 41,000
jobs.
Throughout New England, it ac-
counts for more than $17 billion annu-
ally. Our States cannot afford to risk
the dangers posed to our oceans and
coasts by the administration’s mis-
guided proposal to expand oil and gas
drilling in the Atlantic. We cannot af-
ford to sit by and watch the President
plunder our oceans for the benefit of
the big oil companies at the expense of
polluting our oceans, endangering fish-
ing and tourism industries, and harm-
ing coastal communities.
I was proud to introduce legislation
earlier this year, the New England
Coastal Protection Act, which would
prohibit drilling in the Outer Conti-
nental Shelf off of the coast of the New
England States, which I am proud to
say has the support of every Member of
Congress from New England, and which
is incorporated in this bill before the
House today.
It is imperative that this country
pursue a cleaner, more sustainable en-
ergy future which protects our oceans
and coastlines, stimulates innovation,
and spurs job growth.
I strongly urge passage of this legis-
lation.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. BOST), who happens to be
the Republican co-chair of the House
Congressional Steel Caucus.
Mr. BOST. Mr. Chair, I thank my col-
league for yielding.
Mr. Chairman, for years, we have
been told that we live in a resource-
poor Nation. We were also told that the
domestic oil and gas reserves were de-
pleted. But, today, we know how wrong
those predictions are.
America is now the world leader in
energy development. But don’t forget
about the jobs. Oil and gas production
is a jobs multiplier. According to re-
cent studies, more than 10 million
American jobs can be attributed to oil
and gas production. For each drilling
and oil job, many more are created in
manufacturing, transportation, and
service industries.
In my district, the U.S. Steel Granite
City Works facility produces the steel
for Oil Country Tubular Goods. These
products are used in oil and gas produc-
tion. These are good-paying jobs with
great benefits.
In addition to the steel jobs in Gran-
ite City, approximately 10,000 Illinois
manufacturers have jobs that have oil
and gas industry ties. According to
some estimates, an additional 1 million
manufacturing jobs could be created
through oil and gas development.
We need to think about this as the
political fringes try to shove the Green
New Deal down our throats.
I urge my colleagues to oppose this
legislation.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Maine (Ms. PINGREE).
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I thank the
chairman for his work on this and for
yielding me the time.
Today I rise in support of the Coastal
Marine Economies Protection Act and
to defend Maine’s coastline for future
generations.
This summer, I was blessed to, once
again, become a grandmother. With the
birth of my new grandson, I am now
lucky enough to be the grandmother of
four. All four of my grandchildren
played in and around the ocean this
summer, the Gulf of Maine, just as
their parents have done and so many
other Mainers do every summer.
The Gulf of Maine is an irreplaceable
natural resource that is a draw for mil-
lions of tourists each year, and it is
critical to the Maine economy. It
should not be exploited for oil and
drilling.
The climate crisis has already taken
a toll on our waters. It has caused
ocean acidification and rising sea lev-
els, and the warming of the ocean has
put Maine’s vibrant fishing industries
in peril.
Drilling for fossil fuels in the Gulf of
Maine when we should be investing in
renewable energy, is like trying to put
out a fire by dousing it with kerosene.
I believe it is our duty as elected
leaders to leave this Nation better than
we found it. That means ensuring we
preserve our oceans for our children
and our grandchildren, and we fight
this climate crisis with all we have got.
The CHAIR. The time of the gentle-
woman has expired.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I yield
an additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from Maine.
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I hope my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle
will join me in supporting H.R. 1941, be-
cause sacrificing our coastline to fur-
ther this Nation’s dependence on fossil
fuels is nothing short of irresponsible.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman,
I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman
from Georgia (Mr. CARTER).
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition
to this bill and the other two natural
resources bills that we will be consid-
ering this week.
Let me start by saying that it is un-
fortunate that we are in this position
today. One of the predominant reasons
for this disappointment is that I, like
many of my colleagues, both support

energy development, while looking
after our natural and ecological re-
sources.
I love my district dearly. I was born
and raised there. I have lived there all
of my life and will continue to live
there the rest of my life. I value the
beautiful coastline that we have in my
district.
But blanket bans instituted by these
bills across the Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf,
and Arctic are misguided and are, quite
plainly, the wrong approach.
In January of last year, I raised con-
cerns with the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management about how this plan
would affect Georgia and my constitu-
ents. In April of this year, after the
Georgia General Assembly passed a res-
olution opposing energy exploration in
Federal waters off of Georgia, I sent a
letter to Secretary Bernhardt request-
ing he exclude Georgia from consider-
ation under this plan.
Mr. Chair, I have taken public service
seriously for my entire life. When I was
elected to serve the people of the First
District of Georgia, I knew that I
would be representing the will of my
constituents up here. That is why I
have been firm in my stance that Geor-
gia be removed from consideration due
to concerns from the State legislature.
But while my request to remove
Georgia from consideration under this
plan stands, I firmly believe it would
be unwise and counterproductive to
move forward with this blanket ban on
U.S. Federal waters.
Knowing these bills would be coming
to the floor, I knew I needed to do
something to support the request I
heard in the district that waters off of
Georgia be removed. That is why I, in
order to abide by my commitment to
my constituents in our community,
submitted three amendments to the
Rules Committee.
Unfortunately, my amendments,
which would empower States to decide
what is best for them, remove Georgia
from consideration, and address under-
sea national security, were not accept-
ed by my colleagues across the aisle.
Let me be clear. This wasn’t a rejec-
tion of including the amendments in
the bill. This was a rejection of the
ability to even debate them.
My colleagues across the aisle who
had championed the will of the States
to decide what is best for them when it
comes to this topic, would not let my
amendments move forward. For those
who were so opposed to energy develop-
ment offshore, I didn’t even have the
opportunity to have an amendment re-
moving Georgia from consideration de-
bated on the floor of this House.
Mr. Chair, it is really unfortunate
that we are voting on these bills which
would sacrifice tens of thousands of
jobs and millions in economic benefits
for political grandstanding.
To step back on domestic energy de-
velopment is to promote foreign energy
consumption. I can still remember
when the United States was held hos-
tage to Middle Eastern resources, and
we can’t allow that to happen again.
While I believe Georgia should be re-
moved from consideration, these bills
are not the solution. I oppose these
three bills, and I hope my colleagues
will actually work with us on real solu-
tions rather than promoting messaging
bills.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from New
Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL).
Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chair, chair-
man, and ranking member, I rise today
on behalf of our oceans and the com-
munities, economies and ecosystems
they support.
My home State of New Jersey boasts
a multibillion dollar commercial and
fishing industry. That’s 50,000 jobs and
$7 billion every year. Potential spills
from oil and gas development imperil
every one of these jobs and every one of
those industries. That is 50,000 jobs and
$7 billion a year, not to mention the
threat to exacerbating climate change.
An oil spill could trigger even greater
devastation to the nearly 500,000 jobs
supported by our State’s tourism in-
dustry. Visits to the beautiful shore
generates $16.6 billion in wages and
adds $5.5 billion to the State’s tax cof-
fers. Too much is at stake.
We cannot auction off our environ-
ment. We can’t auction off our econ-
omy, and we sure as heck can’t auction
off our future to the highest bidder.
We need to move away from dirty
fossil fuels that would forever change
the character of our coasts for the
worse. We need to protect the Atlantic
Coast by permanently banning offshore
oil and gas drilling.
Mr. Chairman, we need a concrete
plan of action like this because the cli-
mate is changing in a way that threat-
ens our national security, or eco-
systems, and our economy.
Thanks to H.R. 1941—and I commend
the sponsors—the Coastal and Marine
Economies Protection Act, we are act-
ing to permanently protect the Atlan-
tic from offshore oil and gas drilling
right now. I thank the chairman, Mr.
Chair, and the ranking member for this
bill.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from New
Jersey (Mr. VAN DREW).
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Chair, I rise
today because I wholeheartedly sup-
port the Coastal and Marine Economy
Protection Act, authored by my good
friend, Congressman CUNNINGHAM.
This bill does what seems obvious to
almost everyone. It bans offshore drill-
ing in the Atlantic Ocean. It is an issue
that brings together business groups,
environmental groups, sportsmen
groups, and many, many others. It is
an issue that transcends party lines.
In my district, we had a press con-
ference in support of this legislation
and banning, and we had Republicans,
Democrats, Independents,
businesspeople, as well as environ-
mentalists all together.
In south Jersey, our coast is our life-
blood. It is everything. It is our econ-
omy, it is our culture, and it is our way
of life.
Our fisheries and tourism industry
are worth nearly $50 billion a year, sup-
porting well over half a million jobs
statewide. If an oil spill would occur on
our coastline, our beaches, natural re-
sources, and coastal properties would
be wiped out in a heartbeat.
Our fishermen, casino workers, hospi-
tality industry, restaurants, and small
businesses would all, each and every
one, suffer.
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’
on H.R. 1941.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TED LIEU).
b 1315
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr.
Chair, I thank Representative
LOWENTHAL for his leadership.
Today, I rise in support of this legis-
lation by Representative CUNNINGHAM
to ban offshore oil drilling in both the
Atlantic and Pacific. This would apply
to new offshore oil drilling. Such oil
drilling is both dangerous and harms
coastal economies.
My congressional district spans the
coast of Los Angeles from Palos Verdes
to Malibu. Its natural beauty is rivaled
by few, and the tourism, recreation,
and other ocean-related industries
flourish because of it.
Just a few years ago, in 2015, an oil
pipeline ruptured in Santa Barbara to
the north of my district, spilling 100,000
gallons of oil into the ocean, killing
wildlife, and forcing closure of beaches
in my district as their oil flowed down.
This oil spill can affect large pieces of
land and our environment, and our
economy suffered.
H.R. 1941 is a forward-thinking bill
that will protect California’s coast and
help turn us away from fossil fuels. At
a time when tackling the climate crisis
is absolutely critical, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I
continue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), who is the majority
leader.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentleman from California for yielding.
I thank Mr. BISHOP for his leadership
as well.
I rise in strong support of this bill in-
troduced by Mr. CUNNINGHAM from
South Carolina and two other bills on
the floor this week that will be consid-
ered. All three are bipartisan bills.
I thank Mr. CUNNINGHAM for his lead-
ership on this particular issue.
A permanent moratorium on offshore
oil and gas development in pristine, un-
touched areas will help protect eco-
systems and economies all along our
Nation’s Atlantic and Pacific Coasts.
The other bills we will be considering
this week will prevent oil and gas drill-
ing along the Gulf Coast of Florida and

protect the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge.
The Trump administration is forcing
a false choice between energy security
and the health and safety of our coast-
al and Arctic environments. If we fail
to protect vulnerable coastal and Arc-
tic ecosystems, then we put at risk the
livelihoods of millions of Americans in
those communities that depend on
their continued health and abundance.
In coastal communities on the Atlan-
tic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of
Mexico, tourism, outdoor recreation,
and fishing are crucial to their econo-
mies. In Alaska, the Gwich’in people
rely on the carefully balanced Arctic
ecosystem for hunting, fishing, and
their ancient way of life. Drilling in
these areas creates an unacceptable
risk both to our environment and to
the people who live in those commu-
nities.
Mr. Chair, the United States is now
the largest producer of oil and gas in
the world. No one would have thought
that possible even a decade ago, yet
here we are. Thank to advances in
technology, over the past 6 years, we
have doubled the amount of oil we ex-
port. All of that has been made possible
without touching vulnerable environ-
ments like the Arctic refuge or off the
coast of my home State of Maryland,
the Atlantic or the Pacific.
The Trump administration is pro-
posing to open the entire eastern sea-
board for oil and gas development,
from the Gulf of Maine to the Straits
of Florida. States up and down the At-
lantic, including my own State, oppose
this move. We have seen what happens
when something goes wrong, as was the
case with the Deepwater Horizon dis-
aster in 2010. An oil spill making its
way into the Chesapeake Bay and de-
stroying our world-class fisheries or
harming the beautiful beaches of Mary-
land’s Chesapeake and Atlantic shores
would, frankly, be devastating.
Instead of doubling down on fossil
fuels, we ought to be working to recon-
figure our economy to meet the chal-
lenges of climate change and seize op-
portunities from developing new clean
energy technologies and leading the
world in transitioning to a low- and
eventually zero-carbon economy.
The Democratic-led House already,
Mr. Chair, took action on climate
change earlier this year with the pas-
sage of H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now
Act, which would uphold our commit-
ment to the Paris climate agreement
that the President inadvisably with-
drew from.
We will also continue taking mean-
ingful action to stop the Trump admin-
istration’s rollback of rules meant to
protect clean air, clean water, and nat-
ural environments for generations to
come. Our children, Mr. Chair, and our
grandchildren—and, yes, our great-
grandchildren—deserve to inherit an
Earth and an America that is clean,
healthy, and sustainable. We ignore
this challenge, Mr. Chair, at our peril.
Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman
from California (Mr. LOWENTHAL) for
leading this effort; I thank Mr.
CUNNINGHAM; and I rise in strong sup-
port of the legislation we are going to
consider.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, how
much time is remaining?
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
California has 6 minutes remaining.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CARBAJAL), who is a highly
respected Representative.
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Chair, I rise in
support of H.R. 1941, the Coastal and
Marine Economies Protection Act, to
ensure we safeguard our environment
against the threats of offshore oil drill-
ing. I am proud to have worked with
Chairman GRIJALVA, Chairman
LOWENTHAL, and Representative
CUNNINGHAM to make sure that this
measure also includes my legislation,
H.R. 279, the California Clean Coast
Act. This would make certain that
there is no future offshore oil and gas
leasing off California’s coast and put
the interests of the American people
first.
We cannot put corporate profits of
Big Oil above protecting our environ-
ment. My constituents in the central
coast have seen firsthand the damage
oil spills inflicted on our communities
and our local economies. During the
1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, over
100,000 barrels of crude oil spilled into
the Santa Barbara Channel. This was
the largest oil spill in California’s his-
tory. It fundamentally harmed Santa
Barbara’s unique marine ecosystem
and wildlife, recreational interests, and
commercial fishing.
The CHAIR. The time of the gen-
tleman has expired.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I yield
the gentleman from California an addi-
tional 30 seconds.
Mr. CARBAJAL. Paired with the 2015
Plains Refugio oil spill, where cleanup
costs hit $92 million, these incidents
show us that we cannot afford another
disastrous oil spill.
In contrast, California’s coastal re-
gion tourism generates over $1.9 tril-
lion of GDP per year. It also supports
more than $731 billion in wages. Any
future oil drilling would pose a direct
threat to our local economies and the
success of local businesses that are tied
to clean oceans and healthy eco-
systems. We must safeguard our planet
and economy for future generations,
including my two grandchildren,
Roman and Gianna. This is why I urge
passage of H.R. 1941, the Coastal and
Marine Economies Protection Act.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD a
Statement of Administrative Policy,
which indicates the President’s advis-
ers would recommend a veto of this
particular bill in the unlikely event
that it will actually be considered by
the Senate, but, Mr. Chair, you can bet
your Social Security payments it won’t
be.
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
H.R. 205—PROTECTING AND SECURING FLORIDA’S
COASTLINE ACT OF 2019—(REP. ROONEY, R–FL,
AND 18 COSPONSORS)
H.R. 1146—ARCTIC CULTURAL AND COASTAL
PLAIN PROTECTION ACT—(REP. HUFFMAN, D–
CA, AND 182 COSPONSORS)
H.R. 1941—COASTAL AND MARINE ECONOMIES
PROTECTION ACT—(REP. CUNNINGHAM, D–SC,
AND 51 COSPONSORS)
The Administration opposes H.R. 205, the
Protecting and Securing Florida’s Coastline
Act of 2019, H.R. 1146, the Arctic Cultural and
Coastal Plain Protection Act, and H.R. 1941,
the Coastal and Marine Economies Protec-
tion Act. These bills would undermine the
Administration’s commitment to a pros-
perous American economy supported by the
responsible use of the Nation’s abundant nat-
ural resources. Development of our resources
enhances our energy security and energy
dominance, and produces high-paying Amer-
ican jobs; provides increased revenue to the
Treasury, States, tribes, and local commu-
nities; and is a critical source of conserva-
tion funding.
H.R. 1146 would prohibit the Department of
the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management
from administering an oil and gas leasing
program in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska.
The bill would repeal a provision of the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that directed the
Secretary of the Interior to establish a pro-
gram for the development of the Coastal
Plain that would allow the use of no more
than about 0.01 percent of the total acreage
of ANWR for surface development of produc-
tion and support facilities. The Administra-
tion supports environmentally responsible
energy development in the Coastal Plain,
also known as the 1002 Area, of ANWR. Such
development is expected to increase Amer-
ica’s energy security and independence, cre-
ate jobs, and provide affordable, reliable en-
ergy for consumers while providing much-
needed revenue to both the State of Alaska
and the Federal Government.
Similarly, H.R. 205 and H.R. 1941 would
both restrict future oil and gas development
in the Federal waters of the U.S. Outer Con-
tinental Shelf (OCS). H.R. 205 would amend
the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act
(GOMESA) to make permanent the current
temporary leasing moratorium on offshore
leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, off the
west coast of Florida. H.R. 1941 would amend
the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act
(OCSLA) to permanently remove from con-
sideration acreage for offshore leasing on
both the Atlantic and Pacific OCS. Both of
these bills would undermine OCSLA, which
established a periodic, multi-stage planning
process involving State and tribal consulta-
tion and a thoughtful comparison and bal-
ancing of the benefits and impacts to all the
regions of the OCS. These bills would perma-
nently constrain this careful administrative
process. Under the bills, large swaths of the
OCS would be off limits for resource develop-
ment without the benefit of periodic assess-
ments of the potential economic, social, and
environmental effects of development, as re-
quired by existing law. Excluding these areas
from leasing consideration could place more
pressure for development on other OCS areas
and constrain our ability to meet national
energy needs as required by OCSLA.
Additionally, each of these bills would

2018, energy development on Federal and In-
dian lands and waters generated approxi-
mately $9 billion in direct revenue from roy-
alties, bonus bids, and rents. Of that rev-
enue, $1.78 billion was disbursed to 35 States.
The top States receiving Fiscal Year 2018
revenues were New Mexico ($634.9 million);
Wyoming ($563.9 million); Colorado ($112.5
million); Louisiana ($91 million); and Utah
($76 million). Additionally, more than $1 bil-
lion was disbursed to Indian tribes and indi-
vidual Indian mineral owners; $1.22 billion to
the Reclamation Fund; $970 million to the
Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF);
$150 million to the Historic Preservation
Fund; and $3.5 billion to the general fund of
the Treasury.
Prohibiting energy development in new
Federal areas would hinder future adminis-
trations’ efforts to make up for revenue lost
as production declines from leases in aging
energy fields. Such restrictions will tie the
hands of future administrations and reduce
their ability to enhance energy security
through strong domestic energy production
and to ensure affordable energy for American
families.
If these bills were presented to the Presi-
dent, his advisors would recommend he veto
them.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I
also include in the RECORD a letter of
strong opposition to the bill by over 20
entities, including the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, Consumer Energy Alliance,
and a letter in opposition from the La-
borers’ International Union of North
America.
SEPTEMBER 5, 2019.
U.S. CONGRESS,
Washington, DC.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: We rely on Amer-
ican made energy to power our daily lives,
communities and to grow a more prosperous
future. Americans deserve clean, safe, reli-
able, abundant and affordable energy so that
our families, communities and businesses
can all share the opportunities American en-
ergy creates. Our country cannot afford to
block access to new energy supplies and risk
losing our energy advantage. That’s why we
ask you to oppose legislation being consid-
ered by the U.S. House of Representatives
next week that would slow scientific surveys
and prevent access to new sources of Amer-
ican offshore energy in the Outer Conti-
nental Shelf.
For more than seven decades, energy devel-
opment in the Gulf of Mexico has worked
collaboratively alongside tourism, fishing
and Defense Department training activities.
But H.R. 205 would permanently extend the
eastern Gulf of Mexico moratorium on oil
and natural gas activities. The Congressional
Budget Office conservatively estimates that
this could cost taxpayers $400 million in rev-
enue over the next 10 years. Similarly, H.R.
1941 would block offshore energy develop-
ment in the Pacific and Atlantic planning
areas, and H.R. 1146 would lock up energy re-
sources in the Alaskan Coastal Plain.
Congress should support progress. Modern
energy technologies have enabled an impres-
sive record of environmental stewardship
and innovation. But when the government
chooses to arbitrarily and permanently close
off areas to exploration and potential devel-
opment, we simply increase our dependency
on foreign sources. This reality is visible in
places like California and Massachusetts.
Despite abundant offshore oil and natural
gas resources, California imports 57 percent
of its oil supply, a staggering 37 percent of
which comes from Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile,
to meet energy needs each winter, Massachu-
setts imports liquefied natural gas from Rus-
sia.
American energy is produced with a small-
er carbon footprint under significantly
stronger environmental protections than en-
ergy produced anywhere else in the world.
We ask you to embrace these homegrown op-
portunities that benefit American families,
create high-wage jobs, strengthen the U.S.
economy and protect our environment.
Next week, the House of Representatives is
expected to consider legislation undercut-
ting domestic energy security and economic
opportunity by limiting American energy ac-
cess. We urge you to reject these bills and in-
stead stand up for energy produced in Amer-
ica, by American workers for the benefit of
American families.

Hon. NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY,
Minority Leader, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: On behalf of the 500,000 mem-
bers of the Laborers’ International Union of
North America (LIUNA), I want to express
our opposition to H.R. 205, which would per-
manently extend the moratorium on oil and
gas leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico;
H.R. 1146, to once again prohibit oil and gas
drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Ref-
uge (ANWR); and, H.R. 1941, which would bar
offshore drilling along the Atlantic and Pa-
cific Coasts.
Once again, jobs of LIUNA members who
work in the energy sector are being targeted
for elimination by environmental radicals
for purely political purposes. There is abso-
lutely no chance for these ‘‘message bills’’ to
be enacted into law this Congress. So, in-
stead of working to enact real job creating
infrastructure legislation, union members
see their jobs once again being denigrated
and belittled.
Energy independence is central to the fu-
ture of the American economy and our
standard of living. Unfortunately, the en-
emies of job creation continue to try to wall
off and strand our domestic energy resources
from development; killing jobs, prolonging
our energy dependence on unfriendly foreign
regimes, and saddling middle-class and
lower-income families with rising energy
costs.
LIUNA members, in Alaska and elsewhere,
know first-hand that when done responsibly,
with union-trained workers, energy develop-
ment can coexist with environmental stew-
ardship. LIUNA and the other building
trades unions invest significant resources
into the training of our members that help
develop the knowledge and skills they need
to work safely and productively while con-
structing energy and other infrastructure to
the highest standards.
For the hard-working members of LIUNA
and other building trades unions, these jobs
put food on their families’ tables and roofs
over their heads. These jobs enable them to
put their children through college, to save
for retirement, and to spend money in busi-
ness establishments that employ others.
I urge you to vote against these ill-con-
ceived bills.
With kind regards, I am
Sincerely yours,
TERRY O’SULLIVAN,
General President.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, may I
ask a question of the ranking member
about how many more speakers he has.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. If the gen-
tleman asks nicely.
Yes. I am waiting for one more
speaker coming over who may or may
not be here.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. He just arrived,
Mr. Chair, so I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Arizona (Mr. GOSAR), who is head of the
Congressional Western Caucus and a
valuable member of our committee.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I thank my
friend and Ranking Member BISHOP for
yielding.
Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition
to this misguided legislation. This leg-
islation will put the United States at a
distinct disadvantage with the rest of
the world by taking some of our coun-
try’s most valuable energy deposits off-
limits to exploration. By the way,
these are the people of the United
States’ resources.
Under the current administration,
America is experiencing an energy ren-
aissance. By taking an all-of-the-above
approach to energy policy, this admin-
istration has kick-started unprece-
dented growth in our energy produc-
tion. For the first time since the 1950s,
the United States will become a net ex-
porter of oil and natural gas, providing
great benefits for our economy and our
national security. However, my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle
want to make these successes short-
term phenomena.
By permanently putting both the At-
lantic and Pacific Outer Continental
Shelves off-limits to oil and gas explo-
ration, this bill ties one hand behind
our Nation’s back. Instead of making
potential bountiful energy deposits off-
limits to development, this Congress
should be interested in making sure
that these deposits are responsibly de-
veloped. Technological advancements
in offshore energy development have
made it safer than ever before.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
oppose this legislation.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, how
much time do I have remaining?
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
California has 41⁄2 minutes remaining.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself the balance of my time to clar-
ify a couple of things that have been
said in this wonderful discussion, and I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7614 September 11, 2019
thank all the speakers for coming be-
fore us.
The sky is not falling. Let me repeat
that: The sky is not falling. It has been
pointed out and reported that if we do
not have drilling in the Atlantic and
Pacific, it will badly hurt the Land and
Water Conservation Fund because it is
funded from offshore revenues. The
idea that the passage of H.R. 1941 will
hurt the LWCF is completely false.
This bill will not affect the LWCF at
all.
Let’s talk about it. All the money for
the LWCF from this fund comes from
the existing oil and gas activities in
the central and western Gulf of Mexico.
Of the resources that come into the
Federal Government from these areas,
the central and western Gulf of Mexico,
the Land and Water Conservation Fund
gets the first $900 million. That is what
comes in, and then it is distributed.
Last year, what came in for the con-
servation fund should have been over
$4.7 billion. In fact, in the last 19 years,
we have brought in, at a minimum, $2.8
billion, far in excess of the $900 million
that goes to the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund.
There are projections that the exist-
ing activity in the Gulf of Mexico is
enough to keep the LWCF funded for
many, many decades to come. We don’t
need to drill in the Atlantic or the Pa-
cific to fund the LWCF. Revenues are
not the problem.
What is the problem then? The real
problem is that only twice in the his-
tory of the LWCF has Congress appro-
priated the full $900 million. As I have
pointed out, much more money has
come into the Treasury. Only twice
have we ever fully appropriated the
money.
b 1330
In fact, we have collected almost $40
billion in revenues that should have
been spent on the LWCF, but we have
appropriated less than half of that,
which is $18.4 billion.
So I am glad that my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle are very con-
cerned about the LWCF, but I would
like to point out that we should make
sure we work together, that we get the
full $900 million that we should be get-
ting every year and that we are not
getting every year.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I
have no further speakers, and I am
ready to close.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I am
ready to close, and reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chair, I appreciate the concern
that the gentleman from California
(Mr. LOWENTHAL) has for the LWCF.
The issue though at hand is not nec-
essarily what we have been appro-
priating for LWCF. The issue at hand is
that you want to triple that amount.
If you are actually going to cut the
potential revenue that is going to come
from these areas, don’t ask to triple it
at the same time. And I would still ask
you—and remind you—I have got a
park backlog bill that I want to have
funded here. Don’t take those funds
away from the park maintenance back-
log. That is far more significant than
what we are talking about.
But the real issue we are having here
is a difference in the approach to the
country’s energy solutions, our future.
You have three disjointed bills, none of
them based on science—a lot of them
based on mythology that we have
heard here today, none of them sci-
entifically based—but they are here in
an isolated way, which the whole goal
is to cut stuff. Let’s just not produce.
Now, at least when Jimmy Carter put
on that sweater and started the fire
and he talked to the American people,
he was at least honest enough with
them to say, You are going to have to
lower your expectations. You won’t be
able to live the lifestyle you want to
have in the future.
At no time has anyone who is pur-
porting this type of an approach that
has been pushed by the Democrats
talked about lowering or being willing
to lower their thermostats in the win-
ter or cut down on their air-condi-
tioning in the summer, or stop driving
their boats as often as they want to, or
no longer going on planes, trains, and
automobiles.
Now, they just expect—miracu-
lously—energy to be produced by other
areas that they can then enjoy it in
some particular way. That is not a log-
ical approach. It can be done, but it is
not a logical approach. It doesn’t just
miraculously happen.
The difference is, what the Repub-
licans have placed on the table today is
an overall approach to energy, a com-
prehensive approach to energy. Not
just a comprehensive approach of how
we build on our fossil fuels, but also
how we build alternative energy and
how we involve the States in that con-
cept, because every State has a dif-
ferent requirement, a different initia-
tive, and a different need. And we are
trying to do that, not some one-size-
fits-all blanket approach as we are
going to have in this bill and the third
bill that we will actually have tomor-
row.
The approach the Democrats are
doing is saying we won’t develop Amer-
ican sources because we might spill. In-
stead, we will try to rely on, maybe,
them coming from somewhere else.
Some of our colleagues have already
talked about how the Russians are al-
ready importing into Boston. How Cali-
fornia is already getting 57 percent of
its energy coming from Saudi Arabia,
and they come in tankers.
And, Mr. Chairman, the problem is
that we fail to realize, if you really
want to have a higher mathematical
possibility of oil spills, it is signifi-
cantly higher when it comes from
tankers than it is if we do our own
drilling.
So not only are we not talking about
being self-sufficient, not only are we
not talking about now trying to be a
source of support for our allies, not
only are we not trying to be somewhere
where we can be a major player in this
world, we are going to cut back auto-
matically and actually make a greater
risk in the process of doing it.
This is a silly approach, and it con-
trasts specifically with what we are at-
tempting to do. We can have jobs and
we can have a future. And we can have
a country that will no longer be bullied
by other countries, seeing that we are
energy-weak, if we approach it the way
the Republicans want to approach it.
But if we still do this disjointed, dis-
pirited, nonscientific approach based
on more myth than reality, then, actu-
ally, we are going in the opposite direc-
tion.
The Democrats in their energy-weak-
ness, would march us back 50 years to
a time when America was much more
fragile and in which second-rate powers
thought they could bully us into sub-
mission simply by taking advantage of
our lack of a strong, coherent energy
policy. And that is what Republicans
do not want to see happen again.
And that is why I would urge you all
to look at the bill that was introduced
today—the Republican approach to it.
That is the way of the future.
It is bright. It is big. It is positive. It
moves us forward. Not what we are
doing today with a bunch of bills that
piece-by-piece take us back from where
we came, and we should never return
again.
Mr. Chairman, with that, I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I just, in closing, would like to make
a few statements that kind of reiterate
what has already been said, I think so
well, and how we must protect our
coast.
Right now, the United States pro-
duces, in totality, 12.3 million barrels
of oil a day—crude oil, each and every
day. It is an all-time U.S. record. We
have done that in 2018, and we lead the
world now in terms of export produc-
tion.
Of that 12.3 million, we export over 3
million barrels of crude oil a day. It is
more than is exported from all the
other nations of the world, except for
two OPEC nations.
We are the number one producer of
natural gas. We are a net exporter of
natural gas, but we also say we do—by
not opening up the Atlantic and the
Pacific, we are not putting this tre-
mendous resource of oil development
at risk. Right now, in the Gulf, open
for development in the future, we nor-
mally put up almost 80 million acres in
the Gulf for leasing each year.
Right now over 72 percent of the po-
tential Gulf that is open for oil and gas
development, 72 percent has not yet
been developed. There is an estimated
43 billion barrels of oil in the Gulf yet

to be discovered and produced. There is
enough oil there for the next 66 years
of production at the same level that we
have today. We must protect our coast.
We must protect the future.
Mr. Chair, I urge swift adoption of
H.R. 1941, and I yield back the remain-
der of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chair, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in opposition to H.R. 1941,
which will block oil and natural gas lease sales
in the Atlantic and Pacific.
To start, this bill reduces the United States’
ability to develop our domestic energy re-
sources. Furthermore, it emboldens Russia to
continue to use its oil and gas as a weapon
against Europe.
At a time when Putin is using all available
tools to sow discord and chaos around the
world especially in Europe and the Middle
East, we need to work together to stop him
from further harming our national security in-
terests and those of our allies. This bill is a
step in the wrong direction and will further em-
power Putin
In addition to this bill’s geo-political ramifica-
tions, it also ignores the fact that American en-
ergy extraction technology and techniques are
the best in the world. Inhibiting U.S. energy
production will create a void for Russia and
others to fill with their more ecologically dam-
aging methods, while also sacrificing American
jobs.
Based on the negative effects H.R. 1941 will
have on global security, the environment, and
our economy, I urge my colleagues to oppose
this bill.
The CHAIR. All time for general de-
bate has expired.
Pursuant to the rule, an amendment
in the nature of a substitute consisting
of the text of the Rules Committee
Print 116–31, modified by the amend-
ment printed in part E of House Report

AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR. MCCLINTOCK
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 1 printed in part
F of House Report 116–200.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate
the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 1, line 12-13, strike ‘‘or the Pacific Re-
gion planning areas,’’.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 548, the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman,
this amendment removes the Pacific
Coast for the total moratorium on oil
exploration imposed under this legisla-
tion.
It will make my California Demo-
cratic colleagues’ heads explode, but
there are also many other reasons to
support this amendment.
California is already pursuing these
Green New Deal policies pioneered by
Jerry Brown and Arnold
Schwarzenegger, and Californians are
now paying among the highest elec-
tricity and gasoline prices in the coun-
try as a result.
In the last decade, while U.S. oil pro-
duction has grown 130 percent, it has
declined in California by 20 percent. In
2000, California produced 50 percent of
the petroleum it consumed every
year—50 percent. That figure is now
down to 30 percent.
In 2000, California imported 25 per-
cent of its oil from foreign countries.
Today, it imports 60 percent. In just
the last year, California’s oil purchases
from Saudi Arabia ballooned from 98
million barrels to 135 million barrels.
These foolish policies are contributing
to one of the highest unemployment
rates, the largest homeless population,
and the highest effective poverty rate
in our Nation.
Yet, leasing the 240 million acres
that are currently off limits could sup-
port an additional 165,000 jobs and in-
ject $15 billion into our economy every

H7616 September 11, 2019
These policies are also contributing
to the lowest unemployment rates for
Americans of African and Hispanic her-
itage in our Nation’s history, rising
wages after an entire lost decade of
economic stagnation, and an overall
rate of economic growth almost twice
what we are seeing in Europe or that
we saw under the Obama Administra-
tion.
And let us consider the environment.
California’s coastal waters suffer from
natural oil seepage of 86,000 barrels a
year into the Pacific Ocean, the equiv-
alent of one Santa Barbara oil spill
every year. Development of our off-
shore resources reduces the pressure
that produces seepage.
Having grown up in coastal Ventura
County 50 years ago, I can tell you
firsthand of the conspicuous decline in
natural seepage that has occurred in
the years since the Channel Islands
field opened. And lest we forget, it is
the abundance of natural gas that has
reduced our country’s carbon dioxide
emissions far below what expensive and
oppressive government regulation has
accomplished in Europe.
California leads the Nation?
Let me repeat: While our Nation’s oil
production is up 130 percent, Califor-
nia’s is down 20 percent. While our Na-
tion has achieved energy independence,
California’s reliance on foreign oil has
more than doubled. That is trailing the
Nation, not leading it.
My State, that has among the most
bountiful oil and natural gas resources
in the Nation, has the least political
will to develop them. I offer this
amendment to highlight this point and
to warn the rest of the Nation where it
leads. And also—let’s be honest—to
watch my California Democratic col-
leagues set their hair on fire.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time so we can now watch. And I
am ready to close when they are.
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Chair, I
rise in opposition to the amendment of-
fered by the gentleman from California
(Mr. MCCLINTOCK).
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
California is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Chair,
there is absolutely no sense in making
a special exception to open the waters
along the Pacific Coast for drilling.
Supporters of this amendment clear-
ly represent districts many miles from
the nearest coastline. Maybe they
never saw the environmental devasta-
tion on southern California beaches
after the Santa Barbara Plains oil spill
in 2015; maybe they haven’t visited
with small businesses in coastal com-
munities like mine that depend on
tourism and recreation to survive;
maybe they don’t know that offshore
drilling threatens nearly 746,000 jobs
and nearly $53 billion in GDP along the
West Coast.
However, I have seen that devasta-
tion. I visited those small businesses.
And I am well-aware of how many jobs
could and would be lost if we suffer
from another spill along the Pacific
Coast. I also know that more than 90
West Coast municipalities and all three
Pacific Coast State governors formally
oppose offshore drilling.
The people I represent in San Diego
and Orange County certainly do as
well. They know that the risks far out-
weigh any benefit that fossil fuel com-
panies will reap from drilling off our
coast, and I am here to raise their
voices.
Mr. Chair, many of my Republican
colleagues in the Committee on Nat-
ural Resources try to justify their push
to destroy our coastal communities
with offshore drilling by claiming that
the alternative to expanded drilling is
imported foreign oil.
If my friends on the other side of the
aisle were serious about addressing oil
imports, they would not sit idly by as
the Trump administration works to
completely undermine our country’s
fuel efficiency standards.
If they were serious, they would sup-
port the State of California as it works
to strengthen fuel economy, so that
this country is not dependent on oil,
period. And so that Americans can save
money at the pump.
California is working to reduce oil
imports with its vehicle emissions
standards and low carbon fuel stand-
ard, but the Trump administration is
fighting tooth and nail to stop it by re-
voking the State’s Clean Air Act waiv-
er and challenging its groundbreaking
agreement with automakers to set
strong standards.
Those who support the Trump admin-
istration’s efforts are hitting my con-
stituents—not once, but twice. First,
they are making cars less efficient,
which drives climate change and hurts
air quality in southern California. And
now, supporters of this amendment are
seeking to increase the chances of an
environmental catastrophe that could
do irreparable damage to my constitu-
ents’ communities and our local econ-
omy.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to recognize the
impact that this amendment will have
on Pacific Coast economies by strongly
opposing it.
I yield back the balance of my time.
b 1345
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chair, I read-
ily concede that this amendment is
anathema to the ruling elite in Sac-
ramento. They have had their way with
California. The policies they advocate
on the House floor today are the same
policies they have inflicted on my once
Golden State during my lifetime.
Those policies have produced the
highest effective poverty rate in the
Nation, among the highest energy
prices in the country, and a historic ex-
odus of Californians fleeing to other
States.
The road to Venezuela leads through
California, and I urge the rest of the
Nation to ask themselves: Is that real-
ly a road they want to take?
We went down that road in the 1970s.
The bill’s author is, perhaps, too young
to remember those dark days when our
Nation was held hostage to foreign oil,
when cars lined up for blocks to get gas
and every meeting of the OPEC nations
was a national crisis.
I check the daily AAA survey of gas-
oline prices. Today, in California, the
average price of a gallon of regular gas-
oline is $3.63. In South Carolina, it is
$2.23. That is a $1.40-a-gallon difference,
and I ask the bill’s author from South
Carolina to consider if his constituents
are ready to enact California policies
and then pay for them through the noz-
zle.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The CHAIR. The question is on the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK).
The amendment was rejected.
AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. GOSAR
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 2 printed in part
F of House Report 116–200.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate
the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 1, beginning on line 2, strike ‘‘COAST-
AL AND MARINE ECONOMIES PROTECTION’’ and
insert ‘‘RUSSIAN ENERGY RELIANCE AND UNITED
STATES POVERTY’’.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 548, the gentleman from Arizona
(Mr. GOSAR) and a Member opposed
each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Arizona.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I rise today
to offer an amendment that changes
the title of this legislation to some-
thing more fitting, that being the
‘‘Russian Energy Reliance and United
States Poverty Act.’’
The consequences of this legislation
becoming law would have devastating,
long-term impacts on the economic
and national security of the United
States. Putting both the Atlantic and
Pacific Outer Continental Shelves per-
manently off-limits to oil and gas de-
velopment puts the United States at a
distinct disadvantage to the rest of the
world.
We have already seen how policies
from liberal States that are along the
same lines of this legislation have
caused certain parts of the country to
become dependent upon Russian en-
ergy. New England, for example, was
forced to import Russian natural gas in
the wintertime because of the ludi-
crous decision by the State of New
York not to allow pipelines to be built
through the State.
The legislation before us today would
have similar consequences. As existing
oil and gas deposits begin to run dry,
new deposits will need to be extracted,
many of which are located on the Pa-
cific and Atlantic Outer Continental
Shelves.
Putting these deposits off-limits
would cause us to go back to the old
days of the old normal that had become

commonplace under the previous ad-
ministration. The old normal of relying
on foreign adversaries such as Russia
to meet our energy needs is prepos-
terous.
The Members across the aisle may
try to hide their intentions, but they
are becoming clearer every day. They
want to dismantle our domestic oil and
gas industry, an industry that employs
close to 10 million people and plays a
critical role in our Nation’s energy se-
curity.
Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to
support this amendment so that the
American people are aware of the true
ramifications of this misguided legisla-
tion, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I rise
in opposition to the amendment.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
California is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, this is a pointless amend-
ment, and I am, frankly, a little bit
embarrassed that we are even dis-
cussing it. Not only does it not im-
prove the bill, but it is also based on a
false premise.
Let’s be clear: We are not reliant on
Russian energy, and the United States
is not stricken by energy poverty. In
fact, it is the complete opposite of the
present reality.
The Atlantic and Pacific have re-
mained off-limits to new oil and gas de-
velopment for decades, but the United
States now produces 12.3 million bar-
rels of crude oil each day, which is an
all-time U.S. record, and it produces
the most in the world. It exports over
3 million barrels of crude oil a day,
more than all but two members of
OPEC exported in 2018.
We are the number three exporter of
oil. We are also the number one pro-
ducer of natural gas in the world, and
we are a net exporter of natural gas.
Look, if we really want to lead in en-
ergy, we should be taking a bigger role
in the production of renewable energy.
Costs for renewable energy have plum-
meted, and our global competitors are
jockeying to lead the world in clean en-
ergy development.
Unfortunately, Republicans seem to
have dusted off the same tired talking
points that they were using 10 years
ago—and even longer, 20 years ago—be-
fore U.S. energy production sky-
rocketed.
Even worse, the Trump administra-
tion acts like it believes those talking
points and continues to believe that
the future lies in coal, oil, and gas.
Mr. Chair, this is a silly amendment,
and it achieves nothing. For this rea-
son, I urge opposition to the amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I find it in-
teresting that we are even debating
this because, if it was such a poor deci-
sion, maybe the Rules Committee
should not have made it in order. So,
there is compliance from the other
side.
When we start looking at this aspect,
we have to be truthful to the American
people. The American people see the
jargon that we actually come up with
in this body, and they want to have a
straight shot—common sense. This is
exactly what it should be titled be-
cause we are taking inventory off that
belonged to the American people.
Yes, I am one of those who believes
in all-of-the-above energy policies.
What we have to tell them and explain
to them is that there is a difference be-
tween baseload power and intermittent
power.
Renewables do not have baseline
power. To have a reliable electric grid
that everybody depends upon, we have
to have both. Green energy does not
produce that application of baseload
power, unless we are talking about
hydro, and that we don’t even consider
a green energy anymore, from the
other side.
I think we need to be clear to the
American people where these jobs are.
They are good-paying jobs, $90,000 and
above with benefits.
When we take away these types of re-
serves, it really is victimizing the
American people. That is not some-
thing I want to do. I want to make sure
that they are empowered.
These resources belong to the Amer-
ican people, and there is no reason why
we shouldn’t be able to use them and
extract them diligently and cleanly.
Mr. Chair, I ask everybody to vote
for this, to be clear to the American
public what this stands for, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I op-
pose the Gosar amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
The CHAIR. The question is on the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR).
The question was taken; and the

peared to have it.

Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Chair, I have an

The text of the amendment is as fol-

At the end of the bill, add the following:
SEC. 5. RISK TO NATIONAL SECURITY.
The Secretary of the Interior, after con-
sulting with the Secretary of Defense, shall
report to Congress on whether this Act poses
a risk to national security due to potential
increase in dependence on foreign oil.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 548, the gentlewoman from Ari-
zona (Mrs. LESKO) and a Member op-
posed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Arizona.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Chair, my amend-
ment would require the Department of
the Interior, in consultation with the
Department of Defense, to report on
whether the policies of this bill would
put our national security at risk.
There are many reasons to support
domestic energy production, many rea-
sons to oppose the bans this bill pro-
poses, but I believe chief among them
is that harnessing the natural re-
sources our country has been blessed
with makes our Nation and our allies
safer.
American energy production makes
us less reliant on foreign actors. More
American oil means we will less likely
have to use Saudi Arabian oil. More
American natural gas means our allies
are less likely to rely on Russian nat-
ural gas.
Our homes, factories, and vehicles
need energy. Our allies need energy. As
our world grows, so will our demand.
Oil and natural gas are estimated to
comprise 60 percent of global demand
in 2050. The question is, where will the
United States get it? Will we take it
from our own shores, or will we rely on
OPEC, whose Arab petroleum-export-
ing countries previously stopped oil
shipments to the United States and
caused gas prices to soar and threat-
ened our national security.
I support an all-of-the-above ap-
proach, which includes solar, wind, hy-
dropower, nuclear, and coal. I also sup-
port domestic oil and natural gas. I be-
lieve an all-of-the-above energy ap-
proach benefits American pocketbooks
and quality of life and, especially, our
security.
Mr. Chair, I urge support of my
amendment because I believe our gov-
ernment should fully understand the
security risks these bans in these bills
entail, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I claim
the time in opposition, although I am
not opposed.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. LAWSON of
Florida). Without objection, the gen-
tleman from California is recognized
for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, we do
not have any concerns with the amend-
ment and do not believe it undermines
the underlying legislation.
Furthermore, it is our firm belief
that, if the Department of the Interior
were to consult with the Defense De-
partment, they would find H.R. 1941
poses no national security risk to the
United States.
The underlying bill does not affect a
single producing offshore lease, and oil
and gas companies now have tremen-
dous opportunities for new offshore de-
velopment in the United States.
Let’s be clear: The United States of-
fers nearly 80 million acres in the Gulf
of Mexico for new leasing every year,
and companies now hold only 13 mil-
lion acres of the Gulf under lease,
which means that 72 percent of the
acres that have been offered are not
yet developed.

Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-

Add at the end the following:
SEC. 5. STUDYING THE IMPACTS OF OFFSHORE
DRILLING ON COASTAL COMMU-
NITIES AND COASTAL ECONOMIES.
(a) REPORT.—Not later than one year after
the date of enactment of this Act, the Comp-
troller General shall submit to the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources of the House of
Representatives and the Committee on En-
ergy and Natural Resources of the Senate a
report on the impacts of offshore drilling on
coastal communities and coastal economies.
(b) CONTENTS.—The report required by sub-
section (a) shall—
(1) address how oil and gas companies
interact with local stakeholders in advance
of a siting decision, including their meetings
with fishermen;
(2) investigate the impacts of offshore
drilling on tourism, including tradeoffs dur-
ing normal operations and economic impacts
after a spill;
(3) describe how the Bureau of Ocean En-
ergy Management works with other agen-
cies, including the National Marine Fisheries
Service, to include stakeholder input in ad-
vance of a siting decision;
(4) address how quickly response teams can
mitigate environmental damage after a spill
and how long regional ecosystems take to re-
cover following a spill;
(5) describe any limitations on the quan-
tity of comparative data available on im-
pacts to regions of the Outer Continental
Shelf that have not been sited for drilling;
(6) describe the impacts on commercial and
recreational fisheries from offshore drilling;
and
(7) address the economic impacts of oil
spills on the food supply of a region, includ-
ing those food sources that are distinctive to
a region’s culture.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 548, the gentleman
from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN) and
a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Rhode Island.
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, the
Atlantic Coast has never been a site of
significant offshore drilling, and for
good reason. In my home State of
Rhode Island and all along the coast,
we know the importance of these
waters to tourism and to the fisheries
that they sustain. Indeed, waterways
are part of our way of life. It is part of
our identity and who we are.
This amendment will instruct GAO
to perform a study on the costs and the
impacts of drilling on the coastal com-
munities and their economies. This
study will address how oil and gas com-
panies interact with local stake-
holders, including fishermen. It will ex-
plore how the Interior Department’s
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management
works with other Federal agencies dur-
ing siting. It will examine how re-
sponse teams have reacted to offshore
oil spills and the cost of those spills to
tourism and the food supply of the af-
fected region.
And finally, it will analyze the cal-
iber of the data that we have on hand
today regarding these undrilled areas
of the Outer Continental Shelf, and
whether such data can be reliably used
to gauge the impact of proposed drill-
ing.
These are all questions that have
arisen during my conversations with
fishermen, tourism leaders, and other
Rhode Islanders deeply concerned
about the risks of drilling off our coast.
Mr. Chairman, I believe that offshore
drilling puts the safety of our water-
ways at risk, which we have seen from
numerous spills over the years, includ-
ing the devastating Deepwater Horizon
blowout.
We owe it to those who live in our
coastal communities to be honest
about the damage that such drilling
can cause to them.
Mr. Chairman, it will take decades to
recover from an incident like the one
we experienced with the Deepwater Ho-
rizon spill. While the news cycle even-
tually moves on, the coastal commu-
nities and the people that are affected
have to deal with the consequences and
often continue to suffer.
That is why I am putting forward
this amendment today, so that we can
properly understand the full costs of
drilling off our coast.
I would like to thank Congressman
CUNNINGHAM from South Carolina for
sponsoring the underlying bill, and I
urge my colleagues to support it and
my amendment.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman,
I rise in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. This amend-
ment is perhaps well-intentioned. I am
going to make that assumption. But
the problem with this amendment is it
is not a comprehensive amendment.
The goal of this amendment is to spe-
cifically illustrate what kinds of issues
will be studied by this GAO report, and
they are all the negative aspects that
could come from this report.
There is no aspect here, I mean, it
neglects totally to try and set any kind
of benefits that would happen from de-
velopment of oil or gas consumer. Now,
that would be a true study. That would
be a fair study. That would be a good
study. That would be a valuable study.
What this has done, in a statement of
what will be considered, basically
skewed what the GAO will do, so you
have come up with a predetermined
outset. We can predict exactly what
will come out from this study because
it is not comprehensive and it hasn’t
tried to be inclusive.
What you should have done is simply
direct the GAO to evaluate how taking
resources off the table like this will af-
fect our dependence on imports from
foreign actors like Russia, whose envi-
ronmental standards, whose efficiency
standards, and whose human rights
standards certainly are unacceptable
to us in the United States. Doing so—
if you had done that, that would have
been a comprehensive, that would have
been an accurate representation, and
that would have been a good and de-
cent study.
So I oppose this particular amend-
ment because I think it missed the
mark.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentleman for his comments
and his insights. I see that this amend-
ment gets exactly the right informa-
tion that we need. I am certainly not
opposed to the gentleman’s suggestion,
and if at a later date he is going to
offer such additional information to be
gathered by GAO, I would certainly
like to look at it and perhaps even sup-
port it.
But this is the amendment that we
have before us. I believe it is well
thought out. Again, it is a GAO study
to perform—to look at the costs and
the impacts of drilling on coastal com-
munities, which my community would
be directly affected, and how they
would be affected and their economies.
And I think having more information
is better. I think this hits the right
mark, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port it.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman,
in the original speech the gentleman
from Rhode Island said he yielded back
the balance of his time. Had he not
yielded in the first speech?
Mr. LANGEVIN. I reserved the bal-
ance of my time, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I am sorry. Had
that actually been said after the first
speech, I would have reserved. But I
have yielded back. I am done with this.
Unless you really want to go on, I
would urge the gentleman to yield
back and we will go on with the vote.
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I
have said everything I need to say, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LAN-
GEVIN).

from California (Mr. ROUDA) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Chairman, the
Coastal and Marine Economies Protec-
tion Act requires existing offshore oil
and gas operations to undergo inspec-
tions and make payments into the
Ocean Energy Safety Fund. My amend-
ment would make this information
available to the public.
The Trump administration’s 2018 pro-
posed opening of more than 90 percent
of U.S. Federal waters to offshore oil
could endanger at least 42,000 miles of
our Atlantic and Pacific coasts to the
extreme risks posed by offshore drill-
ing and spilling.
I came to Congress to advocate on be-
half of the people living in my coastal
district. The American people have a
vested interest in the health of their
environment and the wealth of their
local communities. It is essential that
the public is aware of the companies
who are extracting oil from our shores
so that we can hold them accountable
in the event of a disaster or an acci-
dent.
Offshore drilling impacts more than
just coastal communities; it impacts
future generations of Americans.
Transparency is a key democratic prin-
ciple. Citizens deserve to know which
companies are drilling off our shores,
the location of their facilities, and the
safety and state of their operations.
In Orange County, this critical legis-
lation helps make sure generations can
come and continue to sail Newport
Harbor, become junior lifeguards, surf
the Wedge, catch halibut, and enjoy
our pristine breaches.
This legislation is essential to main-
taining our quality of life, and I thank
my colleague from South Carolina for
his leadership.
I urge my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle to support my amendment
and passage of this bill.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman,
I claim the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman,
I guess kind of in opposition. It really
is not in opposition to the amendment
in and of itself, except it illustrates
some of the problems the Democrats
have in creating this approach to an
energy policy coming through here, be-
cause the inspection fees that we have
mandated by the amendment, if you
tack it on to the bill itself, really are
based on politics and not the cost of
the administration of this particular
inspection. In fact, it actually no
longer becomes a cost of a service; it
actually becomes a tax levied on the
committee.
What it illustrates is a deeper prob-
lem on how the Democrats decided to
put these three bills up here on their
energy week, and it also maybe indi-
cates why they don’t really expect it to
go any further, because the offsets are
so bizarre.
In each of the bills, the Democrats
have decided to use—the rules require
an offset. In each of the bills, there is
a different offset that is required. For
the one that we will talk about tomor-
row, it is going to be $900 million. I
think this one is $400 million. The next
one is $200 million. And in each bill,
the Democrats have decided to use the
same offset to pay for each bill.
Now, ironically, if you did the one to-
morrow and then you paid for the bill
with that offset, then you would have
taken that off the table. But that is
not good enough here. Now we are
using that same offset money to pay
for this particular bill.
I am sorry. This is simply an ac-
counting smoke and mirrors trick that
is being used by the Democrats to actu-
ally get these three bills onto the floor.
For that, I don’t really mind it, per se,
because it doesn’t affect the impact of
it, but it is a sneaky way of trying to
cover the bases and check the boxes
and using money in double and triple
amounts.
If this offset is actually the way we
are doing offsets in the future, then my
parks bill doesn’t have a problem going
forward because we can use this money
for that at the same time.
Although, it is ironic that the money
that they are going to use to offset
these bills will be reduced because you
are stopping the energy production in
all of these areas. Everything comes
together in some particular way.
This is cute. This is not necessarily
effective, but it is cute, and it is not
the way the rules for offsets were in-
tended to try and bring clarity to the
situation within the House.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Chairman, I appre-
ciate my colleague’s comments, and I
do appreciate, I think, and I hear from
him that the other side does support
transparency and accountability,
which is welcomed in today’s atmos-
phere of politics to have greater trans-
parency and accountability.
I am prepared to close, but I will re-
serve the balance of my time until my
colleague is prepared to close as well.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman,
I will make it easier for him.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. ROUDA. I yield back the balance
of my time as well, Mr. Chair.

Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair-

lishes a moratorium on seismic testing
in the Atlantic Ocean.
I would like to begin by thanking my
friends, Chairman LOWENTHAL, Chair-
man GRIJALVA, and Congressman
CUNNINGHAM, for leading this bill and
for working with me on this provision.
I also thank my cosponsors, Congress-
men SMITH, BEYER, and VAN DREW, for

their partnership and for their long-
standing commitments to leading on
this issue.
During seismic testing, ships pull
giant airguns through the ocean that
release loud, pressurized blasts of air
into the seafloor in search of oil and
gas. The best evidence from scientists
tells us that noise from these airguns
can disturb, injure, or kill marine ani-
mals from zooplankton, the base of the
food web, all the way up to large
whales. In addition, airgun noise can
reduce catch rates for fish and disrupt
essential behaviors in marine mam-
mals, including dolphins and whales.
I believe we need to be building a
clean energy future, but seismic airgun
blasts lay the groundwork for more
dangerous fossil fuel extraction that is
bad for our economy and for the envi-
ronment.
I am proud to support H.R. 1941, the
Coastal and Marine Economies Protec-
tion Act, because I share the concerns
of so many of my own constituents who
have reached out to me urging Con-
gress to reject proposals that open our
waters and coastlines to expanded off-
shore drilling.
In the 7 years following the 2010 BP
Deepwater Horizon disaster, the U.S.
oil and gas industry experienced more
than 4,000 explosions, collisions, and re-
lated incidents, including 34 oil spills
of more than 2,000 gallons each.
This bill will help us end these disas-
ters once and for all, and I thank my
friend Congressman CUNNINGHAM for
his leadership here. My bipartisan
amendment takes an extra step to
make this legislation stronger yet.
Even if we ban offshore drilling, the
Department of the Interior’s Bureau of
Ocean Energy Management, BOEM,
could still issue permits for seismic
testing in the Atlantic. We know, for
example, that BOEM is currently re-
viewing applications from seismic test-
ing companies looking for oil and gas
beneath the Atlantic Ocean floor.
A legal prohibition on seismic test-
ing, which my amendment includes, is
the surest way to prevent such testing
in the Atlantic, protecting our environ-
ment, marine life, and the health, safe-
ty, and livelihoods of millions of people
involved in tourism, recreation, fish-
ing, and associated sectors. My bipar-
tisan amendment is about saving the
whales for sure, but it is also about
saving people, saving our economy, and
saving our planet.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman,
I rise in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Utah is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman,
I am opposed to this amendment sim-
ply because the seismic activity that
we are talking about has not been up-
dated since the 1980s. So the biggest
problem we have in here is, if you are
going to do it with the Atlantic, you
are doing this in the darkness of not
actually understanding or knowing
what the scientific results will be, and
this will eliminate that permanently.
So the technology for seismic studies
has improved significantly over the
years and is getting better at all times,
but now we have a situation where the
underlying bill stopped production on
these lands, and this amendment would
stop any scientific study to know what
we could have done or what we should
do at this time.
But it is a little bit more insidious
than that because this amendment
only stops seismic study for oil and gas
development; it doesn’t stop seismic
study for anything else.
So, if, indeed, the argument is that
the seismic study hurts the animals,
that Flipper is offended by these seis-
mic studies, all this amendment does is
say Flipper can be offended and harmed
if you are going to put in a windmill,
but Flipper can’t be offended and
harmed if you are going to put in an oil
rig. And no one really knows, because
we won’t do the study, whether Flipper
is going to be offended. For all we
know, Flipper is out there laughing at
us right now for going through this
silly exercise.
But this amendment is not com-
prehensive, it doesn’t meet the need,
and it stops us once again from doing
any science to know about it. So once
again, this bill, these approaches, this
is politics. This is not science. This is
pure politics. For that reason, I oppose
the amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair-
man, I thank my colleague for his com-
ments. I would only point out that the
seismic testing involved in preparing
for possible offshore wind is orders of
magnitude less disruptive. It is not at
all comparable to the seismic testing
done for oil and gas exploration, and it
doesn’t have an anywhere similar level
of harm, and that is why it is a dif-
ferent matter.
I appreciate the gentleman’s com-
ments, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman,
I yield such time as he may consume to
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.
GOSAR).
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentleman from Utah for yielding.
Part of this body’s responsibility is
the public charge of looking at the re-
sources of the American people. These
resources do not belong to a single
State, whether it be South Carolina,
California, New Jersey, Wyoming or
anything else. These are the public
charge of the American people to this
body of Congress, and part of the public
charge is to understand what type of
resources and the value those resources
have to that public charge in regard to
the people of this country.
So doing our due diligence, it is a
mandatory aspect that we undertake
this charge to understand what that re-
sponsibility is to the American people.
In some of the next amendments, you
will actually see some of that public
charge in that regard.
This is an undertaking that is spe-
cifically null and void based upon what
we owe the American people for the
due diligence of this body in regard to
the ownership of which they have of
the Outer Continental Shelf. The mag-
nitude is of inconsequential applica-
tion. I ask everybody to vote against
this amendment.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from Virginia (Mr. BEYER), my es-
teemed colleague.
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I would
like to thank my colleague, Mr. LEVIN,
for his leadership on this amendment.
I have been invested in this issue
throughout my time in Congress, and
earlier this year my Republican col-
league, Chris Smith, and I introduced
the Atlantic Seismic Airgun Protec-
tion Act, a standalone bill that would
amend the Outer Continental Shelf
Lands Act to prohibit oil, gas, and
methane hydrate-related seismic ac-
tivities in the North Atlantic, Mid-At-
lantic, South Atlantic, and Straits of
Florida. This amendment would do just
that.
Our coastal economy relies on
healthy ocean ecosystems that gen-
erate $95 billion in gross domestic prod-
uct every year and support nearly 1.4
million jobs every year.
Seismic blasting poses a major threat
to marine life, including the critically
endangered North Atlantic right whale,
which is on the verge of extinction. Be-
cause they are extremely loud, these
dynamite-like blasts are likely to have
significant, long-lasting, widespread
impacts on the behavior and survival of
fish and marine mammal populations.
If these are impacted, it is a serious
danger to our coastal economies.
This amendment will protect our ma-
rine life and our coastal economies,
and I encourage my colleagues to vote
‘‘yes’’ on this amendment.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair-
man, I thank my colleague for his tre-
mendous leadership on this issue.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman,
I yield myself the balance of my time.
Once again, as we talk about seismic,
realize there is a different approach to
it. Not this administration, but the
prior administration said there is no
scientific policy that says any seismic
study actually hurts any of the ani-
mals, whether it is for fossil fuels or it
is for alternative types of energy.
But the issue at hand is, if you are
going to try and deny any seismic so
you don’t have any studies and we are
going to go in the darkness and not
really know what we are talking about,
then you do it for everything. To try
and distinguish between oil and gas
and alternatives is simply an arbitrary
reason that has no purpose in being
there.
However, if the underlying bill passes
and you are not going to be drilling

there anyway—in which case we basi-
cally say as a Congress we don’t care
about understanding what we are
doing, we are just thinking it is the
right thing to do, so we will go ahead
and do it—this is bad policy. It is bad
policy for the underlying bill. It is bad
policy for the amendment.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Chair, I rise
today in support of the Levin-Beyer-Smith-Van
Drew amendment to H.R. 1941, the Coastal
and Marine Economies Protection Act. This
amendment, which I’m proud to cosponsor,
would ensure that H.R. 1941 not only pro-
scribes future oil and gas leases of the Outer
Continental Shelf in the Atlantic and Pacific
planning areas but also prohibits any seismic
activities in the Atlantic Ocean planning areas.
Seismic activities are performed to first test
for the possibility of oil and gas but in and of
themselves, these activities pose countless
risks to marine life and, by extension, our fish-
ing industries and the health of our coastal
ecosystems. Seismic airgun blasting in par-
ticular can deafen or seriously maim marine
wildlife which rely upon sonar power for move-
ment and can significantly affect local fish
populations, which in turn harms New Jersey’s
fisheries as well as the fishing industry—a vital
contributor to the economic well-being of my
district on the Jersey Shore.
I have continuously stated my strong oppo-
sition to offshore drilling and have made it
clear that the people of New Jersey do not
want oil rigs offshore, and we do not want our
pristine beaches and waters at risk from oil
spills.
I encourage my colleagues to support this
amendment to H.R. 1941 and to support the
underlying bill.

AMENDMENT NO. 7 OFFERED BY MR. GOSAR
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 7 printed in
part F of House Report 116–200.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of the bill, insert the following:
SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.
Section 2 of this Act shall not be effective
until the Secretary of the Interior, in con-
sultation with the Secretary of Labor, finds
that the prohibition under section 2 will not
adversely affect jobs available to minorities
and women.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 548, the gentleman
from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Arizona.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today to offer an amendment that al-
lows the section 2 moratorium in this
bill to go into effect when the Depart-
ment of the Interior, in consultation
with the Department of Labor, certifies
that the offshore energy moratorium in
the bill will not kill a substantial num-
ber of minority and women jobs.
Under the current administration,
unemployment has reached record
lows. In August, the national unem-
ployment rate sat at 3.7 percent, with
the unemployment rate for African
American workers sitting at 5.5 per-
cent, breaking the previous record of
5.9 percent which was set in May of 2018
under the same administration.
According to a recent jobs report
from The Washington Post—hardly a
bastion of conservative credentialing—
nearly 90 percent of the jobs added
under this administration have gone to
minority communities. This is as-
tounding. This can be attributed to the
first time a majority of new hires are
people between the ages of 25 and 54,
and they are from the minority com-
munities.
According to statistics published by
the American Petroleum Institute, mi-
norities will comprise one-third of the
total workforce in the oil and gas sec-
tor by 2030. Women already comprise
more than 15 percent of the oil and gas
workforce. These are good-paying jobs,
paying $90,000, that hardworking fami-
lies depend upon.
This legislation puts these employ-
ment opportunities at risk by putting
off limits potentially viable and valu-
able offshore energy opportunities in
the eastern Gulf of Mexico that are the
property of the American people.
For the first time since the 1950s, the
United States will soon be a net ex-
porter of oil and natural gas, some-
thing that at one time was unthink-
able. America’s energy renaissance has
boosted the economies of previously
left-behind towns throughout the coun-
try and turned them into vibrant com-
munities.
Mr. Chairman, this commonsense
amendment protects minority and
women jobs and puts the interests of
the American workforce first and fore-
most. It is very clear-cut, something
that the American people can fully un-
derstand.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I
rise in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from California is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chair, this amendment has noth-
ing to do with the bill and is simply an
attempt to block protections for the
Atlantic and the Pacific coasts, and it
is based upon a false concern for
women and minorities’ jobs.
We know that Members from both
sides of the aisle understand that our
existing coastal economies are incom-
patible with more offshore oil and gas
development. I believe that enacting
this underlying bill and protecting the
Atlantic and Pacific coast from the
dangers of offshore drilling will, in
itself, safeguard jobs in the coastal
tourism and recreational industries,
many of which are held by women and
people of color.
b 1430
For example, thriving fish stocks and
healthy marine mammals off the
coasts of Oregon, New Jersey, Mary-
land, and Florida support tackle shops,
whale watching tours, and seafood
markets.
Oil-free beaches and bays in Virginia
and the Carolinas drive business for
local restaurants, vacation rentals, and
outfitters.
People from all walks of life, from di-
verse backgrounds, and from both po-
litical parties cherish these special
places and rely on healthy oceans,
clean beaches, and the abundant fish
and wildlife that come with it.
For example, last week, the Business
Alliance for Protecting the Pacific
Coast wrote to this body and expressed
its strong support for the underlying
bill. According to the business coali-
tion, which represents more than 4,000
businesses along the West Coast, off-
shore drilling threatens nearly 746,000
jobs and nearly $53 billion in GDP.
The real threat to jobs and economic
opportunities in coastal communities
would be failing to protect perma-
nently our shorelines from dangerous
oil drilling.
This is an unserious amendment that
does nothing to protect jobs belonging
to women and minorities, and it keeps
the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts at risk.
Mr. Chair, for these reasons, I urge
opposition to the amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I thought I
heard that this has nothing to do with
the bill. If that is the case, I take um-
brage with that, and maybe we ought
to take it up with the Parliamentarian.
The majority actually put this in
order, so I think it does pertain to this
bill.
I also heard that we can’t have our
cake and eat it too, that it is all about
visitation and enjoying the outdoors.
How does that work for Colorado? How
does that work for Wyoming? How does
that work for Arizona? We actually
have our cake and can eat it too.
Once again, I remind everybody that
these are the property of the American
people, not of individual States.
I get it. You are closest to this, so
you are implicated in some way or
form. But I also want to remind you
that, particularly in the Pacific, nat-
ural slicks of oil exist naturally. It is
something that nature actually takes
care of. With that aspect, it is very im-
portant.
The power of a job is very, very im-
portant. It empowers people. It doesn’t
victimize them. It is very important
that we are astute as to where we are
putting people to work.
By the way, if we don’t have good
jobs, how can we travel to go visit
these wonderful sites, enjoy a boat ride
going out and fishing in those areas?
When you start to look at some of
our plentiful playgrounds of these
areas, look no further than Alaska, one
of the most plentiful, bountiful areas
for fish and wildlife. People come from

around the world to see that, yet they

Once again, I want to make sure that
people are empowered with these good-
paying jobs, particularly those of mi-
nority, those of gender. These are im-
portant applications that facilitate up-
ward mobility of people.
This is a very timely amendment,
something that is vastly overdue. We
need to consider the consequences
when we do actions that are consequen-
tial.
Mr. Chair, this is a very timely
amendment. I ask everybody to vote
for this amendment.

Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of the bill, insert the following:
SEC. 5. ECONOMIC IMPACT STUDY.
Not later than 1 year after the date of en-
actment of this Act, the Secretary of Com-
merce shall conduct a study to determine
the potential economic impact of offshore
drilling on tourism, commercial fishing, rec-
reational fishing, boating, transportation,
and other waterfront-related and coastal-re-
lated business.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 548, the gentleman
from California (Mr. ROUDA) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Chair, this amend-
ment adds a provision to the bill that
would require the Department of Com-
merce to complete an economic impact
study of potential damage related to
offshore drilling. This assessment
would include tourism, commercial and
recreational fishing, boating, transpor-
tation, and other waterfront and coast-
al-related businesses.
The 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill,
which was once the largest oil spill in
United States waters and now ranks
third after Deepwater Horizon and the
1989 Exxon Valdez spills, killed thou-
sands of birds and marine animals.
Commercial fishing was suspended, and
tourism plunged.
California’s economic drivers are
concentrated along California’s coast-
line, and an oil spill from a Federal
platform, pipeline, or barge trans-
porting oil would have a catastrophic
impact on California’s and the Nation’s
economy and natural resources. In
fact, 40 percent of all goods shipped
into the United States come through
the Long Beach and Los Angeles ports
of entry, and these goods go to all 435
districts across the United States.
Every community would be impacted.
Offshore drilling for oil and gas
threatens key economic drivers in
coastal districts and States. Disasters
on the scale of the 2010 Deepwater Ho-
rizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico,
one of the largest environmental disas-
ters in American history, cost our
country more than $60 billion in eco-
nomic damages and environmental
damages beyond calculation.
Let’s not lose sight that even a small
spill has the potential to devastate im-
portant marine and coastal resources
and the communities and businesses
that depend on them.
California is home to more than 800
miles of coastline, and its coastal
economies annually generate hundreds
of billions of dollars in wages nation-
ally and nearly $2 trillion in GDP. A
disaster could put at risk nearly 746,000
West Coast jobs and $53 billion of GDP
that rely on healthy ocean ecosystems
and a clean marine environment.
Mr. Chair, I thank Representative
CUNNINGHAM for his leadership on this
important issue and the efforts to pro-
tect our coasts from new oil and gas
leasing. I urge my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle to support my amend-
ment and the passage of this critical
piece of legislation.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I
claim time in opposition to the amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Utah is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair,
clearly, the best thing that can be said
about this amendment is it is the last
one of this particular bill, and we can
move on.
The negative part that I have to say
about this amendment is the same
thing I said about the other amend-
ments. It is a study that is halfway
there; it is not comprehensive; it
doesn’t cover all elements that should
be studied; and in fact, it will produce
a skewed result because of what nar-
rowly comes within it.
There should be a study that says
what jobs will or will not happen from
this. That would be a study. That
would be a portion of it that would be
worth it. But it is not covered in what
we are attempting to do here.
In fact, if you think about it, this is
kind of a bizarre approach to things.
We already have a base bill to be
passed that will ban this activity, and
then we are going to institute a whole
bunch of studies to see if we should
have done the base bill in the first
place. This is totally backward in the
way bills should be done.
If the gentleman really believed in
the study and wanted to get the data,
for heaven’s sake, do that before intro-
ducing a bill that bans the activity in
the first place.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Chair, I appreciate
my colleague’s comments, but I do
want to point out the purpose of this is
simply to make sure that if we are
going to entertain offshore leases, we
fully understand the economic impact
in the event of a potential disaster oc-
curring. That seems to be a reasonable
obligation of Members of Congress to
taxpayers of America and working fam-
ilies across America, to make sure that
we protect them against future envi-
ronmental disasters.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, once
again, same thing: It is superfluous.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. ROUDA).
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I move
that the Committee do now rise.
The motion was agreed to.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms. CAS-
TOR of Florida) having assumed the

Shelf Lands Act to prohibit the Sec-
retary of the Interior including in any
leasing program certain planning
areas, and for other purposes, had come

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7623
September 11, 2019
House on the state of the Union for the
consideration of the bill (H.R. 205) to
amend the Gulf of Mexico Energy Secu-
rity Act of 2006 to permanently extend
the moratorium on leasing in certain
areas of the Gulf of Mexico, with Mr.
LAWSON of Florida in the chair.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the
bill is considered read the first time.
General debate shall not exceed 1
hour equally divided and controlled by
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Natural Re-
sources.
The gentleman from Arizona (Mr.
GRIJALVA) and the gentleman from
Utah (Mr. BISHOP) each will control 30
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman

Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chairman, H.R. 205, the Pro-
tecting and Securing Florida’s Coast-
line Act, would permanently protect
the eastern Gulf of Mexico from oil and
gas drilling.
Nearly all of the eastern Gulf re-
mains protected under a leasing mora-
torium until 2022 under the Gulf of
Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006.
This bill would permanently extend
that moratorium and, in doing so,
would safeguard Florida’s marine re-
sources, environment, and coastal
tourism economy.
Some of Florida’s more valuable as-
sets are tied to its beaches and its
coastal ecosystems. These drive a tour-
ism economy in Florida that brings in
billions of dollars each year and sup-
ports over 1.4 million jobs.
Over 2,000 Florida businesses, includ-
ing restaurants, hotels, and outfitters,
have expressed their strong support for
permanently protecting the eastern
Gulf because they know firsthand the
economic consequences of an offshore
oil spill.
Following the 2010 Deepwater Hori-
zon disaster, Florida suffered a $7.6 bil-
lion loss in tourism revenue, and book-
ings for hotels and for-hire fishing trips
dropped significantly. Even for places
that were left unscathed, the percep-
tion of oil-covered shores was enough
to redirect vacationing tourists to
other coastal States. That is why vot-
ers in the Sunshine State, Democrats
and Republicans alike, have made clear
time and time again that offshore drill-
ing has no place near Florida’s shores.
The eastern Gulf of Mexico also has
incredible value as a military test and
training range, and enactment of H.R.
205 is critical for America’s national
security and military preparedness.
In 2015, the Department of Defense
determined that offshore oil and gas in
the eastern Gulf of Mexico would jeop-
ardize the ability of the military to
conduct operations in the region.
Even the Trump administration,
which bends over backwards to support
the oil and gas industry, understands
how deeply unpopular offshore drilling
is in Florida and has manipulated the
offshore leasing process for political
reasons.
Five days after proposing to offer all
of America’s oceans to oil and gas com-
panies, former Interior Secretary Ryan
Zinke rushed down to Tallahassee to
meet with then-Florida Governor RICK
SCOTT. Understanding that Governor
Scott was facing a tough Senate race
but could never oppose anything from
the Trump administration, Secretary
Zinke tweeted that he was ‘‘removing
Florida from the draft offshore plan’’
at the Governor’s behest.
However, Secretary Zinke was con-
tradicted less than 2 weeks later when
a top Interior Department official stat-
ed that Florida was, in fact, still under
consideration for offshore leasing.
Then, at one of our hearings in the
Natural Resources Committee, Sec-
retary Zinke seemed to say that Flor-
ida was both safe yet still being consid-
ered.
The problem for Secretary Zinke was
that the oil and gas industry really
wants to drill in the eastern Gulf, and
this administration wants to do what-
ever this industry wants. But the peo-
ple of Florida do not want the industry
near their shores, and this administra-
tion needs Florida to vote for it next
year.
So now the administration has
paused the new leasing program be-
cause they can’t show their true inten-
tions before the next election. With a
wink and a nod towards industry, the
administration has paused their plans
for new leasing. But it is only a sham
disguised to convince Florida that it is
safe, while also making it clear to the
industry that, if they get a second
term, the eastern Gulf will be open for
drilling.
In May, I wrote to Interior Secretary
Bernhardt requesting a copy of the
leasing program as it currently exists
so we could settle the debate over
whether Florida was in or out.
Unsurprisingly, Secretary Bernhardt
has failed to turn over that plan.
The fact is that Florida’s beaches
will not be safe from the threat of off-
shore drilling until we have passed the
two bills we are debating today: this
one to protect Florida’s Gulf Coast and
H.R. 1941 to protect Florida’s Atlantic
Coast.
Florida voters should not have to
worry over the next 16 months whether
drilling rigs will one day appear on the
horizon. H.R. 205 provides Florida’s
Gulf Coast permanent protection from
offshore oil drilling and deserves this
body’s full support.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chairman, we have three bills in
this package of supposed Democrat en-
ergy. This is different than the other
time.
In the last bill we were talking about
here on the floor—at least the five peo-
ple who actually were here on the floor
to talk about it—that was an ideolog-
ical approach. This is different. This
deals with the military. This deals
with military issues on water that is
legitimately put off limits for its mili-
tary purpose.
There are military bases of signifi-
cance in Florida, specifically Eglin.
There is a military test and training
range on the waters in Florida. They
are significant, they are important,
and, indeed, they need to be preserved
for our military.
If, indeed, the military has an area
that is essential to military prepared-
ness and readiness, we should be cog-
nizant of that. There is no problem
with that. The problem was in this
military line, it was simply arbitrarily
drawn.
You take the latitude and the lon-
gitude and you just go down the line,
which means the line, itself, is bizarre
and arbitrary. The line, itself, is actu-
ally closer to New Orleans than it is to
Florida. The line, itself, has a greater
impact on the economies of Alabama,
Mississippi, and Louisiana than it does
in Florida.
What we should have done, were we
wise in this process, is to try to seek
some kind of variance to make sure
that the science was actually used and
that we don’t just take a ruler and
draw a straight line on some map. Al-
ready in the areas that are west of this
line—the other things that are already
open for oil and gas exploration—there
is cooperation between the Interior De-
partment and the Department of De-
fense in how you do it.
Thirty-six percent of all the drilling
that is done in the rest of the Gulf is
already under some kind of stipulation
with the Department of Defense. In
fact, there is a memo of understanding
between the Department of Defense
and the Department of the Interior
that has been there since 1983 which
mandates they cooperate and they con-
sult and they work through these
things in an appropriate way.
Were something like that to be part
of this bill, I know I could support it.
And to everyone else who is on the
floor, I would argue to do the same
thing. The sad part is this bill doesn’t
do that. Instead, it simply locks up the
issue on the one line that happens to be
there.
Now, here is where I don’t blame any-
one seated on the floor, the six of us
who actually are here. I do blame the
Rules Committee.
The Rules Committee made a very
bad rule and abused some of the powers
that the Rules Committee has to deal
with it. Not only did they make several
amendments self-executing—and, I am
sorry. I was on the Rules Committee
for a long time. I thought when we did
that, that was lousy policy. But it was
also lousy policy in this rule to make
some of the amendments self-exe-
cuting.

But then they forgot other amend-
ments that could have brought some-
thing into conclusion so that we could
simply say, if there is a military rea-
son, then, yes, and allow the military
to make that decision. That would
have been something I would have
bought, and I would have been happy to
support this particular bill.
But instead, the Rules Committee in-
sisted that there be miscellaneous
amendments that have nothing to do
brought up here and that have nothing
to do to try to bring some kind of co-
operation together.
So we are now faced with a bill that
will be done on an arbitrary standard
without study. It will be done on an ar-
bitrary line without science being
given to it. It will be an arbitrary line
that will simply call everything out
simply because somebody drew a line
on a map without thinking about it.
It did not have to be that way. That
is the sad part about this particular
bill.
I respect the sponsor of this par-
ticular bill. I respect what he is trying
to do. I agree with most of what he is
trying to do. But this could have been
a much better bill. This could have
been a bill that I could support and I
think most other people could support
and we could move forward, that would
have a much better option and chance
of actual passage in the Senate as well
as passage by a President who would
sign it, rather than actually putting
forth an SAP which indicates that he
would be advised to veto it. That did
not have to happen.
The reason it is not happening in a
better way is simply because the Rules
Committee refused some of the options
that were in front of them, and they
should have done it. They could have
done it, and it would be a much better
situation than what they had done.
So, in this situation, because we now
have a bill which, once again, takes
science and throws it into the trash
can like the other bill did and like the
next one tomorrow will do, I have a bill
here which I have to oppose, and it did
not have to be that way in the long
run.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. ROONEY), the original
sponsor of the legislation.
Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chair-
man, I thank the chairman for yield-
ing.
Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of
H.R. 205, the Protecting and Securing
Florida’s Coastline Act, which makes
the existing moratorium in the eastern
Gulf of Mexico permanent.
Mr. Chairman, I thank Representa-
tive CASTOR, our colead, for coleading
this effort with me and our bipartisan
Florida delegation for their support.
I have talked repeatedly about the
existential threat offshore drilling
poses to us on the west coast of Flor-
ida. It jeopardizes our tourist and rec-
reational economy.
Last year, 70 percent of Floridians
voted to ban offshore drilling because
tourism accounts for $37.4 billion of
GDP, including $17.5 billion right there
on the Gulf Coast, and supports over
600,000 jobs.
Following the Deepwater Horizon dis-
aster, the west coast of Florida faced
lost economic value for commercial
and recreational fishing and many can-
celed tourist trips, despite the fact
that there was no impact to our coast-
line. Perception became reality.
A 2018 study by the Gulf Restoration
Network describes the continual spills
in the Gulf. The Taylor Energy leak,
for example, has released approxi-
mately 1 million gallons of oil over the
last 14 years. Even Shell, which is a
good operator, had a spill from a jump-
er pipeline in 2016 that dumped 1,900
barrels of oil into the Gulf. The fol-
lowing year, LLOG had a similar leak
that dumped as much as 9,350 barrels
into the Gulf.
As long as humans and complex pipe-
line and well bore connections are in-
volved, there will be significant envi-
ronmental risk. These undersea con-
nections are difficult to maintain and
examine.
Additionally, as documented in a
study by the Pew Research Center,
large quantities of bentonite and other
chemicals are released in the water
while drilling.
My colleagues have raised concerns
about energy security and energy inde-
pendence. That is an important thing.
As this export-import chart shows, we
are energy independent and have be-
come net energy exporters. It was radi-
cally different. Ten years ago, these big
lines were coming that way, now they
are coming that way.
The exploitation of shale deposits via
horizontal drilling coupled with hy-
draulic fracking has revolutionized the
energy industry. Once again, our Amer-
ican free enterprise system has brought
competitive innovation to energy to
change the game.
In the Permian Basin of west Texas,
for example, there are three shale
zones. One of them, the Wolfcamp, is
said to contain 20 billion barrels of oil
and natural gas liquids—yes, billion.
We have more reserves in the United
States now than Russia or Saudi Ara-
bia have in conventional reserves. A
radical shift in the import and export
flows of oil and gas has taken place due
to American innovation.
In addition to the compelling eco-
nomic case for making the moratorium
in the eastern Gulf permanent, the
eastern Gulf is the home of the Gulf
Test Range, a 120,000-square-mile range
that stretches from the Florida Pan-
handle to the Keys. This unimpeded
training and testing area is a crucial
national security asset. It cannot be
replicated anywhere else in the United
States—or possibly the world. Its large
scale supports testing of hypersonic
weapons, combat maneuvers, drone
testing, and evolving weapons tech-
nology that need space for testing and
restrictions for classified work.
In May 2018, the DOD published a re-
port, ‘‘Preserving Military Readiness
in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico.’’ This
report examines the ongoing oper-
ations of the Gulf Test Range, its in-
ability to coexist with oil and gas oper-
ations, and its projected usage of the
range.
b 1500
What this chart shows here is that
the projected use of the range—here is
the line right here, south of Eglin Air
Force Base. Alabama is way over here.
It is not Alabama. It is Destin, Florida.
It shows that the most intensive pro-
jected use in the foreseeable future for
this testing range is right out here,
smack dab next to the military mission
line. We can’t let this thing move an
inch east.
This is why we need to ban drilling
east of the line. In 2006, this morato-
rium was enacted by a bipartisan Con-
gress, President George W. Bush, and
aided and abetted by Governor Jeb
Bush, and I might say, Bill Nelson and
Mel Martinez teamed up on this.
As we look forward to extending this
moratorium now, we are a unified team
in the Florida House delegation, work-
ing with Senator RUBIO and Governor
DeSantis. We have been doing that for
some time on a combined strategy.
All of them agree that we must pro-
tect this national security asset in
Florida’s coastline. As we move for-
ward, we will work together to con-
vince President Trump of the critical
importance of this moratorium to Flor-
ida.
Speaker PELOSI, Majority Leader
HOYER, and Natural Resources Com-
mittee Chairman GRIJALVA have all
stepped up and committed to protect
Florida. Now we need the Senate and
the administration to do the same
thing.
Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN).
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in
strong opposition to H.R. 205, which is
hostile to U.S. energy production and
unnecessarily takes domestic resources
off the table.
This legislation overly restricts off-
shore exploration and development,
which would eliminate opportunities to
create jobs, grow the economy, and in-
crease U.S. energy development to
lower prices for consumers.
In fiscal year 2018, offshore oil and
gas development generated over $3 bil-
lion for the United States Treasury,
and over $200 million for the Gulf
States. So why would we move bills
like this that would stop all the
progress that we have made in the
American energy renaissance?
Members of Congress who support
bills like this, they still like to drive
their cars. They still like to fly in air-
planes. They like that 24/7, 365 baseload
power supply that heats and cools their
homes, provides the electricity for

their cold drinks, and provides the
power for the manufacturing processes
when they are in their district.
Admiral Mike Mullen said that there
is no national security without energy
security. I firmly believe in that. We
are going to weaken our national secu-
rity by taking areas off the table for
exploration and production. What that
means is, we are going to be more reli-
ant on foreign sources of energy.
I talked about New England States
receiving LNG ships from Russia to
provide natural gas, which we have an
abundance of here in this country, but
New England States are getting nat-
ural gas from Russia. I find that horrid
and abysmal when we have the re-
sources in this country to provide the
energy to meet our needs.
Instead of focusing on anti-energy
bills like H.R. 205, we should be pur-
suing policies that encourage safe, reli-
able, and affordable energy to the
American people through free-market
solutions.
We are in an American energy renais-
sance thanks to President Trump and
Republicans’ progrowth policies, and
anti-offshore bills like H.R. 205 hamper
these hard-earned gains. Taking do-
mestic energy production off the table
would mean one thing—I reiterate—re-
liance on foreign energy, and that is
wrong when we have the resources here
in this country.
We should explore. We should find.
We should develop. We should produce.
We should benefit from those produc-
tions. And we should benefit from the
royalties that come back to the States
and the United States Treasury. To
fund things like the Land and Water
Conservation Fund that sets land aside
for posterity funded through royalties
through oil and gas production off-
shore. How are you going to fund the
Land and Water Conservation Fund if
you take those royalties off the table?
I tell America, what they are going
to do is raise taxes on you because they
like the conservation policies. They
are going to fund it with raising taxes.
Royalties provide that funding for con-
servation. I strongly urge my col-
leagues to defeat this bill.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair-
woman, I yield such time as she may
consume to the gentlewoman from
Florida (Ms. CASTOR), an original co-
sponsor—along with Mr. ROONEY—of
this legislation before us, H.R. 205.
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam
Chairwoman, I want to thank Chair-
man GRIJALVA for being a champion for
America’s natural resources. In doing
so, the gentleman is a champion for
jobs and the economy.
We know this in Florida. That is why
I rise in strong support of H.R. 205, Pro-
tecting and Securing Florida’s Coast-
line Act of 2019.
It is a pleasure to be here on the floor
with my Republican colleague, FRANCIS
ROONEY. He is passionate about pro-
tecting the State of Florida because
our way of life is at risk when you put
oil rigs off of our beaches.
It threatens our way of life. And the
gentleman understands very well, as a
successful businessman, that when you
threaten our way of life, and you
threaten our natural environment and
our beaches, you are threatening our
economy and jobs.
Even though it was 9 years ago, the
BP Deepwater Horizon disaster is still
fresh in my mind, and it is fresh in the
minds of my neighbors who live all
across the Gulf Coast. It was dev-
astating.
April 20, 2010. You all probably re-
member because CNN had the video
from the oil well that continued to
spew oil into the Gulf of Mexico
through May, through all of June, all
of July, August, and they didn’t cap
the well until late in September.
It wreaked havoc not just on Flor-
ida’s economy and not just on our
beautiful environment, but on people’s
lives. I remember very well holding a
woman in my arms who was a small
business owner from the Clearwater
area. The oil didn’t even wash up on
the shores of Tampa Bay or the beau-
tiful Pinellas coast beaches, or down to
Sanibel Island, but the economy took a
hit. They lost everything they had.
It wiped out mom-and-pop busi-
nesses, restaurants, hotels, and every-
one that relies on clean water and
clean beaches for their livelihood.
Fishermen couldn’t fish. It was a catas-
trophe. Gulf seafood was off the menu.
That meant people weren’t coming to
the mom-and-pop restaurants for their
meals.
In addition to all of that, whether it
was deformed fish and species, there
was permanent damage to the eco-
system. Researchers that I work with
at the University of South Florida say
that even today on the floor of the Gulf
of Mexico in the trench off of the beau-
tiful Florida Panhandle, there is still a
layer of what they call dirty snow.
Because if you remember, they had
to pour dispersants and chemicals onto
the area of the blowout to make sure
that the oil dispersed.
Well, that didn’t just disappear. It
ended up in the food chain and in the
entire ecosystem, and it is still out
there today, impacting the food web
and everything we love about the State
of Florida.
In fact, the University of South Flor-
ida’s College of Marine Science has
done a lot of research on this. They did
12 separate voyages over 7 years on the
USF Research Vessel Weatherbird II.
They say, interestingly, the areas
where you have oil rigs, they have de-
termined that fish species in that area
of the Gulf are gone. There is lack of
diversity there.
The entire food web is impacted. This
is going to impact us for decades to
come, and there is no way to make it
up. The deep sea is not recovering. In
fact, clearly visible abnormalities have
been chronicled just recently.
The environmental impact is right in
front of us; the economic impact, as
well as the impact on small business
owners. The U.S. Travel Association
estimates that we lost $22 billion due
to the BP disaster.
Our bill will ensure that that never
happens again because it says perma-
nently. That moratorium that had a bi-
partisan vote that Congress took in
2006 which said that until 2022, you
can’t drill in that part of the Eastern
Gulf of Mexico, this bill will extend
that permanently because this is a dan-
gerous, dirty business.
Florida, over time, has chosen not to
industrialize its coastline. Our econ-
omy is based on clean beaches and
clean water. And Floridians have spo-
ken, by the way. Last November, there
was a constitutional amendment on
the ballot that said we are going to ban
offshore oil drilling in State waters. It
often is just a few miles off the coast.
It passed by 69 percent.
I wish the Trump administration
would listen. But when you install an
oil lobbyist as the head of the Interior
Department, I guess we know that Big
Oil is calling the shots. We are going to
say no today. We are going to say, the
people of Florida—in a bipartisan way
with a united Florida delegation—we
are going to say no. It is not needed. It
is not wanted, and it is not the future.
It is not needed because America is
already an exporter of oil and gas. We
don’t need to expand into areas that
are too precious to drill. It is not want-
ed. It is not welcome.
Even the Department of Defense has
said that this is an important military
testing area off of the bases in the pan-
handle. They have already weighed in
to say: Don’t bring the oil rigs into this
military testing zone. It is too special
to drill.
Today, once again, a united Florida
delegation is asking Congress to con-
tinue to recognize this part of Florida
as a special place, and to continue the
moratorium permanently. Floridians
and folks all over the country that
come to our beautiful State to vaca-
tion, they know. It is not wanted. It is
not needed.
Our future is clean energy. That is
what we should be investing in. That is
what we should be debating and spend-
ing time here today on. That is the fu-
ture of the United States of America.
That is where the jobs of the future are
going to come from. Jobs in solar and
wind energy are already far surpassing
jobs in fossil fuels.
The climate crisis requires that
America be smarter, and we don’t dou-
ble down on the dirty policies of the
past—dirty oil drilling.
For all of those reasons, let’s dem-
onstrate it here today and push back
on the Trump administration’s at-
tempt to open up the Gulf beaches to
oil drilling. Let’s say no. We have got
a bipartisan Florida delegation that is
standing up, united, and I want to
thank all of my colleagues from Flor-
ida for their leadership year in and
year out on this issue.
Let’s send a strong vote today. Let’s

H7626 September 11, 2019
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Chair-
woman, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON).
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam
Chairwoman, I thank the gentleman
from Utah for yielding.
I rise in opposition to this bill and
my colleagues’ efforts to impede the
rapid growth of American energy ex-
ploration. This bill is flawed in a num-
ber of ways, as we have recounted here
already during this debate.
First and foremost, it is clear that
banning energy exploration will in-
crease the prices that families pay at
the pump and the prices they pay to
power their homes.
Unfortunately, the tax on our Na-
tion’s energy producers aren’t new. We
know what happens when government
intervenes by imposing burdensome
regulations and senseless moratoriums
like we are seeing today.
For years, New England States have
pushed restrictive energy policies, and
what we are considering here on the
floor is no exception.
A handful of Governors and State
legislatures are narrowly focused on
hindering the exploration and develop-
ment of critical energy resources. What
those policies have resulted in are in-
creased prices for consumers, and they
have done nothing to reduce demands
for fossil fuels.
In fact, as Congressman DUNCAN re-
counted just a few moments ago, last
year, those policies culminated in a
Russian tanker delivering natural gas
to the Boston Harbor. Why? Because
there weren’t enough pipelines avail-
able to bring it from nearby Pennsyl-
vania. You heard it right.
Despite being just a few hundred
miles from the Marcellus Shale, one of
the largest natural gas reserves in the
country, our New England States were
forced to import natural gas from
Vladimir Putin. Nobody on this floor—
the advocates of this bill—seem to have
a problem with that.
Now my colleagues want to imple-
ment these policies on a Federal level
with moratoriums on drilling. The
event in Boston shows us that the leg-
islation before us would have no im-
pact on reducing demand for fossil
fuels. We would simply have to import
more from our adversaries. That is not
good policy.
b 1515
As has been explained, to add to the
madness, the bill is completely irrecon-
cilable with the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund, one of the biggest pri-
orities of the Natural Resources Com-
mittee in this Congress.
The LWCF receives its funding from
oil revenues generated off the coast of
States like Louisiana, my home State.
On the very same day that the Natural
Resources Committee marked up these
bills to ban offshore oil and gas explo-
ration, the committee marked up an-
other bill to permanently fund the
LWCF. The majority wants to see man-
datory spending of $900 million per
year out of the LWCF, but at the same
time, it wants to eliminate completely
its funding source. That is just simply
nonsense.
Our country is blessed with an abun-
dance of natural resources. We have
the right to use those God-given re-
sources to create jobs, foster economic
growth, and pave the way to an era of
American energy dominance. Oppres-
sive policies like the ones before us
today have been our own worst enemy,
forcing us to rely on hostile, foreign
nations to meet our energy demands.
We simply can’t do that any longer.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. GAETZ).
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Chair, if drilling off Florida
is the only thing that is going to keep
us from having high energy prices and
a reliance on foreign energy, I don’t
know why that hasn’t happened yet.
Right now, we are not drilling off the
coast of Florida, and we are energy
dominant in the world. We are not
drilling off the coast of Florida, and we
continue to see energy prices dropping.
As my colleague Representative CAS-
TOR said, 69 percent of Floridians do
not want to see drilling off our shores.
Madam Chair, if you would like to drill
off the coast of Louisiana or South
Carolina, I would say have at it, but
leave my beloved Florida alone.
There are many reasons to oppose
drilling off Florida’s shores: our envi-
ronment, our tourism economy, and
our real property values. But I come to
the floor today to plead the case for
northwest Florida’s military mission.
The Gulf of Mexico test range is one
of the only places in the world where
we launch live-fire over water and land
it on land. I cannot believe that I have
to come here to make the argument
that it is an incredibly stupid idea to
launch experimental missiles over ac-
tive oil rigs. That would seem to be ob-
vious to most people. I know it is obvi-
ous to many in my district.
This military mission is what keeps
us safe. It is ludicrous to suggest that
we have more to fear from LNG from
Russia than we have from a China that
continues to close the technological
capability edge with our country. The
Gulf test range is one of the places
where we will be testing hypersonic
and supersonic weapons. If we do not
continue to maintain that advantage,
everybody had better brush up on their
Mandarin because we won’t be able to
protect our country, and that is the far
more significant venture.
In Florida, we will protect our envi-
ronment from the Congress. Please
don’t do anything to harm us.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Chair, I
appreciate the last gentleman’s state-
ments. He may remember he still has
the land range in Utah to use.
Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to
the gentleman from California (Mr.
MCCLINTOCK).
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Chair, I
respect the bill’s author, and I under-
stand that he is faithfully representing
the opinions of the majority of his dis-
trict in seeking to permanently place
our offshore petroleum reserves off the
coast of his State off-limits to explo-
ration and development.
All of our Nation’s coastlines are
beautiful, and they all support all sorts
of tourism, commercial activities, and
military activities important to their
local communities and our Nation. For
more than a century, offshore energy
development has shown itself to be en-
tirely compatible with these uses. To
suggest that it is in some places but
not in others is manifestly silly and
wrong.
For 22 years in the California Legis-
lature, I represented California’s Chan-
nel Islands, including the Santa Bar-
bara Channel, which, by the way, is the
home of the Pacific missile test range.
Yes, in 1969, an outdated drilling
technology produced the third-largest
oil spill ever recorded, devastating
tourism and fishing that year. I fully
understand the fears of the supporters
of this bill. But a little perspective is
needed.
The economic losses caused by the
spill were fully compensated, and the
environmental damage was quickly
healed. I might add that the second-
largest oil spill in history was the
wreck of the oil tanker Exxon Valdez,
which is the alternative to offshore
production.
For more than 50 years, offshore pro-
duction in the Channel Islands has
been an immense positive for the re-
gion and is entirely compatible with
military operations there. It has sup-
ported thousands of jobs; it has pumped
a fortune into the local economy; and
it has generated enormous revenues for
local, State, and Federal coffers.
By the way, if you ask any sports
fisherman in the region where the best
fishing is, he will tell you that it is by
the rigs.
I am not here today to argue for what
is right for local communities in other
States and other regions. I understand
that offshore production suffers from
what Bastiat called the paradox of the
seen and unseen. We see the danger of
a blowout like Santa Barbara in 1969 or
the Deepwater Horizon in 2010. But
what we don’t see are the enormous
economic benefits generated day in and
day out by American energy produc-
tion or the critical role it plays in our
Nation’s prosperity.
This is where the national interest
must be put ahead of parochial ‘‘not in
my backyard’’ protests. Procedures
have been long established to ensure
that offshore production can occur
alongside commercial fishing, recre-
ation, and, yes, military testing and
training. They have proven themselves
to be entirely compatible during many
decades of practical experience.
Indeed, one of the many ironies of
this NIMBY movement is that commer-
cial fishing and military operations are

highly dependent on precisely the
abundant and affordable petroleum
produced by offshore drilling, so too,
by the way, is the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund.
Offshore production is the main fund-
ing source for this program, and an-
other shortsighted irony is that the
same markup that produced this bill to
shut down offshore production off the
Florida coast also permanently reau-
thorized the very fund that depends on
offshore production for its very exist-
ence.
If the Congress were to enact a per-
manent moratorium on production for
one part of our coastline, it begs the
question: Why are some people more
equal than others?
Madam Chair, we are all advocates
for our local districts, and the bill’s au-
thor is an able and respected advocate
for his. But our collective responsi-
bility as Congress is not to local inter-
ests but to the national interest, and it
is in the national interest that our Na-
tion is energy independent, prosperous,
and strong. This bill undermines these
vital national objectives.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
For the record, this bill will not af-
fect LWCF funds at all. All the money
for the fund comes from existing oil
and gas activities in the central and
western Gulf of Mexico. The Land and
Water Conservation Fund is credited
with the first $900 million in offshore
revenues. Last year, those revenues
were $4.7 billion, and projections are
that existing activity in the Gulf of
Mexico is enough to keep the fund
going for a long, long time.
We don’t need to drill in the Atlantic
or the Pacific or near Florida to find
more money. Revenues are not a prob-
lem. The real problem is that only
twice in the history of the fund has
Congress appropriated the full $900 mil-
lion that it should get. In fact, over
time, we have collected $37.8 billion of
revenue that should have been spent on
LWCF, but Congress has appropriated
less than half, $18.4 billion. Revenue is
not the issue.
This permanent protection for Flor-
ida coastal areas is not going to hurt
the fund. It has been stated three times
already by my friends on the other side
of the aisle, but that is completely
false.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Chair, I
include in the RECORD a Statement of
Administrative Policy on this par-
ticular bill.
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
H.R. 205—PROTECTING AND SECURING FLORIDA’S
COASTLINE ACT OF 2019—REP. ROONEY, R–FL,
AND 18 COSPONSORS
H.R. 1146—ARCTIC CULTURAL AND COASTAL
PLAIN PROTECTION ACT—REP. HUFFMAN, D–
CA, AND 182 COSPONSORS
H.R. 1941—COASTAL AND MARINE ECONOMIES
PROTECTION ACT—REP. CUNNINGHAM, D–SC,
AND 51 COSPONSORS
The Administration opposes H.R. 205, the
Protecting and Securing Florida’s Coastline
Act of 2019, H.R. 1146, the Arctic Cultural and
Coastal Plain Protection Act, and H.R. 1941,
the Coastal and Marine Economies Protec-
tion Act. These bills would undermine the
Administration’s commitment to a pros-
perous American economy supported by the
responsible use of the Nation’s abundant nat-
ural resources. Development of our resources
enhances our energy security and energy
dominance, and produces high-paying Amer-
ican jobs; provides increased revenue to the
Treasury, States, tribes, and local commu-
nities; and is a critical source of conserva-
tion funding.
H.R. 1146 would prohibit the Department of
the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management
from administering an oil and gas leasing
program in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska.
The bill would repeal a provision of the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that directed the
Secretary of the Interior to establish a pro-
gram for the development of the Coastal
Plain that would allow the use of no more
than about 0.01 percent of the total acreage
of ANWR for surface development of produc-
tion and support facilities. The Administra-
tion supports environmentally responsible
energy development in the Coastal Plain,
also known as the 1002 Area, of ANWR. Such
development is expected to increase Amer-
ica’s energy security and independence, cre-
ate jobs, and provide affordable, reliable en-
ergy for consumers while providing much-
needed revenue to both the State of Alaska
and the Federal Government.
Similarly, H.R. 205 and H.R. 1941 would
both restrict future oil and gas development
in the Federal waters of the U.S. Outer Con-
tinental Shelf (OCS). H.R. 205 would amend
the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act
(GOMESA) to make permanent the current
temporary leasing moratorium on offshore
leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, off the
west coast of Florida. H.R. 1941 would amend
the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act
(OCSLA) to permanently remove from con-
sideration acreage for offshore leasing on
both the Atlantic and Pacific OCS. Both of
these bills would undermine OCSLA, which
established a periodic, multi-stage planning
process involving State and tribal consulta-
tion and a thoughtful comparison and bal-
ancing of the benefits and impacts to all the
regions of the OCS. These bills would perma-
nently constrain this careful administrative
process. Under the bills, large swaths of the
OCS would be off limits for resource develop-
ment without the benefit of periodic assess-
ments of the potential economic, social, and
environmental effects of development, as re-
quired by existing law. Excluding these areas
from leasing consideration could place more
pressure for development on other OCS areas
and constrain our ability to meet national
energy needs as required by OCSLA.
Additionally, each of these bills would
eliminate the potential for future direct rev-
enue that would otherwise be provided to the
Treasury, and through revenue sharing, to
the States, tribes, and counties where the de-
velopment activities occur. In Fiscal Year
2018, energy development on Federal and In-
dian lands and waters generated approxi-
mately $9 billion in direct revenue from roy-
alties, bonus bids, and rents. Of that rev-
enue, $1.78 billion was disbursed to 35 States.
The top States receiving Fiscal Year 2018
revenues were New Mexico ($634.9 million);
Wyoming ($563.9 million); Colorado ($112.5
million); Louisiana ($91 million); and Utah
($76 million). Additionally, more than $1 bil-
lion was disbursed to Indian tribes and indi-
vidual Indian mineral owners; $1.22 billion to
the Reclamation Fund; $970 million to the
Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF);
$150 million to the Historic Preservation
Fund; and $3.5 billion to the general fund of
the Treasury.
Prohibiting energy development in new
Federal areas would hinder future adminis-
trations’ efforts to make up for revenue lost
as production declines from leases in aging
energy fields. Such restrictions will tie the
hands of future administrations and reduce
their ability to enhance energy security
through strong domestic energy production
and to ensure affordable energy for American
families.
If these bills were presented to the Presi-
dent, his advisors would recommend he veto
them.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Chair, I
include in the RECORD a letter in
strong opposition to the bill signed by
over 20 entities, including the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, the Consumer
Energy Alliance, and the Laborers’
International Union of North America,
and a letter in opposition from the La-
borers’ International Union of North
America.
SEPTEMBER 5, 2019.
U.S. CONGRESS,
Washington, DC.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: We rely on Amer-
ican made energy to power our daily lives,
communities and to grow a more prosperous
future. Americans deserve clean, safe, reli-
able, abundant and affordable energy so that
our families, communities and businesses
can all share the opportunities American en-
ergy creates. Our country cannot afford to
block access to new energy supplies and risk
losing our energy advantage. That’s why we
ask you to oppose legislation being consid-
ered by the U.S. House of Representatives
next week that would slow scientific surveys
and prevent access to new sources of Amer-
ican offshore energy in the Outer Conti-
nental Shelf.
For more than seven decades, energy devel-
opment in the Gulf of Mexico has worked
collaboratively alongside tourism, fishing
and Defense Department training activities.
But H.R. 205 would permanently extend the
eastern Gulf of Mexico moratorium on oil
and natural gas activities. The Congressional
Budget Office conservatively estimates that
this could cost taxpayers $400 million in rev-
enue over the next 10 years. Similarly, H.R.
1941 would block offshore energy develop-
ment in the Pacific and Atlantic planning
areas, and H.R. 1146 would lock up energy re-
sources in the Alaskan Coastal Plain.
Congress should support progress. Modern
energy technologies have enabled an impres-
sive record of environmental stewardship
and innovation. But when the government
chooses to arbitrarily and permanently close
off areas to exploration and potential devel-
opment, we simply increase our dependency
on foreign sources. This reality is visible in
places like California and Massachusetts.
Despite abundant offshore oil and natural
gas resources, California imports 57 percent
of its oil supply, a staggering 37 percent of
which comes from Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile,
to meet energy needs each winter, Massachu-
setts imports liquefied natural gas from Rus-
sia.
American energy is produced with a small-
er carbon footprint under significantly
stronger environmental protections than en-
ergy produced anywhere else in the world.
We ask you to embrace these homegrown op-
portunities that benefit American families,
create high-wage jobs, strengthen the U.S.
economy and protect our environment.
Next week, the House of Representatives is
expected to consider legislation undercut-
ting domestic energy security and economic

Hon. NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY,
Minority Leader, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: On behalf of the 500,000 mem-
bers of the Laborers’ International Union of
North America (LiUNA), I want to express
our opposition to H.R. 205, which would per-
manently extend the moratorium on oil and
gas leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico;
H.R. 1146, to once again prohibit oil and gas
drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Ref-
uge (ANWR); and, H.R. 1941, which would bar
offshore drilling along the Atlantic and Pa-
cific Coasts.
Once again, jobs of LiUNA members who
work in the energy sector are being targeted
for elimination by environmental radicals
for purely political purposes. There is abso-
lutely no chance for these ‘‘message bills’’ to
be enacted into law this Congress. So, in-
stead of working to enact real job creating
infrastructure legislation, union members
see their jobs once again being denigrated
and belittled.
Energy independence is central to the fu-
ture of the American economy and our
standard of living. Unfortunately, the en-
emies of job creation continue to try to wall
off and strand our domestic energy resources
from development; killing jobs, prolonging
our energy dependence on unfriendly foreign
regimes, and saddling middle-class and
lower-income families with rising energy
costs.
LiUNA members, in Alaska and elsewhere,
know first-hand that when done responsibly,
with union-trained workers, energy develop-
ment can coexist with environmental stew-
ardship. LiUNA and the other building
trades unions invest significant resources
into the training of our members that help
develop the knowledge and skills they need
to work safely and productively while con-
structing energy and other infrastructure to
the highest standards.
For the hard-working members of LiUNA
and other building trades unions, these jobs
put food on their families’ tables and roofs
over their heads. These jobs enable them to
put their children through college, to save
for retirement, and to spend money in busi-
ness establishments that employ others.
I urge you to vote against these ill-con-
ceived bills.
With kind regards, I am
Sincerely yours,
TERRU O’SULLIVAN,
General President.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Chair, I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Chair, I
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from
Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES).
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam
Chair, I thank the ranking member for
the recognition to talk about this leg-
islation.
Madam Chair, we are talking about
legislation that has to do with energy
policy and energy production. We are
talking about the goals here, as I heard
different speakers talk about pro-
tecting our fisheries and our environ-
ment. I heard speakers talk about pro-
tecting our military mission, those
military servicemembers and that
military edge and the technology we
have. I heard people talking about jobs
and the threat of spills.
Madam Chair, I support those objec-
tives, and I know that this may sound
counterintuitive: This bill undermines
the very objectives that it is purported
to advance. Let’s go through them.
Let’s go through those things.
Number one, talking about the envi-
ronment, that this bill will cause dam-
age to the environment and it will un-
dermine ecological productivity.
Madam Chair, if you take a look at
this graphic right here, you probably
think this is where energy infrastruc-
ture is. You probably think that is
what this is. This depicts the intensity
of energy infrastructure in the Gulf of
Mexico from the Texas coast to right
there in Alabama.
In reality, oh, my goodness, look at
that, if it is not red snapper landings.
This is actually where the fish are.
This shows the landings of where the
fish are. This actually increases eco-
logical productivity by creating habi-
tat for fisheries.
I heard a speaker on the other side
talk about how there was devastation
of fisheries in the State of Florida after
the spill, the disaster in 2010. In 2011,
the State of Florida had 117 million
pounds of fisheries. In 2011, that was
more than the fisheries they produced
in the most recent year recorded. Let
me say that again. In the immediate
aftermath of the spill, in 2011, there
were more fisheries landed worth more
money than there was in the most re-
cent year recorded, which is 2017.
I hate to sit here and continue to un-
dermine all these narratives, but let’s
go on.
We are saying that this bill is de-
signed to protect our environment. Ac-
tually, Madam Chair, you can look at
statistics, and as far as I understand,
they use cars and airplanes and have
air-conditioning in Florida. That re-
quires oil and gas. Since you are pro-
ducing it and need it, the safest way to
transport is to produce it domestically
and then put it in a pipeline. That is
not my statistic; it is from the Na-
tional Research Council.
Once again, Madam Chair, you are
not protecting habitat; you are actu-
ally preventing habitat from being es-
tablished. You are not helping ecologi-
cal productivity; you are undermining
it. You are not protecting the environ-
ment or preventing spills; you are pro-
viding a greater risk for that. My
friend from California (Mr. MCCLIN-
TOCK) made reference to the Valdez
spill. That was a boat.
Let’s go on to the other one, the
military. I heard a speaker say: Oh, we
can’t have energy production here be-
cause that is going to prevent our abil-
ity to fly and practice with weapons in
the Gulf of Mexico.
Madam Chair, when we go into war
and go up against adversaries, do we
say: Hey, we need you to take that
building down so my missile can shoot
straight in?
No. That is absurd. You operate
under real conditions, which includes,
in some cases, obstructions.
I want to make reference here that
we are talking about thousands and
thousands and thousands of square
miles. You can produce here with very,
very little surface infrastructure. Most
of it is subsea, having zero impact.
b 1530
Now, Madam Chair, I heard somebody
talking earlier about 2006 and how Con-
gress stepped in and provided a morato-
rium. Yes. But do you know what that
moratorium is provided in exchange
for? Moving the Military Mission Line
to the east.
There was an agreement. The 181
leasing areas, that was agreed to. We
actually added more production areas
in exchange for a temporary morato-
rium. But what is being proposed now
is a greater threat to the environment.
It is putting a moratorium in place,
and it is not doing any type of balance.
We can step in and protect our mili-
tary mission, we can protect our envi-
ronment, and we can have jobs and en-
ergy production in the United States.
The Acting CHAIR (Ms. WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ). The time of the gentleman
has expired.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Chair, I
yield an additional 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Louisiana.
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam
Chair, I also heard talk about the Land
and Conservation Water Fund and, yes,
the irony of the fact that there is legis-
lation that the chair pushed that per-
manently authorizes the Land and
Water Conservation Fund. Legislation
moving it permanently funds it at $900
million; $150 million a year goes to the
Historic Preservation Fund.
But in reality, the Land and Water
Conservation Fund is not limited to
$900 million. It is not. I have heard peo-
ple say it over and over again. That is
not accurate.
There is an additional 12.5 percent
that comes from revenue sharing that

also goes to the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund, putting it over $1 bil-
lion a year. Plus, you add $150 million
from the Historic Preservation Fund.
Plus, just to put it in perspective,
Madam Chair, when you add up just be-
tween 2011 and 2016, $55 billion—$55 bil-
lion—was generated for the U.S. Treas-
ury from energy production on Federal
lands and waters.
Madam Chair, that doesn’t just fund
the Land and Water Conservation Fund
and Historic Preservation Fund. That
funds our veterans’ benefits. It funds
environmental programs. It funds
healthcare for our elderly. It funds
early childhood education. It funds in-
frastructure.
This, according to the Government
Accountability Office, is one of the
largest nontaxed streams of revenue.
And we are talking about stopping it.
Production doesn’t go on in per-
petuity. You need additional layers. It
takes 10 years to go from leasing to
production, so we have got to start
planning now to produce safely to en-
sure we can continue to have a vibrant
economy, jobs, to continue having a
safe environment.
This bill undermines the very objec-
tives that it was purported to advance.
Madam Chair, I urge objection to this
uninformed legislation.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, as a
point of reference, the BP oil spill cost
the fishing industry at least, at the
minimum, $94.7 million and, at the
maximum, $1.6 billion in 2010. I men-
tion that because, you know, oil spills
are not necessarily good for fisheries in
the long haul.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Chair, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Arizona (Mr. GOSAR).
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentleman from Utah (Mr. BISHOP),
ranking member, for some time to
speak in opposition to this bill.
Madam Chair, like the previous legis-
lation, this bill represents a step back-
wards in ensuring American energy se-
curity, but making certain sections of
the eastern Gulf of Mexico perma-
nently off limits to oil and gas develop-
ment, this legislation once again ties
one hand behind our Nation’s back.
As chairman of the Congressional
Western Caucus and the ranking mem-
ber of the House Committee on Natural
Resources Subcommittee on Energy
and Mineral Resources, I have a unique
insight into many of America’s energy
issues.
Many on the Western Caucus and Re-
publican members on the Committee
on Natural Resources have a different
vision for America, a vision that
doesn’t pick winners and losers and in-
cludes a true all-of-the-above energy
strategy that embraces wind, solar, nu-
clear, hydropower, coal, oil, and nat-
ural gas. Our vision encourages innova-
tion and less burdensome mandates. We
know responsible energy production
and protecting our environment go
hand in hand.
The offshore coalition, a group of at
least 17 members, including the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and the Labor-
ers’ International Union of North
America, sent a letter opposing H.R.
205, H.R. 1941, and H.R. 1146. In the coa-
lition’s letter, they state: ‘‘For more
than seven decades, energy develop-
ment in the Gulf of Mexico has worked
collaboratively alongside tourism, fish-
ing, and Defense Department training
activities. But H.R. 205 would perma-
nently extend the eastern Gulf of Mex-
ico moratorium on oil and natural gas
activities.
‘‘We rely on American-made energy
to power our daily lives, communities,
and to grow a prosperous future. Amer-
icans deserve clean, safe, reliable,
abundant, and affordable energy so
that our families, communities, and
businesses can all share the opportuni-
ties American energy creates.
‘‘Our country cannot afford to block
access to new energy supplies and risk
losing our energy advantage. That’s
why we ask you to oppose legislation
being considered by the U.S. House of
Representatives this week that would
slow scientific surveys and prevent ac-
cess to new sources of American off-
shore energy in the Outer Continental
Shelf.’’
Our previous speaker actually al-
luded to this very aspect. It takes 10
years to go from inquiry to actual pro-
duction. I couldn’t agree more with the
sentiments expressed by this broad co-
alition, by previous Members here on
this side of the aisle that have opposed
it, and I urge Members to oppose H.R.
205.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Chair, I appreciate the debate
that we have had on this particular
bill—kind of.
Florida does have the right to do
whatever it wishes to do on its prop-
erty and on its State lands and State
waters, and they should have the right
to do it unless there is some kind of
impact to Louisiana, Texas, Alabama,
and Mississippi, in which case, them
doing something strictly for Florida’s
purposes that doesn’t take into ac-
count the other States is wrong-mind-
ed.
But for this particular bill, we are
really not talking about the economy
and the tourism and everything else.
This bill is about a military line and
military issues.
As I have stated earlier, yes, there
are military positions in Florida. There
is a military testing training range on
the water, which is not as good as the
land-based one but is on the water in
Florida.
Those are there and they deserve to
be protected, and when the military
wants those things set aside without
any kind of disturbance, that is logical.
That is limited. That is logical, and it
is something we should approve, which
is why this issue should not be a bill
before us. This bill should have been
decided as part of the NDAA.
But the question here is: Is every-
thing on this arbitrary line that was
drawn, is it all needed for military use?
It should be the military that makes
that decision; and, I am sorry, in the
past, they have simply said, no, they
don’t need it all.
So if we were wise, if we were really
doing the right thing for this country,
if we were really doing the right thing
on this issue, we would simply say the
military can exclude what the military
needs; and what they don’t need should
be allowed to be open for other kinds of
exploration that could benefit Mis-
sissippi and Alabama and New Orleans
and Texas, because they happen to be
closer to the line than Florida is. That
is the right thing to do.
We should not do an arbitrary rule
that just says to take the ruler and
make the damn line down the middle of
the map. That is wrong. That is a vio-
lation of everything that is logical.
That is a violation of everything that
is scientific that we are supposed to do.
That is a violation of even taking away
the ability of the military to make de-
cisions for themselves. That is why
this is a failed opportunity on our part.
Had the Rules Committee simply de-
cided to take more rules into effect, we
could have modified this bill to make
it something that almost everybody in
this room could have accepted. But the
Rules Committee refused to do that.
For whatever political purposes they
had in mind, they simply refused to do
that.
So, we have the option of instead of
doing a bill that is the right thing to
do and a good thing to do, we have a
bill that is going to be questionable
here. It is going to be questionable in
the Senate. It is going to be question-
able on the deck.
We could have done the right thing.
We should have done the right thing.
Hopefully, before this bill is all the
way through the system, we will do the
right thing. But for that, this is a
failed opportunity, and I do blame the
Rules Committee for refusing to try
and expand the discussion so we could
actually make a bill that is viable.
Madam Chair, I appreciate the oppor-
tunity and all those who have spoken
on this bill. I appreciate the gentleman
from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA), and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Chair, I thought I would close
by talking a little bit about, because it
relates to the discussion that we are
having today, protecting these very
valuable coastal areas in this country.
My Republican colleagues introduced
the American Energy First Act today,
and, frankly, it is quite frightening. It
is really the ‘‘Earth isn’t burning fast
enough’’ legislation, as I like to call it.
America is already the number one
producer of oil and gas in the world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7630 September 11, 2019
This administration is lifting protec-
tions on hundreds of millions of acres
of public lands for even more drilling.
Our Republican colleagues feel that
is not enough. It is never enough for
them. For them, President Trump’s ex-
treme antienvironment, anticlimate
agenda needs to be pushed even fur-
ther. They are rolling out a bill to give
even more money away to their oil and
gas polluter friends.
This Republican bill that was intro-
duced today by the minority would
force the Florida Gulf Coast for off-
shore oil and gas, let States decide
where energy development should hap-
pen on Federal public lands, gut Fed-
eral regulation, shorten environmental
review times, give vast amounts of
public money to four States in the Gulf
of Mexico, and make Americans pay if
they wanted to object to a government
decision.
Think about it. Right now, oil and
gas companies get to nominate public
lands for leasing without paying a
dime. If Republicans had their way, oil
and gas companies would keep the free
ride, and anyone who wants to protest
a lease would have to pay a fee to chal-
lenge them.
These ideas are destructive, and they
couldn’t even pass in an all-Republican
government. Nearly all of this legisla-
tion was introduced in various forms
by Republicans in the last Congress
when they controlled everything: the
House of Representatives, the Senate,
and the Presidency. But the bills that
were introduced today are so pro-pol-
luter, so backwards-looking, they
weren’t able to pass them in the House
under Republican control.
If my House colleagues just can’t or
won’t take climate change seriously,
then we shouldn’t take this bill seri-
ously at all. The American people want
us to act on climate. They reject the
Trump administration’s pro-polluter
agenda. That is why we are voting to
protect our coasts today, and that is
why I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’
on H.R. 205.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. All time for de-
bate has expired.
Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be

AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR. CRIST
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 1 printed in
part B of House Report 116–200.
Mr. CRIST. Madam Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 1, after line 10, insert the following:
SEC. 3. PRODUCTION SAFETY SYSTEMS AND
WELL CONTROL.
Subparts D, E, F, G, H, and Q of section 250
of title 30, Code of Federal Regulations (as in
effect on January 1, 2018), shall have the
same force and effect of law as if such sub-
parts had been enacted by an Act of Con-
gress.
Page 1, line 11, strike ‘‘3’’ and insert ‘‘4’’.
Page 5, line 5, strike ‘‘4’’ and insert ‘‘5’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 548, the gentleman
from Florida (Mr. CRIST) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Florida.
Mr. CRIST. Madam Chair, I was Gov-
ernor of Florida in 2010 when the Deep-
water Horizon rig exploded off the
coast of Louisiana. It killed 11 people
and sent millions of barrels of oil into
the Gulf of Mexico.
I witnessed firsthand the tar balls on
our beaches, the marine life drowning
in oil, and the billions of dollars of eco-
nomic damage inflicted on countless
families and small businesses.
As the largest offshore oil spill in
American history, this should have
been a huge wake-up call to everyone.
Floridians said never again and voted
almost 70 percent in the last election
to ban offshore drilling because, as we
learned, drilling doesn’t have to take
place right off our shores to upend your
way of life.
My amendment is simple. It rein-
states two critical rules regarding off-
shore drilling and safety regulations,

the Well Control Rule and the Produc-
tion Safety Systems Rule, that were
put into place after the Deepwater Ho-
rizon disaster itself.
Sadly, the current administration
has chosen to ignore the mistakes of
our past and has, instead, weakened
these rules, opening the door to self-
regulation and less stringent stand-
ards. That is why my amendment codi-
fies these rules in their previous form,
reinstating critical safety require-
ments and reducing the risk of another
tragedy.
b 1545
I would like to thank the bipartisan
cosponsors of my amendment, the
Rules Committee for making the
amendment in order, and the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. BARRAGÁN)
and the gentleman from North Caro-
lina (Mr. PRICE) for their tireless ef-
forts to support these regulations.
Finally, on behalf of Florida’s 13th
District, I give my heartfelt thanks to
the distinguished bipartisan colleagues
from Florida, Representative CASTOR
and Representative ROONEY, for their
tireless leadership on the underlying
bill to keep drilling out of the eastern
Gulf of Mexico for good.
In a perfect world, we wouldn’t have
to drill at all. But as long as drilling
does occur in the western and central
Gulf, the site of the Deepwater Horizon
spill, we must do everything in our
power to make sure that history does
not repeat itself.
I urge my colleagues to adopt the
amendment so that no State ever has
to endure another Deepwater Horizon.
Madam Chair, I yield 30 seconds to
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA), my colleague, the chairman of
the Natural Resources Committee.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentleman from Florida for
his thoughtful and necessary amend-
ment that will restore offshore drilling
regulations and that will reduce the
risks the Gulf communities face from
offshore development.
I thank him for that, and I very
much support the amendment.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Chair, I
rise in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Utah is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. The adminis-
tration, rightfully, took a second look
at the well control and production safe-
ty system rule that was implemented
by the prior administration. They
didn’t make a whole lot of changes.
About a 17 percent change to the over-
all rule was all that was done there.
But the colleagues that I have heard
and, also, those in the press who have
talked about this have been opposed to
the revised rules because they erro-
neously argue that they allow BSEE to
issue the so-called waivers to oil com-
panies that give them a free pass to
comply with the well control rule. In
reality, that just is not what is hap-
pening.
The rule allows BSEE to approve al-
ternative compliance measures for
companies that can prove there is a
better way of handling a particular re-
quirement that is at least as safe as
the original regulatory rules were. So,
in fact, the practice is nothing new.
In the Obama administration, they
approved these types of measures more
than the current administration is
doing it. The average during the
Obama administration was roughly
four times per day. The current admin-
istration does it roughly 2.3 times per
day.
BSEE isn’t allowing oil companies to
get away with not complying with the
well control rule. They have simply
found a better way of doing it.
To codify this rule the way it was be-
fore takes away the flexibility and the
ability to use technology and new ideas
and new science to come up with a bet-
ter way of solving the problem.
This amendment does great harm not
only to the process. To attach it to this
bill, which ought to be about the mili-
tary line, simply means, were this to
pass, this amendment would make it
more difficult for the ultimate bill to
reach a solution in the Senate.
It is an amendment to the wrong bill.
It should have been on the earlier one.
It is an amendment that is not needed.
It is an amendment that moves us
back. It is an amendment that takes
out of the administration the ability,
simply, to do things the right way. If
they can find a better way of doing it,
let the administration, at any time,
authorize that better way of doing the
well control protection rule.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. CRIST. Madam Chair, first, I
thank the chairman for his support of
the bill. I appreciate that very much.
In response to my colleague from
across the aisle, what is necessary and
what is important is to make sure that
we have stringent rules on this dan-
gerous industry, to make sure that we
protect our ecosystem and our environ-
ment.
As I said, we, as Floridians, already
understand it, voting almost 70 percent
of the vote in the latest election to ban
offshore drilling from our beautiful
coast.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Chair,
once again, I am somewhat confused as
to the point and direction of this par-
ticular amendment.
If it is about the military line, this
amendment does nothing to it. If it is
about protecting the coast of Florida,
this amendment does nothing to it.
It is about having a better way of
doing the system to provide more pro-
tection. It moves us back and removes
the ability of the department—BSEE,
in this situation—to protect and real-
ize that because it takes away their
creative alternatives.
There are always better ways of
doing something. This prohibits us
from doing it. This is the wrong
amendment on the wrong bill that
gives us the wrong direction.
Madam Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on
this amendment, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. CRIST).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MS. BARRAGÁN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 2 printed in
part B of House Report 116–200.
Ms. BARRAGÁN. Madam Chair, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of the bill, add the following:
SEC. 5. STUDY ON BSEE OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS
OPERATIONS INSPECTION PRO-
GRAM.
The Secretary of the Interior shall con-
tract with the National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to com-
plete, not later than 21 months after the date
of the enactment of this Act, the study enti-
tled ‘‘Review and Update of Bureau of Safety
and Environmental Enforcement Offshore
Oil and Gas Operations Inspection Program’’
that the Secretary of the Interior had pre-
viously contracted with the National Acad-
emies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine
to complete.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 548, the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. BARRAGÁN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Ms. BARRAGÁN. Madam Chair, ear-
lier this year, I introduced a bill called
the Safe COAST Act to protect our
coasts from offshore oil and gas drill-
ing. A vital element of that bill was to
protect the offshore oil and gas oper-
ations program. This critical piece of
the Safe COAST Act is offered in this
amendment.
As this body may remember, in De-
cember 2017, the administration placed
a stop-work order on a critical study of
the inspections program for offshore oil
and gas operations, in an attempt to
delay the study and alter its manage-
ment. The administration later
changed its mind and resumed the
study, but it doesn’t mean the adminis-
tration can’t change its mind again
and halt it or take away the study
from the National Academy of Sciences
and contract it to an oil and gas indus-
try-friendly entity.
We can’t take that chance because
this study is too critical. For example,
this study ensures that vital aspects of
the Bureau of Safety and Environ-
mental Enforcement’s regulatory mis-
sion are being met.
The study would evaluate the Bu-
reau’s current risk assessment inspec-
tion process and provide recommenda-
tions for its improvement. It will also
evaluate and migrate best practices
into the Bureau’s inspection protocols.
Lastly, it will assess the potential role
of safety-enhancing technologies, such
as remote and real-time monitoring.
In short, it will assess the use of
emerging technologies, potential risks,

and improved safety and environ-
mental protection practices.
Our coast needs these protections.
My amendment will ensure the study
remains operational and in the objec-
tive and trustworthy hands of the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to help protect our oceans and support
my amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Chair, I
claim the time in opposition to the
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Utah is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Chair, I
don’t want to try to be snarky on these
kinds of amendments, but it is already
being done.
It is a nice concept. It was stopped,
but it has also started again. So this
calls for a study to continue and re-
sume. They have already done it.
Back in October, in the Department
of the Interior, they already resumed
the meetings. They are ongoing. Every-
thing you want is actually happening.
I think a better study may be fig-
uring out how five noes can be out-
weighed by three ayes. Nonetheless,
this is a redundant amendment because
it is already happening.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. BARRAGÁN. Madam Chair, the
bottom line is this administration can-
not be trusted when it comes to pro-
tecting the coastline.
This administration already issued a
stop order and changed its mind.
Again, there is nothing to prevent this
administration from changing its mind
again or, as I mentioned, from taking
it away from the National Academy of
Sciences.
This amendment just ensures that
the study remains operational and in
the hands of the National Academy of
Sciences so that there can’t be a
change. This is a protection we need
for the coast.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Chair, I
am going to end with the final conclu-
sion, again, that it is a redundancy be-
cause it is already being done.
Why don’t you just mandate that ev-
erything we are doing in every other
department be done at the same time?
It would have the same kind of impact,
the same kind of effect. It is cute, but
it is a waste of our time.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-

AMENDMENT NO. 3 OFFERED BY MR. GOSAR
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 3 printed in
part B of House Report 116–200.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of the bill, insert the following:
SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.
Section 2 of this Act shall not be effective
until the Secretary of the Interior, in con-
sultation with the Director of the United
States Fish and Wildlife Service, finds that
the moratorium under such section will not
adversely affect jobs available to minorities
and women.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 548, the gentleman
from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Arizona.
MODIFICATION TO AMENDMENT NO. 3 OFFERED
BY MR. GOSAR
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I ask
unanimous consent that my amend-
ment be modified in the form I have
placed at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will re-
port the modification.
The Clerk read as follows:
Modification to amendment No. 3 of-
fered by Mr. GOSAR:
Strike ‘‘Director of the United States Fish
and Wildlife Service’’ and insert ‘‘Secretary
of Labor’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection
to the request of the gentleman of Ari-
zona?
There was no objection.
The Acting CHAIR. The amendment
is modified.
The gentleman from Arizona is rec-
ognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I rise
today to offer an amendment that al-
lows the section 2 moratorium in this
bill to go into effect when the Depart-
ment of the Interior, in consultation
with the Department of Labor, certifies
that the offshore energy moratorium in
the bill will not kill a substantial num-
ber of minority and women jobs.
We heard arguments from the Demo-
cratic Members on the other side of the
aisle against a similar amendment,
that this amendment doesn’t matter
and is meaningless. How callous that
response.
I tell opponents of this amendment
to tell that single mother working to
put food on the table for her two chil-
dren that her job doesn’t matter. How
about the minority family who just
moved into a new neighborhood so
their kids could go to better schools?
Tell those hardworking, minority par-
ents that those jobs don’t matter ei-
ther.
Under the current administration,
unemployment has reached record
lows. In August, the national unem-
ployment rate sat at 3.7 percent, with
the unemployment rate for African
American workers sitting at 5.5 per-
cent, breaking the previous record of
5.9 percent set in May 2018.
According to a recent report by The
Washington Post—once again, the bas-
tion of conservative reporting—nearly
90 percent of the jobs added under this
administration has gone to minority
communities. This can be attributed
to, for the first time, a majority of new
hires are people between the ages of 25
to 54 and are from minority commu-
nities.
According to statistics published by
the American Petroleum Institute, mi-
norities will comprise one-third of the
total workforce in the oil and gas sec-
tor by 2030. Women already comprise
more than 15 percent of the oil and gas
workforce.
These are good-paying jobs, paying
$90,000, that hardworking families de-
pend upon. This legislation puts these
employment opportunities at risk by
permanently putting off-limits poten-
tially viable and valuable offshore en-
ergy opportunities in the eastern Gulf
of Mexico.
For the first time since the 1950s, the
United States will soon be a net ex-
porter of oil and natural gas, some-
thing that was once unthinkable.
America’s energy renaissance has
boosted the economies of previously
left-behind towns throughout the coun-
try and turned them into vibrant com-
munities.
Madam Chair, this is a commonsense
amendment that protects minority and
women jobs and puts the interests of
the American workforce first. I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I rise
in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Arizona is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Chair, first of all, let’s start
with the premise here. The premise of
protecting jobs for women and people
of color is a laudable one. But on the
eastern coast, at this point, there are
no jobs to lose or protect because there
are no jobs. If there was to be any ac-
tivity, it would be when the morato-
rium would be lifted in 2022.
The point of this amendment has
nothing to do with the bill, and it is
simply an attempt to block protections
for the eastern Gulf based on a fake
concern for jobs for women and people
of color.
I recall the hearing we had yesterday
about the Department of the Interior’s
Bureau of Land Management reorga-
nization and its transfer of central ac-
tivities to Grand Junction, Colorado.
In that, the majority asked the ques-
tion: What about the retention of sen-
ior, female, and of-color staff in this
move? How many are we going to lose?
Do they need to be protected?
At the hearing, the minority Mem-
bers told us that was not an issue, that
we shouldn’t worry about it, that noth-
ing was going to be lost and everything
was going to be protected.
b 1600
Here we have the issue being raised
again, but from another perspective. I
believe that enacting this bill and pro-
tecting Florida’s shore from the dan-
gers of offshore drilling will safeguard

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7633
September 11, 2019
jobs in coastal tourism, recreation in-
dustries, and many others that are held
by the people of Florida, including
women and people of color.
For example, the Florida Gulf Coast
Business Coalition is a diverse coali-
tion of businesses and industries com-
mitted to protecting Florida’s Gulf
Coast, and they have offered strong
support for the underlying legislation.
The real threat to jobs and economic
opportunity in Florida would be failing
to extend the existing moratorium.
This is why elected officials, including
the entire Florida congressional dele-
gation and the Florida Governor, op-
pose drilling in the eastern Gulf and
support H.R. 205.
This is not a serious amendment and
does nothing to protect jobs belonging
to women, to people of color, and, con-
versely, keeps the Florida Gulf Coast
at risk.
For these reasons, I urge opposition
to the amendment, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, if that
supposition that has been proposed is
actually true, then an easy certifi-
cation by the Secretary of the Interior
is in the works that there is no de-
nominational change in regards to
those jobs, in regards to the oil and gas
industry with this permanent morato-
rium. So, once again, it gets us back to
that permanent moratorium in section
2 does place those at risk.
Again, I ask my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle to think of that
single mother who is working to put
food on the table for her two children.
Tell her that her job doesn’t matter.
Again, think of the minority family
that just moved into a new neighbor-
hood so their kids could go to better
schools. Tell those working minorities,
those parents that their jobs don’t
matter.
Think of the statistics that we re-
peatedly looked at from, no less, The
Washington Post. These are real jobs.
They are helping real people. They are
part of a real economy, an economy
that needs all of the above.
Once again, we can have tourism, we
can have clean energy production and
protect the environment, and we can
have the good-paying jobs that are em-
powering women and minorities.
I urge my colleagues to adopt this
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, again,
the amendment is not necessary, and it
is an attempt to delay and to put fur-
ther risk to the Florida Gulf Coast, and
I would urge its defeat.
More importantly, I think concrete,
real policy initiatives to enhance op-
portunities for women and people of
color in this country are something
this Congress should undertake as a
whole. But crocodile tears on this par-
ticular piece of legislation and this
amendment aren’t going to do it.
I urge opposition. I urge its defeat.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.
GOSAR).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.

So the amendment was rejected.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. BISHOP of
Georgia). There being no further
amendments under the rule, the Com-
mittee rises.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ) having assumed
the chair, Mr. BISHOP of Georgia, Act-
ing Chair of the Committee of the
Whole House on the state of the Union,
reported that that Committee, having
had under consideration the bill (H.R.
1941) to amend the Outer Continental
Shelf Lands Act to prohibit the Sec-
retary of the Interior including in any
leasing program certain planning
areas, and for other purposes, and, pur-
suant to House Resolution 548, he re-
ported the bill, as amended by that res-
olution, back to the House with sundry
further amendments adopted in the
Committee of the Whole.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the rule, the previous question is or-
dered.
Is a separate vote demanded on any
further amendment reported from the
Committee of the Whole? If not, the
Chair will put them en gros.
The amendments were agreed to.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the engrossment and
third reading of the bill.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed
and read a third time, and was read the
third time.
MOTION TO RECOMMIT
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam
Speaker, I have a motion to recommit
at the desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentleman opposed to the bill?
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam
Speaker, I am in its current form.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.
The Clerk read as follows:
Mr. Graves of Louisiana moves to recom-
mit the bill, H.R. 1941, to the Committee on
Natural Resources with instructions to re-
port the same back to the House forthwith
with the following amendment:
At the end of the bill, add the following:
SEC. ll. EFFECTIVE DATE.
Section 2 of this Act shall take effect on
the date the President certifies that the en-
actment of this Act will not increase the na-
tional average price of gasoline.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Louisiana is recognized for 5 minutes
in support of his motion.
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam
Speaker, we sat here for hours talking
about the objectives of legislation to
impose a moratorium on offshore en-
ergy production. I have heard the advo-
cates for the legislation talk about the
objectives of protecting our environ-
ment and preventing energy spills of
oil. I have heard advocates talk about
the objective of reducing greenhouse
gas emissions. I have heard objectives
discussed regarding creating jobs, per-
haps green jobs, and ensuring that we
have economic activity here in the
United States.
Madam Speaker, I share those objec-
tives. This bill doesn’t do it. So let’s go
one by one and address the various ob-
jectives and address the facts associ-
ated with them.
Number one: Madam Speaker, when
we stop producing energy domestically,
we don’t stop using energy. We don’t
change the form of energy. What hap-
pens is, as statistics prove, as the De-
partment of the Interior officials have
reported to the Natural Resources
Committee, we increase our depend-
ence upon imports from other coun-
tries.
When you import energy, they have
lower environmental standards. You
release greater greenhouse gas emis-
sions, and by putting it on a ship, you
have a greater chance of spilling the
energy. The safest thing you can do is
produce it domestically and put it in a
pipe.
Secondly, Madam Speaker, you have
heard the discussion about ruining
coastal habitat. You have heard the
discussion about ruining coastal com-
munities.
Madam Speaker, when you look at
the statistics, in 2017, California pro-
duced about 209 million pounds of sea-
food; the State of Florida, about 111
million pounds; the State of South
Carolina, about 10.5 million pounds.
Louisiana, which has four times more
energy production in the offshore than
all other States combined, we produced
90 times that of South Carolina, or 900
million pounds of seafood, valued at
more than $360 million.
In addition, these funds go toward—
the revenue sharing under offshore en-
ergy production goes to the resilience
of your coastal ecosystem and the re-
siliency of your communities.
Madam Speaker, I shudder to think
down the road, if we stop offshore en-
ergy production, what happens when a
hurricane comes in and devastates
communities, because we put a morato-
rium in place preventing the avail-
ability of revenues to protect those
very communities.
In regard to the emissions, the
United States has reduced greenhouse
gas emissions more than the next 12
countries combined. We have done it
without mandates, without require-
ments—more than the next 12 coun-
tries combined.
A BOEM report says emissions could
increase in the absence of a new OCS
leasing program. Madam Speaker, that
was a report under the Obama adminis-
tration. This bill does just that. It pre-
vents additional leasings in new areas.
Case in point, when the State of Cali-
fornia tried to impose their renewable
energy portfolio, they have increased
their dependence upon oil from Saudi
Arabia. In New England, they have im-
ported natural gas from Russia. These
policies don’t make sense as evidence
has proven.
In regard to creating jobs, when
President Obama was in office in 2011,
one-half of this Nation’s trade deficit,
one-half, was attributable to us im-
porting oil from other countries. Those
countries do not have the safety
record, the safety regime we have in
the United States.
I join the Laborers’ International
Union of North America’s president in
believing that this bill is purely for po-
litical purposes. The union members
working in the energy sector are being
targeted. Instead of working to enact
real job-creating infrastructure legisla-
tion, union members see their jobs,
once again, being denigrated and belit-
tled. Energy development can coexist
with environmental stewardship.
Lastly, Madam Speaker, this motion
to recommit is about gasoline prices. A
run-up in world oil prices is effectively
a tax on every American family’s dis-
cretionary budget, except that the

HOUSE
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7637
September 11, 2019
money goes to the OPEC cartel rather
than the U.S. Treasury.
Let me say that again. A run-up in
world oil prices effectively attacks
every American family’s discretionary
budget, except that the money goes to
the OPEC cartel rather than the U.S.
Treasury. Those aren’t my words.
Those are the words of Senators CANT-
WELL, MENENDEZ, MARKEY, and SCHU-
MER.
This amendment ensures that this
legislation does not result in a dis-
proportionate impact on the poor by
raising gasoline prices and energy ac-
cess to Americans across the board; of
course, again, disproportionately im-
pacting those of low income.
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of
the amendment, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker,
I rise in opposition to the motion to re-
commit.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from South Carolina is recog-
nized for 5 minutes.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker,
I rise to protect our environment. And
as a former ocean engineer, I rise on
behalf of the Lowcountry in the First
Congressional District of South Caro-
lina.
This motion to recommit wants to
cede more power to our President, but
I believe in the Constitution, and I be-
lieve in separate but equal branches of
government like our Founding Fathers
intended.
We, as Members of this institution,
have an obligation to not only respond
to current events, but also to antici-
pate future problems and work to pre-
vent them. You don’t wait for a bridge
to break to fix its foundation, and you
don’t wait for the hurricane to hit be-
fore boarding up your windows, and
you don’t wait for an oil spill to realize
that offshore drilling is just not worth
jeopardizing our booming tourism in-
dustry.
As my father used to say, the juice
just ain’t worth the squeeze.
This bill ensures that no new lease
sales are made along the Atlantic and
the Pacific. We are not looking to re-
verse existing sales, just prevent new
ones.
So why does this matter? Because
public opinion matters, and because
our friends and our neighbors have ex-
pressed their opposition to offshore
drilling along our coasts.
There are certain things that go be-
yond politics, issues that touch each
and every one of us personally, things
that transcend partisan lines.
In South Carolina, we have strong bi-
partisan opposition to offshore drilling.
It doesn’t matter what party you be-
long to. We all enjoy the same beaches,
the same sunset, and the same coastal
economy, like South Carolina’s, which
is worth over $22 billion. That is at
risk. Whatever limited economic ben-
efit may be gained from oil drilling is
both fiscally and morally irresponsible.
I want to remind the folks of the re-
markable track record Republicans
once had for environmental conserva-
tion. The National Environmental Pol-
icy Act and two Clean Air Acts were
both signed by Republicans. A Repub-
lican created the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency.
By voting against this bill, Repub-
licans promote pollution; they put
profits over people; and they erase the
legacy of environmental conservation
that Republicans before them worked
so hard to build.
I want to remind my colleagues, if
they are a true conservative, if they
are a real conservative, then be an en-
vironmental conservative, too.
This idea that offshore drilling is
necessary for the country to achieve
energy independence is just a red her-
ring. As President Trump pointed out
earlier this year during his State of the
Union speech, the United States is now
the number one producer of oil and
natural gas in the world.
Yes, USA, USA, USA.
President Trump said that, for the
first time in 65 years, we are a net ex-
porter of energy. We have managed to
make all this energy progress, and all
that progress has been made without
drilling in the Atlantic and Pacific.
We are sending 3 million barrels of
oil overseas every single day. We do
not need to put oil rigs in the Atlantic
Ocean at all.
Why would we damage our beaches,
our God-given natural resources, just
to export more oil to other countries?
Why would we do that?
To answer that question, we must
first answer a more basic question:
Who did you come here to serve?
When we see Old Glory, we pledge our
allegiance to the flag and to the Na-
tion, not to a party and not to a Presi-
dent.
This is not a partisan question, so let
us not give a partisan answer. Let’s de-
feat this motion to recommit and pass
H.R. 1941.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit.
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion to recommit.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the noes appeared to have it.
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas
and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair
will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum
time for any electronic vote on the
question of passage.
This is a 5-minute vote.
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 194, nays
233, not voting 5, as follows:

HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that when the
House adjourns today, it adjourn to
meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
GARCÍA of Illinois). Is there objection
to the request of the gentleman from
New Jersey?
There was no objection.

U.S. WELOVEU FOUNDATION
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I take a
moment and praise the work of the
International WeLoveU Foundation,
which I am proud to say is located in
Oradell, New Jersey.
The organization and supporters are
dedicated to improving the lives and
conditions of people across the globe.
They focus on the belief that we are all
human beings, and when we help each
other out, we bring out the best in all
of us.
Last July, I attended one of their
events, a walkathon in Jersey City’s
Liberty State Park. They raised $50,000
to support disaster relief in Mozam-
bique. Basically, the country was hit
by two hurricanes in 2 months that
devastated towns, farms, and homes.
Most people did not even know it
happened, so I was impressed to see
2,500 people donate their time and ef-
fort to help people thousands of miles
away. But that is what the WeLoveU
Foundation does and continues to do:

IN HONOR OF CORPORAL JAMES
COLQUITT AS VETERAN OF THE
MONTH
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor a Knoxville, Tennessee,
native, Corporal James Colquitt, an
American hero and United States Ma-
rine.
Corporal Colquitt joined the United
States Marine Corps at the age of 17.
On March 15, 1944, he boarded a train
and was sent to Marine Corps Recruit
Depot San Diego for recruit training.
Corporal Colquitt served as a rifle-
man with I Company, 23rd Marines, 4th
Marine Division. From February 19 to
March 2, 1945, he participated in com-
bat action against the Japanese during
the Battle of Iwo Jima, one of the
bloodiest battles of the entire Pacific
War.
Corporal Colquitt received a Purple
Heart for wounds received during com-
bat operations on March 2, 1945. He was
promoted to the rank of corporal and
was honorably discharged from Marine
Barracks in Washington, D.C., on April
26, 1946.
Corporal Colquitt is one of thousands
of great men and women who honor-
ably served our country during World
War II. After defending our values and
freedoms, these brave solders returned
home, raised families, strengthened
communities, and continued the
growth of America.
It is my honor to recognize James
Colquitt as the Tennessee Second Con-
gressional District’s September 2019
Veteran of the Month and to thank
him for his service to our country.
f
IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE
SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to remember the September 11
attacks, and especially those who lost
their lives on that day, including peo-
ple from my own home State in Rhode
Island.
I was 8 months into my first term in
Congress when our Nation’s course was
inexorably altered that blue Tuesday
morning. Over the last 18 years, as an
inaugural member of the Committee on
Homeland Security and as a member of
the Committee on Armed Services with
oversight over our Special Operations
Forces, I devoted myself to ensuring
our country is safe.
I know that we have made progress,
important progress, and we worked to
eliminate terrorist enclaves around the
world. We strengthened our security at
home so that we are no longer a soft
target. We, of course, paid dearly for
these gains through the sacrifice of our
servicemembers and the tax dollars of
our citizens.
However, we still have a long way to
go. This summer, Congress, of course,
finally enacted, permanently, to pro-
tect 9/11 first responders. It is certainly
long overdue.
We must also now fulfill our commit-
ments to our veterans returning home
from the Global War on Terror. We
must protect our country against new
and emerging threats, including in the
cyber domain. And each year, we must
renew our pledge to ‘‘never forget.’’
f
IN HONOR OF MELINDA ‘‘MINDY’’
GENE PICCOTTI
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, today I
introduced H.R. 4279, to name the post
office in Laceyville, Wyoming County,
Pennsylvania, after Melinda ‘‘Mindy’’
Gene Piccotti.
A native of Pennsylvania’s 12th Con-
gressional District, Mindy was an Air
Force veteran who knew the struggles
combat veterans and wounded soldiers
face when returning home from duty.
Starting in 2009, at the age of 60,
Mindy highlighted her commitment to
our Nation’s Armed Forces by creating
Hunts for Healing, based out of
Laceyville.
Mindy founded Hunts for Healing to
help wounded soldiers returning from
military operations in Iraq, Afghani-
stan, and other combat areas transi-
tion back into civilian life by allowing
them to experience the joys of hunting,
including social interaction and cama-
raderie.
With the assistance of volunteer
guides and funded entirely by private
donations, Hunts for Healing helps vet-
erans in need of physical, spiritual, and
emotional support.
For the impact of her life and for her
continued legacy in the veterans’ com-
munity, I urge Members to support
H.R. 4279 and name the post office in
Laceyville, Pennsylvania, for Melinda
‘‘Mindy’’ Gene Piccotti.

WETLANDS INSTITUTE 50TH
ANNIVERSARY
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, the
Wetlands Institute in Stone Harbor,
south Jersey, recently celebrated its
50th anniversary.
For half a century, the Wetlands In-
stitute has been providing south Jersey
and its community with programs that
work toward conserving our wetlands
and our coastal systems.
This institute was founded on the be-
lief that those living in coastal com-
munities should be educated about how
to keep themselves and their environ-
ments protected, and they have been
fulfilling that goal for the last 50 years.
Our oceans and our coasts are chang-
ing, and places like the Wetlands Insti-
tute are vital in teaching us how to
protect the wildlife affected by these
changes.
I thank all those who work at the in-
stitute for all they have done for the
past 50 years. They are teaching the
scientists and the environmentalists of
the future, and I know they will con-
tinue to enhance our community and
all of our communities into the future.
New Jersey, south Jersey, and the
United States of America is proud of
them. They have always been on the
cutting edge, and I know they will con-
tinue to be.
f
RECOGNIZING JAKOB ZERNICK
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a
remarkable young man, Jakob Zernick,
from Cambria County, Pennsylvania.
Jakob is a 13-year-old with a green
thumb who started his own nonprofit
called Seedz 4 Needz.
Jakob grows celery, Brussels sprouts,
potatoes, and more to support the Chil-
dren’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, where he
has been receiving treatment for
Crohn’s disease for the last 5 years.
Jakob sells his produce at a vege-
table stand outside his home in
Ebensburg and uses the money to pur-
chase toys, games, books, and more
items to gift to children who are pa-
tients at the hospital.
According to Jakob, he is projected
to raise $10,000 this year to benefit the
Children’s Hospital. His efforts have
been recognized by the community, and
Jakob’s neighbors have been incredibly
supportive, offering their own dona-
tions as well.
Most notably, Saint Francis Univer-
sity of Loretto, Pennsylvania, donated
a $1,000 check to Seedz 4 Needz to help
Jakob continue his mission.
I am proud of the work that Jakob
has done, and I look forward to seeing
Seedz 4 Needz grow.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DIET
EMAN
(Mr. HUIZENGA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1

marks.)

today to honor the life of a very special
hero who risked her life to care for oth-
ers and left a remarkable legacy.

Michigan resident who was born and

raised in the Netherlands. At 20 years
old, she found herself in the middle of
the crisis that had overtaken Europe
during World War II.
Recognizing the injustices against
the Jewish people in Holland, Diet and
her fiance, Hein Sietsma, formed the
Dutch resistance group called ‘‘Help
Elkander in Nood,’’ which means
‘‘helping each other in need.’’
Throughout the course of the war,
Diet organized shelters and provided
assistance to Jews in need, reported on
German troop movements, and helped
downed Allied pilots.
Eventually, she was actually cap-
tured by the Germans and spent 3
months in a concentration camp. How-
ever, her spirit and will could not be
broken, and she outsmarted her inter-
rogators, bluffed her captors into re-
leasing her, and quickly returned to
her work within the resistance move-
ment.
Diet was personally recognized by
President Eisenhower for her contribu-
tions, as well as by Dutch King Willem-
Alexander, who deemed her a national
hero for her courage and sacrifice.
Meeting her in person last year was a
very special memory for me and my en-
tire family. Diet never wavered in tak-
ing a stand for what is noble and lived
a life full of bravery, compassion, and
purpose.
Through her efforts, Diet helped
change the world and make it a better
place.
May her memory be eternal.

COMMEMORATING THE 18TH
ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentlewoman from
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY)
is recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the majority leader.
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ob-
serve the 18th anniversary of the Sep-
tember 11 attacks on our Nation.
I want to thank the Congressional
Progressive Caucus chairs, Representa-
tives Jayapal and Pocan, and the Spe-
cial Order conveners, Representatives
Porter and Tlaib, for inviting us to use
this time to commemorate this solemn
anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.
I am deeply grateful to my col-
leagues who have supported the recov-
ery over the years and, most recently,
for the overwhelming support with a
vote of 402–12 to fund and make perma-
nent the Victim Compensation Fund.
On Tuesday, September 11, 2001, at
8:46 a.m., the first tower of the World
Trade Center was struck. At 9:03, the
second tower was struck. At 9:37, the
Pentagon was hit. And, at 10:03, the
fourth plane crashed in Shanksville,
Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD
the name of every person who perished
in that attack.

That brilliant, blue-skied September
day became one of the darkest morn-
ings in our history when 2,997 innocent
people were struck and killed just for
going about their daily lives. They
were murdered for being Americans.
Thousands more were injured, and, in
the years since, tens of thousands more
became ill, disabled, or died from expo-
sure to the toxic soup that hung in the
air and covered the crash sites.
Since that heartbreaking day, we
have come together as a Nation on
each anniversary to remember the lives
that were taken from us and to honor
and thank those first responders who
were there for us when we needed them
most. Their heroic actions in those
first chaotic hours and in the weeks
and months to follow showed us that,
even in our darkest hours, there can be
light.
The dark attack became one of the
greatest rescue efforts in history. In a
time of sorrow, we drew strength from
friends and found comfort in the kind-
ness of strangers. We were inspired to
persevere by the resolve and courage of
thousands who rushed to the scene to
help.
In Congress, we were united and de-
termined. It was on that day that we
first pledged to never forget. We vowed
to honor those we lost and to always be
there for those first responders and
survivors who had suffered and con-
tinue to suffer from devastating dis-
eases caused by the toxins at the crash
site.
It is to honor that pledge, and in rec-
ognition of those who still suffer every
day from the effects of 9/11, that many
of us worked over the years—Congress-
men NADLER, KING, and many others,
along with hundreds of advocates and
colleagues—in a bipartisan effort to en-
sure first responders and survivors
have the healthcare and compensation
they so justly deserve.
We are proud that, as of this past
July, both the World Trade Center
Health Program and the Victim Com-
pensation Fund are effectively perma-
nent.
As the longtime sponsor and author,
along with JERRY NADLER and PETER
KING, of this legislation in the House,
seeing these bills pass was my proudest
moment in Congress.
Despite the darkness of those hours,
‘‘Never Forget’’ also calls us to remem-
ber that we were united at that time as
one Nation and we were there for one
another.
Even today, we can find comfort and
inspiration in remembering the way all
New Yorkers, all Americans, came to-
gether in the aftermath of the attack.
Let us remember the good that we
can accomplish together when we focus
on what unites us, when we let our
shared dreams and highest values pull
us together rather than divide us.
After all that I witnessed on that
long-ago September day, I was proud
beyond words to be a New Yorker and
an American.
Mr. Speaker, I would now like to rec-
ognize my good friend and colleague
from the great State of New York,
JERRY NADLER, who has worked many
long days in response to rebuilding
after 9/11.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from New York (Mr. NADLER).
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Congresswoman MALONEY for yielding
and for all her work over the years on
this issue.
It is hard to believe it has been 18
years. Like many New Yorkers, 9/11
seems both long ago and immediate, a
memory and something I live with
every day.
I was in Washington that morning
and immediately rushed back to New
York by train. I saw the smoking
wreckage in Lower Manhattan from
the train window and expected chaos in
the city, but, when I exited Penn Sta-
tion that evening, I was struck by the
silence.
It was like a scene from out of the
movie ‘‘On the Beach.’’ The city
seemed empty. No cars, no people, no
vehicles, no buses, nothing on the
streets—just the strange odor that
hung in the air.
Knowing the terror and confusion
happening just 40 blocks south, the si-
lence was eerie.
But, as we recall the fear and grief of
September 11, we cannot forget the
courage we saw that morning and in
the days, weeks, and months following
the attack: the firefighters who ran
into those buildings, the police officers
who searched for survivors, the co-
workers who carried each other down
endless stairs, the strangers on the
street who guided each other to safety,
the construction workers who spent
months clearing debris.
The legacy of 9/11 is not just one of
tragedy and grief; it is one of courage,
self-sacrifice, and community; it is one
of the American people, through Con-
gress, appropriating $20 billion to help
New York begin to recover from the
terrorist attack.
But history would not be complete if
we did not acknowledge that the Fed-
eral Government exacerbated the mas-
sive environmental disaster caused by
the collapse of the World Trade Center
by insisting, contrary to ample evi-
dence, that the air in Lower Manhat-
tan and Brooklyn was safe to breathe.
Thousands of responders, from all
over the country, worked on the World
Trade Center site with minimal or no
protective equipment.
The Federal Government did not step
in to conduct the necessary com-
prehensive cleanup of the schools, of-
fices, and residences in Lower Manhat-
tan. Instead, students were sent back
to schools caught in a dust cloud before
the ventilation systems were cleaned.
Residents and office workers were sent
back to buildings covered in asbestos.
I joined a few environmental groups
in trying to warn people that they
could not believe the assurances of
EPA administrator Christine Todd
Whitman and Mayor Giuliani that the
air was not safe to breathe, that people
should not return to school or to work
without respiratory protection and
until a proper cleanup was done.
Eventually, we forced the govern-
ment to acknowledge those lies and to
provide healthcare and resources for
those clearly made sick by their expo-
sure to those toxins.
As subcommittee chair, I held the
first hearings to hold the EPA and
former EPA administrator Whitman
accountable for putting hundreds of
thousands at risk. Those hearings were
held in 2007.
Working with Congresswoman MALO-
NEY, Congressman KING, and my col-
leagues in New York and New Jersey,
we finally got Congress to come to-
gether in 2010 to pass the James
Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation
Act, to establish a national health pro-
gram, and to reopen the Victim Com-
pensation Fund to provide support to
sick responders and survivors.
In 2015, as these programs were about
to expire, we made the Health Program
permanent, but reauthorized the VCF
for only 5 years.
This year, as chairman of the Judici-
ary Committee, I was incredibly proud
and moved to hold a hearing on the
need for additional time and money for
the VCF.
We heard heartbreaking testimony
from sick responders and survivors: a
firefighter, an FBI agent, a former high
school student, the widow of a con-
struction worker, and the late Detec-
tive Luis Alvarez, who passed away
from a 9/11-related cancer just weeks
after testifying.
The very next day, the committee
unanimously passed the bill to make
the fund permanent, to restore any
cuts to past awards, and to ensure the
Victim Compensation Fund had all the
necessary funding going forward.
That bill passed the full House and
Senate and went straight to the Presi-
dent’s desk, where it was signed into
law.
Creating the Health Program and the
Victim Compensation Fund and mak-
ing those programs permanent count
among the proudest moments of my
time as a Member of Congress. Through
these programs, we are finally living
up to the challenge Abraham Lincoln
laid before us in his second inaugural
address, that we must care for him who
shall have borne the battle, and for his
widow and his orphan.

We will never forget 9/11. We will
never forget those who perished on
that day from the terrorist attacks,
and we will never abandon those who
battled that day and still bear the
scars.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman
MALONEY for hosting this Special Order
hour with me and for being such a
champion for the survivors and re-
sponders over the years.
I thank each of our colleagues who
come to the floor this evening to re-
member those we lost and thank all of
our colleagues who joined us in voting
for and renewing the 9/11 healthcare
act.
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Mrs.
LOWEY), another champion for this
cause.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to
thank my good friend and New Yorker,
my colleague, CAROLYN MALONEY, for
organizing this evening so that we can
all remember.
Eighteen years have passed since the
September 11 terrorist attacks, but the
memory of this unimaginable tragedy,
unspeakable terror, and profound grief
remains.
When tragedy struck, men and
women streamed from the Twin Towers
and the Pentagon as first responders
ran in and risked their lives. Volun-
teers sifted through debris for days and
weeks, hoping for miracles.
Between those horrific attacks and
the crash of Flight 93 in Shanksville,
Pennsylvania, we lost nearly 3,000 fam-
ily members, friends, and neighbors.
We promised to never forget those
whose lives were cut short.
The pain that we all feel from the
loss of our relatives, friends, and neigh-
bors will never heal, but every day we
must channel that pain into remem-
brance and service. By participating in
this day of service, we help build a
stronger, more unified community to
honor the victims’ memories.
We are also called to care for those
who remain with us but suffer as a re-
sult of their bravery that day. In July,
the Senate followed the House’s lead
and passed the permanent renewal of
the September 11th Victim Compensa-
tion Fund, which was enacted on July
29, 2019. The long-overdue action pro-
vides financial security and care for
first responders and survivors who are
ill from exposure to a mix of burning
chemicals and debris.
On this and every anniversary of the
September 11 attacks, we are reminded
of our common purpose and solemn re-
sponsibilities: to care for the survivors
and first responders, to give our law
enforcement the resources to prevent
and respond to attacks, and, last but
not least, to hold the victims and he-
roes of September 11 and their families
forever in our hearts.
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my
time, I yield to the gentlewoman from
Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN).
On 9/11, I got in a car and started to
driving to New York. There were barri-
cades up that said: ‘‘New York in cri-
sis. You cannot pass.’’ It was the only
time I ever had to use my congres-
sional ID.
I got through, and all you could see
were first responders pouring in from
New Jersey to help. They were a crit-
ical part of not only rebuilding in New
York, but passing the important legis-
lation.
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
chairwoman, Representative MALONEY,
for all her dedication, and I thank her
for naming me to share a few remarks.
I am a new Representative from
Pennsylvania, neighbor to New Jersey,
but I spend an awful lot of time in New
Jersey, and our whole area was af-
fected.
Eighteen years ago, planes crashed
into the Twin Towers, the Pentagon,
and a Pennsylvania field near
Shanksville. September 11 slammed
into our national consciousness and
has reverberated ever since.
We lost family, friends, neighbors,
coworkers—losses that are immeas-
urable. We might have lost more, but
on that day, our first responders rushed
toward danger, rescued survivors, and
then spent months cleaning up the
wreckage.
That blend of sorrow and courage was
on display again in June, when first re-
sponders encouraged Congress to reau-
thorize the 9/11 Victim Compensation
Fund.
Detective Luis Alvarez told me: ‘‘I’m
doing okay, but there are others out
there who aren’t doing okay.’’ Before
Detective Alvarez died a few weeks
later, he said: ‘‘The government has to
act like first responders . . . put poli-
tics aside and let’s get this bill done.’’
Ultimately, we did so—through the
might and strength of CAROLYN MALO-
NEY, I might add—naming our bill for
him, Luis Alvarez, and other heroes.
In the spirit of Detective Alvarez, let
us continue to do so, working together
with decency and respect. That is how
we will honor those we lost; that is how
we will honor those we continue to
lose; and that is how we will honor all
of those who continue to grieve.
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. ZELDIN).
9/11 was a total bipartisan effort. I
have never seen this Congress so united
and determined, working together, par-
ticularly in the New York delegation.
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) for yielding and
for hosting this Special Order hour.
Really, much of Congresswoman
MALONEY’s career here and legacy of
service in the House of Representa-
tives, while focused passionately on a
lot of other issues that are very impor-
tant, certainly is one that is filled with
much success in advocating on behalf
of the New York community and for
first responders all across America for
important priorities post-9/11. So I
thank her for all of her leadership, be-
cause a lot of that benefits my con-
stituents as well on the East End, but,
really, for all of us as Americans.
As we are here right now, all across
New York, across my district, across
our country, people are gathering, men
and women who remember exactly
where they were and how they felt,
what they saw, what they heard, and
also, kids who weren’t even born yet,
learning for the first time those stories
of what was experienced on September
11, 2001.
We often talk about our Nation’s
Greatest Generation. I was at Army
Reserve duty this past weekend, and I
was talking to one officer who said
that his life—not just his military ca-
reer, but his life—is broken up into two
parts: There was the part of his life
until September 11, 2001, and the part
of his life after September 11, 2001.
It is a challenge for that generation
serving post-9/11 to try to fill the shoes
of our Nation’s Greatest Generation,
those who have served in World War II,
Korea, Vietnam, peacetime, wartime,
many great Americans through genera-
tions.
It is so important for us to honor and
remember the victims of September 11,
2001, to honor and remember those with
courage who ran up while other people
were running down, who ran toward
danger, ignoring orders to go in the op-
posite direction at the ultimate risk of
their own life.
And also, it is important for us to
honor all of the men and women who
have served in our Nation’s military.
Think of that man or that woman that
next morning who had a successful ca-
reer, a stable family, and they went to
their local recruiter’s office to sign up
to serve and, ultimately, gave their life
in that cause. There has been so much
sacrifice since 9/11.
As we gather together on this 18th
anniversary here in the House Cham-
ber, this morning starting with a mo-
ment of silence and a singing of ‘‘God
Bless America,’’ when we say ‘‘never
forget,’’ we have to ensure that every
single day that we are honoring the
legacy of all those lives cut short too
soon, that we are paying tribute to
those first responders with an enor-
mous amount of courage, and that we
are honoring those men and women
who still serve to this day, those who
have paid the ultimate sacrifice, our
Gold Star families, our Blue Star fami-
lies, past, present, and future.
As that lieutenant colonel told me
this past weekend, for him, where he
separated his life into service before
9/11 and service after, life before 9/11
and life after, know that right now we
have men and women who are overseas
who were 1 year old or 2 years old and
their entire life have only known the
post-9/11 reality, and yet they want
nothing else but service.
So I think this 18th anniversary is
not just about what happened on that
day and the days and the weeks and the
months that followed, but it is also
about where we are today.

Finally, I would say this: While we
talk about the lives that were lost that
day, there is an important lesson with
the justice that was served to follow,
for anyone who seeks to break down
this country, to tear apart what binds
us together as Americans, the ultimate
justice will be delivered to them
abroad, because America is strong.
New Yorkers are strong, but as
Americans, we will come together; we
will unite; we will fight to protect our
freedoms and our liberties. And it is
not about Republican or Democrat,
conservative or liberal; it is about us
as Members of this body and as Ameri-
cans outside of this body to unite for a
cause so much greater than ourselves,
the greatest Nation in the world.
Mr. Speaker, I again thank Mrs.
MALONEY for her leadership through
the years to ensure that, in so many
ways, our first responders, families,
victims are all being fought for suc-
cessfully in the Halls of this great
Chamber, and all of our colleagues on
both sides of the aisle who have as-
sisted Mrs. MALONEY in her important
efforts. I thank the gentlewoman for
hosting today’s Special Order hour.
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr.
GOTTHEIMER), a great partner in our ef-
forts to rebuild after 9/11.
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I
thank Congresswoman MALONEY and
Chairman NADLER for hosting this bi-
partisan Special Order hour this
evening to remember the attacks on
September 11, 2001.
I thank the gentlewoman so much for
all she does for our first responders and
for our country. We are all very grate-
ful.
More than 700 New Jersey residents
were among the nearly 3,000 Americans
killed at the World Trade Center, the
Pentagon, and on the four planes that
morning. The attacks were not only a
declaration of war on the American
people, but also on our fundamental
ideals of freedom and liberty.
On 9/11, we lost more than 400 fire-
fighters, police, EMTs, and other first
responders who all ran in to help, true
patriots putting others ahead of them-
selves.
And since that tragic morning, 2,000
first responders who were there at the
pile in the days, weeks, and months fol-
lowing have died from illnesses from
their exposure to toxic dust and debris.
Earlier this year, I was proud to
stand right here on the House floor
alongside my colleagues in the New
York and New Jersey delegations, led
by Mrs. MALONEY and Mr. KING and
Chairman NADLER, calling for the per-
manent authorization of the 9/11 Vic-
tim Compensation Fund, which,
through the tireless advocacy efforts of
their fellow first responders and sur-
vivors will provide our sick and dying
9/11 first responders and their families
with the support they need and de-
serve.
Just as we stood together then—not
as Democrats or Republicans, but as
Americans—after those attacks 18
years ago, we must continue to do so
today and come together as a country
for our children, for our first respond-
ers, for our brave men and women in
Active Duty, and for our veterans.
I think our country has had enough
of the fighting. I think people want us
to come together as one. They want us
to work together, govern together, and
solve problems together under the flag.
Today, we are able to step back, to
think and reflect and pray for all the
lives we lost that day and all those we
have lost since. We honor their legacies
by coming together as a nation here in
the greatest country in the world and
continuing to work to build a more
perfect Union.
As we remember those we lost and
our veterans and our active service-
members and all of our first responders
who continue to protect us, may God
bless all those we lost that day as well
as their families, those we have lost
since, and may God bless those who
bravely protect us here at home and
abroad every day. And may God to con-
tinue to bless the United States of
America.
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. DELGADO),
an outstanding new Member of Con-
gress, a great addition to the New York
delegation.
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in honor of nearly 3,000 Ameri-
cans who were killed in the September
11 terrorist attacks on our homeland.
Eighteen years ago today, vile acts of
terror were committed in New York,
Virginia, and Pennsylvania. In the mo-
ments following these tragedies, as
thousands of people streamed out of
the towers for safety, thousands of first
responders ran into harm’s way to save
lives. These first responders came from
all across the State of New York, in-
cluding my district, the 19th Congres-
sional District.
Today is a solemn day of quiet re-
membrance. We bow our heads as a na-
tion in a moment of silence, as we can-
not carry the weight of these memories
of loved ones alone. The pain is too
hard for one family to bear, for one
city to bear alone, for one State to
bear alone.
b 1815
Today I join my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle, and from every cor-
ner of the country to never forget—to
never forget the lives we lost, to never
forget the sacrifices made of our men
and women in uniform, and know that
we will stand with you and your fami-
lies in the years ahead.
May we also never forget the na-
tional unity we all felt in the days,
weeks, and months following 9/11 where
all that mattered was putting country
first. God bless America.
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Mrs. NORMA
TORRES), a great leader here in Con-
gress.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I thank Representatives
MALONEY and NADLER for organizing
this Special Order to mark a day that
is engraved in the memory of every
American, September 11, 2001.
Eighteen years later we honor the
lives of the fallen, the firefighters and
the law enforcement officers who ran
towards danger when everyone else was
running away from it. And we recog-
nize the 911 dispatchers who were
working around the clock behind the
scenes to organize emergency response
across our Nation.
I was working at the LAPD 911 center
that morning. It was all hands on deck,
and I didn’t know when I would be able
to go home. My first assignment that
day was to assemble two mobile field
force units and send them out to pro-
tect places of worship, water treatment
plants, cell phone towers, and anything
that could be considered a target.
I had no idea what would come next.
None of us did. But like every first re-
sponder working that day, 911 dis-
patchers had to cast their own fears
aside. They had jobs to do. They had to
protect and secure their communities,
just like firefighters and police offi-
cers. And they had to be the calm reas-
suring voice on the other side of the
line for every person who dialed 911, for
every resident who was fearing the
worst, for every child who was calling
to ask should I go to school or stay
home. We received calls from all over
the world at our 911 center that day.
So as we pause today to remember
that tragic, dark day, let us not forget
the unsung heroes, the 911 dispatchers
who are always heard and never seen.
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Con-
gressional Progressive Caucus for al-
lowing us to use their time on the floor
with this Special Order remembering
our losses, our strength, remembering
9/11.
9/11 was a transformational event. I
never meet anyone from another coun-
try or any State in America that they
do not tell me about their feelings
about 9/11. I remember when I drove
home that day and my daughter was
home sick, and she said—and it still is
one of the best descriptions of what
happened—she said, ‘‘I feel like Alice
in Wonderland. I have gone through the
looking glass and nothing will ever be
the same again.’’ And it is true about
our country.
We reordered our priorities and made
Homeland Security our number one
priority. We wrote many bills to make
this country safer and stronger, and we
worked together that day and every
day. We remember the lives that were
taken from us and in the years that
have followed the lives that have been
lost because of sickness, and we are re-
minded of the strength and resiliency
of our great Nation and what we can
achieve when we band together.
I want to thank all of my colleagues
from both sides of the aisle for joining
me in this Special Order and for all of

their help and support and ideas, lead-
ership, and guidance to help rebuild
this Nation and make it stronger after
9/11.
We will never forget.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
f
REMEMBERING 9/11
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT) is recognized
for 60 minutes as the designee of the
minority leader.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I
thank Representative MALONEY for
telling the story. You know, it is not
just New Yorkers, I can’t imagine
there is an American who doesn’t re-
member exactly where they were in
that horrific moment. And it’s a mo-
ment yet where those of us in the West
and all over the country ached to see
what happened to your community.
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Will the gentleman yield?
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. I yield to the
gentlewoman from New York.
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman and all of my colleagues for all
of the support and the effort to rebuild
and make this country stronger. We
literally rewrote the whole intelligence
system and defense system of the Na-
tion and took really massive steps to
restructure our government and our
country to be able to respond and pro-
tect our citizens. It was a unified, de-
termined effort.
I thank all of my colleagues for all of
their help for New York and for all of
their help for the Pentagon and
Shanksville, and, mostly, for being
part of an effort to rebuild and make
this country stronger to be able to pre-
vent future attacks.
I thank Members so much for their
kind words. My constituents in my city
deeply appreciate it.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I
thank Representative MALONEY. We al-
ways have to be careful when we are
friends not to go around calling each
other by our first names.
But I was not here at the time of 9/11,
I did not come for another decade. And
yet today, even with the young people
we have in our office that were just
children, I mean young children, and
you can still feel that sort of somber
tone. It is a powerful example and
something that is devastating. And we
can come together. I desperately wish
there were more opportunities where
we remember, not the horror, but the
fact that there was unity. And how do
we deal in a world right now where so
much of our politics is toxic and in not
allowing that broken sort of political
system to ever sort of be more powerful
than those moments where we must
come together and both heal, deal with
the heartbreak and then also make
sure it never ever happens again.
So my reason for being on the floor
this evening is I wanted to spend a mo-
ment and just touch on 9/11 and how
that just affects so many of us. I am
told now in Arizona we have 30 or 40 of
those first responders or others who
were affected who are receiving their
healthcare in our community. I know
of only one or two Arizonans, I believe,
who lost their lives, so we always sort
of pull back to our communities and
personalize it.
THE MATH DOESN’T WORK
Mr. SCHWEICHERT. Mr. Speaker,
just before we got back there was a
jobs report, and I know that it is going
to be a little geeky, but I wanted to go
walk through some of those underlying
numbers that lay in there. And it’s ac-
tually good news, the fact that there
are really terrific things happening in
our economy.
But I still want to put it in context:
I have been coming to this microphone
for quite a while now to say, What is
the biggest issue we as a society have?
If you think of my little girl that is
going to turn 4 next month, what is the
biggest impairment to her economic
future? And we are going to walk
through some of the math, but we are
going to also walk through some of the
solutions, because it turns out it is de-
mographics.
We always put up this slide to basi-
cally sort of point out that the days of
yesteryear, where Members would get
behind these microphones and say,
Well, if we just raise the tax on this
population, or if we just do this entitle-
ment reform over here, or we just do
premium support over here that the
fact of the matter is that 30 years from
now, if you remove Social Security and
Medicare from the budget, this country
is 20-some-trillion dollars cash posi-
tive. If you pull Social Security and
Medicare back into the math, we are
$100 trillion upside down. Mathemati-
cally, we just can’t get there.
And so, if we actually care about
keeping our promises to those, you
know, the 10,300 Americans that turn 65
every single day and start to move into
their benefits, we really need to get se-
rious, because we are already in a
time—we don’t tell the public this be-
cause it is hard. We are not honest, I
believe, with ourselves, but there is al-
ready things Congress would des-
perately like to be doing, our constitu-
ents would desperately like us to do
that we are not doing because of the
squeeze-out factor that is already hap-
pening because of our demographics.
There is this thing called baby
boomers. I am one of them. And the
math to keep our promises basically
takes away the resources that would be
doing other things. And they are prom-
ises, we have to keep them.
So how do you create the economic
vitality, the labor force and all those
other things? And we are going to
spend a little bit of time on labor force
today.
So just some points of reference.
Every 5 years just the growth of Social
Security and Medicare healthcare enti-
tlements, just the growth portion
equals the entire Defense Department.
So if you came into the office and said,
‘‘DAVID, tomorrow my solution for
being able to keep our promises in
Medicare is let’s just get rid of the
Pentagon,’’ you only covered the
growth portion of the spending for So-
cial Security and Medicare healthcare
entitlements for 5 years. So then every
10 years, two full Pentagons is just the
growth. Ninety-one percent of the
spending increases that are basically
slated for the next 10 years are solely
the growth in Social Security and
Medicare.
Understand, it is math. It is not Re-
publican or Democrat. And we have lu-
nacy around here. We have done this on
the floor before, where we walk
through some of the solutions that are
thrown out that are completely make-
believe. Well, if we just raised taxes on
the rich and do this, if we just raised
this number, and you understand, the
math doesn’t work. You are going to
have to do something that is really
hard for a broken political system. And
we are going to have to do something
that is big, complex, and actually ho-
listic.
So one of the reasons we put this
board up almost every time we are be-
hind this microphone is trying to say,
We actually sort of have come up with
about five pillars, everything from, you
know, one pillar being tax policy, trade
policy, regulatory policy to maximize
economic velocity, incentives to be in
the labor force to maximize that, be-
cause labor force participation is cru-
cial.
Let’s explain. After tax reform, the
modelers kept coming back and saying,
We believe the headwinds for the eco-
nomic growth are going to be what
they call capital stock, savings. Will
the country have cash in its banks and
those things?
Well, we have already blown the
wheels off or the charts off or however
you want to say it in everything from
repatriated cash coming back into the
country which has been substantially
greater than we have ever expected.
Foreign investments. But also, Ameri-
cans have been saving substantially
more of the tax reform savings to them
than we actually modelled.
But it was labor force. And we are
going to come back to that because
there is actually some really inter-
esting, good news, but we have got to
get our heads around it, but the two
headwinds were labor force and capital
stock.
b 1830
We have proven capital stock is
working in our favor, and all of a sud-
den, we got a jobs report that looks
like the labor force. This violates all
the smart people and the demographers
who never thought that, at this point
in our demographic cycle, we would be
hitting these numbers.
Another thing we talk about is, how
do we have population stability? Immi-
gration, family formation. Our birth

rates, now we are at functionally nega-
tive population growth if we look at
domestic birth rates. That is a real
problem. If we are going to redesign
immigration, can we move to a talent-
based immigration system so it maxi-
mizes economic velocity?
Once again, you see a theme here. We
must grow like crazy.
Other things: Can we put incentives
into our earned entitlement programs?
When you earn your Social Security,
you earn your Medicare, could we build
some incentives in there saying, if you
are healthy and feel of sharp mind, or
if you want to be an entrepreneur,
what can we do as incentives to stay in
the labor force, to continue that, be-
cause we need you?
We have done some time on the floor
where we have walked through things
that are happening in countries like
Japan, where they are desperately try-
ing to get populations to stay or come
back into the labor force just for eco-
nomic survival.
The one we have had the most fun
with behind this microphone—and the
next slide will make some sense, and
then we will go on to the labor force
issues—is that I believe we are in a
time when technology may be one of
the things that saves us. We have done
time on this floor where we have
walked through amazing technology
that is about to do stunningly great
things for the environment.
We now have a couple of big experi-
mental power plants that are working
outside of Houston where they are
burning coal and natural gas with no
smokestack. They are collecting every
bit of the CO2.
We have proven that technology
works. Now we have had a break-
through on being able to carbon mine
the air. We have learned how to do a
couple things. There is a type of ge-
netic engineering in certain food
stocks so your cow doesn’t produce as
much methane. Remember, twice as
much comes out of the mouth as—a bit
of trivia.
It turns out, instead of just regu-
lating and controlling and crushing the
very economic growth we must have to
be able to keep our social entitlement
promises, let’s embrace technology.
There is technology that is about to
be a disruption in healthcare costs. Our
problem is that we have to legalize it.
Are you prepared to allow technology
to write you a prescription if we can
demonstrate that the algorithms and
the sensors and those things are in-
credibly accurate? Are we prepared to
work out some financing mechanisms
for these new biological drugs that are
about to cure diseases that are crush-
ing to both individuals and families but
also to the economics of healthcare?
Remember, 5 percent of our brothers
and sisters who have chronic condi-
tions are the majority of our
healthcare expenditures.
Where is the excitement and opti-
mism that there are a number of these
horrible, horrible afflictions that are
about to be cured?
I have been up here and brought the
charts and those things about diseases
like hemophilia. The fact is that we be-
lieve we are heading to a single-shot
cure. The 8,600—I believe that is the ac-
curate number—of our brothers and
sisters who suffer hemophilia, which is
a horribly expensive disease, can be
cured, but the drug is also really ex-
pensive. For instance, are we prepared
to think through how we finance cures,
a drug that stabilizes ALS but is going
to be really expensive?
What happens when I can use tech-
nology on one end to keep us healthy
and technology on the other end to
cure?
This has to be a radically different
way to think about how we are going
to crush the price of healthcare than
the insanity, the mathematical insan-
ity, that seems to be part of our public
discourse right now of, ‘‘Well, let’s just
nationalize healthcare,’’ because that
removes no costs. If you lay it out and
look at the underlying math, it doesn’t
save anything. It is just, once again,
playing the game of shifting.
Shifting things, like the debate we
have had for the last 10 years between
Republicans and Democrats on who
gets subsidized, who has to pay, who
should pay, and who gets subsidized, it
is absurdity.
We now need to do those things that
reduce the price or cure our brothers
and sisters who have these afflictions.
As we are walking through the math,
and we went back and double-vetted
this a couple of hours ago, and we
talked about this before, if you look at
the next 30 years and remove Social Se-
curity and Medicare, our country is
$23.1 trillion cash positive. If you take
Social Security, Medicare, and their
associated interest costs on the bor-
rowing, we are over $100 trillion nega-
tive.
If you look carefully, it is not Social
Security. Social Security is a big deal,
but two-thirds-plus of it is Medicare.
We need to have a fixation on what
we do as a society to crack the cost of
healthcare. That is why we are work-
ing on a piece of legislation in our of-
fice to allow technology to be truly—
think about a Blockbuster video mo-
ment.
How many of us went to Blockbuster
video last weekend? I know it is a silly
example, but it is a good one because
didn’t it feel like, overnight, we used to
go get those little silver disks, and now
we go home and hit a button?
We, as a society, engage in tech-
nology disruption all the time.
The problem with healthcare, similar
to what we have in education, is that
we have so much government intrusion
in it, so much government regulation,
so much trying to keep people safe.
The ability to have technology innova-
tion that crashes the price—we have all
seen some of the new wearables and
some of the things you can blow into
that look like they are going to diag-
nose everything from several types of
cancer to being able to tell if you have
the flu. The algorithms associated with
that, if we can demonstrate they are
highly accurate, what should they be
allowed to do?
That disruption is coming, but what
do we do about this? We know what is
driving the debt and what is going to
drive us off the rails.
Could I beg of us, as policymakers, to
fixate on the revolution that changes
this cost curve? Instead, we will do ab-
solutely ridiculous—my father used to
refer to it as the shiny object theory. It
is, you could have something that is in-
credibly important in your life, but if I
can come up with a shiny object over
here and wave it around and, in this
case, get the press and others and
maybe talk radio and maybe the cable
news, we will talk about the shiny ob-
ject. We will go run over and worry
about that and deal with that, even
though this over here is the thing that
is so critical to the survival of our soci-
ety.
Let’s talk about where we are having
some success right now.
It was only a couple years ago—I re-
member it was the Joint Economic
Committee—we were sitting down with
some demographers and researchers.
We were talking about the aging of
America and how labor force participa-
tion was going to crash. Because of
that, we were going to see a real
headwind in our ability to grow as a so-
ciety, as an economy.
Without growth, we are not going to
have the revenues. We are not going to
have all those pillars that we talked
about in the beginning moving forward.
Last Friday, we got the unemploy-
ment numbers. Underneath it, there is
that thing called the U6 data where
you start to dive into it and under-
stand what is really going on.
As we get ready to walk through
these really positive things, I need ev-
erybody to work with me on a concept.
How do we have a society—and let me
grab my little notes here—that, all of a
sudden, we have 163.4 million Ameri-
cans working? We are now back above
63 percent labor force participation. We
are back up to, like, 63.2, which those
very researchers in that meeting a cou-
ple of years ago said by now we would
be maybe as low as in the high 50s, that
the available labor was going to crash.
You start to understand that there is
a miracle happening in our society be-
cause, to quote some of the folks re-
cently, workers came out of the wood-
work this last month and have been en-
tering the labor force.
The best way I can describe this is,
remember a few years ago when we
used to come behind these microphones
and talk about the real unemployment
data: Hey, I know they are saying we
are only at 6 percent unemployment,
but if you add in all those people who
are not looking for work, discouraged
workers, if I can use a pop-culture term
from the 1980s, worn-out workers, the
unemployment rate was 14, 16, 18 per-
cent of the society.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7658 September 11, 2019
We have data that, last month, when
they do the real unemployment cal-
culation, it is the lowest it has been in
modern times. We are back at 7 percent
and ticking lower. The official unem-
ployment rate stayed at 3.7.
Work with me here. The official un-
employment rate doesn’t change, but
we know we had a few hundred thou-
sand new entries into the labor force. A
big chunk of that was not being cal-
culated in unemployment numbers be-
cause they weren’t even looking. Some-
thing happened in society where, all of
a sudden, folks who were under-
employed, who had not been looking,
all of a sudden came back.
This is really, really important. I
know it is geeky, but the math is abso-
lutely critical.
The other thing that was happening
was, if you dug into that unemploy-
ment report on Friday, if you take the
last 3 months, all of a sudden, wages
and productivity have started to spike.
If you analyze the last 3 months, all of
a sudden, wages are moving at about a
4.2 percent increase in a time with very
low inflation.
We all remember our econ classes.
What are the two things that make an
employer pay you more money? It was
really simple. It was productivity and
inflation.
What happens if we are in a world
where there is very little inflation and,
all of a sudden, we are paying people
more? It turns out maybe we have to
add a little labor force squeeze, a soci-
ety with more jobs than available
workers. All of a sudden, we get the
spike of productivity we see in the last
3 months. These are good things.
We have talked behind these micro-
phones for years now about how work-
ing men and women aren’t getting
ahead, that the actual real wages have
stayed flat for a couple of decades, ex-
cept for substantially this last year.
We really should figure out what are
we doing right and continue to do more
of it.
Look, it is math. Is it Republican
math or Democratic math? It is math,
but something is working in our soci-
ety where they are coming back into
the labor force.
Look, why isn’t there joy in this
place? Has our partisanship become so
dark that something that would be a
conversation of joy, a 3.3 percent un-
employment rate for adult women—
this is close to the 1953 rate, and in
1953, it was a dramatically smaller pop-
ulation that was looking.
How about a 5.5 percent African
American unemployment rate, a record
low? Where’s the joy? A 4.2 percent His-
panic American unemployment rate
has now tied the all-time record low. A
3.3 percent unemployment rate for
adult women, near the lowest rate
since 1953. A 2.8 percent Asian Amer-
ican unemployment rate, almost
touching up against the record low.
If you want to take prime age, which
there is a whole reason we calculate
that for productivity numbers, a 76.3
percent labor force participation, the
highest rate since February 2002, and
an 80 percent prime age, 25 to 54, em-
ployment rate for the first time since
2008.
There are other numbers in here.
b 1845
You would actually think for a mo-
ment there would be some level of joy
of something is working in our society,
where the very people we walk around
here claiming that we are fighting for
and that we care about is working. We
just need to figure out what is working
and do more of it.
U.S. household income finally
matches the 1999 peak, while the pov-
erty rate is at its lowest since 2001.
How many of you actually saw that
discussed over this weekend and over
the last couple of days?
It is working. For the first time,
most new working age hires in the U.S.
are people of color. It is working.
When I get up behind this mike and I
keep trying to say we have these five
pillars that we need all of these cyl-
inders to be clicking to be able to grow
the economy so we can generate the
revenues, so we actually have a fight-
ing chance to keep our promises, that
labor force participation one is work-
ing right now.
Doesn’t this body understand how
powerful this is?
They will be out tomorrow, and it is
always dangerous to guess, but last
month you saw the reality of what we
call receipts, tax receipts. Tax receipts
so far this year are functionally 3.1 per-
cent higher. They have grown. They
are the highest in U.S. history. And if
you actually use even what they call
inflation adjusted dollars, it is the sec-
ond highest in history.
So the misinformation campaign say-
ing, well, tax reform didn’t—no, tax re-
form is working. The revenue receipts
are up.
If we could actually get some decent
data on understanding social needs, So-
cial Security and disability, we know
the numbers have fallen. TANF needs
have fallen. Many of these are no
longer needing the U.S. Government
subsidies, our taxpayer dollars, because
they are working again.
Where is the joy? Yet why is the
spending functionally up about 61⁄2 per-
cent?
Well, a big portion of that was dis-
placed on what we call discretionary,
but a big portion of that growth is de-
mographics. We don’t do a particularly
honest job of showing in a chart say-
ing, look, this is on autopilot.
Every day, 10,300 Americans turn 65,
they move into benefits, and we have
set aside not nearly enough resources
to cover that. As a matter of fact, the
Medicare part A portion of the trust
fund is gone in a couple of years.
So as we walk through this—and this
chart is almost impossible to read and
understand, but the trendline of Afri-
can American women, of Hispanics, of
White workers, of African American
men, of Hispanics and others coming
back into the labor force is a miracle.
It is a demonstration of our five-pillar
proposal of how we grow, how we deal
with those healthcare costs that are
the driver of the crushing debt that is
coming down upon us not tomorrow,
but today.
One of the pillars is actually working
right now. We have demonstrated that
sort of holistic theory that, when you
get tax policy right, regulatory policy
right—could you imagine, when we fi-
nally get ourselves and some of the
trade issues all cleaned up, where we
can go economically?
But it is a demonstration that, eco-
nomically, this affects what is hap-
pening over here on people’s ability to
have the honor of work.
Mr. Speaker, I just desperately wish,
when we have our debates—I know we
are always going to have those mo-
ments where we have to do the shiny
object because that is great politics,
but the demographics and over $100
trillion of debt being handed to my lit-
tle girl over the next three decades is a
level of cruelty.
And it is not Republican or Demo-
crat, it is math, could we ever get our
heads around the fact of doing those
things that remove that cruelty and
make the next three decades for my lit-
tle girl, for all of us, one of the most
amazing portions of American history.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members may
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the topic
of this Special Order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Kansas?
There was no objection.
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, throughout
our district work period, I visited
farms, ranches, manufacturing plants,
and small businesses where people all
said the same thing: It is time to pass
the USMCA now. Farmers, ranchers,
and workers in Kansas understand how
important this monumental trade deal
is, and they want it done now.
On November 30, 2018, the United
States, Mexico, and Canada signed a
monumental free and fair trade agree-
ment for our countries. Since then,
Mexico has made significant labor re-
forms and adopted the USMCA, while
Canada is not far behind.
Unfortunately, here at home, the
USMCA is stuck in purgatory. Con-
gress failed to bring the USMCA to a
vote over the summer, while some of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7659
September 11, 2019
my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle continue to slow walk and delay a
vote to ratify the USMCA.
While my colleagues may want to
deny, or at least delay, any victory for
President Trump, the only people hurt
by delaying the USMCA are hard-
working American farmers, ranchers,
manufacturers, and families.
Currently, more than 12 million
American jobs depend on trade with
Canada and Mexico. As is the case for
45 other States, Canada and Mexico are
Kansas’ top two trading partners,
worth $4.9 billion every year, while
supporting 110,000 jobs in my State
alone. This impact underscores just
how important the USMCA is for our
country.
According to the U.S. International
Trade Commission, the USMCA will
create 176,000 new jobs and increase
U.S. GDP by $68 billion. Exports to
USMCA partners will grow by $33.3 bil-
lion, and imports from the USMCA
partners will grow by $31.5 billion.
Overall, the update to NAFTA will
create jobs, boost wages, and open up
new markets for American agriculture
and manufacturing. It also sets unprec-
edented standards for areas like intel-
lectual property, small businesses, and
the environment.
This is a significant improvement
over NAFTA, which was actually bene-
ficial to my district in Kansas, espe-
cially for our farmers, ranchers, and
aerospace manufacturers. However, the
25-year-old NAFTA agreement was out-
dated and badly in need of reform and
modernization.
Consider that, when NAFTA was first
negotiated in 1992, Motorola cell
phones were carried around in a bag,
and just one in five households had a
home computer. Even fewer than that
could connect to a dial-up internet in
order to access the world wide web,
which had just been unveiled in 1991.
Clearly, a lot has changed in the last
25 years, and our laws and trade deals
should change as well.
As Representative of the Air Capital
of the World and the breadbasket of
America, I know that USMCA is crit-
ical for manufacturers, farmers, and
ranchers throughout Kansas and our
country. That is why I am proud to
serve today on the whip team, led by
Whip STEVE SCALISE, to help get the
USMCA finalized in Congress.
Earlier today, our team met with
Ambassador Lighthizer to receive an
update on negotiations, and I want to
take a moment to again thank him and
the entire administration for the work
they did to draft the USMCA. Now it is
time for Congress to do its part to se-
cure this free and fair trade deal that
farmers, ranchers, workers, and fami-
lies in the heartland and throughout
the country deserve.
As a fierce advocate for free and fair
trade, I believe a trade agreement with
Canada and Mexico is crucial for Kan-
sas and our country. However, Presi-
dent Trump is right to insist that trade
deals both be fair and free.
Free trade allows us to export our
quality agriculture and manufactured
goods around the globe, while fair
trade enables us to do so at a fair price
without intellectual property infringe-
ment. The USMCA accomplishes both
of these goals.
I have several Members here with me
tonight who also want to talk. I want
to talk some more about some of the
other benefits that are out there from
the USMCA, but right now, Mr. Speak-
er, I yield to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. PERRY), my friend and
colleague.
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the good gentleman for bringing this
issue to light and for holding this Spe-
cial Order, and, of course, my col-
leagues who are with me here today.
All of us who are probably older than
the age of 25 have watched, probably in
every State in the Union, certainly in
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
every little town that you drove
through in the State that I am privi-
leged to represent, every little town
had some small business, or maybe two
or three: a shoe factory, a dress fac-
tory. One of the little towns south of us
had a cigar factory or two.
Over the course of my adult lifetime,
those little factories, those small em-
ployers in every single town have left.
The reason they left is multiple, but
one of them is because the trade deals
that were signed by previous adminis-
trations encouraged them to leave.
They encouraged our competitors to
take them over, and we closed up shop.
We lost those jobs. Our folks in Amer-
ica had to go find work elsewhere and
get retraining elsewhere.
It has been 25 years since NAFTA was
enacted. Twenty-five years is a long
time. Things were different 25 years
ago. There wasn’t e-commerce. We
weren’t all thinking about a globalized
economy.
Now these antiquated laws that we
are living under are holding back our
American economy. If we would just
pass the USMCA—it is in the hands of
the Speaker right now. If we would just
pass it, 176,000 new jobs, $68 billion in
growth to our economy.
Instead of being worried about trad-
ing with China and being concerned
with what China is going to do, we
could trade with people we really agree
with who are right on the other side of
our border: Canada and Mexico.
Wouldn’t that be wonderful?
We need to modernize our laws, and
that starts by allowing the USMCA to
go through. That framework should be
considered today. We need free and fair
trade. We don’t have that right now.
We must pass the USMCA to bolster
quality, family-sustaining jobs in
America, in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania and other States around
our country.
The USMCA is a win for the Amer-
ican worker. It is great to help out our
neighbors around the globe, but our re-
sponsibility first is right here at home
in our States, like the State of Penn-
sylvania where I am privileged to come
from.
The USMCA is a great start and a
strategic win. Today I am calling on
House leadership to allow for the con-
sideration of the USMCA without any
further delay. Let the chips fall where
they may. Put it on the floor, and let’s
see what happens. I suspect it will pass,
which means the will of the people will
be done and we can get to work work-
ing more with our allies and our
friends and doing better for Americans.
Quite honestly, while China is wait-
ing to make a trade deal, one of the
reasons they are waiting is because
this Congress won’t approve one in the
USMCA. They are saying: Why should
we come negotiate with America when
their Congress won’t approve what we
negotiate?
We need to show them that we will
approve it; we do stand with the Amer-
ican people and the American worker.
We need a better deal with China, too,
and it starts with the USMCA.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman
for allowing me the time and for bring-
ing this issue to the forefront.
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, Mr. PERRY
said a lot of things that are really valid
there and important to us.
I have several other Members who
want to talk about how important
things are. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. BALDERSON),
my friend and colleague.
Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to urge this body’s consideration
of the United States-Mexico-Canada
Agreement, or the USMCA, which has
the support of both of our neighboring
nations; the majority of our Nation’s
Governors, including Ohio’s Governor
Mike DeWine; more than 600 trade
group organizations across the Nation;
our current administration; a signifi-
cant number of my colleagues both in
the U.S. House of Representatives and
the U.S. Senate; and myself.
The USMCA will support tens of mil-
lions of jobs across the United States.
In my home State of Ohio, more than
428,000 jobs are supported by trade with
Canada and Mexico.
The livelihood of my constituents is
directly impacted by the success of
trade with our neighboring nations.
Last year, nearly $28 billion worth of
goods and services were exported from
my home State of Ohio to Canada and
Mexico.
b 1900
These exports consist of iron, steel,
motor vehicle parts, and machinery,
much of which come from my district
in central Ohio.
Ohio is also the 12th largest agricul-
tural exporting State. USMCA will
make important improvements to se-
cure greater market access for our
farmers and will ensure the fair treat-
ment of Ohio’s agriculture products in
the marketplace.
With $28 billion in economic value
and 428,000 Ohio jobs on the line, we
simply cannot afford for the USMCA to
fail. It is time to pass USMCA now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7660 September 11, 2019
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate Representative BALDERSON’s ef-
forts and involvement in this.
I yield to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN), my colleague.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I
would like to thank the gentleman
from Kansas for yielding.
I also rise today to speak urging con-
sideration of USMCA.
Mr. Speaker, I have been an elected
official for a while, and even when I
first began this job in the 1990s, I would
get complaints from people as to why
we couldn’t do something about
NAFTA.
After four Presidents, we watched
NAFTA be approved and watched jobs
leave America. We finally have a Presi-
dent who is willing to do something
about it. As mentioned before, this
agreement is important for Wisconsin
manufacturers and manufacturers all
over the country. Wisconsin, of all of
the States, has the second highest per-
cent of our workforce involved in man-
ufacturing, and that is why when I get
home, I hear about the importance of
this agreement so much.
But as important as it is to manufac-
turing, the major reason why I wish so
much this would be brought to the
floor is when I go back home, I hear so
much from my agriculture sector. This
is important for your corn farmer, but
it is even more important for your
dairy farmer. Dairy is in the worst po-
sition it has been, I think, since I was
in law school in the 1980s, and I was a
law clerk for someone who had a pri-
marily dairy clientele. It was so tough
watching what these guys and gals
went through in dairy in the 1980s.
Now, due to low prices, we are back
to where we again and again watch
dairy farmers wondering whether they
are going to be able to hang on for an-
other week, another month without
going under. And here we have this
agreement, which has been sitting here
waiting to be voted on, and we are not
allowed to come in here and vote on it.
I beg people. I realize that there may
be some things you don’t like about
President Trump, but he has nego-
tiated a very important agreement
here, a very important agreement for
manufacturers, a very important
agreement for the agriculture sector,
especially dairy.
Please, do not let this agreement
wait any more. Do not drive more peo-
ple out of business just for partisan
reasons. This is such a good agreement.
It is so rare that we get a big improve-
ment around here.
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman’s time and partici-
pation in this very important topic to-
night.
Now I yield to the gentleman from
Arizona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT), my friend.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I
thank my friend from Kansas who rep-
resents my wife’s family.
Hopefully, I won’t take a couple of
minutes, but there were a couple of
things as we were doing some economic
numbers before.
The modeling right now says if
USMCA passes, it is another half a
point on GDP growth. In a $21 trillion
economy, that is real money, but it is
also hundreds and hundreds of thou-
sands of jobs.
But there is even another complexity
that I am going to ask for folks to
think about. Think of the issues we
have, particularly with China. So many
of us would love to have a healthy rela-
tionship with China, but we don’t be-
lieve they are playing by the WTO
rules. They are breaking the rules.
So we are seeing a world right now
where lots of manufacturers are think-
ing about moving parts of their supply
chain. Wouldn’t it be an amazing thing
that we do our job here, we get this
trade agreement passed, and those
components, those issues, parts of
those supply chains are back here in
North America? Our ability to say our
continent, our trading block, our abil-
ity to not only have robust economies
for ourselves, but these labor provi-
sions.
And this is the last thing I really
wanted to hit on. The gentleman and I
are on the whip team for passing this.
We have had a number of visits with
our brothers and sisters on the left.
With a lot of them, I will get this: Well,
David, I am concerned about the en-
forcement of the new labor standards
that the Mexican Government has
passed.
Remember, their legislature has
passed this. Their President has signed
it. There are dramatic changes in their
labor rules. I will bring them a copy
and say: But you don’t understand, it is
not the 1940s and 1950s anymore. You
don’t send in a team of union rep-
resentatives to go inspect one of the
70,000-some facilities and inspect and
then write up a report saying we don’t
think you are—in today’s world, we
have that thing called the internet.
The law the Mexican Congress passed
actually has provisions in there for pri-
vacy and secrecy and the ability to use
technology that if you believe your
labor rights are being abused in a Mexi-
can factory, you can actually docu-
ment it. You can actually put it on a
blog and those things.
So how do we drag our brothers and
sisters from the left to actually walk
away from the excuse of the labor im-
provement enforcement, and get them
to understand that it is not the 1950s
anymore; that now we are going to use
technology and the ability to have
these new labor standards in Mexico
which can be enforced on a very large
scale using technology?
This is incredibly important to our
economic growth, and our entire re-
gions. Let’s get this done.
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentleman very much for his com-
ments. The gentleman pointed out so
much about how important it is to get
that economic growth so that we have
got the value in the economy and how
much effort that Mexico has made, al-
ready changing the laws in their coun-
try to make sure that it is a much
more viable process for them, and it is
more productive for them as well.
Mr. Speaker, I come from Kansas,
and specifically in my district, we have
a lot of agriculture and a lot of issues
there. And the USMCA is a great im-
provement for the agriculture area. It
sets some unprecedented standards for
agriculture, regulation, and bio-
technology.
It maintains duty-free access for
American farmers in Mexico, and pro-
vides new access for U.S. wheat, eggs,
dairy, and poultry. In fact, the Inter-
national Trade Commission estimates
an additional $277 million in increased
dairy sales to our North American
partners under USMCA. That is a 44
percent increase that will bring a
much-needed lift to the U.S. dairy in-
dustry.
Another area is manufacturing.
USMCA maintains a duty-free access
for U.S. manufactured goods and re-
moves some of the existing barriers for
remanufactured goods, opening up a lot
of new markets for American products.
It encourages U.S. manufacturing by
requiring 75 percent of auto content to
be produced in North America. The Of-
fice of the United States Trade Rep-
resentative estimates that USMCA will
add $34 billion in automotive invest-
ment and create 76,000 new American
jobs.
It also incentivizes higher wages, re-
quiring 40 to 50 percent of auto content
to be made by workers making at least
$16 an hour, helping to boost wages
across many manufacturing sectors.
It requires Mexico to pass some
sweeping labor reforms to improve
standards there and create an even
more even playing field for American
labor. Mexico has already followed
through and enacted these reforms
which are already benefiting U.S. man-
ufacturing.
Canada and Mexico buy more prod-
ucts manufactured in America than
our next 10 trading partners. Exports of
manufactured goods to Canada and
Mexico account for more than 2 million
jobs across our country.
As a representative of Wichita, I have
seen firsthand how important it is that
our manufacturers have access to glob-
al markets. Transportation equipment
exports account for $2.7 billion last
year, and the growth in manufactured
goods, exports from Kansas, grew 8.5
percent from 2010 to 2018.
In addition, Kansas aerospace exports
to Canada and Mexico have increased
by more than 20 percent over the last
decade, helping grow the total value of
manufactured goods exported from
Kansas to Canada and Mexico to $3.2
billion in 2018. These numbers under-
score the importance of USMCA for
American manufacturing.
I wanted to mention that I have got
some other representatives here who
also have a big impact and a lot of
value to add to that. Right now I would
like to call on my friend and colleague
from Pennsylvania.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7661
September 11, 2019
I yield to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. KELLER).
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman from Kansas yield-
ing to me.
I stand before you today representing
the outstanding people of Pennsylva-
nia’s 12th Congressional District to call
upon the Speaker to bring up and my
colleagues to pass the United States-
Mexico-Canada Agreement, otherwise
known as USMCA.
Back in Pennsylvania’s 12th Congres-
sional District during the August work
month, I heard from our farmers our
manufacturers, and energy producers,
all of whom would benefit from the
passage of the USMCA.
Their message to me was clear: We
need to complete this trade deal so we
can continue hiring, growing wages,
and keep this economy rolling. The
benefits of the USMCA to our agri-
culture community are critical.
Pennsylvania’s 12th Congressional
District is home to over 10,500 farms, 98
percent of which are family farms.
Moreover, our district is responsible
for 18 percent of Pennsylvania’s agri-
cultural sales.
During August, I visited Brown Hill
Farms in Tunkhannock. I met with
dairy producers at an ag-dairy summit
with USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue
and my colleague, Congressman G.T.
THOMPSON.
I also attended Penn State’s AG
Progress Days, Pennsylvania’s largest
outdoor agricultural exposition. At
each visit, dairy producers said the
same thing. The USMCA agreement
would greatly benefit them by elimi-
nating Canada’s Class 7 milk, allowing
American dairy farmers to once again
sell milk ingredient products in Can-
ada.
Canada and Mexico have taken steps
to finalize this agreement. What is
stopping the United States from doing
the same? Right now, the agreement is
sitting on Speaker PELOSI’s desk.
Let’s be clear. Failure to bring up the
USMCA for a vote is a failure to stand
up for American jobs, American work-
ers, and American families.
That is a shame because one thing
that Members of Congress share is that
we want to do what is best for our dis-
tricts and for our country. Our con-
stituents sent us here to work on
things that will actually help people.
USMCA will do that by prioritizing
American jobs, American goods, and
American workers.
I thank Congressman ESTES for orga-
nizing tonight’s Special Order on
USMCA. Let’s work on things that can
actually help people. Let’s work on
things that can have a positive impact.
Let’s pass the USMCA.
Mr. Speaker, let’s get this done.
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman’s time and in-
volvement in this.
I would also now like to call on a
friend of mine and colleague from the
great State of Indiana.
I yield to the gentleman from Indi-
ana (Mr. BAIRD).
Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I would
like to thank my colleague from Kan-
sas for allowing me to have the oppor-
tunity to speak on this important
issue.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to lend my
voice in support of the United States-
Mexico-Canada Agreement, better
known as USMCA, which will expand
markets for our farmers and manufac-
turers, while ensuring cheaper goods
for Americans.
In Indiana, our economy thrives be-
cause we are one of the larger manufac-
turing States in the country, and an
agricultural center for the Nation. We
make the steel that towers above the
Nation’s largest cities in skyscrapers.
We build the cars that drive along the
Nation’s highways and byways, and we
grow the crops that feed the Nation’s
citizens and livestock.
We have built this economy, in part,
through strong international relation-
ships with countries as far away as
Japan, and as close as Canada and Mex-
ico. In fact, it is the partnerships with
our closest neighbors to the north and
south that are the strongest and most
vital.
In 2018, Canada was the Hoosier
State’s most significant international
export market, purchasing 34 percent
of all of the exports, for a total of $13
billion in products. The 72 Canadian
companies which operate in Indiana
employ over 15,600 citizens of our
State.
Mexico follows as our second biggest
export market, purchasing 13.8 percent
of our exports, injecting $5.5 billion
into the Hoosier heartland. There are
2,000 manufacturing firms and 61,000
jobs in Indiana who rely on exports to
these countries.
Beyond the strengthening of our ex-
port market, USMCA will also increase
the percentage of cars that must be
built in North America to 75 percent
and require that 40 percent of the auto
content be built by workers earning $16
an hour or more.
This is both a boon for manufactur-
ers in the State and the Hoosier work-
ers that are the lifeblood of our
economy.
b 1915
This legislation also opens up Cana-
dian markets to our U.S. turkey and
dairy products and ensures that our ag-
ricultural producers have access to
Mexico’s markets tariff-free.
Right now, due to the international
trade conditions like the current delay
in this deal, Hoosier manufacturers are
seeing their growth stymied. The Hoo-
sier farmers are hurting as corn, soy,
and pork markets have taken major
hits in the past few years. The longer
we wait, the worse it gets.
Nearly every day I hear from con-
stituents who are anxious to get this
trade deal passed so that we can keep
our economy in high gear. Our farmers
and manufacturers in the Fourth Dis-
trict need this deal for both the cer-
tainty and the prosperity it will pro-
vide.
USMCA will further expand pros-
perity and ensure that the strong eco-
nomic growth we have seen in the past
3 years continues.
Mr. Speaker, I will close with this:
Allow us to vote.
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I yield to
the gentleman from Florida (Mr.
STEUBE), who is my friend and col-
league.
Mr. STEUBE. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, Florida, which I have
the privilege of representing, relies on
trade with Canada and Mexico to sur-
vive and thrive. From transportation
equipment to machinery to agricul-
tural products, in 2017 alone, Florida
exported $6.7 billion in goods to Canada
and Mexico.
We are not alone. Canada was the
leading market for United States goods
exported, followed closely by Mexico in
2017. These allies account for 34 percent
of U.S. exports and 35 percent of U.S.
imports. They are our strategic part-
ners and an important part of our suc-
cessful economy here in the United
States.
Continuing the long history of our
successful trade relationship is essen-
tial to bringing the United States econ-
omy into the 21st century. That is why
Congress should pass the USMCA. By
implementing the USMCA, we would be
creating 176,000 additional American
jobs and continuing to grow our econ-
omy by over $68 billion.
This agreement will protect Amer-
ican intellectual property, update our
digital trade rules, enable data to be
transferred cross-border, and expand
markets for American agricultural
products. USMCA maintains the suc-
cessful duty-free access for American
farmers in Mexico and opens the Cana-
dian market up for the first time to
American dairy, wheat, chicken, egg,
and turkey products. American dairy
producers alone would grow their ac-
cess to up to 3.59 percent of the Cana-
dian dairy market, and the dairy farm-
ers in my district in the 17th District
of Florida can use every little bit of an
opportunity to sell their products.
Improving USMCA will ease the un-
certainty facing Florida farmers and
ranchers, allowing them to make new
investments to grow operations.
This deal is a good deal for Florida
and America, and it is time that the
majority bring this important measure
to the floor.
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I yield to
the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MAR-
SHALL). Representative ROGER MAR-
SHALL is my fellow Kansan and col-
league.
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I
thank so much the gentleman, my
friend and fellow colleague from Kan-
sas, for leading on this issue and giving
me the opportunity to speak about it.
Certainly, times are very tough in
agriculture, the toughest I have ever
seen, the toughest, certainly, since the
1980s. The passage of USMCA, the
NAFTA 2.0, is the single greatest thing

Congress could do for our farmers,
ranchers, manufacturers, and workers.
The President has delivered, and now
it is time for Congress to deliver. De-
laying the implementation of this pro-
gram hurts agriculture across Kansas
because the deal would enable Kansas
producers to trade more commodities
by opening the Canadian market up for
American dairy, wheat, chicken, and
eggs, some for the very first time.
Additionally, this agreement will
grow our business with our very top
two customers, Mexico and Canada,
meaning thousands of jobs and hun-
dreds of millions of dollars in increased
exports for Kansans.
Finally, the unprecedented standards
for agricultural biotechnology will sup-
port 21st-century innovations in agri-
culture and lay the groundwork for fu-
ture agreements with other countries
around the globe.
Some of the brightest thinkers in the
world are in America, but these
innovators have been robbed of billions
of dollars over the previous decades due
to intellectual property theft. USMCA
can’t be delayed any longer, as new
protections for intellectual property
will drive innovation and create even
more jobs by strengthening protection
of patents, trademarks, and secrets.
President Trump’s USMCA also lev-
els the playing field for workers in my
State by expanding guarantees for the
enforcement of labor protections across
North America. Future economic
growth and jobs for Kansas and Amer-
ica are increasingly dependent on ex-
panding U.S. trade and investment op-
portunities in the global marketplace.
President Trump has delivered this in-
credibly bipartisan deal, and it is long
past time for Congress to bring it up
for a vote to usher in a new era in
American trade.
Mr. Speaker, it is now time for us to
bring USMCA to the floor.
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I thank all
the Members who have joined us to-
night.
As President Trump has often point-
ed out, many of our trade deals have
not always created the best outcomes
for American workers and products,
but by approving the USMCA, we can
take one giant step in overhauling one
of the most fundamental trade deals
with our closest neighbors. We can also
create a great template for success, es-
pecially if we turn our focus to improv-
ing trade relations with China and
other countries.
As we stated tonight, there is no
time like the present to get started
moving this process forward, making
sure that every provision of the deal is
enforceable so we can get the USMCA
across the finish line. The cost of delay
is too great for our farmers, ranchers,
manufacturers, small businesses, entre-
preneurs, and families.
Again, I thank my colleagues for
joining me tonight, and I ask this body
to pass the USMCA now.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, if innovation
is the lifeblood of our nation’s economy, then
the Dallas-Fort Worth region might very well
be considered our country’s heart. World-class
research hospitals and several leading phar-
maceutical companies call DFW home, where
they create life-saving treatments while keep-
ing our local economy strong. Their continued
success, however, depends on their access to
international marketplaces, especially those in
Canada and Mexico. That is why passing the
United States Mexico Canada Agreement, or
‘‘USMCA,’’ is so important.
One of the biggest concerns that I hear from
innovators in my district is the protection of
their intellectual property (IP) rights in the
international marketplace. President Trump
and Trade Ambassador Lighthizer have deliv-
ered on this issue by installing robust IP pro-
tections into this trade agreement with Canada
and Mexico. The USMCA provisions that
strengthen patents, copyrights, trademarks,
and trade secrets protections mean that
innovators can spend less time worrying about
protecting their IP rights and more time cre-
ating products and Texas jobs.
Not only will this job creation boost the
American and Texan economies, but it will
also benefit two of our country’s strongest
trading partners. In 2017, Texas alone ex-
ported $127 billion in products to Canada and
Mexico, with 72 percent of the materials im-
ported by Texan manufacturers coming from
those same countries. The Texas economy
flourishes from its trade relationship with these
countries, and in the end, trade with Mexico
and Canada supports 948,900 jobs in our
state.
Many Americans are already living in the
strongest economy of their lifetimes, and the
USMCA is critical to ensuring that our coun-
try’s industries can continue to prosper and
sell their goods freely and fairly across the
globe. I urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting its passage and ask that it be brought
up for a vote as soon as possible.

PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Eternal God, You are our defender
and hope. On this 18th anniversary of
September 11, we thank You that You
never give us burdens too great to bear.
Continue to remind us that eternal vig-
ilance is the price for freedom. Comfort
the families of those who died on 9/11,
surrounding them with Your mercy
and grace.
Lord, incline Your ears to our inter-
cession. Teach us how to embrace the
things that lead to peace, as You in-
struct us on how to fulfill Your pur-
poses on Earth. Today, use our law-
makers as instruments of reconcili-
ation.
We pray in Your merciful Name.
Amen.

REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11TH
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President,
the Chaplain opened our Senate in
prayer reminding everybody of what
happened 18 years ago today: a disas-
trous attack on the United States. So
referring to that same 18 years, I say
our Nation changed forever following
an act of cowardice from the enemies
of freedom. The events of September 11
have left an indelible mark on Amer-
ican and world history and certainly on
the lives of the victims’ families. We
pray now, as we did then, that God may
heal the wounds of those injured and
the wounds left by those lost that day,
that they may find peace on this sol-
emn day.
Let us recall the sacrifices made that
day to preserve our way of life and
honor each day the pledge ‘‘Never for-
get.’’
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.

f
E-CIGARETTES
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this
week there was a significant develop-
ment when it came to public health
and our children in America. By way of
preface to what I am about to say, I
want to make clear that I have, during
the course of my service in the House
and the Senate, focused a great deal of
my efforts on tobacco, the addiction
that people have to tobacco cigarettes,
and the deadly consequences of that
addiction. My family has been touched
by it, as most have in America. I lost
my father when I was in high school.
He smoked two packs a day and was a
lung cancer victim. We buried him at
the age of 53. I remember it to this day.
I am not alone. Literally, thousands
of Americans—millions, perhaps—have
a similar story to tell. So from the be-
ginning of my service in the House of
Representatives, I started looking for
ways to deal with this scourge of to-
bacco cigarette addiction. Many years
ago—over 25 years ago—I introduced a
measure that banned smoking on air-
planes, and to my great surprise it
managed to pass the House of Rep-
resentatives. Senator Frank Lauten-
berg of New Jersey was on the Appro-
priations subcommittee with the re-
sponsibility. He took it on in the Sen-
ate, passed it, and we made it the law
of the land, banning smoking in air-
planes.
I didn’t realize—and I am sure Sen-
ator Lautenberg didn’t—that we had
triggered a tipping point or reaction
that led to banning smoking in so
many other venues. Ultimately, we
have now reached a point where no one
would consider walking into my office
and lighting up a cigarette or even ask-
ing for permission to light a cigarette.
It is just unthinkable. But 25 years ago
it was common. So things have
changed.
But what has happened is that Big
Tobacco, having lost its marketplace
position and lost its profitability, has
moved to a new product—e-cigarettes
and vaping. This company, JUUL,
which is the largest provider of e-ciga-
rette devices in the United States, has
a huge stock ownership in tobacco
companies. This is their new venue,
their new approach. But much as with
tobacco cigarettes, the vaping industry
is counting on addicting children so
that they can build their ranks, addict-
ing teenagers. Tobacco cigarettes did
the same with Joe Camel and the Marl-
boro cowboy, and now we see the same
thing occurring when it comes to e-
cigarettes and vaping.
The previous Food and Drug Admin-
istration Commissioner, Dr. Gottlieb,
characterized it properly when he
called it an epidemic. We now have 3
percent of American adults who are
using vaping devices, 20 percent of
America’s teenagers and children using
vaping devices. It is a new school year,
and many of these students are heading
off to middle schools and high schools

with new backpacks and maybe new
laptops and new lockers and new teach-
ers and new classrooms and new friends
and a new addiction—the addiction of
vaping.
Vaping targets kids. They are intro-
ducing flavors that can be mixed with
this vaping experience that appeal di-
rectly to children and teenagers in this
country. How in the world can you
imagine that someone who is a 50-year-
old chain smoker trying to quit is
going to choose a flavor pod called
‘‘Unicorn Milk’’ or ‘‘Bubble Gum’’ or
‘‘Gummy Bears’’? They are all out
there. They are designed to lure chil-
dren, and, sadly, they are effective.
For months now I have been begging
this administration and the Food and
Drug Administration to do something
about this epidemic, and until this
week they did little or nothing. But
this week was a breakthrough. The
Food and Drug Administration an-
nounced early this week that they were
going to stop JUUL from advertising
that their vaping products were a safe
alternative to tobacco cigarettes.
The reason is obvious. We have hun-
dreds and hundreds of vaping victims
now showing up in hospitals. As of last
night, the sixth victim in America died
from a vaping experience. Why? Be-
cause they are ingesting into their
lungs, in these huge clouds of vapor
and smoke, chemicals that are killing
them, chemicals that are stopping
their lungs from functioning. They
don’t realize it at the time; it is just
another wild experience. They are told,
by the way, by JUUL and others that it
is safer than tobacco cigarettes. It is
not safe. It is deadly, and it is an epi-
demic in this country.
This week the American Medical As-
sociation stepped up its role, and I
want to commend them. Dr. Patrice
Harris, the President of the American
Medical Association, released the fol-
lowing this week:
In light of increasing reports of e-ciga-
rette-associated lung illnesses across the
country, the [American Medical Association]
urges the public to avoid the use of e-ciga-
rette products until health officials further
investigate and understand the cause of
these illnesses.
She goes on to say:
The e-cigarette-related lung illnesses cur-
rently sweeping across the country reaffirm
our belief that the use of e-cigarettes and
vaping is an urgent public health epidemic
that must be addressed. We must not stand
by while e-cigarettes continue to go unregu-
lated. We urge the U.S. Food and Drug Ad-
ministration to speed up the regulation of e-
cigarettes and remove all unregulated prod-
ucts from the market. We also call on the
FDA to immediately ban flavors, as well as
marketing practices, that enhance the ap-
peal of e-cigarette products to youth.
The Food and Drug Administration
Commissioner has the authority
today—before the sun sets on this 9/11
anniversary—to ban these flavor pods
that are attracting children and adding
to this epidemic in our high schools
and middle schools across the United
States. This Food and Drug Adminis-
tration Administrator, Dr. Ned
Sharpless, has the authority to take off
the market scores, if not hundreds, of
vaping devices that have been intro-
duced to the public after the official
date of deeming last year. He can do it
today. It would have a dramatic effect
starting tomorrow. He could start en-
forcing it with the retailers across
America if he cared and if he were seri-
ous.
Now we have an opportunity to test
him and to test this administration.
Will they go the next step in warning
America’s schools, teachers, families,
and children about this epidemic and
the deadly consequences of ignoring it?
Will they take these products off the
market this week?
That is my challenge to them and to
every American parent who dearly
loves their child and cares about their
health. I hope they will join me in this
effort to urge this administration to
take decisive action for children across
America.
I yield the floor.
f
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
f
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
with only a few weeks to go until the
end of September, we have no time to
waste when it comes to appropriations.
We had planned for the Senate to con-
sider bipartisan bills from the Appro-
priations Committee as soon as next
week and make significant headway
before a partial interim continuing res-
olution becomes necessary at the end
of the month.
To this end, Democrats and Repub-
licans in both the House and the Sen-
ate, plus President Trump, formalized
an agreement 1 month ago. It set up
funding levels to inform the appropria-
tions process, and everyone on both
sides agreed there would be no poison
pills, no partisan wrenches thrown into
the gears.
Unfortunately, yesterday brought
some disturbing signals that Demo-
crats may be rethinking that commit-
ment. New poison pills are apparently
being discussed. But everyone knows
what we agreed to last month. In fact,
back on August 1, I asked consent to
print the entire terms sheet that ev-
eryone agreed to in the RECORD.
So I maintain hope that Chairman
SHELBY and Ranking Member LEAHY
can oversee a smooth process and that
we can move all 12 appropriations bills
in a bipartisan fashion. Both sides have
every reason to want a smooth appro-
priations process to proceed as we had
planned. I hope that is exactly what
happens in committee this week and on
the floor soon thereafter.
f
TRIBUTE TO JOHN BOLTON
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on another matter, as he departs the
position of National Security Advisor,
I want to thank Ambassador John
Bolton for his many years of valuable
service to our country. Personally, I
have always appreciated John’s candor
and clear advice. He possesses some-
thing crucial—the ability to under-
stand the world the way it is. He knows
that there are many threats to Amer-
ican interests and that those threats
will not recede if we retreat. He under-
stands that American leadership is es-
sential to keeping these threats and
enemies at bay and that our partners
and allies rarely act without us.
John appreciates the need to stand
up to adversaries like Putin’s Russia,
to approach them from a position of
strength, and to hold them accountable
for their lies and their misdeeds.
I wish him well wherever his career
next takes him.
Of course, the President deserves to
choose his own team, and he has as-
sembled a strong one. He and our Na-
tion are well served by leaders such as
Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Esper,
and Director Haspel.
I hope the President selects a Na-
tional Security Advisor who will work
well with these seasoned national secu-
rity leaders who have been chosen by
the President and confirmed by the
Senate.
f
REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11TH
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on another entirely different matter,
for 18 years today’s date has held a
tragic meaning. September 11 is a day
of mourning, a date stained by the ter-
rorist murderers of so many innocent
people in New York, Arlington, and
Pennsylvania. With each passing day,
the reality is still shocking, and the
wounds are still painful.
Each year we remember the innocent
men, women, and children who lost
their lives: workers rushing to meet-
ings, vacationers headed home, emer-
gency personnel whose quick response
immortalized them as heroes. Each
year we honor the memories of the he-
roes who sacrificed their lives to bring
the perpetrators of this evil to justice
and to prevent similar attacks.
Our way of life was changed by 9/11.
It changed our approach to security. It
awakened us to determined new en-
emies.
The dangers of radical Islamic terror-
ists remain real. Al-Qaida, its enablers,
and its allies still plot against America
from Afghanistan and Pakistan to
Yemen, Somalia, Libya, Mali, and be-
yond. ISIS persists in Iraq and Syria
through an underground network of
terrorists who have not yet given up
the fight. We cannot walk away from
these dangers. We must not leave our
work undone.
Many nations have a stake in defeat-
ing the terrorists. NATO allies have
been with the United States since the
early hours of this fight. Eighteen
years ago, this critical alliance in-
voked article V for the first time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5415
September 11, 2019
Since then, many NATO partners have
fought side by side with us in Afghani-
stan, in Iraq, and in Syria.
We are not—and need not be—the
world’s policeman. Winning this long
war, like the Cold War, will require
sustained efforts and contributions not
only from the United States but from
our allies and especially from local
partners. For example, in Afghanistan
the vast majority of the fighting is
done by local security forces, but we
must always remember the global coa-
lition to defeat the terrorists will not
lead itself.
So, today, as we remember the trage-
dies of the past, we must renew our
commitment to leading the fight for a
better future. Today, may the memory
of the nearly 3,000 victims who lost
their lives on this day in 2001 serve as
a lasting reminder of what is at stake
in the fight against terrorism and steel
our resolve to continue the hard, nec-
essary work of defending our home-
land. May we always keep foremost in
our thoughts all the U.S. servicemem-
bers, intelligence officers, diplomats,
and first responders who have given
their lives in pursuit of our Nation’s
security.

REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11TH
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, 18
years ago today, on a cloudless Tues-
day morning, my city, our country, our
world changed forever. In the span of a
few hours, the Twin Towers fell, the
Pentagon was hit, and smoke rose from
an empty field in Pennsylvania. More
than 3,000 souls were taken from us
that day.
I knew some of them: a guy I played
basketball with in high school, a busi-
nessman who helped me on my way up,
a firefighter I did blood drives with. It
was one of the bloodiest days on Amer-
ican soil since the Civil War.
Each year, we pause to remember
that awful day. We mourn those we
lost, but we also recognize, in the
aftermath of September 11, the resil-
iency of the American people. The re-
siliency of New Yorkers shone through
one of the darkest hours in our coun-
try.
Looking back remains difficult even
after 18 years. I ride my bike through
the city of New York and every fifth or
sixth street is named after a firefighter
or a police officer who died, as are
parts of Brooklyn, Bay Ridge, and
places like that. I will never forget. I
think of it all the time.
The day after, when President Bush
sent Senator Clinton and me to go up
to New York in planes, we were the
only planes in the sky. We were in an
airliner that had us surrounded by F–
18s and F–16s. When we landed, we went
down to the site. The smell of death
and burnt flesh was in the air. This I
will never forget, a thousand people
lined up—no one knew who had lived
and who had died—with little signs:
Have you seen my mother, Mary? Have
you seen my son, Bill?
That stays with me.
I remember the generosity of New
Yorkers. A man who owned a shoe
store just north of the Towers gave out
free shoes to everybody who was flee-
ing. Many of them had lost their shoes
in the long trek down the stairs.
I remember the valor of the first re-
sponders who rushed to the Towers. I
remember a firefighter from Staten Is-
land, based in Brooklyn, who went to
his firehouse, put his full gear on, and
ran through the tunnel with about 60,
70 pounds of gear on. It was his day off,
but he knew he was called. He went up
the stairs of the World Trade Center
and was crushed when the Twin Towers
collapsed. So there is a lot.
Another way I think of this every
day, as I am sure you have noticed, is
that I always wear this flag on my
lapel. I called on Americans to wear
the flag the day after my having wit-
nessed the site, and I have worn this
flag every day since. Every time I look
at it, I think of those who were lost,
and I think of the valor of New Yorkers
and of the American people.
For the first responders, this 9/11 car-
ries additional significance. A few
months ago, some of the heroes that
day were here in Washington to cele-
brate the permanent reauthorization of
the Victim Compensation Fund. I
thank the first responders who came to
Washington and helped to secure this
funding, especially those who are no
longer with us—James Zadroga, Luis
Alvarez, my friend Ray Pfeifer. Wher-
ever they are, I hope they are looking
down with the knowledge that their
brothers and sisters are being taken
care of.
God bless those good heroes. May
God continue to bless this resilient Na-
tion.
Later this morning, I will return to
the floor with the Republican leader
and my colleagues as we will respect a
moment of silence in memory of Sep-
tember 11.
f
APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on a
different subject, I return this morning
to the topic of appropriations.
We have until the end of this work
period to figure out a way to continue
government funding, and there is good
talk of a short-term continuing resolu-
tion so the government doesn’t run out
of money on September 30. Yet the
larger question is how this Chamber is
going to proceed or not proceed with
the 12 appropriations bills that fund
our government.
Despite many disagreements between
the majority and minority in this
Chamber, the Senate has been able to
produce several bipartisan budget deals
even in the Trump era. The reason we
have been able to do this is that both
parties have been committed to work-
ing together throughout each stage of
the appropriations process. Bipartisan-
ship—appropriations can only work
with it and will not work without it.
Earlier this summer, the Democrats
and the Republicans negotiated the
broad outlines of a budget deal in good
faith. We allocated the 302(a)s and
came up with a side agreement. After
that, the very first step in the appro-
priations process is to agree, in a bipar-
tisan way, with the allocations for the
12 subcommittees of the Appropria-
tions Committee. That is what we did
in 2018, and I believe it passed the com-
mittee unanimously—or maybe with
one dissenting vote. It was passed
unanimously on a bipartisan basis. The
Appropriations Committee passed
those 302(b) allocations 31 to 0. That is
how we thought it was going to work
now, but already we are running into
trouble with those allocations this
time around.
The Republican majority on the Ap-
propriations Committee has unilater-
ally proposed putting in an additional
$12 billion for the President’s border
wall, taking away $5 billion of funding
for Health and Human Services—des-
perately needed programs like
healthcare and fighting opioid addic-
tion and cancer research—and putting
it into the wall. This is without our
OK, without our acknowledgment, and
without our acceptance. The Repub-
lican majority also reprogrammed
funding from other sources and
backfilled money the President pro-
poses to pilfer for military construc-
tion, which has affected, I believe, 30
States.
My Republican colleagues and my
friend the Republican leader know very
well this will not fly with Senate
Democrats. We are not going to vote
for a budget that is partisan and is at-
tempting to be jammed down our
throats. It puts an additional $12 bil-
lion into the wall? Forget that. So here

we are already—at step No. 1 in the ap-
propriations process—and the spirit of
bipartisanship that is necessary for
this work might be melting away.
I just warn my Republican colleagues
that this is not a way to produce a
budget. This is the same path they
tried to go down last year. They shut
down the government and then had to
walk it back. We all know what a par-
tisan process looks like. President
Trump caused the longest government
shutdown in American history by de-
manding funding for a border wall and
then by shutting down the government
when Congress didn’t give it to him.
Let’s not go down that exact path
again 9 months later.
There is still time to get the process
back on track. The Republican major-
ity should sit down with the Democrats
on the committee and, in good faith,
come up with the 302(b) allocations and
come up with the order by which we
bring bills to the floor. Then we can
get this done. We don’t have to go back
to a CR. Certainly, our side wants to
avoid a Republican shutdown, and we
hope our Republican colleagues will
have the good sense not to let Presi-
dent Trump lead them into that cul-de-
sac once again. So let’s sit down and
make this work. That is what we want
to do, not unilaterally declare some-
thing and say, ‘‘Take it or leave it,’’
but work together so both sides have to
give.
f
BACKGROUND CHECKS
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now,
on gun safety, in response to the scenes
of senseless violence in America
throughout the month of August, Lead-
er MCCONNELL promised that the issue
of gun safety would be ‘‘front and cen-
ter’’ when Congress returned. The
Democrats are eager to debate this
issue, and we believe we have a great
place to start—with the bipartisan,
House-passed bill on universal back-
ground checks.
Leader MCCONNELL has also sug-
gested that President Trump will de-
termine if and what the Senate will
vote on, so we need to know what the
President might support. Throughout
the month of August, frankly, the
President was all over the map, saying
he wanted strong background check
legislation one day and then saying,
the next day, we don’t need it at all. It
makes no sense. The President doesn’t
seem to know what he wants.
My Republican colleagues met with
the President yesterday and ostensibly
discussed the issue of gun safety. I
asked them: Where is the President on
this issue? Will he support universal
background checks?
We are eager to move forward with
this debate. We want to vote on the
H.R. 8 bill—a simple bill of universal
background checks. It does not impede
on the rights of any legitimate gun
owner. It only gets in the way of felons
and spousal abusers and those adju-
dicated mentally ill from getting guns,
and no one thinks they should get
them.
The President needs to make his po-
sition clear and soon. If he continues to
refuse to state his position or if he
keeps flipping around, the Senate
should proceed to debate this on its
own. In any case, you can be sure the
Democrats will not let the issue of gun
safety fall by the wayside.
I yield the floor.

TORNADO IN SIOUX FALLS
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, as I begin
this morning, I need to mention the
tornado that tore through my home-
town of Sioux Falls last night. Thank-
fully, there appear to have been no fa-
talities, but there has been a lot of
structural damage. I am grateful to all
of the emergency responders, the elec-
tric crews, and all of those who worked
through the night to keep the residents
safe. My thoughts are with Sioux Falls
today and with all of those who are
dealing with the tornado’s aftermath.
I had the opportunity this morning
to speak with Mayor Paul TenHaken,
of Sioux Falls, who, as you would ex-
pect, was up throughout the night with
his team. I just expressed our support
to him, to his team, and to our commu-
nity as they begin the process of the
cleanup and recovery from what was a
very damaging storm.
I also talked with my wife and older
daughter, who lives in Sioux Falls,
both of whom were in their basements
last night as, I think, most residents
were. I am glad to hear that people
took the necessary steps to keep them-
selves and their families safe.
As I have reported, so far—knock on
wood—we are not aware of injuries
that have been associated with this.
Yet I will continue to monitor the situ-
ation, and my staff and I are available
to help with whatever will be needed as
a result of this storm.
REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11TH
Mr. President, it is difficult to be-
lieve it has been 18 years since the Sep-
tember 11 attacks. That bright Sep-
tember morning is seared in our minds
as if it were yesterday—the shock, the
horror, the sense of unreality in the
days that followed, the grief and loss
but also the resolve and the unity of
purpose.
As always, where there is great evil,
good rises up in response—that of the
courageous passengers on Flight 93 who
laid down their lives to protect their
fellow Americans; Vietnam veteran and
Morgan Stanley security chief Rick
Rescorla, who successfully evacuated
more than 2,000 of his firm’s employees
from the World Trade Center and died
returning to help evacuate others;
Jason Thomas and Dave Karnes, two
former marines who dropped every-
thing and sped to the Towers and saved
the lives of the two Port Authority of-
ficers they found who had been trapped
in the rubble; National Guard pilots
Heather Penney and Marc Sasseville,
who scrambled their F–16s—
weaponless—to meet the threat that
was headed toward DC and who were
prepared to sacrifice their lives by
ramming their aircraft into Flight 93
before it could hit the Capitol or the
White House; and the hundreds of first
responders who ran toward the Towers,
toward the inferno, and headed up the
steps while civilians ran down.
Then there were the countless ordi-
nary Americans who were far away
from New York and Washington who
flooded blood banks and overwhelmed
organizations like the Red Cross with
their donations; who stormed Heaven
with prayers for the missing and the
injured and the suffering; and who
proudly flew their flags and reached
out to their neighbors.
In the weeks and months and years
to come, there was a 9/11 generation of
soldiers—those who signed up in the
wake of September 11 to fight back
against the terrorists and those who
were already serving. They deployed
around the globe to fight terror and to
defend freedom, and thousands of them
laid down their lives. Eighteen years
on, we remember the horror of that
September day, but we are also lifted
up by the memory of the heroes who
came out of it.
For those of us who serve in Con-
gress, the anniversary of September 11
is also a reminder of the obligation we
have to provide for our Nation’s de-
fense and to ensure that we are pre-
pared to meet and defeat any threat. In
the Senate, I am proud that both par-
ties have worked together over the
past couple of years to rebuild our Na-
tion’s military after years of its being
underfunded and the strains of the War
on Terror.
September 11 is also a reminder of
our obligation to care for those who
stand between us and danger—our sol-
diers, our veterans, our first respond-
ers, and our law enforcement officers.
They take on a heavy burden so the

rest of us can live in peace and safety.
We owe them a debt we can never
repay. This year, Congress overwhelm-
ingly passed legislation to make the
September 11 Victim Compensation
Fund permanent to ensure that first
responders whose health has suffered in
the wake of their work at Ground Zero,
at the Pentagon, and in Pennsylvania
will have the resources they need.
While we are on the subject of vet-
erans, like all of my colleagues, I am
saddened that Senator JOHNNY ISAKSON
is retiring at the end of this year.
We were members of the same fresh-
man class in 2004. During his time here,
he has been a tireless advocate for vet-
erans, and he will be deeply missed.
Yet his hard work in the Senate as the
head of the Committee on Veterans’
Affairs will continue to bear fruit, and
we will continue to work to implement
the VA reforms he shepherded to en-
sure our veterans receive the care they
have earned.
I was here in Washington, DC, on
September 11, and I evacuated the Cap-
itol Complex. One of the things I re-
member very clearly from that day
were the Capitol police officers who di-
rected us out of the buildings. We were
running from the danger, and they
were not. They were not going any-
where until they were sure every last
man and woman had made his way out.
Against that spirit of courage and
self-sacrifice, evil will never ulti-
mately triumph. May God bless all of
those who stand between us and dan-
ger. May He bless the victims of Sep-
tember 11 and their families, and may
He continue to bless the United States
of America.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask

NOMINATION OF MICHELLE BOWMAN
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to
speak on the nomination of Governor
Michelle Bowman to be a member of
the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System and the nomination of
Thomas Peter Feddo as Assistant Sec-
retary of the Treasury for Investment
Security in the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the United States.
First, I will speak about Governor
Bowman. Michelle Bowman currently
serves as a Governor on the Federal
Reserve Board and was the first person
to fill the Federal Reserve’s commu-
nity banking seat, after her confirma-
tion last year by a bipartisan vote of 64
to 34. Her current term expires on Jan-
uary 30, 2020, and President Trump has
renominated her to the same position
for a full 14-year term.
Prior to serving as Governor, she was
the State bank commissioner of Kansas
from January 2017 to November 2018.
She also served as vice president of a
Kansas-based community bank, Farm-
ers & Drovers Bank, between 2010 and
2017 and served in a number of govern-
ment roles.
Confirming Governor Bowman to a
new 14-year term will provide the need-
ed stability on the Board.
During her current term as Governor,
she has played a crucial role at the
Federal Reserve by providing the com-
munity banking perspective and high-
lighting their importance to people,
households, and small businesses
across this Nation, as well as the U.S.
economy broadly. She has also contrib-
uted meaningfully toward appro-
priately tailoring regulations in ac-
cordance with S. 2155.
If confirmed, I am confident her ex-
perience and skill will continue to ben-
efit the Board in promoting the effec-
tive operation of the U.S. economy and
serving the public interest. I will be
voting in support of Governor Bowman
and urge my colleagues to vote in sup-
port of her nomination, as well, today.
Turning for a moment to another im-
portant issue regarding the Federal Re-
serve, I want to reinforce that main-
taining the independence of the Fed-
eral Reserve is of the utmost impor-
tance in this country.
The recent remarks made by former
New York Fed President Dudley urging
the Federal Reserve to sway an elec-
tion by using monetary policy are in-
credibly troubling. The job of the Fed-
eral Reserve is to provide this Nation
with a safer, more flexible, and more
stable monetary and financial system.
I continue to encourage the Federal
Reserve to conduct its monetary policy
while remaining independent of poli-
tics.
NOMINATION OF THOMAS PETER FEDDO
Mr. President, now I would like to
turn to the nomination of Thomas
Peter Feddo for Assistant Secretary of
the Treasury for Investment Security
in the Committee on Foreign Invest-
ment in the United States, or what we
often call CFIUS.
CFIUS plays an important role in to-
day’s investment market by reviewing
the national security implications of
certain transactions involving foreign
investment in the United States. Con-
gress recognized and underscored the
importance of this national security
job when it repurposed the previous As-
sistant Secretary slot with passage of
FIRRMA last July.
Up until that time, the Assistant
Secretary split his time between
CFIUS and work on international mar-
kets, and, today, the Assistant Sec-
retary for Investment Security is dedi-
cated 100 percent to CFIUS responsibil-
ities.
Mr. Feddo’s nomination comes at an
important time in history, when Chi-
na’s ambitions forced Congress to re-
evaluate the reliance of U.S.-China
commerce and the laws and regulations
governing that connectivity.
FIRRMA expanded the jurisdictional
reach of CFIUS to better protect U.S.
cutting-edge technology companies
from hostile foreign takeover and in-
fluence based on a couple of concerns.
First, CFIUS did not have visibility
into many investments from China
that might provide coercive influence
over U.S. cutting-edge technology com-
panies. Second, these investments were
resulting in technology transfers that
could convey capabilities, advancing
Chinese economic and security inter-
ests while restricting the U.S. military
and national security structure from
leveraging that technology.
FIRRMA not only increased the
bandwidth of CFIUS but also expanded
the resources given to it to meet the
new level of today’s challenges.
The time is now to fill this sensitive
vacancy.
Thomas Feddo is the ideal candidate
to take up the mantle because he has
the keen intellect and natural sus-
picions of a dedicated financial war-
rior. He currently leads the U.S. De-
partment of the Treasury’s Office of In-
vestment Security in executing Treas-
ury’s statutory role as the chair of
CFIUS during one of the most trying
times that investment markets have
seen. For over a year now, he has led
the CFIUS team at Treasury, but be-
fore that, he put in a 7-year tour at the
Treasury Department’s Office of For-
eign Assets Control, where he oversaw
implementation and enforcement of
some 29 U.S. sanctions programs.
As a graduate of the U.S. Naval
Academy, with a degree in naval engi-
neering, Mr. Feddo served as a lieuten-
ant in the Navy’s nuclear submarine
force and as an officer at the Navy
Antiterrorist Alert Center. Because of
his unique experience and his technical
education, once confirmed, Mr. Feddo
will hit the ground running, moving
CFIUS forward in pursuit of its con-
tinuing mission to guard U.S. techno-
logical leadership from foreign adver-
saries.
I look forward to continuing con-
versations with him on opportunities
to improve America’s foreign invest-
ment review system, which requires
constant vigilance. I also look forward
to working with him on how we can
make CFIUS programs more effective
and efficient and be a faithful steward
of U.S. taxpayer dollars.
Mr. Feddo enjoys nearly unanimous
support from stakeholders, which
speaks volumes to his strong track
record of experience and expertise.
Thomas Feddo’s nomination was ad-
vanced by voice vote in the Senate
Banking Committee on June 18, 2019,
with overwhelming bipartisan support.
I ask my colleagues once again to vote
to confirm him to this critical post.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5418 September 11, 2019
BACKGROUND CHECKS
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, before
I begin, I would like to take just a mo-
ment to remember the thousands of in-
nocent lives lost 18 years ago today and
to thank the first responders who so
bravely sacrificed their lives in the
service of others.
September 11 is a day that will al-
ways weigh heavily upon our Nation,
but it is also a day that shows the
strength and resiliency of the Amer-
ican people. In response to tragedy, we
saw beyond our differences and came
together as a country. That is the les-
son we must never forget.
Today, I come to the floor as a voice
for families in my home State of Wash-
ington who have had enough of just
‘‘thoughts and prayers’’ and as a moth-
er and a grandmother who has had
enough of them too. My heart breaks
with every report of another horrific
mass shooting.
Like my colleagues here today and
the rest of our country, I watched in
horror last month as devastating gun
violence claimed dozens of innocent
lives and threw our communities into a
state of panic yet again. This heart-
break has become all too familiar to so
many of us—from El Paso and Odessa,
to Dayton, to Maryville in my home
State of Washington, and in schools
and movie theaters and community
spaces across our country. So what we
are doing here today is refusing to ac-
cept this as normal and demanding the
change that so many families are cry-
ing out for.
Democrats are committed to heeding
the voices of countless people back in
Washington State and across our coun-
try who are desperate for leaders in
this Washington—including President
Trump and Leader MCCONNELL—to ad-
dress this crisis. That is why I am join-
ing my colleagues on the Senate floor
throughout today to call on Leader
MCCONNELL to take up commonsense
gun safety legislation, starting with
universal background checks.
We know universal background
checks save lives by closing dangerous
loopholes to help keep guns out of the
hands of people who should not have
them. That is why more than 80 per-
cent of Americans support universal
background checks and are demanding
immediate action from Congress to
make universal background checks the
law of the land.
There certainly are other steps we
can take as well. We could strengthen
the extreme risk protection orders,
which have worked in my home State
of Washington. We could revive the as-
sault weapons ban, invest in gun vio-
lence prevention research, and regulate
firearm magazine limits. All of those
steps could save lives and prevent more
families from enduring the horrific
pain and trauma too many already
have. But H.R. 8—the universal back-
ground check legislation that has al-
ready passed the House—is literally
sitting here in the Senate, waiting to
be called up for a vote.
As I close, I want to be clear. Passing
universal background checks must be
this body’s first order of business if we
are serious about protecting people and
helping to keep guns out of the wrong
hands. I and all of my Democratic col-
leagues and so many others are going
to keep up the pressure as long as we
have to, to get this done.
Mr. President, I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11TH
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
think everyone knows today is the an-
niversary of 9/11. Many of us here re-
member evacuating this very building
on September 11, 2001. We knew the
world would never be the same.
For the people of New York, an ordi-
nary beautiful morning was brought to
a screeching halt as the clear blue sky
filled with smoke. For those at the
Pentagon, the workdays in service of
our Nation turned into a literal night-
mare. For hundreds of air travelers,
routine flights gave way to tragedy,
and, thanks to the bravery of pas-
sengers and crew, incredible acts of
heroism.
The Senate stands with the entire
Nation as we remember the terrible
events of 18 years ago today and the
nearly 3,000 innocent lives that terror-
ists stole away. We stand in solidarity
with those who still grieve, and we
honor the patriotic resolve that in-
spired first responders, U.S. service-
members, and countless Americans
who dedicated themselves, that day
and since, to selflessly keeping our Na-
tion safe.
May our remembrances renew our
commitment to building a world where
terrorist evil has no home. May we
never forget.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I join
the leader. Eighteen years ago, on a
cloudless Tuesday morning, my city,
our country, and our world changed
forever. In the span of a few hours, the
Twin Towers fell, the Pentagon was
hit, and smoke rose from an empty
field in Pennsylvania.
More than 3,000 souls were taken
from us that day. I knew some of them:
a guy I played basketball with in high
school, a businessman who helped me
on the way up, and a firefighter whom
I went around the city doing blood
drives with. It was one of the bloodiest
days on American soil since the Civil
War.
Each year we correctly and appro-
priately pause to remember that awful
day. We mourn those whom we lost and
think of them. The day after 9/11, I
called for every American to wear the
flag. I wear this flag every day. I have
worn it every day since then in mem-
ory of them.
We also remember our resiliency and
the resiliency of New Yorkers, the
brave firefighters, police officers, and

ordinary citizens who rushed to the
Towers.
The generosity—I will never forget a
man who had a shoe store about two
blocks north of the Towers who just
gave shoes to all the people. Some men
and women who had to run 90 flight of
stairs left their shoes behind.
I remember the next day, when Presi-
dent Bush sent us back up to New
York, and the empty skies, a bunch of
F–16s around our plane going down
there, smelling the smell of burnt flesh
and death in the air, and seeing over
1,000 people lined up with little signs,
because we didn’t know who was gone
and who might be found: Have you seen
my sister Mary? Have you seen my son
Bob?
It was an awful day and a day we live
with, but we know our resilience. Many
predicted that Lower Manhattan would
be a ghost town forevermore. It has
more people, more jobs, and more busi-
ness than before 9/11. Many thought
that America would succumb to the
evil brutality of the terrorists. We have
fought back very successfully.
We think, finally, of those who are
dying now as a result of their rushing
to the Towers into the hours and days
after, and we are also grateful that this
body has now fully funded both the
health fund and the fund to see that
the families are taken care of.
It is an amazing moment. I live with
it all the time. I ride my bike around
the city, and every seventh or eighth
block has the name of a street com-
memorating someone who died—fire-
fighter this and police officer that.
But America, New York, and all of us
have not been beaten by the terrorists
and have not been beaten by adversity.
On this issue, we have come together,
and we will prevail.
I ask unanimous consent that there
be a minute of silence in memory of
those who were lost both that day and
who are still being lost because of their
heroism a few days after.

S5420 September 11, 2019
REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11TH
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as we
all know, today we commemorate the
solemn anniversary of the attacks on 9/
11/2001.
If you ask anybody who is old enough
to remember where they were that day,
I bet they can tell you. It is one of
those rare moments that defines an en-
tire generation.
I have always said that it is etched in
my memory like the only other event
in my lifetime that might rise to that
level of shock and horror, and that is
the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy.
Eighteen years ago today, I was in
Austin, talking on the phone to then-
Governor Rick Perry. When I hung up
the phone, my wife said, ‘‘You need to
see this,’’ pointing to the TV set. That
was just as the second plane hit the
World Trade Center, and we all know
what came after.
It was the same image that millions
of Americans struggled to understand
on that morning and still struggle to
comprehend today—how someone could
be so evil and so determined to take in-
nocent lives.
September 11 serves as a dividing line
in American history. For people like
me, there is before and there is after,
but for an entire generation of younger
people, there is really only after. I be-
lieve this 18th anniversary carries spe-
cial weight because those young people
who have only lived in a post-9/11 world
will now be able to vote in our elec-
tions, serve in our military, and help
shape the future of our country.
It is a reminder of our commitment
as a nation to carry out the promise we
made in the wake of the attack to
‘‘never forget’’—never forget.
As Americans, we must remain vigi-
lant, and we must remain with a strong
sense of purpose and a strong moral
clarity regarding confronting evil in
all its forms. We vow to carry the
memory of the nearly 3,000 lives lost
that day in our hearts, the sense of pa-
triotism that welled up inside of each
of us, and the determination never to
be intimidated, and never to back
down.
Today, we remember the families
who lost loved ones that day, the first
responders who ran not away from but
toward the danger, and the commit-
ment of our Armed Forces, who fight
to eradicate terrorism around the globe
each and every day.
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT
Mr. President, on another matter, for
a quarter of a century, the North
American Free Trade Agreement has
guided our trade relationship with
Mexico and Canada. When NAFTA was
created, it sought to remove the bar-
riers that impeded free and fair trade
to provide benefits to all three coun-
tries. While this agreement has cer-
tainly had its share of critics and
champions, I think there is no doubt—
certainly, in my mind—that NAFTA
has been a benefit to the United States.
Last year, U.S. goods and services
trade with Mexico and Canada totaled
nearly $1.4 trillion. Across every indus-
try, from major companies to small
businesses, an estimated 12 million
American jobs rely on trade with our
NAFTA partners—12 million.
The importance of maintaining
strong trade ties is certainly under-
stood in my home State of Texas, and
that is in large part because—and this
will not surprise you—last year, Texas
exported nearly $110 billion in goods to
Mexico, our next-door neighbor, 35 per-
cent of our State’s total exports.
We also imported more than $107 bil-
lion in goods from Mexico, including
everything from motor vehicle parts to
computer equipment, to tractors and
avocados. It is not uncommon to see
certain products, like automobile
parts, crossing the border multiple
times during the manufacturing proc-
ess before eventually making their way
to the customer.
NAFTA has fueled the economies of
every State across the country, but a
lot has changed since NAFTA was rati-
fied in 1993. At that time, the internet
was in its infancy, smartphones didn’t
exist, and shopping at brick-and-mor-
tar stores was the norm. Countless eco-
nomic advancements and our digi-
talized marketplace have fundamen-
tally changed the global trade land-
scape. So it is clearly time to mod-
ernize NAFTA and bring it up to cur-
rent needs.
I was glad when the heads of all three
countries signed the U.S.-Mexico-Can-
ada Agreement last November and took
major steps just to get that far, but the
new NAFTA—or, as we call it, the
USMCA—takes into account businesses
and practices that didn’t even exist
when NAFTA existed, things like 2-day
shipping, online micro-retailers, and
digital products like e-books and
music.
The USMCA will require Mexico and
Canada to raise their de minimis ship-
ment value levels, which will allow cer-
tain classes of shipments to enter all
three countries with expedited entry
procedures. That is a big win for small
and medium-sized businesses, which
often lack the resources to pay cus-
toms duties and taxes.
Overall, the USMCA takes steps to
advance the digital economy, which ac-
counted for nearly 7 percent of our
total economy in 2017.
A few months ago, the International
Trade Commission publicly released its
analysis of the economic impact of the
USMCA, which shows some positive in-
dicators. The ITC concluded that, with-
in 6 years, the USMCA will raise real
GDP in the United States by $68.2 bil-
lion and lead to the creation of 176,000
new jobs.
We can also expect a more than $33
billion increase in exports and more
than $31 billion in imports. That is
great news for North American work-
ers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses
that will reap the benefits of this
agreement.
When I was traveling around the
State during August, one of the most
frequent questions I encountered from
my constituents was this: When is Con-
gress going to pass the USMCA? I as-
sured them that I am just as eager as
they are to see Congress ratify this
agreement, but we are still waiting on
the House and the administration to
iron out their differences.
I know that the U.S. Trade Rep-
resentative, Ambassador Lighthizer,
and Secretary Mnuchin are having con-
structive conversations with the
Speaker of the House, and she has set
up a process by which the House can
provide its necessary input into the
final product, but we are all waiting to
see the Speaker turn on the green light
to allow them to start the process—
sooner, hopefully, rather than later.
We know that, historically speaking,
the closer we get to an election, the
more challenging it is to get things
passed, particularly in a divided Con-
gress, like we have now. So I hope we
can get this process moving soon.
Businesses, jobs, and communities in
Texas rely on a strong trade relation-
ship between the U.S., Mexico, and
Canada. While NAFTA has benefited all
three countries, it is not able to propel
our economies into the future. That is
why the USMCA is so important.
The USMCA increases goods’ market
access. It supports small businesses. As
I said, it supports digital trade, safe-
guards intellectual property, supports
our agriculture sector, and keeps jobs
right here at home.
Free and fair trade isn’t just good
news for our economy. It is good news
for the people behind it. This is a trade
agreement built for the 21st century,
and it is time for Congress to pass the
USMCA and provide greater stability
and more opportunities for North
American workers.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
NOMINATION OF DALE CABANISS
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President,
just a little bit earlier today, the Sen-
ate voted to confirm President Trump’s
nomination of Dale Cabaniss to lead
the Office of Personnel Management.
I voted against this nominee, but
now that she is confirmed, it is more
important than ever for the Senate and
the House to fulfill our oversight du-
ties to protect our civil servants from
political interference. I know the Pre-
siding Officer has a keen interest in
this subject as well, in his capacity as
chairman of the Subcommittee on Reg-
ulatory Affairs and Federal Manage-
ment, overseeing Federal civil service,
and I appreciate his work on that
front.
In order to do their jobs for the
American people, our Federal employ-
ees must be able to perform their du-
ties free of politics. They must be
judged on the merits of their work, not
political favoritism or cronyism. They
must be able to present factual infor-
mation and analysis without fear of
retribution. Yet time and again, we

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5421
September 11, 2019
have seen that this President, Presi-
dent Trump, views civil servants as his
adversaries.
The President has sought to silence
those whose work or words contradict
him, even when the facts are clear. We
saw that most recently when the Na-
tional Weather Service tried to calm
residents in the State of Alabama after
President Trump falsely stated that
Hurricane Dorian would put them at
severe risk. Secretary of Commerce
Wilbur Ross reportedly threatened to
fire the agency’s leadership after they
corrected the President’s false state-
ments about Hurricane Dorian and Ala-
bama. Just within the last hour, the
New York Times is reporting that the
order to change the statements at
NOAA came directly from the White
House in the form of a directive from
the Acting Chief of Staff to the Presi-
dent, Mick Mulvaney.
We have also seen this pattern at
other times. We saw President Trump
standing side by side with Vladimir
Putin in Helsinki, while President
Trump sided with Putin’s claims about
noninterference in the 2016 Presidential
elections, and where President Trump
threw our own U.S. intelligence agency
experts under the bus.
These assaults on the Federal civil
service and the efforts to undermine
the integrity of the Federal civil serv-
ice have also included an assault on
Federal employees. This administra-
tion knows that workers are stronger
when they are organized and have rep-
resentatives who can speak on their be-
half. Many—not all, but many—of the
Trump agency heads have repeatedly
refused to comply with the law and to
bargain in good faith with their work-
ers. Instead of trying to negotiate,
they have tried to impose contracts
and terms unilaterally. This has al-
ready happened at the Social Security
Administration, where agency manage-
ment has shown particular hostility to
the unions representing their work-
force. Some of these issues are now tied
up in the courts, but I would hope we
could work on a bipartisan basis to ad-
dress these challenges.
Now, President Trump is trying to
abolish the Office of Personnel Man-
agement. That brings me to the nomi-
nation of Ms. Cabaniss, because she
will be directed to preside over the dis-
mantlement of the agency—that is, if
the President has his way. I know
those of us in Congress with a different
view will be weighing in as well.
The Office of Personnel Management
is an independent Federal agency with
an absolutely vital mission—to
strengthen and protect the Federal
civil service system. Their role is to
protect the integrity of our Federal
civil service and prevent it from being
hijacked by political forces.
I know there has been a lot of talk
that this is all about civil service re-
form. As I look at the proposals, I don’t
see it that way. I see these proposals as
an attack on the institution that de-
fends our civil service system.
The Office of Personnel Management
needs a strong, independent leader who
will protect the Federal workforce
from partisan interference and defend
agencies from the administration’s at-
tacks. After looking at Ms. Cabaniss’s
record, she is not the right person to
lead OPM. When she chaired the Fed-
eral Labor Relations Authority, morale
was dead last among small Federal
agencies. That is the agency that is
supposed to resolve disputes between
Federal workers and management, but
55 percent of their decisions were over-
turned under Ms. Cabaniss’s jurisdic-
tion.
OPM’s mission is vital to the success
of our Federal civil service and their
ability to deliver services to the Amer-
ican people. We need a leader who is
going to stand up for the integrity of
that system, not one who is going to
preside over the dismantlement of that
agency. So I hope we can work on a bi-
partisan basis to ensure that this coun-
try preserves one of its vital assets,
which is a nonpartisan civil service.
Presidents come and Presidents go,
and Presidents, of course, give direc-
tion to the different agencies, but we
will be doing a great disservice to the
people of this country if we allow polit-
ical cronyism to seep into this system
and create an environment where peo-
ple fear speaking out, telling the truth,
and providing the facts.
I want to take this opportunity
today, as we discuss the nomination of
the Office of Personnel Management,
to raise that larger issue, and I hope we
will be united in that effort because
lots of countries around the world suf-
fer from political cronyism. The United
States has helped shield itself from
that by establishing decades and dec-
ades ago a system that tries to immu-
nize ourselves against that kind of po-
litical infection in terms of the day-to-
day work that we ask people to do and
carry on, on behalf of the American
people. Let’s work together to accom-
plish what I believe is a bipartisan
goal.
I yield the remainder of my time.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11TH
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, before I
get into the substance of what I want
to talk about, I am going to take my
own personal opportunity to remember
those whom we lost 18 years ago today.
Like everyone else, I remember the
events. I was at home with my family
and young children, not knowing what
was going to happen and seeing things
happen. I can remember taking one of
my kids to daycare when the second
tower collapsed and the radio an-
nouncer simply saying, ‘‘They are both
gone,’’ and the emptiness we felt.
We remember today, we honor today,
and we honor not only those whom we
lost but honor those responders who
were there and who still suffer the pain
from having to deal with all of that.
FUTURE ACT
Mr. President, I rise today almost a
year ago since I first came to the Sen-
ate floor to discuss the state of our Na-
tion’s historically Black colleges and
universities and other minority-serving
institutions.
As I did then, and many times since,
I am again making an urgent call to
colleagues to act. At the end of this
month, at the end of the fiscal year,
nearly half of all Federal funds these
schools receive each year, and have for
a long time, is going to end. That is
$255 million annually that they have
had available to count on for well over
a decade. That is going to come to a
screeching halt if we don’t act, and we
need to act now.
These historic institutions serve
nearly 4 million students of color.
Many of our Nation’s brightest minds
have matriculated at these institu-
tions. HBCUs are the leading educators
for African-American PhDs in science
and engineering. They are foundational
to building generational wealth in
communities that have long faced
headwinds in doing so. They are doing
amazing work. They are doing incred-
ible work with very limited resources
and with their own individual financial
headwinds to contend with.
In Alabama, we are home to 14
HBCUs—more than any State in the
country—so they are an integral part
of my home State’s higher education
system. Just as important, they are in-
tegral to the economy of Alabama.
Minority-serving institutions play a
central role in America’s higher edu-
cation system. For example, Hispanic-
Serving Institutions account for 13 per-
cent of all nonprofit colleges. Yet they
enroll 62 percent of all Hispanic stu-
dents.
More than 75 percent of students at
HBCUs and nearly 80 percent of stu-
dents at Tribal colleges and univer-
sities receive Pell grants, compared to
only 32 percent of all students. These
schools have a very serious purpose for
these kids who otherwise might get
shut out, likely would get shut out of
our higher education system. They are
so important, and they face such
strong headwinds financially to
achieve.
Last year, we held our first HBCU
summit where we brought all of our
HBCUs in Alabama together to talk
about the challenges, to talk about
what they were facing but also to talk
about opportunities to work together,
to work with the State, to work with
the Congress, to try to meet the chal-
lenges of our workforce of the 21st cen-
tury, to try to meet the challenges of
our educational system in general.
What I saw was an amazing group of
people—amazing group of people who
were doing the work for their students
and for their communities, people who

are committed from deep down in their
heart. They love these kids. They love
the purpose they are serving, and they
are thinking ahead. They are thinking
outside the box. These are not institu-
tions that are so cookie cutter that
they are not willing to explore new op-
portunities for their students. They are
seizing every one of those opportuni-
ties.
I have seen firsthand, though, in-
creasing concern from our HBCU com-
munity. Given their significance, it is
frustrating that some of these schools
continue to struggle. Public and pri-
vate HBCUs face extensive capital
project needs but have few funding
sources to rely on.
On top of that, the Government Ac-
countability Office found that HBCUs’
average endowment is half the size of a
similar sized non-HBCU. We have to
change that. We have to make sure we
provide to these schools because the
bottom line is, they have no safety net.
They struggle. They work. They do the
things. The bottom line is, they have
no safety net. If they have no safety
net, neither do the students they serve.
This time last year, I was talking
about legislation I had introduced
called the Strengthening Minority-
Serving Institutions Act, which would
have permanently extended and in-
creased mandatory funding to all mi-
nority-serving institutions. That bill
was supported by one-quarter of the
Senate. Unfortunately, it was simply
all Democrats. We could not get the bi-
partisan support that I hope we will
get in the future. However, now we are
here and only have 19 days left in the
fiscal year, and these schools still have
no certainty about whether these crit-
ical funds will continue to be available.
We hear a lot in this body about the
need to make sure we continue to fund
government, that we continue to fund
our military, and about how dev-
astating even a continuing resolution
might be to the Defense Department
because it doesn’t allow the military to
plan. I agree with that. I see it. This is
$255 million that all of a sudden is
going to be cut off completely from
schools that have relied on it, that
have planned, that have done their
budgets around it. We owe it to them.
We owe it to them to make sure that
we get this funding because they give
so much back to us.
Ensuring equal access to quality edu-
cation should not be a partisan issue,
and I worked over the last year to find
a solution that I think should receive
and could receive broad bipartisan sup-
port. I believe we have that in the Fos-
tering Undergraduate Talent by
Unlocking Resources for Education
Act. It is called the FUTURE Act,
which I have introduced with my col-
league Senator TIM SCOTT and Rep-
resentatives ALMA ADAMS and MARK
WALKER in the House.
The FUTURE Act reauthorizes fund-
ing for the next 2 fiscal years, main-
taining just level funding of $255 mil-
lion a year. It is the least we could do.
Our bill checks all the boxes. It helps
institutions in 43 States. It is bipar-
tisan, it is bicameral, and it is paid for.
Let’s not delay any longer. With this
important bill, let’s get this to the
floor. Let’s come up with something so
we can show the American people how
important these institutions are and
just as important, we show the Amer-
ican people that, doggone it, we can get
something done. That is the most frus-
trating part I heard about when I went
back to Alabama over the recess: When
are you going to get something done,
Jones?
Well, it is difficult. You all know it.
It is difficult, but this is a piece of leg-
islation that ought to receive support
in this body and across the aisle, across
the Capitol in the House.
This week we have a lot of the HBCU
presidents and administrators who are
on Capitol Hill. They are coming up for
their own benefit but also for the Con-
gressional Black Caucus events that
are later this week. They are here on
the Hill. It would be the perfect time to
get this to the floor. I don’t see it on
the schedule anywhere, but it would be
the perfect time.
As people are looking here, as they
are watching us and listening to us,
they know we support their institu-
tions. Let’s show them we support
their institutions.
I urge my colleagues to support the
FUTURE Act. Get onboard with us.
Sponsor this legislation and, in turn,
support our Nation’s minority-serving
institutions of higher education. Their
graduates deserve the same quality
education as any other student, and
they deserve a fair shot at a successful
future. Let’s get this done. Let’s do our
job and get this done.
Mr. President, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut.
BACKGROUND CHECKS
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am
going to be joined on the floor over the
course of about an hour or so by Mem-
bers of the Senate who are desperate
for our colleagues to wake up and rec-
ognize that the time for action to quell
the epidemic of gun violence in this
country is now. It was also last week.
It was also a month ago and a year ago
and 6 years ago. It was also nearly 7
years ago, after the shooting in my
State of Connecticut that felled 20 lit-
tle 6- and 7-year-olds attending first
grade at Sandy Hook Elementary
School.
We tend to pay attention to the mass
shootings—the ones in Odessa, El Paso,
Dayton, and Newtown—but every sin-
gle day in this country, 93 people die
from gunshot wounds. Most of those
are suicides, but many of them are
homicides, and others are accidental
shootings. When you total it up, we are
losing about 33,000 people every year
from gun violence and gunshot wounds.
Those numbers may not be that
meaningful to you because it is a big
country, but how does that compare to
the rest of the world or at least the
rest of the high-income world? Well,
that is about 10 times higher than
other countries of similar income and
of similar situation as the United
States. Something different is hap-
pening here. It is not that we have
more mental illness. It is not that we
have less mental health treatment. It
is not that we have less resources going
into law enforcement. The difference is
that we have guns spread out all over
this Nation, many of them illegal and
many of them of a caliber and capacity
that were designed for the military in
which this slaughter becomes predict-
able. We have a chance to do something
about it right now in the U.S. Con-
gress. We have a chance to try to find
some way to come together over some
commonsense measures.
I just got off the phone—a 40-minute
conversation with the President of the
United States. I was glad that he was
willing to take that amount of time
with me, Senator MANCHIN, and Sen-
ator TOOMEY to talk about whether we
can figure out a way to get Repub-
licans and Democrats on board with a
proposal to expand background checks
to more gun sales in this Nation. In
particular, we were talking about ex-
panding background checks to com-
mercial gun sales. That is certainly not
as far as I would like to go, but I un-
derstand that part of my job here is to
argue for my beliefs and my convic-
tions but then try to find a com-
promise.
There is no single legislative initia-
tive that will solve all of these issues,
but what we know is, if you want to
take the biggest bite out of gun crime
as quickly as possible, increasing the
number of background checks done in
this country is the way to go. All we
are trying to do here is make sure that
when you buy a gun, you prove that
you aren’t someone with a serious
criminal history or that you aren’t
someone who has a serious history of
mental illness.
In 2017, about 170,000 people in this
country went into a store, tried to buy
a gun, and were denied that sale be-
cause they had an offense on their
record or a period of time in an inpa-
tient psychiatric unit, which prohib-
ited them from buying a gun. Of those
170,000 sales that were denied, 39 per-
cent of them were convicted felons who
had tried to come in and buy a gun,
many of them knowing they were like-
ly prohibited from buying those guns.
The problem is, that isn’t a barrier to
buying a weapon—being denied a sale
at a gun store. Why do we know that?
It is because just a few weeks ago in
Texas, a gunman who went in and shot
up 7 people who died and 23 who were
injured failed a background check be-
cause he had been diagnosed by a clini-
cian as mentally ill and had triggered
one of those prohibiting clauses, but
then he went and bought the gun from
a private seller, knowing that he
wouldn’t have to go through a back-
ground check if he bought the weapon
from a place in Texas that didn’t have

a background check attached to it. He
then took that weapon and turned it on
civilians.
This happens over and over again
every single day. Estimates are that at
least 20 percent of all gun sales in this
country happen without a background
check. These aren’t gifts of guns to a
relative or a loaner to somebody who is
going to go and use it for hunting on a
Saturday or Sunday; this is about le-
gitimate commercial transactions, 20
percent of which, when they involve
guns, happen without a background
check.
We also have plenty of data from
States that have decided to expand
background checks to make them uni-
versal. States requiring universal back-
ground checks for all gun sales have
homicide rates that are 15 percent
lower than States that don’t have
those laws.
In Connecticut, we have research
showing that when we extended back-
ground checks to all gun sales through
a local permitting process, we had a 40-
percent reduction in gun homicide
rates. Compare that with the State of
Missouri, which repealed its permitting
law, which was their way of making
sure that everybody who buys a gun
has to get a background check. They
saw a 23-percent increase in firearm
homicides immediately after they
started allowing people to buy guns
without a background check.
There is your data. It is pretty incon-
trovertible. You can get pretty imme-
diate and serious returns—safety re-
turns—if you expand background
checks to all gun purchases. But the
benefit to a U.S. Senator who has to go
back for reelection every 6 years is
that not only are background checks as
a legislative initiative impactful, they
are also very politically popular. In
fact, very few things are more popular
than expanding background checks to
more gun sales.
Ninety percent of Americans want
universal background checks. Apple pie
is not that popular. Baseball is not
that popular. Background checks are.
You are not going to get in trouble
with your constituents if you vote to
expand background checks to all com-
mercial sales or all private sales in this
country. You are going to get rewarded
politically if you do that. I don’t argue
that that is the reason you vote for
background checks, but I think you
should accept the plaudits that will
come to you from your constituents if
you support this measure.
I don’t think the President has made
up his mind yet. After spending about
40 minutes on the phone with him this
afternoon, I don’t know that the Presi-
dent is convinced yet that he should
support universal background checks.
I was with the President right after
the Parkland shooting, and he said he
would support universal background
checks, and then he didn’t support
them after speaking to representatives
of the gun lobby. I am sure the gun
lobby will come in and talk to the
President this afternoon or tomorrow
and try to explain to him why he
should once again endorse the status
quo.
The status quo is not acceptable to
Americans in this country. People are
sick and tired of feeling unsafe when
they walk into a Walmart. Parents are
heartbroken when their children come
home and tell them about the latest
active-shooter drill they participated
in. I know that from direct experience,
having listened to my then-kinder-
gartner tell me about being stuffed
into a tiny bathroom with 25 of his
other colleagues and told by his teach-
er to remain as quiet as possible be-
cause they were practicing what would
happen if a stranger came into their
school. Some of the kids knew what it
was really about and some of them
didn’t, but my 7-year-old—6 years old
at the time—knew enough to say to
me: ‘‘Daddy, I didn’t like it.’’ No child
should have to fear for their safety
when they walk to school.
I am not saying that universal back-
ground checks can solve all of our gun
violence issues in this country. I will
say that beyond the lives that it will
save, it will also send a message to our
children and to families in this country
that we are not encased in concrete,
that we are trying our best to reach
out across the aisle and come to some
conclusion to at least save some lives.
I will tell you that peace of mind,
that moral signal of compassion and
concern that we will send, will have a
value, as well, next to and beside the
actual lives we will save.
Leilah Hernandez was 15 years old.
She was a high school student when she
was shot by the gunman in Odessa, TX.
Her grandmother Nora explained how
Leilah would spend a lot of her time
with family and would drop by after
school to visit her grandmother. She
described Leilah as a happy girl who
adored her parents. She was described
at her funeral as ‘‘a naturally shy girl
who became a quiet leader on the bas-
ketball court.’’
Lois Oglesby was 27 when she was
killed in the Dayton shooting. Her
friend Derasha Merrett said: ‘‘She was
a wonderful mother, a wonderful per-
son.’’ According to the children’s fa-
ther, Oglesby face-timed him after she
was shot, saying ‘‘Babe, I just got shot
in my head. I need to get to my kids.’’
She died that day in Dayton.
Jordan and Andre Anchondo were 25
and 23 years old when they were
amongst the 22 who were killed in El
Paso. The couple had dropped their 5-
year-old daughter at cheer practice,
and then they went to Walmart to pick
up some back-to-school supplies. Their
2-month-old son Paul was with them.
He survived the shooting, probably be-
cause it looks like Jordan died shield-
ing her baby, while Andre jumped in
front of the two of them. The baby was
found under Jordan’s body and miracu-
lously suffered only two broken fin-
gers.
On August 31 in Buffalo, NY, Norzell
Aldridge saw an altercation happening
from a distance. He went over to the
altercation to try to defuse the situa-
tion. He was a youth league football
coach. As he tried to deal with this al-
tercation, he was shot and killed. One
of his friends said: ‘‘The guy died a
hero trying to save somebody else’s
life.’’ One of the folks who work in
football with him said: ‘‘His legacy will
always be never give up, give it your
all, and now his legacy is through his
son.’’
You haven’t heard of Norzell because
he didn’t die in a mass shooting. He is
just one of the routine gun murders
that happen every single day in this
country. It matters just as much as
those that occurred in El Paso and
Dayton and Odessa, and we can do
something about those right now.
I am begging the President to come
to the table and agree to a common-
sense background checks expansion bill
that will save lives. I am begging my
colleagues here to do the same—figure
out a way to get to yes. There is no po-
litical liability in it for you. There are
thousands and thousands of lives to be
saved.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut.
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I
am honored to follow my colleague
from Connecticut after his powerful
and eloquent description of the lives
that have been lost, the stakes of this
decision, and the clear path we have—
an opportunity and an obligation to
save lives.
Let me begin where he ended. The
President of the United States has an
obligation here to lead. If he does, we
will have legislation that will literally
save thousands of lives. He has an obli-
gation, as we do, to find a way to save
these lives.
All of us have seen all too often the
needless, senseless, and unspeakable
tragedy done by gun violence. We focus
on the mass killings, but those 90
deaths a day consist of the drive-by,
one-by-one shootings in Hartford and
New Haven and Bridgeport and cities
and towns and communities around the
country. No one is immune. No family
is untouched, through friends and rel-
atives and workplaces and through sui-
cides, which are a major part of those
90 deaths every day in this country.
Domestic violence is made five times
more deadly when there is a gun in the
home.
The President must not only come to
the table but lead. And if he will not
lead, get out of the way because we
have an obligation to move forward
now and take advantage of this his-
toric opportunity and obligation.
Just weeks ago, in one 24-hour pe-
riod, massacres in El Paso and Dayton
left 31 people dead. Eleven days ago, a
shooter in Odessa, TX, killed another
seven. Communities are forever
changed by these events, and so is our
Nation. The trauma and the stress done
in schools to our children by the drills
they conduct, by the anticipation that

S5424 September 11, 2019
is raised, by the fear that is engen-
dered—the sights and sounds of gun vi-
olence echo and reverberate across our
land.
I remember the sights and sounds of
the parents at the firehouse in Sandy
Hook on that horrible day in 2012 when
20 beautiful children and sixth grade
educators died. The firehouse is where
parents went to find out whether their
children were OK. The way they found
out was either their children appeared
or they did not.
For them, in the cries and sobbing
they experienced, the expressions of
anguish, the look on those faces, it was
only the beginning of their nightmare.
It transformed Connecticut. What we
did in Connecticut was adopt common-
sense measures and comprehensive
steps to stop gun violence.
The lesson of Connecticut is not only
that those steps have reduced gun vio-
lence, including homicide, but also
that States with the strongest laws are
still at the mercy of the ones with the
weakest because guns have no respect
for State boundaries. They cross State
lines, and they do damage and death in
States like Connecticut with strong
gun laws. Through the Iron Pipeline, it
comes from other States to our south.
Since that day at Sandy Hook, there
have been 2,218 mass shootings in the
United States, and over 2,000 times,
parents have sat, as did those parents
at Sandy Hook, and waited to know
whether their children were OK—chil-
dren who left in the morning with no
inkling about the violence that was to
unfold.
There is no reason people have to live
this way in the United States of Amer-
ica. America has no greater proportion
of mental health issues than any other
country. We have a higher rate of gun
violence. We can prevent it through
commonsense steps and comprehensive
steps that will save as many lives as
possible as quickly as possible by keep-
ing guns out of the hands of dangerous
people. That is the principle of the two
main proposals likely to come before
this body.
To keep guns out of the hands of dan-
gerous people, do it through back-
ground checks, which have to apply
universally to all States for them to be
effective. Experts estimate that 80 per-
cent of firearms acquired for criminal
purposes are obtained from unlicensed
sellers, and a recent study found that
States that have universal background
check laws experienced 52 percent
fewer mass shootings. Background
checks prevent people who are dan-
gerous to themselves or others from
buying firearms, and, likewise, emer-
gency risk protection orders take guns
away from people who are dangerous to
themselves or others. These two con-
cepts have a common goal, the same
end. They achieve it by complementary
means.
The vast majority of perpetrators of
mass violence exhibit clear signs that
they are about to carry out an attack.
The shooter in Parkland, as my col-
league Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM has
said, all but took out an ad in the
newspaper saying that he was going to
kill people at that school in Parkland.
The police were repeatedly alerted to
his violent behavior, including a call
from a family member who begged the
police to recover his weapon.
Today, in Florida, she could ask for
an extreme risk protection order under
a Florida law signed by my colleague
Senator SCOTT when he was Governor.
In the 17 jurisdictions that have passed
emergency risk protection order laws,
enforcers can petition courts to tempo-
rarily restrict access to firearms with
due process.
At a hearing this morning in the Ju-
diciary Committee, we learned from
one of the judges in Broward County
who enforce these laws that they have
worked to prevent shootings, including
many suicides, and they enable mental
health help to be available as well.
These laws prevent suicide. The major-
ity of those gun deaths in the United
States, in fact, are suicide, which is ac-
counting for 60 percent of those 90 peo-
ple killed every day.
Emergency risk protection orders are
effective, but they are resource inten-
sive, and that is why Senator GRAHAM
and I have worked hard and we are
close to finalizing a measure that will
provide grants and incentives to other
States that are considering or may
consider these kinds of laws. Together
with Senator GRAHAM, I have been
working hard on this legislation, and
we are close—after extensive discus-
sion, not only between us but with the
White House and with our colleagues—
to a bill that can muster bipartisan
support and pass this body.
The Charleston loophole must be
closed. I have been leading that fight in
the Senate to fix this problem for
years. The House passed bipartisan leg-
islation on background checks, H.R. 8,
and on the Charleston loophole that
would fix the problem of would-be mur-
derers having access to guns simply be-
cause information is unavailable with-
in the time limit that is set.
Guns should not be sold simply be-
cause a deadline for a background
check is not met. Most are done lit-
erally within seconds or a minute, but
some require more extensive work.
There is no reason to wait to pass these
measures.
Neither should we wait to pass a safe
storage bill that we believe would have
prevented deaths like Ethan Song’s
perishing in Guilford. This past Janu-
ary, Ethan Song would have celebrated
his 16th birthday, but a year earlier, he
was accidentally killed by a gun stored
in his friend’s closet, accessible to him
and a friend. Like Kristen and Mike
Song, thousands of other families
across America lose children in gun vi-
olence every year. It is a parent’s worst
nightmare, and, in many cases, safe
storage, including possibly Sandy
Hook, would have prevented a moun-
tain of heartache and a river of tears.
The Songs have been so strong and
courageous, as have been the survivors
of the victims’ families in Sandy Hook.
They have been the powerful faces and
voices of this effort and the most effec-
tive advocates.
The groups that have been formed in
these past years, raising awareness and
mobilizing every town—Guilford,
Brady, Newtown Action Alliance,
Sandy Hook Promise, Connecticut
Against Gun Violence, Moms Demand
Action, and Students Demand Action
are only some of them. They are
mounting a political movement, and
we need to hear them.
History will judge us harshly if we
fail to heed that call for commonsense
reform. The voters will judge harshly,
as well, the colleagues who fail to heed
that call.
We need to keep in mind that gun vi-
olence is not one problem. There is no
one solution. There is no panacea. We
need to aim at all of these measures,
including a ban on assault weapons and
high-capacity magazines. The House,
just this week, approved a ban on high-
capacity magazines, as well as an
emergency risk protection order stat-
ute.
Gun violence is many problems—not
one. It is the loopholes in the back-
ground check system; it is the failure
to safely store firearms; it is an arbi-
trary deadline for completing a back-
ground check; and it is the lack of
emergency risk protection orders that
take guns away from people who are
dangerous to themselves or others with
due process.
I have worked on this issue for more
than two decades—almost three dec-
ades since I was attorney general first
elected in the State of Connecticut.
There has been progress. The progress
has achieved results. Now it is this
body’s obligation to take that next
step, and I implore the President of the
United States to state his support,
which my colleagues across the aisle
have said is necessary for them to do
what they think is responsible. I say to
them: If the President fails to lead, you
must do so.
We must continue to fight and never
give up and never go away for the sake
of the survivors and families who said
from this Gallery when we failed to act
in the wake of Sandy Hook: Shame.
Shame on us, in fact, if we fail to act.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I join
with many of my colleagues to make a
pretty simple request, and that is, the
issue of gun violence in this country
requires us to take action.
The Senate needs to do what it has
historically been in place to do. The
Presiding Officer is in his first term,
and I am in my third term. The U.S.
Senate is the place in which we debate
and vote on issues, the greatest delib-
erative body in the world—at least that
is what I thought I was running for.
It is time for Leader MCCONNELL to
bring up gun safety legislation—well

past time to bring up gun safety legis-
lation—and for us to act and do some-
thing about gun violence in this coun-
try.
Yes, we hope the President will lead,
will provide that leadership that we
hear about after every one of these
mass shootings—that the President is
engaged. We need his leadership to
bring us together on sensible gun safe-
ty legislation, but if not, we still have
the responsibility here in this body to
act. We call upon Leader MCCONNELL to
bring forward sensible gun safety legis-
lation.
The United States is an outlier on
gun violence. When you compare the
amount of gun violence in the United
States to that in the other developed
countries of the world, in every cat-
egory, multiply it times 10, 20, or 30—
more likely for gun violence episodes
here in the United States than other
developed countries of the world.
We have far more private ownership
of guns in this country than other in-
dustrial nations of the world. We have
far more mass killings. We have far
more gun-related suicides, and the list
goes on and on and on.
So we need to take action. This is
one area where we don’t want to be the
outlier. We want safe communities, and
inaction is not an answer.
Yes, there are many things we could
do. Look, the people of Maryland and
the people throughout this country
have been victims of this gun violence.
In my own State of Maryland, we had a
mass shooting in June of last year at
the Capital Gazette—outrageous. Peo-
ple trying to do their jobs were killed.
We have had, of course, school shoot-
ings. It is time for this Congress to
take steps to reduce this risk. Inaction
is not an option.
What should we do? As my previous
colleague said, there are a lot of things
we should be doing. We should take a
look at whether it is reasonable for
there to be private ownership of mili-
tary-style weapons. I think there
shouldn’t be. That is certainly a bill we
can bring up.
We have seen these assault weapons
used in a lot of mass attacks, where
you have multiple casualties in a mat-
ter of seconds, where there is no possi-
bility for law enforcement to respond
to keep people safe during that short
period of time.
We should get rid of the high-capac-
ity magazines. I know the House is
working on that. That is something
that, again, is not necessary for the
purposes of recreation.
We should identify extreme-risk indi-
viduals and be able to put a flag on
their ability to purchase a weapon. We
need to invest in mental health. All of
that is important.
The bill we can pass today is a uni-
versal background check. The House
has passed it. It has been here since
February of this year. For 7 months,
that bill has been here—universal
background checks. It was passed with
a strong bipartisan vote in the House
of Representatives and is consistent
with the Second Amendment. The Su-
preme Court has said the right is not
absolute, that certain individuals are
not entitled to have firearms because
of what they have done.
Since 1968, we have provided forms to
determine whether individuals are en-
titled to own a firearm or not. Of
course, in 1993, we passed the presale
process for licensed dealers because
that is where guns were being pur-
chased back in 1993. So if you buy a gun
from a licensed firearms dealer, you
have to go through the National In-
stant Criminal Background Check Sys-
tem. As my colleague has said, it takes
a matter of seconds. You can get
cleared or not cleared, and it works.
Three million guns have been denied a
transfer as a result of this check, but
there are loopholes in it because of the
way commerce is handled today. It
doesn’t cover private sales. Internet
sales weren’t even available back when
we passed these laws. We have to close
those loopholes, and it will save lives.
States that have closed these loopholes
have a lower amount of gun violence
than those States that have not.
We need a national answer to this. A
person from Maryland can go into Vir-
ginia or West Virginia where the laws
are different. We need one Federal law
to deal with closing this loophole.
Today and every day in this country
100 people are killed through gun vio-
lence—every single day. We can’t wait.
We have to act. That is what this body
is best at.
So I encourage President Trump to
lead on this issue. I know he had some
meetings this week. I encourage our
leader to allow this body to take up the
universal background check bill that
passed the House of Representatives by
a strong bipartisan vote. Let us get
that done. Let us tell the people of this
country that we will not be silent and
we will not be inactive in regard to the
amount of gun violence in this coun-
try.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York.
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I
rise to join my colleagues in discussing
our country’s horrific gun violence epi-
demic. I have risen to speak of this
problem many times over the years,
and to be honest it is exasperating to
have to do it over and over again.
El Paso, Dayton, Gilroy, Odessa, Mid-
land, Brownsville in New York—the
list goes on and on—city after city,
community after community, dev-
astated by gun violence. We witness
these tragedies. We watch heart-
breaking and nightmarish footage on
our televisions. We offer our thoughts
and prayers. We have heavy hearts,
deep disappointment and horror, and
still nothing. The Senate has still not
passed any meaningful legislation to
address the problem.
So here we are once again in this
Chamber. Democrats are speaking out
on behalf of the American people, on
behalf of the citizens who are pro-
testing and demanding action, and on
behalf of our constituents who call and
write and tweet to us every single day
for commonsense legislation to help
end this gun violence that plagues our
communities.
We aren’t just speaking out on behalf
of Democrats because gun violence
doesn’t ask what political party you
support. It touches the lives of every-
one in this country. The majority of
the American people—Democrats, Inde-
pendents, and Republicans—all want
action. They want their schools to be
safe. They want a place to go and wor-
ship and be safe. They want to go and
buy their back-to-school supplies and
be safe.
Let’s be really clear about the root of
this inaction. It is greed. It is corrup-
tion. It is the rot at the heart of Wash-
ington. The NRA is no different. The
NRA cares more about gun sales than
they do about the people of this coun-
try. They care more about the gun
manufacturers than they do our com-
munities. Too many of my colleagues
just don’t have the guts to stand up to
the NRA.
There are three effective solutions
sitting right in front of us, all of which
are bipartisan, all of which have been
voted on before, getting lots of bipar-
tisan support. I reject the false argu-
ment that because these commonsense
proposals may not stop every single in-
stance of gun violence that it is not
worth doing them. We should do these.
It makes no sense to stop doing the
commonsense things just because it
doesn’t stop every gun crime because
the truth is, it is time to do something.
We can and should ban assault weap-
ons and large magazines. No civilian
needs access to weapons of war. Those
weapons are designed solely to kill
large numbers of people very quickly,
in minutes and seconds, and our mili-
tary train heavily to be able to use
those weapons well.
We can and should pass my legisla-
tion to criminalize gun trafficking. It
will help slow the tide of illegal guns
into cities like New York and Chicago
and across the country where guns that
are illegal are sold directly out of the
back of a truck to a gang member or a
criminal. It is one of the things that
law enforcement keeps asking us to do
and have been asking for a decade.
We can and should pass the red flag
laws that are designed to make sure
people with violent tendencies cannot
have access to guns, but the first and
most obvious solution should be a
cakewalk for this Chamber, and that is
universal background checks. This so-
lution is supported by the vast major-
ity of Americans. A great bipartisan
bill has already passed our House, but
it is not even being considered right
now for a vote in the Senate.
So it is really on Senator MCCONNELL
right now. It is on him. It is his deci-
sion whether to protect our commu-
nities or not—to just protect our kids.

school, all I could think about was get-
ting there as fast as I possibly could
just to make sure my child was safe.
That is the fear every parent in Amer-
ica has today. We shouldn’t accept liv-
ing in an America where we have to
worry that our kids aren’t safe in
school, where they are actually doing
shelter-in-place drills instead of math-
ematical drills. We shouldn’t accept
that world. We shouldn’t accept a
world where you can’t be at Bible
study with your friends. We shouldn’t
accept a world where you can’t go to a
concert or go to a movie and know that
you are safe, but that is the world we
are living in.
The truth about all of this is, right
now at this moment, we have Ameri-
cans who are fueled by hate hunting
down other people with weapons of
war. That has to change.
We do have the will to do this. Con-
gress can show courage. Congress can
do the right thing, so why not do it
now, when the American people are
begging us to just have an ounce of
strength in our spines, just an ounce of
courage to stand up to special inter-
ests, to greed and corruption and lies
that distort this debate.
We are bigger than this. We are
stronger than this. We are better than
this. Let’s protect our kids.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania.
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to
speak about the same issue my col-
league from New York just spoke to,
and I know others have preceded her on
the floor. I am grateful to be a part of
this discussion today.
What I could do—but I know I don’t
have to because it is so well known
now—is go through the three or four
most recent mass shootings which are
the ones that get most attention, but I
don’t have to do that because we know
so well now what happened just in the
last number of weeks.
One way to remember them, of
course, is by the names of the commu-
nities: El Paso, Dayton, Midland, Odes-
sa—names like that where everyone in
the country knows exactly what we are
talking about because of what hap-
pened there. What we don’t talk about
enough, of course, are the places where
there is daily gun violence and horror
and tragedy and death and grievous in-
jury because it doesn’t get the same at-
tention.
Tragically, another way to go
through a list of tragedies that are
connected to this awful epidemic of
gun violence—this uniquely American
problem of gun violence—is to use
numbers. These numbers are now em-
blazoned on the communities that were
so tragically destroyed, in large meas-
ure, by these events. In El Paso it was
22, in Dayton it was 9, and in Midland
and Odessa it was 7. So doing the math,
that is 38. That is the number of people
killed in just three places. Of course,
there are a lot of other deaths between
those tragic events which aren’t get-
ting the same attention. That is an-
other way to measure—38 killed be-
tween August 3 and August 31. Another
number is the number of injured. I
think the number now is just about 76,
just in those three tragedies. So there
were 38 killed and 76 injured in three
American communities.
One of the most disturbing realities
after the fact is what happened in Day-
ton in just such a short timeframe. I
know that timeframe. We could prob-
ably cite the other tragedies as well,
but we know that in about 32 seconds
in Dayton, 9 people were killed and 27
were injured. Law enforcement, the
folks we often call the good guys—good
guys not just with guns but good guys
with a lot of training and a heroic will-
ingness and heroic commitment to get
to a place of danger to try to appre-
hend a criminal and to try to save peo-
ple. In Dayton, law enforcement offi-
cials got there faster than Superman
could get there, and it wasn’t fast
enough because in 32 seconds 9 were
gone and 27 were injured.
We know that in Midland and Odessa,
TX, the authorities reported that the
gunman was prohibited from pur-
chasing a firearm at one point, but he
was able to avoid a background check
because he purchased his assault-style
weapon through a private sale. This is
further evidence of why we need a
background check bill that is rig-
orous—not just a background check
bill that makes a nice headline but is
rigorous enough to stop the guy in
Texas who brought such horror to that
community, including, as one of the
wounded, a 17-month-old child.
We also know that through the
month of August, in that same time pe-
riod I mentioned, the 3rd to the 31st—
but if you include every day of that
month, the United States has experi-
enced 38 mass shootings. So there were
38 times when four or more people were
involved, which is the definition of a
mass shooting.
When I think about it in terms of the
scale of it—and I don’t think there is
anyone who would disagree with this—
this is a public health epidemic, and it
is plaguing our cities and our commu-
nities every single day. What we are
talking about, in terms of the perpetra-
tors of this violence, they are not just
criminals, they are domestic terrorists,
and we should call them that. That is
what they are. We shouldn’t try to re-
member their names or, frankly, even
speak their names, but we should re-
member what they are: domestic ter-
rorists who are, frankly, in terms of
the whole scale of the problem, causing
more problems in America than any
other terrorists are causing. These do-
mestic terrorists are using high-pow-
ered, military-style assault weapons to
kill our children and to kill our fami-
lies.
We know that last October, the most
deadly active violence against the Jew-
ish community in American history oc-
curred at the Tree of Life synagogue in
the city of Pittsburgh. Eleven were
killed there and six were injured, in-
cluding four of the six being law en-
forcement officers who, again, got
there very quickly—maybe not in sec-
onds but in minutes. Of course, getting
there that fast, with all of their train-
ing, all of their courage, and all of
their commitment, was not fast enough
because even though they got there in
just minutes, that wasn’t fast enough
because of the nature of the weapon
and because of the assailant.
How about Philadelphia? The two
biggest cities in my home State are
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Philadel-
phia being the largest. Days before the
horrible weekend of El Paso and Day-
ton, a mass shooting occurred in
Southwest Philadelphia that left a 21-
year-old dead and five others injured.
Because only one person was killed, it
is not ranked as a mass shooting. That
happened in that same timeframe.
On August 14, an individual in North
Philadelphia barricaded himself in a
house and shot six police officers with
an assault-style weapon. The shootout
lasted nearly 8 hours and prompted a
local childcare center to shelter in
place for hours. I was at that childcare
center just a few days later. Watching
it on the news, I had envisioned a geo-
graphic distance of a lot more than it
was. When I walked just to the side of
the building where the childcare center
was and looked across the street, it
was closer than the width of this room
we are in today. When you go out the
back door of the childcare center, it
was within feet across a very narrow
street from where the shooter was bar-
ricaded. In this instance, you have one
shooter in a house with a high-powered
weapon who is able to hold off a num-
ber of law enforcement officials for
hours at a time. That is just one exam-
ple of the power of the weapon.
The issue of gun violence is a unique-
ly American problem. No country has
the same problem on this scale. Amer-
ica has never had a problem like this in
its history. It is uniquely American
and unique in American history itself.
Some in Congress want to surrender
to this problem. The argument is that
there is nothing we can do except bet-
ter enforcement of existing law. I don’t
think most Americans believe that—
nor should they—because there is cer-
tainly more we can do. To have a posi-
tion that I would say is a surrender to
the problem, you would have to argue
that the most powerful Nation in the
history of the world can do absolutely
nothing—except maybe tighten up a
law by way of enforcement—that we
can do absolutely nothing to confront
this problem.
No one is arguing that if we passed a
background check bill here or an ex-
treme risk protection order bill that
somehow the problem would magically
begin to decline. No one is arguing
that. But there is certainly something
we can do to reduce the likelihood and
we would hope substantially reduce the
likelihood of more mass shootings. If
we passed two bills in the Senate that

became law and 25 years from now, one
mass shooting was prevented, it would
be worth every minute of that effort
and every degree of energy expended in
furtherance of passing that legislation.
We have been talking about this for a
long time just in the recent past. We
now know that it is more than 195 days
since the House passed H.R. 8, the Bi-
partisan Background Checks Act of
2019.
As I referred to earlier, in the Odes-
sa-Midland shooting, we know that our
Nation now needs a national back-
ground checks bill in order to make all
Americans safer from the horrors of
gun violence.
Reports indicate that in 2018 alone,
1.2 million firearm classified ads were
posted on armslist.com that did not re-
quire a background check before pur-
chase. This is a big loophole that helps
feed an illegal underground gun market
in cities and communities across our
country. If implemented, the universal
background checks bill known as H.R.
8 would close this loophole, requiring
background checks for all firearm sales
between private parties. We also know
that since 1994, background checks
have prevented 3.5 million gun sales to
dangerous criminals and others prohib-
ited from owning a gun.
I have to ask again, are we to sur-
render to this problem? I don’t think
so. I think most Americans don’t want
to surrender to it. What they want is
for us to take action. They are a little
bit tired of just speeches and debate.
They may want a little more debate,
but they want votes. They want us to
be debating and voting several times at
least, if not more so.
This is a grave, difficult challenge to
confront, but the commitment to con-
fronting it is a mission that I think is
worthy of a great country. I ask Major-
ity Leader MCCONNELL to give the Sen-
ate the opportunity to debate and vote
on first the universal background
checks bill, H.R. 8. And I am sure there
will be other versions of that in the de-
bate, and that is fine. We should debate
all of them and vote on all of them and
debate and vote on an extreme risk
protection bill.
I would argue we should do more
than that. We should have a series of
commonsense gun measures to be de-
bated and voted on, even if we are like-
ly to know the outcome, because the
American people expect that this
uniquely American problem and the
scale of it are worthy of that debate
and worthy of those votes.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
PERDUE). The Senator from Virginia.
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I also rise
to talk about gun violence. I express
my appreciation for our Republican
colleagues. Those of us on this side of
the aisle feel very strongly about this
issue. I understand we have gone a lit-
tle bit past the time. I will try to be
quick. I feel very strongly about it too.
Let me just talk about two Virginia
tragedies, and let me tell the story of a
hero whose name we should all know.
It has been interesting. I sat on the
Senate floor and listened to a number
of my colleagues’ speeches. As they
talked about gun violence and mass
shooting in the United States, very few
have mentioned that 12 people were
killed in Virginia Beach in a mass
shooting on May 31. They mentioned
Odessa, they mentioned El Paso, and
they mentioned Dayton. Why not Vir-
ginia Beach? Because there have been
so many tragedies since May 31.
The Virginia Beach shooting of 11
governmental employees and a con-
tractor who was just there to get some
permits for a building permit he was
seeking happened barely 3 months ago,
but it has already receded into the
memory of virtually anybody outside
of Virginia because the gun tragedies
since have been the ones that have
crowded into our minds.
The fact that that has been allowed
to happen—that we are so used to it
now that the killing of 12 people in a
mass shooting barely 3 months ago es-
caped people’s memories—tells us we
have become used to a situation we
should never have been able to tol-
erate.
In the Virginia Beach shooting, one
of the reasons 12 people were killed
quickly was the shooter used high-ca-
pacity magazines that would contain
dozens and dozens of munition, which
made the rescue operation conducted
by brave first responders extremely dif-
ficult.
We say we care about our first re-
sponders. When I talk to our first re-
sponders, they say: If you care about
us, do something to restrict high-ca-
pacity magazines. Don’t you want us to
be able to stop a shooting in progress?
Don’t you want us to stop a murder
and keep the homicides and carnage
down? It is hard to do it when we are
up against somebody with such a mas-
sive amount of firepower. If you care
about first responders, if you want us
to stop crimes in process, then enable
us to put meaningful restrictions on
high-capacity magazines.
I think that was a powerful lesson
from the Virginia Beach shooting, that
had the magazines been smaller, they
could have stopped the carnage earlier.
There may have been those injured or
killed, but it would have been less of a
toll.
I want to point this out before mov-
ing to the next issue. As a society, we
tolerate high-capacity magazines.
Many in this Chamber are hunters.
Many in this Chamber are familiar
with hunting laws. In Virginia, as in
most States, there are rules that have
been on the books for years. If you
hunt a deer in Virginia, we limit the
amount of rounds you can have in a
rifle or shotgun. We put a limit, and
that limit has been accepted for dec-
ades. Why do we limit the size of maga-
zines in hunting animals? Because it
wouldn’t be fair. It wouldn’t be sports-
manlike. It wouldn’t be humane to
allow an animal to be hunted with a
magazine of near-unlimited capacity. If
it is not humane to hunt an animal
with a massive magazine, then why
allow near-unlimited magazines to be
used to hunt human beings? This is a
rule we accept, and we should accept it
for weapons designed to hurt humans
as well.
The second tragedy in Virginia oc-
curred when I was Governor a number
of years ago—the tragic shooting at
Virginia Tech. I won’t go into it be-
cause I will segue when I talk about a
hero, but the shooting at Virginia Tech
happened because of a weakness in the
background check system. The indi-
vidual, the young man, Seung-Hui Cho,
who killed 32 people was prohibited
from having a weapon because he had
been adjudicated mentally ill and dan-
gerous, but weaknesses in the back-
ground checks system enabled him to
get a weapon anyway. We learned a
powerful and painful lesson that day,
which is that if your background check
system has loopholes and gaps, disas-
ters will result.
So I join with my colleagues who say
H.R. 8—that has come from the House
and is a comprehensive background
check system bill that keeps weapons
out of the hands of people who are dan-
gers to themselves and others—is
something we should absolutely pass.
Last, let me tell the story about an
American hero. I have told this story
on the floor before but not for a num-
ber of years. I want to tell this story
because I think everybody should know
this individual’s name. The name of
the hero I want to describe is a man
named Liviu Librescu.
Liviu Librescu was one of the 32 peo-
ple who were killed at Virginia Tech on
April 16, 2007. Let me tell you about
him. He was born in Romania—and he
was Jewish—during the Holocaust.
When Germany occupied Romania and
began to take over the country, Jews
were persecuted. Liviu Librescu was
then a young child. His family was sent
to concentration camps, and many of
them perished just because they were
Jewish. Liviu, as a young child, was
hidden by relatives and friends and mi-
raculously managed to survive the Nazi
campaign of anti-Semitism against
Jews. Many Jews left Romania because
they felt their neighbors and friends
didn’t protect them. Liviu Librescu de-
cided to stay. ‘‘I am a Romanian and
am going to stay in Romania and make
my country a peaceful place where
Jews can live in peace with their fellow
men and women.’’
He ran into a second problem. He
went to the university. He was a tal-
ented scientist and engineer. But then
the Soviet Union moved in and essen-
tially occupied Romania. They pun-
ished him because he was Jewish and
because he wouldn’t join the Com-
munist Party. He was a world-re-
nowned engineer published in journals
around the world. First, they prohib-
ited his ability to travel to academic
conferences and then prohibited his
right to publish. Over the years, the

Soviet-dominated Government of Ro-
mania took away virtually every right
he had.
He started to try to figure out a way
to immigrate to Israel. In the early
1970s, at a time when some Eastern Eu-
ropean Jews were allowed to immigrate
to Israel, Liviu Librescu finally es-
caped Soviet-dominated communism
after having survived the Holocaust
and moved to Israel. It was his dream.
Liviu Librescu was teaching at the
Technion in Israel, one of the premier
scientific engineering institutions in
the world. He got an offer after a few
years to come be a visiting professor in
Blacksburg, VA, at Virginia Tech for 1
year. He came in 1958. This Romanian
Jew, professor at an Israeli technical
university, came to Blacksburg, VA, in
the mountains of Appalachia, for 1
year, and he fell in love with
Blacksburg. He stayed in Blacksburg,
at Virginia Tech, for the rest of his ca-
reer.
On April 16, 2007, Liviu Librescu—
now 22 years in Blacksburg—was teach-
ing an engineering class in one of the
two buildings that were the subject of
the attack by the shooter, Seung-Hui
Cho. On the morning of April 16, 2007,
he had undergraduates and graduates
in the class. When he heard shooting
start in the classroom, he instinctively
knew he should protect his students.
Liviu Librescu was now over 70 years
old, this Holocaust survivor.
He stood in front of the classroom
door on the second floor of this build-
ing and told the students: You have to
jump out the window. I am going to do
everything I can to protect your life.
Jump out the window.
He stood there in front of the class-
room door and absorbed bullet after
bullet. Every student of Liviu
Librescu’s was able to escape from that
building, save one. There was one stu-
dent who couldn’t get out in time and
who had let others go first. Liviu
Librescu was killed, and one student in
his class was killed, but he saved the
lives of all of these other young people.
April 16, 2007, was a day that was a
very special day in Liviu Librescu’s
life. Most in the classroom wouldn’t
have known it. That day was Yom
HaShoah, which is a day that occurs
every year on the Hebrew calendar and
is a day that is celebrated and com-
memorated in Israel. It is a day to
commemorate, remember, and never
forget the Holocaust. That is what
Yom HaShoah was. Liviu Librescu, a
Holocaust survivor, knew what that
day was. He knew what it meant. He
made a choice.
The commemoration of the Holo-
caust is not just about remembering
the violent perpetrators and is not just
about remembering the victims; it is
also about remembering that there
wouldn’t have been millions of victims
had there not been so many bystand-
ers. That is what Yom HaShoah is
about. It is about victims, perpetra-
tors, and also about bystanders in that
the Holocaust would never have hap-
pened had there not been so many by-
standers. What Liviu Librescu decided
to do that day was not to be a by-
stander. As violence was occurring
around him, he decided: I will not be a
bystander. I will try to take an action
to save someone’s life.
Think about it. He survived the Holo-
caust. Think about it. He survived the
Soviet takeover of his country. Then
he came to this Nation and loved it,
but he could not survive the carnage of
American gun violence. He did, at
least, decide he wouldn’t be a by-
stander.
That is what we are called to do in
the Senate of the United States—not to
be bystanders. We do not have to dem-
onstrate the courage of a Liviu
Librescu and place our bodies in front
of a classroom door and absorb bullet
after bullet to save somebody else’s
life. I don’t think I would have the
courage to do that. I don’t know how
many of us would have. We are not
called to make a sacrifice of that mag-
nitude, but I do think we are called to
make some sacrifices, and I do think
we are called not to be bystanders. If
we are going to be true to that calling,
we have to be willing to take up and
debate and to vote on commonsense
measures to keep Americans safe from
gun violence.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana.
REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11TH
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise to
honor those who lost their lives trag-
ically 18 years ago and to make sure
that we never forget what happened
then.
I vividly remember that morning. I
was in my own office in Jasper, IN. I
didn’t have a TV. Somebody there
brought it up on the internet. The sec-
ond plane flew into the building. I will
never forget that image because we
didn’t know what had happened with
the first one. We knew what had hap-
pened with the second.
Over the summer break, Senator
RICK SCOTT and I took a trip to Israel
and saw all of that which goes into its
preparedness against the evil that
lurks around the world. I saw it again
up close, and it always makes me won-
der: How can they live like that? How
can they be prepared when they know
there are always individuals and coun-
tries out there just like in 1941 and just
like in 2001? Imagine living in a coun-
try in which your entire border is sur-
rounded by a fence or a wall in order to
keep people out—where, in the tough
places, there is another barrier and
where, in the really tough places, there
is a dirt berm.
That drove home again how impor-
tant it is to be prepared and to always
be strong when it comes to defending
this country and the liberty and free-
doms we all enjoy every day. I never
thought it could happen in 1941, and I
didn’t think it could happen in 2001. It
can happen again because that is the
world we live in.
When I came here as a U.S. Senator,
I always knew the most important
thing this body should do was foster
the defense and the security of this
country. When you see it has slipped so
precariously over the last few years—
and thank goodness that we have built
it back up to a level that makes
sense—it is because we always need to
be prepared. If we are going to truly
honor all of the lives that were lost in
1941 and 2001 and will be inevitably lost
down the road, we need to be strong; we
need to be prepared. We always need to
be aware of the fact that we are blessed
just as the State of Israel is blessed—
despite all of that—with a thriving
economy. They live with that danger
every day, and they find a way to get
through it. Let us never let our guard
down or drop our defenses here. Our
freedom and our liberty depend upon it.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri.
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, as my
friend from Indiana and others have
pointed out today, this is a day that
Americans remember as a day of
unique tragedy. Earlier today, on the
Senate floor, we had a moment of si-
lence in the middle of a series of votes.
The Senate floor was full of Members
who paused to think about what had
happened on that day.
I think almost every American alive
knows where he was that morning.
Just like this morning, it was beautiful
and clear. If you were too young to re-
member where you were that morn-
ing—and there is a real likelihood that
your parents told you where you were—
it was a seminal moment. It changed
how we look at so many things in our
country. We reflect today where we
were and the changes that occurred
after that.
I was working on the other side of
the building as a Member of the House
18 years ago, and I shared with the Cap-
itol Police today my appreciation for
what they do every day. On this day
every year, I remember being one of
the last people to leave this building.
The Capitol Police were working hard
to get people out as there was a sense
that a plane was coming here and was
going to either hit the White House or
the Capitol. I remember walking out
the door—I really was among the last
to leave the building that day—and I
remember looking into the eyes of a
Capitol Police Officer who was still at
the door and thinking and realizing
that I was going to be out. If the build-
ing were a target, I was quickly going
to be somewhere else, and she was still
going to be here until those who work
to protect us every day were sure that
everybody who could possibly be found
and gotten out of the building was al-
ready gone.
We clearly understand the world is a
dangerous place. We just had a foreign
policy discussion this week about the
country that had served as really the
haven for al-Qaida and what would hap-
pen if we were to totally leave that

country and it were to go back to the
Taliban. Would it become a haven
again? Almost certainly, I think it
would.
We really need to think about a num-
ber of things. One is that so many peo-
ple do so much to protect us all the
time. We have thousands of Americans
who are in uniform and in the intel-
ligence community who spend their
time every day being sure that we are
as safe as we can be and that our free-
doms are secure. They are deployed
overseas. They are fighting terrorist
groups like ISIS or the remnants of al-
Qaida. They are working here to spot
homegrown terrorists. They are doing
what they can to find what somebody
may be talking about or what some-
body may be bringing across the border
that would be of danger.
Senator CAPITO and I were just at the
border last week. Some of the things
we talked about were not only the
drugs coming over the border but the
other things coming over the border
that are designed to harm us—who we
are and how we live.
In St. Louis, MO, and Arnold, MO, we
have the second biggest installation of
the National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency constantly looking at the in-
formation that is out there. It looks all
over the world to see if there is activ-
ity in places in which there wouldn’t be
activity. Yet, if there were activity, it
would likely be activity that would be
designed to harm us or others in the
world. We need to understand that.
We also need to understand that in
the society in which we live, there is
never perfect security and perfect free-
dom at the same time. We have worked
really hard not to allow ourselves to
lose the freedoms we cherish in return
for the security we would like to have.
We also need to remember those peo-
ple who responded. As for the first re-
sponders who ran toward the tragedy
on 9/11 as others were able to run away
from the tragedy—passing each other—
many of those first responders were
numbered among the 3,000 Americans
who died on that day.
Just last month, the President signed
into law the National Urban Search
and Rescue Parity Act, which allows
Federal employees to be active partici-
pants on urban search and rescue
teams whether the disaster is natural
or man-made.
The third thing we need to keep in
mind is how important it is to honor
and care for the victims and heroes
among us—those who ran toward the
tragedy, those they left behind, and the
people who still suffer today because of
what happened to them on that day. As
likely as not, those people to benefit
from the Victim Compensation Fund
are the people who stayed behind to
help others or who rushed forward to
help others.
We don’t want to become afraid to be
the great, diverse society we have be-
come; we don’t want to become a soci-
ety in which we allow the terrorists to
win by taking our freedoms away. Yet
this is an important time for us to
think of those freedoms, of those who
defend those freedoms, of those who
rush to the scenes of danger when we
have danger, and of those who try to do
everything they can to minimize that.
We grieve, we pray, we remember,
and we resolve today that we will con-
tinue to be vigilant against attack and
unafraid of defending who we are.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the vote series
begin following the remarks of Sen-
ators DAINES, COLLINS, LANKFORD, and
COTTON.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11TH
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, 18 years
ago, on a bright, clear-skied, Sep-
tember morning, without warning, our
Nation was attacked. Many of us prob-
ably remember where we were on that
horrible day.
I had that morning off. I was at home
with my nearly 2-year-old daughter.
We didn’t have the TV on. We had a
couple of gentlemen at the house. I was
getting a brandnew furnace on that
day. What would normally be a couple-
of-hours-long installation turned into
an all-day event as those men would
take time off from installing our new
furnace to run into the other room so
we could see what was going on on the
television.
I had two phone calls that morning.
The first was early. It was from a
neighbor.
She said: JONI, do you have the TV
on?
I said: Well, no, Wanda. I don’t.
What’s going on?
She said: JONI, you just need to turn
the TV on.
So I did, and I saw the horrible
events unfolding right in front of us.
The second phone call I got was from
my Iowa Army National Guard unit:
Captain ERNST, we are doing a 100-per-
cent accountability check. We need
you to stay by the phone all day so we
know how we can get ahold of you—100
percent accountability.
It was an experience many of us had
never felt before—the terrifying shock
of knowing that the country we love
and our fellow Americans were under
attack.
Our adversaries sought to tear us
apart by their cowardly acts, but, in-
stead, they brought us together as
Americans, for in those terrible mo-
ments, we also saw the very, very best
of our country—the firefighters, the
police officers, the first responders, and
the ordinary citizens who courageously
put their lives on the line to save
countless others.
On that day, as individuals and as a
Nation, we came together in a unique
way, and we also made a pledge to
never forget—to never forget the near-
ly 3,000 victims and the families they
left behind, to never forget the heroism
of both our first responders and those
everyday men and women who self-
lessly acted to save lives, and to never
forget the importance of defending our
homeland and the great democratic
principles that we stand for.
It is a pledge I personally take very
seriously, and it is why I have orga-
nized this event for my colleagues to
come to the floor today and to share
their memories and thoughts on today,
this eighteenth anniversary of the Sep-
tember 11th terrorist attacks.
It is why I work so hard to make sure
our Armed Forces have the technology,
support, and resources they need to de-
fend our Nation from threats both here
at home and abroad.
It is why I cosponsored and helped to
finally get signed into law a permanent
reauthorization of the September 11th
Victim Compensation Fund, keeping
our Nation’s promise to support the
first responders who continue to sac-
rifice their health and even their lives
from their work in the post-9/11 recov-
ery efforts.
And it is why we should never ever
take our Nation and our freedoms for
granted.
I am one—just one—of the millions of
Americans keeping that promise to
never forget. In fact, today, back home
in Iowa, there are countless folks who
are honoring that vow in their own
thoughtful way.
Many use today’s anniversary as a
day of service, performing acts of kind-
ness throughout Iowa. Others come to-
gether with their communities to
honor and remember those who were
lost.
It is really wonderful to see all of the
ways that folks are doing that, from
walking in the 9/11 March to the Cap-
itol in Des Moines to visiting the 9/11
Never Forget Mobile Exhibit, currently
at the Clay County Fair, to partici-
pating in the annual 9/11 Moment of Si-
lence Motorcycle Ride in Mason City.
For some of our fellow Iowans, today
will be spent remembering loved ones
lost in the attack—folks like Newton’s
Jean Cleere’s husband, Jim, a loving,
good-natured, good-humored, and God-
fearing giant of a man, who never came
home from a fateful business trip to
the World Trade Center 18 years ago.
For nearly two decades now, Jean has
been on a crusade to keep Jim’s mem-
ory alive and well. She helped to raise
funds for Newton’s very own 9/11 me-
morial. She speaks to local students,
educating them about the events of
that day 18 years ago, and she has
given her testimony all over Iowa. For
folks in Iowa, they have probably seen
her driving across the State. She has a
pretty special license plate, which
reads ‘‘NVR4GT’’—never forget.
Today and every day, Iowans are
keeping that sacred promise. We will
always remember Jim Cleere and the
nearly 3,000 others who lost their lives
that tragic day. We will always honor
the heroes who selflessly sacrificed and
saved countless lives. We will always

rise up to defend our Nation and its
citizens. We will never forget. That is
our sacred promise.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana.
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, 18 years
ago today, Americans witnessed what
evil looks like. Eighteen years ago
today, Americans witnessed the loss of
innocent life. Eighteen years ago
today, Americans witnessed acts of
cowardice.
Today, Montanans and Americans
across our country are taking time to
reflect upon the horrific acts of 9/11.
Today, we take time to remember the
thousands of lives lost on that horrible
day. We remember the daughters who
lost mothers, the sons who lost fathers,
and the loved ones and friends and the
communities that were broken by
these tragedies.
I know I speak for most of us when I
say that we remember that day like it
was yesterday. That fateful morning, I
was in Bozeman, MT. I typically like to
get an earlier start at work. We are 2
hours behind eastern time. So it was
early in the morning.
My wife Cindy called me. I was at my
desk. I was working for a cloud-com-
puting software company, just starting
the day, and Cindy called me. She said:
There is really strange news. There has
been a plane that hit one of the World
Trade Center towers.
I think many of us at that time
thought it was maybe a small, private
plane—sort of, kind of a strange bit of
news coming out that morning. Then,
as the minutes went by, we started
finding out what was really going on,
that it wasn’t a small plane. It wasn’t
an accident. It was a 767 loaded with
fuel because it was attempting to make
a journey across our country from Bos-
ton out to the west coast.
The images of the planes crashing
into the Twin Towers is one I will
never forget, and it is one that will
never stop hurting. I remember that
after it was confirmed that it was a
commercial aircraft, very quickly the
speculation began that this was a pre-
meditated terror attack. In moments
like that you want to be with your
loved ones. I quietly closed the door to
my office, and I drove home to be with
my wife and to be with family as we
watched the rest of the horrible day
unfold: 2,977 innocent Americans lost
their lives, and 2,977 innocent Ameri-
cans didn’t return home that day.
I think it is important to think
about every single human life that was
lost and the pain of the families who
remember that day today when they
lost their loved ones. That pain is very
real yet again today.
This was a slaughter of our fellow
Americans that shook our Nation to its
very core. Yet, in the face of extreme
adversity, we are a nation that did
come together and we carried on. I
think about those moments when our
churches and cathedrals were filled
with Americans in prayer, reflecting
upon what had happened.
Today, we honor and remember the
almost 3,000 people who died that Sep-
tember morning. We remember the sur-
vivors, those first responders, the fire-
fighters, and the friends and families of
those we lost. While we take the time
to remember today, we also reflect on
who we are as a nation. As Americans,
we are strong and resilient. After the 9/
11 attacks, we responded with strength
and we strengthened the homeland.
We are most grateful to those who
served and to those who are serving
today in our Armed Forces. Just re-
cently, last December, I flew to Af-
ghanistan. In fact, we carried 50 pounds
of Montana beef jerky to deliver to the
495th Combat Sustainment Support
Battalion of the Montana Army Na-
tional Guard, who are deployed over in
Afghanistan protecting us. As I re-
ceived the briefs that day, I was re-
minded yet again that this war that we
have against terrorism exists this very
moment, and I can tell you this be-
cause of the men and women who serve
in our Armed Forces, in intelligence,
and in law enforcement across our Na-
tion. It is because of them that we are
able to stand here today without an-
other terror attack like we saw on 9/11.
When I received the brief in Afghani-
stan in December, I was reminded
again of the porous border between Af-
ghanistan and Pakistan and that there
are plots being created and attempts to
hit the homeland again. There are
many brave men and women there,
many Special Forces.
I spent time with the four-star there,
Scott Miller, who has had a career in
Special Forces. He is overseeing the op-
erations there. I am grateful that they
continue to remain vigilant in this
fight against global terrorism.
America’s enemies want us to be
afraid, but the thing is, here in Amer-
ica, we don’t give up. When America is
strong, so are our allies and so is the
free world. We must remain vigilant to
ensure that we maintain that Reagan
doctrine of peace through strength.
The world will never forget what hap-
pened on this day 18 years ago, and de-
spite the political differences and divi-
sions that we have across our country
and this city, we must always remem-
ber that we are all in this together, and
Americans are strong when we are
united.
There is no force of evil or terror
that will ever overcome the will and
the determination of a free and united
people.
We ask that God continue to bless
our fighting men and women, and may
God continue to bless the United
States of America.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas.
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, Sep-
tember 11 is a solemn anniversary.
Eighteen years later, we still remem-
ber the toll from that terrible day.
Nearly 3,000 Americans lost their lives
in the attacks on the Twin Towers, the
Pentagon, and United Flight 93, but
every American experienced the pain of
loss that day.
Just as we mourn the innocent lives
lost, we also remember the heroism of
our first responders who ran toward
danger and death to help their fellow
Americans.
Out of the ashes of that terrible trag-
edy arose a strength and unity that the
whole world came to admire. Sep-
tember 11 altered the course of our Na-
tion’s history in a blaze of fire and
smoke, and for so many Americans, it
altered the course of our lives.
Our fighting men and women de-
ployed overseas just weeks later and
remain in the fight today. So many
Americans joined them, enlisting to
defend our Nation. Young kids who
witnessed firefighters rushing into the
burning towers grew up and themselves
joined units with old-fashioned names
like ‘‘engine’’ and ‘‘ladder.’’ A genera-
tion of intelligence officers dedicated
themselves to preventing another 9/11,
and they have and still do.
Our lives continue to be altered be-
cause the consequences of September 11
are still with us. The attacks of 18
years ago continue to claim new vic-
tims, as first responders and others
succumb to injuries and illnesses that
trace back to that morning.
The al-Qaida terrorists who attacked
us are bloodied, yet undefeated, while
the Taliban terrorists who gave safe
haven threaten to regain control in Af-
ghanistan.
Most tragic of all, our brave soldiers,
sailors, airmen, and marines continue
to fall in the line of duty and defense of
our country.
Just last week, Army SFC Elis A.
Barreto Ortiz was killed on the battle-
field in Afghanistan. September 11 is
his story, too—the story of valor and
sacrifice.
So the story of September 11 con-
tinues to unfold many years after the
fact. May its memory strengthen our
resolve to continue fighting the en-
emies of freedom, and may we never
ever forget.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma.
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, 18
years ago today, in my office in Okla-
homa City, a fellow staff member
poked her head into the office and said
to me: There is a freak accident that
has happened in New York. A plane
flew into the World Trade Center.
She went down the hallway and
pulled in a rolling cart—the younger
generation will have no idea what that
is—but a rolling cart with a TV on top
of it, and we plugged it in and watched
it. As the second plane flew in, both of
us stood there silently, thinking: That
is no accident. That is murder on a
massive scale and terror like I have
never witnessed with my own eyes.
What I didn’t know at that moment
is how many thousands of lives would
be affected and how much our Nation
would be changed. That morning, 18
years ago, seven Oklahomans died, but

September 11, 2019
our Nation was forever changed. Com-
mon terms we think about today like
‘‘TSA,’’ or ‘‘terror watch list,’’ or ‘‘De-
partment of Homeland Security,’’ or
‘‘Global Entry,’’ or ‘‘body scanners,’’ or
‘‘PATRIOT Act’’—those didn’t exist on
September 10, 2001. They have all come
since then as our Nation learns how to
do more security, learns how to en-
gage, and has learned a painful lesson
that what people think in an isolated
village in a remote country—what they
think matters to us because what they
may carry out, if left alone and ig-
nored, could kill our family members
and our fellow Americans.
Almost 3,000 Americans died that
day, but since that time period, we
have pushed back not against the peo-
ple of Afghanistan or the people of
Iraq, not against Muslims or a faith
but against a specific ideology that in-
tensely hates the freedom of America
and who intentionally plans to kill
Americans they have never met.
We learned a new ideology as a na-
tion that day; that we have to not only
take it seriously but that we must not
wait until they carry out a fight. If
they are planning it, if they are pre-
paring it, if they have the capability,
we should assume they are actually
going to do it.
Since that time period, American
men and women have taken the fight
to people who want to come and kill
more Americans, but it has also been
at a great cost of American blood and
treasure: 4,432 Americans have died in
Iraq; 2,353 Americans have died in Af-
ghanistan. Fifty-one of those are my
fellow Oklahomans in Afghanistan; 72
of those are my fellow Oklahomans in
Iraq.
Today, I pulled out of my closet a
specific tie that I rarely wear. It was a
tie given to me by a Gold Star Wife
who never ever wanted to be a Gold
Star Wife. She just wanted to be the
wife of Chris Horton, whom she in-
tensely loved, who went to Afghanistan
to serve his country in the Oklahoma
National Guard and died for our free-
dom. Two years later, she handed me
this tie and said: He hated wearing
ties, but you have to wear them all the
time. Just remember him.
We, as Americans, will not forget,
and we have not forgotten. There are
flags out all over America today just to
remember. There are moms and dads
who really hugged their kids tight this
morning before they left for school,
and the kids didn’t even know why.
They just did. There are places where
people are gathering to pray for peace
because as a nation we are a nation of
peace, and we have no desire for war. In
fact, we detest the pain and penalty
and blood and loss of war, and we have
no desire to be at war across the world,
but it came to us, and we look forward
to the day when guns are silent again
and this finally concludes and a time of
peace can be restored again.
Today, though, we are just a nation
remembering and praying for that time
of peace that will come, and we are
telling Gold Star families and families
who have sent their loved ones around
the world to places they had never seen
before: We have not forgotten, and we
are grateful that we serve together as a
nation.
I yield back.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me
say at the outset, I join with the senti-
ments expressed by the Senator from
Oklahoma and our colleagues on the
floor, starting with a moment of si-
lence until this last speech, in remem-
bering the historic American signifi-
cance of September 11.
The fact that both political parties
came together shows there is hope that
when it comes to this Nation and its
values, what brings us together is a
powerful force. Today it is the force of
memory, the force of promise, and the
force of the future of this country. I
want to salute my colleagues, particu-
larly my friend from Oklahoma for his
moving statement about families in his
State touched by this tragedy.
E-CIGARETTES
Mr. President, I would like to change
topics for just a moment to another
important issue that has risen today
and I believe is worthy of comment.
Just a few hours ago, the White
House, the President, the First Lady,
the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, and the Commissioner of the
Food and Drug Administration made a
historic announcement when it comes
to vaping and e-cigarettes.
They just finished the 2019 National
Youth Tobacco Survey. What they
have found is that in a 1-year period of
time, the number of our kids who are
using these vaping products and e-ciga-
rette products has gone up from 20 per-
cent to 27.5 percent. In the previous
year, it had gone up by 80 percent, and
it is continuing to skyrocket because it
is an addiction which is so popular
with children.
Our kids don’t know any better. They
are being told by JUUL and other com-
panies that somehow this vaping is
really a healthy alternative to tobacco
cigarettes. That has yet to be proven,
and the Food and Drug Administration
challenged JUUL and the other compa-
nies to come up with clinical proof of
that statement before they repeat it
again and again and again.
In the course of the last several
years, the sale of these e-cigarettes and
vaping products has mushroomed dra-
matically in the United States. Just
ask any school principal, teacher, and
many parents, and they will tell you
what is happening. Kids don’t under-
stand that these flavors they are buy-
ing—flavor pods like Unicorn Milk,
Gummy Bears, Bubble Gum—sound
like some sweet candy treat, but when
you inhale it into your lungs, you run
the risk of real damage.
So far, over 450 American kids have
been admitted to hospitals because of
lung problems from vaping. Six have
died. These young people do not under-
stand how risky this is.
Have you walked down the street and
seen somebody with a big cloud of
white smoke over their head as they
exhale from one of these vaping de-
vices? They don’t realize that what
they are ingesting in their lungs could
be deadly.
The Food and Drug Administration
and the Secretary of Health and
Human Services made an announce-
ment today that is significant. They
announced that the e-cigarette device
and flavors that are now being sold are
going to be taken off the market, out
of retail stores, off of online sales.
Then, come May of next year, those
who want to bring these flavors back
have to justify them as being con-
sistent with being good for public
health.
I ask that the RECORD note that Sen-
ator MURKOWSKI and I have joined in a
bill we introduced last year, a bill
which went after these flavor pods. I
want to thank her. There weren’t a lot
of Senators who were willing to step
up, and she did. On a bipartisan basis,
we set out to ban any of these flavor
pods that were dangerous to children
and couldn’t be proven to be harmless.
I thank her for that leadership. I be-
lieve our legislation and our constant
pressure on this administration came
to this moment today where we are
stepping forward.
We are making it clear in the United
States of America that we know vaping
targets kids. We know these targeted
kids are risking their health and their
life by continuing to use e-cigarettes
and vaping. With this administration
today, on a bipartisan basis, we are
banning these flavor pods once and for
all. We are going to try to move for-
ward.
The last thing I will say is this: I
hope the Surgeon General or one of the
other leaders in public health in our
government will step up now and no-
tify every school principal in America
to call an assembly, to gather the par-
ents, and let them know about this
danger. There are 5 million kids in this
country vaping today. Let’s hope they
can stop, and stop soon, before they
harm themselves.
I salute the administration for its
leadership on this matter. I worked on
it for quite a few years. It is a good mo-
ment in our history that we are mov-
ing together on a bipartisan basis.
I yield the floor.

TON). The Senator from Maine.
REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11TH
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, earlier
today we paused and commemorated
those who lost their lives on September
11, 2001.
Eighteen years have passed, but the
memory of that day remains as vivid as
if it were yesterday. We each have our
own recollections of where we were and
what we were doing as the horrifying
terrorist attacks on our country began
to unfold.
I remember having the television on
and watching a report that a plane—

originally reported as a small plane—
had struck one of the Twin Towers. I
then shortly thereafter saw the second
aircraft strike the World Trade Center.
It was then that I knew our country
was under attack. I told my staff to
stay away from the Capitol Building
because I feared it, too, could be a tar-
get.
Today, we all still share the powerful
emotions of shock, anger, and grief. I
was worried about not only my staff,
those in the buildings, but also staff
members who were on their way back
from Portland, ME, which turns out to
be where some of the terrorists began
their journey of death and destruction
that day.
On the evening of that terrible day,
Members of Congress gathered together
on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. With
tears in our eyes and sorrow in our
hearts, together we sang ‘‘God Bless
America.’’ The emotions of shock,
anger, and grief were joined by unity,
resolve, and patriotism. That sense
that swept over us as we sang was a
source of strength in the challenges
that we faced in the fight against ter-
rorism.
So many were killed that horrific
day. In my State of Maine, we remem-
ber Robert and Jackie Norton of Lubec,
a devoted retired couple who boarded
Flight 11 to celebrate a son’s wedding
on the west coast. We remember James
Roux of Portland, an Army veteran and
a devoted father, who was on his way
to a business meeting in California. We
remember Robert Schlegel of Gray,
who was celebrating his recent pro-
motion to the rank of commander in
the U.S. Navy and was still settling
into his new office at the Pentagon
when the plane struck. We remember
Stephen Ward of Gorham, who was
working on the 101st floor of the North
Tower that terrible morning.
On this solemn anniversary, we join
all Americans in remembering the
nearly 3,000 people who lost their lives
that day—lives of accomplishment,
contribution, and promise. Each loss
leaves a wound in the hearts of families
and friends that can never be fully
healed.
We honor the heroes of that day. We
are still moved by the selfless courage
of the men and women on Flight 93 who
wrestled that plane to the ground in
Pennsylvania, sacrificing their lives so
that others might live. We are inspired
by the firefighters, EMS personnel, and
police officers at the World Trade Cen-
ter who continued to climb upward to
rescue those who were in peril even as
the Twin Towers were tumbling down.
The New York City Fire Department
alone lost 343 firefighters who re-
sponded to the attacks.
We pay tribute today and every day
to the first responders, the military
personnel, and the civilians who rushed
into the smoke and flames at the Pen-
tagon to lead others to safety.
We express our gratitude to those
who have given so much to defend our
Nation against terrorism, the men and
women of our Armed Forces.
While millions of Americans watched
in horror as the tragedy unfolded on
that terrible day, the thousands of cou-
rageous first responders who rushed to
the World Trade Center, who rushed to
that field in Pennsylvania, who rushed
to the Pentagon to help search for vic-
tims and to help bring anyone they
could to safety, still inspire us. They
put themselves in imminent danger to
save the lives of others.
Later on, years later, we learned that
the toxic dust and debris that many
were exposed to have caused chronic
illnesses. The overwhelmingly bipar-
tisan vote in the Senate in July to per-
manently reauthorize the 9/11 Victim
Compensation Fund ensures that those
first responders who risked their lives
to save their fellow Americans will al-
ways be supported and their illnesses
treated.
September 11 was a day of personal
tragedy for so many families. It was
also an attack on the United States of
America and an assault on civilization.
We must never forget what was lost
and what remains at stake. We must
continue our pledge—the pledge we
made that horrific day—to do all we
can to prevent future attacks.
The fundamental obligation of gov-
ernment is to protect its people. Since
September 11, 2001, we have done much
to meet that obligation, but more work
remains. In the aftermath of those at-
tacks, former Senator from Con-
necticut Joe Lieberman and I, as the
leaders of the Senate Homeland Secu-
rity Committee, worked in a bipartisan
way with the leaders of the 9/11 Com-
mission and the families of those who
were lost to terrorist attacks on that
day to pass the most sweeping reforms
of our intelligence community since
World War II. It is significant that the
Intelligence Reform and Terrorism
Prevention Act passed the Senate by a
vote of 96 to 2 and that, of the hundreds
of amendments that were considered,
not a single one was decided by a
party-line vote.
In what seemed like a moment, Sep-
tember 11, 2001, was transformed from a
day like any other into one that for-
ever will stand alone. The loss we re-
live reminds us of the value of all that
we must protect. The heroism reminds
us of the unconquerable spirit of the
American people. Our accomplishments
remind us that we can meet any chal-
lenge. As long as we keep this day of
remembrance in our hearts, we shall
meet the challenges that lie ahead.
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the next nomination.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read the nomination of Stephanie A.
Gallagher, of Maryland, to be United
States District Judge for the District
of Maryland.
Thereupon, the Senate proceeded to
consider the nomination.
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise
today to urge the Senate to confirm
the nomination of Stephanie Gallagher
of Maryland to be a U.S. District Judge
for the District of Maryland. This is a
noncontroversial nomination which the
Senate should be able to confirm in
short order.
Judge Stephanie Gallagher brings
tremendous experience to the court-
room as a sitting U.S. magistrate judge
in Baltimore, as well as being a former
prosecutor, private law firm attorney,
and judicial law clerk. Her strong roots
in the Maryland legal community, tre-
mendous understanding and respect for
the rule of law, and willingness to vol-
unteer her time in service outside the
courtroom make her an exceptional
nominee. I was pleased to recommend
Judge Gallagher’s nomination to Presi-
dent Trump, along with Senator VAN
HOLLEN.
I must note for my colleagues that I
originally recommended Judge Galla-
gher’s nomination to President Obama
along with Senator Mikulski, back in
2015, given the impending retirement of
Judge William Quarles in 2016. Judge
Gallagher’s nomination has actually
been favorably recommended by the
Judiciary Committee on three separate
occasions, in 2016, 2018, and now in 2019.
Most recently, on June 20, 2019, the Ju-
diciary Committee favorably rec-
ommended Judge Gallagher to the full
Senate for confirmation by a vote of
21–1.
I want to thank Senator VAN HOLLEN
for working with me to ensure we seek
out the best attorneys in our State for
Federal judicial vacancies, which are
lifetime appointments and one of the
most important obligations we have as
U.S. Senators. We have recommended
judicial nominations to the President
that have made Marylanders proud of
our Federal courts.
Stephanie Gallagher, of Baltimore,
MD, has been a U.S. magistrate judge
in Baltimore since April 2011. As a
magistrate judge, Judge Gallagher
works closely on a daily basis with dis-
trict court judges, the very position
she has been nominated for today. In
her current position as a magistrate
judge, Judge Gallagher convenes settle-
ment conferences, resolves discovery
disputes, and prepares reports and rec-
ommendations on dispositive motions.
With the consent of the parties, Judge
Gallagher can take jurisdiction over
civil cases. In consent cases, she be-
comes the presiding judge, making all
rulings in the case and overseeing the
trial. In this capacity, she has presided
over civil bench and jury trials. She
has served as the criminal duty judge
on a rotating basis with her colleagues,
where she presides over preliminary
proceedings in felony cases and handles
misdemeanor cases, including those oc-
curring at Federal military installa-
tions in Maryland.
Previously, Judge Gallagher was a
partner and cofounder at Levin & Gal-
lagher LLC, now Levin & Curlett, for 3
years, served as an Assistant U.S. At-
torney in Baltimore for 6 years, and
was a litigation associate at Akin
Gump in Washington, DC, for 2 years.
She practiced in a wide variety of legal
issues, including complex civil litiga-
tion, employment disputes, constitu-
tional issues, criminal defense, and
criminal prosecution.
Judge Gallagher began her legal ca-
reer as a law clerk for then-Chief Judge
J. Frederick Motz of the U.S. District
Court for the District of Maryland
from 1997 to 1999. She received her J.D.
in 1997 from Harvard Law School, grad-
uating cum laude, and received her
B.S. in government from Georgetown
University in 1994, graduating magna
cum laude.
The Administrative Office of the U.S.
Courts has declared this Maryland seat
as a judicial emergency, based on the
length of the vacancy and the caseload
of the court.
Judge Gallagher was given the rating
of unanimously well qualified by the
American Bar Association’s Standing
Committee on the Federal Judiciary,
which is their highest possible rating.
Judge Gallagher brings tremendous
experience and credentials to the
courtroom as a sitting U.S. Magistrate
Judge in Baltimore, as well as being a
former prosecutor, private law firm at-
torney, and judicial law clerk. Her
strong roots in the Maryland legal
community and fantastic under-
standing and respect for the rule of law
make her an exceptional nominee. I
was pleased to recommend Judge Gal-
lagher’s nomination to both President
Obama and President Trump. I am con-
fident that she will serve the people of
Maryland extremely well once she is fi-
nally confirmed for this lifetime ap-
pointment as a U.S. District Judge for
the District of Maryland.
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor
of this nomination and confirm Judge
Gallagher.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I
rise today in strong support of the con-
firmation of Judge Stephanie Galla-
gher to serve as a Federal judge for the
U.S. District Court of Maryland. Judge
Gallagher has an impressive legal
background and has provided years of
service to the State of Maryland.
She is currently a U.S. magistrate in
Maryland having served in this capac-
ity since 2011. Moreover, she has occu-
pied the position of Assistant U.S. At-
torney office for the State of Maryland.
Finally, she clerked for the Honorable
J. Frederick Motz, a Judge in Mary-
land’s Federal district court.
Judge Gallagher has been lauded re-
peatedly as a rising star, as one of
Maryland’s Super Lawyers, and has re-
ceived a number of awards and com-
mendations from a number of Federal
agencies.
Moreover, she has strong academic
credentials having graduated from Har-
vard Law School, J.D. cum laude. I
cannot think of anyone more qualified
to occupy this critical position at this
important time and am grateful for her
nomination and the Senate’s over-
whelming support for her confirmation
to serve as a Judge in Maryland’s Fed-
eral District Court.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
question is, Will the Senate advise and
consent to the Gallagher nomination?
The nomination was confirmed.

REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11TH
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President,
today we mark the 18th anniversary of
the September 11th attacks. We re-
member the nearly-3,000 people who
lost their lives. We pray for all of the
9/11 victims and their families. We
honor our 9/11 heroes. They were the
brightest lights that day in the dark
sky—our brave firefighters, police,
service men and women. So many
Americans gave their lives to save
lives that day, and we pay tribute to
them today.
Congress has passed new laws to care
for 9/11 first responders. We recently

made the 9/11 Victim Compensation
Fund permanent. This ensures that all
those who responded to the terror at-
tacks and their families have peace of
mind and first-rate healthcare.
HEALTHCARE
Mr. President, I want to turn to the
topic of the overall healthcare debate
that we are having in this country. For
the past several weeks, I have been
home in Wyoming, as you have been
home in North Dakota, and I listened
to the people I am so privileged to rep-
resent, many of whom I have been priv-
ileged to treat as their doctor. Of
course we discussed their healthcare.
As a doctor, I want to make care better
and more affordable.
Folks in Wyoming actually know me
first as a doctor, so many of them call
me Dr. BARRASSO or JOHN as opposed to
Senator BARRASSO. People back home
think of their doctors as members of
the family, as friends, neighbors who
live down the street, who go to the
same church, whose kids go to the
same schools. The local hospital in
Casper is right in the center of town.
People don’t want that to change. They
want the same people giving them care,
but they want it at lower costs.
This holds true for the rest of the
country. People are rightly concerned.
Americans worry that they won’t be
able to pay for healthcare. Republicans
are listening to these concerns, and we
are focused on lowering the out-of-
pocket costs for people’s healthcare.
That is why we ended the unfair
Obamacare tax penalty. We ended that.
We recently banned the costly drug
price gag clauses so people could know
what things actually cost and what the
best deal was for them.
Now we are focused on ending some-
thing called surprise medical billing. It
happens. You get huge medical bills
that you don’t expect and you can’t
easily pay. We are also moving more
measures to lower drug prices that peo-
ple actually have to pay.
Here is the problem: Democrats are
rejecting all of our efforts. They are
proposing costly healthcare—to me,
schemes. The Washington Post reports
that five of the seven Democratic Sen-
ators who are Members of this body
and who are running for President have
backed a one-size-fits-all approach. It
is a government-run plan they call
Medicare for All. The Washington Post
reports that a majority of House Demo-
crats also back it. They have actually
cosponsored it. They want it to become
the law.
The Democrats’ proposal would take
away on-the-job health insurance from
180 million working Americans. Let me
repeat that. What the Democrats are
proposing with their so-called Medicare
for All—a one-size-fits-all proposal for
healthcare in this country—would take
away the healthcare that people get on
the job that they earned on the job.
There are 180 million people who get
their insurance that way in America.
The cost of their proposal is $32 tril-
lion—that is ‘‘trillion’’ with a ‘‘t.’’ It is
an astronomical amount of money. Of
course, they have to pay for that, as
Senator SANDERS has said, by raising
taxes on the middle class.
These Democrats clearly aren’t fo-
cused on helping to lower the costs of
care. They are too busy, in my opinion,
with plans to destroy health insurance,
to destroy union workers’ hard-fought
insurance benefits, to destroy the cur-
rent Medicare Program for 60 million
seniors, and to destroy the health cov-
erage that people have earned at work.
For what? It is all so that government
can have complete control over Amer-
ica’s healthcare system. We can’t af-
ford for that to happen. The Democrats
have admitted that their ObamaCare
healthcare law has failed. The polling
shows that the majority of Americans
do not want a one-size-fits-all
healthcare plan for them.
Now, remember, when it came to the
vote on ObamaCare, congressional
Democrats in the House and the Senate
promised that the Obama healthcare
law would control costs. They actually
named it—I think completely mis-
named it—the Affordable Care Act. It
was the Unaffordable Care Act. What
we have seen is that out-of-pocket
costs soared and that insurance pre-
miums soared all after the Obama
healthcare law was signed. For many
Americans, health insurance premiums
have doubled since the signing of the
Obama healthcare law. Monthly pre-
miums are often more than mortgage
payments. This can’t stand. This sim-
ply can’t continue. We cannot trust the
Democrats to roll the dice again with
the healthcare of the American people.
The Republicans are focused on real
reforms—reforms that actually lower
costs and reforms that protect patients
with preexisting conditions. In July,
the Senate’s Committee on Health,
Education, Labor, and Pensions ap-
proved a measure to end surprise med-
ical billing. It also includes language
to bring down the cost of drugs. As a
doctor, I know patients shouldn’t
stress over forms. When you are sick,
you should focus on getting well. Care
from an out-of-network provider can
result in a big bill—called a surprise
medical bill—and it can easily blow an
entire family’s budget. Patients should
really not be pawns in this high-stakes
financial chess game, so we are work-
ing with President Trump to end this
unfair practice of surprise medical bill-
ing. It is the right thing to do for pa-
tients and for their families.
The Republicans are also making
progress on lowering drug costs. We
passed a bill I cosponsored to end the
drug price gag rule. As a result, pa-
tients can always find the lowest
priced drug. We are continuing to work
with the President on this and other
issues.
Still, to make more progress, we need
Democratic support and cooperation.
The choice is clear—to work together
to lower costs without lowering stand-
ards or to follow the Democratic Sen-
ators who are running for President
and follow the House Democrats who
are pushing for a one-size-fits-all, gov-
ernment-run healthcare for America
with the loss of choice and the loss of
control—all of the concerns that come
with a one-size-fits-all, government ap-
proach.
It doesn’t seem like they are for low-
ering costs. It seems they are for rais-
ing your taxes and taking away your
control and your choice. They are not
for improving care. They are for in-
creasing and growing the role of gov-
ernment. Remember, the Democrats
want to take away health insurance
from 180 million Americans—working
Americans—people who go to work
every day and have earned their health
insurance at work.
At the same time, the Democrats
who are running for President are
promising free healthcare. I was aston-
ished when I heard this from the Demo-
crats. They are promising free
healthcare for illegal immigrants.
They want to take insurance away
from hard-working Americans and give
insurance—free—to illegal immigrants.
What kind of proposal is that? Who is
being represented with this proposal by
these Democratic Senators and other
Democrats who are running for Presi-
dent? Who do you think is going to pay
for all of this? Why should we pay more
to wait longer for worse care?
It is not something Americans want
or will tolerate. Instead, let’s give pa-
tients the care they need from the doc-
tors they choose and at lower costs.
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11TH
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I start
my remarks tonight by thanking my
colleague from Wyoming for his re-
marks concerning the anniversary of
the horror that was September 11, 2001.
I join him and all of my colleagues
here in recognizing that in the midst of
that horror, the American people came
together, and we demonstrated the
strength, kindness, bravery, and resil-
ience that we have throughout our his-
tory.
I, too, remember the victims, their
loved ones, as well as all of the brave
first responders. I thank all of the men
and women of our military who con-
tinue to fight against terrorism and
who keep us safe, and I remember the
lives lost on the battlefield.
OPIOID EPIDEMIC
Mr. President, I also want to take a
minute tonight to talk about the im-
portance of there being the continued
funding to address our Nation’s opioid
crisis. As the Senate Appropriations
Committee prepares its markup of the
Labor, Health and Human Services,
and Education, and Related Agencies’
fiscal year 2020 budget, I rise to discuss
the urgent need for additional funding
to combat the fentanyl, heroin, and
opioid crisis.

tinues to ravage communities in my
home State of New Hampshire and all

across our country. People in New
Hampshire are doing vital work to ad-
dress this crisis and get those who are
struggling the support they need to get
and stay healthy.
Just last month, I visited Moms in
Recovery in Lebanon, which is an ad-
diction services program through Dart-
mouth-Hitchcock that is providing
comprehensive care to get pregnant
and parenting women the services they
need to address substance misuse. In
Lebanon, NH, Moms in Recovery offers
everything from medication-assisted
treatment to group therapy, coun-
seling, outpatient therapy, parenting
classes, and more. Providers said that
what started as a program for 5 women
is now serving 60. It has transformed
from a program that just served preg-
nant women to one that is now serving
women after they give birth. It works
to help them stabilize their lives and to
reengage in our workforce and in our
communities.
People in my State are implementing
innovative approaches to help their
friends and neighbors, and Congress
needs to give them the support they
need to help save lives.
I have been proud to work with Sen-
ator SHAHEEN and my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to strengthen
support for treatment, recovery, pre-
vention, and law enforcement efforts.
This includes having worked to secure
more than $6 billion in the 2018 budget
agreement for governmentwide efforts
to combat this crisis and to ensure
that as the appropriations process pro-
gressed, hardest hit States, including
the Granite State, were prioritized.
Last year, we also passed the SUP-
PORT for Patients and Communities
Act, which the President signed into
law. It included, among many critical
priorities, the following: establishing
comprehensive opioid recovery centers,
expanding access to medication-as-
sisted treatment, and supporting law
enforcement in its efforts to curb the
shipment of fentanyl through the Post-
al Service.
Yet nobody in this body should think
that our work is anywhere near com-
plete. As the Appropriations Com-
mittee considers funding bills for the
next fiscal year, I urge my colleagues
on the committee to ensure that State
opioid response grants, which have
been a vital tool in increasing access to
treatment, recovery, and prevention,
are fully funded. While these grants
should be increased, they must, at the
very least, be fully funded at the fiscal
year 2019 levels.
It is also imperative to continue
prioritizing hardest hit States and to
give communities additional flexibility
to use this funding to address other
substances that are being used in con-
junction with or instead of opioids.
While the vast majority of overdose
deaths in New Hampshire still involve
opioids, specifically fentanyl, we are
seeing substances like crystal meth-
amphetamine emerge as a growing
issue. Additional flexibility in funding
can help communities respond to this
challenge in realtime.
This crisis didn’t begin overnight,
and it will not be solved overnight.
What we need at the Federal level is a
long-term solution and additional cer-
tainty so States and communities
know they will have stable and con-
sistent Federal funding as they imple-
ment strategies and treatment pro-
grams that will help save lives.
One important next step would be to
pass Senator SHAHEEN’s Turn the Tide
Act, which is legislation I have cospon-
sored that would invest $63 billion in
flexible funding over 10 years, support
treatment and prevention efforts, and
address workforce challenges in the
treatment field. This is the kind of
long-term, comprehensive approach we
should be taking, and I will continue to
join with Senator SHAHEEN to push for
this bill.
The fentanyl, heroin, and opioid cri-
sis remains the most pressing public
health and public safety challenge fac-
ing New Hampshire and many other
communities across our country, and
the biggest mistake anyone could
make is in thinking our efforts to ad-
dress this crisis are close to being done.
I am going to continue to push to en-
sure that those on the frontlines of this
crisis have the support they need. I
urge my colleagues to join me so we
can make our families, communities,
and country healthier and safer so we
can help save lives.
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11TH
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I
so enjoy listening to my colleagues as
they talk about the issues that are im-
portant to them and to the States they
represent. It is, indeed, one of those
privileges that we in this body enjoy,
and many times we take it for granted.
Yet today is a day of remembrance. It
is a day that we look back and say we
ought not take it for granted because
there are many in this world who
would threaten our freedoms and our
liberties.
Earlier this week, I was talking with
some of the members of our team, and
we were trading stories about where we
were on the morning of September 11
and how it affected the way we viewed
their place in the world, and their
memories, and what their recollections
were. Those of us who vividly remem-
ber that day still recall an unsettling
cascade of emotions. There was shock,
confusion, and, finally, dread as we re-
alized we were not, as initially
thought, seeing a senseless accident,
but that, indeed, we were under attack.
As the morning wore on, dread really
gave way to fear and panic and, finally,
to absolute terror that our loved ones
who were in New York, Washington,
and Pennsylvania and who were in the
air, maybe flying home, were among
those who were experiencing firsthand
what was happening. It was the perfect
storm of conflicting media reports and
jammed cell service that made it al-
most impossible to reach out to people
and to ask that question, ‘‘Are you
OK?’’ and to hear their voices.
Through the smoke and the blood
came a moment of awful clarity. Life
would never be the same because we
would never again experience life with-
out feeling as if we were a target. The
events of September 11 introduced a
new generation of Americans to the re-
ality that our country is not and will
never be immune to the threat of ter-
ror.
Those who were teetering on the edge
of adulthood may not have imme-
diately made the connection between
global politics and the disaster that
was playing out on TV in real time.
Yet, by the time terrorists struck that
second tower, I think a lot of people
really had begun to understand what
was happening. Later, they learned
that a half a world away, a group of
men who referred to themselves as al-
Qaida had made it their life’s mission
to murder Americans. They were doing
it to prove a point. Yes, it did leave a
mark on this Nation and on our citi-
zens. Younger Americans’ memories of
that day really are fuzzier, but almost
without exception, my staff members
remember what they now describe as a
sense of national unity rising up in the
days following the attacks.
They remember that every house on
the street flew an American flag and
that every adult they knew stood in a
line to give blood. They saw small town
first responders load up those
firetrucks and emergency vehicles and
head to New York.
At the time, they really didn’t under-
stand geopolitics, but they did under-
stand fear and suffering because they
saw that fear in the eyes of their teach-
ers and in the eyes of the adults who
surrounded them; but they also saw the
shift that the attacks and the after-
math caused in our country. For a
time, partisanship and bitterness was
washed away. What you saw was unity,
and waving flags.
Now, almost 20 years later, memories
are growing fuzzy. Sometimes they are
nonexistent. Calls for unity have been
replaced by heated debate. Too often,
the loudest voices look back at 9/11 as
an event in the collective memory, and
they don’t look at it as an occurrence
that changed lives and lifestyles for-
ever.
They consider in passing the rem-
nants of the attacks in debates over
foreign policy and defense spending,
but ignore why we remain so focused
on national security. This is why every
year, without exception, we remind
ourselves that the kind of hatred it
takes to bring an entire country to its
knees gives no quarter.
We acknowledge the actions of 19 ter-
rorists whose twisted beliefs led to the
violent murder of nearly 3,000 innocent
people because even though the panic
of that awful morning has faded, our
enemies’ desire to make an example of
us has not. But America, with all her

imperfections, still thrives in utter de-
fiance of hatred, divisiveness, and de-
struction.
Today, we remember those who died,
and we keep their memory as a beacon
against the void that allowed violence
and terror.
We remember the heroes who defied
fear and reason and ran toward the
flames, putting love of country and
countrymen above all else.
And we remember and remind our-
selves that by simply standing back up,
America made herself the world’s best
example of what it looks like when
love, hope, and valor triumph over the
forces of darkness.

ernment and contractor engineering, logis-
tics, and personnel services; and other re-
lated elements of logistics and program sup-
port. The estimated cost is $6.5 billion.
This proposed sale will support the foreign
policy and national security of the United
States by improving the security of a NATO
ally, which is an important force for polit-
ical stability and economic progress in Eu-
rope. This sale is consistent with U.S. initia-
tives to provide key allies in the region with
modem systems that will enhance interoper-
ability with U.S. forces and increase secu-
rity.
This proposed sale of F–35s will provide Po-
land with a credible defense capability to
deter aggression in the region and ensure
interoperability with U.S. forces. The pro-
posed sale will augment Poland’s operational
aircraft inventory and enhance its air-to-air
and air-to-ground self-defense capability.
The Polish Air Force’s legacy MiG–29 and
Su–22 fleet will be replaced with F–35s. Po-
land will have no difficulty absorbing these
aircraft into its armed forces.
The proposed sale of this aircraft, systems
and support will not alter the basic military
balance in the region.
The prime contractors will be Lockheed
Martin Aeronautics Company in Fort Worth,
Texas; and Pratt &Whitney Military Engines
in East Hartford, Connecticut. There are no
known offset agreements proposed in connec-
tion with this potential sale. However, the
purchaser typically requests offsets. Any off-
set agreements will be defined in negotia-
tions between the purchaser and the con-
tractor(s).
Implementation of this proposed sale will
require multiple trips to Poland involving
U.S. Government and contractor representa-
tives for technical reviews/support, program
management and training over the life of the
program. U.S. contractor representatives
will be required in Poland to conduct Con-
tractor Engineering Technical Services
(CETS) and Autonomic Logistics and Global
Support (ALGS) for after aircraft delivery.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.

OREGON WILDLANDS ACT
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Orego-
nians love and cherish their wild riv-
ers, and I am pleased we were able to
protect many of these Oregon treasures
in the Oregon Wildlands Act, which
Congress included as part of the John
D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Manage-
ment, and Recreation Act. The act
adds 255 miles of new Wild and Scenic
Rivers in Oregon.
Some, but not all, of these new or ex-
panded wild and scenic rivers des-
ignated under the John D. Dingell, Jr.
Conservation, Management, and Recre-
ation Act were evaluated by the Bu-
reau of Land Management for their po-
tential inclusion in the National Wild
and Scenic Rivers System. These eval-
uations in many cases identified the
rivers’ ‘‘outstandingly remarkable val-
ues,’’ ORVs, consistent with agency
regulations and guidance. The Wild and
Scenic Rivers Act specifies that wild

and scenic rivers are managed to ‘‘pro-
tect and enhance the values,’’ 16 USC
1281(a), for which the wild and scenic
river was established.
The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act gen-
erally defines ‘‘outstandingly remark-
able values’’ as ‘‘scenic, recreational,
geologic, fish and wildlife, historic,
cultural, or other similar values.’’ The
Federal land management agencies, in-
cluding the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment, which is administering most of
the new and expanded wild and scenic
rivers in the Oregon Wildlands Act, has
defined ‘‘other’’ values as, but not lim-
ited to, ‘‘ecological, biological or bo-
tanical, paleontological, hydrological,
traditional cultural uses, water qual-
ity, and scientific values.’’
Some of the new and expanded wild
and scenic rivers in Oregon Wildlands
Act were never evaluated by the agen-
cy. Therefore, as part of the fact-gath-
ering by my staff based on State and
Federal agency data and research and
public input during the development of
the legislation, ORVs were determined
for the new and expanded wild and sce-
nic rivers. The table I am including
with my statement lists both the gen-
eral and specific ORVs identified dur-
ing consideration of the legislation. It
is to protect and enhance these values
for which I, as the chief sponsor of the
Oregon Wilderness Act, included the
various wild and scenic rivers in the
legislation that Congress ultimately
included in the John D. Dingell, Jr.
Conservation, Management, and Recre-
ation Act. This table includes both the
outstandingly remarkable values that
BLM found for the stream segments, as
well as additional values.
The John D. Dingell, Jr. Conserva-
tion, Management, and Recreation Act
reflects the Nation’s commitment to
protect America’s rivers, streams, and
special places. I am pleased the legisla-
tion permanently protects from dam-
ming, diversion, and mining over 255
miles of Oregon’s pristine rivers and
streams as part of the nation’s Wild
and Scenic Rivers system.
I ask unanimous consent that the
table be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO DR. BARDETT
FAUSETT
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I
have the honor of recognizing Dr.
Bardett Fausett, of Missoula County,
for his service in providing care and
treatment to Montana mothers and ba-
bies.
Early in his career, Dr. Fausett made
the decision to serve his country in the
U.S. Air Force. After serving his coun-
try, he was able to afford to go to med-
ical school and provide for his young
family after college. After serving 25
years in the Air Force, Dr. Fausett re-
tired from his military service earned a
position at the Missoula Community
Medical Center.
Dr. Fausett went to Missoula with
the hope of serving the community and
providing care and treatment for moth-
ers and their babies. Fausett took up
the challenge of handling mothers with
very complicated pregnancies and med-
ical issues.
As a maternal fetal medicine spe-
cialist, he focused on treating babies
and mothers while the baby is still in
the womb. Pregnant mothers from all
over the region with complicated med-
ical issues traveled to see Dr. Fausett
with the hope that he could help their
families.
In his 5 years in Missoula, Dr.
Fausett has delivered about 1,200 ba-
bies.
His service to our Nation in the U.S.
Air Force as well as his dedication to
continue his service by providing care
to Montana mothers and babies is ex-
emplary of the Montana spirit. He has
changed the lives of many families
across Montana by giving them per-
sonal care through challenging times.∑

RECOGNIZING EXPERTISE
COSMETOLOGY INSTITUTE
∑ Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, each
week the U.S. Senate Committee on
Small Business and Entrepreneurship
recognizes one small business that ex-
emplifies the hard work and persever-
ance of the American Dream and the
American entrepreneur. The great
State of Nevada is home to more than
250,000 small businesses of all types,
from mom-and-pop shop bakeries to
world renowned cyber security firms.
Nevada’s small businesses are the driv-
ing force behind our State’s rapidly
growing economy and the engine that
powers our communities. It is therefore
my honor to recognize Nevada’s Exper-
tise Cosmetology Institute, a small
business with a strong and deep-rooted
commitment to improving lives and a
desire to give back to the community,
for recently having been named the
U.S. Senate Small Business of the
Week.
Small businesses, especially minor-
ity-owned small businesses, are break-
ing down barriers in every corner of
Nevada. Expertise Cosmetology Insti-
tute is the first African-American-
owned school of cosmetology in Nevada
and helps many of their students re-
ceive degrees in cosmetology, hair de-
sign, nail technology, aesthetics, and
barbering. Expertise Cosmetology In-
stitute equips its students with the
knowledge to thrive in the barbering
and salon industry and ensures grad-
uates have the skills necessary to suc-
ceed post-graduation. Students gain a
comprehensive knowledge of State reg-
ulations, training on the latest trends,
and most importantly, how to manage
a small business of their own. Exper-
tise Cosmetology offers financial aid to
those students who qualify so no stu-
dent with the desire to succeed in this
industry is left behind.
I would also like to recognize Mrs.
Gwen Braimoh who, in addition to
managing Expertise Cosmetology, also
runs the Expertise New Path program
in Nevada. The Expertise New Path
program helps women earn their cos-
metology license while incarcerated at
Florence McClure Women’s Correc-
tional Center in North Las Vegas, NV.
Mrs. Braimoh’s passion for helping the
less fortunate and those who wish to
build a better life for themselves is
changing lives and improving our com-
munities across the State of Nevada.
Small businesses truly are the driv-
ing force for development and growth
not just in Nevada but across our en-
tire Nation. Small businesses like
Gwen’s not only help our economy suc-
ceed, they also give back by uplifting
our communities, inspiring others to

Again, I would like to recognize Mrs.
Gwen Braimoh and all the employees
at Expertise Cosmetology Institute for
their contribution to Nevada and our
Nation and congratulate them for
being named the Senate Small Busi-

RECOGNIZING RETHREADED
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as chair-
man of the Committee on Small Busi-
ness and Entrepreneurship, each week I
recognize a small business that exem-
plifies the American entrepreneurial
spirit at the heart of our economy. It is
my privilege to honor a Florida small
business that not only produces out-
standing products but also assists sur-
vivors of human trafficking by pro-
viding dignified work and a second
chance at life. This week, it is my
pleasure to recognize Rethreaded of
Jacksonville, FL as the Senate Small
Business of the Week.
Rethreaded was established in 2011
following founder Kristin Keen’s return
from India where she worked with vic-
tims of human trafficking. Realizing
that there was a need in her own com-
munity to provide opportunities to sur-
vivors, Kristin sought to create a safe
haven where women could learn skills
while also earning a living. Many Re-
threaded employees are survivors of
human trafficking, and since its
launch, Rethreaded has employed 40
women. The company has raised aware-
ness about the horrific realities of
human trafficking in the immediate
community and beyond as well.
Rethreaded sells conscious gifts and
handcrafted accessories such as purses,
scarves, and jewelry at its storefront in
Jacksonville, as well as online. Their
website not only provides nationwide
customers access to their products, but
it also serves as a platform from which
they promote human rights issues that
are foundational to Rethreaded’s pur-
pose.
Over the years, Rethreaded has
partnered with more than 300 compa-
nies, including Southwest Airlines,
which provides airline seat leather for
various ‘‘upcycled’’ products such as
keychains and earrings. Since the be-
ginning of this partnership, Southwest
has provided more than 5,400 pounds of
leather to Rethreaded, saving 2.8 tons
of waste from entering our Nation’s
landfills. This partnership provided na-
tional exposure, but it was not the first
time Rethreaded has received acclaim.
The company appeared on ‘‘Project
Runway All Stars,’’ an opportunity
which gave their brand yet another
chance to promote their mission. Addi-
tionally, Rethreaded has established
relationships with numerous strategic
partners, named Freedom Partners,
which supply ready-made products
from around the world. Selling these
ready-made products in the Rethreaded
storefront and online supports like-
minded enterprises that also strive to
end human trafficking.
Rethreaded not only creates sustain-
able products for a good cause but also
provides a supportive community for
women who are in need of hope and
healing. In addition to providing em-
ployment, Rethreaded has established
programs to assist employees in the re-
covery process. Programs such as its
warm-line telephone crisis support
service, mental health group services,
care management services, and indi-
vidual counseling services target the
unique challenges facing trauma vic-
tims.
Congratulations to Kristin and the
entire team at Rethreaded on their 8
years of service. I commend their ef-
forts to provide dignified employment
and skills training to women in our
community who have been impacted by
human trafficking. Rethreaded is a
great example of the positive impact
social entrepreneurship ventures can
have in our communities. I look for-
ward to watching their continued
growth and success.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and
were referred or ordered to lie on the
table as indicated:
POM–132. A joint resolution adopted by the
Legislature of the State of California urging
the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices to rescind the new Title X regulations
that will impede access to essential, time-
sensitive health care for low-income individ-
uals across California and the nation; to the
Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and
Pensions.
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 4
Whereas, The federal Title X family plan-
ning program was established in 1970 by the
United States Congress with broad bipar-
tisan support to provide high-quality family
planning services and other preventive care
to low-income and uninsured individuals who
may otherwise lack access to health care;
and
Whereas, Title X is the sole federal pro-
gram dedicated to funding family planning
services, including birth control, pregnancy
testing, and the prevention and treatment of
sexually transmitted diseases; and
Whereas, Title X supports outreach and
education efforts that link community mem-
bers to care; and
Whereas, California’s Title X provider net-
work, which is the largest and most diverse
Title X system in the nation, served more
than one million low-income Californians in
2017 and over 25 percent of all Title X pa-
tients nationwide; and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5447
September 11, 2019
Whereas, Every $1 invested in publicly
funded family planning and related services
saves taxpayers $7 by helping avert costs re-
lated to unintended pregnancies; and
Whereas, One billion three hundred thou-
sand dollars is saved annually in California
because of public investment in family plan-
ning and related services provided at Title X
health care centers across the state; and
Whereas, Services provided by clinics that
received Title X funding in California helped
patients avert over 200,000 unintended preg-
nancies in 2015; and
Whereas, Title X is an essential part of
California’s family planning safety net and
has played a critical role in reducing unin-
tended pregnancy rates to a 30-year low, and
Whereas, The new federal Title X regula-
tions interfere with the provider-patient re-
lationship and gag Title X funded agencies
by directing providers to withhold full and
accurate medical information from patients
about pregnancy options or by prohibiting
providers from giving patients referrals for
abortion care; and
Whereas, Patients rely on and trust their
health care providers to provide a com-
prehensive, accurate, and unbiased evalua-
tion of their condition, along with all avail-
able treatment options, and
Whereas, The American Medical Associa-
tion’s Code of Medical Ethics establishes
that withholding information without the
patient’s knowledge or consent is ethically
unacceptable and that patients should be in-
formed of all burdens, risks, and expected
benefits of all medical options; and
Whereas, The State of California strongly
believes public dollars should go toward fam-
ily planning programs that provide com-
prehensive, medically accurate, unbiased in-
formation, and offer the full range of contra-
ceptive methods; and
Whereas, The federal government’s harm-
ful Title X regulations are likely to force
many health care organizations and qualified
family planning providers in California to
choose between a critical funding source and
accepting onerous and unnecessary regula-
tions, resulting in reduced access to quality,
time-sensitive care for low-income individ-
uals across the state: Now, therefore. be it
Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of
the State of California, jointly, That the Legis-
lature respectfully urges the United States
Department of Health and Human Services
to rescind the new Title X regulations that
will impede access to essential, time-sen-
sitive health care for low-income individuals
across California and the nation; and be it
further
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate
transmit copies of this resolution to the
President and Vice President of the United
States, to the Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives, to the Majority Leader of the
Senate, to each Senator and Representative
from California in the Congress of the United
States, to the United States Department of
Health and Human Services. and to the au-
thor for appropriate distribution.
POM–133. A concurrent resolution adopted
by the Senate of the State of Mississippi urg-
ing the United States Congress, pursuant to
Article V of the United States Constitution,
to call a Convention for the specific and ex-
clusive purpose of proposing amendments to
the Constitution of the United States lim-
ited to the purposes of imposing fiscal re-
straints on the federal government and lim-
iting the power and jurisdiction of the fed-
eral government; to the Committee on the
Judiciary.
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 596
Whereas, the Founders of the United
States Constitution empowered state legisla-
tors to be guardians of liberty against exces-
sive use of power by the federal government;
and
Whereas, the federal government has cre-
ated a crushing national debt through im-
proper and imprudent spending; and
Whereas, the federal government has
ceased to operate under a proper interpreta-
tion of the United States Constitution; and
Whereas, the federal government has in-
vaded the legitimate roles of the states
through the manipulative process of federal
mandates, most of which are unfunded to a
great extent; and
Whereas, it is the solemn duty of the
states to protect the liberty of our people,
particularly for the generations to come, by
proposing amendments to the United States
Constitution through a Convention of the
States under Article V for the purpose of re-
straining these and related abuses of power;
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate of the State of Mis-
sissippi, the House of Representatives Concur-
ring Therein:
SECTION 1. That pursuant to Article V of
the Constitution of the United States, the
Legislature of the State of Mississippi joins
in the applications of the States of Georgia
(SR 736, 2014), Florida (SM 476, 2014), Alaska
(HJR 22, 2014), Alabama (HJR 112, 2015), Ten-
nessee (SJR 67, 2016), Indiana (SJR 14, 2016),
Oklahoma (SJR 4, 2016), Louisiana (SCR 52,
2016), Texas (SJR 2, 2017), Missouri (SCR 4,
2017), North Dakota (HCR 3006, 2017), Arizona
(HCR 2010, 2017), and Arkansas (SJR 3, 2019)
to call a Convention for the specific and ex-
clusive purpose of proposing amendments to
the Constitution of the United States lim-
ited to the purposes stated in those applica-
tions; provided, however, that the commis-
sioners from Mississippi to the Convention
are expressly limited to consideration and
support of amendments that impose fiscal re-
straints on the federal government, and
amendments that limit the power and juris-
diction of the federal government, and no
amendments on any other topic whatsoever.
The Mississippi delegates are hereby in-
structed not to support term limits for mem-
bers of Congress.
SECTION 2. It is the express intention of
the Mississippi Legislature that this applica-
tion is to be aggregated with the applica-
tions of the above-mentioned states and with
subsequent applications of other states lim-
ited to the purposes identified in this appli-
cation and in those applications of the
above-mentioned states.
SECTION 3. The Legislature of Mississippi
adopts this application expressly subject to
the following reservations, understandings
and declarations:
(a) An application to the Congress of the
United States to call an Amendment Conven-
tion of the States pursuant to Article V of
the United States Constitution confers no
power to Congress other than the power to
call such a Convention. The power of Con-
gress to exercise this ministerial duty con-
sists solely of the authority to name a rea-
sonable time and place for the initial meet-
ing of a Convention;
(b) Congress shall perform its ministerial
duty of calling an Amendment Convention of
the States only upon the receipt of applica-
tions for an Amendment Convention for the
substantially same purpose as this applica-
tion from two-thirds of the legislatures of
the several states;
(c) Congress does not have the power or au-
thority to determine any rules for the gov-
erning of a Convention for proposing amend-
ments called pursuant to Article V of the
United States Constitution. Congress does
not have the power to set the number of del-
egates to be sent by any state to such a Con-
vention, nor does it have the power to name
delegates to such a Convention. The power to
name delegates remains exclusively within
the authority of the legislatures of the sev-
eral states;
(d) By definition, an Amendment Conven-
tion of the states means that states shall
vote on the basis of one state, one vote;
(e) A Convention for proposing amend-
ments convened pursuant to this application
shall he limited to consideration of the top-
ics specified herein and no other. This appli-
cation is made with the express under-
standing that an amendment that in any
way seeks to amend, modify or repeal any
provision of the Bill of Rights shall not be
authorized for consideration at any stage.
This application shall be void if ever used at
any stage to consider any change to any pro-
vision of the Bill of Rights;
(f) Pursuant to Article V of the United
States Constitution, Congress may deter-
mine whether proposed amendments shall be
ratified by the legislatures of the several
states or by special state ratification con-
ventions. The Legislature of Mississippi rec-
ommends that Congress select ratification
by the legislatures of the several states; and
(g) The Legislature of Mississippi may pro-
vide further instructions to its delegates and
may recall its delegates at any time for a
breach of a duty or a violation of the in-
structions provided.
SECTION 4. The Secretary of State is here-
by directed to transmit copies of this appli-
cation to the President and Secretary of the
United States Senate and to the Speaker and
Clerk of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, and copies to the members of
the said Senate and House of Representa-
tives from this state; also to transmit copies
hereof to the presiding officers of each of the
legislative houses in the several states, re-
questing their cooperation.
SECTION 5. This application constitutes a
continuing application in accordance with
Article V of the Constitution of the United
States until the legislatures of at least two-
thirds of the several states have made appli-
cations on the same subject, or until the
Mississippi Legislature acts to withdraw this
application.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS
SENATE RESOLUTION 308—CALL-
ING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF
THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION TO
PROVIDE EVIDENCE OR TO RE-
LEASE UNITED STATES CITIZEN
PAUL WHELAN
Mr. PETERS (for himself and Ms.
STABENOW) submitted the following
resolution; which was referred to the
Committee on Foreign Relations:
S. RES. 308
Whereas United States citizen Paul Whelan
is a resident of Novi, Michigan, and a United
States Marine Corps veteran;
Whereas Paul Whelan traveled to Moscow
for the wedding of a personal friend on De-
cember 22, 2018;
Whereas Russia’s Federal Security Service
arrested Paul Whelan at the Metropol Hotel
in Moscow on December 28, 2018, and charged
him with espionage;
Whereas Paul Whelan was imprisoned in
Lefortovo Prison and continues to be held
there more than eight months after his ar-
rest;
Whereas the Federal Security Service has
not provided any evidence of supposed
wrongdoing;
Whereas a Moscow court has extended Paul
Whelan’s pre-trial detention multiple times
without publicly presenting justification or
evidence of wrongdoing;
Whereas officials from the United States
Embassy in Moscow have routinely had their
topics of discussion with Paul Whelan se-
verely limited by the Federal Security Serv-
ice;
Whereas even Paul Whelan’s Federal Secu-
rity Service-appointed lawyer, Vladimir
Zherebenkov, said on May 24, 2019, ‘‘[The
Federal Security Service] always roll[s] out
what they have, but in this case, we’ve seen
nothing concrete against Whelan in five
months. That means there is nothing.’’;
Whereas the United States Ambassador to
Russia, Jon Huntsman, responded on April
12, 2019, to a question about the detention of
Paul Whelan, ‘‘If the Russians have evidence,
they should bring it forward. We have seen
nothing. If there was a case, I think the evi-
dence would have been brought forward by
now.’’; and
Whereas Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey
Lavrov on May 14, 2019, and urged him to en-
sure United States citizens are not unjustly
held abroad: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) urges the Government of the Russian
Federation to present credible evidence on
the allegations against Paul Whelan or im-
mediately release him from detention;
(2) urges the Government of the Russian
Federation to provide unrestricted consular
access to Paul Whelan while he remains in
detention;
(3) urges the Government of the Russian
Federation to ensure Paul Whelan is afforded
due process and universally recognized
human rights;
(4) encourages the President and the Sec-
retary of State to continue to press the Gov-
ernment of the Russian Federation at every
opportunity and urge the Government of the
Russian Federation to guarantee a fair and
transparent judicial process without undue
delay in accordance with its international
legal obligation; and
(5) expresses sympathy to the family of
Paul Whelan and expresses hope that their
ordeal can soon be brought to an end.

UYGHUR HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY
ACT OF 2019
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 99, S. 178.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the bill by title.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read as follows:
A bill (S. 178) to condemn gross human
rights violations of ethnic Turkic Muslims in
Xinjiang, and calling for an end to arbitrary
detention, torture, and harassment of these
communities inside and outside China.
There being no objection, the Senate
proceeded to consider the bill, which
had been reported from the Committee
on Foreign Relations, with an amend-
ment to strike all after the enacting
clause and insert in lieu thereof the
following:
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Uyghur Human
Rights Policy Act of 2019’’.
SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
The purpose of this Act is to direct United
States resources to address gross violations of
universally recognized human rights, including
the mass internment of over 1,000,000 Uyghurs
and other predominately Muslim ethnic minori-
ties in China and the intimidation and threats
faced by United States citizens and legal perma-
nent residents.
SEC. 3. APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMIT-
TEES.
In this section, the term ‘‘appropriate congres-
sional committees’’ means—
(1) the Committee on Foreign Relations, the
Committee on Armed Services, the Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence, the Committee on Bank-
ing, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the Committee
on the Judiciary, and the Committee on Appro-
priations of the Senate; and
(2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the
Committee on Armed Services, the Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee
on Financial Services, the Committee on the Ju-
diciary, and the Committee on Appropriations of
the House of Representatives.
SEC. 4. FINDINGS.
Congress makes the following findings:
(1) The Government of the People’s Republic
of China has a long history of repressing ap-
proximately 13,000,000 Turkic, moderate Sunni
Muslims, particularly Uyghurs, in the nomi-
nally autonomous Xinjiang region. These ac-
tions are in contravention of international
human rights standards, including the Uni-
versal Declaration of Human Rights and the
International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights.
(2) In recent decades, central and regional
Chinese government policies have systematically
discriminated against Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs,
and other Muslims in Xinjiang by denying them
a range of civil and political rights, including
the freedoms of expression, religion, movement,
and a fair trial, among others.
(3) Increased unrest in the Xinjiang region as
a result of the central government’s severe re-
pression is used in Orwellian fashion by the
Government of the People’s Republic of China
as evidence of ‘‘terrorism’’ and ‘‘separatism’’
and as an excuse for further disproportionate
response.
(4) In 2014, Chinese authorities launched their
latest ‘‘Strike Hard against Violent Extremism’’
campaign, in which the pretext of wide-scale,
internationally linked threats of terrorism were
used to justify pervasive restrictions on, and
gross human rights violations against, the eth-
nic minority communities of Xinjiang.
(5) Those policies included—
(A) pervasive, high-tech surveillance across
the region, including the arbitrary collection of
biodata, such as DNA samples from children,
without their knowledge or consent;
(B) the use of QR codes outside homes to
gather information on how frequently individ-
uals pray;
(C) facial and voice recognition software and
‘‘predictive policing’’ databases; and
(D) severe restrictions on the freedom of move-
ment across the region.
(6) Chinese security forces have never been
held accountable for credible reports of mass
shootings in Alaqagha (2014), Hanerik (2013),
and Siriqbuya (2013), as well as the
extrajudicial killings of Abdulbasit Ablimit
(2013) and Rozi Osman (2014).
(7)(A) The August 2016 transfer of former
Tibet Autonomous Region Party Secretary Chen
Quanguo to become the Xinjiang Party Sec-
retary prompted an acceleration in the crack-
down across the region.
(B) Local officials in Xinjiang have used
chilling political rhetoric to describe the purpose
of government policy, including ‘‘eradicating tu-
mors’’ and ‘‘spray[ing] chemicals’’ on crops to
kill the ‘‘weeds’’.
(C) Uyghurs are forced to celebrate Chinese
cultural traditions, such as Chinese New Year,
and unique Uyghur culture is facing eradication
due to state control over Uyghur cultural herit-
age, such as muqam (a musical tradition) and
meshrep (traditional cultural gatherings), and
due to elimination of the Uyghur language as a
medium of instruction in Xinjiang schools and
universities.
(8) In 2017, credible reports found that family
members of Uyghurs living outside of China had
gone missing inside China, that Chinese au-
thorities were pressuring those outside the coun-
try to return, and that individuals were being
arbitrarily detained in large numbers.
(9) There is ample credible evidence provided
by scholars, human rights organizations, jour-
nalists, and think tanks substantiating the es-
tablishment by Chinese authorities of ‘‘political
reeducation’’ camps.
(10) Independent organizations conducted
interviews, including testimonies from Kayrat
Samarkan, Omir Bekali, and Mihrigul Tursun,
along with others who had been detained in
such facilities, who described forced political in-
doctrination, torture, beatings, food depriva-
tion, and solitary confinement, as well as uncer-
tainty as to the length of detention, humilia-
tion, and denial of religious, cultural, and lin-
guistic freedoms, and confirmed that they were
told by guards that the only way to secure re-
lease was to demonstrate sufficient political loy-
alty. Poor conditions and lack of medical treat-
ment at such facilities appear to have contrib-
uted to the deaths of some detainees, including
the elderly and infirm. Uyghurs Muhammed
Salih Hajim (2018), Yaqupjan Naman (2018),
Abdughappar Abdujappar (2018), Ayhan Memet
(2018), Abdulreshit Seley Hajim (2018),
Nurimangul Memet (2018), Adalet Teyip (2018),
Abdulehed Mehsum (2017), Hesen Imin (2017),
and Sawut Raxman (2017) reportedly died while
in the custody of the Chinese authorities in ‘‘po-
litical reeducation’’ camps, without proper in-
vestigation of the circumstances.
(11) Uyghurs and Kazakhs, who have now ob-
tained permanent residence or citizenship in
other countries, attest to receiving threats and
harassment from Chinese officials.
(12) Under pressure from the Government of
the People’s Republic of China, countries have
forcibly returned Uyghurs to China in violation
of the non-refoulement principle and their well-
founded fear of persecution. States returning
Uyghurs include Egypt, Malaysia, Thailand,
Laos, Burma, Cambodia, Vietnam, Kazakhstan,
Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Nepal, and
India.
(13) Six journalists for Radio Free Asia’s
Uyghur service have publicly detailed abuses
their family members in Xinjiang have endured
in response to their work exposing abusive poli-
cies across the region.
(14) Several United States-based companies
are conducting business with Xinjiang authori-
ties without sufficient due diligence or safe-
guards to ensure their business operations do
not create or contribute to human rights viola-
tions.
(15) The Government of the People’s Republic
of China is increasingly investing in the ‘‘Belt
and Road Initiative’’ across Xinjiang and
throughout Central Asia, extending its influence
through organizations such as the Shanghai Co-
operation Organization without regard to the
political, religious, cultural, or linguistic rights
of ethnic minorities.
(16) The Secretary of State, Congressional-Ex-
ecutive Commission on China, Tom Lantos
Human Rights Commission, and individual
members of the executive branch and Congress
have all expressed growing concern regarding
the pervasive human rights abuses across
Xinjiang and the ‘‘political reeducation’’ camps.
(17) In August 2018, the United Nations Com-
mittee to Eliminate Racial Discrimination chal-
lenged the Government of the People’s Republic
of China over abuses in Xinjiang, including the
establishment of mass arbitrary detention
camps.
(18) Between August and September 2018, Chi-
nese authorities responded to these allegations
by either flatly denying them or insisting that
the facilities are ‘‘vocational training centers’’.
(19) In September 2018, newly appointed
United Nations High Commissioner for Human
Rights Michele Bachelet noted in her first
speech as High Commissioner the ‘‘deeply dis-
turbing allegations of large-scale arbitrary de-
tentions of Uighurs and other Muslim commu-
nities, in so-called re-education camps across
Xinjiang’’.
(20) On September 18, 2018, the Washington
Post editorial board wrote, ‘‘At stake is not just
the welfare of the Uighurs, but also whether the

technologies of the 21st century will be employed
to smother human freedom.’’
(21) In December 2018 testimony before the
Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and
International Cybersecurity Policy of the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, Dep-
uty Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human
Rights and Labor Scott Busby testified that the
number of those detained in camps since April
2017 was ‘‘at least 800,000 and possibly more
than 2 million’’.
(22) In December 2018, independent media re-
ports pointed to growing evidence of forced
labor in the camps, as well as reports of individ-
uals who have been released from camps being
forced to labor in nearby factories for low wages
under threat of being sent back to ‘‘political re-
education’’ camps.
(23) In December 2018 and January 2019, Chi-
nese officials organized visits to ‘‘political re-
education’’ camps in Xinjiang for a small group
of foreign journalists and diplomats from 12
non-Western countries. In the months preceding
the visits, international media reported that of-
ficials worked to remove security features from
some ‘‘political reeducation’’ facilities, and
coached detainees and area residents not to
make negative comments about the camps. Re-
ports also indicated that officials had trans-
ferred large numbers of detainees to detention
facilities in other parts of China.
(24) Experts have described the Xinjiang re-
gion as ‘‘a police state to rival North Korea,
with a formalized racism on the order of South
African apartheid’’ and the repression in the
Xinjiang region as a ‘‘slow motion Tiananmen’’.
(25) On December 31, 2018, President Donald
J. Trump signed into law the Asia Reassurance
Initiative Act of 2018 (Public Law 105–409),
which condemned China’s ‘‘forced disappear-
ances, extralegal detentions, invasive and omni-
present surveillance, and lack of due process in
judicial proceedings,’’ authorized funding to
promote democracy, human rights, and the rule
of law in China, and supported sanctions des-
ignations against any entity or individual
that—
(A) violates human rights or religious free-
doms; or
(B) engages in censorship activities.
SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) the President should condemn abuses
against Turkic Muslims by Chinese authorities
in Xinjiang and call on Chinese President Xi
Jinping to recognize the profound abuse and
likely lasting damage of China’s current poli-
cies, and immediately close the ‘‘political reedu-
cation’’ camps, lift all restrictions on and ensure
respect for internationally guaranteed human
rights across the region, and allow for reestab-
lishment of contact between those inside and
outside China;
(2) the United States Government should de-
velop a strategy to support the United Nations
High Commissioner for Human Rights and nu-
merous United Nations Special Rapporteurs’ ur-
gent calls for immediate and unfettered access to
Xinjiang, including the ‘‘political reeducation’’
camps, and instruct representatives of the
United States at the United Nations to use the
voice and vote of the United States to condemn
the mass arbitrary detainment, torture, and
forced labor of Turkic Muslims in the People’s
Republic of China;
(3) the Secretary of State should consider the
applicability of existing authorities, including
the Global Magnitsky Act (subtitle F of Public
Law 114–328), to impose targeted sanctions on
members of the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China, the Chinese Communist Party,
and state security apparatus, including
Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo and
other officials credibly alleged to be responsible
for human rights abuses in Xinjiang and else-
where;
(4) the Secretary of State should fully imple-
ment the provisions of the Frank Wolf Inter-
national Religious Freedom Act (Public Law
114–281) and consider strategically employing
sanctions and other tools under the Inter-
national Religious Freedom Act (22 U.S.C. 6401
et seq.) and to employ measures required as part
of the ‘‘Country of Particular Concern’’ (CPC)
designation for the Government of the People’s
Republic of China that directly address particu-
larly severe violations of religious freedom;
(5) the Secretary of Commerce should review
and consider prohibiting the sale or provision of
any United States-made goods or services to any
state agent in Xinjiang, and adding the
Xinjiang branch of the Chinese Communist
Party, the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau,
and the Xinjiang Office of the United Front
Work Department, or any entity acting on their
behalf to facilitate the mass internment or
forced labor of Turkic Muslims, to the ‘‘Entity
List’’ administered by the Department of Com-
merce;
(6) United States companies and individuals
selling goods or services or otherwise operating
in Xinjiang should take steps, including in any
public or financial filings, to publicly assert
that their commercial activities are not contrib-
uting to human rights violations in Xinjiang or
elsewhere in China and that their supply chains
are not compromised by forced labor;
(7) the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
appropriate United States law enforcement enti-
ties should track and take steps to hold ac-
countable officials from China who harass,
threaten, or intimidate not only United States
citizens and legal permanent residents, includ-
ing Turkic Muslims, Uyghur-Americans, and
Chinese-Americans, but also Chinese nationals
legally studying or working in the United
States;
(8) the Secretary of State should work with
traditional United States allies and partners to
take similar steps and coordinate closely on tar-
geted sanctions and visa restrictions;
(9) the Secretary of State should appoint a
United States Special Coordinator for Xinjiang,
from officers and employees of the Department
of State, who will coordinate diplomatic, polit-
ical, public diplomacy, financial assistance,
sanctions, counterterrorism, security resources,
and congressional reporting requirements within
the United States Government to respond to the
gross violations of universally recognized
human rights occurring in the Xinjiang region,
including by addressing—
(A) the mass detentions of Uyghurs and other
predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities;
(B) the deployment of technologically ad-
vanced surveillance and police detection meth-
ods; and
(C) the counterterrorism and counter-radi-
calism claims used to justify the policies of the
Government of the People’s Republic of China
in Xinjiang;
(10) the United States Special Coordinator for
Xinjiang position should continue until the
mass surveillance and internment of Uyghurs
and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minori-
ties has ended and all detainees released; and
(11) the full and timely implementation of sec-
tions 408, 409, and 410 of the Asia Reassurance
Initiative Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–409) is
critical to demonstrating unwavering support by
the United States for the universally recognized
human rights of all ethnic, cultural, and reli-
gious minorities in China, including Muslim mi-
norities in Xinjiang.

TRIBUTE TO CRESCENTA
VALLEY’S 135TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 11, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the community of Crescenta Valley,
California upon its 135th anniversary.
The Crescenta Valley is comprised of the
communities of La Cañada Flintridge, La
Crescenta, Montrose, Glendale, Sunland, and
Tujunga. For well over a century, this pictur-
esque valley has grown and prospered, and
today is a prominent suburb of Los Angeles
nestled between the San Gabriel and Verdugo
Mountains and the San Rafael Hills.
The valley was originally populated by Na-
tive Americans before Don Jose Maria
Verdugo, namesake of the surrounding hills,
was granted 36,000 acres by the Spanish
Crown in 1784. Don Verdugo eventually went
bankrupt, and the homeless thieves and ban-
dits of the foothills who roved the area shared
his namesake and were called ‘‘verdugos.’’
Nearly a century later in the early 1880’s,
Dr. Benjamin Briggs from Indiana moved to
Southern California and purchased land in the
valley, subdividing and selling 10-acre parcels,
with the intent to establish a hospital for lung
disease due to the clean, dry air. Dr. Briggs
chose the name ‘‘La Crescenta’’ for the valley,
noticing the crescent shapes of the mountains
from the windows of his home. Although Dr.
Briggs did not live to realize all his plans,
other physicians and health workers followed
his lead establishing health clinics and sanitar-
iums; eventually yielding to the establishment
of vineyards, orchards, and resort homes.
With the advent of an electric trolley line in
1913 which connected Crescenta Valley to
Glendale and Los Angeles, small family
homes began to evolve, a precursor of the
thriving suburban neighborhoods that populate
the valley today. In the 1930’s, the Crescenta
Valley experienced a major calamity when a
massive flash flood struck on New Year’s Day
that took forty lives, and left hundreds home-
less. Despite this tragedy, the Crescenta Val-
ley grew rapidly, developing into an estab-
lished, mainstream suburbia, and the 210 free-
way that was built in the 1970’s allowed dis-
tant communities to connect, incorporating
Crescenta Valley even further into the fabric of
Los Angeles.
The Crescenta Valley has flourished and
has found its place as a distinguished part of
the greater Los Angeles community. It con-
tains many scientific, cultural, and historical
highlights, from the beauty of Descanso Gar-
dens to the world-renowned Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
I ask all Members to join me in congratu-
lating the Crescenta Valley upon its 135th an-
niversary.
IN RECOGNITION OF ROBERT
BARBIERI ON HIS INDUCTION
INTO THE LUZERNE COUNTY
SPORTS HALL OF FAME
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 11, 2019
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor former athlete and North-
eastern Pennsylvania native, Robert Barbieri.
This year, Bob was inducted into the Luzerne
County Sports Hall of Fame at the 35th annual
dinner on August 11, 2019 for his distinct ath-
letic achievements in the sport of football.
Each year, the Luzerne County Sports Hall
of Fame honors those who have brought rec-
ognition to the state of Pennsylvania through
their outstanding achievements and contribu-
tions in athletic endeavors.
Bob started his athletic career at Old Forge
High School where he was All-Scholastic in
football and basketball. Bob played as an of-
fensive lineman, linebacker, and place kicker,
once converting 21 straight placements.
After high school, Bob continued playing
football at The George Washington University.
He was a starting offensive lineman and line-
backer from his sophomore year on. During
his time at GW, Bob was asked to play in the
North-South College All-Star game.
When his college playing days were over,
Bob first tried out for the Baltimore Colts. He
then moved back to Northeastern Pennsyl-
vania to pursue his passion in a different way.
Bob coached the Pittston High School football
team where he was highly regarded. During
his coaching career from 1966 to 1998, he
had a record of 159 wins, 100 losses, and 4
ties. His Patriots won 5 Wyoming Valley Con-
ference A Division Championships and tied for
one Eastern Conference Championship with
Shikellamy in 1967. The 1967 team was
undefeated, with a 10–0 record during the
season before facing Shikellamy in a hard-
fought championship game that ended in a
scoreless tie. Bob was a two-time Coach of
the Year (1974 and 1981), and he also
coached the UNICO team twice (1970 and
1985).
While at Pittston Area, he also coached
girls’ basketball, boys’ basketball, junior high
basketball, swimming, and junior high track.
For his outstanding efforts and career, the ath-
letic field house located in Charlie Tippi Sta-
dium was named the Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Barbieri
Field House in 2014.
It is an honor to recognize Bob on his induc-
tion into the Luzerne County Sports Hall of
Fame. May his story and athletic career serve
as an inspiration to the next generation of
Pennsylvania athletes striving for excellence.
IN REMEMBRANCE OF THOSE LOST
AND THOSE WHO GAVE AND
RISKED THEIR LIVES DURING
THE TERRORIST ATTACKS
LAUNCHED AGAINST THE
UNITED STATES ON SEPTEMBER
11, 2001
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 11, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, on
this, the 18th anniversary of the attack
launched against the United States on Sep-
tember 11, 2001, I rise to remember the vic-
tims of that horrific tragedy and those first-re-
sponders who risked, and in too many cases,
sacrificed their lives to rescue the occupants
of the besieged World Trade Center Towers.
The morning of September 11, 2001 is, and
will always be, a day like no other.
It is a day all living Americans will remem-
ber because not since Pearl Harbor had there
been such a dastardly and deadly attack on
American soil.
Eighteen years later, my heart still grieves
for those who perished on flights United Air-
lines 93, American Airlines 77, American Air-
lines 11, and United Airlines 175.
When the sun rose on the morning of Sep-
tember 11, none of us knew that it would end
in an inferno in the magnificent World Trade
Center Towers in New York City and the Pen-
tagon and in the grassy fields of Shanksville,
Pennsylvania.
I stand here remembering those who still
suffer, whose hearts still ache over the loss of
so many innocent and interrupted lives.
My prayer is that for those who lost a father,
a mother, a husband, a wife, a child, or a
friend will in the days and years ahead take
comfort in the certain knowledge that they
have gone on to claim the greatest prize, a
place in the Lord’s loving arms.
And down here on the ground, their memory
will never die so long as any of the many of
us who loved them lives.
Madam Speaker, I watched as the first, and
then the second, plane flew into the World
Trade Center and was horrified when the
buildings came down.
I was in The Capitol and saw the billowing
smoke from the wreckage at the Pentagon
and was told about the missing third plane
that met its fiery end in the empty fields of
Shanksville, Pennsylvania thanks to the self-
less act of patriotic and heroic Americans.
But as hard as it is to believe, out of a trag-
edy so overwhelming and horrific, something
good and great emerged in the aftermath of
September 11.
On that day there were no Republicans or
Democrats.
There were no Northerners or Southerners
or West or East Coasters.
We were not Red State or Blue State.
We were all simply Americans.
On that day, we were united in our shock
and anger and sadness.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1128 September 11, 2019
We were united in our resolve to defend our
country and protect the freedoms that has
made America the greatest country in the his-
tory of the world.
Later that day, I joined scores of my col-
leagues on the East Steps of the Capitol
where we sang ‘God Bless America’, lit can-
dles, held hands, and prayed for our country
and its leaders.
In the days ahead, I travelled to New York
City to visit first responders and victims still re-
covering bodies and rescuing victims of the at-
tacks and became a charter member of the
Committee on Homeland Security to ensure
that 9–11 never again happens in America.
A united America can never be defeated as
Operation Enduring Freedom showed.
The brave and valiant armed forces of the
United States swiftly toppled the Taliban and
liberated Afghanistan, making good on the
pledge that ‘‘[w]hether the terrorists are
brought to justice or justice is brought to the
terrorists, justice will be done.’’
And though he ran and hid for almost ten
years, Osama bin Ladin could not hide forever
and evade the long arm of American justice,
which, under the leadership of President
Barack Obama, caught up with him on May 2,
2011.
Madam Speaker, Americans take care of
their own.
Americans cherish freedom. Americans
cherish liberty.
And Americans want peace.
Not just for themselves alone, but all per-
sons in every corner of the globe.
Madam Speaker, ensuring that America is
safe and secure and protected from another
attack on American soil is the least we owe to
the heroic passengers on Flight 93 and to the
brave firefighters of the FDNY and officers of
the NYPD and the officers and civilians we
lost in the Pentagon who gave faithful service
to our nation.
Americans want their country to remain
safe, free, and invulnerable to another cow-
ardly attack like the one we witnessed eight-
een years ago today.
We owe that much to the Americans who
lost and gave their lives.
We owe it to them to ensure that their chil-
dren and loved ones will never again experi-
ence such pain, suffering, and loss.
We can do this. We must do this. After all,
we are Americans.

IN REMEMBRANCE ON THE 18TH
ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11
HON. PETER T. KING
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 11, 2019
Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in memory of all the lost lives and
families of 9/11, on the 18th anniversary with
a poetic tribute penned by Albert Carey
Caswell. Sadly, we are living daily with the
second wave on 9/11 with the loss of all those
magnificent responders who stayed on to help
recover our lost loved ones. Our prayers go
out to them and their families on this day.
And on this day . . .
We gather and pray, forgetting not all those
who’ve paid . . .
But, with their most precious lives on that
day, and continue to in every way . . .
With the price so grave . . .
And for all of their loved ones living and the
lost,
who now lie in such cold quiet graves the
cost . . .
And the ones whose precious bodies we could
not bury nor save . . .
Oh how the tears come our way,
wishing somehow to each heart remorse con-
vey . . .
Our thoughts and prayers go with them in
their pain each day . . .
As we add new names to this list that which
evil gave . . .
With more and more Heroes going to their
graves . . .
All in the aftermath of 9/11 and in its second
wave . . .
Were all those heroes who dug in deep,
to find our most precious loved ones while in
the midst this evil speaks . . .
All so their loved ones could find solace,
and bury their loved ones in the earth deep
down beneath . . .
On this day to stop and pray to these hearts
which speak . . .
And give thanks and remembrance for all
and each . . .
The families who can not be repaid . . .
God Is Good and God Is Great, all in such
magnificent heroes he creates . . .
For such selflessness there can be no greater
gift then this . . .
Then, all of those Gotham Hearts who stood
so courageously on that day we miss
. . .
And laid down their lives illuminating our
souls in the light of hope’s golden rays
. . .
With rays of hope and faith and courage and
glory to our children we must convey
. . .
And now all of the new battles which lie
ahead,
for all of those who stayed on the site who
too now blood must shed . . .
Trying to give closure to the families,
so their loved ones could be lowered into
such solemn graves . . .
As its for them and all of their loved ones in
this new battle pray . . .
And for all those innocents who died just be-
cause they went to work that day . . .
We Can Not and Will Never Forget . . .
As like them too we must face each new day
. . .
With the determination and grit and courage
as they . . .
To live our lives but For The Greater Good
each day . . .
As we have built in their honor this magnifi-
cent shrine upon hearts which stays
. . .
Which rises out of the ashes of hate in its
light up towards heaven in time . . .
So very splendid and so very fine . . .
That which now will so surely stand the test
of time . . .
So that from generation to generation all of
our children will find . . .
The answer to winning the battle against
evil in its darkest of times . . .
Goodness, Evil, Darkness, Light, those brave
hearts who evil must fight . . .
Who bring their light, together enjoined as
we battle on into that dark night . . .
And that The Darkness is no match for The
Light . . .
As we pray our souls be filled with such hope
and such faith as they so bright . . .
Knowing full well that time does not heal
all,
only up in Heaven when out to us our love
ones call . . .
When, once again together again . . .
Let us find peace, let us find rest, let us
mend with our Lord us to bless . . .
And watch over all of the families in their
battle in the second wave 9/11’s direst
. . .
And all of the families who lost loved ones
and gave all in death . . .
As we thank and remember all of America’s
Best . . .
ON THIS DAY . . .
In memory of all those beautiful people who
lost their lives and their loved ones on
9/11, and still lose more
today in
the second wave of 9/11’s tragedy. May God
Bless them all and hold them in palm
of his hands . . .
WE WILL NEVER FORGET!

TRIBUTE TO J’S MAINTENANCE
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 11, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor and congratulate the Waldheim family
upon the 50th anniversary of J’s Maintenance
in Glendale, California.
For over a half a century, J’s Maintenance
has provided clients with superb commercial
janitorial services and is an outstanding exam-
ple of a family-owned business that cares
about their customers’ satisfaction, their staff’s
wellbeing and their community.
Ed and Linda Waldheim bought the small
janitorial service company in 1969 and re-built
it essentially from the ground up. They have
had clients ranging from individual residences
to large companies like J.C. Penney and
Sears. Their son, Chris Waldheim, currently
runs the company. Under Chris’s leadership,
the company has set a great example by con-
ducting their business in an environmentally
friendly way, from installing solar panels on
their roof to using green chemicals for their
cleaning services. Additionally, J’s Mainte-
nance has implemented a recycling program
that has saved thousands of pounds of waste
from entering our landfills.
In addition to their business success, the
Waldheim family also exemplifies what it
means to be civic leaders. The family supports
Relay for Life, which raises funds for the
American Cancer Society to conduct research
and provide services to patients while in treat-
ment and are avid supporters of the Crescenta
Valley and Montrose Chambers of Commerce.
J’s Maintenance has also invested in the local
schools in the Crescenta Valley area by spon-
soring activities like Clark Magnet High
School’s robotics team and fundraising for
Crescenta Valley High School’s prom. Most
notably, however, is Chris’s support for and in-
volvement with the YMCA of the Foothills. He
served as a board member for several years,
holding leadership positions, chaired the Com-
munity Support Campaign for three years, and
he and his family continuously support the
YMCA’s events. In 2011, Chris was awarded
the Pat Aho Volunteer of the Year Award for
his long-lasting involvement with the YMCA.
Our community has greatly benefited from
the hard work and dedication of the Waldheim
family and their business, J’s Maintenance. I
ask all Members to join with me in congratu-
lating the Waldheim family upon the 50th anni-
versary of J’s Maintenance.

RECOGNIZING D. M. BOWMAN’S 60
YEARS IN BUSINESS
HON. DAVID J. TRONE
OF MARYLAND
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 11, 2019
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I would like
to take this opportunity to recognize D. M.
Bowman, Inc., a transportation and logistics
company based in Williamsport, Maryland.
This company has used innovation and work
ethic to make its mark on the trucking world.
In 1996, D. M. Bowman Founder and Chair-
man Don Bowman designated this week as
Driver Appreciation Week, an annual event
celebrating the hard work drivers do every
day. This year, I am honored to highlight the
achievements of his incredible company and
recognize our nation’s truck drivers, who pro-
vide all Americans a great service.
This year, D. M. Bowman is celebrating 60
years in business. Throughout this time, the
company has been an invaluable source of
economic development and jobs for Mary-
land’s Sixth District. Although the business
began as a one-man operation, due to Don
Bowman’s determination and expertise, it
quickly began to pick up speed. Now, D. M.
Bowman has an exceptional fleet of 382
power units and 8 terminals on the east coast.
As the company grew, so did its outreach
efforts. Today, D. M. Bowman works with Ha-
gerstown Community College Driving School
to help individuals who obtain their commercial
driver’s licenses find new career opportunities.
On behalf of the residents of Maryland’s
Sixth Congressional District, I thank D. M.
Bowman and its dedicated team for all that
they have done for our community and recog-
nize the 112,900 people employed by the
trucking industry in our great state.

RECOGNIZING DISTINGUISHED
PUBLIC SERVANT, MARGOT
BESTER
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 11, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize a distin-
guished public servant, Margot Bester, who,
after nearly 25 years of dedicated service to
the American people, is retiring from her posi-
tion as Principal Deputy Chief Counsel at the
Transportation Security Administration (TSA).
Ms. Bester has served as second in com-
mand of the Office of Chief Counsel since the
months following the creation of TSA, a com-
ponent of the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity created by Congress to ensure transpor-
tation security for our nation in the wake of the
9/11 terrorist attacks which occurred 18 years
ago today.
In coordination with the Chief Counsel, Ms.
Bester has overseen the legal work of the at-
torneys at TSA and has been primarily re-
sponsible for the day-to-day operations of the
Office of Chief Counsel.
Ms. Bester joined the TSA Office of Chief
Counsel in April 2002. In August of that year,
she was selected by Admiral James Loy, then
Under Secretary of Transportation for Security,
to represent TSA in its transition to DHS. She
also served as the transportation security advi-
sor to DHS Under Secretary Asa Hutchinson.
In recognition of her service to the newly
formed Department, Ms. Bester received the
Department of Homeland Security ‘‘Day One’’
Award.
Early in her career, she was Director of
Regulatory Relations with the United States
Telephone Association and an attorney with
the Federal Communications Commission.
A first-generation American, Ms. Bester was
born in Buffalo, NY, to parents that had been
granted asylum in our country after surviving
the atrocities of the Second World War. Love
of country and the importance of being an ac-
tive, engaged citizen were ingrained at a
young age. Ms. Bester has often spoken of
the great honor of serving, protecting, and giv-
ing back to our nation, which provided oppor-
tunity and security for her family during dire
circumstances.
Her passion for public service is second
only to her dedication to her family. Of her
many accomplishments, Ms. Bester is most
proud as a mother to her sons, Brian and Eric,
and as grandmother to Chase and Ava.
After spending a career protecting our Na-
tion’s transportation security, Ms. Bester now
heads to an extremely well-deserved retire-
ment from Federal service. I ask my col-
leagues to join me in sending the very best
wishes and congratulations of the House as
well as our thanks for her remarkable career
and her notable service to our country.

YMCA Youth Director. He established a local
indoor premier soccer program with more than
two-thousand participants, while also working
with the Pennsylvania Department of Natural
Resources to start a YMCA program located
in a state park.
From June 1986 to April 1994, Jim served
as the Wilkes-Barre YMCA Program Execu-

HON. JENNIFER WEXTON
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 11, 2019
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor my constituent, Mr. Steven S. Smith,

ministration, after 24 years of law enforcement
service, culminating as Supervisory Special
Agent assigned to the Pharmaceutical Inves-
tigations Section as the Group Supervisor for
Mobile Diversion Team One (MDT–1) based in
Springfield, Virginia.
Supervisory Special Agent (SSA) Steven
Smith entered on duty with the Drug Enforce-
ment Administration (DEA) on March 15, 1995
in Miami, Florida. SSA Smith was first as-
signed to the Los Angeles Field Division. Dur-
ing his fifteen-year tenure in Los Angeles, then
Special Agent (SA) Smith worked in enforce-
ment groups targeting methamphetamine pro-
duction and trafficking, and Asian heroin dis-
tribution. Working in a multi-agency environ-
ment at the Southern California Drug Task
Force and LAX Group Three, SA Smith co-
ordinated surveillance operations with over a
dozen different law enforcement agencies
while supporting Title III investigations. While
investigating narcotics and money couriers
passing through LAX airport, SA Smith’s intel-
ligence background in both law enforcement
and the military enabled him to rapidly link de-
tained suspects to active federal, state, and
local criminal investigations around the country
and build partnerships which enhanced the
quality of the LAX–G3 cases.
In August 2010, SA Smith transferred to the
Las Vegas District Office as a member of the
Tactical Diversion Squad (TDS). While as-
signed to the Las Vegas TDS, SA Smith led
an investigation targeting a doctor and an
international organized crime ring responsible
for the distribution of tens of thousands of pre-

the seizure of over 8000 d.u. of oxycodone,
$58,000 U.S. currency, and evidence identi-

During his tenure at the Las Vegas TDS, SA
Smith’s investigations brought money laun-
dering charges, substantial monetary civil pen-
alties, and regulatory sanctions to bear along
with Title 21 violations against DEA registrants
and diversion drug trafficking organizations
(DTOs).
In November 2012, SA Smith was promoted
to Group Supervisor (GS) of the Oakland
Resident Office TDS with an area of responsi-
bility which included over 50,000 DEA reg-
istrants in 15 counties of northern coastal Cali-
fornia. GS Smith enhanced the mission effec-
tiveness of the group by directing major en-
forcement initiatives at high value targets with-
in the TDS Area of Responsibility (AoR). Asset
seizures from his group increased nearly four-
fold from $510,180 to $1,989,741, which en-
abled GS Smith to persuade local agencies to
double the number of investigators assigned
as Task Force Officers to the TDS. Under SA
Smith’s leadership, Oakland TDS investiga-
tions charged eight doctors and three physi-
cian’s assistants with criminal offenses and
put them out of business for good.
Prior to employment with the DEA, Super-
visory Special Agent (SSA) Smith served on
Active Duty as an Army Reserve Military Intel-
ligence Officer at the South Florida Investiga-
tive Support Center (now the South Florida
HIDTA Intelligence Center). SSA Smith served
in Iraq under the U.S. Army V.Corps during
the 2003 invasion. SSA Smith maintained staff
oversight of all tactical human intelligence op-
erations in theatre while serving as the CJTF–
7 Task Force Counterintelligence Coordination
Authority charged with the de-confliction of all
counterintelligence operations in the Iraqi The-
atre of Operations. SSA Smith holds a Bach-
elor of Science in Criminal Justice from Florida
International University and currently resides
in Loudoun County with his wife and two chil-
dren.
I am proud to represent Mr. Smith in Con-
gress and I thank him and his family for their
honorable service to our nation with the United
States Army. Madam Speaker, I ask my col-
leagues to join me in congratulating Mr. Smith
as he concludes a distinguished career in pub-

IN RECOGNITION OF AMBASSADOR
RONALD N. WEISER AND THE
OPENING OF THE WEISER DIPLO-
MACY CENTER
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 11, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the work of Ambassador
Ronald N. Weiser in so many arenas but
today specifically for his leadership in launch-
ing the Weiser Diplomacy Center at the Ger-
ald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the Uni-
versity of Michigan.
The Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy
at the University of Michigan is America’s first
graduate public service training program.
Since 1914, the Ford School has been teach-
ing students how to address the public’s most
pressing concerns by using research and cut-
ting-edge problem-solving methodologies to
develop actionable policy solutions. The Ford
School is renowned for its quantitative anal-
ysis of a wide-range of policy issues, making
the school a frequent destination for distin-
guished policymakers from around the world.
Thanks to the wisdom and understanding of
University of Michigan alumni and Regent
Ronald Weiser and his wife Eileen, the Weiser
Diplomacy Center was established at the Ger-
ald R. Ford School of Public Policy in January
2019. The Weiser Diplomacy Center provides
a forum for leading diplomats and foreign pol-
icy experts to gather and offer practical train-
ing sessions and simulations to students to
supplement their studies. The center will bring
a diverse cadre of seasoned diplomats and
foreign policy experts to campus. This year
alone, the center will successfully connect stu-
dents with distinguished leaders like
Condoleezza Rice, Hillary Clinton, and
Samantha Power, to name a few. In addition,
the center sponsors a program for Weiser Di-
plomacy Fellows and helps students find in-
ternships pertaining to foreign affairs. The cen-
ter will include lessons for students to practice
international diplomacy and opportunities to
learn from diplomats from around the world.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring Ambassador Ronald N. Weiser
for his dedication to the Gerald R. Ford School
of Public Policy. The immediate success of the
center is due in no small part to his work and
tremendous leadership. Ambassador Weiser’s
own experience has demonstrated to him the
importance of preparing students in a quickly
shifting foreign policy world through engage-
ment with experts. The Weiser Diplomacy
Center will be an invaluable resource not only
for the students participating, but to our coun-
try as it trains the leaders of the future. This
new diplomacy center will be critical for young
people to engage with members of the foreign
policy community and inspire a new genera-
tion of the importance of this field.

IN HONOR OF THE 40TH
ANNIVERSARY OF GLENDI
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 11, 2019
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Glendi, a
Greek festival held annually in my hometown
of Manchester, NH. Over the past four dec-
ades, St. George’s Greek Orthodox Cathedral
has hosted this event, which celebrates Greek
culture, crafts, music, and, of course, food
Every year, Glendi brings together thou-
sands of people from across New Hampshire
and the region to celebrate the contributions
and traditions of Greek culture in America. I
grew up and remain a member of the St.
George’s family, which for over 100 years has
welcomed the faithful to gather and be part of
this tight-knit community. Now as a member of
Congress I could not be more proud to mark
this milestone.
My great-grandfather Arthur Papathanasiou
left Livadi, Elassona, a tiny hilltop town in
Turkish-occupied northern Greece, to start a
better life in 1906, and like many Greek immi-
grants, his family brought their culture and
food and traditions with them.
As a life-long resident of Manchester, Glendi
was always a highlight and the chance to see
those traditions and culture on display was
particularly special. There is truly no better
celebration of the many contributions the
Greek community have made in the greater
Manchester area than Glendi.
By sharing our Greek traditions with the
broader Manchester community, the festival
makes our city more inclusive and open.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to
thank George Copadis—President of the
Board of Directors, Father Mike, and the St.
George’s community for their decades of dedi-
cation to our community. I congratulate them
on this milestone and thank them for all that
they do to make our state such a wonderful
place to learn, live, and eat.

IN RECOGNITION OF ANGELINE
‘‘ANGIE’’ NANNI
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 11, 2019
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Angeline ‘‘Angie’’ Nanni for
her critical role in the once highly classified
Venona Project breaking encrypted Soviet
communications. Angie, with her unparalleled
gift for numbers and analytical thinking, dedi-
cated her career to breaking codes to maintain
the safety and security of the United States
during the Cold War.
Born August 2, 1918 in the small town of
Blairsville, PA, Angie was expected to work in
her sisters’ beauty salon. Not passionate
about being a beautician, she ran the busi-
ness side of the shop. However, during the
end of WWII, Angie and her sisters set off to
Washington, D.C. to help with the war effort.
Once the war was over, Angie decided to stay
near the capital. When the opportunity to take
an exam for a government job arose, she de-
cided to take it.
Angie, one of the only non-college educated
women taking the coded exam, not only
passed with flying colors, but also was the first
person to finish the exam. Her natural affinity
for numbers allowed her to strip down the
codes and extract the pertinent information.
Angie joined the female-dominated coalition of
cryptanalysts based in Arlington, Virginia post.
Described as a ‘‘needle-in-a-haystack ability,’’
Angie’s job was to match messages coming
from two distinct channels, accessing vital in-
formation from what were thought to be un-
breakable Soviet codes.
During the era of McCarthyism and blind ac-
cusations, there was a secret group of women
who held more confidential knowledge than
any branch of government so close to their
chests that not even their family members
knew the details of their jobs. Angie worked
for the Venona Project until it ended in 1980.
At her retirement party, nobody knew from
what job she was retiring.
Due to her hard work, in addition to the
other members of the Venona Project, many
encrypted messaged from the KGB were able
to be deciphered. Some of the most notable
codes Angie helped break were names for
many prominent players of the era, including
President Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, The
Manhattan Project, Julius Rosenberg, and
Washington, D.C.

RECOGNIZING FORMER CAPITOL
HILL STAFFERS
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 11, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize a group of former Capitol Hill
staffers who will gather in Washington on Sep-
tember 20–22 to celebrate 40 years of bipar-
tisan friendship.
Whether competing in softball and flag foot-
ball matchups, celebrating victories over burg-
ers at the Tune Inn, Christmas caroling with
Leader Michel and his colleagues, enjoying
weekend road trips to national parks and his-
toric sites, there were always respectful and
lively debates on the issues of the day. Ac-
cordingly, this group of friends shares a spe-
cial bond that began right here in these hal-
lowed halls and continues today.
Many of these congressional staffers began
their careers in 1979, working over the years
for the following Members: Representatives
Wendell Bailey, Larry Craig, Dan Crane, Phil
Crane, Ed Derwinski, David Emery, Billy Lee
Evans, Joe Gaydos, Bo Ginn, Larry Hopkins,

Bob Michel, HAL ROGERS, Jim Slattery, Gene
Taylor, Bob Whittaker, Henry Waxman, and
Vin Weber, and Senators Jake Garn, John
Glenn, Jesse Helms, Sam Nunn, Bob Pack-
wood and Richard Stone.
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize
this lasting friendship that began right here in
the halls of Congress, and I ask my col-
leagues to join me in wishing this special
group well as they remember fondly their days
on Capitol Hill and their years of fellowship

IN RECOGNITION OF JOSEPH AN-
THONY KARCUTSKIE ON HIS IN-
DUCTION INTO THE LUZERNE
COUNTY SPORTS HALL OF FAME
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 11, 2019
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor former athlete Joseph Anthony
Karcutskie. This year, Joe was inducted into
the Luzerne County Sports Hall of Fame on
August 11, 2019 for his impressive athletic
achievements in the sport of football.
Each year, the Luzerne County Sports Hall
of Fame honors those who have brought fame
and recognition to the state of Pennsylvania
through their outstanding achievements and
contributions in athletic endeavors.
While at Wyoming Area High School, Joe
was a three-year starter in football, team cap-
tain, All-Conference, All-Scholastic, and All-
Region on defense during his junior year. Dur-
ing his senior year, he was All-Conference
and All-Scholastic on offense, defense, and as
a punter. This awe-inspiring athlete led his
team in the number of tackles, sacks, and in
punting average.
Joe’s high school career was incredibly im-
pressive, but it was only the beginning. He
continued his education at Brown University
where he started every collegiate game as
middle linebacker. During his junior year, he
was named All-American. Still rising to fame,
he was voted team captain during his senior
year and was voted All-Ivy League in 1995,
1996, and 1997. During the same year, he
was also voted All-New England. Joe still
holds the Brown record for tackles in a season
with 137, and he also holds the Brown record
for tackles in a career with 404. Joe was the
first player ever to record more than 100 tack-
les in two seasons and is still the only player
to lead the team in tackles in three consecu-
tive seasons.
Joe was named a member of Brown Univer-
sity’s 125th Anniversary Team in 2003, in-
ducted into the Wyoming Area Football Ring
of Pride in 2004, and was welcomed into the
Brown University Athletic Hall of Fame in
2014.
In addition to enjoying a prestigious athletic
career, he is currently a Vice President of In-
vestments at Wells Fargo Advisors. He also
coaches his son’s baseball team and has
been a volunteer coach for soccer and the
Wyoming Area football team.
It is an honor to recognize Joe on his induc-
tion into the Luzerne County Sports Hall of
Fame. May his story and athletic career serve
as an inspiration to the next generation of
Pennsylvania athletes striving for excellence.

DIESEL EMISSIONS REDUCTION
ACT OF 2019
SPEECH OF
HON. FRED UPTON
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, September 9, 2019
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I include in the
RECORD a letter from the DERA Coalition in
support of H.R. 1768 on the Diesel Emission
Reduction Act.
DIESEL EMISSION REDUCTION ACT (DERA)
COALITION
PLEASE SUPPORT ONE OF THE NATION’S MOST
EFFECTIVE CLEAN AIR PROGRAMS
When it comes to improving air quality for
communities across the country, one of the
most effective strategies is to replace older
heavy-duty vehicles and equipment with new
and much cleaner options. That is the goal of
the Diesel Emission Reduction Act (DERA)
program managed by U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA). We urge you to
support continuation of the program as pro-
vided under Matsui-Long reauthorization
bill (H.R. 1768) which would deliver vital air
quality improvements to your constituents.
Four out of every ten Americans reside in
a region with unhealthy air, according to
EPA. The American Lung Association esti-
mates that air quality for many regions
around the country is not improving. DERA
helps communities clean up their air by re-
placing older trucks, buses, and equipment
with newer, cleaner technologies. Replacing
just one Class 8 truck with a new model can
eliminate tons of emissions. DERA also en-
joys broad bipartisan support, along with
support from a long list of business interests
and environmental and health advocates, in-
cluding those signatories below.
According the EPA’s latest report to Con-
gress on the program issued in July of this
year, since DERA’s funding was first appro-
priated in 2008, more than 67,000 vehicles and
engines have been upgraded or replaced, de-
livering $19 billion in direct health benefits.
Those benefits include eliminating 15,490
tons of fine particles and 427,700 tons of ni-
trogen oxides, a smog forming compound.
That works out to just about the same emis-
sion reductions as taking more than 236 mil-
lion cars off the road for a year.
The program provides just enough funding
to encourage owners to make a smart invest-
ment in their purchase of cleaner and often
more fuel-efficient vehicles and equipment.
As a result, every $1 in public funds appro-
priated through the DERA program is lever-
aged with an additional $3 in nonfederal
funds, generating between $11 and $30 in pub-
lic health benefits and an additional $2 in
fuel savings.
While DERA has been around since 2008,
there still is much to be done. Heavy-duty
trucks and off-road equipment are built to
last, meaning a large fleet of older and high-
er emitting trucks remain in service. Only
four in ten trucks on the road today is
equipped with technologies to achieve the
latest near-zero tailpipe emissions standard
set by EPA. Research shows that off-road
equipment, including locomotives, are of an
even older generation technology and will be
in the field for decades to come. DERA pro-
vides the funding needed to incentivize the
replacement of those older and higher emit-
ting vehicles and equipment. The program is
voluntary, competitive, and technology neu-
tral, allowing funding to be used for projects,
advanced locally, that provide the highest
benefits for the amount of funding requested.
The Diesel Emission Reduction Act has
proved to be one of the most effective tools
to generate short-term air quality and
health benefits for local communities across
the country, but those benefits cannot be
sustained without proper funding. We en-
courage you to support extending the au-
thorization of this cost-effective and envi-
ronmentally impactful program for an addi-
tional five years as provided for under the
bill.

sociation, American Trucking Associations,

IN RECOGNITION OF W. BROOKE
YEAGER III ON HIS INDUCTION
TO THE PENNSYLVANIA SPORTS
HALL OF FAME
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 11, 2019
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor former Northeastern Pennsyl-
vania athlete W. Brooke Yeager. Brooke was
inducted into the Luzerne County Sports Hall
of Fame at their annual dinner on August 11,
2019 for his outstanding achievements in the
sport of wrestling.
Each year, the Luzerne County Sports Hall
of Fame honors those who have brought fame
and recognition to the state of Pennsylvania
through their outstanding achievements and
contributions in athletic endeavors.
During his four years at E.L. Meyers High
School, Brooke was a three-time Wilkes-Barre
City Champion. In 1958, Brooke was named a
District 2 Champion. After attending Meyers
High School, Brooke continued his education
and his dominance on the wrestling mat at
Wyoming Seminary, where he was the 1959
National Prep School Champion. Brooke went
on to study at Wilkes University, earning a
Bachelor of Science degree in secondary edu-
cation while also competing on the school’s
wrestling team. During his years at Wilkes,
Brooke won the Middle Atlantic Conference
Tournament and was the recipient of the Out-
standing Wrestler Award in 1961. In 1964,
Brooke earned second place in the Small Col-
lege Nations Tournament. Following college,
Brooke went on to wrestle with the New York
Athletic Club Wrestling Team from 1964 to
1978, earning multiple Freestyle and Greco-
Roman titles.
Not only was Brooke a superb athlete, he
was also an exceptional wrestling coach.
While at Luzerne County Community College,
Brooke coached Joel Kislin, a National Junior
College Heavyweight Champion. Brooke also
served as an assistant coach from 1972 to
1978 at Wilkes College, winning the Small
College National Championship in 1974.
Brooke has continued to bring his expertise
to his local community. He served as a high
school wrestling official for the Pennsylvania
Interscholastic Athletic Association for 37
years and as an Eastern Intercollegiate Wrest-
ing Association college official for more than
28 years. For more than 25 years, Brooke and
his wife, Libby, have volunteered with the
wrestling portion of the Keystone State
Games. Beyond wrestling, Brooke has worked
with Luzerne County Community College,
teaching general biology since 1968. Addition-
ally, for more than 20 years, Brooke was also
an adjunct faculty member at Penn State Uni-
versity Wilkes-Barre. In his community, Brooke
served on numerous boards and is a current
member of Good Shepherd Lutheran Church
in Wilkes-Barre.
It is an honor to recognize Brooke on his in-
duction to the Luzerne County Sports Hall of
Fame. May his tremendous athletic career and
service to the community be a source of inspi-
ration to future athletes in Pennsylvania.

INTRODUCTION OF THE UNITED
STATES COMMISSION ON AN
OPEN SOCIETY WITH SECURITY
ACT
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 11, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I re-
introduce the United States Commission on an
Open Society with Security Act, expressing an
idea I began working on when the first signs
of the closing of parts of our open society ap-
peared after the Oklahoma City bombing trag-
edy, well before 9/11. This bill has grown
more urgent as increasing varieties of security
throughout the country have proliferated with-
out any thought about their effect on common
freedoms and ordinary access. The bill I intro-
duce today would begin a systematic inves-
tigation that takes full account of the impor-
tance of maintaining our democratic traditions
while responding adequately to the real and
substantial threats posed by terrorism.
To be useful in accomplishing its difficult
mission, the commission would be composed
not only of military and security experts, but
for the first time, they would be at the same
table with experts from such fields as busi-
ness, architecture, technology, law, city plan-
ning, art, engineering, philosophy, history, so-
ciology and psychology. To date, questions of
security often have been left almost exclu-
sively to security and military experts. They
are indispensable participants, but these ex-
perts cannot alone resolve all the new and un-
precedented issues raised by terrorism in an
open society. In order to strike the balance re-
quired by our democratic traditions, a diverse
group needs to be working together at the
same table.
For years now, before our eyes, parts of our
open society have gradually been closed
down because of terrorism and fear of ter-
rorism, even when there are no alerts, without
regard to their effects on privacy or on an
open society. Particularly following the unprec-
edented 9/11 terrorist attack on our country,
Americans have a right to expect additional
and increased security adequate to protect
citizens against this new frightening threat.
However, people expect government to be
committed and smart enough to undertake this
awesome new responsibility without depriving
them of their personal liberty. These years in
our history will long be remembered by the
rise of terrorism in the world and in this coun-
try. As a result, American society faces new
and unprecedented challenges. We must pro-
vide ever-higher levels of security for our peo-
ple and public spaces while maintaining a free
and open democratic society. As yet, our
country has no systematic process or strategy
for meeting these challenges.
When we have been faced with unprece-
dented and perplexing issues in the past, we
have had the good sense to investigate them
deeply and to move to resolve them. Exam-
ples include the National Commission on Ter-
rorist Attacks Upon the United States (also
known as the 9–11 Commission), the Com-
mission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the
United States Regarding Weapons of Mass
Destruction (also known as the Silberman
Robb Commission) and the Kerner Commis-
sion following riots that swept American cities
in the 1960s.
The important difference in the commission
proposed by this bill is that it seeks to act be-
fore a crisis in basic freedoms gradually takes
hold and becomes entrenched. Because glob-
al terrorism is likely to be long-lasting, we can-
not afford to allow the proliferation of security
that most often requires no advance civilian
oversight or analysis of alternatives and reper-
cussions on freedom and commerce.
With only existing tools and thinking, we
have been left to muddle through, using blunt
19th century approaches, such as crude
blockades and other denials of access, or risk-
ing the right to privacy using applications of
the latest technology with little attention to pri-
vacy. The threat of terrorism to our democratic
society is too serious to be left to ad hoc prob-
lem-solving. Such approaches are often as in-
adequate as they are menacing.
We can do better, but only if we recognize
and then come to grips with the complexities
associated with maintaining a society of free
and open access in a world characterized by
unprecedented terrorism. The place to begin is
with a high-level presidential commission of
wise men and women expert in a broad spec-
trum of disciplines who can help chart the new
course that will be required to protect both our
people and our precious democratic institu-
tions and traditions.

Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the 75th anniversary of
NSF International. The organization’s wide im-
pact on global public health is worthy of com-
mendation.
The National Sanitation Foundation (NSF)
was created in 1944 at the University of Michi-
gan’s School of Public Health. At the time,
poor sanitation guidelines jeopardized the
health of American diners, and the risk of
foodborne illness continually grew. The newly-
established NSF quickly set out to develop
science-based hygiene and sanitation stand-
ards for commercial foodservice equipment to
combat the prevalence of foodborne illness.
The transparent, consensus-based process
used to develop the NSF’s first sanitation
standard is the process that is still used to de-
velop all the organization’s public health and
safety standards today.
For the past 75 years, NSF has been work-
ing diligently to anticipate, recognize, and con-
trol potential human health hazards to improve
all human health. To reflect their expanded

NSF International has 70 active public health
and safety American National Standards and
over 70 active protocols for appliances,
foodservice equipment, and drinking water fil-

Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the late coach Jane Helman.
This year, Jane was inducted into the Luzerne

BEVERLY LAHAYE—40 YEARS OF
SERVICE
HON. VICKY HARTZLER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 11, 2019
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, today I
want to commend Mrs. Beverly LaHaye of the
Concerned Women for America for the work
that she has done in inspiring millions of
women across America to defend Christian,
conservative values throughout our beloved
country.
This month marks the 40th anniversary of
this great national organization. LaHaye has
been a hero of mine and has been an inspira-
tion in my own public service.
She started as a pastor’s wife who was
serving the church and raising her family,
deeply concerned about the direction some in
our country wanted to take. After hearing other
progressive organizations claiming to speak
on behalf of all American women, LaHaye had
the courage to stand up and work with other
Christian, conservative women across America
to join together and pray for the soul of our
nation. As more women gathered and joined
the group, LaHaye became instrumental in
promoting Godly values of life and the value of
family in the public arena.
I appreciate everything she has done in
paving the way for other conservative women
to speak out, to get involved, and to never
give up. I wish her all the best in her well-de-
served retirement.

RECOGNIZING ‘‘SISTER’’ RUTH
(VANHOOSE) WEINKAUF’S 100TH
BIRTHDAY
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 11, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize Sister Ruth (Vanhoose) Weinkauf
on celebrating her 100th birthday.
Sister Ruth was born September 19, 1919
and was raised in Southern Illinois. She lived
in Winkle and Cambria before relocating to
East St. Louis. There she married the love of
her life, Loyal Weinkauf. Together they were
blessed with one daughter, Sherry.
Ruth and her sister Margaret became the
first women to host a 30-minute radio talk
show in Southern Illinois titled ‘‘Moments of
Comfort’’. Additionally, at the young age of 24,
Ruth and Margaret founded the Glad Tidings
Church of St. Claire County, Illinois. Their leg-
acy lives on 75 years later in Life Church,
which has recently relocated to Swansea, Illi-
nois.
Madam Speaker, I congratulate Ruth on her
long and successful career of preaching, min-
istering, and teaching. Ruth continues to be an
inspiration to all of us and she is deeply loved
by many. I wish her and her family continued
health and happiness.
IN RECOGNITION OF CHARLES E.
LIOTT ON HIS INDUCTION INTO
THE LUZERNE COUNTY SPORTS
HALL OF FAME
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 11, 2019
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor former athlete and North-
eastern Pennsylvania native, Charles E. Liott.
This year, Liott was inducted into the Luzerne
County Sports Hall of Fame on August 11,
2019 for his distinct athletic achievements.
Each year, the Luzerne County Sports Hall
of Fame honors those who have brought fame
and recognition to the state of Pennsylvania
through their outstanding achievements and
contributions in athletic endeavors.
Charlie showed athletic interest from a very
young age. He started off playing Little
League in 1963 and was part of the Rotary
team that won the Hazleton Little League City
Series championship. He was also an All-Star
shortstop at the Teeners level, leading his
team to a state title in 1968.
During his high school career at Hazleton
High School, Charlie was a three-year
letterman in baseball, basketball, and football.
He is one of the only Mountaineer athletes to
earn this distinction. During his high school ca-
reer, he earned an innumerable number of
awards for all three sports. He was inducted
into the Hazleton High School Sports Hall of
Fame in 2015.
Charlie attended Temple University where
he played four years of NCAA Division I foot-
ball as a defensive end. He graduated from
Temple with a bachelor’s degree in business
administration, earned a Master of Business
Administration from the University of Scranton,
and received a Doctor of Chiropractic degree
from Palmer College of Chiropractic. He re-
ceived an additional degree in Chiropractic
Neurology in 1989. He has been practicing at
Liott Back & Neck Care Center in Sarasota,
Florida for 37 years.
Charlie is active in his community, coaching
girls’ and boys’ basketball teams. In addition,
he also sponsors many little league soccer
and baseball teams, as well as adult baseball
teams. He has served on the Big Brothers Big
Sisters Board of Directors, sponsoring several
children. He has supported many Girls, Inc.
functions and raised funds for many years for
the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA)
through the South Sarasota Jaycees.
It is an honor to recognize Charlie on his in-
duction into the Luzerne County Sports Hall of
Fame. May his story and athletic career serve
as an inspiration to the next generation of
Pennsylvania athletes striving for excellence.

REMEMBERING THE VICTIMS OF

E1134 September 11, 2019
hearing—when a group of cowards hijacked 4
airliners in order to perpetrate the worst act of
terrorism in American history.
Nearly 700 New Jerseyans lost their lives
that day.
No-one remembers the shock, horror and
numbing sorrow more, however, than the fami-
lies and close friends of the victims.
Because it was a surprise attack, there was
no chance to fight back that day although
when Todd Beamer and other passengers
learned what happened to the Twin Towers,
Todd famously said ‘‘let’s roll’’ and they at-
tacked the terrorists on board the flight that
crashed in a Pennsylvania field.
Who can forget the courageous first re-
sponders running up the stairs of the burning
buildings—with total disregard for their own
safety—saving some at the expense of their
own lives.
On the morning of 9/11, I got a mere
glimpse—I say again, a mere glimpse—into
the sense of horror suffered by the victim’s
families when I couldn’t reach my own brother
Tom—an American Airlines 757 Captain who
often piloted Flight 11 from Logan to LA, the
flight that crashed into the North Tower.
Evacuated from the Capitol and stuck in
traffic within sight of the burning Pentagon,
cell phones were all but gridlocked. About
noon I got through. He and his flight attendant
wife Sandy were safe but were in anguish be-
cause they knew the pilots and crew on board
Flight 11.
For 18 years, the families and friends of
those who died that day and since have had
to endure their loss and a broken heart.
Both then—and now eighteen years later—
words are inadequate to convey our empathy
for those who died and for the victims’ fami-
lies.
For many, their faith in God has helped
them survive and overcome.

THERESA JENKINS
HON. MICHAEL T. McCAUL
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 11, 2019
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the life and career of Theresa Jen-
kins. My home state of Texas fosters a re-
markable music scene. One such remarkable
person I had the privilege knowing was The-
resa Jenkins. Theresa was Senior Executive
Director of the Texas Chapter of the Record-
ing Academy. In that role and throughout her
life, she was a tireless advocate for the music
community of Texas.
Theresa began her career at Recording
Academy in 2004. Soon after, the Recording
Academy, best known for the annual
GRAMMY Awards, quickly recognized her tal-
ent and within a year promoted her to Execu-
tive Director of the Texas Chapter. As the or-
ganization’s face in Texas, she had a hand in
growing the careers of many songwriters, per-
formers, producers and other music profes-
sionals in our state.
During her visits to Washington, I identified
Theresa as an unwavering advocate for the
rights of music makers. Year after year, she
would walk these halls with prominent music
makers from Texas and make the case for
passage of legislation to help creators, such
as the landmark Music Modernization Act we
passed last year. Back in Texas, Teresa led
groups to the state capital for the Texas Arts
Advocacy Day in Austin. No matter where or
when I encountered her, Theresa’s commit-
ment, energy, and passion was always evi-
dent.
She recently poured that energy and pas-
sion into creating a world-class celebration of
Texas music at the Texas Chapter’s 25th An-
niversary celebration. Sadly, Theresa was un-
able to attend the festivity in person as in De-
cember of last year, she was diagnosed with
advanced stage Esophageal cancer, and was
undergoing treatment at the time. Despite this,
Theresa continued to work for the Texas
music community, often making calls from her
hospital bed.
Though Theresa was unable to attend the
celebration, her husband Cris and daughters
Jackie and Marina were on hand to hear the
gratitude of the entire Texas music commu-
nity. As the Recording Academy’s Chair Emer-
itus, Christine Albert stated at the event:
‘‘For 15 years, Theresa has been a con-
stant—the hub of the wheel, the eye of the
hurricane, the den mother to our troop, herder
of our cats and the quarterback of our team.
She has also been a friend, advisor, and
cheerleader.
Throughout her illness, she has continued to
work on this gala as well as the ongoing ro-
bust agenda of deadlines and projects that are
involved in keeping the Recording Academy’s
mission moving forward. At the same time,
she has made countless trips to MD Anderson
in Houston, undergone chemotherapy, spent
precious time with her family and friends, and
taken care of her body, mind and spirit.
We are all together, in one room. I ask you
to generate all the love, gratitude, prayers,
healing and good juju you can find in your
hearts and send it to our good friend and fear-
less leader, Theresa Jenkins.’’
Christine’s words were conveyed to Theresa
with the prayers and good wishes of a grateful
community.
Sadly, last month, Theresa passed away.
The moving tributes from so many musicians
are a testament to the love and respect she
earned so well.
I will miss seeing Theresa leading her fellow
Texans through the Halls of Congress and the
statehouse. However, I know her legacy will
live on and that the lives of our music commu-
nity have been made better by their steadfast
champion, Theresa Jenkins.

legiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Locally,
he was also involved in the administrative side

Council and as chairman of the Police Civil

It is an honor to recognize Frank on his in-
duction into the Luzerne County Sports Hall of
Fame. May his story and athletic career serve
as an inspiration to the next generation of
Pennsylvania athletes striving for excellence.
