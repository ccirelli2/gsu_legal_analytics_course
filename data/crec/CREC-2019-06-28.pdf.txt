MORNING BUSINESS
ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, section
36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act
requires that Congress receive prior no-
tification of certain proposed arms
sales as defined by that statute. Upon
such notification, the Congress has 30
calendar days during which the sale
may be reviewed. The provision stipu-
lates that, in the Senate, the notifica-
tion of proposed sales shall be sent to
the chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
In keeping with the committee’s in-
tention to see that relevant informa-
tion is available to the full Senate, I
ask unanimous consent to have printed
in the RECORD the notifications which
have been received. If the cover letter
references a classified annex, then such
annex is available to all Senators in
the office of the Foreign Relations
Committee, room SD–423.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
DEFENSE SECURITY
COOPERATION AGENCY,
Arlington, VA.
Hon. JAMES E. RISCH,
Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Pursuant to the re-
porting requirements of Section 36(b)(5)(A) of
the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), as
amended, we are forwarding Transmittal No.
0L–19. This notification relates to enhance-
ments or upgrades from the level of sensi-
tivity of technology or capability described
in the Section 36(b)(1) AECA certification 15–
26 of April 28, 2015.
Sincerely,
CHARLES W. HOOPER,
Lieutenant General, USA, Director.
Enclosures.
TRANSMITTAL NO. 0L–19
Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensi-
tivity of Technology or Capability (Sec.
36(b)(5)(A), AECA)

Australia.
(ii) Sec. 36(b)(B)(5)(A) AECA Transmittal
No.: 15–26; Date: April 28, 2015; Military De-
partment: Navy.
(iii) Description: On April 28, 2015, Congress
was notified by Congressional certification
transmittal number 15–26 of the possible sale
under Section 36(b)(l) of the Arms Export
Control Act of follow-on sustainment sup-
port and services in support of three (3) Ho-
bart Class Destroyers. The sustainment ef-
forts include AEGIS computer software and
hardware updates, system integration and
testing, tools and test equipment, spare and
repair parts, support equipment, publica-
tions and technical documentation, per-
sonnel training and training equipment, air-
crew trainer devices upgrades, U.S. Govern-
ment and contractor technical assistance,
and other related elements of logistics and
program support. The estimated cost was
$275 million.
This transmittal reports Australia’s re-
quest to purchase upgrade kits for their
Multifunctional Information Distribution
System (MIDS) Low Volume Terminal (LVT)
equipment installed on the Hobart Class De-
stroyers. The MIDS LVT Block Upgrade 2
(BU2) kits provide a suite of hardware, soft-
ware and firmware updates for the MIDS
LVT units to provide a more robust security
and enhanced throughput (higher data rate).
The total case value will remain $275 mil-
lion.
(iv) Significance: This proposed upgrade to
the MIDS LVT will contribute to the mod-
ernization of the Royal Australian Navy Ho-
bart Class destroyers, improve the Royal
Australian Navy’s capability to conduct self-
defense and regional security missions, and
enhance its interoperability with the U.S.
and other NATO members.
(v) Justification: The proposed sale will
improve Australia’s capability in current
and future coalition efforts. Australia will
use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to
regional threats and to strengthen its home-
land defense.
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The Multi-
functional Information Distribution System-
Low Volume Terminal (MIDS–LVT) is an ad-
vanced Link–16 command, control, commu-
nications, and intelligence (C3I) system in-
corporating high-capacity, jam-resistant,
digital communication links used for ex-
change of near real-time tactical informa-
tion, including both data and voice, among
air, ground, and sea elements. The terminal
hardware, publications, performance speci-
fications, operational capability, param-
eters, vulnerabilities to countermeasures,
and software documentation are classified
CONFIDENTIAL. The classified information
to be provided consists of that which is nec-
essary for the operation, maintenance, and
repair (through intermediate level) of the
data link terminal, installed systems, and
related software.
(vii) Date Delivered to Congress: June 27,
2019.

this total.
This transmittal reports an additional con-
figuration of AGM 88–C High Speed
AntiRadiation Missiles (HARM) Tactical
Missiles, in addition to the AGM–88B and
AGM–88E HARMs previously notified. The
‘‘C’’ configuration missiles would replace up
to twenty (20) of the ‘‘B’’ configuration mis-
siles. The MDE value will remain $100 mil-
lion. The total case value will remain $137.6
million.
(iv) Significance: This proposed upgrade to
the HARM AGM 88–C will contribute to the
modernization of the Royal Australian Air
Forces (RAAF) fighter aircraft, improve the
RAAF’s capability to conduct self-defense
and regional security missions, and enhance
its interoperability with the U.S. and other
NATO members.
(v) Justification: The addition of the AGM–
88C to the RAAF inventory will further ex-
pand the RAAF’s anti-radiation strike capa-
bility. AGM–88C procurement will provide
capability for Australia to defend its inter-
ests at home and abroad.
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The major
hardware improvement from the AGM–88B to
the AGM–88C was a new WDU–37/B warhead
with 12800 tungsten alloy fragments and a re-
vised explosive charge.
(vii) Date Delivered to Congress: June 27,
2019.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION
Germany—AGM–88E AARGM Missiles
The Government of Germany has requested
to buy, through the NATO Support and Pro-
curement Agency (NSPA) acting as its
Agent, up to ninety-one (91) AGM–88E Ad-
vanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile
(AARGM) Tactical Missiles, and up to eight
(8) AGM–88E AARGM Captive Air Training
Missiles (CATM). Also included are up to six
(6) telemetry/flight termination systems,
Flight Data Recorders (FDR), U.S. Govern-
ment and contractor engineering, technical
and logistics support services and miscella-
neous support equipment, and other related
elements of logistical and program support.
The total estimated cost is $122.86 million.
This proposed sale will support the foreign
policy and national security of the United
States by helping to improve the security of
a NATO ally, which is an important force for
political and economic stability in Europe.
It is vital to the U.S. national interests that
Germany develops and maintains a strong
and ready self-defense capability.
The AGM–88E AARGM is an upgrade to the
older generation AGM–88B High-Speed
AntiRadiation Missile (HARM), which Ger-
many first purchased in 1988. The AGM–88E
AARGMs in this case will be manufactured
using a mixture of new components and older
sections from Germany’s existing stock of
AGM–88Bs provided as Government Fur-
nished Equipment (GFE). Germany will have
no difficulty absorbing this equipment and
support into its armed forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.
Germany has requested that the NSPA act
as its agent for the FMS procurement and
case management to support the AARGM
program. The principal U.S. contractor will
be NGIS, Ridgecrest, CA. The integration ef-
forts will be via a Direct Commercial Sale
(DCS), initiated by the Luftwaffe, between
the Tornado Management Agency (NETMA)
and the AARGM Original Equipment Manu-
facturer, Northrop Grumman Innovation
Systems, formerly known as Orbital ATK
(OA). There are no known offset agreements
associated with this potential sale.
Implementation of this proposed sale will
require five U.S. government personnel and
three contractor representatives to travel to
Germany to provide Program Management
Reviews. Two visits are planned per year
over the next five years.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
1. The AGM–88E Advanced Anti-Radiation
Guided Missile (AARGM) AGM–88E weapon
system is an air-to-ground missile intended
to suppress or destroy land or sea-based
radar emitters associated with enemy air de-
fenses and provides tactical air forces with a
lethal countermeasure to enemy radar di-
rected, surface-to-air missiles, and air de-
fense artillery weapons systems. Destruction
or suppression of enemy radars denies the
enemy the use of air defense systems, there-
by improving the survivability of our tac-
tical aircraft. It uses a multimode seeker
that incorporates global positioning system/
inertial measurement unit (GPS/IMU) mid-
course guidance, a radio frequency (RF) radi-
ation homing receiver, an active millimeter.
When assembled, the AGM–88E AARGM is
classified SECRET. The AARGM Guidance
Section (seeker hardware) and Control Sec-
tion with the Target Detector is classified
CONFIDENTIAL.
2. If a technologically advanced adversary
were to obtain knowledge of the specific
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system
effectiveness or be used in the development
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities.
3. A determination has been made that the
Government of Germany can provide sub-
stantially the same degree of protection for
the technology being released as the U.S.
Government. This sale supports the U.S. for-
eign policy and national security objectives
as outlined in the Policy Justification.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION
Morocco—Sustainment for F–16 Fleet
The Government of Morocco has requested
a continuation of sustainment support to its
current F–16 fleet to include the following
non-MDE components: F–16 support equip-
ment, spares and repair parts; personnel
training and training equipment; publica-
tions and technical documentation; muni-
tions support equipment (for AMRAAM,
CMBRE, JDAM, PAVEWAY), support and
test equipment; integration and test; U.S.
Government and contractor engineering,
technical and logistical support services; and
other related elements of logistics and pro-
gram support. The total estimated program
cost is $250.4 million.
This proposed sale will support the foreign
policy and national security of the United
States by helping to improve the security of
a major Non-NATO ally that is an important
force for political stability and economic
progress in North Africa.
The proposed sale will improve Morocco’s
self-defense capability. Additionally, the
continuation of sustainment for their F–16
fleet strengthens the interoperability with
the United States and other regional allies.
Morocco already operates an F–16 fleet and
this sustainment case will ensure that they
can continue operating their fleet in the fu-
ture. Morocco will have no difficulty absorb-
ing this support into its armed forces.
The proposed sale will not alter the basic
military balance in the region.
The principal contractor will be Lockheed
Martin Corporation, Bethesda, Maryland.
The purchaser typically requests offsets.
Any offset agreement will be defined in nego-
tiations between the purchaser and the con-
tractor.
Implementation of this proposed sale will
not require the assignment of additional U.S.
Government and/or contractor representa-
tives to Morocco.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.

NATIONAL DEFENSE
AUTHORIZATION ACT
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today, I
wish to discuss the importance of
strengthening the defense industrial
base, particularly as it relates to ship-
building.
On July 21, 2017, the President signed
Executive Order 13806, directing the
Department of Defense to lead a whole
of government assessment of the
health of the manufacturing and de-
fense industrial base of the United
States. The report was released on Oc-
tober 5, 2018, and outlines current risks
in the defense industrial base.
Within the military shipbuilding sec-
tor, concerns range from an overreli-
ance on single and sole source sup-
pliers, to a capacity shortfall for main-
tenance and modernization work, to in-
sufficient competition and unstable de-
mand.
The DoD report said: ‘‘Industries in-
volved in the manufacturing of ship-
building components were among the
hardest hit by the global shift in the
industrial base over the last 20 years.
Of the top ten highest grossing indus-
tries in Navy shipbuilding, six are in
the manufacturing sector. Since 2000,
these industries experienced a com-
bined decline of over 20,500 establish-
ments.’’
We cannot afford to shrink our mili-
tary shipbuilding industry any further.
These issues are particularly acute in
my State of Virginia. Not only is Vir-
ginia home to Newport News Ship-
building and Norfolk Naval Shipyard,
we have hundreds of military ship-
builder suppliers, a number of which
are considered by the Department of
Defense to be fragile. These companies
are essentially national treasures, from
Hunt Valve out of Roanoke to Jo–Kell
in Chesapeake, KITCO Fiber Optics in
Virginia Beach, and Hampton Machine
Shop in Newport News.
These companies want stability and
predictability in funding; they want to
be certain our Nation is serious about
a 355-ship Navy.
These are issues that our committee
has been working on for some time. In
testimony last fall before the Seapower
Subcommittee, the Secretary of the
Navy for Research, Development, and
Acquisition, James Geurts, told our
committee that ‘‘advanced funding and
anything we can do to help the supplier
base will drastically reduce risks going
forward. What we are seeing in most of
our construction programs as a key
risk is supplier fragility, either single
sources or single producers where we
have to ramp up production.’’
Chairman INHOFE has paid close at-
tention to those concerns, and I very
much appreciate how far this bill goes
to address the issues outlined in the in-
dustrial base report.
This bill authorizes funds for the
third year for the submarine supplier
base initiative, which is helping crit-
ical suppliers across the Nation; au-
thorizes additional funding along with
incremental funding authority for both
LPD 31 and LHA 9; accelerates the ac-
quisition of LHA 9; adds funding for ad-
vance procurement for the DDG pro-
gram; and requires DoD to assess the
savings a multiyear procurement
would yield in the LPD program, and
the savings we could achieve through a
block buy of two LHA’s. The bill also
reauthorizes CVN 75, the USS Harry S
Truman. It leaves no room for indeci-
sion on the future of this asset.
It is critical that the DOD’s current
and prospective shipbuilding programs,
the Virginia class and Columbia class
submarine programs, the new Frigate
program, destroyers, specifically take
action to maintain the domestic supply
base and not allow foreign sources to
undercut the pricing of the domestic
supply base.
We ask the administration to help us
in every way to stay focused on helping
our military shipbuilding industrial
base meet the Navy the Nation Needs.

EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL AP-
PROPRIATIONS FOR HUMANI-
TARIAN ASSISTANCE AND SECU-
RITY AT THE SOUTHERN BOR-
DER ACT
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, today I
wish to speak about S. 1900, the Emer-
gency Supplemental Appropriations for
Humanitarian Assistance and Security
at the Southern Border Act. I under-
stand there is some important funding
in the bill to deal with President
Trump’s manufactured crisis at the
U.S.-Mexico border, particularly fund-
ing for the Department of Health and
Human Services. However, I cannot in
good conscience support a bill that pro-
vides additional resources to the De-
partment of Homeland Security at a
time when we are seeing this agency
commit so many gross human rights
violations. I want to make my position
clear: I do not support this bill in its
entirety, and I would have voted
against it.
Both U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement, ICE, and U.S. Customs
and Border Patrol, CBP, have already
benefited from increased funding in fis-
cal years 2018 and 2019 and, as we have
seen, have used that funding to ramp
up their inhumane policies. Policies
like ‘‘metering’’, which forces migrants
to wait in Mexico for weeks, sometimes
months, in order to enter the United
States and claim their legal right to
asylum. We know that ‘‘metering’’ has
resulted in the deaths of families seek-
ing refuge, like Oscar Alberto Martinez
and his 23-month-old Valeria just this
week. Policies like the zero-tolerance
policy, which has separated thousands
of children from their families and con-
tinues to this day. These policies are
unacceptable and do not reflect who we
are as Americans. Everyone should be
outraged as what is happening at the
hand of this administration and DHS.
Just last week Donald Trump
tweeted that he would begin ICE depor-
tation raids across the United States.
At a time when the Trump administra-
tion is claiming that it does not have
enough money to deal with the human-
itarian crisis at the Southwest border,
it is puzzling how DHS has enough re-
sources to conduct large-scale raids all
across the United States. How is there
money for raids that would terrorize
communities yet not enough money for
providing soap, blankets, and tooth-
brushes for children in the govern-
ment’s custody?
Repeatedly, this administration has
chosen to implement policies that cost
more and are less efficient in order to
pursue its extreme immigration agen-
da. If ICE and CBP are in need of extra
funding, then they should implement
policies that save money, like further
utilizing alternatives to detention,
ATDs. The government’s own statistics

People are frightened, and they are
returning to the shadows. It is weak-
ening the safety of our communities,
and it is an affront to the ideals of the
United States. I will not support fund-
ing which further endangers the lives
of immigrants who have every right to
remain in this country and those flee-
ing violence and seeking shelter in our
country. Those of us in positions of
power have an obligation to stand up
for all people and stand against abuses
especially at the hands of our govern-
ment. Instead of rubberstamping addi-
tional funding, I will continue to do
this and hold this administration ac-
countable. Thank you.

FOREIGN ELECTION
INTERFERENCE
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I
want to discuss Russia’s sustained
campaign of attacks on our democracy
and how the President’s inability to
take these threats seriously harms our
national security and the integrity of
our elections.
In the run up to his meeting with
Russian President Vladimir Putin this
week at the G20 Summit, the President
showed no signs that he planned to
warn Russia against interfering in our
democratic elections in 2020. In press
interviews, he said that he ‘‘may’’ ask
Putin not interfere in 2020 and told an-
other group of reporters, ‘‘I will have a
very good conversation with him . . .
what I say is none of your business.’’
Following today’s meeting with
Putin, an autocrat who continues to
conduct hybrid warfare operations
against our democracy, President
Trump made light of this threat in a
joking manner. In response to a report-
er’s question, he apparently grinned as
he told Putin, ‘‘don’t meddle in our
election.’’
This is not a joke. This is about de-
terring the Kremlin from continuing to
attack our democracy. He should be
using every tool at his disposal to di-
rect a whole of government and whole
of society effort to counter these at-
tacks, not emboldening Putin to esca-
late his aggression. It is exactly the
business of the American people to
know that our elections are free from
interference and that we can trust the
President of the United States to de-
liver tough messages to deter foreign
adversaries.
Relatedly the President can’t seem
to grasp what’s wrong with accepting
‘‘dirt’’ on his political opponents from
foreign adversaries. In a recent inter-
view with ABC News, the President
made it clear that he sees nothing
wrong with compromising our national
security if it advances his own political
interests. When asked if his campaign
would accept information on his oppo-
nents from Russia, China, or other
countries during the 2020 campaign, the
President responded: ‘‘I think you
might want to listen . . . there’s noth-
ing wrong with listening.’’
He denied that this type of assistance
from a foreign adversary was inter-
ference, adding: ‘‘They have informa-
tion. I think I’d take it.’’ It was only
after being heavily criticized that
President Trump reversed course, tell-
ing Fox and Friends ‘‘Of course, you
give it to the FBI or report it to the at-
torney general or somebody like that
. . . You couldn’t have that happen in
our country.’’ But, of course, it already
happened. President Trump’s inability
or unwillingness to recognize it is both
completely wrong-headed and dan-
gerous.
The President’s response belies the
undeniable fact that Russia attacked
our democracy in the 2016 election with
an information warfare campaign, and
tried to do it again in the 2018 mid-
terms.
Trump initially made Russia’s inter-
ference sound like run of the mill, op-
position research—‘‘oppo research’’ he
called it—and claimed everyone does
it, but this is not about politics as
usual. This is about Russia advancing
its strategic interests and using tools
from its hybrid arsenal, including in-
formation warfare and malign influ-
ence operation, to do so. Russia seeks
to inject itself into our political proc-
ess to achieve its goals of promoting
the candidates favorable to Russia and
discrediting those that are not, weak-
ening the American public’s faith in
the integrity of democracy, and under-
mining the United States’ standing
globally.
President Trump’s failure to grasp
that there is a problem with someone
in his high office—or any candidate for
public office for that matter—accept-
ing dirt on political opponents from a
foreign government or national is trou-
bling on many levels, but importantly,
it harms our national security. It un-
dermines our ability as a nation to
counter Russia and other adversaries
and our ability to protect our elec-
tions. The President should be leading
a comprehensive, meaningful approach
to deter Russia and others who seek to
target our democracy. Instead, he is
announcing to the world that our elec-
tions are open to manipulation.
Some would have you believe that,
with the release of the Mueller report,
the case of Russian interference in the
2016 election is closed, that our work is
done, and that Congress can stop car-
ing about the attack on our democracy
and the integrity of our political sys-
tem. The White House, the Attorney
General, and congressional Republican
leaders are sending a coordinated mes-
sage that there is nothing to see here,
folks.
But no matter how they try, we can’t
forget that Russia attacked our democ-
racy in 2016, that Russia tried to do it
again in 2018, and that it continues to
deploy hybrid operations against us,
our allies, and our partners. Just re-
cently, a report issued by the European
Union concluded that Russia conducted
‘‘continued and sustained’’ information
warfare campaigns against the EU Par-
liamentary elections this spring. We
must continue to work to highlight
these types of findings including those
made by the special counsel and their
implications going forward. As Special
Counsel Mueller’s powerful press state-
ment from his investigation under-
scored: ‘‘there were multiple, system-
atic efforts to interfere in our elec-
tion.’’ Mueller added, ‘‘And that allega-
tion deserves the attention of every
American.’’
The special counsel’ s report and re-
lated indictments described these oper-
ations in great detail. Let’s look spe-
cifically at key aspects of the Russian
information warfare campaign that the
report laid out.
First, Mueller makes clear that
Kremlin-linked operators sought to
help the candidate the Kremlin favored
and whose election would serve Rus-
sia’s interests. The report describes
how ‘‘A Russian entity carried out a
social media campaign that favored
presidential candidate Donald J.
Trump and disparaged presidential can-
didate Hillary Clinton.’’ It also found
that ‘‘[a]s early as 2014, the [Kremlin-
linked Internet Research Agency] in-
structed its employees to target U.S.
persons who could be used to advance
its operational goals.’’
Second, Mueller describes in detail
the Russian spying operation to steal
‘‘dirt’’ on the opposition candidate and
then use that stolen information
against her. The report states un-
equivocally, ‘‘[a] Russian intelligence
service conducted computer intrusion
operations against entities, employees
and volunteers working on the Clinton
Campaign and then released stolen doc-
uments.’’
Third, the Mueller established mul-
tiple contacts by Russian Government
officials or their proxies with the
Trump campaign to establish relation-
ships. The report states: ‘‘[t]he inves-
tigation also established numerous
links between the Russian government
and the Trump campaign.’’
Finally, the Mueller report defini-
tively concludes that Russia saw its in-
terests as aligned with and served by a
Trump Presidency, that Russia con-
ducted a campaign to interfere in the
2016 election for the purpose of helping
the Trump campaign, and that the
Trump campaign hoped to benefit from
the fruits of that foreign election inter-
ference. Ultimately, however, the
Mueller investigation could not prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that the
Trump campaign or its associates con-
spired with the Russian Government in
its election interference.
As the report states: ‘‘[a]lthough the
investigation established that the Rus-
sian government perceived it would
benefit from a Trump presidency and
worked to secure that outcome, and
that the Campaign expected it would
benefit electorally from information
stolen and released through Russian ef-
forts, the investigation did not estab-
lish that members of the Trump Cam-
paign conspired or coordinated with

the Russian government in its election
interference activities.’’
As the special counsel’s report de-
tails, Trump did not shy away and, in
fact, sought to benefit from help from
Russia in the 2016 election. Trump
campaign associates, including his son,
son-in law, and campaign manager,
met with Russian agents to hear poten-
tial dirt about Secretary Clinton,
which was presented to the Donald
Trump, Jr. as ‘‘part of Russia and its
government’s support for Mr. Trump.’’
Even in hindsight, Trump said he most
likely wouldn’t have contacted the FBI
about that meeting, telling ABC News,
‘‘I have seen a lot of things over my
life. I don’t think in my whole life I’ve
ever called the FBI. In my whole life.
You don’t call the FBI.’’
Think about that statement for a
moment. Here is the President of the
United States, who has taken an oath
to faithfully execute the laws of the
United States, declaring that people
should not go to law enforcement with
evidence of foreign interference in our
political process.
But, of course, candidate Trump went
further than simply not reporting for-
eign attempts to influence our elec-
tions. The special counsel detailed how
Trump embraced the support of a for-
eign adversary by calling on Russia to
hack his political opponent and dis-
seminate the stolen information. On
July 27, 2016, Trump announced pub-
licly during a press conference, ‘‘Rus-
sia, if you are listening, I hope you’re
able to find the 30,000 emails that are
missing. I think you will be rewarded
mightily by our press.’’ The Mueller re-
port confirmed that a Russian military
intelligence unit, commonly referred
to as the GRU, tried to assist Trump
with those efforts, finding, ‘‘within ap-
proximately five hours of Trump’s
statement, GRU officers targeted for
the first time Clinton’s personal of-
fice.’’
The special counsel also detailed how
the Trump campaign ‘‘showed interest
in WikiLeaks’s releases of documents
and welcomed their potential to dam-
age candidate Clinton.’’ Furthermore,
the Trump campaign continued to pro-
mote WikiLeaks after it was apparent
that WikiLeaks was being used by the
GRU to disseminate information stolen
by the Russians. On October 7, 2016, the
Department of Homeland Security and
the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence issued a joint statement
naming the WikiLeaks disclosures as
‘‘consistent with the Russian-directed
efforts’’ to influence public opinion. If
not prior to the release of that joint
statement, certainly by that point the
President and his campaign should
have known better. Instead of calling
the FBI, the Trump campaign
strategized how to benefit from Rus-
sia’s stolen information. The Mueller
report states: ‘‘by the late summer of
2016, the Trump Campaign was plan-
ning a press strategy, a communica-
tions campaign, and messaging based
on the possible release of Clinton
emails by WikiLeaks.’’ A related in-
dictment from the special counsel de-
tailed how the Trump campaign ap-
plauded WikiLeaks’s release of John
Podesta’s emails starting on October 7,
2016. In the last month of the campaign
alone, the President publicly boasted of
his love of WikiLeaks at least 124
times.
As I mentioned, the special counsel
did not find sufficient evidence to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
the Trump campaign’s embracing of
the benefits of Kremlin or Kremlin-
linked operations constituted a crime.
But is it okay for a candidate to get
elected President, or elected to any
public office, by capitalizing on infor-
mation stolen by a foreign adversary?
Will that be acceptable the next time
around? Will foreign information war-
fare campaigns targeting our elections
be accepted as normal from now on?
Based on his public remarks, it cer-
tainly seems acceptable to President
Trump and his defenders. This is not
theoretical. It happened in 2016. Now
the President put it out there that he
would meet with foreign adversaries
again in the 2020 campaign to hear
what information they have on his op-
ponents. He is emboldened to do it
again. While, as I mentioned, he later
changed his position, it still leaves
room for doubt about his true inten-
tions and invites our adversaries to try
and compromise our election. Trump
publicly undermined his own FBI Di-
rector, Christopher Wray, who testified
in front of the Senate that, ‘‘If any
public official or member of any cam-
paign is contacted by any nation-state
or anybody acting on behalf of a na-
tion-state about influencing or inter-
fering with our election, then that’s
something that the FBI would want to
know about it.’’
When asked about Wray’s testimony,
President Trump bluntly said ‘‘The
FBI Director is wrong.’’ Trump’s state-
ments were so disturbing that the FEC
Commissioner responded by saying
‘‘Let me make something 100% clear to
the American public and anyone run-
ning for public office: It is illegal for
any person to solicit, accept, or receive
anything of value from a foreign na-
tional in connection with a U.S. elec-
tion. This is not a novel concept.’’
The President’s actions also clearly
aided ongoing Russian information
warfare operations. This is not the
standard of conduct and the public
trust that goes with political office.
The willingness to embrace a foreign
adversary in this fashion is unpatriotic
and defies the basic norms of this Na-
tion.
The Trump campaign’s series of for-
eign contacts in the 2016 election and
the President’s continued willingness
to accept assistance from a foreign
government make it clear that Con-
gress must act to prevent future inter-
ference efforts. That is why I am a co-
sponsor of the Foreign Influence Re-
porting in Elections Act, or FIRE Act,
introduced by Senator WARNER. The
FIRE Act would require all campaign
officials to report, within 1 week, any
contacts with foreign nationals at-
tempting to make campaign donations
or otherwise collaborate with the cam-
paign to the Federal Election Commis-
sion. The FEC would in turn have to
notify the FBI within 1 week. It is in
all our interest to ensure that we can
defend against foreign attacks on our
democratic institutions and reporting
these kinds of contacts to the appro-
priate authorities is our first line of de-
fense. I am disappointed that my Re-
publican colleagues blocked Senator
WARNER’s attempt to pass the FIRE
Act, even after many of them insisted
that politicians should contact the FBI
if ever contacted or offered help by a
foreign government.
This is not a Democratic or a Repub-
lican issue. This is an issue of our na-
tional security and the integrity of our
free and fair elections. Russia exploited
vulnerabilities in our open society to
advance its own interests and the Rus-
sian tactics were encouraged and am-
plified by a candidate who was seeking
our nation’s highest office. We have
every indication that the Russians are
poised to do it again, and the President
has shown time and again—including
today for the world to see—that he
doesn’t see anything wrong with for-
eign interference if it works to his ad-
vantage.
We cannot let this moment pass
without speaking up for the integrity
of our democracy and our values. Con-
gress, as a body, and we, as a country,
must speak out and say this is not ac-
ceptable. It is not acceptable for our
candidates for political office to seek
to engage with our adversaries or for-
eign authoritarian regimes to advance
their political campaigns. It is not ac-
ceptable to meet with foreign agents
about getting stolen information on
your opponents, information acquired
by foreign espionage. This is a viola-
tion of the public trust that is inherent
in any political office and which any
candidate for public office must uphold
to be worthy of the American people’s
support. I urge my colleagues to speak
out in condemning this conduct for the
sake of our democracy and to preserve
the American people’s faith in the in-
tegrity of our electoral system.

Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, due to my
concerns related to violations of the
Fourth Amendment, I will object to
any unanimous consent request, mo-
tion, or waiver of any rule in relation
to Treaty Doc. 111–8.
I cannot support action that provides
for the bulk collection of the financial

the treaty agreement should not come
at the grave expense of endangering
regular foreign investment and vio-

right of every American to be free from
unreasonable suspicionless searches.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4675
June 28, 2019
Previous tax treaties were more fo-
cused on information specific to sus-
picions of fraud and required serious al-
legations of tax wrongdoing to be sup-
ported by evidence. The new bulk col-
lection provisions, however, demand
Americans’ records under a vague
standard that allows the government
to access personal financial informa-
tion that may be ‘‘relevant’’ through
information exchanges between the
U.S. and foreign governments. This
new, lower, and ambiguous threshold
would allow government access to bank
records for hardly any reason at all. I
do not condone tax cheats, but I cannot
support an effort that punishes every
American in pursuit of those that have
actually broken the law.
Accordingly, I will object to any
unanimous consent request, motion, or
waiver or any rule in relation to Trea-
ty Doc. 111–8.

REMEMBERING BRUCE EDWARD
MCNABB
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I
wish to honor the life of Bruce Edward
McNabb, a lifelong Montanan and deco-
rated veteran of Vietnam.
While Bruce is no longer with us, his
legacy lives on. On behalf of myself,
my fellow Montanans, and my fellow
Americans, I would like extend our
deepest gratitude for his service to this
Nation.
Bruce was born on August 23, 1947, in
Butte, MT, to Dallas and Catherine
McNabb. His father was a World War II
veteran who fought with General
George Patton in the Mediterranean
theatre. His mother worked for the Na-
tional Forest Service. In addition to
their son, the couple had a daughter,
Bruce’s younger sister, Kathi.
After graduating from Butte Central
High School in 1965, Bruce moved to
Seattle, WA, where he worked for Boe-
ing. However, his plans quickly
changed at the age of 19 when he re-
ceived a draft letter from the U.S.
Army. He started basic training short-
ly thereafter.
Bruce served our country in Vietnam
from 1967 to 1968. In March of 1968, dur-
ing a search and clear mission, his unit
became heavily engaged with the
enemy. In an act of great bravery,
Bruce rushed to the aid of his fallen
platoon leader, helping him back to
safety. Without a moment’s pause, he
immediately rushed back out and
pulled an additional comrade out of
harm’s way, saving both men’s lives.
Upon his return home to Montana,
Bruce attended Carroll College in Hel-
ena. It was during this time he met the
love of his life, Linda Skiles, whom he
married on June 30, 1973. Together,
they raised two wonderful children,
their daughter, Kimberly, a certified
patient care technician in Billings,
MT, and their son, Rick, a teacher in
Beaverton, OR.
Like many Vietnam veterans who re-
turned home from service, Bruce fell
victim to the sinister effects of Agent
Orange, but he never let it slow him
down.
Known by many for his hard work
and determination, Bruce led a long ca-
reer as a store/plans coordinator for
Buttrey Food Stores, Super Yalu, and
Associated Food Stores. After many
years, he started a new career at
ExxonMobil, retiring in 2015.
Bruce and his wife Linda were mar-
ried for almost 46 years before he
passed away in November 2018. He was
a devoted family man and caring
grandfather to his two granddaughters,
Mariah and Ashlee.
He was passionate about a number of
sports teams, including the Green Bay
Packers, Notre Dame, Portland Trail
Blazers, the Cubbies, and took great
care of his truck ‘‘Sweetness.’’
I now have the profound honor of pre-
senting Bruce with his own set of mili-
tary honors. For his bravery in the line
of duty, Bruce Edward McNabb re-
ceived the: Bronze Star Medal with
bronze oakleaf cluster, Purple Heart
Medal, Air Medal, Good Conduct Medal,
National Defense Service Medal, Viet-
nam Service Medal with two Bronze
Service Stars, Republic of Vietnam
Campaign Ribbon with 1960 Device, Ex-
pert Badge with Machine Gun Bar, and
Marksman Badge with Rifle Bar.

sacrifice.
He is an American hero who has
made Montana proud, and we are eter-
nally grateful for his service.

HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 307
Whereas, deepening of the Mississippi
River Ship Channel to fifty feet is a historic
infrastructure project that is vital to our na-

deepening the Mississippi River Ship Chan-
nel to fifty feet; and

nomic benefits by the enhanced water car-
rying capacity of the Mississippi River Ship
Channel, also known as the gateway to
America’s Heartland; and
Whereas, the Mississippi River Ship Chan-
nel and tributaries currently account for
seven hundred fifty billion dollars of the na-
tion’s economy and two million four hundred
thousand jobs; and
Whereas, each new additional foot of water
draft will account for an additional one mil-
lion dollars in cargo on a vessel; Now, there-
fore, be it
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana
memorializes the Congress of the United
States to provide adequate funding to the
United States Army Corps of Engineers for
the completion of the proposed project to
deepen the Mississippi River Ship Channel to

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mr. REED (for himself and
Mr. ISAKSON):
S. 2049. A bill to amend the Higher
Education Act of 1965 to automatically
discharge the loans of certain veteran
borrowers, and for other purposes; to
the Committee on Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions.
Mr. REED. Mr. President, veterans
who have become disabled during their
service to our Nation should have their
student loans forgiven without delay,
without cumbersome red tape. Unfortu-
nately, that is not the case today,
which is why I am introducing legisla-
tion with my colleague from Georgia,
Senator ISAKSON, to require the De-
partment of Education to automati-
cally discharge student loans for vet-
erans who are totally and permanently
disabled.
In the fall of 2018, the Department of
Education and the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs announced a data-match-
ing program under which the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs would dis-
close data to the Department of Edu-
cation concerning veterans who are de-
termined to be 100 percent disabled or
individually unemployable. The De-
partment of Education would then
alert eligible veterans with Federal
student loans of the opportunity to
apply for debt relief.
This initiative was an important step
forward in improving the process for
disabled veterans, but it did not go far
enough. Too many eligible veterans are
still saddled with student loans that
they cannot repay. This spring, in re-
sponse to hearing questions, the De-
partment of Education reported that of
the over 40,000 veterans who were iden-
tified as eligible for loan forgiveness
through the matching program, fewer
than half submitted the required paper-
work and, as a result, have not had
their loans forgiven. Many of these in-
dividuals are currently in default on
their loans, which has dire financial re-
percussions for them and their fami-
lies.
We can and must do better. As many
Members of Congress have urged, along
with veterans’ service organizations,
and 51 bipartisan State attorneys gen-
eral, we should automatically dis-
charge the loans for eligible veteran
student loan borrowers identified
through the matching program. Pre-
viously, concern about potential tax li-
ability was identified as a reason for
not moving forward on automatic dis-
charge of these loans. However, the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 removed
the Federal tax liability, and we should
now move forward without delay to
automatically forgive these loans.
Our legislation requires the Depart-
ments of Education and Veterans Af-
fairs to conduct a computer matching
at least twice per year of individuals
with student loans who have received a
rating of total disability or who have
been determined to be unemployable.
It also requires the Departments to
work together to address minor dis-
crepancies in the data to ensure that
no veteran falls through the cracks due
to a clerical error. Finally, it requires
the Department of Education to auto-
matically discharge student loans for
individuals identified as eligible
through the matching program, unless
the borrower opts out because the De-
partment has identified a potential
State tax liability.
We are proud to have the support of
many veterans’ organizations for this
legislation, including High Ground Ad-
vocacy, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans
of America, Student Veterans of Amer-
ica, The Retired Enlisted Association,
Veterans Education Success, and U.S.
Army Warrant Officers Association. I
urge all my colleagues to join us in co-
sponsoring this legislation and pushing
for its swift passage. Veterans who
have served our nation and are now un-
able to work because of a service-con-
nected disability should not have to
worry about student loan payments.

FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GEN-
ERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIA-
TIONS ACT, 2020
SPEECH OF
HON. JOHN LEWIS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 25, 2019
The House in Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union had under
consideration the bill (H.R. 3351) making ap-
propriations for financial services and gen-
eral government for the fiscal year ending
September 30, 2020, and for other purposes:
Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 3351, the fiscal year 2020 Finan-
cial Services and General Government Appro-
priations Act.
Let me begin by thanking Chairman
QUIGLEY and Chairwoman LOWEY for their
leadership on this important bill. I would also
like to recognize their staff for reaching out
and listening our concerns and priorities in this
bill.
The Federal Government shutdown,
changes to the tax code, and difficulty access-
ing experts increases IRS casework in many
District Offices, including my own. As the chair
of the Ways and Means Oversight Sub-
committee, I believe it is critically important
that Congress restore desperately needed
funding for the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS).
For many years, the National Taxpayer Ad-
vocate underscored the necessity of providing
the agency with the resources, staff, and tools
it needs in order to improve taxpayer services.
Although Congress needs to restore the agen-
cy’s funding to at least $12.3 billion, I believe
that this bill finally moves the agency in the
right direction.
I would also like to reiterate my appreciation
for the Appropriations Committee’s support
when the House considered the Taxpayer
First Act. As you know the Taxpayer First Act,
which the House and Senate adopted earlier
this year, is the most important improvement
to taxpayer services in a generation. We
worked hard to correct misinformation that our
bill would tie the hands of the IRS and hurt
taxpayers’ options. During a time when there
is so much tension and rush to judgment, our
coalition remained thoughtful and fair.
As you know, Mr. Chair, the Taxpayer First
Act resulted from years of bipartisan hearings,
roundtables, and a public comment period on
the draft bill. This legislation authorizes $30
million dollars in matching grants for the pop-
ular Volunteer Income Tax Assistance pro-
gram, which helps low and moderate-income
taxpayers complete and file their taxes. The
Taxpayer First Act also protects certain low-in-
come taxpayers from the private debt collec-
tion program, and authorizes desperately
needed new initiatives to protect and serve
taxpayers, who are victims of identity theft. I
hope that this bipartisan, bicameral bill will be-
come public law in the near future.
In closing, I would also like to recognize the
Chairman’s hard work to remove problematic
policy riders from the FY20 House bill. I know
that it was not easy, and I thank him and his
staff for taking the time to consider our con-
cerns. I offer my strong support and commit-
ment to continue working with the Chairman
and the Subcommittee so that this critical
agency receives the funding and guidance so
that the IRS may provide the highest quality,
timely and secure taxpayer experience.

RECOGNIZING THE 10TH WORLD
TAMIL CONFERENCE
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 28, 2019
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker,
today I rise to recognize the International As-
sociation of Tamil Research, the Federation of
Tamil Sangams of North America, and the
Chicago Tamil Sangam on the occasion of the
10th World Tamil Conference, commencing on
July 4, 2019 in Schaumburg, Illinois.
Since the first World Tamil Conference in
1966, various cities around the world have
hosted this important gathering of scholars
and the Tamil community. The oldest sangam
in the United States, Chicago Tamil Sangam
is honored to observe its Golden Jubilee 50th
Anniversary in concert with the four-day World
Tamil Conference, its important scholarly pres-
entations on Tamil language and history, and
its celebration of the rich heritage of Tamil cul-
ture and art.
This year’s research conference theme is
‘‘New Historicist, Scientific and Comparative
Study of the Antiquity of the Tamils, Tamil
Language, Literature, Culture and Civilization.’’
In addition to this scholarly focus, the World
Tamil Conference will feature a host of cultural
programs, the International Conference Sem-
inar on Tamil Studies, a Global Tamil Entre-
preneurs meeting, and a festive parade and
banquet. Above all, the conference is a cele-
bration of the vibrant Tamil community and
preserves and shares the rich history and cul-
ture of Tamil people worldwide.
The 2019 World Tamil Conference also will
recognize the passing of the late Dr. V.C.
Kulandaisamy, former Vice Chancellor of Anna
University and Vice Chairman of the Inter-
national Association of Tamil Research. In ad-
dition to his outstanding contributions to the
science of hydrology, Dr. Kulandaisamy was
instrumental in bringing the International Asso-
ciation of Tamil Research conference to the
United States, and was honored for his con-
tributions to science, engineering and edu-
cation by the nation of India with the pres-
tigious national Padma Shri and Padma
Bhushan awards.
Madam Speaker, I would like to recognize
the World Tamil Conference and the Chicago
Tamil Sangam, International Association of
Tamil Research, and Federation of Tamil
Sangams of North America for their tireless ef-
forts to bring together proud Tamils from
around the world, for their commitment to pre-
serving one of the world’s oldest languages
and civilizations, and for their many years of
service to the Tamil diaspora in the United
States.

HON. STEVE COHEN

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 28, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise to con-
gratulate and celebrate the accomplishments
of the Vanderbilt Baseball Team and their Col-
lege World Series Championship victory. Van-
derbilt University won the College World Se-
ries on Wednesday, June 26, 2019 for the
second time in school history. I also want to
commend head coach Tim Corbin for leading
the team to a record-setting 59 victories this
season. They showed tremendous persever-
ance through the season, but most especially
when they came back once again in Game 3
to beat Michigan 8–2 and clinch the Cham-
pionship. The team’s season was also saved
by a remarkable pitching effort, led by Kumar
Rocker, who pitched a no-hitter against Duke
during the Super Regional. The Commodores
represented Vanderbilt University and the
state of Tennessee with distinction and did so
while remembering their fallen teammate,
Donny Everett. As the Vanderbilt fight song
states: ‘‘if vict’ry’s won, when battle’s done,
Then Vandy’s name will rise in fame; Dyna-
mite; Dynamite.’’ I’d like to once again con-
gratulate the 2019 Vanderbilt Baseball team
for their College World Series Championship
and dynamite season.

RECOGNIZING RONA FALLS’ CON-
TRIBUTIONS TO MUNDY MILL
LEARNING ACADEMY
HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 28, 2019
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize Mrs. Rona Falls for
her contributions to Mundy Mill Learning Acad-
emy.
Earlier this month, Falls was one of six par-
ents statewide who were honored by the
Georgia Department of Education and the
Georgia Parent Teacher Association for their
outstanding leadership in creating a foundation
of support for student achievement and suc-
cess. Falls was nominated by Mundy Mill’s
principal, Crystal Brown, for her steadfast
commitment to Mundy Mill Learning Academy.
Her time spent volunteering and working at
her daughter’s school is particularly commend-
able considering she moved to Gainesville
from the Philippines only two years ago. After
Rona, her daughter Lizzy, and her husband
Eric, a Gainesville native, moved to Gaines-
ville, she began volunteering at Mundy Mill in
hopes of getting involved in the community.
Two years later, Falls has served on Mundy
Mill’s School Governance Council, on the
Gainesville City School System’s Technology
Committee, as a Girl Scout troop leader, and
as vice president of the Parent Teacher Asso-
ciation (PTA). This coming year, Falls will
serve as PTA president.
Parents should make every effort they can
to be involved in their child’s education. Falls
has gone above and beyond by not only being
active in her daughter’s educational experi-
ence, but by working to enhance the learning
experience of every child at Mundy Mill Learn-
ing Academy.
On behalf of the people of Gainesville and
the educators and parents at Mundy Mill
Learning Academy, I would like to thank Mrs.
Falls for her commitment to our students and
congratulate her on being honored with the
Georgia Parent Leadership Award.

HONORING SETH D. APPLETON
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 28, 2019
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I
rise today on behalf of Senator ROY BLUNT,
Congressman SAM GRAVES, Congressman
BILLY LONG, Congressman JASON SMITH, Con-
gresswoman ANN WAGNER, Congresswoman
VICKY HARTZLER, and Congressman WILLIAM
LACY CLAY to congratulate Seth Daniel Apple-
ton on his confirmation to the position of As-
sistant Secretary for Policy Development and
Research at the Department of Housing and
Urban Development.
While working for two Members of our dele-
gation, myself and Representative SAM
GRAVES, Seth showed an exceptional ability of
working across the aisle to achieve bipartisan
policy solutions. As a legislative staffer he
managed numerous policy areas including
housing, banking, defense and agriculture. He
excelled in his duties, eventually rising to the
position of Chief of Staff in my office.
It was in this role that Seth truly showed his
ability to excel in housing policy. Working for
the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Hous-
ing and Insurance and with fellow Missouri
Congressman EMANUEL CLEAVER as the Rank-
ing Member, they coauthored the Housing Op-
portunity Through Modernization Act, which
unanimously passed the House and Senate
and was signed into law in 2016. Seth was a
key part of the passage of this bill, advising
me every step of the way.
Madam Speaker, we are pleased that the
U.S. Senate has confirmed Seth to be Assist-
ant Secretary for Policy Development and Re-
search. Housing issues are not only of vital
importance to our home state of Missouri, but
to the Nation as a whole, and we have no
doubt that Seth will find great success in this
distinguished role.

RECOGNIZING THE LEGACY OF
JAMES BOGGS
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 28, 2019
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, it is with great
pride and respect that I recognize the legacy
of James Boggs, a worker and activist, who
played a pivotal role in labor organizing and
the civil rights movement in the city of Detroit.
James Boggs was born in Alabama in 1919.
He eventually moved to Detroit, where he be-
came an auto worker. Active in his workers
union, Mr. Boggs was passionate about the
political issues facing workers and African
Americans. His experiences and increasing in-
terest in far-left philosophies inspired him to
pen The American Revolution: Pages from a
Negro Worker’s Notebook, his most well-
known work.
Mr. Boggs married Grace Lee in 1953. Their
influence as a couple and individually had a
tremendous impact on the organizing commu-
nity, drawing influence from global history and
observations of the everyday struggles of peo-
ple. Together the Boggs’s grassroots efforts to
uplift voices of community members resulted
in their founding of a summer leadership pro-
gram. That legacy and program lives on in the
James and Grace Lee Boggs School in De-
troit.
I am proud to acknowledge and uplift Mr.
Boggs’s many achievements as we celebrate
the one hundredth anniversary of his birthday.
