In the name of the Father and of the

RECOGNIZING IOWA SAFE
SCHOOLS’ SECOND ANNUAL
PRIDE CAMP
HON. ABBY FINKENAUER
OF IOWA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Ms. FINKENAUER. Madam Speaker, I am
honored to join in celebrating the second an-
nual Pride Camp at Iowa Safe Schools and to
congratulate everyone involved in making this
incredible resource for LGBTQ youth in our
state a reality. This week-long program is de-
signed for LGBTQ youth to have an oppor-
tunity to learn, grow, and simply have fun in a
safe and supportive environment.
I was a page in Iowa’s State House when
the ‘‘Iowa Safe Schools Law’’—the Anti-Bul-
lying and Anti-Harassment Act of 2007—was
passed. It was the result of years of tireless
work from advocates and legislators, including
many of the Iowans who have dedicated
themselves to Pride Camp. I am honored to
be a voice for LGBTQ Iowans of all ages in
Congress.
I applaud Iowa Safe Schools for the inspir-
ing work that it does in our communities, year-
round, to create a nurturing environment for
LGBTQ youth, by providing critical resources
and training for students, educators, parents,
and young allies.

COMMEMORATION OF THE 40TH
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY OF DO-
LORES AND WILL GRESHAM
HON. MARK E. GREEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to recognize and honor Dolores and
Will Gresham of Somerville, Tennessee on the
very special occasion of their 40th wedding
anniversary.
Dolores and Will were married on August 2,
1969. Together, their lives have been marked
by service to their community, with both retir-
ing from the United States Marine Corps with
the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. During her
military service, Dolores completed USMC
Amphibious Warfare School, USMC Command
and Staff College, and an MS in Industrial
Management at George Washington University
before she and Will returned to a cattle farm
in West Tennessee where they currently live.
Dolores has served in the Tennessee State
Senate since 2008.
In addition to their service, their marriage of
forty faithful years embodies the values of
Tennessee which have and will keep our state
and our nation strong. There is no doubt that
they have lived an All-American life with their
family—raising Hereford cattle on their farm,
investing in their neighbors, and holding fast to
their strong values and shared faith, giving us
all an ideal to which we can aspire. May their
commitment grow even stronger as they love,
cherish, and honor one another for many
years to come.
Madam Speaker, I commend this great cou-
ple on their 40th year of marriage. I ask that
my colleagues in the United States House of
Representatives join me in congratulating
them on this momentous occasion.

PERYL KELLEY SCHAAF
HON. SCOTT R. TIPTON
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize a pioneer and a standout citizen
of Durango, Colorado, Peryl Schaaf. Peryl
began her life as a homesteader in southwest
Colorado and eventually served as one of the
highest officer positions at the Bank of Du-
rango.
Peryl is the daughter of two homesteading
families in Durango, CO. She eloped and mar-
ried her husband, Ernie Schaaf, at the age of
fifteen, on August 20, 1939. The couple had
four children, nine grandchildren, and five
great-grandchildren. Her family was full of
strong hardworking women including her Aunt,
Olga Little, a local mining legend and a trail-
blazer.
Peryl was no stranger to hard work herself.
She started working at the young age of six.
She was the family homemaker while her
mother taught at remote one room school
houses. She worked as a gas pump attendant
at her father’s station during World War II, and
years later, started a job at the Bank of Du-
rango as a teller. Despite being paid only half
of what her male counterparts made, her hard
work did not go unnoticed by her colleagues
or management and she eventually rose
through the ranks to serve as the Vice Presi-
dent of the bank.
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to honor
Peryl. As a renowned storyteller in her com-
munity, Peryl will continue to highlight her re-
markable life through the Durango Native Sto-
ries—a reoccurring public series offering first-
hand recollections of personal stories from Du-
rango locals. Her life of hard work, persever-
ance and achievement is worthy of com-
mendation and I am proud to honor her leg-
acy.

RECOGNIZING BRUCE FLAHERTY
HON. GRACE MENG
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize and hold up for distinction the tire-
less work of Mr. Bruce Flaherty, a Vietnam
veteran and my constituent from Flushing,
Queens.
Since 2004, Mr. Flaherty has dedicated him-
self to see that a flag is flown over the Capitol
for each of the men in his infantry who were
killed in Vietnam. At the completion of this
mission this year, he flew a total of 289 Amer-
ican flags to honor the service and sacrifice of
his fellow servicemen. Mr. Flaherty located
and identified 103 families of those killed in
the Vietnam War and has presented each of
them with our nation’s flag and official certifi-
cate. His commitment over the decades is
heartfelt, exemplary, and admirable.
Born and raised in Queens, Mr. Flaherty
served in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969 in the
4th Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment (Old
Guard). He was honorably discharged from
the Army and received the Purple Heart
Award.
After returning to the United States, Mr.
Flaherty worked at the New York Telephone
Company for 32 years. He worked on vet-
erans issues with the Americal Division Vet-
erans Association, helping veterans and their
families locate information in the National Ar-
chive to assist in their claims for awards and
benefits. Mr. Flaherty also volunteered on a
variety of task forces, including Hurricane Glo-
ria in 1985 and Ground Zero in 2001.
Mr. Flaherty has dedicated countless hours
to help us remember those who lost their lives
when fighting for our country. His work has
also reassured families that the sacrifices their
loved ones made for our country are remem-
bered and that their memories live on.
I extend my sincere gratitude to Mr. Flaherty
for all he has done, and continues to do, to
honor those who valiantly fought and died for
our freedom. His work is greatly appreciated,
and I am honored to have him as my con-
stituent.
Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues in
the House of Representatives to join me in
celebrating the selfless work and remarkable
achievements of Mr. Bruce Flaherty. His dedi-
cation to honoring his fellow soldiers is truly
commendable.

HONORING BILL SOMERVILLE
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the work of Bill Somerville, an ex-
traordinary philanthropist, grant-maker, advi-
sor, and a generous, creative, and devoted
advocate for those in need.
Bill Somerville grew up in Berkeley, Cali-
fornia, and later attended the University of
California. He served for 17 years as Execu-
tive Director of the pioneering and highly re-
garded Peninsula Community Foundation and
is a nationally recognized expert on creative
grant-making, having advised more than 400
community foundations in the United States,
Canada, and abroad on effective operations
and grantmaking. He has taught courses on

philanthropy at Stanford University, UC Berke-
ley’s Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, and
Laney Community College, in Oakland, Cali-
fornia. Bill was honored with the 2004
Gerbode Fellowship Award in recognition of
outstanding achievement as a nonprofit execu-
tive and is a founding member of the National
Advisory Board of the Haas Center for Public
Service at Stanford University. He has also
been an advisor to the Dean of the UC Berke-
ley School of Social Welfare and serves as an
advisor to the Peery Family Foundation and
the Junior League of Palo Alto.
Bill is the author, with Fred Setterberg, of
Grassroots Philanthropy: Field Notes of a
Maverick Grantmaker, a guide to creative
grantmaking. In it, according to the Financial
Times, May 2008, ‘‘Somerville describes in en-
gaging prose how to be an effective philan-
thropist. With no agenda other than his need
to set things right in the world, he lays out a
series of principles that can be adopted by
both endowed national foundations and those
with lesser means, providing they have an
urge to use their wealth to improve the world.’’
Bill Somerville’s career as a maverick grant-
maker spans 50 years in nonprofit work. In
1990, he founded Philanthropic Ventures
Foundation (PVF) which specializes in creative
giving programs customized to donors’ inter-
ests. Under his stewardship, PVF has distin-
guished itself as a leader in ‘‘venture philan-
thropy,’’ a term coined by Somerville to de-
scribe PVF’s quick-response, high-impact
grant mode, including immediate response
grants and paperless giving.
Larry Purcell, the highly respected founder
of the Catholic Worker House in Redwood
City, California, reports that more than 40
years ago he and Bill Somerville became
teamsters for the poor by picking up free fresh
produce from the South San Francisco
Produce Terminal. The Catholic Worker House
has continued to distribute thousands of
pounds of produce each week, using three
15,000-pound trucks acquired through Bill
Somerville’s generosity and that of Philan-
thropic Ventures. A decade ago, Bill Somer-
ville and Philanthropic Ventures Foundation
gave the Catholic Worker House seed money
to purchase a two-bedroom house in Red-
wood City for day laborers. In 2018 Bill Som-
erville and Philanthropic Ventures Foundation
provided seed money for Catholic Workers to
buy a home in Oakland to house men coming
out of San Quentin State Prison. Meanwhile,
Catholic Workers in Redwood City, San
Bruno, San Jose, and Santa Maria, California,
have been feeding, clothing, sheltering, and
educating the very poor by the thousands. Bill
Somerville and Philanthropic Ventures Foun-
dation have supported each of those Catholic
Worker Houses in magnificent ways. Accord-
ing to Purcell, Bill Somerville is great, humble,
dedicated, and serves the poor with deep,
deep kindness.
In Grassroots Philanthropy Bill said ‘‘Philan-
thropy is a fascinating pursuit. It’s the stuff of
dreams made practical, a lever that can move
the world. Philanthropy is a subject about
which I remain unequivocally and
unapologetically passionate.’’
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of
Representatives to join me in honoring the ex-
traordinary work of an extraordinary man, Bill
Somerville, and thanking him for his unique
leadership. He has strengthened our commu-
nities and bettered our nation through his vi-
sion, passion, and integrity, and he stands as
a role model of what a citizen can do to create
transformative change in the lives of so many.

RECOGNIZING THE 20TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF WOMEN & HI TECH
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker,
I rise today in recognition of the 20th anniver-
sary of the Indiana based nonprofit, Women &
Hi Tech. Founded in 1999, the organization
seeks to promote the participation of women
in science and technology fields, and to en-
sure that opportunities in STEM jobs are
equally inclusive for all. The organization has
demonstrated consistent leadership in our
community and helped open doors for many
women. The people of the Fifth Congressional
District are grateful for Women & Hi Tech, and
it is my pleasure to congratulate the organiza-
tion in celebration of this special occasion.
In 1999, two women leaders in our commu-
nity, Joyce Gustafson, a scientist working for
Eli Lilly, and Georgia Miller, an academic at
Indiana University, discovered that there were
few women like themselves working in high
tech jobs in Indiana. Together, they sought to
create an organization that would fill the gaps
they saw in women leaders in the Indianapolis
area. Their initial launch saw much support
from the community, including many profes-
sionals in a wide variety of industries. The first
Board of Directors of Women & Hi Tech in-
cluded Jennifer Sander, Donna Gastevich,
Jamie Eicher, Lisa Robertson, Jennifer
Scheerer, Sue Ream, Suzanne Nutter, Cindy
Royer, and Julie Nahvi. Other significant con-
tributions to Women & Hi Tech in its infancy
were provided by Susan E. Ziel, Esq., a fe-
male attorney who drafted and filed the orga-
nization’s incorporation documents, and other
women and men who have served on the or-
ganization’s all-volunteer Board of Directors
over the years.
With a mission to make careers in STEM
equally inclusive to all, Women & Hi Tech has
grown its membership to nearly 2,000 profes-
sionals and students. Their focus is broad.
Some programs support girls as young as kin-
dergarten, while others support women in aca-
demic careers and on to their professional
lives. Programs like Passport to Hi-Tech and
Ignite Your Superpower (IYS) teach young
girls about the wide variety of opportunities
available to them in science and technology
fields, while simultaneously connecting them
with leaders already working in those fields.
Other programs including OperationAll, Execu-
tive Women’s Forums and the Leading Light
Awards focus on working professionals, edu-
cating and empowering them to achieve high-
er in their careers. They also hold seasonal
networking events, which are held at notable
locations around Indiana like the Indianapolis
Motor Speedway and serve to reinforce their
already robust series of education and em-
powerment programs.
Women & Hi Tech continues to invest into
the future of our community through their ef-
forts to build lasting partnerships with local
businesses. These partnerships give the orga-
nization a unique ability to support women in
a wide variety of industries, and for a wide va-
riety of purposes. For example, as part of their
#WHT20for20 campaign, Women & Hi Tech
will be donating over $30,000 in scholarships
and grants to Indiana women and girls pur-
suing STEM. Directed primarily at women pur-
suing academic goals, these funds open doors
and provide opportunities that are of immense
value. It is programs like this that allow the or-
ganization to attract a large number of profes-
sionals and students, from across many sec-
tors of our economy, to its ranks.
Women & Hi Tech has done, and continues
to do, great things for the people of Indiana.
Under the leadership of President Angela
Freeman, I am confident that the organization
will continue growing and succeeding. Many of
the most influential leaders in our community
give their time to help this organization suc-
ceed, and it is my great pleasure to congratu-
late Women & Hi Tech on 20 years of service.
I commend them on their continuing mission
of empowerment of women leaders in our
community, and I wish them all the best in

RECOGNIZING THE NORTHEAST
WISCONSIN COUNTY VETERAN
SERVICE OFFICERS
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the hard work, dedication,
and outstanding service our County Veteran
Service Officers provide in assisting veterans
in Northeast Wisconsin.
County Veteran Service Officers are self-ap-
pointed, concerned veterans who take it upon
themselves to aid and assist fellow veterans
and survivors with benefits and resources. The
first CVSO in Wisconsin was appointed in
1932. In 1935, the Wisconsin CVSO Associa-
tion was established, and in 1946, Wisconsin
passed legislation requiring each county to
hire a CVSO who served in the Armed Forces.
For nearly 90 years, Wisconsin CVSOs
have led the way in connecting veterans and
their families with benefit programs. CVSOs
work hard to provide caring counseling, assist-
ance, and advocacy for veterans in need.
I am incredibly proud of the work our
CVSOs from Brown, Calumet, Door,
Kewaunee, Marinette, Oconto, Outagamie,
Shawano, Waupaca, and Winnebago counties,
and our Tribal Veteran Service Officers from
the Oneida Nation, Menominee Indian Tribe of
Wisconsin, Stockbridge-Munsee Community
Band of Mohican Indians and Ho-Chunk Na-
tion provide for Northeast Wisconsin. These
officers and their staff are key to the success
of veterans who look for assistance as they
transition to civilian life.
I am proud to have such quality County Vet-
eran Service Officers and Tribal Veteran Serv-
ice Officers in my district. The task of being a
CVSO is not always easy. These officers are
veterans who served our nation, returned
home, and continue their service in our com-
munities. These men and women truly dem-
onstrate what it means to engage in selfless
service.

Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this

HONORING JERRY ZREMSKI, BUF-
FALO NEWS WASHINGTON BU-
REAU CHIEF, UPON RECEIVING
THE 2018 REGIONAL REPORTING
AWARD
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Jerry Zremski, The Buffalo News’
Washington Bureau Chief, for winning the Na-
tional Press Club’s Washington Regional Re-
porting Award for 2018.
Zremski was recognized for this award due
to his hard work and diligence in the reporting
field. He has produced thorough, well-written
work that gives the people of Buffalo and be-
yond the information they need from a trusted
voice they know and love. He has reported on
breaking news regarding federal issues, sev-
eral presidential elections and political conven-
tions. Zremski was embedded as a cor-
respondent during the Iraq War, has reported
on events in France, and also spent time in
Asia as part of his ‘‘From Burma to Buffalo’’
series.
Zremski has been with The Buffalo News,
starting out as a business reporter, since
1984. In 1989, he began his work in Wash-
ington on behalf of the beloved Buffalo paper,
and has served as the Washington Bureau
Chief since 2007. Previously, Zremski was a
National Press Club president and the Nieman
fellow at Harvard University. He is not a
stranger to awards such as this, as he won
the 2016 Professional Journalists award and
last year received the Washington Press Club
Foundation’s David Lynch Memorial Reporting
Award.
Reporters are often present in places the
general public cannot be, due either to restric-
tions or because they simply are not able to
be. Jerry Zremski has done a wonderful job
conveying the facts and figures of any given
story to allow his readers a glimpse into what
has happened. We salute and honor your
work here today, Mr. Zremski. We know we
can plan to see even more great things from
you in the future.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
honor Jerry Zremski for receiving this award
and his body of work.

RECOGNIZING MT. JOY MIS-
SIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH IN
EDWARDSVILLE
HON. RODNEY DAVIS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mt. Joy Mis-
sionary Baptist Church in Edwardsville, which
is celebrating 150 years as a church con-
gregation this year.
Mt. Joy was founded in Edwardsville in
1869 by ex-slaves who conducted church
services in their homes. Early members and
founders dedicated their efforts and time into
selling barbeque and wild game dinners to
fund the construction of a log cabin in 1871 to
hold church services for their community. After
overcoming many obstacles over the years, in-
cluding a fire that destroyed the original cabin
in 1909, the church still stands strong on its
mission to spread God’s word in the Metro
East.
There have been countless leaders in the
church’s 150-year history, but I want to con-
gratulate Pastor Steve Jackson and Chairman
Donnie Howard for leading this church at this
historic time. Mt. Joy Missionary Baptist
Church is an important piece of Edwardsville’s
history, and I’m proud to honor the church and
its legacy.

TRIBUTE TO VICE ADMIRAL C.
FORREST FAISON, III, UNITED
STATES NAVY
HON. MARCY KAPTUR
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the service and achievements of
an esteemed and valued member of our
Armed Forces, Vice Admiral C. Forrest
Faison, III, United States Navy, on his retire-
ment after 39 years of honorable and dedi-
cated service to our country. His unwavering
commitment to those entrusted in his care will
remain his legacy long after his departure.
For the past two years, I had the opportunity
to work directly with Vice Admiral Faison in his
position as the Navy Surgeon General.
Throughout his tenure, he provided invaluable
support to Congress, particularly its Members
and committee staff as he presented the mis-
sion, vision, and execution of Navy Medicine
for our country’ s sailors, marines, and their
families. As a fellow Northern Ohioan, I would
like to share with you some highlights of his
distinguished career.
For 39 years, Vice Admiral Faison excelled
in his leadership and the training of medical
professionals in America’s Navy at home, sea,
and abroad. He served as the Deputy Sur-
geon General of the Navy and Deputy Chief,
Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, from 2013 to
2015, and as our 38th Surgeon General of the
Navy.
As Commander of Navy Medicine West and
Naval Medical Center San Diego, he was re-
sponsible for medical care and support to over
850,000 eligible beneficiaries with a staff of
16,000 at 10 hospitals and over 30 clinics
from the West Coast to the Indian Ocean. He
served as Deputy Chief, Bureau of Medicine
and Surgery for Current and Future Health-
care Operations; Commanding Officer, Naval
Hospital Camp Pendleton; Commanding Offi-
cer, U.S. Expeditionary Medical Facility; and
U.S. Medical Task Force, Kuwait, where he
led a tri-service task force of subordinate com-
mands and was responsible for all healthcare
operations in Kuwait, Qatar, and Southern
Iraq, including all medical logistics support
throughout U.S. Central Command.
Additional assignments included Deputy
Commander, Naval Medical Center Ports-
mouth, Portsmouth, Virginia; Group Surgeon,
3d Force Service Support Group, Fleet Marine
Forces, Pacific; Director of Department of De-
fense Telemedicine, Washington, D.C.; Chief
Information Officer, Navy Medicine; Director,
Clinical Services, U.S. Naval Hospital
Yokosuka, Japan; Naval Hospital Lemoore;
USS Texas (CGN 39); and Amphibious Group
3.
As Vice Admiral Faison closes this chapter
of his life to embark on new adventures, I urge
my colleagues to join me in extending our
congratulations to him on his retirement. We
wish him, his wife Michelle, and family, ‘‘Fair
Winds and Following Seas.’’

RECOGNIZING PEORIA ILLINOIS
AMERICAN WATER ON THEIR
130TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to congratulate Illinois American Water from
Peoria, IL, for achieving the milestone of 130
years of continued water quality service to 1.3
million citizens in the State of Illinois.
Illinois American Water has represented ex-
emplary values since its founding in 1890.
With a dedicated and skilled work force, mem-
bers of Illinois American Water ensure the
safety of the Peoria area’s water supply. They
offer an abundance of water services and pro-
vide education to the public about our world’s
most precious resource. They are invested in
new technologies and renewable energy meth-
ods that continue to set the standard for their
industry. Their 130 years of integrity and envi-
ronmental stewardship displayed in the com-
munity is to be celebrated.
Madam Speaker, I would like to again for-
mally congratulate Illinois American Water on
130 years of service, and I join the rest of the
community in wishing them every success in
the future.

IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 2615, THE
UNITED STATES–NORTHERN TRI-
ANGLE ENHANCEMENT
ENGAGMENT ACT
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise
in strong support of H.R. 2615, the ‘‘United
States–Northern Triangle Enhancement En-
gagement Act.’’
H.R. 2615 supports the people of Central
America and strengthens United States na-
tional security by addressing the root causes
of migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and
Honduras.
H.R. 2615 will provide reports on drivers of
migration from the Northern Triangle to the
United States and will identify methods for the
United States to strengthen fragile democ-
racies in the region.
Thousands of immigrants flee the Northern
Triangle to seek asylum and refuge in the
United States of America.
The number of asylum seekers worldwide
originating from the Northern Triangle reached
110,000 in 2015, a five-fold increase from
2012.
Poverty, corrupt police forces, gang vio-
lence, political corruption, and economic insta-
bility exacerbate living conditions in the North-
ern Triangle.
Homicide rates are extremely high for Cen-
tral American countries; El Salvador is leading
the way with a rate of 82.84 per 100,000 per-
sons.
Salvadorans, Hondurans, and Guatemalans
leave their homes in search of physical secu-
rity, democracy, freedom, and civil liberties.
They look toward the U.S. as a beacon of
hope and prosperity, often traveling miles
while battling hardships and risks to pursue
the American Dream.
This bill seeks to combat corruption among
political institutions in the region to reinforce
security and lead to the development of civil
society.
We must address the origins and the struc-
tural causes of migration to address the issues
that lead to mass migration to our southern
borders.
Our agencies are unequipped and are in-
capable of meeting the demand of sheltering
and processing immigrants who arrive at our
ports of entry.
Our nation’s security depends on the sta-
bility of the Northern Triangle.
We must act to ensure that the countries in
this region return to a functioning democracy,
free of corruption and violence.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in supporting H.R. 2615 to assist in re-
establishing democratic and peaceful societies
in the countries of the Northern Triangle.

RECOGNIZING THE VETERANS’
MENTOR GROUP OF OUTAGAMIE
COUNTY, WISCONSIN
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the hard work, dedication,
and outstanding service of Veterans’ Mentor
Group in Outagamie County, Wisconsin.
Since its creation in 2015, Veterans’ Mentor
Group has assisted countless veterans in
Northeast Wisconsin navigate the struggles of
transitioning to civilian life. The group’s suc-
cess is evident as three graduates of the pro-
gram are now members of the group’s leader-
ship team. Along with founding members Bill
and Beverly, Thomas Barrett, Scott Hutchings,
Michael Gawel, and Rodney Schreiber work to
ensure Outagamie County Veterans feel sup-
ported and connected. I am confident its mem-
bers will continue to help many more veterans
as the program grows.
Veterans’ Mentor Group consists of volun-
teer veterans and partners within Outagamie
County who share and understand the experi-
ences of military service. The group assists
veterans with their basic needs, as well as en-
gaging in socialization and reintegration back
into their communities. I am proud to have a
veteran-run organization in my district that
strives to help fellow veterans. The volunteers
of Veterans’ Mentor Group truly demonstrate
what it means to engage in selfless service.
The Veterans’ Mentor Group also assists
the Veteran Treatment Court in Outagamie
County and increasing veterans’ awareness of
resources and benefit programs. Bill Trombley,
along with Beverly Weber, Todd Raley, and
Jason Laber, worked hard to ensure this sup-
port program for veterans in Outagamie Coun-
ty became a success. Their efforts and com-
mitment are integral in creating this successful
program.
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this
body to join me in applauding Veterans’ Men-
tor Group, its board, and its veteran volunteer
mentors for their service to veterans in North-
east Wisconsin.

THE EMERY COUNTY PUBLIC
LAND MANAGEMENT ACT IN-
CLUDED IN S. 47, THE JOHN D.
DINGELL, JR. CONSERVATION,
MANAGEMENT, AND RECREATION
ACT
HON. JOHN R. CURTIS
OF UTAH
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Mr. CURTIS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
regarding the Emery County Public Land Man-
agement Act, that was included in S. 47, the
John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Manage-
ment, and Recreation Act. This became Public
Law 116–9 on March 12th, 2019.
Throughout 2018 and early 2019, Senator
Hatch, Senator ROMNEY, and myself heavily
engaged with the Emery County Commis-
sioners and Emery County Public Lands
Council to draft this important piece of legisla-
tion. After Senator Hatch’s retirement, Senator
ROMNEY helped to carry the ball across the
finish line.
This law is the result of countless hours of
deliberation, and thus I find it important to
highlight some areas of congressional intent of
particular interest. While these should gen-
erally be clear in the text and corresponding
map, the historical context of how we arrived
at some of these decisions may be of benefit
to the Department of the Interior, future mem-
bers of the Utah delegation, or those in Utah.
The Utah delegation, and particularly myself,
look forward to the implementation of this new
law.
Of note, Jake Bornstein (my Legislative Di-
rector), Romel Nicholas (Senator Hatch’s pub-
lic lands staffer), and Kelsey Berg (Senator
ROMNEY’s Deputy Chief of Staff) were the
main staff points of contact in our respective
offices for the bill. Jake and Romel have ex-
tensive correspondence with the Bureau of
Land Management (BLM) that further dem-
onstrates the accurate characterization of the
congressional intent I outline here.
Most important to this process, our founding
principle was to never take any action that
would end a current ongoing use. For exam-
ple, we were immensely careful to not close a
road, trail, air strip, or other existing use in the
legislative text or corresponding map with a
wilderness designation. Further, we worked
extensively to avoid more restrictive designa-
tions, such as wilderness, to areas it would
limit ongoing activity. We worked to draw des-
ignation boundaries along geographic and
physical features, or just outside a cherry
stem, to ensure management made sense for
the area.
Any designation boundary that does not fol-
low these trends, particularly any designation
that puts at risk an existing use due to a poor-
ly drawn boundary, was a clerical error and
should be resolved under the authority clearly
provided in Sec. 1221. Given the pure scale of
this bill and legislative map, we realized this
authority would be a vital tool to resolve these
errors.
I’d also like to point out the clear intent with-
in Sec. 1232. Section (e), which clearly states
that non-wilderness activities or uses that can
be seen or heard from areas within wilderness
are to be left uninterrupted by this legislation.
On the topic of roads, we worked closely
with BLM to ensure all roads in the 2008 RMP
were not put into a wilderness designation,
often referred to as ‘‘cherry stemmed’’. Our in-
tent was to preserve these roads and for them
to stay open. These cherry stems are of var-
ious sizes and were intended to ensure an
adequate corridor is there to facilitate nec-
essary maintenance. In the Recreation Area,
we included language in Sec. 1222 to ensure
the necessary maintenance to existing routes
may continue and allow rerouting of roads or
trails to protect the resources of the Recre-
ation Area.
Finally, I would like to explain that the driv-
ing force for this compromise bill was cer-
tainty, and thus preventing the designation of
a national monument using the authority grant-
ed to the President under the Antiquities Act.
As so many know, national monument des-
ignations in my home state of Utah have been
the source of extensive controversy. In my
view, land management is most effective when
it is driven by local voices, compromise, and
well-reasoned planning. Sweeping designa-
tions via national monument are often politi-
cally-inspired and they erode the quality of
management for the areas they intend to pro-
tect. With the passage of the Emery County
legislation, the need for a national monument
is forfeited because a clear plan has been laid
out for the long-term management of the San
Rafael Swell. To be clear, this is a view that
was shared by the many parties, including lo-
cally elected officials, conservationists, and
recreationists, that were intimately involved in
the forging of this compromise legislation. Any

future national monument designation under
the Antiquities Act in Emery County would be
a violation of the good faith agreement that
was shared among those that negotiated as
part of this bill’s process.
I believe this bill is a big win for all stake-
holders, and I look forward to watching what
was a 20-year journey for Emery County come
to fruition.

HONORING CHARLES SMITH
HON. SAM GRAVES
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor my dear friend, Charles
Smith, and to congratulate him on the comple-
tion of his term as President of the Missouri-
National Education Association (MNEA) and
wish him well as he enters into retirement.
A graduate of Northwest Missouri State Uni-
versity, Charles taught communication arts in
the Center School District of Kansas City for
over three decades. Through being an active
member of his church and the head of the
Communication Arts Department and High
School Newspaper Advisor, Charles always
sought to find every opportunity to help his
students and serve his community.
It was this desire to serve that led Charles
to seek the position of MNEA President six
years ago. As President, Charles chaired the
MNEA Board of Directors, served as the asso-
ciation’s official spokesperson for the state of
Missouri and represented over 35,000 mem-
bers of the MNEA.
Madam Speaker, dedicated and hard-
working educators, such as Charles, put in an
immense amount of effort to ensure our chil-
dren receive the best education possible and
help students realize their dreams. One thing
is certain; I know that I could have never
served in the halls of Congress without the
help of devoted and caring teachers along the
way, and Charles has certainly made a lasting
impact on my career. I am grateful for his
friendship and comradery over the years and
wish him well in his future endeavors.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE DENTON
VA MENTAL HEALTH ANNEX
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the new Denton VA Mental
Health Annex. North Texas is fortunate to be
home to a number of veterans, and it is critical
that we have the resources to support these
brave men and women. This morning, we held
a ribbon cutting ceremony at The Annex, a
new clinic that will help ensure that our grow-
ing veteran population can access quality
mental health care close to home.
It was my privilege to work alongside the
Department of Veterans Affairs to assist in the
opening of this new facility. This project took
a team effort, and I am grateful to the many
people who helped to make The Annex a re-
ality.
In Congress, it is both my privilege and my
responsibility to support North Texas veterans.
Quality health care—including mental health
care—is imperative to our veterans’ wellbeing,
and this new clinic is an important resource for
our community.
Last week, I joined my fellow Members of
Congress from North Texas on a letter urging
the Veterans Administration to help facilitate
the donation of a hospital center in Garland,
Texas. Following our collaborative work in
Denton, I am hopeful that communities in Gar-
land and beyond can build on our success
and ensure that veterans in North Texas have
the health care they deserve.
It is imperative for Congress to support the
brave men and women who have answered
the call to serve our nation, including ensuring
that they can access quality health care. As
we mark the opening of The Annex, I hope
that it is a valuable resource to our North
Texas veterans.

HONORING THE CAREER OF KASEY
J. CRONQUIST
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, to mark
the conclusion of American Grown Flowers
Month, we honor a great citizen who has been
instrumental in starting the movement to sup-
port American Grown Flowers, Kasey J.
Cronquist, the outgoing CEO of the California
Cut Flower Commission and Administrator of
Certified American Grown.
In 2007, Kasey Cronquist took the helm of
the California Cut Flower Commission and in
his successful tenure, he spearheaded an ag-
gressive legislative advocacy program tar-
geting elected officials in Sacramento and
Washington, D.C., and retail promotional cam-
paigns to attract consumers and industry
stakeholders to the benefits of American
Grown Flowers.
His efforts have brought industry and con-
sumer attention to the value and importance of
domestically grown flowers and foliage, help-
ing consumers connect the ‘‘Farm to Fork’’
trend with floral, and driving home the mes-
sage that the bouquets at the center of our ta-
bles should be as fresh, sustainable, and
homegrown as the food on our plates.
Prior to joining CCFC, Cronquist held posts
as president and CEO of the Carpinteria Val-
ley Chamber of Commerce and CEO of the
Shelton-Mason County Chamber in Wash-
ington State. A firm believer in service to the
industry, Cronquist is an active volunteer for
the Buy California Marketing Agreement, the
Agriculture President’s Council of California,
and the California Department of Food and
Agriculture Nursery Advisory Board.
A committed nonprofit leader, Cronquist is a
graduate of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
Institute for Organizational Management, was
named a Santa Barbara Foundation’s Kath-
erine Harvey Fellow in 2007, and is the former
recipient of Produce Business magazine’s ‘‘40
under Forty’’ award that identifies the produce
industry’s top young leaders.
As a Co-Chair of the Congressional Cut
Flower Caucus, I laud Kasey for his service to
this iconic sector of American agriculture and
wish him the best in his future endeavors.
CONGRATULATING WOMEN IN
LEADERSHIP
HON. ANGIE CRAIG
OF MINNESOTA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the City of Burnsville for an historic
achievement—for the first time ever, nearly all
of the city’s top leadership positions are held
by women, including the mayor, the school su-
perintendent, the city manager, the president
of the Chamber of Commerce, the executive
director of the convention and visitors bureau,
chair of the county commissioners, five school
board members, the new police chief, and an
at-large City Council member.
When women hold these positions, our chil-
dren grow up knowing that women are fully
capable of leading and driving change in their
communities. Burnsville Mayor Elizabeth Kautz
is to be commended not only for her service,
but also for her leadership in ensuring more
women are at the policymaking table. I’m
proud to not only represent the City of Burns-
ville, but also locate my district office there.
I’m not the only one who has taken notice—
just recently, the women of Burnsville were
featured on a segment on the Today show for
their outstanding work to create stronger com-
munities and serve as role models to young
women everywhere.
As the first woman to ever represent Min-
nesota’s Second Congressional District in the
U.S. House of Representatives, I want to con-
gratulate these women on their hard work,
their leadership, and their demonstration to
communities across Minnesota that women
deserve a seat at the table. This is what lead-
ership looks like.

CLARK
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

Friday, August 2, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today

Clark moved to the District of Columbia in
1970, at a time when D.C. was facing an ad-
diction epidemic. Originally on a path of be-
coming a musician, Clark’s life took on new
purpose after seeing firsthand the damages of
drug addiction and a society ill-equipped to
handle it. Clark took a novel approach to pro-
viding treatment for substance abusers and
created a holistic program that was African-
centered and drug free. RAP, Inc. was one of
the first programs in the District to allow moth-
ers to bring their children into the facility with
them while they participated in treatment. It
was also one of the first programs to provide
services to individuals living with AIDS. Over
the years, his strategy proved to be lifesaving
and redeeming for many D.C. residents.
Clark will also be remembered for his love
of music, in particular jazz, which he carried
into his work, making sure that music was
ever-present in his facilities. As the son of the
musician Roy T. Clark, Clark learned how to
play piano, saxophone and bass at a young
age and later formed a Modern Jazz Society
in his early 20s. He was devoted to jazz and
for a period of time he had a show called
Transitions that aired on Thursdays from mid-
night to 4am on WPFW-FM 89.3.
His organization continues to serve those in
need. His work touched and changed thou-
sands of lives in D.C., bringing families back
together, motivating individuals to choose dif-
ferent pathways for their lives and changing
attitudes of the public about the value of treat-
ment over of sending addicted people to pris-
on.
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in remembering Ronald
Clifford Clark for his strength of character, his
capacity for love, and his commitment to help-
ing others and giving many District of Colum-
bia residents a second chance at a better life.
COMMEMORATING WOMEN’S
EQUALITY DAY
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, later
this month, on August 26, 2019, we will com-
memorate the 99th anniversary of the ratifica-
tion of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Con-
stitution which granted women the right to
vote.
This momentous achievement did not come
easy or without struggle, for as the great aboli-
tionist and orator, Fredrick Douglas stated: ‘‘If
there is no struggle, there is no progress
. . . . Power concedes nothing without a de-
mand. It never did and it never will.’’
The fight for women’s suffrage was waged
over a 72-year period, beginning in Seneca
Falls, New York at the Seneca Falls Conven-
tion in 1848.
At Seneca Falls, the delegates issued the
‘‘Declaration of Sentiments’’ regarding the re-
pression of women in American society.
The Seneca Falls Conference was orga-
nized by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia
Mott, Mary McClintock, and Sojourner Truth,
who powerfully reminded the delegates that
equality and suffrage for women should in-
clude all women, saying ‘‘Ain’t I A Woman?’’
With the end of the Civil War, the suffrage
movement resumed with the 1869 formation of
the National Woman Suffrage Association and
its rival, the American Woman Suffrage Asso-
ciation.
By 1890, these two groups merged to cre-
ate the National American Woman Association
led by Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady
Stanton, and Lucy Stone.
The progressive National Women’s Party
was formed in 1916 as an outgrowth of the
Congressional Union and reached out to so-
cial groups beyond the elite class, using rad-
ical tactics in the fight to win suffrage.
During World War I, the struggle for suffrage
continued as the National Women’s Party or-
ganized protests outside the White House,
turning President Wilson’s famous question
back on him, asking: ‘‘Mr. President, how
much longer must women wait for liberty?’’
These protests resulted in the jailing of suf-
fragists for ‘‘obstruction of traffic’’ and they en-
dured mistreatment and forced-feeding while
in jail.
Among the courageous women who orga-
nized these protests and some who spent time
in jail were Alice Paul, who fearlessly exe-
cuted the National Women’s Party picketing
protests, and conceived the hunger-strike in
prison; Carrie Chapman Catt, who devised the
‘‘winning plan’’ at the Atlantic City Convention;
and Ida B. Wells-Barnett, whose political activ-
ism and criticism of the suffrage leadership for
excluding black women led to a more inclusive
and effective movement.
The pressure generated by the White House
pickets, the arrests, and forced-feedings of
women protestors compelled President Wilson
to embrace the suffrage amendment in Janu-
ary 1918, which was approved by Congress
on June 4, 1919, and became the 19th
Amendment to the United States Constitution
when it was ratified by the 36th state, Mis-
sissippi, on August 26, 1920.
The 19th Amendment states:
‘‘The right of citizens of the United States
to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the
United States or by any states on the ac-
count of sex.’’
In 1971, Congresswoman Bella Abzug of
New York introduced legislation designating
August 26 as ‘‘Women’s Equality Day,’’ which
was passed by the Congress in 1973.
Madam Speaker, in 1916, four years before
the ratification of the 19th Amendment,
Jeannette Rankin was elected to the U.S.
House of Representatives from Montana, the
first woman elected to federal office in Amer-
ican history.
A little over a century later, a record 102
women serve in the House of Representa-
tives, comprising 23.4 percent of the cham-
ber’s voting members, and presided over by
NANCY PELOSI, the first and only woman elect-
ed Speaker of the House.
In the 116th Congress, 37 percent of
women are women of color, and since 1964,
more than 70 women of color have been
elected to Congress.
While women obtained the fundamental
right to vote, they are still too often treated as
second class citizens in our society and there
remains much work to do to ensure that
women enjoy full blessings of liberty and
equality.
But this does not detract the achievements
and contributions to the greatness of our
country made by American women, including
Sally Kristen Ride, the first woman sent into
space; Eileen Marie Collins, the first woman
space shuttle pilot; Grace Murray Hopper, an
American computer scientist and United
States Navy rear admiral; and Katherine John-
son, one of the unsung heroes of the NASA
Space Program, whose mathematical calcula-
tions helped the United States win the Space
Race.
The technology sector represents $1.2 tril-
lion of economic activity but women only make
up 20 percent of tech jobs.
In 2019, 41,000 new tech jobs were cre-
ated, but female founders only account for 2.1
percent of the leadership in these new tech
jobs.
Studies have shown that there has been a
decline over the last 20 years in the percent-
age of bachelor’s degrees in computer science
earned by women of color, from 6.5 percent in
1993 to 4.8 percent in 2012.
During this same period, for minority women
in engineering, the increase was less than 1
percent.
The low number of women in the tech in-
dustry is an effect of the pipeline, the lack of
resources and education for young women
studying STEM.
It is important that we ensure that all young
women, especially those of color have equi-
table access to the STEM field.
The tech industry is one of the fastest grow-
ing industries in America’s economy, and
when women are involved, the outcomes are
triumphant.
In 2019, several women have been recog-
nized for their work as CEOs of major cor-
porations, such as Lynsy Snide of In-N-Out
Burger; Cathy Engelbert of Deloitte; and Col-
leen Wegman of Wegmans Food Market.
Seven female CEOs are among the U.S.
top 100, and 3 women earn honors for leading
U.S. small and midsize businesses. Women of
color represent a very small part of this popu-
lation.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1029
August 2, 2019
Women still represent only 6.6 percent of all
Fortune 500 CEOs, and 5 percent of CEO po-
sitions at S&P 500 companies.
Despite major accomplishments in the busi-
ness field, women are underrepresented in
senior leadership positions.
Madam Speaker, the gender pay gap is the
gap between men and women’s median sala-
ries.
In 2017, a woman made less than 80 per-
cent of what a man earns, which is even less
than the amounts earned by Hispanic of
Latina women (53 percent), African American
women (61 percent), and American Indian or
Alaska Native Women (58 percent).
The largest gender pay gaps are in the
medical profession and in fields such as finan-
cial services, accounting, medical and health
service, and education administrators.
Madam Speaker, the precarious position of
women was documented in ‘‘The Shriver Re-
port: A Woman’s Nation Pushes Back from the
Brink,’’ published in January 2014.
The Shriver Report found that in an era
when women have solidified their position as
half of the U.S. workforce and two-thirds of the
primary or co-breadwinners in American fami-
lies, the reality is that a third of all American
women are living at or near ‘‘the brink of pov-
erty,’’ defined as less than 200 percent of the
federal poverty line, or about $47,000 per year
for a family of four.
Forty-two million women, and the 28 million
children who depend on them, are living one
single incident—a doctor’s bill, a late pay-
check, or a broken-down car—away from eco-
nomic ruin.
Women make up nearly two-thirds of min-
imum-wage workers, the vast majority of
whom receive no paid sick days.
All of this is happening at a time when
women earn most of the college and ad-
vanced degrees in this country, make most of
the consumer spending decisions by far, and
are more than half of the nation’s voters.
Madam Speaker, if we are going to win the
war on poverty, we must wage and win the
war of discrimination of women in the work-
force.
As we celebrate Women’s Equality Day and
the accomplishments of women, especially the
rise of those in the areas of government, edu-
cation, business, and the military, it is crucial
that as we reflect on how far women have
come, we also not lose sight of far we have
to go and what must be done to achieve true
gender equality so every girl everywhere can
pursue her dreams and realize her potential.
As the legendary Congresswoman Shirley
Chisholm said, ‘‘If they don’t give you a seat
at the table, bring a folding chair.’’

HONORING DR. NEAL GIPSON
HON. RODNEY DAVIS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Neal
Gipson, a WWII veteran in my district who will
turn 100 on August 15th.
After his college graduation, Neal entered
the Naval Academy, and in January of 1943,
he was commissioned as an ensign in the
Naval Reserve. He spent three years doing
coastal minesweeping and submarine patrol
until he was called to Naval Flight training.
When the war came to an end in 1945, Neal
took the opportunity to go to medical school.
He graduated with his M.D. in 1950 and
jumped right back into military service, joining
the Air Force. Over the next ten years, Neal
took various assignments all over the country:
in Florida, Louisiana, and Alaska until he en-
rolled in Rochester University in New York to
complete a Master’s degree in Nuclear
Science.
Upon his retirement in 1973, Neal’s military
career spanned more than thirty years. He
practiced radiology in the private sector until
his retirement in 1993.
In August, Neal will celebrate his 100th
birthday. His selfless service to our country is
beyond admirable, and I am thankful to have
the opportunity to honor him today.
I thank Neal, and wish him a happy birth-
day.

COMMEMORATING THE 170TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF TEMPLE SHALOM
HON. DAVID B. McKINLEY
OF WEST VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate the 1701h anniversary
of Temple Shalom, West Virginia’s oldest Jew-
ish congregation.
Temple Shalom is in my hometown of
Wheeling, West Virginia—the city in which
West Virginia officially declared statehood in
1861. The congregation has been active
longer than West Virginia has been a state.
The Jewish community has played a pivotal
role in the fabric of our society. As our found-
ing father George Washington came before
the Hebrew Congregations of Newport, Rhode
Island, in 1790, he promised to deliver the reli-
gious freedom and liberty sought by individ-
uals in pursuit of ‘‘a more perfect Union.’’
On Saturday mornings, the respected mem-
bers of Temple Shalom gather together to
pray to G-d and read Torah.
It is with the upmost respect and honor that
I would like to extend my highest regards and
gratitude to Temple Shalom and its active role
in the city of Wheeling.
Mazel tov to Temple Shalom as they cele-
brate their 170th year. We look forward to
your continued legacy in our community.

RECOGNIZING THE STUDENT VET-
ERANS OF AMERICA CHAPTER
AT FOX VALLEY TECHNICAL
COLLEGE
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the dedication and out-
standing service ofthe Student Veterans of
America Chapter at Fox Valley Technical Col-
lege.
In 2008, the national Student Veterans of
America organization was created to provide
programs, resources, and support to student-
veterans. Student Veterans of America’s mis-
sion is to offer the assistance needed in high-
er education to support veterans through their
graduation to gainful employment.
Shortly after its establishment, student-vet-
erans like Chris McKeithan at Fox Valley
Technical College saw the need for a vet-
erans’ club on campus and worked to institute
the club at FVTC.
Since the establishment of the Student Vet-
erans of America chapter in 2011, members
have worked closely with the Appleton com-
munity to coordinate veteran events and re-
source fairs, as well as raise funds for veteran
causes throughout the area.
Staff Advisors Bill Trombley and Mike
Gawel, along with current club officers Rodney
Schreiber, Thomas Barrett, and Chris
McKeithan are pivotal in creating a campus
where veterans feel connected and supported
by both the staff and fellow students at FVTC.
I am proud to have a veteran-run organiza-
tion in my district whose dedication to helping
other veterans goes beyond their active duty
or deployments. To answer the call to serve
the nation and to continue their service to the
local community is truly inspiring.
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this
body to join me in applauding the Student Vet-
erans of America Chapter at Fox Valley Tech-
nical College, its club officers, and its staff ad-
visors for their service to veterans and
servicemembers within the Fox Valley Tech-
nical College District.

Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I rise with
a heavy heart in honor of Dr. Alice Johnson,
who passed away on July 22, 2019 at the age
of 91.
Dr. Johnson was a renowned educator, writ-
er, and playwright who touched the lives of all
who knew her. She began her career as an el-
ementary school teacher and later became a
reading specialist and then a writer. She stud-
ied creative writing under Nobel Laureate
Isaac Bashevis Singer and novelist Evelyn
Wilde Mayerson. She published 19 books and
served as playwright for over a dozen plays.
Throughout her life, she received numerous
accolades, including the Miami-Dade County
‘‘In the Company of Women’’ Award.
Dr. Johnson was an active member of the
Miami-Dade community for more than four
decades. She belonged to Christ The King
Catholic Church, where she was known for
her charitable contributions and her original
play ‘‘Women of the Bible,’’ which was written
for the women of the Christ the King.
She will be missed and remembered with
love and pride.

SOUTHWEST FLORIDA’S 12-YEAR-
OLD SABINE RIVERA ADVOCATES
FOR MORE DIABETES RESEARCH
FUNDING
HON. FRANCIS ROONEY
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to congratulate Sabine Rivera, a 12-
year-old from Southwest Florida who is doing
important work to advocate for more diabetes
research funding. She and more than 100
other children have traveled to Washington
with the Junior Diabetes Research Foundation
to ask that members of Congress renew the
special diabetes program.
Sabine has type 1 diabetes and relies on in-
sulin in her day-to-day life. As the price of in-
sulin continues to rise drastically, some Ameri-
cans are being forced to ration their doses,
which is dangerous and potentially deadly.
Last summer, Sabine’s family was paying
$450 a month for insulin.
This is why Sabine advocates for herself
and other diabetes patients. She is working
hard to convince legislators to fund more dia-
betes research and to hopefully find a cure. In
30 years, more than 5 million Americans are
expected to have type 1 diabetes, so decreas-
ing the cost of insulin and working to find a
cure is an important issue for a growing por-
tion of America’s citizens.
I am grateful for Sabine and her passion to
fight for diabetes patients across the nation. I
am proud to have her as a member of our
Southwest Florida community and look for-
ward to her bright future.

MEDICAL WOMEN’S
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION
HON. KIM SCHRIER
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, I ask my
colleagues to join me in recognizing the 100th
anniversary of the Medical Women’s Inter-
national Association (MWIA), one of the oldest
international professional organizations, rep-
resenting women doctors worldwide.
In 1919 New York City, American physician,
Dr. Esther Pohl Lovejoy, along with inter-
national colleagues from 16 nations, founded
MWIA and became its first President. Over the
century, MWIA has grown to encompass over
80 countries as either national associations,
like the American Medical Women’s Associa-
tion, or as individual members.
One hundred years ago, there were very
few women in the medical field. Organizations
like MWIA provided support for women in
medicine and more importantly provided a
community for them to share medical knowl-
edge as well as promote collegiality around
the world. At the time of MWIA’s founding, a
major challenge for women was the accessi-
bility of medical education. Fortunately, this
obstacle has been overcome in many nations.
The sacrifice of these earlier trailblazing doc-
tors helped pave the way for future ones like
me.
Yet the number of women in senior leader-
ship positions shows that the work of MWIA is
far from over. By investing in women physi-
cians, MWIA provides the network and support
system to mentor and advocate for future
leaders in the medical field. In addition, MWIA
works to improve the health of women world-
wide, advocating for gender specific
healthcare, promoting equity, and addressing
social determinants of health.
Congratulations again to the MWIA for their
100 years of important work. Their tireless
work to open doors for women in medicine
has improved the health of generations of
women, men and children around the world,
and for that, we all are grateful.

IN HONOR OF GARRY BRYDGES
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
today I pay tribute to Garry Brydges, PhD,
DNP, MBA, ACNP–BC, CRNA, FAAN. Dr.
Brydges will soon complete his year as na-
tional president of the American Association of
Nurse Anesthetists (AANA). I am proud that
Dr. Brydges was elected as the 2018–2019
president of this prestigious national organiza-
tion.
Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists
(CRNAs) are advanced practice registered
nurses who administer approximately 43 mil-
lion anesthetics to patients each year. They
work in every setting in which anesthesia is
delivered including hospital surgical suites, ob-
stetrical delivery rooms, ambulatory surgical
centers, and the offices of dentists, podiatrists,
and specialty surgeons. They also provide
acute and chronic pain management services
to patients in need of such care. CRNAs pro-
vide anesthesia for all types of surgical cases
and are the sole anesthesia providers in many
rural hospitals.
As a CRNA for over 15 years, Dr. Brydges
has contributed greatly to the healthcare com-
munity in the Houston area and nationwide.
Having served in many capacities on profes-
sional associations, including on boards of di-
rectors at the state and national levels, Dr.
Brydges has long been active in nurse anes-
thesia. He is a former president of the Texas
Association of Nurse Anesthetists and has had
extensive success in leading large organiza-
tions through healthcare policy development,
strategic planning, evidence-based practice,
outcome research, and education. In addition,
Dr. Brydges has mentored students across all
nursing disciplines through professional devel-
opment and clinical nursing excellence.
Dr. Brydges earned his executive Master of
Business Administration degree from Texas
Women’s University in Houston. He earned his
Doctorate of Nursing Practice from Texas
Christian College in Fort Worth, Texas. In ad-
dition, he graduated with a Master of Nursing
in nurse anesthesia, and a Master of Nursing
in Acute Care Nurse Practitioner from the Uni-
versity of Texas at Houston.
During his AANA presidency, Dr. Brydges
has been a prominent advocate for the pa-
tients and practice of nurse anesthesia before
federal agencies and members of Congress.
He has worked tirelessly to promote anes-
thesia patient safety and the value of CRNAs
to our healthcare system, especially when it
comes to dealing with chronic pain and the
opioid crisis. Dr. Brydges has worked to have
CRNAs recognized as Full Practice Providers
in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA),
to maintain provider non-discrimination, and to
achieve full scope of practice for CRNAs, in-
cluding chronic pain management and related
services in the Medicare system.
I extend my sincere congratulations to Dr.
Brydges today on a job well done. His service
to the AANA and to his patients, and his com-
mitment to safe, quality anesthesia care na-
tionwide, are highly commendable. I ask my
colleagues to join me in recognizing Dr.
Brydges’ notable career and outstanding
achievements.

HONORING FRANK WILLS
HON. DWIGHT EVANS
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Frank Wills, who in 1972, at the age of
24 years old, worked as a security guard at
the Watergate Complex in Washington, DC.
June 17, 1972, Mr. Wills was on-duty and
making his routine rounds of surveilling the
property he was hired to secure. During his
rounds, he discovered duct tape placed over a
latch bolt on the basement door of the building
adjacent to a stairwell near the parking ga-
rage.
It is now known that the tape was placed by
burglars who entered the building to steal con-
fidential documents from the office of the
Democratic National Committee headquarters,
which was located on the sixth floor of the
building. Mr. Wills explained to federal inves-
tigators that he checked the basement door 45
minutes ahead of his scheduled time because
he had a sense that something was amiss. He
was correct.
President Richard Nixon had hired five men,
including a former CIA official to commit the
burglary. Thanks to Mr. Wills keen and ob-
servant eye, a trail of related break-ins, cor-
ruption, wiretapping, slush funds and con-
nected crimes were revealed. It led to the
eventual resignation of a president.
By most accounts, Mr. Wills should have
been a decorated member of the law enforce-
ment community as, he played a pivotal role
in exposing what would later become one of
America’s most notorious scandals. He wasn’t.
He resigned from his position due to racist
treatment at work and had difficulty finding
suitable employment due to prospective em-
ployers being afraid of associating with him.
Employers were fearful of hiring him due to
the threat of losing federal funding. He moved
to Georgia with his mother and lived off her
monthly Social Security payment.
Frank Wills passed away on September 27,
2000 at the age of 52. He should be remem-
bered as a hidden figure in our nation as his
actions created a catalyst for one of our na-
tion’s greatest political scandals.
On behalf of the 3rd Congressional District
of Pennsylvania and the city of Philadelphia I
extend gratitude to the late Frank Wills for his
bravery and service to our country.

HONORING MARY RUTH PARDUE
HON. PETE STAUBER
OF MINNESOTA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor a remarkable woman named
Mary Ruth Pardue. Mary’s life serves as an
example of what it means to be a true Amer-
ican patriot, public servant, and caregiver.
Mary became a registered nurse after re-
ceiving a bachelor’s degree in nursing from
the University of Virginia Nursing College.
Shortly after the United States entered World
War II, Mary joined the United States Army
Nurse Corps and was commissioned as a
Second Lieutenant.
She served our country courageously in the
North African and Italian campaigns as a trau-
ma and surgical nurse. When a soldier re-
ceived a terrible injury, Mary was often the
first person on the scene, ready to provide
first-rate care.
Mary’s bravery and compassion did not go
unnoticed. She was awarded a Bronze Star
for her actions in protecting her patients while
under fire from hostile forces in northern Italy.
Madam Speaker, Mary recently passed
away in Duluth, Minnesota shortly after her
100th birthday. Her devotion to her country
and to the health of our citizens will never be
forgotten. My prayers and condolences go out
to her family and loved ones.

RECOGNIZING THE VETS 4 VETS
PROGRAM AT UNIVERSITY OF
WISCONSIN-GREEN BAY
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 2, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the dedication and out-
standing service of the Vets 4 Vets program at
University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.
Vets 4 Vets has been a student organization
at University of Wisconsin-Green Bay since
the Vietnam War. Following the Vietnam War,
Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation En-
during Freedom, the club has seen incredible
membership and activity as veterans support
their peers who return home and attend
school at UW-Green Bay.
Vets 4 Vets is a key resource on the UW-
Green Bay campus, focusing on volunteering
and fundraising for veteran causes in the area.
They play a critical role in connecting student-
veterans with peers, the campus, and the
greater Green Bay community. Staff Advisor
Elaina Koltz, along with current student club
officers Ryan Leurquin, Shauna Rafferty, Eric
Mattos, Hannah Roskopf, and Zachary Flores
are pivotal in creating a campus where vet-
erans feel connected and supported by both
the staff and fellow students.
Recently, members of Vets 4 Vets worked
hard with the community and administrators of
UW-Green Bay to open ‘‘At Ease’’ Veteran &
Service Member Student Lounge. This space
allows veterans to relax, share stories, and
study around other veterans. This is just one
example of the numerous initiatives that Vets
4 Vets assists with.
I am proud to have a veteran-run organiza-
tion in my district whose dedication to sup-
porting fellow veterans goes beyond their time
on active duty. This student organization truly
demonstrates what it means to engage in self-
less service.
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this
body to join me in applauding Vets 4 Vets, its
club officers, and its staff advisor for their
service to veterans at University of Wisconsin-
Green Bay.
