f
50TH ANNIVERSARY OF SODDY-
DAISY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Tennessee (Mr. FLEISCHMANN) for 5
minutes.
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to honor the great people of
Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee, as we all cele-
brate the 50th anniversary of this com-
munity.
Mr. Speaker, I am so privileged and
honored to represent 11 wonderful east
Tennessee counties in this great peo-
ple’s House. My largest county is Ham-
ilton County. Perhaps you have heard
of a city there called Chattanooga.
That is our largest city. But right up
the road is a very special place: Soddy-
Daisy, Tennessee.
Soddy-Daisy has a great history. It
has been a city for 50 years. But long
before that, it all started with the con-
struction of Poe’s Tavern in 1819, which
Hasten Poe of Soddy-Daisy called
home. In the years to follow, the tav-
ern served as a hospital during the
Civil War and was torn down later, but
a replacement is there today.
Depending on whom you ask, you
may get one of several stories about
how Soddy-Daisy got its name. Some
say it was an adaptation of an Indian
name meaning ‘‘sipping place’’; others
will tell you it derived from the name
of a trading post owned by William
Sodder, nicknamed ‘‘Soddy.’’
As time went on after the Civil War,
it was home to mostly Scots; then,
later, Welshmen came, and they
brought coal mining to the region. The
industry grew and the Daisy Coal Com-
pany was founded by Thomas Parks,
who named it after his daughter,
Daisy. The coal company expanded,
and the region became known as
‘‘Daisy.’’
Mr. Speaker, in 1969, America put a
man on the Moon, and a little ball club
I am very fond of in New York, the
Mets, won the world series. I was 7
years old then, and I didn’t know that
somewhere in Hamilton County, Ten-
nessee, the great people of Soddy and
Daisy were coming together to put to-
gether a beautiful city.
About a week or two ago, I cele-
brated their 50th anniversary as a city.
And today, joining us in this great peo-
ple’s House are the men and women
who serve on that commission. These
are people who volunteer. They serve
without pay. These are truly great
American citizens. I want to talk about
them right now.
We have got Mayor Gene-o Shipley
and his wife, DeDe; Vice Mayor Robert
Cothran and his wife, Wanda; Commis-
sioner Jim Adams and his wife, Shir-
ley; Commissioner Max Lowe and his
wife, Teresa; and Commissioner Rick
Nunley and his wife, Katherine.
I also want to recognize Soddy-Daisy
City Manager Janice Cagle; and at that
celebration, the very first mayor of
Soddy-Daisy, Max Orr, was present,
and he is still a prominent figure in
that great community today.
I know in Soddy-Daisy and in Sale
Creek and communities in Hamilton
County today, right now, Mr. Speaker,
schoolchildren are watching us in the
public schools. I want to tell them that
their parents, grandparents, and the
founders of this great community have
been great Americans.
Soddy-Daisy has a rich past. I have
been with this wonderful community in
times of triumph and in times of trag-
edy. I have been there when they had
floods. Their community is a great
community—good, good people, won-
derful people.
Now, as bright as the past has been,
I want to tell the students who are
watching today that the future is going
to be even brighter for Soddy-Daisy,
Tennessee. This is a community that
loves God, loves our country, and loves
our veterans. It is a special place.
Mr. Speaker, I wish Soddy-Daisy and
the great citizens there a very happy
birthday and Godspeed.

HONORING GURU NANAK
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes.
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to honor an important historical figure
in the Sikh community on what will
soon be the 550th anniversary of the
Sikh religion.
Guru Nanak was the founder of
Sikhism, the fifth largest religion in
the world, but his story is largely un-
known to the Western world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8148 October 16, 2019
Guru Nanak was born in November of
1469 in present-day Pakistan. Accord-
ing to Sikh traditions, the birth and
early years of his life were marked
with many events that demonstrated
that he had been marked by divine
grace.
He traveled far and wide, teaching
people the message of one universal
creator and that God is good and that
God is everywhere. Guru Nanak also
preached the universal message of jus-
tice and equality for all women’s em-
powerment, service to others, and a de-
votion to nature and the environment.
Every year, Sikh pilgrims travel to
his birthplace to remember his life and
his message of love, compassion, and
kindness, these values that we hold
true every day.
I know from personal experience in
my interactions with the Sikh leaders
across my district and throughout this
country that these values are instilled
in each and every one of us and them.
Unfortunately, one such Sikh leader
tragically passed away a week ago, and
her loss is heavily felt by so many
members, not only throughout Cali-
fornia, but in India.
HONORING JASBIR ‘‘GUDDI’’ SIDHU
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
celebrate a beloved member of the Sikh
community in my home of Fresno,
California: Ms. Jasbir ‘‘Guddi’’ Sidhu.
Guddi lived an admirable life and
made so many, countless contributions
to our communities. For 25 years, she
produced a weekly television show and
was a founding member of KBIF 900, a
local radio station.
Her weekend programming featured
interviews with community members
and cultural figures. She was a role
model and a leader to all, especially
young girls and women. It not only
aired in Fresno, but also halfway
around the world, in India. It was also
streamed by thousands on social
media.
Guddi was a member of numerous
local organizations and worked hard to
preserve the Punjabi culture and Sikh
religion for children and families in her
community and helped those assimi-
late who came from Punjab.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to
join me in honoring the service of
Jasbir ‘‘Guddi’’ Sidhu, a beloved mem-
ber of our community, who had a pas-
sion for people and made a difference.
SYRIA CRISIS
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to draw attention to the recent events
transpiring in northern Syria.
Turkey’s continuing actions against
the Kurds in northern Syria is not only
appalling, but it is unjustifiable, and it
is not right.
The Kurds have courageously fought
side by side with our troops and de-
serve better, losing over 10,000 of their
soldiers in defeating ISIL as the caliph-
ate, but yet ISIL could come back.
They are also guarding thousands of
ISIS prisoners.
The Kurds have been our partners.
The United States must immediately
impose sanctions on Turkey for their
irresponsible and outrageous behavior.
This White House’s actions, I believe,
have made the situation possible; and
now Congress must act to confront this
unfolding humanitarian disaster, which
is also a threat to our national secu-
rity and damaging to our international
reputation.
I will be supporting bipartisan legis-
lation to confront the administration
and Turkey on this matter later this
week. I support H.J. Res. 77, which ex-
presses the Congress’ opposition to the
administration’s abandonment of our
Kurdish allies.
Though Turkey is a NATO ally, we
cannot stand by and let this happen in
the face of reckless and irresponsible
behavior on Turkey’s part. And this
isn’t the first time Turkey has acted in
this way.
This action has become necessary be-
cause of the unilateral actions that the
President took without consulting
Congress or our European allies. It
makes no sense.
It is critical that we maintain our
friendships and our alliances. America
needs to have our alliances. We need to
have friends.
When there is no longer a priority for
this administration to embark upon
maintaining our relationships with our
allies—our friends—we go down a per-
ilous path, mark my words. The United
States needs its friends, and actions
like this undermine our global image
and risk us being seen as an unreliable
partner in international affairs. We
don’t want to be seen as an unreliable
partner in international affairs.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to
join me in calling for responsible lead-
ership, on a bipartisan basis, on this
issue.
f
RURAL BROADBAND
DEVELOPMENT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss an
issue that is incredibly important to
me as a senior member of the House
Agriculture Committee.
My vision for the future of rural
America includes rebuilding the com-
munities that provide much of our
food, fiber, and energy, and to provide
support for a robust rural economy. Of
course, this is virtually impossible
without reliable, high-speed, 5G
broadband connectivity.
In the late 1800s, Thomas Edison cre-
ated the first practical incandescent
lightbulb. By 1925, half of all homes in
the United States had electricity.
Today, we take electricity for granted.
We don’t think twice when we flip a
switch.
As we continue to experience today’s
modern technical revolution, it is my
goal to see 5G broadband just as com-
monplace. Twenty-four million Ameri-
cans still do not have access to
broadband, and the vast majority of
these people live in rural areas.
A 2017 study by the United States De-
partment of Agriculture discovered
that 29 percent of American farmers
did not have reliable internet access,
despite the fact that agriculture is all
about technology today. Without reli-
able broadband access, we are leaving
money on the table, and the American
economy is failing to meet its fullest
potential.
Connectivity and competition go
hand in hand, and we can continue to
invest in rural communities with 5G.
Agriculture, healthcare, energy, edu-
cation, and so many other industries
demand this level of service.
In 2018, we ushered in a new farm bill
that underscored the importance of
broadband in rural America. Under
broadband guaranteed lending pro-
grams, larger rural communities are
permitted to build infrastructure for
telecommunication networks.
The farm bill also supports
broadband development where it is
most needed by prioritizing funds to
rural communities that are at least 90
percent unserved.
We can also encourage innovation on
this front through opportunity zones.
Established by the 2017 Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act, Mr. Speaker, opportunity
zones incentivize long-term invest-
ments—private-sector investments—in
rural, underserved, or economically
distressed areas across the Nation
through public-private partnerships.
In the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania, there are 300 opportunity
zones—there are 18 congressional dis-
tricts—and I am proud that 31 of these
are in my district.
To tackle broadband development
head-on, the FCC has introduced the
idea of gigabit opportunity zones, and
the proposal has a promising future
ahead of it. Gigabit opportunity zones
are designed specifically to address un-
derserved areas by incentivizing State
and local governments to foster
connectivity, ultimately streamlining
regulations, supporting job creators,
and strengthening our neighborhoods.
Mr. Speaker, with continued invest-
ment in 5G broadband development,
the future of rural America looks
bright.

help to ensure that low-income seniors
are matched with the Medicare part D
prescription drug program that is best
for them.
I continue to hear from folks in New
Hampshire who are struggling to pay
for Medicare prescription drugs, often
being forced to choose between gro-
ceries or rent, and the medications
that they need.
Far too many Americans are forced
to make these impossible choices be-
tween basic necessities for their fami-
lies and their prescription medications.
This legislation will help some of our
most vulnerable Americans afford the
medications they depend on to stay
healthy, and it will save taxpayer dol-
lars.
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this important bill.
f
STATEWIDE AWARD FOR
HOMETOWN HERO STEVE BOT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Minnesota (Mr. EMMER) for 5 minutes.
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate St. Michael’s
city administrator, Steve Bot, for re-
ceiving the 2019 James F. Miller Lead-
ership Award from the League of Min-
nesota Cities.
This award is the most prestigious
award for nonelected public servants in
the State of Minnesota. Our office has
the honor of working with Steve
through his role as chair of the I–94
West Corridor Coalition which works
to expand and improve this vital trans-
portation route in Minnesota’s Sixth
District.
We recently joined Steve at St. Mi-
chael’s new public works facility and
saw firsthand the incredible work he is
doing in St. Michael. It is evident that
Steve’s efforts to improve his commu-
nity have been noticed by many, at
home and around the State of Min-
nesota.
I congratulate Steve on this well-de-
served award and thank him for every-
thing he does for our community.
RECOGNIZING LAKE RIDGE CARE CENTER FOR 100
YEARS OF EXCELLENT CARE
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Lake Ridge Care
Center in Buffalo, Minnesota, for pro-
viding outstanding care for our seniors.
This year marks the center’s 100th
anniversary. For a century, this facil-
ity has offered short- and long-term
care for older adults. Since a large
number of residents are not mobile, the
staff of this 100-year-old facility found
a new way to get residents moving by
starting a ‘‘Daily Boogie Walk’’ with
music playing over a sound system.
With music requests from the 1950s
and beyond, residents have been moti-
vated to exercise. As a result, the cen-
ter’s quality measures rose from 41 per-
cent to 70 percent of residents walking.
They rose by 130 spots in our State’s
rankings.
Congratulations to the staff at Lake
Ridge Care Center for their innovation
and going above and beyond, and
thanks for caring for our seniors with a
profound level of care.
CONGRATULATING BRYAN SCHAFER ON 33 YEARS
OF SERVICE
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Bryan Schafer,
development director of planning and
community for the city of Blaine. He
has done an incredible job. Bryan is of-
ficially retiring after 33 years of serv-
ice.
Bryan started with the city in June
of 1986 as a code compliance officer.
Later, he became the city planner.
Since 2000, he has been the director for
the city. Bryan has left a lasting im-
pact on our community.
Bryan’s fingerprints are on the larg-
est projects in Blaine, from the TPC
Twin Cities golf course, which is home
of the 3M Open—PGA Tour event, to
the largest housing development Blaine
has seen thus far, The Lakes, which
added revenue and growing families to
the city. Most notably, Bryan secured
580 acres of land that now serves as the
Blaine Wetland Sanctuary.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Bryan for his
service to the city. Good luck to him in
his retirement.
f
EISENHOWER PRESIDENTIAL
LIBRARY AND MUSEUM
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL) for 5 minutes.
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, this
past weekend I had the honor of being
back in my home State in Abilene,
Kansas to honor our 34th President’s
129th birthday, and to rededicate the
newly remodeled Eisenhower Presi-
dential Library and Museum.
I got to see old friends. I got to play
in an old-timers baseball game. I got to
hear part of Ike’s story through the
eyes of his granddaughter, Mary Jean,
and his great-grandson, Merrill
Atwater.
I have had a special connection to
this Presidential museum since I was 9
years old when my dad was honored to
be part of the honor guard for Ike’s fu-
neral procession.
Though I have been to the Eisen-
hower Library and Museum numerous
times, I was once again enthralled with
Ike’s story. I was so impressed with the
beautiful new layout and the mod-
ernization of the museum. This is, in-
deed, a great place to take children, to
help them learn about the story of
America.
Ike’s story, his words, his Kansas val-
ues from over 60 years ago, ring as true
today as they did then. Ike, who was
born on the wrong side of the track,
literally, held hard work and education
in the highest regard. He often spoke of
his home as the heartland of America.
He spoke of the value of being part of
a community and a humble lifestyle.
Ike was a visionary in many ways. He
is now credited as being one of the top
five Presidents in American history,
and perhaps one of the greatest com-
manding generals of all time.
He started the fight for civil rights.
He started NASA, the FAA, as well as
the Department of Education. And, of
course, he was responsible for the
Interstate Highway System which we
rely upon today. But of all the things
which I saw, what struck the loudest
chord was Ike’s battle to end war, or as
he called it ‘‘waging peace.’’ In Ike’s
words, ‘‘I hate war as only a soldier
who has lived it can . . . ‘’
Ike was the first one to coin the
phrase ‘‘peace through strength.’’
Ike went on to say: ‘‘Our economic
strength and military strength are our
Nation’s shields—without which peace
could never be preserved, nor freedom
defended.’’
Dwight D. Eisenhower embodied the
American ideal of success through hard
work, opportunity, and a purposeful
life. I am thrilled this great American
and Kansan will soon be honored with a
national monument here in Wash-
ington, D.C. to celebrate his life and
legacy.
BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, for
over 30 years, I wore a pink tie like the
one I have on today to work almost
every day. October is Breast Cancer
Awareness Month, but what most peo-
ple don’t realize, is that one out of
eight women develop breast cancer in
their life.
As an obstetrician and gynecologist,
I have had to tell hundreds of women
that very bad news. That is why I try
to remember every October, remember
to encourage women to go get their
mammogram done. If you are over the
age of 35 and it has been over a year
since your last mammogram, please
call your physician’s office, talk to a
nurse and ask her: Is it time for you to
go get your next mammogram done?
I think it is good for us to talk about
risk factors for breast cancer, and, of
course, everyone knows that the risk of
a family member having breast cancer
increases your risk, and that may en-
courage you to get your mammogram
done more often and at a younger age.
If you have more than one first-de-
gree relative with breast cancer, you
want to talk to your doctor about some
genetic studies to see if, indeed, you
are carrying some type of a gene muta-
tion that would increase your risk for
breast cancer.
But there are other risk factors as
well that people don’t often think
about. A poor diet that is high in fat
increases your risk of breast cancer;
obesity increases your risk of breast
cancer; lack of exercise increases your
risk of breast cancer; smoking in-
creases your risk of breast cancer; and
a history of radiation exposure to the
chest increases your risk of breast can-
cer.
So a good diet, regular exercise—30
minutes of walking every day—will de-
crease your risk. What people often ask
me about, though, are the ways that
you can prevent breast cancer and de-
crease your risk. I have already men-
tioned a good diet and exercise, but

breastfeeding also protects you and de-
creases your risk for breast cancer, one
more reason why women should con-
sider breastfeeding when they have
their baby.
But what I want to emphasize today
is that most new people diagnosed with
breast cancer had no risk factors. Let
me say that again: Most women who
are diagnosed with breast cancer have
no risk factor at all. That is why it is
important to get your mammogram
done on a regular basis.
The mammogram can pick up breast
cancer 2 or 3 years before you can feel
something, making the cancer much
more treatable.

PRAISING SAGE SAVOIA-DI
GREGORIO
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1

marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I would
like to take a moment to praise my
district’s 2019 Congressional Award
winner, Ms. Sage Savoia-Di Gregorio
from Maplewood, New Jersey.
This award is given to youth who
achieve extraordinary results in four
different categories: public service,
physical fitness, personal development,
and geographic exploration.
Sage was more than up to the chal-
lenge: She joined AmeriCorps and built
outdoor trails in Virginia; she ren-
ovated museums and education centers
in New Jersey; she helped clean and
maintain a natural park in Kentucky;
and she provided disaster relief to vic-
tims of Hurricane Florence in South
Carolina—all this, while she main-
tained a strict workout regime every
week.
She deserves this award, and I am
proud to call her a resident of the 10th
Congressional District of New Jersey.

ADAM SCHIFF CENSURE
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, we
have the solemn duty to find the facts,
to be stewards of the truth. It is the
truth that must guide our work. When
the truth is contorted, twisted, and dis-
regarded, the American people lose.
The fabric of the institution starts to
erode.
Sadly, that is exactly what is hap-
pening with the House Intelligence
Committee under Democratic leader-
ship. It should not have to come to
this.
On numerous occasions, as outlined
in this resolution, the chairman of the
House Intelligence Committee has used
his position to mislead the American
people.
But this resolution is about more
than the actions of one individual.
When false evidence is entered into the
official record or communicated di-
rectly to the American people, the peo-
ple’s House loses the credibility it
needs to function properly.
If the credibility is not restored, if
the American people cannot trust that
the process will be fair and that the in-
formation will be honestly shared, they
will lose trust in the soundness of our
system of government.
This is what this resolution is all
about, and I want to thank Congress-
man BIGGS for introducing it: to pro-
tect the integrity of our proceedings,
which censure is designed to do; to re-
store a process that is fair, objective,
and fact-based; and to reassure the
American people that the stakes and
intensity of our current debate will not
overwhelm their government.
We face a critical moment in the life
of Congress in the history of this coun-
try. History will judge what happens on
this floor.
Mr. Speaker, it should not have to
come to this, but it has. This is not a
decision we take lightly, but it is the
right thing to do.
We serve on this floor as Americans,
not as in a party. We have to stand for
truth. We have to stand for a com-
mittee that many of us don’t even have
the capability or the opportunity to
read what happens. We put a trust into
those individuals to be honest with us
and to the American public.
Mr. Speaker, that is why I urge all of
my colleagues to join me in support of
this resolution: to bring integrity back
to this floor and to this body.

(Mr. VEASEY asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, one of my
favorite pastimes is playing video
games with my 13-year-old son, just as
Atatiana Jefferson was doing with her
8-year-old nephew when she was mur-
dered by a police officer in front of him
in Fort Worth, Texas, this past week-
end.
I rise today to commemorate the leg-
acy of Atatiana, also known as ‘‘Aunt
Tay’’ by her 8-year-old nephew, and
call on our law enforcement to stop
these killings now.
It only took 3 seconds before a police
officer fatally shot this woman in front
of her 8-year-old nephew while they
were playing video games. She didn’t
even have a chance to show her hands.
The reality for many Black and
Brown people in this country is that
this is our America, this is the Amer-
ica that we live in every day. It doesn’t
matter what neighborhood we live in or
how much money we make. This is
what we face.
Until law enforcement reforms their
culture of rogue policing that has led

to the slaughtering of so many people
in this country, justice cannot fully be
served.
Nothing is going to bring Atatiana or
all of those who have been unjustly
killed back, but we have to do better.
We have to hold our law enforcement
accountable and fix the systematic
failures that have brought us here
today. Until then, our communities
cannot have full confidence in those
who are tasked in protecting all of us.

ADAM SCHIFF CENSURE
(Mr. BIGGS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, today, I
will make the motion regarding H. Res.
630, a motion to condemn and censure
the chairman of the House Intelligence
Committee, ADAM SCHIFF.
I am going to let some of my col-
leagues explain further, but I want to
explain to you what the rules are de-
signed to do in the body that we serve
in. They are designed to protect the
voice and the rights of the minority.
That is the way it is.
The majority does not need the rules
to protect its rights because it has the
power to vote at any time what it
wants to happen. But we follow rules so
that all Americans can be represented,
even when they are represented by the
minority party.
That is not happening today. That is
why we have to introduce this motion
to censure. No more secret proceedings.
No more Soviet-style proceedings.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all to vote for my
motion to censure.

GENERAL MOTORS
(Mr. HIGGINS of Nevada asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. HIGGINS of Nevada. Mr. Speak-
er, I stand today in solidarity with
46,000 United Automobile Workers who
are now entering their fifth week on
strike following the expiration of their
contract in September.
Ironically, this September also
marked the end of GM’s third quarter,
where it sold 737,000 vehicles, more
than any other U.S. automaker, re-
cording record profits and capturing
nearly 18 percent of market share.
GM cited product quality and reli-
ability for its continued strong sales.
The United Automobile Workers made
those 737,000 vehicles with pride and
dedication and attention to detail.
The United Automobile Workers
made sacrifices to keep GM whole
when the automaker faced bankruptcy
10 years ago. Now those workers simply
want to keep their families whole with
good healthcare, fair wages, and job se-
curity.
With record sales, a fair deal is with-
in reach, one that secures the long-
term success of General Motors and a
better future for United Automobile
Workers. Let’s get the deal done.
ADAM SCHIFF CENSURE
(Mr. NORMAN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I arrived
yesterday, as all 435 Members did, to
hopefully do the work of the people in
the United States Congress. What did I
find? No legislation to vote on this
week. We are basically not doing any-
thing other than listening to secret
testimony about impeaching this
President who was duly elected in 2016.
Here are some questions for the
American people:
Why are we not voting on lowering
prescription drug prices?
Why are we not voting on USMCA,
which will help every manufacturer
and every business in this country?
Why are we not voting on securing
our border?
Why are we not having a budget?
Why are we not reducing regulations
to help this great economy?
Mr. Speaker, the American people de-
serve better than this. I will sign the
censure to hold ADAM SCHIFF account-
able, which should be done. I urge my
other colleagues to do the same.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND LEG-
ACY OF LIEUTENANT DETECTIVE
GIUSEPPE ‘‘JOE’’ PETROSINO
(Mr. SUOZZI asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the life and legacy
of Lieutenant Detective Giuseppe
‘‘Joe’’ Petrosino, who, 110 years ago,
was assassinated in Sicily while inves-
tigating organized crime. He was the
first NYPD officer killed overseas in
the line of duty.
Born in Padula, Italy, in 1860,
Petrosino arrived in America as a teen-
ager. In 1883, he joined the NYPD and
became the first Italian-language
speaker in the department’s history.
Lieutenant Petrosino was a passionate
crusader against organized crime, and
he eventually rose to lead the Italian
Squad, an elite group of officers tasked
with taking down organized crime
groups in the city.
While on a special mission to infil-
trate the Italian Mafia in Sicily, Lieu-
tenant Petrosino was assassinated. His
memory still lives on. Today, the Lieu-
tenant Petrosino associates in New
York, Padula, and Sicily continue to
preserve his values and dedication to
the NYPD.
We welcome the delegates of the Lt.
Det. Joseph Petrosino Association in
America to the Capitol and thank them
for all they do to sustain his memory
of this New York City police detective
and great American.
Fighting crime requires the sacrifice
of an untold number of men and women
in blue. We thank them and their fami-
lies for putting themselves in harm’s
way on our behalf.
ATTEMPTED COUP NEEDS TO
STOP NOW
(Mr. GOHMERT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, what is
going on with regard to the attempted
coup on a United States President is
really outrageous. It is playing out
now in the House of Representatives.
I am on the Judiciary Committee, as
are other friends. ANDY BIGGS—who
just addressed us—our friend, ANDY
HARRIS, and others went down to the
SCIF where there is supposedly a hear-
ing going on about impeachment. I was
not allowed in, nor were the others
with me who are Members of Congress.
We were told: No, you are not al-
lowed in.
I asked: Who gave that order? Be-
cause until a vote is held on the rules
to change the rules of precedent, it
goes through the Judiciary Committee.
They couldn’t explain.
They said: Well, our staff boss says
an elected Member of Congress cannot
go sit in on a hearing like that.
It is outrageous. They couldn’t say
who said it. It is outrageous. This coup
needs to stop now.
f
STOP DEMONIZING IMMIGRANTS
AND REFUGEES
(Ms. MCCOLLUM asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, last
week President Trump held a rally in
the Twin Cities where, once again, im-
migrants and refugees were demonized.
This time it was the Somali and east
African communities who call Min-
nesota home who were attacked.
We should call those attacks on those
who have come to the United States
seeking a better life for what they are:
racist and wrong.
Since the rally, members of the So-
mali community have come forward
publicly to share their fear of being
targeted: fear to go to work, fear to go
to school, fear to gather socially in
public.
Minnesota has a long and proud his-
tory of welcoming refugees. Minneso-
tans will always stand up for our val-
ues and our neighbors. To my Somali
and east African neighbors, my mes-
sage is clear: You are welcome in Min-
nesota. You are an important part of
the fabric of our community, and the
contributions you make to the State
we all love makes Minnesota stronger.
Your friends and neighbors stand
with you, and together we will con-
tinue to defend our long and proud his-
tory of welcoming refugees.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8152 October 16, 2019
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, it seems
when I came to work this week, I was
coming to work in Moscow, or Beijing,
or Pyongyang, or Havana; not in the
Capital of the free world where we
treasure fairness. Because what are we
doing? We are holding kangaroo courts;
Star Chamber, Soviet-style secret
trials that are used to depose political
opponents. That is what is going on.
Mr. Speaker, I went back to my dis-
trict. I had three townhalls in the last
4 days. I come from a district who
voted for this President and wants a
chance to vote for him again in 12
months. They asked me: Where is the
evidence against this President?
So I went downstairs today to try to
find it. I went down to the SCIF, and as
you heard from the gentleman from
Texas, we were told that I could not
read the testimony of Mr. Volker. It
was refused.
I asked: Who refused it? They
wouldn’t tell me.
I asked to go into the hearing today.
They have a hearing today. They said
to a Member of Congress: You can’t go.
I said: Who refused? They wouldn’t
tell me.
So, Mr. Speaker, it appears that
someone has made a decision, with no
rhyme or reason, of who gets invited to
these things. We have got to stop this.
What are they hiding?
Mr. Speaker, I support the censure
resolution. Open up the windows.
f
RURAL BROADBAND CRISIS
(Mr. DELGADO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to address an urgent crisis in our
communities: access to rural
broadband. Over the district work pe-
riod, I held a field hearing on rural
broadband with FCC Commissioner
Geoffrey Starks, where New York’s
19th Congressional District residents
shared their stories about the need to
improve rural broadband internet in
upstate New York. The commissioner
heard from educators, healthcare pro-
viders, and small business owners all
impacted by this issue.
Following that hearing, I have intro-
duced the Broadband Speed Act and the
Community Broadband Mapping Act.
This legislative package will address
flawed broadband mapping practices
that result in the FCC overcounting
rural communities and require that
projects funded with FCC money are
future-proof, or built to withstand
changes in technology.
This legislation would also allow
local governments, co-ops, community
groups, and small providers to access
funding that would allow them to col-
lect information on local broadband
service in order to challenge a finding
that they are, in fact, served.
Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to
take up this legislation and close the
digital divide.
SCHIFF CENSURE RESOLUTION
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute and to revise
and extend his remarks.)
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to address a con-
cerning issue. The chairman of the
House Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence, whom House Democrats
have chosen to lead their sham im-
peachment inquiry process, has bra-
zenly misled the American people and
has hidden the truth.
Chairman SCHIFF must be held ac-
countable for his actions, and this body
must take a vote on H. Res. 630. As
House Democrats pursue their partisan
impeachment inquiry and clandestine
Soviet-style hearings, this majority
has proven that they cannot be trusted
to act with integrity.
If House Democrats want to impeach
President Trump, they should do so in
a transparent, nonpartisan process.
The American people won’t be fooled
by these cheap tricks. It is time to re-
store order and decorum to this House.
f
MAKE IT EASIER TO GET MENTAL
HEALTHCARE
(Mr. MOULTON asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to ask my colleagues to make it
easier to get mental healthcare. We
should pass the National Suicide Hot-
line Designation Act and make 988 the
national number for mental health
emergencies.
When your house is on fire, you don’t
have to look for a phonebook to know
who to call. You just dial 911. Mr.
Speaker, it ought to be the same way
for mental health emergencies as well.
And that is just the beginning.
Let’s lead by example and change our
culture so getting a mental health
checkup is just part of routine life.
Deployed servicemembers can set an
example by getting a mental health
checkup within 2 weeks of returning
home from their deployments. That bi-
partisan requirement is in the House
version of the NDAA.
Let’s start a conversation in this
country so that getting mental
healthcare is a regular part of life.

NATIONAL PREGNANCY AND
INFANT LOSS AWARENESS MONTH
(Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr.
Speaker, October is National Preg-
nancy and Infant Loss Awareness
Month, and I rise today on behalf of
every parent who has suffered a mis-
carriage, a stillbirth, or an infant loss.
The unanswered questions and mys-
tery, as well as the feelings of guilt
that surround pregnancy loss and the
death of a newborn, add to the excru-
ciating heartache. We see you.
No one should grieve alone. We stand
alongside those who have experienced
this great tragedy and do our best to
comfort, listen, and support. We also
vow to honor the legacy of those pre-
cious lives lost by working to elimi-
nate preventable infant deaths.
Today, we remember the 1 million
pregnancies in the United States that
end in miscarriage, stillbirth, or the
death of a newborn baby each year.
Their intrinsic value, no matter how
short their lifespan, is profound.

CONGRATULATING EAGLE SCOUT
NATHAN MATTIAS
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I
would like to take this time to con-
gratulate Nathan Mattias of Woolwich
Township in south Jersey. He achieved
the honor of being an Eagle Scout.
For his Eagle Scout project, Nathan
built benches with an improved design
to accommodate those in wheelchairs
for easier access when gardening for
the Sisters of St. Francis, a retirement
facility for nuns in the Philadelphia
area.
Through this project, Nathan discov-
ered his passion of engineering and
plans on continuing his interest when
he is in college. It is people like Na-
than who enact change by listening to
the needs of those in our local commu-
nities.
Keep up the good work, Nathan. I
thank him for all he does for south Jer-
sey, and for the United States of Amer-
ica. He is truly our hero and we are
truly proud of him.

(Mrs. LESKO asked and was given

Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I have to
say that I am a proud cosponsor of the
resolution before us today to censure
Congressman ADAM SCHIFF. And I want
to thank my fellow Arizona Congress-
man for leading the effort on this great
job.
We have watched Congressman
SCHIFF say now for 2 years that he had
evidence that President Trump and his
campaign colluded with Russia, but
then when we saw the Mueller report,
we determined that that just was not
accurate.
Then in committee recently Mr.
SCHIFF read a false, made-up narrative
of a conversation he purported to be
between President Trump and the
Ukrainian President. It was absolutely
made up and false, I believe, to try to
deceive the American public.
Then on national TV, Mr. SCHIFF
said: No—when asked—no, our office
did not have any prior contact with the

WE ARE IN A NATIONAL SECURITY
CRISIS
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the
headline of The New York Times yes-
terday said: ‘‘Syrian Forces Rush Into
U.S. Void. Battle Lines Shifting to the
Benefit of Iran, Russia and ISIS,’’ to
the negative impact of the national se-
curity of the United States of America,
because of one simple phone call of this
President to President Erdogan, and
within minutes, the release of vital
U.S. troops to the slaughter of the he-
roic Kurdish troops who lost their lives
and those remaining, and the release of
ISIS family members and ISIS.
We are in a national security crisis. I
believe we should be asking for a no-fly
zone of Turkey over northern Syria,
and we need to find a way to rebuild
Humpty Dumpty’s house.
Let me also indicate that there is no
indication that anything is awry in the
investigation that is proceeding. It is
proceeding in a manner where Demo-
crats and Republicans are able to ask
questions of witnesses, along with their
staff. This is not an independent coun-
sel, and so our committees are doing
the investigation.
All parties are able to be part of that
investigation. And as well, there is no
preclusion to what ultimately may be
open hearings.
Let us be patient. Let us be sober and
somber for this important responsi-
bility under the Constitution of the
United States of America. That is the
way this Congress should behave.

OUR REPUBLIC IS UNDER THREAT
(Mr. KING of Iowa asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is
my privilege and an honor to be recog-
nized to address you here on the floor
of the House of Representatives. I come
here to the floor to address the cir-
cumstances that are historic in the
way they are shaking the very founda-
tion of this Republic.
Our Constitution is under threat, and
our Republic is under threat. There are
secret meetings taking place down in
the House Permanent Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence, the most con-
fidential place in this place, but they
are talking about finding a way to im-
peach the President of the United
States.
They don’t have a charge yet. They
are still looking for one. We went
through 2 years of the Mueller inves-
tigations, and now we are grinding
through this under the guidance of
ADAM SCHIFF, who has a resolution
here that has been presented to this
floor to censure him for the misin-
formation that came out clearly in
front of all the public.
They are cherry-picking quotes from
the people who are testifying. They re-
fused to allow us, just an hour ago, to
go in and even read the Volker tran-
script. They are allowing no excul-
patory evidence that is coming in that
might defend our President. There is
no representation for the President.
They have turned this committee into
a partisan committee.
Mr. Speaker, I will submit that it is
going to be awfully hard for this select
committee to ever function again if it
is going to be a partisan, secret com-
mittee attempting to overturn the
election of the President of the United
States.
f
LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG
PRICES
(Ms. ADAMS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to speak on the alarming rise in
prescription drug costs. America is the
richest, most developed nation in the
world, yet one in four Americans has a
hard time affording lifesaving prescrip-
tions. Families are making impossible
choices between paying the mortgage,
putting food on their tables, or buying
lifesaving medications.
We turned a blind eye to the prescrip-
tion drug ecosystem, and now the sys-
tem has become unsustainable. Ameri-
cans are getting ripped off while other
countries pay far less for the same
drugs.
In 2017, the U.S. spent $333 billion on
prescription medication, up from $236
billion in 2007, an increase of more than
40 percent over 10 years. That is unac-
ceptable.
I have listened to my constituents
who struggle to afford the prescrip-
tions they need, and they want us to
act. This isn’t a partisan issue. It is a
people issue.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support legislation like H.R. 3 so that
the American people no longer are left
with false choices.
f
CENSURE REPRESENTATIVE ADAM
SCHIFF
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong support of my colleague ANDY
BIGGS’ resolution to censure ADAM
SCHIFF for the way he has conducted
this impeachment inquiry behind
closed doors and in secret.
We have seen this pattern of misin-
formation time and time again, where
he throws out false information, like
when he said he had more than cir-
cumstantial evidence that the Presi-
dent colluded with Russia. Then, after
the Mueller report comes out, we find
out there was no collusion. Not once
did he try, by the way, Mr. Speaker, to
present that evidence because there
was no evidence.
Then he goes on and gives this false
representation of the whistleblower re-
port. Of course, we now have seen the
transcript. We know what happened.
There was no quid pro quo, even though
he was alleging quid pro quo.
Now he is holding meetings in secret,
behind closed doors, to impeach a
President of the United States.
Mr. Speaker, we had an election in
2016; Donald Trump was elected. We
have another election next year, and
the people will decide who the Presi-
dent is, not Speaker PELOSI and not
ADAM SCHIFF behind closed doors.
We need transparency, and we need
to end this kangaroo court witch hunt.
Let’s get back to the people’s work
here in this House.

Whereas, instead of quoting directly
from the available transcript, Chair-
man SCHIFF manufactured a false re-
telling of the conversation between
President Trump and President
Zelensky;
Whereas this egregiously false and
fabricated retelling had no relationship
to the call itself;
Whereas these actions of Chairman
SCHIFF misled the American people,
bring disrepute upon the House of Rep-
resentatives, and make a mockery of
the impeachment process, one of this

with Russia;
Whereas then-Ranking Member
SCHIFF negotiated with Russian come-

damage the President of the United

Whereas, according to a New York

the whistleblower prior to the filing of
his complaint, and staff members com-
municated the content of the com-

Whereas Chairman SCHIFF concealed
his dealings with the whistleblower
from the rest of the Intelligence Com-
mittee, and when asked directly in a
television interview whether he had
any contact with the whistleblower, he
lied to the American people and said,
‘‘We have not spoken directly with the
whistleblower.’’;
Whereas members of the Intelligence
Committee have lost faith in his objec-
tivity and capabilities as chairman,
with every Republican member on the
committee having signed a letter call-
ing for his immediate resignation as
chairman; and
Whereas Chairman SCHIFF has hin-
dered the ability of the Intelligence
Committee to fulfill its oversight re-

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
CUELLAR). Under rule IX, a resolution
offered from the floor by a Member

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California is recognized
for 1 hour.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, for
the purpose of debate only, I yield the
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL),
pending which I yield myself such time
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, yes-
terday, the Rules Committee met and
reported a rule, House Resolution 629,
providing for consideration of H.R.
1815, the SEC Disclosure Effectiveness
Testing Act. The rule provides for con-
sideration of the legislation under a
structured rule. It provides 1 hour of
debate equally divided and controlled
by the chair and ranking member on
the Committee on Financial Services.
It self-executes a manager’s amend-
ment that makes technical changes. It
also makes in order four amendments,
two Democratic and two Republican.

The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 3624, the Outsourcing Ac-
countability Act, under a structured
rule. It provides 1 hour of debate equal-
ly divided and controlled by the chair
and ranking member on the Committee
on Financial Services. Finally, it
makes in order two Republican amend-
ments to H.R. 3624.
Mr. Speaker, the bills before us this
week are consumer protection bills.
Together, these bills make an effort to
give everyday Americans access to
clear, digestible information that will
help them make informed investment
decisions.
Mr. Speaker, inequality in this coun-
try is at a historic level. The experi-
ence right now is on par with the Great
Depression and the gilded age. Without
adjustments like the ones proposed in
these bills, it can only get worse.
The most visible indicator of wealth
inequality in America today may be
the Forbes magazine list of the Na-
tion’s 400 richest Americans. In 2018,
the three men at the top of this list—
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Microsoft
founder Bill Gates, and investor War-
ren Buffett—held combined fortunes
worth more than the total wealth of
the poorest half of Americans. Three
men had more wealth than 160 million
Americans.
b 1245
In 1989, the bottom 90 percent of the
U.S. population held 33 percent of all
wealth. By 2016, the bottom 90 percent
of the population held only 23 percent
of wealth. The wealth share of the top
1 percent increased from about 30 per-
cent to approximately 40 percent over
the same period of time. The tax bill
just passed by the House last session
doubles down on this troubling trend.
In 2019, a person in the bottom 10 per-
cent gets a $50 tax cut, and a person in
the top 1 percent gets a $34,000 tax cut.
At the same time, millions of poor and
middle-class people are expected to see
their taxes either stay the same or ac-
tually increase in the long run.
Before us today, the Outsourcing Ac-
countability Act makes one simple but
meaningful change to existing report-
ing requirements. It would add a re-
quirement for publicly traded compa-
nies to annually report foreign and do-
mestic employment statistics to the
SEC: Are your employees working in
the United States or are they working
overseas?
By publicly reporting this data that
already is collected, companies are pro-
viding important information to their
investors, consumers, and American
workers, with no additional burden on
their business.
As Heather Slavkin Corzo of the
AFL–CIO said recently: ‘‘What gets
measured gets paid attention to by a
company’’—and, I would add, their in-
vestors.
As a former union member and a cur-
rent member of the House Committee
on Education and Labor, I think we in
Congress should do everything we can
to incentivize companies to invest in
American workers and not to offshore
their work.
This administration has done every-
thing in its power, in my view, to give
corporations even more power at the
expense of their employees—and these
effects are being felt in households
across this country.
Mr. Speaker, the other bill before us
is the SEC Disclosure Effectiveness
Testing Act. All we are asking for in
this bill is to make sure that the data
we are collecting for consumers is easy
to understand so it can be used in the
way it was intended.
Field testing allows average inves-
tors to pilot a form that the SEC is
planning to use and be a focus group on
whether it is user friendly and the re-
sults are understandable.
A recent form that was field-tested
revealed that everyday Americans were
‘‘deeply confused’’ about the informa-
tion the form was supposed to be com-
municating. In this specific instance,
we are talking about how a company
discloses any conflicts of interest it
may have in providing investment ad-
vice.
Close to 7 million people in my home
State of California and 55 million peo-
ple nationwide, most of them low and
middle income, don’t have access to re-
tirement benefits at work. We are talk-
ing about people who work for small
businesses, whose companies just can-
not afford the expense of financial
products on the market.
In stark contrast, the financial sec-
tor takes around 25 percent of all cor-
porate profits in the United States,
represents 7 percent of the U.S. econ-
omy, and creates a mere 4 percent of
jobs.
Mr. Speaker, this bill makes it easier
for people who are trying to build a se-
cure retirement for themselves and
their families to understand the invest-
ment advice they are receiving and
whether it is in their best interest. We
have an obligation to our workers who
sacrifice and provide so much for our
country to give them something in re-
turn.
These two bills, taken together, help
put consumers in the driver’s seat. One
requires information already collected
by companies to be shared, and the
other makes sure that consumers un-
derstand the information they are
being given.
The only people who should be op-
posed to these bills are big businesses
who may be afraid of what the public
will learn about their practices.
The goal should be to give every
American worker a secure retirement
and protect consumers. Why wouldn’t
we want to take every step to get
there?
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume. I
thank the gentleman from California
(Mr. DESAULNIER), my friend, for yield-
ing me the time today.
Ordinarily, Mr. Speaker, what folks
decide they are going to highlight on
the House floor are all of our disagree-
ments. In fact, the 1 minutes today
highlighted that.
My friend from California and I were
talking before debate began—and I cer-
tainly include you in this partnership,
Mr. Speaker. You lock a couple of us in
the room together, we can solve about
90 percent of what ails this country.
But the media wins—often distracts—
from what is going on, and that is my
frustration today, Mr. Speaker.
I don’t really have any objection
with the rule as it sits before us. We
heard testimony last night from the
ranking member of the Committee on
Financial Services.
To paraphrase his words, he said
these bills were so flawed that he
didn’t even offer any amendments in
committee to try to make them better
because there was no hope for these
bills, no hope in two senses, Mr. Speak-
er: no hope for these bills in that they
were so poorly drafted and poorly di-
rected that they would not benefit the
American people in the ways that they
were intended; and no hope for these
bills in that the Senate will never take
them up and the President will never
put his signature on them because they
are so flawed.
I can’t take responsibility for what
the Committee on Financial Services
did, Mr. Speaker, because I don’t sit on
that committee. I can take responsi-
bility for what the Rules Committee
did last night, Mr. Speaker.
I will tell you that it is the first time
I have had the privilege of coming to
the House floor and speaking on a rule
where Republicans got as many amend-
ments as Democrats did. It is a big day.
I feel a partnership breaking out. I say
to the gentleman from California (Mr.
DESAULNIER), if we can keep this going,
we might really be able to make a dif-
ference.
It has been a frustration of ours, as
you well know, Mr. Speaker, that,
when you are in a majority-driven in-
stitution like this one, being in the
majority has privileges; and a privilege
is that you get to draft the legislation
and then you get to draft the rule to
bring the legislation to the floor, and
you can jam anything through this in-
stitution if you want to.
Generally, our best work isn’t the
work we jam through the institution.
Generally, our best work is the work
that we spend, not hours, not days, but
weeks and months crafting together in
partnership. Most of that work doesn’t
happen here on the House floor. That
work happens in committees. It actu-
ally happens, oftentimes, behind closed
doors, where earnest members can talk
about what their constituents need.
We can pass this rule this afternoon,
and I will offer, later on, an amend-
ment, if we defeat the previous ques-
tion. I think it will make the rule bet-
ter.
But I do believe we have a missed op-
portunity, Mr. Speaker. There is a lot
of work that needs to be done.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8156 October 16, 2019
I have one of my bosses in town
today, Mr. Speaker. Colonel Dennis
Brown is a county commissioner in
Forsyth County.
I was telling him the story that one
of my former bosses said: If you ever
wanted a real job, he was going to run
for county commissioner, because when
you are county commissioner, every-
thing you do impacts somebody’s life.
And nobody shows up at the county
commission and says, ‘‘I have a prob-
lem, and if you are a Republican, I
would like for you to fix it, but if you
are a Democrat, it doesn’t matter to
me,’’ or vice versa. Folks show up and
say, ‘‘I have a problem. I need you all
to work together to fix it.’’
We have real problems here, Mr.
Speaker. We all know, as we heard dur-
ing the 1-minute time this morning,
that drug pricing is a challenge in this
country, and there are lot of different
solutions. There are some more liberal
solutions; there are some more con-
servative solutions; and there are some
middle-of-the-road solutions that bring
people together. I wish we had those on
the floor this week.
We all know that we have immigra-
tion challenges in this country.
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that
about 27 percent of my bosses are first-
generation Americans back home,
folks who so believed in America that
they traded away their entire family’s
life back in their home country to
come and try to make a new life here
in America. I love that we have those
stories to tell.
But we all know the immigration
system is broken. Men and women who
are trying desperately to get here the
right way can’t; men and women who
are coming here the wrong way can. We
all know that there are opportunities
to do better there. We should have
those provisions on the floor.
We all know that Social Security is
underfunded, and in just a few short
years men and women who are depend-
ent on that program are going to run
into that shortfall.
We can’t do those hard things in uni-
fied government, Mr. Speaker. When
Republicans win back the House next
year and win the Presidency back and
continue control of the Senate, that is
going to be the wrong time to do funda-
mental reforms to Medicare and Social
Security and Medicaid. It is going to be
the wrong time to do the big things
that need to be done to get our fiscal
house in order.
The right time is in divided govern-
ment, where we have an opportunity to
put everybody’s fingerprints on a solu-
tion, not that yanks the pendulum left
or right, but that moves the country
deliberately in a direction that we can
all agree on.
But, sadly, that is not why we are
here today, Mr. Speaker.
I listened to the Reading Clerk read
the bill, as is always done, read the
rule, and I think back to some of those
days where the Reading Clerk is read-
ing the appropriations bills or actually
going through meaningful legislation
line by line, opening it up so that every
Member, no matter whom he or she
represents, has an opportunity to come
and offer amendments and make the
bill better.
The ranking member’s testimony is
the bills are so flawed, the committee
didn’t even bother considering amend-
ments to make them better. I am
pleased that the Rules Committee is
going to offer an opportunity to make
them a little bit better with the
amendments that are made in order
today, Mr. Speaker.
But it is my great hope that we will
be able to move past these messaging
bills. Consumer protection isn’t just a
political message. Consumer protection
is a shared goal, from the coast of Cali-
fornia to the coast of Georgia. It is
something that unites us in this insti-
tution, not divides us.
I regret that the apparent legislative
agenda for the week is going to be to
consider bills that get approved or de-
feated on straight party-line votes. We
can do better.
In this current political environ-
ment, the American people may not ex-
pect better, but I know that my bosses
do, and I will continue to press for
that.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume to make a comment to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL),
my friend, as we do this.
I, first of all, express my respect and
affection for him in the short time I
have gotten to serve with him, and I
agree with almost everything he said
in his statement, with a possible excep-
tion of his prediction on the next elec-
tion.
But other than that, I, too, yearn to
be part of this institution, this mar-
velous institution that solves problems
as a premium, where you take a liberal
perspective and a conservative perspec-
tive, where both respect one another
and understand that, by listening to
both, we actually get a product that is
more reflective of the whole.
Having been someone who served at
the city level, the county level—county
commissioner—at the State level, and
now in Congress, it is discouraging to
be here and not be as engaged as I
hoped to in problem-solving and re-
specting differences of opinion.
So we will get through this. The
Speaker likes to quote Lincoln: With
public sentiment, anything is possible;
without it, nothing is possible.
I believe he continued on to say: No
statute has real force.
So that is good for us to remember,
that we have to go back to our town-
halls, as we all do, and sometimes some
of the most difficult parts of those
townhalls is telling friends that you
disagree with them, that there is an-
other side of the story.
So, with that, I thank the gentleman
from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL), my good
friend, for his reflections and his hopes
for this institution, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
If the gentleman from California is
going to start quoting Lincoln, I am
going to have to bring out some Frank-
lin.
I remember in the summer of 1787, as
folks were taking a break, it had been
hard and they were worried they
weren’t going to be able to reach a con-
clusion on language for our Constitu-
tion, Franklin admonished the mem-
bers there: Don’t go home and find
folks who agree with you, who are
going to tell you how right you are; go
and find folks who disagree with you
and listen closely to what it is they are
saying and what their concerns are
that we may come back together and
bridge a divide.
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question today, I am going to
offer an amendment to the rule, and
that amendment is going to try to do
exactly what I believe Members in this
institution want, and that is to get
back to some of the real problem-solv-
ing that goes on.
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert in the RECORD the text of
my amendment and any other extra-
neous material immediately prior to
the vote on the previous question.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia?
There was no objection.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, the
amendment is going to prioritize the
work that we all know America wants
us to do. I went through some of those
items earlier: work for the chronically
ill, for our seniors; folks struggling
with prescription medications; folks
who were concerned about congestion;
folks—go right on down the list of all
the priorities that we all hear from our
constituents on a regular basis.
If we defeat the previous question, it
will amend the rule to allow an oppor-
tunity to move forward on these pri-
ority issues. I don’t mean priority from
a Republican perspective; I don’t mean
priority from a Democrat perspective. I
mean priority from an American per-
spective.
I serve on the House Select Com-
mittee on the Modernization of Con-
gress here, Mr. Speaker. In fact, we
just had a hearing upstairs in the Rules
Committee, and it is a different dy-
namic.
Mr. DESAULNIER and I serve on a
committee of 13 people. There are no
time limits on discussion in our com-
mittee. That committee has a
majoritarian tilt—nine members in the
majority, four in the minority—so you
know where the vote is going to go.
But because it is a small committee,
because it allows for open debate, it
creates a relationship among the mem-
bers that isn’t possible, say, for the
Committee on Transportation and In-
frastructure, on which I sit, that has
more than 70 members on it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8157
October 16, 2019
b 1300
I have a chance to listen every day to
the opinions and the concerns of my
colleagues on the other side of the
aisle, as well as on my side of the aisle.
What we concluded, as we were work-
ing on scheduling issues in the Mod-
ernization Committee—because we
have so many young families here,
folks who are trying to balance their
obligations as a mother or a father
with their obligations as a Member of
Congress, and we all know how taxing
that can be.
And one of our witnesses, who has
vast experience trying to work on
House schedules, cautioned us against
believing that you could wave a sched-
uling wand and suddenly create a more
productive institution, that produc-
tivity comes from those relationships,
productivity comes from that sincere
effort to do better.
We are here on financial services
today. I cannot tell you that, in my
time on Capitol Hill, the Committee on
Financial Services is the committee I
would pick out as the single most col-
legial committee on Capitol Hill.
I think back to some of the discus-
sions that have happened over the
years there. It is a committee that
takes on difficult issues and often di-
vides along partisan lines.
We have two Members from Georgia
on the Financial Services Committee,
Mr. Speaker: a gentleman from the
metro Atlanta area (Mr. SCOTT) and a
gentleman from farther west in Geor-
gia (Mr. LOUDERMILK). One is a Repub-
lican. One is a Democrat.
And, odds are, when we get into the
real issues that are really going to
make a difference for families across
the district, they vote the same way.
Whenever I go and try to get into the
meat of a financial services issue, I can
go to what my friends, Mr. SCOTT and
Mr. LOUDERMILK, are saying. Again, op-
posite sides of the political spectrum,
but a shared goal of trying to serve the
men and women of Georgia as best they
can.
I confess, I don’t have high hopes we
are going to defeat the previous ques-
tion and amend the rule and get back
to focusing on what I would think are
those common goals that we share. But
I have been surprised before. And I
have been surprised in ways that dis-
appoint me, and I have been surprised
in ways that make me proud.
I will just say to my colleagues: If
you are thinking about busting out of
the box a little bit, if you are thinking
about should we do things the same
way we have always done them or
should we try something new, if you
are thinking about it is working great
the way it has been going or thinking
maybe we can improve on it a little
bit, just consider the Woodall amend-
ment to the rule today.
Let’s defeat the previous question;
let’s amend the rule; and then let’s see
if, perhaps, we can break out a new day
of productivity, not based on Repub-
licans and Democrats, but based on
Americans who are facing real prob-
lems back home and the real solutions
that we are very honored to be able to
work to provide.
Mr. Speaker, with that, I say to my
friend from California, I don’t have any
speakers here. I want to encourage my
friends to defeat that previous ques-
tion. In the absence of defeating the
previous question, Mr. Speaker, I
would ask folks to defeat the rule, give
us a chance to go back up to the Rules
Committee room with these 13 mem-
bers and try to craft something even
better than what we have here today.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my
friend as well. It is always a pleasure
to hear the gentleman’s words of wis-
dom.
I am reminded of a story that you
will hear if the docent has the time at
Monticello, when somebody asked Jef-
ferson when he first opened: Mr. Jeffer-
son, why do you have a bust of Mr.
Hamilton opposite you? You don’t
agree on anything with Hamilton.
Jefferson said: That is the point.
That is why it is there.
So, I appreciate the comments. I look
forward to further conversations up in
that room.
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like
to thank my colleagues—Congress-
woman AXNE, Congressman CASTEN,
and Chairwoman WATERS—for their
leadership on these commonsense bills
to protect American consumers and
workers, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the
rule and the previous question.
The material previously referred to
by Mr. WOODALL is as follows:
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 629
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing:
SEC. 3. Upon adoption of this resolution,
the Committees on the Judiciary, Ways and
Means, Financial Services, Oversight and
Reform, and Foreign Affairs and the Perma-
nent Select Committee on Intelligence shall
suspend pursuing matters referred to by the
Speaker in her announcement of September
24, 2019, until such time as bipartisan legisla-
tion to lower prescription drug prices and
limit patients’ out of pocket costs is signed

Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time, and
I move the previous question on the

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on ordering the previous
question.
The question was taken; and the

OPPOSING THE DECISION TO END
CERTAIN UNITED STATES EF-
FORTS TO PREVENT TURKISH
MILITARY OPERATIONS AGAINST
SYRIAN KURDISH FORCES IN
NORTHEAST SYRIA
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I move to
suspend the rules and pass the joint
resolution (H.J. Res. 77) opposing the
decision to end certain United States
efforts to prevent Turkish military op-
erations against Syrian Kurdish forces
in Northeast Syria.
The Clerk read the title of the joint
resolution.
The text of the joint resolution is as
follows:
H.J. RES. 77
Whereas thousands of Syrian fighters, in-
cluding Syrian Kurds, fought courageously
with the United States against the brutality
of ISIS throughout Syria, liberating nearly
one-third of Syrian territory from ISIS’ so-
called ‘‘caliphate.’’;
Whereas, on October 6, 2019, the White
House announced ‘‘Turkey will soon be mov-
ing forward with its long-planned operation
into Northern Syria’’ while the ‘‘United
States Armed Forces will not support or be
involved in the operation, and United States
forces . . . will no longer be in the imme-
diate area.’’;
Whereas, on October 6, 2019, the White
House announced ‘‘Turkey will now be re-
sponsible for all ISIS fighters in the area
captured over the past two years . . . .’’;
Whereas an October 10, 2019, White House
statement said, ‘‘This morning, Turkey, a
NATO member, invaded Syria. The United
States does not endorse this attack and has
made it clear to Turkey that this operation
is a bad idea.’’;
Whereas Turkey has historically threat-
ened, forcibly displaced, and killed Syrian
Kurds, including during military operations
in the Afrin District;
Whereas, on August 1, 2019, Special Envoy
James Jeffrey stated in reference to the Syr-
ian Kurds and Syrian Democratic Forces
(SDF), ‘‘We are committed to defeating ISIS
in northeast Syria. The SDF . . . is our part-
ner there. We are committed to those who
have fought with us not being attacked and
not being harmed by anyone. The President
made that clear publicly. That includes our
concerns about the Turks.’’;
Whereas in January 2019, Director of Na-
tional Intelligence Dan Coats stated in Con-
gressional testimony that ‘‘The conflicts in
Iraq and Syria have generated a large pool of
skilled and battle-hardened fighters who re-
main dispersed throughout the region . . .
and the group has returned to its guerilla-
warfare roots while continuing to plot at-
tacks and direct its supporters worldwide.
ISIS is intent on resurging.’’;
Whereas, during the counter-ISIS cam-
paign in Syria, the SDF captured thousands
of ISIS fighters, including foreign terrorist
fighters from around the world who pose
threats to our allies in the region;

Whereas in addition to ISIS fighters in de-
tention approximately 70,000 women and
children are currently held at the Al-Hol in-
ternally displaced persons camp and at other
camps in northeast Syria;
Whereas the Lead Inspector General for
Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inher-
ent Resolve stated in August 2019, ISIS is al-
ready ‘‘seeking to establish safe haven in al-
Hol’’ aiming to recruit individuals who are
‘‘susceptible to ISIS messaging, coercion,
and enticement.’’;
Whereas the SDF has warned the United
States and international community that a
Turkish incursion into Northeast Syria
would significantly decrease the SDF’s abil-
ity to combat ISIS and to continue providing
security and management for ISIS detainees
and their family members;
Whereas, on October 6, 2019, President
Trump conducted a call with President
Erdogan in which, according to the official
White House press release, they discussed
the upcoming Turkish incursion, and soon
after this call, a White House press release
announced the withdrawal of the United
States military from the immediate area,
which was completed within hours; and
Whereas an abrupt withdrawal of United
States military personnel from certain parts
of Northeast Syria is beneficial to adver-
saries of the United States government, in-
cluding Syria, Iran, and Russia: Now, there-
fore, be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled, That Congress—
(1) opposes the decision to end certain
United States efforts to prevent Turkish
military operations against Syrian Kurdish
forces in Northeast Syria;
(2) calls on Turkish President Erdogan to
immediately cease unilateral military action
in Northeast Syria and to respect existing
agreements relating to Syria;
(3) calls on the United States to continue
supporting Syrian Kurdish communities
through humanitarian support, including to
those displaced or otherwise affected by on-
going violence in Syria;
(4) calls on the United States to work to
ensure that the Turkish military acts with
restraint and respects existing agreements
relating to Syria; and
(5) calls on the White House to present a
clear and specific plan for the enduring de-
feat of ISIS.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
New York (Mr. ENGEL) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each
will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New York.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members may
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.J. Res.
77.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, since the beginning of
this Congress, when I became chair of
the Foreign Affairs Committee, I have
tried to work across the aisle to ad-
vance a bipartisan vision of what
American foreign policy should be,
what it can be, when we are at our
best. And that is a foreign policy root-
ed in our values—values like support
for human rights and human dignity, a
foreign policy that projects American
leadership as a force for good in the
world, a foreign policy that thrives on
the power of partnerships and alli-
ances.
I have worked with my friend from
Texas, the ranking member of the For-
eign Affairs Committee (Mr. MCCAUL)
to make sure that this vision is en-
shrined in the committee’s work and
that we do all we can to push the ad-
ministration toward this approach.
So, Mr. Speaker, for me, the last
week has been just devastating. A week
ago, President Trump had a phone call
with Turkey’s thuggish leader, Presi-
dent Erdogan.
Against the advice of national secu-
rity experts and military advisers, the
President gave Erdogan the green light
to charge into northern Syria,
unleashing what has become a brutal
campaign of violence against the Syr-
ian Kurds—our partners, the Syrian
Kurds, who courageously stood along-
side us for many, many months and
years in the fight against ISIS.
Mr. Speaker, that reckless and im-
pulsive decision was a betrayal of our
partners. It was a gift to Russia, a gift
to Iran, a gift to ISIS, and a gift to
Assad. And it was a blow to our na-
tional security.
Now, a week later, the same Kurdish
forces who fought with American Spe-
cial Forces to combat ISIS are now
fighting tooth and nail to survive Tur-
key’s slaughter. Russian and Syrian re-
gime forces have quickly filled the vac-
uum left by the United States.
President Trump’s decision has al-
lowed ISIS fighters in northern Syria
to escape from prison, paving the way
for a resurgence of the terrorist group.
It is a ‘‘Get Out of Jail Free’’ card, if
you remember Monopoly from the old
days.
And the humanitarian crisis is stag-
gering. Already, tens of thousands have
been displaced: families, women and
children. There are stories of gruesome
beheadings, torture, and abuse, all set
into motion, unfortunately, by the ac-
tions of the President of the United
States.
What kind of message does this send
to the world? How can America be
trusted to keep its word when we be-
tray one of our close partners, our
loyal and faithful partners, just throw
them out like an old shoe?
How can America be trusted to keep
its word when we make impulsive deci-
sions that have such an immediate,
catastrophic impact on so many thou-
sands of people?
Congress must speak out against this
disgrace.
The measure we are considering
today will send an unambiguous, bipar-
tisan, and, hopefully, bicameral rejec-
tion of Trump’s policy in Syria.
This measure calls on the White
House to develop a strong, clear strat-
egy on how to defeat ISIS now that
President Trump has sparked its resur-
gence. It expresses strong support for
Syrian Kurdish forces, recognizing
their commitment and sacrifices in the
fight against ISIS. And it calls on Tur-
key to immediately stop its military
action in Syria.
At President Trump’s hands, Amer-
ican leadership has been laid low and
American foreign policy has become
nothing more than a tool to advance
his own interests.
Today, we make clear that the Con-
gress is a coequal branch of govern-
ment and that we want nothing to do
with this disastrous policy.
So, Mr. Speaker, I say to our col-
leagues: It is on us. It is on us to up-
hold our country’s values, to strength-
en our national security, to defend
America’s standing in the world.
Mr. Speaker, I call on all Members,
on both sides of the aisle, to support
this resolution and make it clear where
we stand, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to first
begin with thanking Chairman ENGEL
for his bipartisan work to craft legisla-
tion in response to this week’s develop-
ments.
We often say in our committee that
politics stops at the water’s edge. And,
in this time of crisis, I am proud to
work with him to lead the most bipar-
tisan committee in the Congress.
Today may be a dark day, but it
would be much darker if we were di-
vided instead of standing united.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this
joint resolution. Simply put, the catas-
trophe that has unfolded in Syria over
the past 10 days is almost beyond
words.
I am concerned about the extreme,
long-term damage this has caused the
United States interests in the Middle
East and to the Syrian people, includ-
ing the Kurds.
The United States has worked for
years to prevent an armed conflict be-
tween our NATO ally Turkey and our
Syrian Kurdish partners. Our presence
in Syria was critical to countering and
defeating ISIS, and, until last week, it
helped prevent unnecessary bloodshed.
Working with the Syrian Democratic
Forces, the U.S. and our coalition part-
ners eliminated ISIS’ control of terri-
tory in Syria and were continuing to
fight ISIS insurgents.
I understand the administration’s le-
gitimate concerns about engaging our
U.S. forces in long-term military oper-
ations. I, too, want to wind down our
overseas conflicts and bring our troops
home. But, leaving northwest Syria
now does not resolve the problem that
brought us there in the first place; it
only creates more.
We need a residual force in place. The
consequences of this decision have al-
ready unfolded before our very eyes.
We have betrayed the trust of our
Kurdish partners who fought bravely
with us against ISIS to defeat and de-
stroy the caliphate, and they paid a
heavy price in thousands of lives lost.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8159
October 16, 2019
We must remember that Turkey’s of-
fensive affects not only Kurds but also
the people of northeastern Syria. So
far, dozens of civilians have been killed
and over 160,000 people have been dis-
placed.
Islamic State prisoners, Jihadists
and affiliates, are already breaking
free, reversing our hard-fought gains to
defeat these dangerous terrorists.
And, now, our Syrian Kurdish part-
ners have struck a deal with the Syrian
regime. This gives Assad and his Rus-
sian and Iranian backers more terri-
tory and opportunity to advance their
destabilizing agendas, including their
war on the Syrian people.
b 1315
My colleague ELIOT ENGEL and I
drafted this resolution to show that we
do not support this decision by the ad-
ministration and to call on Turkey to
end this destructive campaign in Syria.
We urge the United States to support
the affected communities of northeast
Syria, including the Kurds. We call
upon the administration to support our
Kurdish partners and stand with them
just like they have stood with us for so
long.
Given the grave implications that an
ISIS resurgence would have for our
homeland security, we call on the ad-
ministration to provide an updated
counter-ISIS strategy.
I do support the administration’s de-
cision to impose sanctions on key
Turkish officials and make clear that
there are more consequences for con-
tinuing this invasion. But more pres-
sure is needed.
Congress is only just beginning its
work to repair the damage this deci-
sion has caused. Chairman ENGEL and I
are working together on a bipartisan
bill to sanction Turkey for as long as it
continues this destructive offensive. I
look forward to working with the
chairman to bring this bill to the floor
as soon as possible.
I urge all Members to support this
joint resolution.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Rhode
Island (Mr. CICILLINE), a valued mem-
ber of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the chairman for yielding.
I rise today with a heavy heart. Ten
days ago, President Trump sealed the
fate of our Kurdish partners in Syria
when he gave President Erdogan of
Turkey the green light to invade.
I believe this callous and reckless de-
cision will go down in history not only
for its disregard for human life but for
the strategic malpractice of placing
American troops in harm’s way, allow-
ing thousands of ISIS prisoners to go
free, and ceding influence over the re-
gion to Russia and the Assad regime. It
was truly an unbelievably dangerous
and stupid decision that undermines
our national security and diminishes
our moral authority in the world.
I am pleased that this resolution has
widespread bipartisan support. We need
to pass it and get it on the President’s
desk as quickly as possible.
But resolutions—and sanctions, when
they come—can’t bring Kurdish chil-
dren back to life. They can’t reclaim
our American military positions and
equipment seized by the Russians.
They can’t restore our credibility,
which has been squandered as we have
betrayed the trust of our Kurdish al-
lies.
I am sickened by this administra-
tion’s actions. We need to do every-
thing we can, as a Congress, to make
this right.
I urge my colleagues to support this
bipartisan resolution. I thank Mr.
MCCAUL and Mr. ENGEL for working to-
gether, in a bipartisan way, to send a
very strong message that the Congress
of the United States does not support
this horrific decision that betrayed our
allies and undermines American lead-
ership in the world.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. HURD).
Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I
thank my colleague for yielding.
I am proud to rise today in support of
this bipartisan resolution that opposes
this disastrous decision to remove U.S.
Forces from northern Syria and aban-
don our allies, the Kurds, to a Turkish
invasion.
Since 2014, the U.S. and our allies in
the global coalition to defeat ISIS have
fought side by side with the Kurds to
end the caliphate and degrade the
threat of terrorism to our homeland.
Today, ISIS is beaten, but it is not
broken. They remain a threat that re-
quires continued engagement by both
the United States and our partners.
Just as the Kurds had our backs
against ISIS, we need to have theirs.
Instead, we are abandoning not just the
Kurds but also our coalition allies in
Syria. We are eroding all the progress
we have made. We are showing our
friends and our enemies that a partner-
ship with America means nothing.
We are providing ISIS with the op-
portunity to reemerge and once again
threaten the United States. We are al-
lowing Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir
Putin to play the role of humanitarian
saviors in Syria.
As an undercover CIA officer, I
chased terrorists around the globe and
saw firsthand the threats facing our
Nation from the Middle East. One of
the things I learned when I was in the
CIA was to be nice with nice guys and
tough with tough guys, not the other
way around.
Because of this decision, and all the
actions and inactions that led up to
this decision, we have let our friends
down; we have hurt our national secu-
rity; and we have ceded leadership in
the region to Russia and Iran.
I hope we can change our course, but
I fear it may be too late.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. MOULTON).
Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, right
now, with President Trump’s permis-
sion, Turkey is slaughtering our Kurd-
ish allies, the only people who stand
between us and ISIS, men and women
who have died by the thousands to pro-
tect Americans from terrorism, the
families of our American constituents,
like Seyhmus Yuksekkaya from my
district.
As a result, Russian and Syrian
forces are taking our positions next to
them. ISIS prisoners are escaping, and,
Mr. Speaker, the crisis has only just
begun.
We must act today because the Presi-
dent has taken the side of dictators
and butchers. The President has never
put his life on the line for our country,
like our Special Forces soldiers who
have been fighting terrorists in Syria,
whom he mocked earlier today by say-
ing they are shooting each other.
Perhaps if he had not dodged the
draft by lying about his feet, sending
another American in his place to Viet-
nam, he would know something that
all veterans know well, that there are
a lot of ways you can fail in battle.
You can fail physically. You can fail to
summon the mental courage. You can
have a bad strategy or bad tactics. But
nothing is worse, nothing is more evil,
than betrayal.
Yet, betrayal is exactly what this
President has done. It sends exactly
the wrong message to our allies, to our
troops, and to our enemies.
Our Commander in Chief should lead
with American values. He should lead
by the idea that there is no better
friend and no worse enemy than the
United States of America.
Today’s vote is necessary because
there has been no worse enemy to the
Kurds and no better friend to our en-
emies than this President.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4
minutes to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. HILL).
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I
thank my friend from Texas (Mr.
MCCAUL) and my friend from New York
(Mr. ENGEL) for their leadership on this
issue and the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee.
Mr. Speaker, let me be clear: I did
not support the failed Obama-Kerry
policy in Syria. During 2017 and 2018, I
was proud to see President Trump hold
Assad accountable for his use of chem-
ical weapons.
However, I have not supported the
United States disengaging from Syria
without a strategy since such was first
proposed by the President in December.
So I rise in disappointment today
over this policy change and Turkey’s
violations of all of its ‘‘promises.’’
A small group of American Forces in
northeast Syria advising and assisting
local forces in order to prevent insta-
bility from coming to power does not
constitute an ‘‘endless war.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8160 October 16, 2019
Despite being in NATO, Turkey is
not acting as an ally. By our actions in
this House today, Turkey will pay a
steep price for its provocation.
I have been told by experts with con-
tacts on the ground that American
lives are at risk directly because of
Turkish actions. U.S. Forces have been
shelled by Turkish artillery. Our NATO
ally since 1952, Turkey, which we al-
lowed to conduct this mission, has
thanked us by shelling American posi-
tions.
What a sad day for the Atlantic alli-
ance that has shouldered so many bur-
dens and shared so much loss in men
and treasure.
Syrian Kurds also announced that
they had come to an agreement with
the Assad regime’s forces to help
against the Turkish invasion, which
further entrenches Russia, Mr. Speak-
er, in this conflict. So now Assad and
his Russian backers will bring their
bloodbath over the Euphrates.
We also put all the gains we have
made against Daesh at risk of reversal.
This all could have been avoided. Mr.
Speaker, when critical American lead-
ership disengages, America’s global ad-
versaries fill the void.
Turkey must cease its military inva-
sion of Syria. The United States must
support the Kurdish communities that
have been our allies against ISIS. And
the White House must present a clear
and specific plan for ensuring the de-
feat of ISIS and border integrity with
Turkey.
I urge all of my colleagues to support
the passage of this important legisla-
tion.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. CASTRO), the vice chair of the For-
eign Affairs Committee.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
we are in the midst of a foreign policy
disaster that will be a stain on the con-
science of our Nation for many years to
come. The situation in Syria is costing
lives as we speak.
Until recently, our strategy to defeat
ISIS by, through, and with our allies
was working. Our small military pres-
ence in Syria was a sustainable force
that denied ISIS the ability to plan and
launch attacks from Syria or resurge
back into Iraq.
The President’s impulsive decision to
leave Syria without any deliberation
has ignited a conflict in one of the
most volatile regions on Earth. This
administration has managed to turn
our Middle East policy on its head in a
week’s time.
Turkey is slaughtering the Kurdish
forces that have fought and died on our
behalf in the fight against ISIS. In our
place, Syria and Russia have quickly
filled the void of American leadership.
We have betrayed our allies. This is
not a foreign policy that displays
America’s core values. It is a shameful
choice that will cause irreparable dam-
age to American interests and alliances
around the world.
I believe this joint resolution is what
we need in this moment to combat this
President’s worst instincts. The joint
resolution will rebuke the White House
and attempt to rebalance the situation
in Syria. I urge all of my colleagues,
Republican and Democrat, to support
it.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. REED).
Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
ranking member and the chairman for
their work on this proposed resolution.
But I want to remind my colleagues
that one of the problems that we face
in Turkey and Syria today is the fail-
ure of congressional leadership to ad-
dress this issue.
When I stood on this very floor dur-
ing the Obama administration and the
question of Syria came up, I remember
many of my colleagues agreeing with
me that we should not be in Syria with
boots on the ground, risking our most
precious assets of our young men and
women, without a clear Authorization
for Use of Military Force and congres-
sional approval of a resolution to do so.
We failed in the leadership here in
this body. That is why, as we go
through this resolution, I understand
the Turkish sanctions. I understand.
But make no mistake about it, by vot-
ing ‘‘yes’’ on this resolution, you are
authorizing the use of military force of
our men and women on Syrian soil.
If force needs to be redeployed to this
area, I do not want to hear from any
Member of this Chamber, nor the Sen-
ate, that we have not authorized our
men and women to be there.
It is time for us to set aside political
cowardice because we cannot make the
hard choices of approving a military
force resolution. We should join and
unite—the House, the Senate, and the
White House—in one congressional dec-
laration that we, if we put our men and
women in harm’s way, stand by it and
stand by the Commander in Chief in re-
gard to that request.
b 1330
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. CROW).
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I want to
thank the distinguished chair and
ranking member of the Foreign Affairs
Committee, Mr. ENGEL and Mr.
MCCAUL, for their leadership in
crafting this joint resolution con-
demning the administration’s decision
to withdraw and abandon our Kurdish
allies in Syria and leave them to an un-
lawful assault by Turkish forces.
As a combat veteran, I know first-
hand the strength of our Nation is tied
to our partnerships and alliances
around the globe. During my three de-
ployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, I
counted on our local partners for the
safety of our soldiers. And those part-
ners depended on the U.S. commitment
to them. That relationship forged in a
combat zone is built on trust and the
belief that our word is our bond.
The administration’s reckless deci-
sion to withdraw U.S. forces has under-
mined the value of our commitment,
not only to our Kurdish allies, who are
now isolated in fighting enemies on all
sides, but also our other allies around
the world. The message that we are
sending is that the American hand-
shake doesn’t matter. Our withdrawal
is an abdication of our moral responsi-
bility to the Kurds and undermines the
belief that America is a resolute part-
ner. It has also led to our adversaries
like Russia, Iran, the Assad regime,
and ISIS exerting greater influence in
the region.
Let me be clear, the President’s deci-
sion makes us less safe and further iso-
lates us from the very allies from
whom we have drawn so much
strength. The President must imme-
diately reverse his decision to with-
draw U.S. personnel from Syria, recom-
mit to our Kurdish allies, and take a
firm stance against any further aggres-
sion by Turkey against the Kurdish
people.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Florida
(Mr. GAETZ).
Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, if Turkey
is not acting like a NATO ally, perhaps
the sensible solution is to remove Tur-
key from NATO, rather than keeping
the United States inserted in Syria,
presumably forever. This is why I op-
pose this resolution.
I have heard my colleagues say we
should not leave Syria without a strat-
egy. Perhaps it is equally logical that
we should not stay in Syria without a
strategy, because in Syria we have tens
of Americans stuck between armies of
tens of thousands who have been fight-
ing each other for hundreds of years
and who will likely be fighting each
other hundreds of years from now.
Our mission to deprive ISIS of caliph-
ate land has largely been accomplished
with the help of the Kurds and with
over $9 billion being paid to the Kurds.
The Kurds have been fighting bravely
where they live, but they have been
trained, funded, and equipped by the
United States. And we cannot accept
the proposition that if we support a
group of people because our interests
align in one case that this somehow
morally binds our country to every
conflict that they have past, present,
or future; to do this would constrain
the utility of America’s future alli-
ances, not strengthen them.
The blood of America’s patriots is
among our Nation’s most sacred cur-
rency, and it must be spent only when
absolutely vital to protect American
interests. We are not the world’s police
force. We are not the world’s piggy
bank. I support an America first for-
eign policy, and I oppose this resolu-
tion.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I now yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. SHERMAN), the chairman of
the Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific,
and Nonproliferation, a very senior and
valued member of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee.
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
support of the resolution, and I rise in

opposition to the recent decision of the

We had a situation in Syria that was
stable. We had a modest deployment of
American troops. We were successful in
limiting American casualties to a very
low number. We had defeated the ca-
liphate. Our friends, the Kurds, who
had incurred most of the deaths by the
many thousands necessary to destroy
the ISIS caliphate, were safe. In other
words, the situation was stable and fa-
vorable to the United States.
Now we have taken an action in
which America is humiliated, the
Kurds are subject to slaughter, our
word means less in the world, and ISIS
stands to be revitalized. This is such an
obvious mistake. It is hard to find any-
one with any knowledge of foreign pol-
icy that regards it as anything other
than an unforced error. It is such a
great mistake that it makes you won-
der whether it was an intentional mis-
take designed to give Russia territory
in northeast Syria, for whatever reason
we might want to do that.
It is time to reevaluate our policies
toward Turkey. Since the 1940s, we
have safeguarded Turkey through our
membership in NATO and theirs. We
protected Turkey from subversion in
the 1940s and protected it from the So-
viet Union for decades. Recently, over
the last 20 years, we have had a policy
of obsequious humiliation in our ap-
proach to Turkey. We have kowtowed
to Ankara in failing to recognize the
Armenian genocide.
In doing so, we have taken a foreign
policy normally based on truth and
honor, and instead, humiliated our-
selves through silence and conceal-
ment. It is time to recognize the Arme-
nian genocide by an overwhelming vote
here in the House. It is time for us to
stop dishonor in our relationship with
Turkey.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois
(Mr. SHIMKUS).
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, it is
great to come down here today and
talk on this issue. I have been a little
bit outspoken since the decision was
made by the executive branch, so it is
great to see the legislative branch take
a stand and talk about what this policy
decision has made. And I am good
friends with Chairman MCCAUL and, of
course, ELIOT ENGEL who is the chair-
man of the committee.
As someone who served for many
years in the military, and I am very in-
volved with the NATO Parliamentary
Assembly and our alliances—alliances
and values are important. Walking
away from friends is the sad indication
of policy that we don’t want to sup-
port, we don’t want to condone. Yes, we
want America to be great, but we are
also great because of our friends and
our allies.
Coalitions are not bad. Coalitions
strengthen our public policy around
the world. And our relationship with
the Kurds goes way back to the first
Gulf war and the protection of the
northern Iraqi Kurdish area protecting
the air space.
Talk to people in uniform who have
been protected by Kurdish fighters
throughout these 20 years of involve-
ment in Syria. We give them our word
that we will be with them. I liken it to
being in a foxhole with someone from
another country, and the attack is
coming. You don’t get out of the fox-
hole and go to the rear and leave your
ally in the foxhole to defend them-
selves.
We see what is going on. I think this
could have been predicted. It is unfor-
tunate. I don’t know how we get the
genie back in the bottle, but I am glad
we are getting a chance to make a
statement from Article I of the Con-
stitution to the legislative branch that
we think this policy has been wrong
and failed and we do it in a strong bi-
partisan matter.
So I thank both of you for bringing
this, and I look forward to voting
‘‘yes’’ on it.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Florida (Ms. FRANKEL).
Ms. FRANKEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
support of our Syrian Kurdish allies
who have lost thousands of men and
women in the fight against ISIS at the
behest of the United States of America.
And I join my colleagues on a bipar-
tisan basis to call on Turkey to end its
invasion of northern Syria. Giving Tur-
key the green light to go into this area
will go down in history as a moral and
strategic disaster.
There so many consequences, Mr.
Speaker. Our Kurdish friends were be-
trayed and slaughtered and are now
forced to align with Syrian forces
backed by Iran creating an even bigger
threat to our friend Israel. ISIS is now
unleashed, Russian troops filling our
vacuum, and our other allies wondering
if we can ever be trusted again.
The Trump administration’s weak
sanctions are like an arsonist calling
in the fire department. Mr. Speaker, we
must protect United States soldiers,
secure our nuclear weapons in Turkey,
provide humanitarian support to the
Kurds, and impose crippling sanctions
on Turkey until they end their Syrian
campaign, and most importantly, pur-
sue a diplomatic solution to end the
conflict.
I want to end by thanking Mr. ENGEL
and Ranking Member MCCAUL for their
bipartisan leadership. I urge adoption
of this resolution.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, in the years I have
served in this body, I have watched
Presidents of both parties make a lot
of tough foreign policy decisions; many
good, many bad, but I cannot think of
a foreign policy decision more reckless
and short-sighted than this one.
Through all the years that I have been
working on the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, frankly, I have never seen a
President do something that is as ag-
gravating and that should have never
been done as what the President did
last week.
You know, when the President an-
nounced that we were going to leave
several months ago, it forced the res-
ignation of the Defense Secretary, Mr.
Mattis at the time, who was so upset.
That was unprecedented in American
history. This is something that is un-
believable and could have been avoided.
Mr. Speaker, I now yield 1 minute to
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.
HOYER), the majority leader.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I love my
1 minute. I also love my glasses, so I
can read what I want to say here.
Thank you very much. I rushed up
from my office. I was on a conference
call. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for
keeping it open.
I want to thank Mr. MCCAUL for help-
ing to bring this to the floor.
Mr. Speaker, Americans, of course,
knew when President Trump took of-
fice that he was inexperienced in for-
eign policy and national security. That
doesn’t mean he didn’t have opinions,
he did. But he hasn’t been in the day-
to-day work. That was alarming. But
also from my view, alarming is his
penchant for putting his own self inter-
ests ahead of America’s interests and
America’s national security. That
troubles the world.
The disastrous consequences are be-
coming obvious to Americans more and
more each day as we watch thousands
of our Kurdish allies. And this is not an
issue without some complexity, I un-
derstand that, but our Kurdish allies
fleeing, ISIS gathering strength, and
Iran and Russia and Assad advantaged.
There has rightly been broad bipar-
tisan shock and condemnation that
President Trump would so recklessly
endanger America’s allies, permit the
release of thousands of violent ISIS ex-
tremists and give in to Vladimir
Putin’s aims in Syria.
In short, he just opened the door for
ISIS to reclaim some power.
Any terrorist attack they now take
part in will be as a direct result of this
action. President Trump has betrayed
the trust, in my opinion, of the Amer-
ican people. He has also betrayed
America’s friends.
The Kurdish forces in northern Syria
have been among America’s most reli-
able and effective local allies. It was
their blood and sacrifice that led, in
part, to us being significantly success-
ful against ISIS. It is their young men
and women in uniform who have been
guarding ISIS prisoners, who, if re-
leased, have vowed to resume attack-
ing Americans and destabilizing the
Middle East. And in that effort, we
may lose further American lives pre-
cious to us, precious to their families,
precious to our country.
Our Kurdish allies trusted us to have
their backs. Loyalty is a two-way
street. It took years to build them into
an effective fighting force, now Amer-
ica is turning its back and undoing

years of efforts and progress. How
shameful. How irresponsible.
The President said he took this ac-
tion because he had pledged to get
American troops out of the Middle
East.
b 1345
Ironically, he took out about 2,000, or
put them someplace else. And guess
what? He sent an additional 2,000
troops to the Middle East. Now, it is
Saudi Arabia, where ISIS is not, hope-
fully, doing much, at least where we
are sending the troops. But how ironic
it is to say that we are going to take
troops out of the Middle East, and at
the same time, we send more troops
into the Middle East.
America’s reputation as a world lead-
er depends on the bond of our word.
Can we be trusted, or are we simply re-
sponsive that day for that issue?
If we abandon our allies, we will have
none when we need them to stand with
us.
Not only has President Trump aban-
doned the Kurds, but he has also re-
fused to join with world leaders in con-
sidering the Turkish attack in the
United Nations.
Instead, he chose to stand with
Vladimir Putin and is doing his bidding
once again by handing large swaths of
Syria over to his control. He is moving
in as we speak.
Indeed, as the front page of The
Washington Post pointed out this
week, Russia is now the one country
that every country in the Middle East
talks to and trusts to be a mediator.
Is that an America that is great?
America has abandoned that role and
the power it brings.
President Trump has also chosen to
stand with Bashar al-Assad, as I said, a
tyrant who has gassed his own people
with chemical weapons, murdered hun-
dreds of thousands of innocent civil-
ians, and caused the extraordinary ref-
ugee challenge that the Europeans
have.
He has chosen to play into the hands
of the Iranian ayatollahs. The Presi-
dent says Iran is not our friend. He is
right. We played into their hands with
this action.
In summary, Mr. Speaker, the Presi-
dent’s actions empower ISIS, betray
our Kurdish allies, embolden Russia,
reward the Assad regime, benefit Iran,
and endanger Israel.
These developments were sadly pre-
dictable.
Experts like Brett McGurk and Sec-
retary Mattis said this is not the right
thing to do.
This is not a partisan issue. This is
about America. This is about our al-
lies. This is about international secu-
rity and stability.
From the moment the President
made clear he wanted to abandon
America’s strategic interests in Syria,
both McGurk and General Mattis, Sec-
retary Mattis, expressed their opposi-
tion.
These developments confirm the
worst fears of so many Americans from
both parties who have long questioned
this President’s wisdom or interest to
protect our country and keep it safe in
a dangerous world.
It is critical, Mr. Speaker, that this
House, the peoples’ House, make clear
to the world that President Trump’s
reckless actions do not carry the sup-
port of the American people. It is crit-
ical that we condemn Turkey’s incur-
sion as well, and to do so in a bipar-
tisan way.
That is what this legislation will do.
Mr. Speaker, I commend all of those
from the Foreign Affairs Committee
who brought this to the floor. I know it
was difficult for some, but it is the
right thing to do.
The House will do everything in its
power to reassure our allies and remind
our adversaries that America does not
cut and run, that we stand by our word,
hold true to our values, and stand with
our friends.
I hope they will hear us and under-
stand that this action by this President
must not mar the goodwill or erode the
steadfast principles upon which our
country has engaged with the world
throughout our history and surely
again in the future.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘yes.’’
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I have no
more speakers, and I yield myself the
balance of my time.
This is one of those rare moments in
Congress when we see both sides com-
ing together, exercising our Article I
constitutional responsibilities on for-
eign policy. I can’t think of a better
committee than this, the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee, to stand unified as a
Congress.
This is not just the House, Mr.
Speaker. This is a joint resolution with
the Senate. This is going to pass the
House and the Senate, sending a strong
message about our foreign policy.
I believe that we learn from history.
The National Archives has an inscrip-
tion that says, ‘‘What is past is pro-
logue.’’ You see, history repeats itself,
and we need to learn the lessons from
history.
I remember after we withdrew out of
Europe after World War I, it allowed
the forces of Nazi Germany and Adolf
Hitler to raise its ugly head, and it
took the Marshall Plan to finally put
an end to it.
Then as recently as 2011, in the pre-
vious administration, President Obama
pulled 10,000 troops out of Iraq. My side
of the aisle strongly objected to that
foreign policy decision, arguing that it
would create a wave of terrorism, and
we were right. ISIS reared its ugly
head, and the caliphate was formed.
Mr. Speaker, you and I served on the
Homeland Security Committee. In the
years 2015 to 2016, the terror threat was
frightening. My threat briefings were
frightening in the SCIF.
External operations being plotted out
of Iraq and Syria to kill Americans in
the United States, almost one per
month, we stopped 95 percent of those
threats. The 5 percent is what the
American people know about.
But I will tell you this—from that ex-
perience, have not we learned any-
thing?—that we need a residual force,
if anything, to protect the homeland
from terror threats.
Now we have over 10,000 ISIS in-coun-
try and over 70,000 family members
that are there as part of the insur-
gency. We had over 30,000 at the time of
the peak of the ISIS caliphate. And we
can’t go back.
I am concerned, Mr. Speaker, that
this move will embolden the Russians.
The Russians have already gone to our
military’s campsites and mocked us.
They are mocking the United States of
America. Iran is there, and ISIS is now
emboldened.
We need a residual force to protect
us, as we had in Iraq. We need that in
Syria, and, yes, we need that in Af-
ghanistan. We can wind down the num-
ber of troops, but we need that residual
force.
Mr. Speaker, I want to close by say-
ing that I will never forget talking to
Condoleezza Rice after she retired at
Stanford, and she said that one axiom
is true in foreign policy: Your allies
must trust you.
Our allies are questioning us right
now. We told them, ‘‘Trust us. We have
your back.’’
What is happening now, the Kurds
are being slaughtered as I speak in
northern Syria.
She also said another thing: Our al-
lies must trust us, and our enemies
must fear us.
That is my foreign policy. It is
Condoleezza Rice’s foreign policy. I
think it is a good foreign policy.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman
for working with me to stand up on
this very important issue.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from Texas
(Ms. JACKSON LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let
me thank the chairman and ranking
member for coming together.
I was on the floor earlier, and I held
up The New York Times that says:
‘‘Syrian Forces Rush Into U.S. Void,’’
and, ‘‘Battle Lines Shifting to the Ben-
efit of Iran, Russia and ISIS.’’
We worked very hard to get Turkey
into NATO and to respect it for its sec-
ular position and its embracing of the
ideals of democracy, but to now be the
cause of thousands fleeing out of vio-
lence and bombing, now being the
cause of ISIS supporters and families
escaping, now being the cause of ISIS
fighters escaping, and not listening to
any form of reconciliation to put Rus-
sia as the mainstay is absolutely unac-
ceptable.
I believe that these sanctions and
this rebuke and this resolution that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8163
October 16, 2019
has indicated it was wrong to green-
light the Turkish military incursion
into Syria’s Kurdish territory, express-
ing strong support for Syrian Kurdish
forces who were our allies, and calling
on Turkey to immediately cease mili-
tary action in northeast Syria is a
question of our national security.
I add that there should be a no-fly
zone. I know how challenging that
would be for Turkey not to be flying
over northern Syria.
It is important that we do what we
need to do to save the precious lives of
those children, some of whom have al-
ready died, and those who are fleeing
the violence.
Mr. Speaker, let us pass this resolu-
tion, H.J. Res. 77, but let us find a way
to bring some peace and stand down in
that region, and also to thank the
United States military, which should
not have been moved. I ask my col-
leagues to support H.J. Res. 77.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, in closing,
I yield myself as much time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned before,
in the years I have served in this body,
I have watched Presidents of both par-
ties make a lot of tough foreign policy
decisions, many good, many bad, but I
cannot think of a foreign policy deci-
sion more reckless and shortsighted
than this one that was made by Presi-
dent Trump.
The President of the United States,
as a result, has empowered ISIS; be-
trayed our loyal partners, the Kurds;
and jeopardized our national security.
Congress must condemn this loudly
and clearly. Today’s resolution sends a
resounding message to the White House
and the world: We reject President
Trump’s disgraceful failure in foreign
policy.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to
stand by our partners, stand by our
promises, stand by our values, and sup-
port this resolution.
Mr. Speaker, I commend my partner
on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr.
MCCAUL. It takes a lot of courage to do
what he did today, and I thank him for
it. That is why, as he and I both men-
tioned, we are proud that the Foreign
Affairs Committee is perhaps the most
bipartisan committee in Congress.
When we go abroad, partisanship
should stop at the water’s edge. We all,
Democrat and Republican, feel out-
raged at what the President did. We all
feel that our allies need to be sup-
ported. That transcends any kind of
partisan politics.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of our col-
leagues to support this bipartisan
measure, and I yield back the balance
of my time.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support
this bipartisan legislation that will
make technical changes to the reau-
thorization of the Office of National
Drug Control Policy included in last
year’s SUPPORT Act.
As we all know, we are in the midst
of a substance use disorder epidemic
fueled by the proliferation of opioids,
exacerbated by synthetic opioids like
fentanyl, and increased use of
methamphetamines, among other
threats.
This year, Americans will lose close
to 70,000 friends and family and loved
ones due to drug overdoses. More
Americans are now dying annually due
to overdose than at the height of the
AIDS crisis or during the entire Viet-
nam war.
No community is unaffected by the
crisis. In my home of Orange County,
California, drug and alcohol overdose
deaths have increased by 82 percent
since 2000. Across our country, our con-
stituents are asking us to advance so-
lutions to address this epidemic.
Last year, Congress passed and Presi-
dent Trump signed the SUPPORT for
Patients and Communities Act, a wide-
ranging, bipartisan bill aimed at ad-
dressing treatment, prevention, recov-
ery, and enforcement.
The SUPPORT Act represents an im-
portant step in the right direction to
reverse the tide of overdose deaths. The
SUPPORT Act included provisions to
reauthorize and reform the Office of
National Drug Control Policy, a com-
ponent of the Executive Office of the
President.
ONDCP plays a critical role in over-
seeing the Federal Government’s drug
control efforts. However, there were
several technical issues in the SUP-
PORT Act that must be corrected to
ensure that the office can properly
carry out its duties as Congress in-
tended and improve the Federal Gov-
ernment’s response to this crisis.

The ONDCP Technical Corrections
Act of 2019 would ensure the integrity
of the performance measurement sys-
tem, help ONDCP hire the best people
to address the addiction crisis, and im-
prove the effectiveness of grant pro-

bating, and treating the effects of drug
proliferation throughout our Nation.
I thank the gentleman from North
Carolina (Mr. MEADOWS), my fellow
Member, for joining me in introducing
this bill and the committee staff on
both sides of the aisle for working dili-
gently to develop and advance it. I look
forward to the House of Representa-

DEAR CHAIRMAN CUMMINGS: I write con-
cerning H.R. 3889, the ‘‘ONDCP Technical
Corrections Act of 2019,’’ which was addition-
ally referred to the Committee on Energy
and Commerce.
In recognition of the desire to expedite
consideration of H.R. 3889, the Committee on
Energy and Commerce agrees to waive for-
mal consideration of the bill as to provisions
that fall within the Rule Xjurisdiction of the
Committee on Energy and Commerce. The
Committee takes this action with the mu-
tual understanding that we do not waive any
jurisdiction over the subject matter con-
tained in this or similar legislation, and that
the Committee will be appropriately con-
sulted and involved as this bill or similar
legislation moves forward so that we may
address any remaining issues within our ju-
risdiction. I also request that you support
my request to name members of the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce to any con-
ference committee to consider such provi-
sions.
Finally, I would appreciate the inclusion of
this letter into the Congressional Record
during floor consideration of H.R. 3889.
Sincerely,

Hon. FRANK PALLONE, Jr.,
Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN PALLONE: Thank you for
your letter regarding H.R. 3889, the ONDCP
Technical Corrections Act of 2019. As you
know, the bill was referred primarily to the
Committee on Oversight and Reform with an
additional referral to the Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce.
I thank you for allowing the Committee on
Energy and Commerce to be discharged from
further consideration of the bill to expedite
floor consideration. This discharge in no way
affects your jurisdiction over the subject
matter of the bill, and it will not serve as
precedent for future referrals. In addition,
should a conference on the bill be necessary,
I would support your request to have the
Committee on Energy and Commerce rep-
resented on the conference committee.
I would be pleased to include this letter
and any response in the Congressional
Record during floor consideration to memo-
rialize our understanding.
Sincerely,
ELIJAH E. CUMMINGS,
Chairman.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
3889, the ONDCP Technical Corrections
Act of 2019. Simply, this bill makes
technical amendments to a law we
passed last Congress.
We moved quickly last Congress to
reauthorize the Office of National Drug
Control Policy. The reauthorization
was drafted to reinvigorate the office
and give the Trump administration ad-
ditional authorities to address the
opioid crisis.
Last Congress, the Committee on
Oversight and Reform worked across
party lines on a policy solution. Presi-
dent Trump appointed Jim Carroll to
lead that office. The Senate confirmed
his nomination earlier this year.
Since then, Director Carroll has
twice testified before the Committee
on Oversight and Reform about the
good work the administration is doing
to combat the crisis. This bill will help
to further support this administra-
tion’s good work.
I want to congratulate the gentleman
from California (Mr. ROUDA) for his
good work on this bill, and I urge my
colleagues to support it.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
ROUDA) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3889, as
amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

clude extraneous materials on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1496 would amend
the former President’s Act of 1958 to
cap a former President’s annual pen-
sion at $200,000, indexed to inflation.
The bill also would provide an addi-
tional annual allowance for expenses
that would start at $200,000.
Under this bill, the annual allowance
would be reduced dollar for dollar in in-
stances in which a former President’s
adjusted gross income in a taxable year
exceeds $400,000.
Taxpayers should not have to pay for
a former President’s allowance if the
former President is making a com-
fortable living earning millions of dol-
lars a year, as many former Presidents
do.
This legislation would not affect any
funding for the security and protection
of former Presidents and their spouses.
This legislation would update the pen-
sion amount for surviving spouses of
former Presidents, which has been un-
changed since 1958, by increasing it
from $20,000 to $100,000.
Mr. Speaker, I believe this bill makes
fiscal sense and urge Members to sup-
port it, and I reserve the balance of my
time.

Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. HICE).
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I
thank my friend from Arizona for
yielding.
I rise in support of H.R. 1496, the
Presidential Allowance Modernization
Act of 2019.
As has already been mentioned, in
1958, Congress passed the Former Presi-
dents Act, and that was at a time pe-
riod where Presidents did not have the
same financial opportunities that they
have today.
Recent former Presidents have
earned millions of dollars after leaving
office from speaking fees, book deals,
and other endeavors. For example,
President Clinton earned more than
$100 million in speaking fees between
2001 and 2013. President George W. Bush
received $10 million for a book deal.
President Obama and the former First
Lady reportedly signed a joint book
deal worth over $65 million.
It is just a fact of the modern Presi-
dency that these financial opportuni-
ties are now available to former Presi-
dents.
Given these financial benefits, it is
no longer necessary to provide the
level of taxpayer-funded support that
was envisioned back in 1958.
So, H.R. 1496 is an important step to
saving taxpayer dollars by amending
the law to reflect the financial reali-
ties of the modern Presidency.
This bill reforms the pension amount
for former Presidents and surviving
spouses. This bill also changes the
amount and the way that additional
benefits to former Presidents are allot-
ted. Currently, former Presidents are

eligible for benefits paid through an-
nual appropriations for things like of-
fice space and leases, furniture and
supplies, staff salaries, and so forth.
This bill would cut the allowance for
those type of expenses to $200,000 to
each former President. This allowance
will further be reduced, dollar for dol-
lar, based on the former President’s in-
come over $400,000.
So, in this era of massive Federal
deficits, I believe it is important that
our former Presidents lead the Nation
by example in cutting unnecessary
spending.
I want to, again, assure my col-
leagues that this bill does not affect se-
curity in any way.
I want to thank Senator ERNST for a
companion bill in the Senate and, also,
Chairman CUMMINGS and my colleagues
on the other side for supporting this
bill.

Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from California (Mr.
CÁRDENAS), my fellow Representative.
Mr. CÁRDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I
thank Congressman ROUDA for this op-
portunity to speak on the floor.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to be a
Representative of the San Fernando
Valley in the United States House of
Representatives.
I rise today to honor two American
artists: the great Marilyn Monroe and
Ritchie Valens.
I offer these bills, H.R. 1252 and 1253,
today on the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives to name the post offices of
Van Nuys and Pacoima, California, in
their honor.
First, I offer H.R. 1252 in celebration
of the talented and legendary Marilyn
Monroe, who has roots in my district.
Marilyn Monroe was born in Los Ange-
les, California, grew up in Van Nuys,
and attended Van Nuys High School.
She grew up poor and bounced around
orphanages as a child.
Back then, the chances of a poor
woman like Marilyn Monroe becoming
a national success and musical legend
was nearly impossible, but she beat the
odds. Despite her turbulent childhood,
Marilyn Monroe found stability and joy
while living in Van Nuys, California.
Her hard work and perseverance led
her to become a timeless, internation-
ally recognized icon.
In a world where many believe
wealth, status, or name determine
one’s destiny, Marilyn Monroe’s story
defies the odds and inspires many oth-
ers to believe they, too, can achieve
very similar success.
Marilyn Monroe showed us that
dreaming big and working hard means
something in America. Marilyn Monroe
went off to become an artist and a
trailblazer, starring in her own movies
and setting records during her singing
career.
It is with great pride that I introduce
this bill to rename the Van Nuys Post
Office in celebration of the life and the
incredible history of Marilyn Monroe.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
1252, introduced by Representative
TONY CÁRDENAS. This bill names the
post office located in Van Nuys, Cali-
fornia, in honor of Marilyn Monroe.
Miss Monroe spent her formative
years in Van Nuys and attended the
high school in the area. The neighbor-
hood held a special place in her heart.
She has said it—Van Nuys—was a
source of joy, as it served as an escape
from her turbulent childhood, and it
was Van Nuys where she was discov-
ered at the local airport. From there,
Marilyn Monroe became one of Amer-
ica’s most famous and recognizable pop
icons.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this legislation, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
ROUDA) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1252.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8170 October 16, 2019
California, as the Ritchie Valens Post
Office Building.
Ritchie Valens was born and raised in
my home neighborhood of Pacoima and
attended San Fernando High School.
The rock and roll legend and father
of Chicano rock is celebrated today for
pioneering a music style derived from
the Chicano culture, and it has rever-
berated around the world.
He became a nationally renowned
rock musician at a time when very few
Latinos were recognized in American
rock music. Valens’ contributions in
rock include record-setting hits such as
‘‘La Bamba,’’ ‘‘Donna,’’ and ‘‘Come On,
Let’s Go.’’
In March of 2001, Ritchie Valens was
inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of
Fame. Ritchie Valens continues to in-
spire generations of musicians and is
an example of how, even when it seems
like there is no path to your dream,
you make your own way and build your
own path.
Ritchie Valens is an example of the
talent that exists in our community,
and his legacy is a source of pride for
our Pacoima community.
I am honored to offer H.R. 1253 in
celebration of the great Ritchie Valens’
life, a true trailblazer.
I can tell you, I have witnessed being
outside of the United States, for exam-
ple, when the song ‘‘La Bamba’’ comes
on, and every child, usually from the
age of 1, 5, 6, 7, or 8—they just can’t
help it—they just start to move, and
they recognize that beautiful music.
To be able to honor this man and his
family by naming a post office after
him is truly an opportunity that I ap-
preciate, and the entire community ap-
preciates as well.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
1253, introduced by Representative
TONY CÁRDENAS. This bill names the
post office located in Pacoima, Cali-
fornia, in honor of Ritchie Valens.
Valens was born in Pacoima. It was
there where he discovered his passion
for music. After his raw talent was no-
ticed by a producer at a performance,
his career took off.
In his short 17 years of life, Valens
recorded classic singles, as we heard, as
‘‘La Bamba,’’ ‘‘Donna,’’ and ‘‘Come On,
Let’s Go.’’
Tragically, he was killed in a plane
crash along with Buddy Holly and J.P.
Richardson, a day now referred to as
the day music died.
In 2001, Valens was inducted into the
Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Although
Valens may no longer be with us, his
music will endure for generations.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this bill, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
ROUDA) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1253.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I move to
suspend the rules and pass the bill
(H.R. 1833) to designate the facility of
the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 35 Tulip Avenue in Floral
Park, New York, as the ‘‘Lieutenant

ing’’.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 1833
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. LIEUTENANT MICHAEL R. DAVIDSON
POST OFFICE BUILDING.
(a) DESIGNATION.—The facility of the

may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
such time as she may consume to the
gentlewoman from New York (Miss
RICE).
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I rise today in support of my bill, H.R.
1833, which would rename a postal fa-
cility in Floral Park, New York, after
FDNY Lieutenant Michael R. David-
son, who tragically lost his life in the
line of duty a year and a half ago.
My district on Long Island has a long
and proud tradition of service in the
New York City Fire Department. For
generations, young men and women
from New York’s Fourth Congressional
District have joined the FDNY, fol-
lowing in the footsteps of their parents
and grandparents. They choose a life of
service and sacrifice and dedicate their
lives to protecting others.
Lieutenant Michael Davidson was a
part of that tradition. Lieutenant Da-
vidson joined the FDNY in May of 2003.
Assigned to Harlem Engine Company
69, Michael had the opportunity to
serve side by side with his father, Rob-
ert, who spent most of his 26-year ca-
reer at that same firehouse.
Michael was known among his col-
leagues for his bravery and lifesaving
actions, and he received four citations
for valor during his career.
As a ‘‘nozzle man,’’ he fought fires
from the front of the hose and was
often the first sent into burning build-
ings.
On March 22, 2018, Lieutenant David-
son was called to battle a five-alarm
fire on a movie set in Harlem. And, as
usual, Davidson was the point man on
the team that entered the building’s
basement to fight the blaze.
Conditions quickly became too dan-
gerous for the firefighters to with-
stand, and, though the unit was or-
dered to retreat, Lieutenant Davidson
was separated from his team in the
thick smoke. His colleagues later
found him unconscious, and he trag-
ically passed away the next day at Har-
lem Hospital.
Lieutenant Davidson’s death was a
devastating and unshakeable loss for
the FDNY; for Engine Company 69; for
Floral Park; but, most of all, for his
family and friends.
That is why this bill is not just about
honoring a fallen hero. It is also about
honoring a highly respected member of
our community; a beloved neighbor;
and, above all, a devoted husband to
his wife, Eileen, and a loving father of
four young children.
Renaming our post office in Floral
Park will ensure that Lieutenant
Davidson’s treasured memory is always
in our hearts and minds and that his
service and sacrifice are never forgot-
ten.
I strongly urge my colleagues to join
me in honoring a hero and supporting
H.R. 1833.

Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
1833, to name a post office located in
Floral Park, New York, in honor of
Lieutenant Michael R. Davidson.
Lieutenant Davidson honorably
served the New York City Fire Depart-
ment for 15 years. On March 22, 2018,
Lieutenant Davidson lost his life while
responding to a five-alarm fire. In dan-
gerous conditions, Lieutenant David-
son became separated from his unit.
When he was found later, he was un-
conscious. Lieutenant Davidson passed
away the very next day.
He was known for his bravery and his
devotion to his wife and four young
children. Our country owes a debt of
gratitude to first responders like Lieu-
tenant Davidson. I urge my colleagues
to support this bill.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time.

tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from New York (Mr.
DELGADO).
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor a true American hero, a
fallen soldier, Senior Chief Petty Offi-
cer Shannon Kent of Pine Plains, New
York, who was killed at the age of 35
on January 16 of this year by a suicide
bombing in Syria during her fifth com-
bat tour in the Middle East.
Senior Chief Kent, a Dutchess Coun-
ty native and Stissing Mountain High
School graduate, was a wife, the moth-
er of two beautiful children, and a can-
cer survivor. She spoke five languages,
including six dialects of Arabic, and de-
ployed with the Navy SEALs to Iraq
and Afghanistan on four different occa-
sions.
Senior Chief Kent gave the ultimate
sacrifice in service to our country and
will be remembered for her courage and
determination. She was the recipient of
the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, two
Joint Service Commendation Medals,
the Navy and Marine Corps Commenda-
tion Medal, and the Joint Service
Achievement Medal, to name a few.
In 2016, Senior Chief Kent survived
thyroid cancer and, in 2018, commis-
sioned for a special officer program to
earn a Ph.D. in clinical psychology at
the Uniformed Services University of
Health Sciences.
Because of a flawed DOD policy, she
was found medically unfit to pursue
this degree and, yet, somehow fit
enough to be deployed to Syria. Fol-
lowing this decision, Senior Chief Kent
sought a waiver from the Navy to over-
ride DOD’s finding and, again, was de-
nied.
Prior to her death, Senior Chief Kent
worked tirelessly to change the Navy
and DOD policies that resulted in her
fifth deployment. Due to her work, the
Navy has made positive changes to its
waiver policy, in Senior Chief Kent’s
honor. I remain hopeful the DOD will
follow in the Navy’s footsteps.
Today, I urge the House to pass H.R.
2151 to create a memorial for Senior
Chief Petty Officer Shannon Kent in
Dutchess County and name the post of-
fice at 7722 South Main Street in Pine
Plains, New York, the Senior Chief
Petty Officer Shannon M. Kent Post
Office.
Senior Chief Kent’s memory will live
on because she defined what true serv-
ice means. Honoring Senior Chief Kent
in this permanent way will serve as a
daily reminder of her heroism and sac-
rifice.
Senior Chief Kent is survived by her
husband, retired Chief Warrant Officer
Joseph Kent, and their two young sons.
My thoughts remain with her children,
husband, and the rest of her family and
friends.
I urge my colleagues to make this
bill law to honor her life and legacy.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
2151. This bill names a post office lo-
cated in Pine Plains, New York, in
honor of Senior Chief Petty Officer
Shannon M. Kent.
After high school, Petty Officer Kent
chose to serve her country, enlisting in
the Navy. She discovered a talent for
picking up new languages at the De-
fense Language Institute. After she
graduated, she joined the Navy’s
cryptologic warfare unit.
Between 2007 and 2012, Petty Officer
Kent was deployed to Iraq three times
and once to Afghanistan.
In 2018, she was deployed to Syria,
where she provided intelligence on
leaders of the Islamic State to the Na-
tional Security Agency.
On January 16 of this year, Petty Of-
ficer Kent was tragically killed in a
suicide bombing in Manbij, Syria. She
was only 35 years old, a mother of two
boys.
For her bravery, Petty Officer Kent
was the recipient of numerous honors,
including the Bronze Star, the Purple
Heart, and multiple commendation
medals. Her life was cut short, but her
service to our country will not be for-
gotten.
I urge my colleagues to support this
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time.

question is on the motion offered by

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8172 October 16, 2019
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand
before you today to memorialize the
remarkable life and legacy of Elizabeth
Buffum Chace, a leader of the aboli-
tionist and suffrage movements in
Rhode Island, by naming a post office
in her honor in the city of Central
Falls.
Born in 1806, Elizabeth Buffum Chace
was raised by Quaker parents out-
spoken about their opposition to slav-
ery, often harboring fugitive slaves in
their home seeking refuge in Rhode Is-
land. Elizabeth soon became an activist
herself, passing around petitions, orga-
nizing groups of abolitionists, and even
later opening her own home as a sta-
tion in the Underground Railroad.
Chace spent most of her life in
Smithfield, Rhode Island, and was
steadfast in her dedication to advanc-
ing women’s rights, prison reform, and
the abolitionist movement. She be-
came known as the Conscience of
Rhode Island for her passion for cre-
ating social change and her leadership
in the face of adversity.
During her later years, she settled
down with her husband in Valley Falls,
near the present-day city of Central
Falls.
She was committed to bettering the
lives of others, serving as president of
the Rhode Island Women’s Suffrage As-
sociation, and helped organize a Fe-
male Anti-Slavery Society in Massa-
chusetts. She also served on the La-
dies’ Board of Visitors to the Penal and
Correctional Institutions of the State,
which examined conditions in the
State prison.
Chace’s tireless, lifelong activism
embodies the best of Rhode Island’s
values and remains an inspiration for
progress still to come.
Elizabeth Buffum Chace continued
fighting for women’s rights and prison
reform in her later years. She eventu-
ally passed away on December 12, 1899,
and was buried in Providence, Rhode
Island. Her legacy was memorialized in
2002, when a bronze bust of Chace was
displayed at the Rhode Island State
House, the first woman to receive this
honor, in recognition of her extraor-
dinary accomplishments.
The dedication of the Central Falls
Post Office will serve to commemorate
her impact and advocacy for women,
children, and communities of color.
Her legacy lives on today through the
Elizabeth Buffum Chace Center, found-
ed in 1977 by the Warwick Junior
League Women’s Club to serve as a
shelter offering support and services
for women and children suffering from
domestic violence.
Rhode Island has been forever
changed by Elizabeth Buffum Chace
and her life’s work creating social
change. She was a legendary suffragist
and abolitionist in the 19th century,
and her importance to the State of
Rhode Island should be honored by
dedicating the Central Falls Post Of-
fice in her name.
I am proud to have had the oppor-
tunity to honor such an icon as Eliza-
beth Buffum Chace. I would like to ex-
tend my gratitude for the support from
my friend and colleague Congressman
JIM LANGEVIN and also to thank the
mayor of the city of Central Falls,
Mayor James Diossa, who generated
this idea, for his leadership.
I urge my colleagues to support this
legislation.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
2451, introduced by my friend, Rep-
resentative DAVID CICILLINE. This bill
names a post office located in Central
Falls, Rhode Island, in honor of Eliza-
beth Buffum Chace.
Ms. Chace was born to a Quaker fam-
ily in 1806 in Providence, Rhode Island.
She would spend her life as a civil
rights activist and eventually be
known as the Conscience of Rhode Is-
land.
She played a crucial role in the anti-
slavery movement. She opened her
home as a stop on the Underground
Railroad and was a key organizer for
the abolitionists.
Ms. Chace was also a fierce advocate
for women’s rights and served as the
president of the Rhode Island Women’s
Suffrage Association.
I urge my colleagues to support this
legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R.
3144, a bill to designate the United
States Postal Service Facility located
at 8520 Michigan Avenue in Whittier,
California, as the Jose Ramos Post Of-
fice Building.
Jose Guadalupe Ramos was born Sep-
tember 17, 1948, in East Los Angeles. He
enlisted in the Army in 1965, while he
was a sophomore at Garfield High
School.
Mr. Ramos served this country in
Vietnam as an Army combat medic,
often risking his own life caring for
others. Mr. Ramos was wounded in
Vietnam and was awarded the Purple
Heart.
Upon returning home, he was diag-
nosed with post-traumatic stress dis-
order, yet his passion and commitment
to our country and his fellow service-
members didn’t end.
Many of our veterans at the time
found themselves caught in and con-
fused by the crossfire of the public de-
bate over the war in Vietnam. At
times, some faced sharp criticism and
isolation. Mr. Ramos saw this and de-
cided that he was going to do some-
thing about it.
He dedicated his time delivering a
message of his experience and those of
his fellow veterans to all those who
would listen, traveling to universities,
schools, and prisons to carry this mes-
sage.
He undertook a grueling cross-coun-
try bicycle trek to draw attention to
and advocate for the long overdue
‘‘welcome home’’ that Vietnam vet-
erans never received.
b 1530
I was honored to work with Mr.
Ramos and the Welcome Home Viet-
nam Veterans organization that he
helped found. At his urging, I used the
resources of my office to advocate for a
national Welcome Home Vietnam Vet-
erans Day. In our years of working to-
gether in this cause, I had a true friend
and a partner in that effort. Mr.
Ramos’ passion inspired many.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8173
October 16, 2019
The memories of what he endured in
service to our country remained with
him throughout his life. At times, they
presented obstacles. However, he cher-
ished the time spent with grand-
children, his participation in religious
pilgrimages, and enjoying life’s simple
pleasures, like the sunrise and sunset
of each passing day.
We lost Jose Ramos in 2017 to pan-
creatic cancer, a loss not only for his
wife, Sylvia, his children, and grand-
children, his loss also left a hole in our
community in Whittier. Renaming the
Whittier Post Office in his honor is a
fitting tribute to Jose Ramos and a
very small token of gratitude from a
grateful nation for his service.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this bill, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
3144, introduced by Representative
LINDA SÁNCHEZ. This bill names a post
office located in Whittier, California,
in honor of Jose Ramos.
While still in high school, Jose
Ramos enlisted in the Army. He served
as a combat medic in Vietnam, during
which time he was wounded. For his
bravery and service, Mr. Ramos was
awarded the Purple Heart.
Later diagnosed with post-traumatic
stress disorder, Mr. Ramos dedicated
his life to supporting his fellow sol-
diers. Mr. Ramos understood the criti-
cism and isolation these veterans went
through, and he spent many years try-
ing to change the public’s perspective
of servicemembers.
In his later years, Mr. Ramos spoke
at universities and schools about his
experiences as a soldier. He was an un-
forgettable figure in his community.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this legislation, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by

The text of the bill is as follows:

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. RICHARD G. LUGAR POST OFFICE.
(a) DESIGNATION.—The facility of the
United States Postal Service located at 456

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. CARSON),
who happens to have his birthday
today. In an effort not to embarrass
any Members, we will not sing ‘‘Happy
Birthday’’ and simply yield to him to
make a few statements.
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in support of a bill to name a
U.S. Post Office in Indianapolis in
honor of Senator Richard Lugar, who
passed away earlier this year.
This bill is supported by the entire
Indiana delegation, and I believe it is a
wonderful start as we work to advance
his iconic legacy.
I was fortunate to know Senator
Lugar. He understood what it meant to
be a true public servant, and the values
he expertly displayed have inspired our
work in Congress.
Senator Lugar served as mayor of In-
dianapolis from 1968 to 1975, and he also
represented Indiana honorably in the
U.S. Senate from 1977 to 2013.
Senator Lugar was a brilliant schol-
ar, a brave member of our armed serv-
ices, and a dedicated public servant
who championed people and principle
over party.
Senator Lugar’s distinguished life,
Mr. Speaker, is a testament to the type
of leader that Indiana cultivates, and
his public service is an unquestionable
example of his deep commitment to
our great country.
A native Hoosier, he studied at
Denison University and at Oxford as a
Rhodes Scholar.
Following graduation, Senator Lugar
served in the United States Navy as an
intelligence officer.
Senator Lugar rose to prominence in
local politics, serving as the mayor of
the city of Indianapolis. But it was the
Senate where he became venerable, he
became known, and he had become the
leader that we all came to recognize.
Senator Lugar served as chairman of
the Senate Committee on Agriculture,
Nutrition, and Forestry, where he gar-
nered bipartisan support for great re-
forms in domestic policy.
Through his Senate tenure, he is per-
haps best remembered for his wide-
ranging impact on international af-
fairs.
Senator Lugar served for 34 years on
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, including two terms as chair.
After the collapse of the Soviet
Union, Mr. Speaker, Senator Lugar
helped reduce the threat of nuclear,
chemical, and biological weapons
through the passage and implementa-
tion of the Nunn-Lugar Program. This
bipartisan effort, Mr. Speaker, secured
and dismantled the former power’s
most deadly weapons, making our
world a safer place.
Senator Lugar also played a very im-
portant role in America’s enactment of
sanctions against the apartheid Gov-
ernment of South Africa and in the
United States’ recognition of a demo-
cratic government in the Philippines.
Senator Lugar contributed to the ex-
pansion of the NATO alliance; the im-
plementation of the United States
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief, PEPFAR, to end the global
AIDS epidemic; and the ratification of
antiterrorist treaties.
For all he accomplished, Mr. Speak-
er, Senator Lugar was awarded the
Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013
by President Barack Obama, our Na-
tion’s highest civilian honor.
In his final years, he served as presi-
dent of The Lugar Center, a nonprofit
organization focused on global food se-
curity, combating nuclear prolifera-
tion, enhancing foreign aid, and pro-
moting bipartisan governance.
Senator Lugar’s tireless efforts and
commitment to good governance
helped make the world a better and
safer place, and his commitment to bi-
partisanship won the respect of people
across the political spectrum, includ-
ing President Barack Obama.
In our very divided society, Mr.
Speaker, it is now more important
than ever that we reach across the
aisle and listen to each other’s con-
cerns the same way Senator Lugar did
throughout his many years of public
service.
All of us, regardless of our party’s af-
filiation, should draw inspiration from
Senator Lugar’s dedication to our
country, and all of us should strength-
en his legacy by pledging to advance
the Hoosier values and American val-
ues of bipartisanship and cooperation
that defined his life. Let this bill be the
first step to advance that goal. I urge
my colleagues to join us in supporting
this effort.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
3152. The bill names a post office lo-
cated in Indianapolis, Indiana, in honor
of former Senator Richard G. Lugar.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8174 October 16, 2019
Even before joining the Senate, Dick
Lugar dedicated himself to public serv-
ice. Senator Lugar worked as an intel-
ligence officer in the Navy, served on
the Indianapolis school board, and
spent 8 years as the mayor of Indianap-
olis.
In 1976, Senator Lugar was elected to
the United States Senate. Senator
Lugar became Indiana’s longest serving
Senator, serving 36 years until his re-
tirement in 2013.
While in office, Senator Lugar had a
wide range of accomplishments that
covered many policy areas. He twice
chaired the Senate Committee on Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry and
worked on bipartisan farm program re-
forms. Senator Lugar also spent 34
years on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee and twice served as chair.
Senator Lugar has received countless
awards, including the 2013 Presidential
Medal of Freedom and 47 honorary de-
grees.
I urge my colleagues to support this

the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 114 Mill Street in Hookstown,
Pennsylvania, as the ‘‘Staff Sergeant

amended.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

SECTION 1. STAFF SERGEANT DYLAN ELCHIN
POST OFFICE BUILDING.
(a) DESIGNATION.—The facility of the

Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
LAMB).
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
support of H.R. 3207, my bill to des-
ignate the facility of the United States
Postal Service located at 114 Mill
Street in Hookstown, Pennsylvania, as
the Staff Sergeant Dylan Elchin Post
Office Building.
Staff Sergeant Elchin served our
country valiantly in the United States
Air Force and was killed in action in
November of 2018. He was a special tac-
tics combat controller who was de-
ployed to Afghanistan in August of last
year as part of the U.S. Army Special
Operations Force Operational Detach-
ment-Alpha team.
Staff Sergeant Elchin’s role included
advising the ground force commander,
directing air support aircraft, and sup-
porting offensive combat operations.
Dylan repeatedly disregarded his per-
sonal safety to coordinate lifesaving
strikes and combat enemy fighters.
Dylan’s bravery was credited with sav-
ing the lives of many of his fellow sol-
diers and airmen.
At Staff Sergeant Elchin’s funeral
last year, we heard how, throughout all
of the difficult conditions that Staff
Sergeant Elchin experienced in Af-
ghanistan, he was always cheerful, al-
ways enthusiastic, and always someone
who inspired his fellow airmen no mat-
ter what. Mr. Speaker, I believe this is
because Staff Sergeant Elchin was liv-
ing his dream.
Staff Sergeant Elchin was born in
Brighton Township, Pennsylvania, and
grew up in Beaver County, and from
the earliest age he had an interest in
serving our country. Staff Sergeant
Elchin was eager to follow in the foot-
steps of his grandfather, who served 8
years, himself, in the United States
Army.
At the age of 14, Dylan immersed
himself in military history, especially
the Vietnam and Gulf wars, and this
passion fueled his desire to serve.
Dylan enlisted in the Air Force as a
special tactics combat controller, the
best of the best, immediately after
graduating from Hopewell High School
in 2012. Dylan was assigned to the 26th
Special Tactics Squadron at Cannon
Air Force Base in New Mexico. Dylan
was trained for combat operations, like
precision strike and personnel recov-
ery, and he was especially skilled in re-
connaissance, air traffic control, and
terminal attack control operations.
Staff Sergeant Elchin’s awards and
decorations include the Bronze Star
Medal, the Purple Heart, the Air Force
Commendation Medal, the NATO
Medal, and many others. Dylan was in-
credibly young to be honored in so
many ways, which is a testament to his
bravery, his skill, and his dedication to
his mission.
Mr. Speaker, if we do our job and we
pass this bill, the citizens of
Hookstown and all over Beaver County
will never forget Dylan’s name, and
they never should.
Dylan joins a long line of western
Pennsylvanians who gave what Lincoln
called the last full measure of devo-
tion. We are proud of Dylan; we thank
him for his service and his sacrifice; we
honor him; and we will never forget
him.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to
support H.R. 3207.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
3207. This bill names the post office lo-
cated in Hookstown, Pennsylvania, in
honor of Air Force Staff Sergeant
Dylan Elchin.
In 2012, shortly after high school,
Dylan enlisted as an Air Force special
tactics combat controller. Dylan was
assigned to the 26th Special Tactics
Squadron at Cannon Air Force Base in
New Mexico.
Dylan was deployed to Afghanistan
in August of 2018. Just a few months
later, he was killed by a roadside bomb.
Staff Sergeant Elchin received sev-
eral honors, including the Bronze Star,
Purple Heart, and Army Commenda-
tion with Valor. Today, we honor Staff
Sergeant Elchin’s life, bravery, and
sacrifice.
I urge my colleagues to support this
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time.

for yielding to me.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my
bill, H.R. 3329. This bill would rename
the post office in Montclair, California,
as the Paul Eaton Post Office Building.
The new name would be a tribute to
Paul Eaton, who served as Montclair’s
mayor for 23 years, making him the
longest-serving mayor in Montclair’s
history.
As a former mayor myself, I can tell
you that that is dedication. Being
mayor means being on the hook for
every pothole, every accident, and
every crisis that happens in your city.
It is not easy work, but Mayor Eaton
made it look so easy.
He uplifted the lives of every single
person that he encountered. He was a
fierce advocate for Montclair residents
and a pillar of the Inland Empire com-
munity.
His decades of public service earned
him the love, respect, and admiration
of everyone.
Mayor Eaton began his career at
Bethany Baptist Church and the On-
tario-Montclair School District. In
1970, he helped found Montclair’s Com-
munity Action Committee. There, he
earned a reputation as a fierce advo-
cate for Montclair’s residents.
Later, he was appointed to the
Montclair Planning Commission, where
he would serve only until he eventually
became a member of the Montclair
City Council in 1988. Following Mayor
Larry Rhinehart’s sudden departure,
Mayor Eaton was unanimously in-
stalled into the position of mayor by
his fellow city council members.
His many achievements include con-
struction of a youth center and a sen-
ior center, as well as a state-of-the-art
police facility, widening Central Ave-
nue on the I–10 freeway, making crit-
ical improvements to the Mission Bou-
levard and Holt corridors, and ensuring
future service to the Montclair Transit
Center for the Gold Line light-rail
service.
His record of service is truly an ex-
ample for the next generation. His fam-
ily continues to carry on the legacy, as
many of them also work in public serv-
ice.
Mayor Eaton passed away in July
2018.
He was survived by his wife, Ginger,
who became mayor after the passing of
Mayor Eaton. He was also survived by
four children, nine grandchildren, and
14 great-grandchildren. He was loved by
everyone.
Let us honor Mayor Eaton and his
legacy by passing this bill and renam-
ing the Montclair Post Office.
California, Mr. Speaker, has 53 Mem-
bers of Congress, and I am so proud to
have 52 of those members of the Cali-
fornia congressional delegation as co-
sponsors of this bill, including the dis-
tinguished Speaker of the House,
NANCY PELOSI, and the Republican mi-

Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on this

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I yield

Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join
my colleagues in consideration of H.R.
1972 to designate the facility of the
United States Postal Service located at
1100 West Kent Avenue in Missoula,
Montana, as the Jeannette Rankin
Post Office Building.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from Montana (Mr.
GIANFORTE), my friend.
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
my bill, H.R. 1972, to rename the post
office at 1100 West Kent Avenue in Mis-
soula as the Jeannette Rankin Post Of-
fice Building.
Born and raised in Montana,
Jeannette Rankin was a principled,
fearless leader who paved the way for
women in public service.
She was a fierce proponent for wom-
en’s suffrage. She led the successful
campaign to secure the right to vote
for women in Montana 6 years before
ratification of the 19th Amendment
that granted women the right to vote
throughout our country.
Her dedication to public service did
not stop with advocating for women’s
suffrage. Two years after Montana en-
franchised women, Montanans elected
Rankin to the U.S. Congress. She be-
came the first woman ever to serve in
this body.
Jeannette Rankin was a trailblazer
for women’s rights in our Nation. It is
an honor to recognize her and her last-
ing contributions to our country.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in honoring
Jeannette Rankin by renaming the
post office in her hometown of Mis-
soula, Montana, in her memory.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
ROUDA) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1972.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on

This is a great honor for me, Madam
Speaker, as I had an opportunity to
serve with Mayor Washburn as a newly
elected mayor. Not only was Jerry
Washburn the longest serving mayor in
Orem’s history, he was the type of
leader that is exactly what is needed
today among elected officials.
He knew that, as much as he loved
his city, it wasn’t enough for his city
to be successful; all of the surrounding
cities in the community must also be
successful. He knew it wasn’t enough
for him to be a great mayor; he needed
the other mayors to be great, as well.
His message was one of optimism, of
unity, and of working together as pub-
lic servants. He was humble and often

soft-spoken. But when he walked into a
room, everybody stopped to listen to
what Mayor Washburn would have to
say, and all of us were edified by his
message and knew that we were better
off.
He was a personal mentor to me. I
found myself often saying: What would
Jerry Washburn do? Inevitably, that
led me to a better decision.
In addition to being mayor, he served
as a board member for the Parks Coun-
cil of the Boy Scouts of America. He
started Washburn Motors in Orem with
his father and was dedicated to his
family, church, and community.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-

Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join
my colleagues in consideration of a bill
to designate the facility of the United
States Postal Service located at 1715
Linnerud Drive in Sun Prairie, Wis-
consin, as the Fire Captain Cory Barr
Post Office Building.
Captain Barr first volunteered with
the Sun Prairie Fire Department at the
age of 18, which earned him the distinc-
tion of being the youngest firefighter
in the department’s history.
On July 10, 2018, Captain Barr was a
first responder at the scene of a nat-
ural gas leak in downtown Sun Prairie.
As Captain Barr was shutting off serv-
ice and evacuating people nearby, an
explosion occurred, killing him. His he-
roic actions saved over 100 people.
Captain Barr was a beloved member
of the Sun Prairie community for 30
years. Beyond his contributions to the
fire department, he is remembered as
an outgoing and dedicated man. Cap-
tain Barr is survived by his wife of 6
years, Abby, and twin 3-year-old
daughters, Hailey and Aubrey.
Naming a post office after Captain
Barr is the least this country can do to
honor his sacrifice and the contribu-
tions he has made to his local commu-
nity.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
S. 1196, introduced by Senator TAMMY
BALDWIN. This bill names a post office
located in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, in
honor of Fire Captain Cory Barr.
Cory Barr knew from an early age
that he wanted to become a firefighter.
At 18, he volunteered with the Sun
Prairie Fire Department and became
the youngest firefighter in the depart-
ment’s history.
On July 10, 2018, Captain Barr re-
sponded to an explosion from a natural
gas leak. He, sadly, passed away while
working to save over 100 lives from the
fire.
Captain Barr is remembered for his
service, courage, and dedication to the
community. He continues to be an in-
spiration to young firefighters in Sun
Prairie and across the State of Wis-
consin.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. POCAN. Madam Speaker, on July 10,
2018, a natural gas leak in Sun Prairie, Wis-
consin resulted in an explosion that killed Fire
Captain Cory James Barr. Captain Barr was a
first responder on the scene of the explosion
and gave his life while working to save more
than one hundred people.
Captain Barr was a beloved member of the
Sun Prairie community for 30 years. He was
born on February 28, 1984 to parents Jack
and Janet Barr, and was a brother to siblings
Kim and Chad. He is survived by his wife,
Abby, and twin daughters, Hailey and Aubrey.
Captain Barr first volunteered with the Sun
Prairie Fire Department at age 18, earning him
the distinction of the youngest firefighter in the
department’s history. In addition to his con-
tributions to the fire department, Captain Barr
owned The Barr House in downtown Sun Prai-
rie and worked as a realtor. He is remem-
bered as an outgoing, dedicated man who
touched the lives of all his fellow community
members.
Hundreds of first responders attended a me-
morial service in July 2018 to celebrate Cap-
tain Barr’s life. Sun Prairie Fire Chief Chris-
topher Garrison spoke to his commitment to
the department and the community: ‘‘If Cory
could say something right now he would do
everything the same way all over again. No
resistance. No stepping back. He would face
the danger and do it all over again.’’ Other
speakers echoed Chief Garrison’s sentiments
and added that Captain Barr was a loving hus-
band and father to his wife and daughters.
The Sun Prairie Education Foundation has
honored Captain Barr with the Cory Barr Edu-
cation Memorial Fund. His classmates from
the Sun Prairie High School Class of 2002
created the Cory Barr Fire Academy Fund to
support the county’s firefighter training pro-
gram for high school students. Captain Barr’s
service to his community has now earned rec-
ognition from Congress by dedicating the Sun
Prairie Post Office in his memory. Captain
Barr’s legacy will live on as an inspiration to
young firefighters in Sun Prairie and across
Wisconsin.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.

MISSING AND MURDERED
INDIGENOUS WOMEN
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
CROW). Under the Speaker’s announced
policy of January 3, 2019, the gen-
tleman from Washington (Mr.
NEWHOUSE) is recognized for 60 minutes
as the designee of the minority leader.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
be given 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the topic
of my Special Order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Washington?
There was no objection.
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
this evening to lead a Special Order
alongside my colleagues from both
sides of the aisle to discuss a crisis af-
flicting our Nation. It is the crisis of
missing and murdered indigenous
women.
Each of the Members speaking to-
night represents different regions of
the United States and different native
communities that are all affected by
the disproportionate number of crimes
against Native American and Alaska
Native women.
My colleagues and I have introduced
several pieces of legislation, including
Savanna’s Act and the BADGES for Na-
tive Communities Act, in an attempt
to improve collaboration between law
enforcement agencies and empower
them to seriously work toward solving
many of these unsolved cases.
Over the next hour, I look forward to
hearing each of these Member’s unique
perspective on ways we can work to
solve this crisis and bring justice to
these women.
I have spoken on this topic a number
of times here on the floor, in the House
Judiciary Committee, and at home
with my constituents who have been
directly affected by this crisis.
While a lot that I might say here to-
night, Mr. Speaker, may sound like a
broken record—I apologize for that—I
cannot stress enough how important it
is that we use our voices as U.S. Rep-
resentatives to address a crisis of this
magnitude and offer solutions for these
women and their families and their
communities.
Native women throughout the coun-
try face a murder rate 10 times higher
than the national average, with 84 per-
cent experiencing some kind of vio-
lence in their lifetime.
In my home State of Washington, Na-
tive Americans make up about 2 per-
cent of the population, but a recent re-
port by the Washington State Patrol
shows that indigenous women account
for 7 percent of the State’s reported
missing women.
This crisis is one that affects commu-
nities in both highly populated, urban
areas, as well as rural districts, in dis-
tricts like the one I represent in cen-
tral Washington.
I have seen firsthand how these injus-
tices affect local communities, and I
have vowed to exercise my position in
Congress to help deliver justice for
these women.
My congressional district sits at the
epicenter of this crisis. There are cur-
rently over 100 open cases in Wash-
ington State, with 31 open cases on or
near the Yakama Indian Reservation in
central Washington alone. This in-
cludes seven new cases in just the past
5 years.
The number of open cases is alarm-
ing, but the truth is we don’t even have
accurate data to truly understand the
breadth of this problem. Due to a lack
of shared information, data, and re-
porting, there is no real way to know
exactly how many Native American
women have gone missing or whose
fate hangs in the balance of an un-
solved murder case.
b 1615
The complicated jurisdiction between
Federal, Tribal, and local law enforce-
ment causes serious problems through-
out many investigations, and far too
many Tribal law enforcement agencies
lack the resources and access to infor-
mation that would help solve missing
persons cases and murders.
This leaves the families and the com-
munities of these victims frustrated,
without answers, and begging for solu-
tions. And while we represent them in
the people’s House, it is the voices of
those who are directly affected that we
should be listening to.
Our communities in my district in
central Washington have not been si-
lent. Just this past Monday, the YWCA
in Yakima hosted their annual vigil for
the victims of domestic violence. This
year, the organization partnered with
the Yakama Nation to bring attention
to the missing and murdered indige-
nous women crisis and to honor those
who have lost their lives to domestic
violence.
Citizens of the Yakama Nation and
other local Tribes have hosted rallies
of support in large public forums to
raise awareness of the crisis and to de-
mand action.
A reporter by the name of Tammy
Ayer from the Yakima-Herald Republic
has done a truly excellent job of keep-
ing the public informed of these ongo-
ing efforts, diligently highlighting the
activism on the ground and providing
resources for families and friends of
missing Native women. The voice she
lends to the voiceless has and will con-
tinue to be a powerful agent for
change.
I hosted a roundtable earlier this
year with Tribal members, with law en-
forcement officers, Bureau of Indian
Affairs officials, and other local advo-
cates to learn directly from these pil-
lars of our local community about how
we can assist them in their efforts.
I have lived just outside of the
Yakama Nation Reservation my entire
life, Mr. Speaker, but hearing the
heartfelt testimonies of the families
and the loved ones of missing Native
women from just down the road from
me was truly an eye-opening experi-
ence, and a deeply heart-wrenching ex-
perience. I believe it is one that all
Members of Congress need to hear, and
that is why we are here tonight.
That is also why in June I sent let-
ters to the House Judiciary and the
Natural Resources Committees asking
them to hold field hearings in central
Washington on this matter. The voices
of communities impacted by this crisis
must be heard. My request was echoed
by numerous local Tribes, by advocacy
groups, and by women’s organizations
who have all sent their own letters to
the committees inviting Members to
come meet with them, listen to the
voices on the ground, and discuss solu-
tions for missing and murdered indige-
nous women.
The Yakama Nation has generously
offered to host the hearing, which
would provide Members with the oppor-
tunity to hear firsthand from both the
Tribes, law enforcement officers, and
families of these victims who are deal-
ing with this crisis every day, about
how we can best move forward.
Their testimony would help dem-
onstrate the impact this crisis is hav-
ing on our communities in central
Washington and in other regions
around the country.
Mr. Speaker, I hate to say it, but it
has been 4 months since these letters
were first delivered to the House Judi-
ciary and Natural Resources Commit-
tees, but we have received no response.
It has been nearly a month since I tes-
tified before the Judiciary Committee
to ask for committee action and a re-
sponse to my letter. Still, nothing.
Thankfully, the current administra-
tion has been actively pursuing our
local input. The Department of the In-
terior is conducting a series of round-
table events with Tribes and law en-
forcement agencies across the country,
most recently in Arizona and Alaska.
While the Department of the Interior
and the Bureau of Indian Affairs cer-
tainly have a role to play in imple-
menting these solutions for the women
and their loved ones, Congress must
also pay attention and we must do our
part to listen and then legislate.
The two legislative proposals I men-
tioned earlier, Savanna’s Act and the
BADGES for Native Communities Act,
would provide immediate assistance to
Tribes and law enforcement in address-
ing this crisis. As you will hear to-
night, Mr. Speaker, these bills have
strong bipartisan support.
I know my colleagues and I stand
ready to develop solutions that will
work for local Tribal communities and

law enforcement, and I look forward to
hearing from my friends and colleagues
from around the country over the next
hour to discuss the impact the crisis of
missing and murdered indigenous
women has had on their communities
and about what actions this body can
help take to stop it.
I yield to the gentleman from Mon-
tana (Mr. GIANFORTE), my good friend
who represents the great State of Mon-
tana, as well as the Northern Cheyenne
and Blackfeet Tribes. Montana is a
large State and with understaffed law
enforcement agencies, reporting an in-
vestigation of crimes against Native
American women can slip through the
cracks.
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Washington
for yielding. Mr. NEWHOUSE has been a
leader in responding to the crisis of
missing and murdered indigenous
women, and for that I thank him for
his leadership.
In late August, Kaysera Stops Pretty
Places who just turned 18, was sup-
posed to join her mother to see a rel-
ative in North Dakota. She didn’t
make it. She disappeared. No one could
reach her. Days later, her body was
found besides a woodpile in Hardin,
Montana. The circumstances sur-
rounding her disappearance and death
remain a mystery. Hers is one story of
far too many. This tragic epidemic
must end.
These are our sisters, our daughters,
and our granddaughters. Their cases
often do not receive the attention they
deserve. Their families deserve justice.
Over the past months, I have met with
Montanans in each of our 56 counties,
and in the eight recognized Tribal gov-
ernments. I have often heard of the
challenges faced to address this crisis.
We must do better.
When someone goes missing, time is
of the essence. Improving cooperation
amongst local, State, Tribal, and Fed-
eral Governments is critical. I heard
over and over of the challenges in
delays in performing background
checks for applicants to Tribal law en-
forcement.
In one recent visit, Tribal leadership
at one reservation shared with me that
only 4 of their 14 law enforcement posi-
tions were currently filled, preventing
them from effectively implementing
the law on the reservation.
The BADGES for Native Commu-
nities Act, which I cosponsor with the
gentleman from Washington, speeds up
that process with the Bureau of Indian
Affairs. The legislation also improves
information sharing and reporting be-
tween Federal and Tribal law enforce-
ment.
The BADGES for Native Commu-
nities Act also builds on Savanna’s
Act, which I also cosponsor with the
gentleman from Washington. Savan-
na’s Act addresses this epidemic by
issuing new guidelines for inves-
tigating cases of missing and murdered
indigenous women.
I urge the committees of jurisdiction
to consider the BADGES for Native
American Communities Act, and I urge
House leaders to bring up the bill for a
vote.
Finally, at a time when we should be
dedicating our time and resources to
this crisis, the Federal Government
shouldn’t stretch itself too thin. For 5
years, the FBI dedicated a full-time
agent to combating human trafficking.
The Bureau recently announced that it
would divide that agent’s time between
human trafficking and Indian Country.
In September, I urged the FBI Direc-
tor to dedicate a full-time agent to ad-
dressing human trafficking, and an-
other agent to fighting crime in Indian
Country. The FBI should allow each
full-time agent to dedicate his or her
time, attention, and resources solely to
his or her unique, pressing law enforce-
ment challenge. At this critical junc-
ture, now is not the time to be penny
wise and pound foolish.
There is more we must do for
Kaysera Stops Pretty Places and thou-
sands of missing indigenous women
across our country.
I thank Mr. NEWHOUSE and all of my
colleagues for their help in bringing
needed attention to this serious issue.
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I cer-
tainly appreciate Mr. GIANFORTE put-
ting a face to this very serious issue
that we are experiencing all over the
United States, and particularly in
Montana, and pointing out some of the
ways that this legislation could poten-
tially benefit our communities.
I thank the gentleman very much for
sharing tonight.
Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned earlier,
one of the pieces of legislation that my
colleagues and I have introduced this
Congress, is Savanna’s Act, named
after a young lady, Savanna LaFon-
taine-Greywind, who was a member of
the Spirit Lake Tribe and was trag-
ically murdered in August of 2017.
Earlier this year, I worked with a bi-
partisan group of colleagues to improve
this legislation from the previous
version of the bill that was introduced
in the 115th Congress. It does a lot of
things, but two things I want to point
out, it aims to develop guidelines and
best practices for law enforcement
agencies and encourages agencies to
enhance reporting and recordkeeping
for better coordination.
It also aims to improve communica-
tion between law enforcement and the
families of the loved ones of the vic-
tims, which is an issue that was
brought to my attention by the central
Washington families who, in some
cases, have waited for months just for
an update on their loved one’s case.
So it is with that background that I
want to yield to the gentlewoman from
California (Mrs. TORRES), my good
friend. I really appreciate her leader-
ship and her partnership in this effort
on bringing this issue forward and
bringing some good solutions forward
as we work to improve law enforce-
ment’s response in the cases of these
missing and murdered indigenous
women. I can’t say enough about the
contribution of Congresswoman NORMA
TORRES, and I would like her to share
some things from her perspective.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I thank Congressman
NEWHOUSE for organizing this Special
Order and for his leadership. I sincerely
hope that this will serve as a call to ac-
tion for all of us. Like the gentleman,
I was very disappointed that we could
not get Savanna’s Act across the 115th
Congress and signed into law.
Mr. Speaker, every single person in
this country, no matter their gender or
background, deserves to live in safety,
and every single victim deserves jus-
tice. But for Native Americans, and es-
pecially Native American women, that
has not been the case. Far from it.
There is a long history of violence
against Native Americans and exploi-
tation of Native American women. It is
a history that we don’t talk about
nearly enough. That is why, last week,
I introduced a bipartisan resolution to
support the creation of a new Federal
holiday, Indigenous Peoples’ Day, on
the day that is now called Columbus
Day.
Across the Americas, too many indig-
enous people are still living with the
legacy of colonialism and the violence
that came with it. Taking one day a
year to acknowledge that history and
to acknowledge the many contribu-
tions of Native Americans to this great
country, is the least that we can do,
but it isn’t enough.
As William Faulkner famously said:
‘‘The past is never dead. It’s not even
past.’’
And the reality is that today, Native
American women are being killed and
going missing at an alarming rate. Na-
tive American women are 10 times
more likely to be killed than the na-
tional average, and that is shameful.
What is worse is that we do not even
know how many Native American
women have gone missing. Criminals
prey on Native American women be-
cause they know that they can get
away with this crime. So Congress
must take action to address this crisis
and that is why we are here today.
In April, the House passed the Vio-
lence Against Women Act, which would
give Native American Tribes jurisdic-
tion over crimes of violence against
women. This is a significant step to
solving the problem, but the Senate
must act now to pass this critical legis-
lation.
In May, I introduced Savanna’s Act
to honor Savanna LaFontaine-
Greywind, a 22-year old pregnant mem-
ber of the Spirit Lake Tribe who was
tragically murdered in 2017.
I have worked with a group of Demo-
crats and Republicans from both Cham-
bers of Congress to make sure that we
incorporate input from a wide range of
stakeholders, including law enforce-
ment.

This bipartisan bill would create a
new set of guidelines for law enforce-
ment responding to cases of missing

and murdered indigenous women, and
it would give incentives for law en-
forcement to implement those guide-
lines. It would also improve informa-
tion-sharing and access to data so that
we have a clearer picture of the scale of
these horrific crimes.
This important legislation builds on
a previous version of Savanna’s Act,
which already passed the Senate last
year. It is awaiting action in the House
Judiciary Committee, and I am con-
fident that it will move forward soon.
Because of the efforts of Native
American women across the country,
we are close to passing Savanna’s Act
into law, but we cannot afford to con-
tinue waiting. More importantly, Na-
tive American women cannot afford it.
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for sharing
with us her experiences, and I thank
her for her leadership and being the
lead sponsor on Savanna’s Act, as well.
It is truly a pleasure to work with my
friend. I hope that, with her leadership,
we will be able to get this across the
finish line and get it to the President.
It is my honor now, Mr. Speaker, to
introduce someone who truly is in the
middle of much of this issue. He co-
sponsors Savanna’s Act, and he is a
leader on not only bringing solutions
to help solve this problem but probably
just as importantly, if not more impor-
tantly, he is also helping to shine a
bright light on an issue that, frankly,
many Americans just are not aware of.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the good gen-
tleman from North Dakota (Mr. ARM-
STRONG).
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, Sa-
vanna’s Act, which we have talked
about, is named in honor of Savanna
LaFontaine-Greywind, a 22-year-old
pregnant member of the Spirit Lake
Tribe who was murdered in my home
State of North Dakota in 2017. Her dis-
appearance and suspected murder not
only devastated the Spirit Lake Na-
tion, but it also devastated the commu-
nity of Fargo and was truly a horrible
issue felt by every member of my State
from one end to another.
For 8 days, her family, friends, and
the community searched for her, hop-
ing that she would be found alive. As
we all know, she was not. Thankfully,
her baby was found alive after sur-
viving the attack and literally being
cut from the womb.
Savanna’s murder brought to light
that data on missing and murdered in-
digenous people—women and girls in
particular—is scattered around govern-
ment agencies or it is completely non-
existent. Savanna’s Act attempts to
address this issue. It requires the Jus-
tice Department to develop protocols
to address missing and murdered Na-
tive Americans, including information-
sharing and training for law enforce-
ment.
We must do more to bring justice for
victims and prevent these crimes from
happening, and the reason is that the
statistics are staggering. On some res-
ervations, Indian women are murdered
at a rate of more than 10 times the na-
tional average. Native Americans are
two-and-a-half times as likely to expe-
rience violent crimes and two times
more likely to experience sexual as-
sault crimes. The number of unsolved
crimes on Native Americans on res-
ervations is significantly higher than
even the most crime-ridden cities we
have in the country.
More than four in five Native Amer-
ican women, around 84 percent, will ex-
perience some form of violence in their
lifetimes. The reasons and factors for
this are varied. We deal with poverty,
and we deal with rural communities, in
general. We deal with jurisdictional
fights between different organizations,
addiction, and a history of racial
abuse.
None of these things matter to the
people who are missing and to the fam-
ily members and the Tribal members
who are missing.
In Savanna Greywind’s case, the per-
petrators were found, and justice was
served, but that will never bring her
back.
I would be remiss if I didn’t mention
this. At the same time this was capti-
vating the entire State of North Da-
kota, Olivia Lone Bear went missing
from the Fort Berthold Indian Reserva-
tion in October 2017. Her body was
found almost an entire year later in
Lake Sakakawea on July 31, 2018. As of
today, that case has not been resolved.
Communication breakdowns from
one end to the other have caused frus-
tration. Her family members, the Trib-
al governments, and the State of North
Dakota have no resolution to this case.
I wish these were two isolated sto-
ries, but we all know they are not.
When we are here and working toward
things, I get it that we are in a polar-
ized environment, and we deal with
lots of different things, but this is ab-
solutely the purview of Congress. This
bill has had broad bipartisan and bi-
cameral support, and there is really no
excuse not to get Savanna’s Act
passed.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from
Washington for doing this today. I
thank Congresswoman TORRES and
Senator MURKOWSKI for authoring the
bill. I thank Senator CRAMER and Sen-
ator HOEVEN. I say thank you to former
Senator Heitkamp, who really did
champion this issue during her time in
the Senate.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
pass Savanna’s Act. It is simple. Some-
times we can do the right thing.
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, the
gentleman is right. This is a serious
issue. As the gentleman said, some-
thing this serious should be bipartisan,
and the good thing is that it is bipar-
tisan. People on both sides of the aisle
recognize the horrific nature of these
unsolved crimes and are wanting to do
something about it.
I am really heartened by the fact
that in this day and age, and in this
climate here in Washington, D.C., there
are some issues that we can rally
around together in a bipartisan fash-
ion.
I think that is a perfect segue into
introducing a friend of mine from the
Bipartisan Working Group, someone
who embodies the desire to find solu-
tions and to find common ground on
issues so that we can move forward.
This is a great example of the work
that we can accomplish when we put
our heads together.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to my good
friend from New Mexico (Ms. TORRES
SMALL).
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the 23
pueblos and Tribes in New Mexico. This
week, New Mexicans observed our first
Indigenous People’s Day, celebrating
the lengthy history and ongoing con-
tributions of Native American commu-
nities in New Mexico.
New Mexico’s past, present, and fu-
ture is tied to the vibrancy of its Na-
tive American sovereign governments.
One of the most serious threats facing
these communities is the crisis of mur-
dered and missing women. The murder
rate for Native American women is 10
times higher than the national aver-
age, and we have trouble even counting
these tragedies. Due to outdated data-
bases and insufficient coordination be-
tween law enforcement agencies, we
can’t count the number of Native
American women who go missing each
and every year.
This crisis demands a response. I am
proud and honored to join my col-
leagues—Congresswoman NORMA
TORRES, Congressman DAN NEWHOUSE,
and Congresswoman DEB HAALAND—in
cosponsoring H.R. 2733, Savanna’s Act.
Savanna’s Act improves Tribal access
to Federal databases, creates new
guidelines for responding to these
cases, and creates grant programs for
law enforcement agencies to improve
their practices.
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, it
truly is a great thing that we can come
together on an issue of such impor-
tance. I thank the gentlewoman for her
contributions and her sponsorship of
Savanna’s Act. Together, we can get
this done. I thank the gentlewoman
very much for coming tonight.
Mr. Speaker, it may not be obvious
to many of us, but some States are
taking action. Some specific States
have accomplished some things. In my
own State of Washington, I have to
mention the name of State Representa-
tive Gina Mosbrucker, who has been a
critical ally in addressing this crisis of
missing and murdered indigenous
women.
We have 29 federally recognized
Tribes in Washington State, so it is
critical that we have the State’s sup-
port to help address this crisis. Rep-
resentative Mosbrucker has spear-
headed legislation to improve the re-
porting of crimes on and off the res-
ervations and enhance coordination be-
tween the Washington State Patrol as
well as Tribal law enforcement.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8181
October 16, 2019
Earlier this year, the Washington
State Patrol released a report, as man-
dated by Representative Mosbrucker’s
legislation, outlining the number and
status of cases of missing and mur-
dered indigenous women throughout
the State. The report revealed that
there is much more work to be done in
order to empower law enforcement of
all jurisdictions—State, Federal, Trib-
al, and local—to accurately report and
investigate these crimes.
I know Washington State is not the
only State that is doing things. I wel-
come my friend, Representative DON
BACON from Nebraska, to the podium.
His State, for example, has one of the
highest rates of crime against Native
American women. Like Washington
State, Nebraska has been active in
tackling some of the shortcomings we
see in the coordination between Tribes
and law enforcement.
I thank my friend, Representative
BACON, for his leadership on this issue
and his help in getting this legislation
through. He has been a strong sup-
porter not only here but also in his
home State.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Nebraska (Mr. BACON).
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I want to
start out by recognizing Mr. NEWHOUSE
for his leadership on this issue, for edu-
cating us, and for galvanizing our Con-
gress to take action here. I also thank
my friend for the character and integ-
rity that he brings to our Chamber
every day. The gentleman is a bright
light right here in our Capitol.
Mr. Speaker, I also rise to address
the serious epidemic occurring in the
United States, and that is the dis-
appearance and senseless murders of
Native American women. Many Ameri-
cans are unaware of this epidemic, and
it must be brought to our attention.
According to the Native American
Women’s Nebraska Task Force, Ne-
braska, and particularly Omaha, has a
high number of missing and murdered
Native American women. Thirty-three
Native American women are listed as
missing in Nebraska. Omaha is ranked
third in the United States for having
the most unreported cases of missing
and murdered indigenous women. Al-
though the Nebraska State Patrol is
working with the Commission of Indian
Affairs and working as hard as they
can to collect and improve data report-
ing and helping with the investiga-
tions, there is just a lot more to do.
Unfortunately, this is not just an
issue in Nebraska. In 2016, 5,712 cases of
missing or murdered indigenous women
were reported, and only 116 are logged
by the Department of Justice in its
database. It is believed that many
cases go unreported, so that number is
expected to be much higher.
One of the ways we can address and
bring awareness to this very important
issue is to improve and strengthen the
relationship between Tribal and State
law enforcement agencies, enhance
missing persons reports, implement
diligent recordkeeping, and maintain
communication between law enforce-
ment and the families of the victims.
H.R. 2733, Savanna’s Act, does just
that. I am thankful to be a cosponsor
and glad to be on it. It is a worthy act
that we should pass.
We must also increase media cov-
erage to raise awareness and help lo-
cate missing women. In 1996, the
AMBER Alert system was established
when Dallas-Fort Worth broadcasters
teamed up with local police to develop
an early warning system to help find
missing children. This had a significant
impact. Since 1996, over 900 children
have been safely found. We need to
have a similar system that applies to
all Americans and target it here with
our Native American population.
What we have learned is that the Na-
tive American community lacks proper
resources to search for these women.
When police cases go dormant, our
families have taken it upon themselves
to search for their loved ones, but that
seldom works. It seldom yields results.
We need to provide resources to Tribal
law enforcement to help locate these
missing women, and that is what Sa-
vanna’s Act is designed to accomplish.
We say we will go to the ends of the
Earth to protect our families, our
friends, and our loved ones. That is
how our Native American brothers and
sisters feel about their lost loved ones
as well. When our country is threat-
ened by foreign countries, we take ac-
tion. When our country faces a medical
epidemic, we take action. When chil-
dren go missing, we take action, and
we know no boundaries. When our fel-
low Americans go missing, we take ac-
tion.
That is why I am urging my col-
leagues to support Savanna’s Act. We
can do better.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. NEWHOUSE
for yielding.
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank Mr. BACON very much for his
participation tonight and helping shed
light on this very important issue in
our Tribal communities around the
country.
I told you earlier, Mr. Speaker, that
I held a public meeting in Yakima ear-
lier this year. The reporter that I had
mentioned asked me a very pointed
question. This issue had been brought
to light in the early 1990s by one of my
predecessors who held this seat. That
person vowed to do something about
this, and here we are, 20-some years
later, almost 30 years later, and noth-
ing has been done.
She asked me: What is different
today?
I think the right answer to that, Mr.
Speaker, is that the difference, from
what I have seen, personally, is that
the men and women in our Tribal com-
munities are standing up. They are
saying: We are tired of this, and we are
just not going to take it anymore.
b 1645
They are making their voices heard
loud and clear and demanding action,
and this is something that we need to
deliver in order to help our Native
American communities around the
country.
It truly is a pleasure for me to yield
to the gentleman from South Dakota
(Mr. JOHNSON), who has been a true
leader on this issue, helping bring focus
to this issue so that we can find solu-
tions.
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the honorable gen-
tleman from Washington (Mr.
NEWHOUSE) for yielding.
I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to high-
light, to call attention to a crisis that
is facing our Tribal communities—real-
ly, our Tribal communities throughout
the country—and that is violence
against American Indian women.
More than 1.5 million American In-
dian women have experienced vio-
lence—ultimately, sexual violence—
during their lifetimes. The numbers are
staggering. They have experienced vio-
lence, murder, and kidnapping at
much, much higher rates than other
women—1.5 million women.
I know some of these women. Like
my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle, I have looked in their eyes. I
have heard their heart-wrenching sto-
ries of violence, of trauma. I have held
their hands. I have hugged them as,
through tears, they have described to
me events that I otherwise could not
imagine.
In just the last few years, we have
had 6,000 American Indian women, our
countrywomen, who have gone missing;
and just a few, just a handful of those
cases have been logged with the De-
partment of Justice. In that way, our
Federal Government is not doing
enough to combat this problem.
We know—every one of us here to-
night knows—that we can do better.
That is why I have felt so good about
how many of my colleagues today have
mentioned Savanna’s Act, which, clear-
ly, I am a cosponsor of, I am a sup-
porter of.
It is not a perfect bill. It does not do
enough, but it tries to highlight, it
tries to call attention to, it brings at-
tention to, it brings resources to the
experiences of those 1.5 million Amer-
ican Indian women who have faced this
violence.
No, Mr. Speaker, it is not a perfect
bill, but for those of us who have
looked those women in the eyes, for
those of us who have heard their sto-
ries, we know that it is an important
first step and one that this Congress
should take.
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank and appreciate the gentleman
from South Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON). I
thank him for his leadership in making
sure that people understand the grav-
ity of the situation that we face, so I
thank him very much.
Mr. Speaker, we have talked a lot
about both these bills, probably more,
though, about Savanna’s Act. Let me
talk a little bit about the BADGES for
Native Communities Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8182 October 16, 2019
It is a bill that strengthens Tribal
communities’ ability to investigate
crimes related to missing and mur-
dered indigenous women and better en-
force pubic safety.
BADGES stands for Bridging Agency
Gaps and Ensuring Safety for Native
communities. It gives Tribes and Trib-
al law enforcement agencies access to
Federal resources and databases so
that they can more effectively inves-
tigate open cases.
It will always provide resources for
Tribes to recruit and retain qualified
law enforcement personnel, which ad-
dresses an issue facing Native commu-
nities across the country.
Representative DEB HAALAND of New
Mexico and Representative TOM COLE,
the two lead sponsors of the BADGES
for Native Communities Act and co-
chairs of the House Native American
Caucus, could not be here with us this
evening, but I know their advocacy has
inspired many Members of Congress,
myself included, to work to bridge
those gaps on behalf of Native commu-
nities across the country.
This legislation, like Savanna’s Act,
has strong bipartisan support, and to-
night, I call upon the Committee on
the Judiciary to give this legislation a
hearing.
Mr. Speaker, another strong advo-
cate in the people’s House who fights
day in and day out on the behalf of
American Indian and Alaska Native
communities is the gentleman from
Alaska (Mr. YOUNG), dean of the House
and my friend.
Mr. Speaker, the good dean couldn’t
be with us here this evening, but he
will include a statement in the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD. In his statement,
Representative YOUNG speaks of the ex-
treme isolation and lack of law en-
forcement in remote Native commu-
nities and the concerning fact that Na-
tive communities lack full access to
criminal databases, undermining Trib-
al law enforcement in court systems.
I thank the gentleman from Alaska
(Mr. YOUNG), my friend, for his years of
leadership and for his original cospon-
sorship for both Savanna’s Act and the
BADGES for Native Communities Act.
Also, Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned in
my opening remarks, I have requested
a field hearing in central Washington
on Yakama Nation Reservation. I also
mentioned that several local Tribes
have echoed my request to both the
House Committee on the Judiciary and
House Committee on Natural Re-
sources.
I include the following letters in the
RECORD from the Yakama Nation, also
from The Confederated Tribes of the
Colville Reservation, from the YWCA,
from the Samish Indian Nation, from
the Puyallup Tribe, from the Missing
and Murdered Native Americans, from
the Washington State Women’s Com-
mission, and also from the
Muckleshoot Tribal Council.

DEAR CHAIRMAN NADLER AND GRIJALVA AND
RANKING MEMBERS COLLINS AND BISHOP: Shix
Patchway. On behalf of the Confederated
Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, I
am writing to in support of Savannah’s Act,
H.R. 2733 and to invite the House Committee
on the Judiciary and House Committee on
Natural Resources to conduct a field hearing
on the proposed legislation at the Yakama
Reservation.
We are truly to grateful to Representatives
Dan Newhouse, Norma Tones and Deb
Haaland for introducing Savanna’s Act. For
many years the Yakama Nation has made
formal requests to the Department of Justice
and Bureau of Indian Affairs to assistant
with locating missing persons, and solving
the unsolved homicide cases that have oc-
curred on and around the Yakama Reserva-
tion—with no response or action by the Gov-
ernmental Agencies.
The Yakama Nation Tribal Council has
formed a Special Committee for this very
important issue, The Yakama Nation Miss-
ing and Murdered Indigenous Women Com-
mittee. The Committee has been gathering
community input through informal and for-
mal processes, and working to implement ac-
tion items in response. On January 14, 2019,
the Committee hosted a meeting at the
Yakama Nation Legends Casino that gath-
ered input and shared actions item and was
well attended by many law enforcement
agencies and a representative from Governor
Jay Inlsee’s Office.
The Yakama Nation has supported the
Washington State Legislature’s work to ad-
dress the ongoing MMIW crisis, specifically
Washington State HB 2951 and SB 1713. As
the Yakama Nation testified in Olympia,
there needs to be a genuine response to the
reports of missing and murdered Native
women and girls across Tribal lands. Also,
all new legislation needs to be guided by a
clear strategic framework and principles to
move beyond the current conditions endan-
gering our lives and future generations of
Native women and girls.
The Yakama Nation is formally requesting
a field hearing on our Yakama Lands to ad-
dress the issues relating to the missing and
murdered women and peoples and the need
for Savanna’s Act, H.R. 2733. We would like
your Committees to have an opportunity to
hear firsthand from our community as well
as other impacted Tribes.
The Yakama Nation offers our assistance
to the Committees to facilitate true action
by the United States to address the crisis
facing Native communities nationwide.
Thank you for your time and consider-
ation. We look forward to your response.

DEAR CHAIRMEN NADLER AND GRIJALVA AND
RANKING MEMBERS COLLINS AND BISHOP: On
behalf of the Confederated Tribes of the
Colville Reservation (‘‘CCT’’), I am writing
to request that one or both of your commit-
tees hold a field hearing in Washington state
to examine issues relating to missing and
murdered Indian women and the need for en-
actment of Savanna’s Act, H.R. 2733.
The CCT worked with Rep. Dan Newhouse
when the House version of H.R. 2733 was
being developed. The CCT joins Rep.
Newhouse’s request that a field hearing be
held on the Yakama Nation Reservation as
explained in his June 6, 2019, letter to your
committees.
As explained in Rep. Newhouse’s letter, in-
formation on many open cases involving
missing and murdered Yakama Nation
women was recently made available by local
media. Previously, the CCT made personnel
from the Colville Tribal Police Department
available to assist the Yakama Nation in an
attempt to resolve cases of missing Yakama
women.
Thank you for your consideration of this
request. Please feel free to contact me di-
rectly with any questions.
Sincerely,
RODNEY CAWSTON,
Chairman.
YWCA,
Yakima, WA, June 18, 2019.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE NEWHOUSE: The
YWCA of Yakima calls on you and Congress
to take aggressive action to find answers and
protective solutions to the Missing and Mur-
dered Native Women in Yakima County and
throughout our country. We support your ef-
forts with Savanna’s Act. It’s time for the
violence against women to stop.
We request field hearings in Yakima Coun-
ty to learn more from our Yakama Tribal
members and others with information on
what is happening in Yakima County. We are
highly concerned about the level of violence
against women in our area.
For 110 years the YWCA of Yakima has
been providing services to women and chil-
dren in our community. Last year alone we
helped over 13,000 women, children, and men
who were experiencing domestic violence.
Our emergency shelter frequently helps Na-
tive women reclaim their lives and build new
futures for them and their children.
Thank you for leading an effort to bring
these issues forward. This is a crisis that
needs attention now. How many more women
will we allow to go missing or be murdered?
How many more children will grow up not
knowing where their mother is?
Sincerely,
CHERI KILTY,
Executive Director.

DEAR CHAIRMEN NADLER AND GRIJALVA AND
RANKING MEMBERS COLLINS AND BISHOP: I am
writing on behalf of the Samish Indian Na-
tion to share the importance to our people of
Savanna’s Act, introduced by Representa-
tives Dan Newhouse (R–WA), Norma Torres
(D–CA), and Deb Haaland (D–OK) to address
the devastating issue of Missing and Mur-
dered Indigenous Women (MMIW) that im-
pacts tribal communities here in Washington
and across the country. I am also writing to
underscore the importance of hearing di-
rectly from the tribal communities that
have been impacted by this epidemic.
Indigenous Women in Washington have es-
pecially been impacted by the crisis, with
currently 71 open cases statewide. Samish
Indian Nation has not escaped this impact,
as our late former Chairwoman lost her
daughter-in-law in a violent criminal act
over 30 years ago, and that case has even to
this day never been solved.
With this in mind, we ask you to hold a
field hearing in Central Washington to bring
together Tribal leaders, local and Tribal law
enforcement, and other community stake-
holders and hear firsthand accounts of the
MMIW crisis and how legislation like Savan-
na’s Act would help ensure justice for Native
Women and their families.
Thank you for your consideration and for
your leadership and advocacy for our Na-
tion’s Native Communities. I look forward to
welcoming you to Washington and to a col-
lective response to this crisis.
Sincerely,
THOMAS D. WOOTEN,
Chairman.

DEAR CHAIRMEN NADLER AND GRIJALVA AND
RANKING MEMBERS COLLINS AND BISHOP: I.am
writing on behalf of the Puyallup Tribe of In-
dians to share our collective support of Sa-
vanna’s Act, H.R. 2733 introduced by Rep-
resentatives Dan Newhouse (R–WA), Norma
Torres (D–CA), and Deb Haaland (D–OK). The
issue of missing and murdered Indigenous
Women (MMIW) has had devastating impacts
on tribal communities in Washington State
and across Indian Country. The Puyallup
Tribe has not been immune to this crisis as
we have several missing or murdered tribal
members whose cases remain unsolved.
The Urban Indian Health Institute reports
that Washington State ranks second in the
nation for missing and murdered indigenous
women. In data collected on urban areas, Se-
attle is number one, and Tacoma is number
two. With this data in mind we respectfully
and urgently stress the importance for the
committees to hear directly from the com-
munities hit the hardest as you discuss poli-
cies that will impact them the most.
We support Yakama Nation’s invitation to
the House Committee on the Judiciary and
House Committee on Natural Resources to
conduct a field hearing on the proposed leg-
islation. Hosting a field hearing in Central
Washington would be a meaningful oppor-
tunity to gather a diverse community of
Tribal leaders, law enforcement, and commu-
nity stakeholders and hear firsthand how
legislation like Savanna’s Act is needed to
assure justice for Native women and the
loved ones they’ve left behind.
Thank you for your consideration, and ad-
vocacy. We look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
DAVID Z. BEAN,
Chairman Puyallup Tribal Council.
MISSING AND MURDERED
NATIVE AMERICANS,

DEAR CHAIRMEN NADLER AND GRIJALVA AND
RANKING MEMBERS COLLINS AND BISHOP: I am
writing as an advocate for families of the
missing and murdered and as a family mem-
ber who has lost my mother and my cousin
to share our collective support of Savannah’s
Act, H.R. 2733. Please accept the invitation
to conduct a field hearing on the proposed
legislation. The crisis of Missing and Mur-
dered Indigenous Women (MMIW) is gaining
momentum across the nation with tragic
stories like Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind,
who was pregnant with her first child when
she was murdered in August 2017. Savanna’s
story is heartbreaking; and, tragically, there
are thousands of these stories across the
country. There are over 40 missing or mur-
dered women on the Yakama reservation,
each with its share of horrific details and
failed investigations.
Native American’s are the only race in our
country where no thorough data is collected,
thus there is no reliable way of knowing how
many Native Women go missing. Outdated
databases and a lack of coordination between
law enforcement agencies are creating a lit-
eral joke of ‘‘Who’s on First’’ where no one
wants to take jurisdiction. This bad joke
played out this winter in the death of 14 year
old Henny Scott. The family fought to get
law enforcement to take a missing report or
help find Henny wasting critical time. Henny
was found dead by a volunteer search party
on the Norther Cheyenne reservation in De-
cember 2018. This could have been prevented
and is unacceptable, and yet, Henny’s is just
one story.
The Urban Indian Health Institute reports
that Washington State ranks second in the
nation for missing and murdered indigenous
women. Seattle holds sadly is number one
and Tacoma is number two. I must respect-
fully and urgently request your committees
to hear directly from the communities hit
the hardest as you discuss policies that will
impact them the most.
Thank you for your consideration and for
your strong leadership and advocacy for our
nation’s Native communities. We look for-
ward to your response.
Sincerely,
CAROLYN DEFORD,

DEAR CHAIRS NADLER AND GRIJALVA AND
RANKING MEMBERS COLLINS AND BISHOP: I am
the Director of the Washington State Wom-
en’s Commission, a government agency fo-
cused on eliminating systemic barriers for
women. I am writing in support of Savanna’s
Act (H.R. 2733), introduced by Representa-
tives Dan Newhouse (R–WA), Norma Torres
(D–CA), and Deb Haaland (D–OK). Savanna’s
Act is a bipartisan effort that will help ad-
dress the crisis of missing and murdered In-
digenous women and girls (MMIWG) across
the country. I also support holding a field
hearing on the Yakama Nation Reservation.
In April 2019, two Native girls, Mary Gates
(age 14) and Myra Queahpama (age 15), went
missing from Yakima County in Washington
state. Every day they are missing makes it
more difficult to find them. Their families
deserve to be heard. I am writing to support
a field hearing on the Yakama Nation res-
ervation to learn more from our Yakima
Tribal members about this issue. Of the 56
missing Native American women in Wash-
ington, 20 are from Yakima County, accord-
ing to the National Crime Information Cen-
ter (NCIC) database.
The Women’s Commission shares the con-
cern of many about the level of violence
against women in the area. I respectfully re-
quest your committees hold a field hearing
at the Yakama Reservation, and to support
the passage of Savanna’s Act.
Thank you for your consideration and for
your strong leadership and advocacy for our
nation’s Native communities.
Sincerely,
MICHELLE GONZALEZ,

DEAR CHAIRMEN NADLER AND GRIJALVA AND
RANKING MEMBERS COLLINS AND BISHOP: On
behalf of the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe
(‘‘Tribe’’), I am writing to request that the
Committee on the Judiciary and Committee
on Natural Resources conduct a joint field
hearing in Washington State on the Missing
and Murdered Indigenous Women (‘‘MMIW’’)
epidemic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8184 October 16, 2019
The MMIW crisis is a heart-wrenching
problem impacting Indian country. Over re-
cent decades, thousands of American Indian
and Alaska Native (‘‘AI/AN’’) women have
disappeared. The Center for Disease Control
and Prevention reported that murder is the
third-leading cause of death among AI/AN
women and that rates of violence on reserva-
tions can be up to ten times higher than the
national average.
This crisis is plaguing Washington State at
an alarming rate. A 2018 report by the Urban
Indian Health Institute found that Wash-
ington State ranked second in the nation for
the number of MMIW cases (71 cases). Fur-
ther, the study determined that Seattle was
the city with the highest number of MMIW
cases (45). This is extremely concerning for
the Tribe considering we are located less
than 30 miles from Seattle.
While there is no single cause for the high
rates of MMIW, experts suggest several ex-
planations, including jurisdictional barriers;
lack of cross jurisdictional communication
and planning; failure to adequately fund
tribal justice systems; and the targeting of
Native women by sex traffickers.
Legislation pending in the Judiciary and
Natural Resources committees, including
Savanna’s Act (H.R. 2733) would help address
the MMIW crisis. Savanna’s Act, introduced
by Representatives Norma Torres, Deb
Haaland, and Dan Newhouse, would increase
coordination among all levels of law enforce-
ment; increase data collection and informa-
tion sharing; and empower tribal govern-
ments with the resources needed in cases in-
volving MMIW.
In closing, the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe
strongly encourages the Committee on the
Judiciary and Committee on Natural Re-
sources to conduct a joint field hearing in
the State of Washington on the Missing and
Murdered Indigenous Women epidemic and
related legislation.
Respectfully,
JAISON ELKINS,
Chairman,
Muckleshoot Indian Tribe.
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, these
letters outline the importance to both
our Native communities in Washington
State and the futures of indigenous
people around the country.
To quote from the Yakama Nation,
Chairman Goudy’s letter: ‘‘As the
Yakama Nation testified in Olympia,
there needs to be a genuine response to
the reports of missing and murdered
Native women and girls across Tribal
lands.’’
Chairman Goudy continues: ‘‘Also,
all new legislation needs to be guided
by a clear strategic framework and
principles to move beyond the current
conditions endangering the lives and
future generations of Native women
and girls.’’
The unique perspective of Native
communities like that of the Yakama
Nation are invaluable, Mr. Speaker, as
we continue to debate the best policies
moving forward that will actually pro-
vide solutions to this crisis. So I re-
spectfully repeat my invitation to the
House Committee on the Judiciary and
Committee on Natural Resources to
come to my congressional district in
central Washington, and I can promise
all those members and chairmen the
insight they will gain will help them
realize how this crisis truly affects our
friends and neighbors on and off Tribal
lands.
Mr. Speaker, you have heard tonight
how this devastating crisis affects
Tribes, States, and congressional dis-
tricts across the country. It is easy to
focus on these heartbreaking statistics,
but these women are more than just
numbers. They are mothers, daughters,
sisters, aunts, neighbors, and friends.
There are those who are missing,
like:
18-year-old Rosalita Longee, who was
last seen in Wapato in 2015;
37-year-old Roberta Jean Raines, last
seen in Toppenish in 2001;
29-year-old Daisy Mae Tallman, who
went missing in October of 1987; Dai-
sy’s backpack and keys were found
northwest of White Swan;
29-year-old Karen Louise Johnley,
who was last seen by a friend at the
Lazy R Tavern in Harrah, Washington
in 1987;
16-year-old Janice Hannigan, who, in
1971, went missing after she was dis-
charged by the hospital on Christmas
Eve. She never arrived home and has
never been heard from again.
Then there are also the unsolved
murders, including:
31-year-old Rosenda Strong, who was
last seen alive in Wapato on October 2
of last year. Her body was found in
July outside of Toppenish, and no ar-
rests have been made;
23-year-old Destiny Louise Lloyd,
who went missing on Christmas Day
2017. She was found days later south of
Harrah;
31-year-old Minnie Andy. Minnie was
assaulted in Wapato in July 2017. She
died from her injuries;
39-year-old Linda Dave, whose re-
mains were found in Toppenish in Feb-
ruary of 2017 under a bridge;
33-year-old mother of eight, Naoma
George. She was beaten to death in an
alley in Wapato in the fall of 2013;
44-year-old Barbara Celestine. Bar-
bara died of blunt trauma to the head
in 2005;
30-year-old Shari Dee Sampson
Elwell of Wapato. Shari was found dead
in White Swan in 1992;
44-year-old JoAnne Betty John. The
mother of 11 had been missing for 21⁄2
years before her remains were found in
1992. She was identified by her dental
records;
13-year-old Rozelia Sohappy, who was
last seen New Year’s Eve in 1988. Her
remains were found outside of Brown-
stone;
20-year-old Jenece Wilson of
Toppenish. She died of a severe blow to
the head in the summer of 1987;
26-year old Babette Crystall Green, a
member of the Warm Springs Tribe in
Oregon. Her remains were found in 1987
near Wapato;
25-year-old Clydell Alice Sampson,
who, after being missing for 2 years,
was found in 1986 by hunters outside of
Granger. She died of a shotgun blast to
the head;
33-year-old Mavis Josephine McKay.
Mavis’ remains were found in 1957 in
Satus. Mavis was a citizen of the
Umatilla Tribe.
These are just some of the women
with open cases from on or near the
Yakama Nation reservation in central
Washington, and this does not even
begin to cover the number of open
cases in other parts of the country.
This is not an issue we can ignore,
Mr. Speaker. The Native communities
we represent deserve action. Congress
must, as to provide answers to their
friends, families, and loved ones, act to
deliver justice to missing and mur-
dered indigenous women across the
country.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

UKRAINE AND IMPEACHMENT
INQUIRY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentlewoman from
Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR) is recognized for 60
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader.
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the peo-
ple of Russia have never known real
freedom.
During the 20th century, over the
course of 70 years, Joseph Stalin, the
Soviet Union’s henchman and regime
leader, and that of his successors were
responsible for the brutal murder of
millions upon millions of innocent peo-
ple inside Ukraine, Russia, Poland, and
many other Central and Eastern Euro-
pean countries that became familiarly
known as the Captive Nations.
During World War II, American sol-
diers never really made it east of Ger-
many when they liberated camps in
Germany, and so much of the truth
about what happened behind what was
called the Iron Curtain, the edge of So-
viet rule, was largely unknown to the
West.
Russia’s wretched rule included:
Forced famine, starving millions of
her own people to gain the acquies-
cence of others;
Gulags, where individuals were sent
to work in work camps and died. They
died of starvation. They died of over-
work. They died of disease;
Genocide, the wiping out of ethnic
groups that didn’t fit the perfect image
of the ruler of Russia;
Ethnic cleansing and a horrific world
war launched in collaboration with
Nazi Germany, where Nazi Germany
and the Soviet Union divided up Eu-
rope as they saw fit.
Not all Europeans have experienced
the same history. I am interested to
read some press reports now about
Eurocentric people. Well, let me tell
you, the history of Nazi Germany and
the history of occupied Ukraine or oc-
cupied Poland are completely different.
There was little value for human life
by the Soviet regime and, certainly, no
value for liberty.
Americans remember, some do, the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991
after the free world had labored since
1946 to allow that moment to happen
and the hope that it brought to mil-
lions of subjugated people beyond that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8185
October 16, 2019
Iron Curtain who dreamed of a better
way of life—not only across Europe,
but, in fact, the entire world.
The fall of the Berlin Wall was sym-
bolic, and its anniversary is celebrated
this year, 30 years since the fall of the
Berlin Wall that ushered in a new
order, a world that said liberty could
still prevail over tyranny, even in the
face of impossible odds in some of the
most forgotten places in the world.
b 1700
Images of East and West Germans as-
cending the old Berlin Wall that di-
vided freedom from tyranny stood as
that symbol. And those individuals
who had lived in West Germany and
East Germany who climbed that wall
and met for the first time in decades
serves as one of the most powerful
symbols of freedom in human history.
As families were reunited, new demo-
cratic institutions rose from the ashes,
where tyranny once dominated.
The United States became a beacon
of light to those people in an ever-
growing free world following the re-
building of Europe in the post-World
War II climate and then, over four dec-
ades later, the Soviet Union’s demise.
The World War II Memorial that
stands here in Washington, D.C., in
fact, is testimony to the 20th century’s
greatest achievement, the victory of
liberty over tyranny.
Yet, in the ashes of the Soviet re-
gime, the seeds of tyranny survived in
the memories of its most ardent lieu-
tenants and supporters. And one of
them, the current Russian President,
Vladimir Putin, who for years served
as a Soviet spy in the KGB, is orches-
trating Russia’s vengeful march to re-
store its former empire.
Today, Ukraine represents the scrim-
mage line in the fight for liberty on the
European continent. And why does it
matter to America? Because those al-
lies in Europe have democratic repub-
lics like ours. They are our closest po-
litical allies on the face of the Earth.
We do not live alone on this Earth.
America does not live alone on this
Earth, but, rather, we have a security
system that was established following
World War II that has held together
the leaders of the free world.
Vladimir Putin’s greatest fear is an
economically successful and demo-
cratic Ukraine at Russia’s borders. A
free Ukraine would undermine Putin’s
fragile, corrupt rule based on stealing—
stealing land, stealing money from the
people of Ukraine, and lining his pock-
ets and those of his cronies.
A free Ukraine sends a message, too,
to the Russian people, a people who
have never known liberty in their own
right, that freedom is also attainable
for them.
For this reason, Putin would go to
any length, and is—assassinations,
poisonings, war, torture—to steal from
the Ukrainian people their right to
choose their own destiny—40 million
people—40 million people at the
stepstone to all of Europe, the largest
landmass nation in all of Europe. They
have a right to choose their own des-
tiny.
In the aftermath of World War II, the
United States, alongside our allied
partners in the then newly formed
North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
more familiarly called NATO, created
precious institutions to build soli-
darity and security among the war’s
transatlantic allied victors—institu-
tions that had never existed before.
America invested trillions of dollars
in programs, beginning with the Mar-
shall Plan, to build vigilant networks
to stymie and, ultimately, reverse the
spread of state-imposed communism.
The American people, in a very war-
worn country after World War II, re-
built Europe through the Marshall
Plan. Wow.
Western-funded programs worked to
rebuild Europe, and, though the Nazis
were defeated, millions still found
themselves trapped under dictatorial
rule behind that Iron Curtain east of
the Berlin Wall.
Ukraine was one of those nations
forced to exist under Soviet occupation
until Ukrainian citizens declared their
own independence after the fall of the
Berlin Wall in a democratic, nation-
wide referendum in 1991, the only such
referendum by any former Soviet re-
public.
An astounding 84 percent of their
voting-age population participated in
that referendum, and more than 90 per-
cent of them voted to separate from
the Soviet Union and chart their own
national course.
That was a new page that turned in
world history. Even in the eastern por-
tions of Ukraine, in Crimea, a majority
voted to be part of independent
Ukraine. In one voice, the Ukrainian
people decisively voted for and favored
liberty over tyranny. What a dramatic
moment in world history as liberty at-
tempted to move eastward.
But, even then, the struggle for lib-
erty in Ukraine was far from over. It
was only beginning. And we can see it
in real time even until today.
In 2014, the Ukrainian people rose up
in the Ukrainian revolution of dignity
against leaders in Ukraine that had be-
come utterly corrupt, the pro-Russian
leader then, President Viktor
Yanukovych, after he rejected—why
did they rise up? Because he rejected
an association agreement with the Eu-
ropean Union.
And at whose behest did he do that?
Vladimir Putin’s.
Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian
protesters immediately moved to oc-
cupy the central plaza of their capital
city, Kiev, Ukraine. Clashes between
those protesters and the riot police be-
came violent and resulted in the deaths
of nearly 130 civilians. Most of them
died from government-ordered sniper
fire.
As tensions rose, Yanukovych fled—
guess where?—to Russia to take cover.
And, on that same day, by a vote of
328–0, their congress, their parliament,
voted that Yanukovych be removed
from office.
The fight for liberty is being lived in
real time. The world can see it—not
just the Ukrainian people; the Amer-
ican people, the leader of the free
world, for heavens’ sake.
In that very same year, Vladimir
Putin mobilized Russia’s vast military
machine, one of the largest on Earth,
to illegally and without provocation
invade Ukraine at its Crimean edge and
launch a not-so-covert war on
Ukraine’s eastern flank, a clear effort
to rewind history and reimpose his
dreamed neo-Soviet empire.
Over 5 years later, Ukraine remains
in an heroic struggle to preserve its
hard-fought freedom and sovereignty.
Its people have bravely faced down ar-
tillery barrages and live sniper and ma-
chine gun fire carried out by pro-Rus-
sian forces coming across the border,
including Putin’s little green men.
While the country, Ukraine, is not
yet a member of the European Union or
NATO, which it so wishes to be, its
men and women, including civilians,
have bravely fought and died defending
Europe and their own fragile democ-
racy.
Put yourselves in their position.
What would you do if that happened in
the United States of America?
In the 5 years since the war started,
14,000 Ukrainians have been killed,
30,000 have been wounded, and nearly 2
million internally displaced in the con-
flict with Russia.
It is a war that groans on with little
notice but enormous consequences for
liberty in this modern era.
As Ukraine’s defense forces crumbled
due to years of corruption and mis-
management, the Ukrainian people
took up the cause to defend their own
nation. They have been seriously
underequipped. And their heroism and,
I might add, sheroism shines. Coura-
geous women from the invisible bat-
talion left their college studies and
took taxis to the frontlines to thwart
Moscow’s war.
It was like a David and Goliath
struggle. Indeed, it has been the
strength of the Ukrainian people that
has fought Russia to a standstill for a
moment.
Just as we and our allies fought So-
viet aggression in the 20th century, the
Ukrainian people are in the trenches
fighting Russian aggression in the 21st.
They have more than earned the re-
spect and continuing support of the
United States and the free world.
When the Soviet Union collapsed,
one-third of the Soviet nuclear arsenal
remained in Ukraine. There are two
countries in the world that have nu-
clear weapons aimed: Russia, at us; and
the United States, prepared to take
them down if they would ever dare send
them in this direction.
But one-third of what the Soviet
Union held in terms of nuclear
strength remained in Ukraine, de facto
providing Ukraine the world’s third
largest nuclear weapons arsenal.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8186 October 16, 2019
But, in 1994, by signing the Budapest
Memorandum, Ukraine agreed to give
up the nuclear weapons in its territory
in return for security assistance by the
United States, Russia, and the United
Kingdom. Think about that.
A promise was made. Ukraine’s inde-
pendence, national sovereignty, and
borders would be respected. By annex-
ing Crimea and waging a devastating
war on the eastern side of Ukraine
called the Donbas, Russia has severely
violated the terms of this foundational
security agreement.
Lest we forget, Russia retained its
nuclear arsenal, and their weapons re-
main aimed at us, the United States of
America, and our NATO allies in Eu-
rope.
The list of violations goes on. The
basket one provisions of the Helsinki
Accords, which the Soviet Union signed
in 1975, along with the United States,
Canada, and more than 30 European
countries, as well as bilateral agree-
ments that the Russian Federation
signed with Ukraine in 1997, have effec-
tively been thrown to the wayside.
In addition, Russia’s forcible annex-
ation of Crimea and sponsorship of a
hot war in Ukraine’s east since 2014
violates numerous United Nations
agreements that Russia, the Ukraine,
the United States, and other countries
have signed going back to the organiza-
tion’s founding in 1945.
While it would be convenient to only
blame Russia for the destabilization of
this region, I must say, President
Trump’s recent illegal block of more
than $391 million in military aid to
Ukraine was not only a blow to
Ukrainian security and to its new
president, but to our own.
Russia on the march does not serve
the security interests of the United
States. The United States and NATO
have a vital interest in stopping the
Kremlin’s aggression in Ukraine. That
Trump did so, in denying military as-
sistance, in delaying military assist-
ance to Ukraine, in pursuit of a per-
sonal political agenda for 2020, makes
it not only a betrayal of U.S. security
interests but, also, a legal issue.
It looks like just the sort of perver-
sion of the justice system that Ukraine
has suffered for decades.
To date, there are no records detail-
ing President Trump’s or his adminis-
tration’s official secret meetings and
phone calls with Russian President
Putin and his top lieutenants. There is
no documentation to date on why
President Trump lifted sanctions on
key Putin oligarchs and supporters.
If records exist, they, I hope, have
not been unlawfully squirreled away
somewhere by senior White House
staff, similar to actions alleged in the
September 2019 whistleblower com-
plaint.
It is clear that Putin has been at war
with Ukraine to restore its domination
in that neighborhood. The United
States should do nothing to make it
easier. Tragically, it appears President
Trump is accommodating and, perhaps,
abetting him.
It is no wonder that our current the
President was Putin’s preferred can-
didate in 2016 and remains so for 2020.
Now, Paul Manafort, President
Trump’s 2016 campaign manager, sits
in Federal prison right now for tax eva-
sion, but his crimes are much worse.
b 1715
He took millions of dollars, millions
of dollars to lobby for the pro-Russian,
anti-American, Ukrainian President,
Viktor Yanukovych, who he mentioned
earlier, whose own people drove him
out the country.
Yanukovych personally took his or-
ders from Putin, who personally di-
rected Russia’s interference in U.S.
elections and ordered the war in
Ukraine.
Take Rudy Giuliani, President
Trump’s personal lawyer. He has been
carrying out a shadow foreign policy
campaign, at the Trump administra-
tion’s behest, to undermine their polit-
ical rivals and boost the President’s re-
election.
Recently, it was confirmed that
Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy
Giuliani, turned to Manafort, who is
sitting in jail, for advice in his efforts
to fabricate falsehoods on Vice Presi-
dent Joe Biden. The President and
Giuliani even enlisted the support of
U.S. Government officials in this
scheme, co-opting U.S. taxpayer dol-
lars for personal political gain.
When the United States Ambassador
to Ukraine refused to aid and abet
their plot, President Trump purged the
highly respected U.S. Ambassador,
Marie Yovanovitch, who dutifully
served our country with distinction
throughout her adult life. During her
service, Ukraine successfully carried
out two democratic elections during a
time of war and significant duress and
made enormous progress on its
anticorruption efforts.
Ambassador Yovanovitch’s steady
and principled vision, steeped in a long
tradition of U.S. diplomatic excellence,
was exactly what was needed to shep-
herd the Ukrainian people along the
jagged path toward democratic reform.
Ambassador Yovanovitch represented
the United States at the highest levels
of her career in other countries facing
similar challenges—Armenia, for one,
and Kyrgyzstan—under Republican and
Democratic administrations. She
served Presidents in both parties. It is,
indeed, rare for a member of the For-
eign Service to serve as an ambassador,
let alone three times in very dangerous
places. This is a true testament to her
diplomatic seasoning, from which I be-
lieve our President could learn some-
thing.
Tragically, the purging of Ambas-
sador Yovanovitch is but the surface of
the contempt that this White House
and some of my Republican Congres-
sional colleagues have treated public
servants who place their lives at risk
serving the American people’s love of
liberty, day in and day out.
President Trump, let the record
show, who dodged service in the U.S.
military, seems to have no under-
standing of the value of our trans-
atlantic alliances and at what cost
they have been won and built. They are
the single most important guarantor of
our security and freedom. America
needs friendly allies who share our
democratic values and believe in the
rule of law.
Recently, we have learned that while
the Trump-appointed U.S. Ambassador
to the European Union should have
been focused on repairing relations
with Europe, as our own President has
embarrassed European Presidents and
leaders publicly, the Ambassador to
the European Union found himself in
Ukraine, arranging meetings to con-
duct opposition research on President
Trump’s political opponents.
It cannot be overstated just how
much the actions of our President and
Rudy Giuliani have undermined U.S.
strategic interests and the progress
Ukraine has made to strengthen its de-
mocracy and deter Russian aggression.
Imagine how the young new Presi-
dent of Ukraine felt when the Presi-
dent of the United States said to him
that the military aid that was due to
have been dispensed in the middle of
this summer from the United States
would actually be held until that Presi-
dent would do our President a favor re-
lated to his own reelection. Wow.
For the Trump-led minions, our gov-
ernment does not serve the people.
Rather, unfortunately, it is serving
him.
While we continue to seek coopera-
tion with the Trump administration to
help our own people here at home in so
many ways—the cost of prescription
drugs, trying to get an infrastructure
bill passed in the House and the Sen-
ate, trying to deal with corruption in
our own political system—Congress
must investigate these deeply trou-
bling episodes abroad. The Constitu-
tion demands that we conduct our af-
fairs in a constitutionally mandated
role of oversight and the impeachment
inquiry, which is ongoing. We must as-
certain to what extent the President
and his advisers abused their power and
held up critical military aid to Ukraine
for their own political gain.
Thus far, the President’s defense has
been complete resistance, not pro-
viding the materials necessary for a
full congressional investigation in
what seems to be an ongoing campaign
to intimidate State Department offi-
cials from testifying before Congress,
which really means before the Amer-
ican people.
The American people have a right to
know the truth. This is an open soci-
ety. We don’t need stonewalling from
this administration.
We should ask the President what he
has to hide. The American people know
the difference between truth and fic-
tion.

States, Ukraine, and our allies by al-
lowing Putin to succeed in his sinister
mission.
Despite President Trump’s neg-
ligence, the United States Congress re-
mains laser-focused on the threat from
Russia. It is serious, and it is real.
While Ukraine fights for its very ex-
istence, the United States Congress
and freedom-lovers everywhere must
continue to support Ukraine through
military aid, programs to fight corrup-
tion, and the development of civil soci-
ety, which the American people do so
well.
Congress must get to the bottom of
President Trump’s effort to withhold
vital defense aid to Ukraine. She is fac-
ing a mortal enemy. This is liberty at
stake in our lifetimes. Will we meet
the challenge?
The abuses of power outlined in the
whistleblower complaint underscore
the danger that President Trump’s de-
cisions pose to American national secu-
rity and democracy itself. The Amer-
ican people must learn to what extent
the President solicited interference
from a foreign country in the upcoming
2020 U.S. Presidential election.
From our own FBI, we have learned
how many times Russia interfered in
the last election and how many times
then-candidate Trump contacted Rus-
sia during the campaign.
I was thinking about that one night.
If I were running for President of the
United States, would I be in touch with
Russia nearly 200 times? Think about
that. How unusual is that?
The American Presidency cannot be
a tool for Russia to gain its insidiously
destructive power. Above all, the
American people deserve liberty first,
last, and always in a political system
free of malign foreign influence.
Long live a free America, and may
the people of Ukraine ultimately gain
the freedom they so justly deserve.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
CHINA: ONE WORLD, TWO
SYSTEMS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL)
for 30 minutes.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I
certainly enjoyed my colleague’s dis-
sertation there, much of which was a
criticism of the Chief Executive of our
country, when many of the same com-
ments she made could be directed at
this House and its investigation of the
President—not following the prece-
dents set, not following the precedents
set in the Nixon impeachment or in the
Clinton impeachment.
The Speaker has not had a vote of
this House to commence an impeach-
ment inquiry. That is an open system.
That is the transparency my friend was
talking about. That is the kind of ac-
countability the American people
would like to see. That should be the
policy of this House. Sadly, it is not.
She talks about contacts with Russia
by political campaigns. Many of us
look forward to the investigation by
the Attorney General and by the U.S.
attorney in Connecticut on exactly
that in the 2016 campaign and how the
opposition party, the Clinton cam-
paign, was, in fact, the one digging up
activities about the Trump campaign.
So, anyway, I enjoyed that comment
about Ukraine, the importance of
Ukraine, and the importance of democ-
racy in Ukraine. But all throughout
that presentation, one had to endure a
lot of supposition and fiction.
Tonight, Mr. Speaker, I would like to
talk, not talk about Ukraine, not talk
about Syria, but talk about China and
where we are in this very important,
critical bilateral negotiation between
the United States and the People’s Re-
public of China to end China’s mer-
cantilistic trade environment, their
lack of openness, their failure to police
the terrible intellectual property theft
that has gone on for over two decades
there that has hurt not only American
businesses but those elsewhere in Asia
and also in Europe.
I commend the President for calling
out the challenge that we have had and
faced in the West on how to obtain
China as a better player for trade.
President Trump has worked for nearly
3 years now to change China’s outlook,
to end its mercantilistic protectionism
and join the world trading system
truly, not just on paper, Mr. Speaker,
but, in fact, completely, and be one
with the developed world as it has
grown its economy so mightily over
those two decades.
I commend the President’s point men
on this issue: Larry Kudlow at the Na-
tional Economic Council; Secretary
Mnuchin, the Secretary of the Treas-
ury; and Ambassador Robert
Lighthizer, who is his U.S. Trade Rep-
resentative who has the point on try-
ing to work out something that is a
major change in that relationship be-
tween the U.S. and China, but also
China and the rest of the developed
world.
At the heart of this trade dispute is
the fact that we live in an integrated
global economy with deeply connected,
multicontinental supply chains. This
integrated global economy is based on
the extraordinary foundation of the
post-World War II reductions in trade
barriers, the expansion of the rule of
law, and the extraordinary success of
the free-market capitalist system that
has lifted so many out of poverty
around the world since World War II
and enlivened the capitalist spirit
throughout the world.
Beginning slowly in the 1970s and
1980s, the People’s Republic of China
was encouraged to open its domestic
market, increase economic freedom,
better respect human rights and reli-
gious tolerance, and join the global
family of nations.
Following the fall of the Berlin Wall
and the reunification of Germany, as
that freedom breeze finally blew away
the shroud of the Iron Curtain, reform
in China remained the next great
touchstone of the post-World War II
agenda.
The 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen
Square sidetracked this progress, but
China’s integration into this world
economy began in earnest in the 1990s.
That is where this story gets com-
plicated, and that is where the concern
of President Trump really begins.
European and American leaders who
shared values of economic freedom, re-
ligious tolerance, and common na-
tional security goals witnessed the his-
toric and extraordinary transition of
post-war Japan and the Asian Tigers,
those countries of Singapore, Taiwan,
Hong Kong, and South Korea.
Over the decades, the Asian Tigers
had been authoritarian, condemned for
their rampant theft of intellectual
property and spurning of democracy, so
much so that, in 1976, when Jimmy
Carter was elected President of the
United States, he campaigned on pull-
ing American troops out of South
Korea, ending aid to South Korea and
writing off South Korea as a failed ex-
periment, that it was going to be an
authoritarian dictatorship and never
adapt to democracy, never stop steal-
ing intellectual property. Basically,
write it off as a failure.
b 1730
Fortunately, this initiative was
shelved and, instead, we witnessed
Japan and the Asian Tigers expand
their economies, really begin to open
their markets, fully embrace democ-
racy and the rule of law, and join in
the world global progress.
Policymakers considered China to be
next, and they believed that, while a
much larger country, under a much
more authoritative communist regime,
the economic benefits of greater free-
dom and global transparency would
penetrate even the Middle Kingdom.
In 1996, in a column in the Arkansas
Democrat-Gazette offering suggestions
to the Clinton administration on how
to have a more directed China policy, I
argued that China, too, must change. I
said: ‘‘China, as a world power, for her
part must recognize that bilateral and
multilateral treaties are to be en-
forced. Lack of compliance with inter-
national treaty obligations must
produce a known and delivered set of
sanctions by the world community.
China must clearly understand the con-
sequences of noncompliance.’’
So, Mr. Speaker, that is what I wrote
back in 1996 as a private citizen, former
Bush administration official, thinking
about what needed to change in Amer-
ica and Chinese relations, China’s mul-
tilateral relations.
So, despite encouragement and best
intentions, China has not changed, Mr.
Speaker, but, instead, has grown more

aggressive; hence, the challenge of one
world, two systems is market-based
capitalism versus state-controlled
communism. They are not compatible
when it comes to this complex, inte-
grated global capital market I de-
scribed.
In the 1990s, the epicenter of the fight
was to reign in rampant theft of intel-
lectual property. At the time I uttered
those words in 1996, the U.S. computer
software industry, music CDs, and Hol-
lywood videos all were being ripped off
by the People’s Republic of China. In
1992, the Business Software Alliance
testified before the U.S. Senate that
Chinese piracy was costing the U.S. an
estimated $225 million in software
sales.
The reality is, despite efforts in 1992
at the end of the Bush 41 administra-
tion and vigorous efforts by President
Clinton’s negotiators Charlene
Barshefsky and Mickey Kantor, essen-
tially nothing happened. President
Clinton threatened to impose 100 per-
cent tariffs on select imports if Beijing
didn’t enforce Mr. Clinton’s new 1995
intellectual property rights deal.
So, what happened? Does this sound
familiar? Is this not the exact con-
versation we are having today in 2019?
What happened in 1995? Meeting after
meeting was held, agreement after
agreement was signed, and still the pi-
racy continued. And to my point about
the world delivering a known set of
sanctions that China must clearly un-
derstand the consequences of non-
compliance, instead, China was re-
warded and admitted to the World
Trade Organization, the WTO, in De-
cember 2001.
Sadly, pirated goods have only in-
creased. Recently, the Business Soft-
ware Alliance, the same folks I quoted
back in 1992, now estimate that 70 per-
cent of PC software installed in China
in 2015 was unlicensed, and the U.S.
trade representative estimates that in-
tellectual property theft costs between
$225 billion and $600 billion, annually.
Thus, the world has not banded to-
gether and offered clear and known
sanctions for not following the global
trade rules. In fact, global trading
partners have rewarded such behavior
with the admission to the WTO and
continue to tolerate IP theft, closed
domestic markets, and dependency on
frequently dominant Chinese supply
chain participants.
This is why President Trump has
elected to go forward with a more ag-
gressive, direct manner and deliver the
message that lack of compliance with
international treaty obligations must
produce a known and delivered set of
sanctions by the world community.
However, the President’s success in
this endeavor may well be diluted by
the opening up of trade disputes all
over the world simultaneously, includ-
ing disputes with America’s allies.
Specifically, I am talking about
across-the-board unilateral steel and
aluminum tariffs, for example, or try-
ing to renegotiate every trade treaty
that we have all at the same time,
while we are trying to press China.
Now, that is not to take anything
away from the extraordinary work of
the President and Ambassador
Lighthizer to update the North Amer-
ican Free Trade Agreement with the
new USMCA, updating the U.S.-South
Korea Free Trade Agreement, and ini-
tiating and completing an agricultural
agreement with Japan. But I have to
say that doing all that at once and not
engaging our allies fully and publicly
to be at our side impressing China, I
think, makes it more difficult, be-
cause, as I have traced over the past 25
years the lack of success with China,
the one thing that I would argue that
will make it different this time—al-
ways dangerous words to utter—would
be if we had the European Union,
Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Phil-
ippines, South American countries all
at our side as we tried to get a concrete
change in China’s mercantilistic be-
havior.
In my view, the President would be
more successful if he focused on this
Chinese challenge and rallied the world
to a common purpose of focusing China
on that important point to clearly un-
derstand the consequences of non-
compliance. We have done many things
in this country that are improving that
relationship and fighting, but we must
have full global support in order, I
think and I believe, to ultimately lever
China into compliance.
Not successful in Bush 41, not suc-
cessful with President Clinton, not suc-
cessful with President George W. Bush,
little effort by President Obama, so I
admire President Trump for identi-
fying this challenge that benefits the
whole world, not just the United
States; but it is going to take a sus-
tained multiyear, multilateral effort to
do that, and I wish him well, and those
of us in this House stand by him as he
tries to get a quality, substantive deal
to bring China truly into compliance.
CONGRATULATING CARL CARTER
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I
want to recognize some Arkansans who
have done extraordinary things in my
home district in central Arkansas.
I rise today to recognize Carl Carter
for being awarded the 2019 Community
Service Award by the Real Estate Edu-
cators of America for exceptional spirit
of service.
Carl is a second-year student attend-
ing the University of Arkansas Clinton
School of Public Service in Little
Rock. Carl credits his strong commu-
nity service to his mom, Beverly Car-
ter, who lost her life at the hands of
two people posing as real estate cli-
ents.
Carl founded the Beverly Carter
Foundation in her memory, an organi-
zation dedicated to the cause of helping
real estate agent safety.
Through the Beverly Carter Founda-
tion, Carl works to improve agent safe-
ty through traveling and talking to es-
crow agents, lenders, agents, and bro-
kers all over the United States on how
to avoid being the victims of crime.
I know this is only the beginning for
Carl, and I am excited to see where his
ambition and his kind heart take him,
and I congratulate him on this good
work.
RECOGNIZING SEARCY FIRE DEPARTMENT
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the Searcy Fire
Department and the firefighters from
Station 1 for going above and beyond
the call of duty.
Earlier this summer, firefighters re-
sponded to a call for a fire alarm at a
resident’s home in Searcy, Arkansas.
Fortunately, the resident was not in
immediate danger, but they did notice
one issue: The resident could not leave
his home without assistance, as there
was not a wheelchair ramp.
The firefighters at Station 1 took it
upon themselves to fix this situation.
They reached out to the community for
help, including the local Lowe’s Home
Improvement store. They got dis-
counted supplies. The Searcy Fire De-
partment Ladies Auxiliary provided
funding, and these firefighters were
able to build a ramp for this resident.
This is just a small example of how
the Searcy Fire Department and cen-
tral Arkansas law enforcement officers
go above and beyond the call when
keeping Arkansans safe. I thank them
for their continued hard work and serv-
ice.
CONGRATULATING RYAN DAVIS
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to congratulate Ryan Davis
for receiving the Arkansas Emergency
Medical Technician Association Air
Medical Award of Excellence. This
award honors those who help the air
medical industry continue to see
growth.
Ryan grew up in Quitman, Arkansas,
and is currently the fire chief for this
community. Ryan is a nationally reg-
istered emergency medical technician
and paramedic and is flight paramedic
certified.
Ryan has served his community since
2003 and also works for Air Evac
Lifeteam 30 in Morrilton. Ryan has
served on numerous State-level boards
and committees, including the Amer-
ican Heart Association, the National
Association of EMTs, and also the Ar-
kansas Air Medical Society, where he
serves as president.
I would like to extend my congratu-
lations to Ryan Davis for receiving this
prestigious award.
RECOGNIZING JAMIE CHENEY
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to honor Jamie Cheney of
Greenbrier, Arkansas, for her out-
standing service to our community and
the State of Arkansas.
Jamie serves as a local medical tech-
nician and also as a volunteer fire-
fighter on her day off. She gained her
EMT skills at the University of Arkan-
sas Community College at Morrilton,
where she juggled school while working

RECOGNIZING LINDSAY HENDERSON
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize and congratu-
late an emerging leader from the
Conway Area Chamber of Commerce,
Lindsay Henderson.
Lindsay is a Bald Knob resident and
serves as the chief revenue officer for
the Conway Area Chamber of Com-
merce. Lindsay was awarded the Asso-
ciation of Chamber of Commerce Ex-
ecutives’ 40 Under 40 award.
The 40 Under 40 award honors young
professionals who have demonstrated
significant success in their career, as
well as having made noteworthy ac-
complishments in their community.
The Association of Chamber of Com-
merce Executives recognizes emerging
leaders from chambers across the coun-

sionals who exemplify creativity, dedi-
cation, and innovation in their work
towards their chamber’s mission.
I congratulate Lindsay on achieving

DECLINE IN THE U.S. MURDER
RATE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I in-
tend to address the good news that we
had a significant drop in murders in
this country in 2017 over the recent
peak in 2016.
However, before I address the House
on that matter, I would like to yield to
the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr.
MOONEY), my good friend.
Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr.
Speaker, I thank Congressman
GROTHMAN for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I spoke a little earlier
in a 1 minute on this topic, but I was a
little pressed for time, and I saw my
good friend from Arkansas, Mr. HILL,
speaking on this and other important
issues, and my friend from Wisconsin,
and I thought I would expand a little
bit upon my remarks earlier.
As the previous speaker just talked
about, we have important trade issues
and other issues the President of the
United States is working on with other
countries, and I couldn’t agree more
that those are important issues to be
working on. That is exactly what the
President and Congress should be fo-
cused on. In fact, it should be focused
on that in a bipartisan way, Repub-
licans and Democrats working to-
gether.
Instead, what we are faced with is
this pretty bizarre impeachment in-
quiry process. I think it is important
for the American people to know and
understand how this is supposed to
work and how it is working.
An impeachment inquiry sounds,
first, like it is a fair discussion process,
but in the past, during impeachment
inquiries of President Nixon and Presi-
dent Clinton, the House of Representa-
tives right here, led respectfully at the
time by Speakers Carl Albert and Newt
Gingrich, established the following
procedures that are currently not being
provided in this rushed process to at-
tempt to impeach President Trump.
This is an important precedent when
you are dealing with the President of
the United States, who is duly elected
by the people of this country. The peo-
ple of the West Virginia Second Con-
gressional District that I represent
voted for Donald Trump for President.
This country, in the fair process of
the electoral college, put Donald
Trump in as President of the United
States, and my district voted for Don-
ald Trump for President of the United
States. So that is how we choose the
leader of our country.
I stood there on the steps of the Cap-
itol just a few years ago and watched
Donald Trump be inaugurated as Presi-
dent, with the support of all the former
living Presidents who attended at the
time.
Our country has a process that is
emulated in this world, admired by the
world, that we have a free election and
we respect the results of that election.
Instead, what we are seeing here, an-
nounced by the Speaker of the House,
is this so-called impeachment inquiry.
However, she is denying this President
the same rights that other Presidents
were given under this so-called im-
peachment inquiry.
And what exactly are those? I think
it is important to understand how this
has happened in the past and how it
should be happening right now but is
not.
I think my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle, the Democrats in Con-
gress here, would like the American
people not to understand what they are
doing. But first and foremost, in the
past when this was done, the two times
it was done in the past, I am going to
list the seven things, the seven rights
that have always been given to the ac-
cused party. In this case, that is Don-
ald Trump, the President of the United
States.
First, in the committee hearings,
there should be given coequal subpoena
power to both the chairman of the
committee and the ranking member of
the committee, which is the minority
party. At that committee level, they
are given coequal power to subpoena
witnesses. Right now it is one-sided.
Those who want to impeach Donald
Trump are subpoenaing witness after
witness after witness, and the other
side does not have the power to sub-
poena witnesses to maybe offer
counterinformation. That is how a fair
process is supposed to work.
Secondly, all subpoenas have been
subject to a vote of the full committee
at the request of either the chairman
or the ranking member. So to avoid a
one-person witch hunt, when you want
to subpoena somebody, the head of ei-
ther party here in Congress can request
a committee vote, and the committee
can vote ‘‘yes’’ to subpoena or ‘‘no’’ to
subpoena. So rather than one person
making all the decisions, which seems
to be how it is occurring right now, you
have at least the committee input.
That is how it has been done in the
past. That is not happening right now.
Third, the President’s counsel had
the right to attend all hearings and
depositions. Can you imagine that? We
have hearings and depositions going on
right now in the committees, and the
President and his counsel who rep-
resent him are not even allowed to
hear what is being said about him. This
is, again, a denial of the basic right in
America in a legal process of any kind.
The President’s counsel has had the
right to present evidence, because
when you had evidence being presented
on one side, unless it is a kangaroo
court, you had evidence presented on
the other side. That is being denied to
the President of the United States.
The President’s counsel has always
had the right to object to the admit-
tance of evidence. Again, another basic
legal procedure, a legal right. The evi-
dence being presented, it may have
some objections to it, it may not be ac-
curate for a variety of reasons. The
President is not there, his counsel is
not there. He can’t even object to the
evidence being presented.
In the past, the President’s counsel
had the right to cross-examine wit-
nesses. This should be familiar. In this
country, we have a right to face those
who accuse us, the right to face our ac-
cuser and the right to cross-examine
witnesses. Basic legal precepts in this
country.
Last, the President’s counsel would
have the right to recommend a witness
list.
So, Mr. Speaker, it is important to
understand that our President is being
denied these seven basic legal rights to
defend himself right now. This is not a
fair and just system in any way.
My mother fled a communist coun-
try. When she was 20 years old, she was
in Cuba. Fidel Castro came down from
the mountains with guns and locked
her and her family up. My mother was
in prison for 7 weeks.
In communist countries, you have to
prove your innocence. You are accused
first, and then you are stuck with the
burden of somehow trying to prove you
didn’t do something, trying to prove
that you are not guilty.
In this country, they have to prove
you are guilty. You have the right to
be presumed innocent. Innocent until
proven guilty.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8190 October 16, 2019
Mr. Speaker, it is a disgrace what is
happening here. The President is some-
how in this court of public opinion
with one-sided evidence trying to prove
his innocence to people who are assum-
ing he is guilty and haven’t presented
any real evidence to that fact.
Even if a person is not a supporter of
President Trump, they still should ob-
ject to this process. Only imagine if
they were falsely accused of something
or God forbid their son or daughter was
falsely accused of something. They
would expect their child to have these
same basic rights of legal process to de-
fend themselves.
If they can deny these rights to the
President of the United States of
America, rest assured, my colleagues
on the other side of the aisle will deny
that right to other citizens one day. We
should be alarmed at this no matter
where we stand on the issue of liking
President Trump or not.
Mr. Speaker, with that, I again
thank my colleague from Wisconsin,
Congressman GROTHMAN, for yielding
me this time.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I
would now like to address the body on
the topic of the recent decline of mur-
ders in the United States of America.
For people who watch this House, we
know that there are all sorts of bad
things we can dwell on. We can dwell
on the immigration crisis, we can dwell
on high healthcare costs, we can dwell
on the debt, but recently some rel-
atively good news—we have more work
to do—was brought forth, and that is
the murder rates for 2018 were pub-
lished.
Largely in this country, murder rates
skyrocketed from the early 1960s, when
we had the beginning of the welfare
culture, the war on the family under
Lyndon Johnson, and murder rates rose
from around 5 per 100,000 to over 10 per
100,000 in 1980. Murder rates stayed rel-
atively high throughout the 1980s and
the early 1990s.
Since that time, I think in part be-
cause of increased incarceration, those
murder rates were falling until 2015.
And then, I think in part because of
a government that spoke negatively of
police, talked about or implied that po-
lice shootings were racially motivated,
something happened opposite of what
had been going on the 25 years before
that.
All of a sudden for 2 years in a row,
the number of people murdered in this
country jumped up, jumped up from a
low of 4.4 to 5.4 per 100,000 in the years
2015 and 2016.
After that, we can talk about wheth-
er it was because of this or not, but
Donald Trump took over, somebody
who ran encouraging support of the po-
lice, respect of the police, and the mur-
der rate began to drop a little bit in
2017, and last year, it one more time
fell to less than 5 per 100,000.
President Trump ran, of course, on
respect for police. That is one of the
reasons I think people wanted him in
there.
The prior President, a dignified man,
had Al Sharpton in the White House
over 80 times. And I think if you look,
Barack Obama is praising Black Lives
Matter, is encouraging people to view
police with distrust, was perhaps one of
the reasons why, completely out of the
ordinary at a time when the economy
was not bad, we had police shootings
rise significantly.
Now we have a President who, as the
yard signs in my district say, ‘‘Respect
the Badge’’, we have somebody as a
President who is more a respect-the-
badge sort of guy, and in 1 year we
have a decrease in murders in this
country—despite the fact the popu-
lation continues to grow—of 1,000 peo-
ple; 1,000 lives saved.
We have to ask ourselves, why was
there a spike in murders before Presi-
dent Trump took office and why was
there a reduction in murders after he
took office?
As I mentioned, I think the embrac-
ing of people like Al Sharpton, who en-
courages disrespect for police, or at
least blames them, blames sad shoot-
ings on racial motivation, I think that
is one of the reasons why you had an
increase.
You had police who were afraid to do
what they could do for fear of being
sanctioned. You had people maybe
afraid to go to the police to report
criminals, perhaps because they were
told the police were their enemy.
But in any event, in this era, I
haven’t checked, but I am sure Al
Sharpton hasn’t been invited to the
White House a dozen times in President
Trump’s first 3 years. I would be sur-
prised if he was there at all, actually.
Instead, we have someone who knows
that as long as the police are appro-
priately doing their job, he has their
back. And we have seen that signifi-
cant drop in the last 2 years, which is
rare good news that you get.
I anxiously await when the statistics
come out for the year 2019. We know
there was another drop of about 7 per-
cent in the massive city south of me in
Chicago, I believe, in the first 7 months
of the year. We saw another 10 percent
drop in Milwaukee. There was another
drop in New York.
Is this a coincidence or is it because
our police know that they are re-
spected at the highest level of govern-
ment?
So I know when I get back home, I
hear some people talk about crime and
worry about crime, and there is more
work that has to be done. Obviously,
having as many people as we have mur-
dered every year is still a figure way
too high, but a drop of 1,000 was a sig-
nificant drop.
I hope everybody pays attention to
what I believe is another drop that is
going to happen in 2019, and I hope ev-
erybody realizes that this may not
have been just an aberration. One thou-
sand lives are a lot of lives. It could be
the result of a policy based on respect
for the police, punishing police when
they are wrong, no doubt about that,
and there are bad police, but not a love
affair with Black Lives Matter; re-
specting the fact that when studies
have been done by groups such as the
National Academy of Sciences, they
find that when police do kill people, it
is collectively not a racially motivated
or a racial thing.
It is, sadly, something that happens
because sometimes people do wrong
things and it is usually people that are
in the process of or are trying not to be
apprehended from very dangerous
crimes. And a couple times, a few
times, it does happen because police
make mistakes. But when it is, it
shouldn’t be used to tarnish police as a
whole and it shouldn’t be used to come
out with the idea that these things are
racially motivated.
So there is my report on the good
news to the American people.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

PUBLICATION OF BUDGETARY
MATERIAL
STATUS REPORT ON CURRENT SPENDING LEVELS
OF ON-BUDGET SPENDING AND REVENUES FOR
FY 2019
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET,
Washington, DC, October 16, 2019.
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: To facilitate appli-
cation of sections 302 and 311 of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974, I am transmitting
an updated status report on the current lev-
els of on-budget spending and revenues for
fiscal year 2019. This status report is current
through September 30, the end of fiscal year
2019. The term ‘‘current level’’ refers to the
amounts of spending and revenues estimated
for each fiscal year based on laws enacted or
awaiting the President’s signature.
Table 1 compares the current levels of
total budget authority, outlays, and reve-
nues to the overall limits filed in the Con-
gressional Record on May 10, 2018, as ad-
justed, for fiscal year 2019. These compari-
sons are needed to implement section 311(a)
of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974,
which establishes a rule enforceable with a
point of order against measures that would
breach the budget resolution’s aggregate lev-
els.
Table 2 compares the current levels of
budget authority and outlays for legislative
action completed by each authorizing com-
mittee with the limits filed in the Congres-
sional Record on May 10, 2018, as adjusted,
for fiscal year 2019. These comparisons are
needed to enforce the point of order under
section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, which prohibits the consider-
ation of measures that would breach the sec-
tion 302(a) allocation of new budget author-
ity for the committee that reported the
measure. It is also needed to implement sec-
tion 311(c), which provides an exception for
committees that comply with their alloca-
tions from the point of order under section
311(a).
Table 3 compares the current status of dis-
cretionary appropriations for fiscal year 2019

with the section 302(b) suballocations of dis-
cretionary budget authority and outlays
among Appropriations subcommittees. The
comparison is needed to enforce section
302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974
because the point of order under that section
equally applies to measures that would
breach the applicable section 302(b) sub-
allocation. The table also provides supple-
mentary information on spending authorized
in excess of the base discretionary spending
limits under section 251(b) of the Balanced
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act
of 1985.
Table 4 displays the current level of ad-
vance appropriations in fiscal year 2019 ap-
propriations bills. All of the advance appro-
priations are for accounts identified pursu-
ant to H. Res. 6 and the statement of the
Chairman published in the Congressional
Record on January 8, 2019. This table is need-
ed to enforce a rule against appropriations
bills containing advance appropriations that:
(i) are not identified in the statement of the
Chairman published in the Congressional
Record on January 8, 2019 or (ii) would cause
the aggregate amount of such appropriations
to exceed the level specified in section 103(c)
of H. Res. 6.
In addition, a letter from the Congres-
sional Budget Office is attached that sum-
marizes and compares the budget impact of
legislation enacted after the adoption of the
budget resolution against the budget resolu-
tion aggregate in force.
If you have any questions, please contact
Jennifer Wheelock or Raquel Spencer.
Sincerely,
JOHN YARMUTH,
Chairman.

n.a. = not applicable; P.L. = public law.
a Includes the budgetary effects of legislation enacted during the 115th Congress.
b Sections 1001–1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255) require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services—in particular the Food and Drug Administration and
the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Therefore, the amounts
shown in this report do not include $781 million in budget authority and $770 million in estimated outlays.
c For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the House, the resolution, as approved by the House of Representatives, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a re-
sult, amounts in this current level report do not include those items.
d The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116–5), as amended, extended several immigration programs through February 15, 2019, that would otherwise have expired at the end of fiscal year 2018. The estimated budgetary effects
of those previously enacted extensions are charged to the Committee on Appropriations, and are included in the budgetary effects of P.L. 116–6 shown in the ‘‘Appropriation Legislation’’ portion of this report. In addition, division H of P.L.
116–6 further extended those same programs through the end of fiscal year 2019. Consistent with the language in title III of division H of P.L. 116–6, and at the direction of the House Committee on the Budget, the budgetary effects of
extending those immigration programs for the remainder of the fiscal year are charged to the relevant authorizing committees, and are shown in the ‘‘Authorizing Legislation’’ portion of this report.
e In the House of Representatives, and pursuant to section 314(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, amounts designated as an emergency requirement shall not count for purposes of title III and title IV of the Congressional
Budget Act of 1974, and are excluded from current-level totals. The table below displays emergency-designated funding enacted during the 116th Congress which is excluded from current-level totals. (Those amounts do not include $1,680
million in budget authority and $25 million in outlays stemming from P.L. 115–254, which was enacted during the 115th Congress):

spending and revenue levels for fiscal year 2019; those aggregate levels were first published in the Congressional Record on May 10, 2018. P.L. 115–123 also allows the Chair of the House Committee on the Budget to revise the budg-

STATUS REPORT ON CURRENT SPENDING LEVELS
OF ON-BUDGET SPENDING AND REVENUES FOR
FY 2020
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET,
Washington, DC, October 16, 2019.
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: To facilitate appli-
cation of sections 302 and 311 of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974, I am transmitting
an updated status report on the current lev-
els of on-budget spending and revenues for
fiscal year 2020. This status report is current
through October 11, 2019. The term ‘‘current
level’’ refers to the amounts of spending and
revenues estimated for each fiscal year based
on laws enacted or awaiting the President’s
signature.
Table 1 compares the current levels of
total budget authority, outlays, and reve-
nues to the overall limits filed in the Con-
gressional Record on May 3, 2019, as ad-
justed, for fiscal year 2020 and for the 10-year
period of fiscal years 2020 through 2029. These
comparisons are needed to implement sec-
tion 311(a) of the Congressional Budget Act
of 1974, which establishes a rule enforceable
with a point of order against measures that
would breach the budget resolution’s aggre-
gate levels. The table does not show budget
authority and outlays for years after fiscal
year 2020 because appropriations for those
years have not yet been completed.
Table 2 compares the current levels of
budget authority and outlays for legislative
action completed by each authorizing com-
mittee with the limits filed in the Congres-
sional Record on May 3, 2019, for fiscal year
2020, and for the 10-year period of fiscal years
2020 through 2029. These comparisons are
needed to enforce the point of order under
section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, which prohibits the consider-
ation of measures that would breach the sec-
tion 302(a) allocation of new budget author-
ity for the committee that reported the
measure. It is also needed to implement sec-
tion 311(c), which provides an exception for
committees that comply with their alloca-
tions from the point of order under section
311(a).
Table 3 compares the current status of dis-
cretionary appropriations for fiscal year 2020
with the section 302(b) suballocations of dis-
cretionary budget authority and outlays
among Appropriations subcommittees. The
comparison is needed to enforce section
302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974
because the point of order under that section
equally applies to measures that would
breach the applicable section 302(b) sub-
allocation. The table also provides supple-
mentary information on spending authorized
in excess of the base discretionary spending
limits under section 251(b) of the Balanced
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act
of 1985.
In addition, a letter from the Congres-
sional Budget Office is attached that sum-
marizes and compares the budget impact of
legislation enacted after the adoption of the
budget resolution against the budget resolu-
tion aggregate in force.
If you have any questions, please contact
Jennifer Wheelock or Raquel Spencer.
Sincerely,
JOHN YARMUTH,
Chairman.

aster relief requirements.

PRAYER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Today’s
opening prayer will be offered by Giani
Sukhvinder Singh, of Gurdwara Phila-
delphia Sikh Society, Upper Darby,
PA.
The guest Chaplain offered the fol-
lowing prayer:
Let us pray.
‘‘One Universal Creator God. By The
Grace Of The True Guru.’’
Almighty God, we call You by many
names, but You are one. Keep Your Di-
vine Hand over the Members of this
Senate as they help steer the future of
our great Nation. Keep truth on our
tongues, love in our hearts, and sound
judgment in our minds. Remind us of
our purpose: to love and serve one an-
other and create a more peaceful world.
We ask for blessings unto all leaders
as they work for the common good.
Give all who govern this land humility
and courage, integrity, and compas-
sion. Release each one of us from ego
so that we may serve selflessly. Help us
remember that we belong to one fam-
ily.
‘‘Recognize the entire human race as
one.’’
We ask of the Almighty to also keep
watch over our Nation’s protectors who
work tirelessly, day and night, to en-
sure our safety and our freedom.
You are everywhere; all are Yours.
Whatever is seen, O God, is Your form.
My Lord, You are but one. We ask You
to bless this great Nation and its peo-

550TH BIRTHDAY OF GURU NANAK
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to
mark a very special day for the Sikh
religion and the Sikh community
across America and especially in Penn-
sylvania—specifically, the birthday of
the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak.
Guru Nanak was born into a Hindu
household in 1469 in what is now mod-
ern-day Pakistan. Guru Nanak showed
a keen interest in religion from very
early on in his life. He had a real apti-
tude in his youth for philosophizing
and writing poetry. He married, had
children, and became an accountant
like his father. Yet he always believed
in the importance of living a spiritual
life. Eventually, he underwent a pro-
found personal transformation to be-
come the religious figure and leader for
which he is recognized today.
Guru Nanak’s most famous teachings
include that there is only one God,
that people need not go through an
intermediary, such as a priest, to ac-
cess the one God, and that all people
are created equal. He preached that his
followers should meditate and remem-
ber God, that they should earn an hon-
est living, and that they should share
with those who are less fortunate than
themselves.
Guru Nanak began teaching the Sikh
faith around the year 1500, and with
around 30 million adherents, the Sikh
faith is the sixth largest religion in the
world. Approximately 700,000 Sikhs
have chosen to make their homes in
the United States. There are several
Sikh places of worship, known as
gurdwaras, in and around the Philadel-
phia area, Pittsburgh, Allentown, Erie,
and across America.
Next month, on November 12, there
will be celebrations at gurdwaras
across the globe to mark the 550th
birthday of Guru Nanak. In addition,
Sikh leaders have come to the Capitol
today to commemorate the birthday of
Guru Nanak.
A few minutes ago, a giani, or a Sikh
religious official, gave a prayer as the
Senate opened for business. I am proud
that he hails from my State of Penn-
sylvania. This evening, leaders from
the Sikh community will convene an
interfaith event to promote the peace-
ful values that all of the world’s major
religions share.
This morning, I just wanted to add
my voice to wish the Sikh community
great luck and great joy with this
event and to wish Guru Nanak a happy
550th birthday this year.
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
mentioned yesterday the contrast be-
tween our work in the Senate and what
is transpiring over in the House.
On this side of the Capitol, we are fo-
cused on working for the American
people. We are overcoming the Demo-
crats’ historic delay tactics and ob-
struction to confirm more of the Presi-
dent’s impressive nominees for the ex-
ecutive branch as well as for the judici-
ary. Later today, we will confirm a new
Secretary of the Air Force and will
then turn to several impressive nomi-
nees to district court vacancies in
order to continue our renewal of the
Federal judiciary.
We will also keep working on the ap-
propriations process and on providing
the funding our Armed Forces cer-
tainly need, and we are discussing ways
to discourage the withdrawal of U.S.
forces from the Middle East and ensure
the United States continues to provide
the essential global leadership that has
cornered ISIS and other radical Islamic
terrorists and has kept our Nation safe.
So what is going on over in the
House?
Those in the House are doubling
down on their 3-year-old obsession of
finding ways to nullify the decision the
American people made back in 2016.
Speaker PELOSI’s Democrats are block-
ing the USMCA, which is the landmark
trade deal that would create 176,000
new jobs for American workers. They
are dragging their heels on funding the
government, which is keeping our mili-
tary commanders in limbo. All of their
energy is going into this all-consuming
impeachment parade that has been
rolling on for 3 years now—ever search-
ing for a rationale.
Remember, it was literally on Inau-
guration Day of January 2017 when the
Washington Post ran this headline:
‘‘The campaign to impeach President
Trump has begun.’’ Well, the Post got
it right. Before President Trump even
took office, one prominent House Dem-
ocrat had already declared he would
not be a legitimate President. Just a
few months later, another was already
promising she would not rest until she
impeached him.
From the very beginning of this Pres-
idency, Washington Democrats have
lived in a state of denial. They have
seemed positive that some inside-the-
Beltway maneuver would save them
from the consequences of Secretary
Clinton’s defeat. They had hoped Spe-
cial Counsel Mueller’s report would
have validated their theories about the
conspiracy between the Trump cam-
paign and the Russians. They used
their minority powers in the Senate to
effectively try to nullify his Presi-
dency by obstructing even completely
uncontroversial nominees to all kinds
of government posts simply because
this President was the one who nomi-
nated them.
There have been 3 years of this. Now,
finally, Speaker PELOSI’s efforts to
hold back her leftwing caucus have of-
ficially crumbled, and the House has
thrown itself into impeachment.
Given the lip service the House
Democrats pay in defending the norms
and institutions of American Govern-
ment, you might think they would at
least run this so-called impeachment
inquiry by the book. You might think
the people who are trying to overrule
the American voters and, from Wash-
ington, cancel out an election would
conduct their process by the very high-
est standards of fairness and due proc-
ess.
If you thought that, you would be
wrong. Our Democratic colleagues have
had their minds made up since long be-
fore this inquiry began. Remember, the
chairwoman of one of the committees
Speaker PELOSI put in charge of the
process said in April of 2017: ‘‘I’m going
to fight every day until he’s im-
peached.’’ That was back in 2017. So
this is not about seriously discharging
constitutional responsibilities. It is
about the end result they have had in
mind since day one.
Remember when the campaign to
block Justice Kavanaugh began with
protest signs with a big, empty blank
for the name? It was a fill-in-the-blank
protest before they even knew who the
nominee was. Now we have the sequel
with this fill-in-the-blank quest for im-
peachment. The Democrats’ process al-
ready speaks for itself.
For the first time ever, Speaker
PELOSI has simply ordered the House to
conduct an inquiry into impeaching a
President without a full vote of the
House. Just yesterday, the Speaker
doubled down on this unprecedented
and undemocratic process by once
again refusing to hold a vote on an im-
peachment inquiry.
Democrats have refused to give Re-
publicans the same rights and fair
treatment that Republicans afforded
Democrats during the Clinton impeach-
ment—things like equal subpoena
power for the ranking members. Like-
wise, Democrats have refused to give
President Trump’s counsel the same
opportunities that Republicans gave to
President Clinton—rights such as at-
tending all hearings, depositions, offer-
ing evidence, and cross-examining wit-
nesses.
We have already seen Chairman
SCHIFF say in public that his com-
mittee had not been in touch with the
whistleblower when they actually had
been. We have seen Chairman SCHIFF
bizarrely and brazenly fabricate what
the President actually said to the
President of Ukraine during an official
hearing that he was chairing, only to
claim that his fabrications were a par-
ody—a parody—when Republicans
called him out for it.
The same Democrats who are run-
ning this circus turn around and claim
with a straight face that they are sol-
emnly following the facts and the Con-
stitution wherever it leads.
Give me a break. Give me a break.
The entire country can see that that is
not what is happening here.
And here is what else the American
people can see: The Democrats would
rather fight with the White House than
work with the Republicans and the ad-
ministration to pass legislation.
We need real solutions, like full-year
funding for our Armed Forces so our
men and women in uniform can receive
their pay raise and our commanders
can engage in long-term planning; real
solutions like the USMCA, the major
victory for American workers and
American businesses that the Trump
administration negotiated with Canada
and Mexico but which Speaker PELOSI
has blocked for months, with 176,000
new American jobs hanging in the bal-
ance.
Opportunities are right before us.
Senate Republicans have been ready
and waiting for weeks and months to
do our part and actually make law on
these subjects for the benefit of Amer-
ican families. We just need our coun-
terparts across the Capitol to get seri-
ous about this.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, just
when you think things couldn’t get any
stranger here in Washington, DC, a few
weeks ago, Speaker PELOSI announced
that the House was officially beginning
proceedings to impeach the President
of the United States. While the left has
been dreaming of impeachment ever
since the President was first elected in
2016, the timing of this was quite a sur-
prise. In fact, last January the Speaker
led the effort to table an impeachment
resolution, and she and Chairman NAD-
LER and Chairman SCHIFF and other
House leaders had said that they recog-
nized that this would never be success-
ful unless it is bipartisan, and I think
they were right then and they are
wrong now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5807
October 16, 2019
We know that the announcement of
the Speaker came at a time when the
only thing the public knew was about
rumors of a whistleblower complaint
about a call over which virtually no
one knew any details.
But the facts didn’t really matter.
This was about grabbing ahold of some-
thing and using this as a vehicle to do
what the left has wanted to do since
the President was inaugurated.
Were the initial reports a reason to
look into the matter further? Abso-
lutely. That is what the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence that I have
the privilege of serving on did. We had
the Acting Director of National Intel-
ligence come testify. We had the in-
spector general come testify about his
report.
But that is not the approach that
House Democrats have taken. They
made no honest effort to investigate
before deciding to impeach.
Prior to the Speaker’s press con-
ference, in fact, we hadn’t seen the
complaint. We hadn’t seen the tran-
script or heard from the leaders of the
intelligence community. But regard-
less of the lack of any evidence at the
time, they jumped into impeachment
feet first. It is almost as if they were
waiting for anything—any excuse, any
reason at all—to do what they have
wanted to do since day one in opposing
President Trump.
This confirms to me that this is real-
ly not about the facts so much as it is
a search-and-destroy mission.
Removing a President from office is
no small matter. In fact, the Senate
has never done so in American history.
You would think that with so much at
stake, our House Democrat friends
would make every effort to lay out a
careful, logical, fact-based case for the
American people.
In fact, they said they knew they
couldn’t be successful unless this was a
bipartisan effort, but they made zero
effort to make it bipartisan by laying
out the facts, by making it trans-
parent, by letting the American people
see exactly what was going on.
Ordinarily, you would expect hear-
ings on every major network, witnesses
presenting their testimony, subject to
questioning by both Republicans and
Democrats, and detailed reports of in-
vestigations. That is what you would
expect, but that is not what we got.
Instead, we got secret hearings, se-
cret witnesses, secret interviews, and
secret meetings. But you know what
goes along with that kind of secrecy—
leaks and more leaks.
Chairman SCHIFF and his cohorts in
the House have drawn the cloak of se-
crecy around this entire proceeding
and then proceeded to drip, drip, drip a
narrative to the press through leaks
that would seem to justify their argu-
ments, but that is not fair. That is not
fair to the President. That is not fair
to the 65 million American people who
voted for President Trump. To try to
negate an election through this sort of
inappropriate process just defies logic
and sense.
We have some idea of whom they are
meeting with, but we have no idea as
to the details they are talking about.
That is because, instead of going
through the Judiciary Committee,
which would have been an open pro-
ceeding, ordinarily, Speaker PELOSI
has grabbed this topic from Chairman
NADLER and given it to Chairman
SCHIFF, the chairman of the House In-
telligence Committee, so as to have
some sort of justification, as thin as it
may seem, for doing things behind
closed doors and in secret.
As I said, I am on the Senate Intel-
ligence Committee. I understand that
if there is classified information that
can’t be made public, that is a reason
to have closed-door hearings, but there
should be some effort to separate the
classified information, if there is any,
from the nonclassified information and
have a public hearing on that part of
the information the committee is
given, not just closing the door, lock-
ing it, and throwing away the key, and
keeping it all secret. This is really un-
justified.
Well, we know that they have been
busy. Chairman SCHIFF has been busy.
We know he has been particularly busy
on the TV talk shows and giving inter-
views to the media all day long, every
day, and we know that there are bits of
information being strategically leaked
to the media, which conveniently align
with their overall plan, and that is im-
peachment.
There have been no real and credible
details about what has happened be-
hind those closed-door meetings, and I
would suggest that every American
should be concerned. This is entirely
contrary to our basic concepts of fair-
ness and due process—to have secret
witnesses, secret interviews, secret
hearings, and then use that informa-
tion to take one of the most dramatic
actions that the Constitution provides
for, and that is the removal of a Presi-
dent.
This is contrary to any concept of
fair play and due process, as guaran-
teed by the Bill of Rights and our Con-
stitution. You could be charged with a
traffic offense and get more trans-
parency and more due process than
what the House Democrats are pro-
viding to President Trump, because
that is what the Constitution requires.
Because the Speaker made a decision
to impeach President Trump based at
the time solely on rumors and second-
hand information, I am left with very
little optimism for the way this im-
peachment inquiry so far has been han-
dled.
Now, there have been some silly
hearings in the House of Representa-
tives this year, but the American peo-
ple should have the benefit of being
able to watch these proceedings and
draw their own conclusions. They don’t
have to believe what the press tells
them based on strategic leaks. They
don’t have to believe what Chairman
SCHIFF and Speaker PELOSI say. They
can judge the facts for themselves.
When it comes to impeachment, ar-
guably one of the most serious respon-
sibilities under our Constitution for
Congress, House Democrats have sim-
ply drawn the cloak of secrecy around
their investigation. Of course, you
know what the logical questions are to
this sort of bizarre proceeding—ques-
tions like this: What are they hiding?
What are they afraid of? What is it
that they don’t want the American
people to see?
Of course, as I said, there are going
to be some sensitivities and, perhaps,
even some classified information, par-
ticularly when you are talking about
foreign policy.
But the President has already made
the key documents public. He has de-
classified the conversation he had with
President Zelensky, and we have seen
the report of the inspector general.
This secrecy veil seems to be more of
a necessary tool to cloak information
that doesn’t align with their narrative.
They simply don’t want people to hear
all sides of the story.
I have no doubt that if the facts were
on their side, they would allow this
process to be in the open. If they actu-
ally thought that transparency would
benefit them, they would throw the
doors wide open and do it out in public
and let the American people judge it
for themselves, and if facts were on
their side, they would then hold a vote
on the floor of the House of Represent-
atives authorizing this impeachment
inquiry, which has been done each time
in the past. But from what we read,
Speaker PELOSI is trying to protect her
vulnerable House Members from being
held accountable for their vote, par-
ticularly those in swing districts that
won in 2018. So this is more another
part of the political calculation at
work here.
Instead, what they are doing is con-
structing this narrative behind closed
doors and handpicking which informa-
tion to leak and which to keep secret.
A true and honest investigation
means following the facts where they
may lead, gathering evidence, and giv-
ing the American people access to that
information at every step, but that is a
far cry from what is happening today.
While House Democrats are freely
leaking the details of the impeachment
process to the media, they are being
unfair to the American people, particu-
larly the 65 million people who voted
for President Trump in the first place—
but not just them. We all understand
that in elections you win some and you
lose some. Even the people who didn’t
vote for President Trump, I believe,
would be committed to a fair process,
particularly when going through some-
thing as serious as the potential im-
peachment and removal of a duly elect-
ed President of the United States.
What they want to do is to undo the
2016 election, but they should at least
have the courage to do it out in the
open.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5808 October 16, 2019
We know what is happening as a re-
sult of the Democrats devoting 100 per-
cent of their time and energy to revers-
ing the results of the 2016 election by
impeaching President Trump. Their
constituents sitting at home are won-
dering what it is they are actually
going to be able to accomplish.
When we have elections, ordinarily
candidates run for office and say: If
you elect me, I will do this, this, and
this. The House Democrats have given
up on that. Forget their campaign
promises. Forget what they told their
voters in the 2018 election. They are all
in on the impeachment and removal of
the President. The rest of that stuff is
just talk—at least that is how it ap-
pears.
There are a lot of important things
we can and should be doing in Wash-
ington as opposed to this political side
show. We have had many productive
hearings and efforts on such important
items as trying to reduce mass vio-
lence, which is something we are all
concerned about, how to bring down
costs and increase choice when it
comes to our healthcare system, how
to improve trade so we can sell the
things we grow and make in America
to markets around the world, and how
we can continue this incredible trend
line when it comes to our economy,
where unemployment is at historically
low levels and particularly African-
American and Hispanic unemployment
is at historically the lowest level in re-
corded history. Forget all of that.
House Democrats are full steam ahead
on impeachment, which will make it
virtually impossible for us to pass pro-
ductive, bipartisan legislation. It will
make it virtually impossible for them
to keep the promises they themselves
made to their constituents when they
ran for election in 2018, and that is a
crying shame.
This is the final point I want to
make. We are 13 months—13 months—
from a general election. President
Trump will be on the ballot. These
folks, who apparently have never got-
ten over their loss in 2016, will have a
chance to cast their votes again. So
will the American people. We will be
able to take a look at the Democratic
nominee, along with President Trump,
the Republican nominee, and we will be
able to vote 13 months from now. But,
to me, it says the Democrats are not
particularly optimistic about the out-
come of the 2020 election, given that
choice, because they are not going to
wait for the election to occur; they
want to divide the country, they want
to paralyze Congress, and they want to
impeach President Trump 13 months
before the election.
I hope cooler heads will prevail.
Democrats should work with us to pass
bipartisan legislation that will actu-
ally make our country better off rather
than pursuing this purely political
agenda of impeachment.
I think it is disgraceful the way the
House Democrats have chosen to pur-
sue this clandestine impeachment
process rather than focus on what is
best for the American people. Let the
voters cast their ballots 13 months
from now rather than put our country
through this divisive and ultimately
futile effort to impeach and remove
President Trump.
Mr. President, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri.
CONGRATULATING THE ST. LOUIS BLUES
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to
talk about a very different topic, and
that is the Stanley Cup. Yesterday at
the White House, the St. Louis Blues
were warmly welcomed by the Presi-
dent in a ceremony celebrating their
Stanley Cup victory. On June 12, the
Blues made history when they defeated
the Boston Bruins in game 7 of the
Stanley Cup Final.
It was hard to imagine at the begin-
ning of this season that the Blues could
have done this. They were the lowest
ranked team in the National Hockey
League. I think there was a time in the
month of January when the odds that
the Blues would win the Stanley Cup
were 150 to 1. I am not particularly a
betting man, but knowing what I know
now, we wouldn’t have had to put much
money on that bet to have won a sig-
nificant amount of money. As it turned
out, however, as you and I know in
what we do here and what we have done
in our lives, the odds are not really
what count; what counts is how you
play the season. Just like we often say
in politics, candidates matter. In hock-
ey, in sports, the players matter. How
they come together as a team matters.
Whether or not that team really be-
comes a team matters, and this one
did.
It was a season for the Blues that was
filled with record-breaking achieve-
ments. Jordan Binnington became the
first and only rookie goalie to win 16
games in the Stanley Cup playoffs.
Ryan O’Reilly set a franchise record
with 23 points in the playoffs and was
named the postseason most valuable
player. Game 7 of the Stanley Cup
Final was the most watched NHL game
in 36 years.
For the first time in franchise his-
tory, the Blues brought the Stanley
Cup trophy to Missouri to celebrate
their achievement as the best sports
fans in Missouri stepped out. Five hun-
dred thousand people were there when
the Stanley Cup parade was in St.
Louis for the first time. Five hundred
thousand people—in several States rep-
resented on the floor, that would be ev-
erybody in the State. Five hundred
thousand is a pretty big crowd any-
where, as it was in St. Louis that day.
Today, the Stanley Cup trophy will
be on display on Capitol Hill so that
Blues fans in the area can get a chance
to see this legendary trophy in person.
The Stanley Cup has already traveled
all over the world since the Blues won
the Stanley Cup. Ryan O’Reilly
brought the Cup to Ontario to share it
with his 99-year-old grandmother, who
is probably one of the oldest people to
see the Stanley Cup. But for sure the
youngest baby to be put in the Stanley
Cup—the record was broken when the
trophy was brought to a mother and
her newborn child at Mercy Hospital in
St. Louis, the baby barely born, right
there in the Stanley Cup, setting the
new Stanley Cup ‘‘youngest baby in the
Cup’’ record.
We will never forget the image of
Laila Anderson. Laila, a young girl
battling a life-threatening disease, in
many ways became the No. 1 fan of the
team. Laila, by the way, was at the
White House in the Rose Garden yes-
terday, and she was called up to stand
by the President and the Stanley Cup,
with the team surrounding both of
them. The night they won, she was on
the ice with the players celebrating as
the Stanley Cup was passed around at
the end of game 7.
The day after the Blues received
their championship rings, two players
visited Laila to personally deliver her
very own ring. I saw those rings yester-
day, and they are just about as big as
Laila’s hand. They were big rings. Her
name was inscribed on the diamond-
studded championship ring that was
given to her, which also included the
words ‘‘Play Gloria,’’ which became the
theme song, fight song, inspirational
song for the Blues at the end of the
season.
Blues fans have plenty to be excited
about this season. The majority of the
names of the players that are now
etched on the Stanley Cup are back
this year. The roster is even better
with the addition of defenseman Justin
Faulk.
We are also proud to say that St.
Louis will host the 2020 NHL All-Star
Game in January. That game, of
course, brings together the most tal-
ented players in professional hockey. I
know St. Louis is ready to welcome
them, and we will all be excited to fur-
ther solidify St. Louis’s place as one of
the great sports cities in America.
It has been a great year for Blues
fans, and I hope the team will once
again have the opportunity to visit the
White House next year. This will be the
first year of many years where those of
us in the Missouri delegation will get
to host the Stanley Cup in the Capitol.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5809
October 16, 2019
a foreign leader to intervene in an
American election on his behalf. The
facts that are already in the public do-
main are so deeply troubling and must
be taken very seriously. I know that
our colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives did not run for office to
begin an impeachment inquiry, but
this task was thrust upon them by the
President’s alleged conduct and the de-
mands of the Constitution of our Re-
public.
Here in the Senate, our job is even
more austere. We are assigned the
power not only to examine the evi-
dence but to render judgment. We all
have a solemn duty to follow the facts
impartially and let ourselves be gov-
erned by reason, rather than by passion
or by politics. That role means that we
have a responsibility to behave impar-
tially, in a nonpartisan manner from
the outset. As my friend Leader
MCCONNELL said during the 1998 im-
peachment debate, ‘‘it’s been my view
that I don’t, as a potential juror, if it’s
serious enough to warrant a potential
impeachment proceeding, I don’t think
I ought to pre-judge the case.’’
Yet already a few of my Senate Re-
publican colleagues seem determined
to turn this serious inquiry into an-
other partisan exercise. My friend the
Republican leader, here on the floor
yesterday, made the sadly predictable
attack of calling the work of the ma-
jority in the House partisan. Another
of my colleagues, Senator GRAHAM,
said he was trying to organize a letter
of Senate Republicans promising they
would not vote to convict the Presi-
dent before the House even completes
its inquiry—before any articles of im-
peachment are even drafted, let alone
voted on, before a scrap of evidence was
considered in the Senate trial, if it
comes to that. Senator GRAHAM seems
to be advocating ‘‘Alice in Wonder-
land’’ justice—first the verdict, then
the trial. I hope he will rethink that.
Over the State work period, the Re-
publican leader ran an advertisement
in which he declared: ‘‘The way that
impeachment stops is a Senate major-
ity with me as majority leader.’’ That
is a far cry from what he said in 1998:
‘‘not prejudging the case.’’
We are several steps away from a po-
tential trial in the Senate. The House
continues to do its work diligently,
even handedly, with only the facts in
mind. So I remind my Republican col-
leagues in this Chamber that commit-
ting today to vote not guilty is con-
trary to their oath to do impartial jus-
tice. That is their oath. Instead of pre-
judging, I remind my Republican col-
leagues in this body that you have a re-
sponsibility to put country over party.
Our national security, the rule of law,
and our democracy are at stake.
TURKEY AND SYRIA
Mr. President, we are witnessing in
realtime the collapse of American for-
eign policy in the Middle East. Five
years of hard fighting in Syria to first
destabilize and then to degrade ISIS
has potentially been undone in one
phone call. The President’s abrupt de-
cision to withdraw U.S. forces has
abandoned the field to our enemies—
ISIS, Iran, Putin, and Bashar al-
Assad—and it has put our friends in
danger, including two of the closest
friends we have in the Middle East, the
Syrian Kurds and Israel.
I want to be very clear. The Presi-
dent’s decision poses a threat to our
national security here in the United
States. By green-lighting President
Erdogan’s operation and abandoning
the Syrian Kurds to face the onslaught
on their own, the President has made
an already fragile situation in northern
Syria more dangerous and handed a
‘‘get out of jail free’’ card to poten-
tially more than 10,000 ISIS fighters.
ISIS has threatened the United States
and our allies repeatedly, taken Ameri-
cans hostages and executed them, and
will undoubtedly continue to threaten
our security if they experience a resur-
gence.
We New Yorkers know best, unfortu-
nately, how a small group of fanatics
half a world away can do incredible
damage and kill thousands of Ameri-
cans here on our soil. Now, with ISIS
prisoners escaping, unfortunately, the
chances of that are increasing, not just
according to me but to an expert like
General Mattis.
Make no mistake. The President’s in-
competence has put American lives in
danger. Today, the House of Represent-
atives will consider a resolution that
condemns the President’s decision and
demands that he reverse course. It
should pass with bipartisan support
and should be the first order of busi-
ness for us here in the Senate—the first
order of business. Sanctions against
Erdogan are fine and good. President
Erdogan should be punished for his
military adventurism and his aggres-
sion, but sanctions alone are insuffi-
cient, and they are particularly insuffi-
cient in regard to ISIS. Sanctions will
not put ISIS fighters back on the run
or back in their cells. They will not
stop Iran and Putin’s growing influence
in the region, nor will they undo Amer-
ica’s betrayal of our partners and al-
lies. Sanctions can be an effective tool,
but they are not the only tool, espe-
cially when the crisis in this case is of
the President’s own making. The sim-
plest and most effective remedy would
be for the President to admit his mis-
take and correct course.
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. President, earlier this summer,
both Houses of Congress and the White
House arrived at a budget agreement
that gave us a blueprint for funding the
government, but in September, Repub-
licans unilaterally walked away from
our agreement and proposed taking $12
billion from domestic programs—in-
cluding Head Start, HHS, and even the
Pentagon—to fund the President’s bor-
der wall. This is a nonstarter. There
aren’t enough votes in the Chamber to
pass it.
As we look to get the appropriations
back on track, I was disappointed that
Senate Republicans let the entire State
work period pass without responding to
Democratic offers. Instead of spending
that time negotiating with House
Democrats on allocations, Senate Re-
publicans have sat on their hands, and
now we are back in session this week
at the same impasse. Republicans are
insisting on the same thing they un-
successfully shut down the government
for last year: $12 billion for a border
wall that President Trump promised
Mexico would pay for.
If Senate Republicans don’t wake up
and resume good-faith negotiations
with Democrats, I fear we are headed
down the same road.
PENSIONS
Mr. President, for decades, millions
of Americans labored in construction
and mining and truck driving and
other industries with the promise of a
secure retirement when they reached
old age through their pension. But
through no fault of their own, forces
like a financial crisis, a dwindling
labor force, and inaction on the part of
the Federal Government, their pension
plans are now at risk of becoming in-
solvent within a decade. This is an im-
mediate problem. It is going to destroy
the security of millions of retirees—
people who worked all their lives. They
put a little bit of money away that
they could have spent when they need-
ed it, but they put it in for their retire-
ment hoping that the day they retire
they wouldn’t become rich, but at least
they could live decently. Now that may
be vanished—vanished. Congress has
the power to stop this problem dead in
its tracks. Just 2 months ago, the
House passed the Butch Lewis Act,
which would provide immediate relief
to ‘‘critical and declining’’ pension
plans so we can keep our promise to
our workers. Leader MCCONNELL and
Senate Republicans, once again,
inexplicably, have refused to take ac-
tion on this bipartisan legislation. Sen-
ate Republicans blocked us from even
debating it last night. So in a short
time, I will join my colleagues, includ-
ing Senators BROWN, STABENOW,
MANCHIN, MURRAY, and WYDEN to de-
mand that Leader MCCONNELL allow us
a vote on legislation to protect these
millions of workers and secure the re-
tirements they have earned.
President Trump often claims to be
looking out for the American worker,
but his policies set them further and
further adrift. This one is notorious.
Retirement, a decent retirement, is
part of the American dream and part of
the American way. Here is a chance for
President Trump to actually defend
American workers instead of hurting
them.
If President Trump is truly the
champion of the American worker, he
will prevail on our Republican col-
leagues to start working with Demo-
crats to make sure—make sure—we
protect the pensions that millions of
families rely on for their security and
have paid for.
I yield the floor.

Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask

NOMINATION OF BARBARA MCCONNELL BARRETT
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, later
today, the Senate will vote to confirm
Barbara Barrett as Secretary of the Air
Force. I have come to the floor directly
from a meeting with her this morning.
Ambassador Barrett has had an im-
pressive career both inside and outside
of government. Among other things,
she has served as U.S. Ambassador to
Finland, Deputy Administrator of the
FAA, and as a member of the Civil Aer-
onautics Board. Most importantly, she
has a deep understanding of the U.S.
Air Force, thanks to her work as a ci-
vilian adviser to the Secretary of De-
fense and the Joint Chiefs.
As a member of the Defense Advisory
Committee on women in the services,
she fought to expand opportunities for
women in the military. She became the
first civilian woman to land an F–18 on
an aircraft carrier, which was part of a
mission to demonstrate women’s fit-
ness to fly in combat. Thanks, in part,
to her work in 1993, the military
changed its regulations to allow
women to fly combat aircraft.
I am always particularly interested
in making sure we have an outstanding
Air Force Secretary because my State
of South Dakota is lucky enough to
play host to Ellsworth Air Force Base,
home of the 28th Bomb Wing and future
home of the B–21 bomber.
Over the State work period in Octo-
ber, I was able to visit Ellsworth to sit
down with the new commander of the
28th Bomb Wing, Col. David Doss, as
well as CCM Rochelle Hemingway. We
had a great discussion, and we had a
chance to talk about the needs of the
base going forward, including what will
be needed as Ellsworth prepares to
serve as the first home of the B–21.
Ensuring that the base has the nec-
essary resources and infrastructure to
fully support the B–21 mission will be a
priority of mine not just as we await
the mission but for decades to come.
Since I came to Congress, I have
worked with the base and the Greater
Rapid City community to build up Ells-
worth. We have gone from fighting to
keep the base open, to adding an MQ–9
Reaper mission and supporting the B–1
as a workhorse of the bomber fleet, to
hosting the largest training airspace in
the continental United States, and to
being chosen to host both the B–21
training mission and first operational
squadron.
I am incredibly proud of all that Ells-
worth airmen have accomplished, and I
am looking forward to seeing every-
thing the team at the base will be able
to do in the future.
TURKEY AND SYRIA
Madam President, as I reflect on the
critical role our military plays in the
world, I want to take a moment to talk
about what is happening in Syria right
now and the U.S. response.
This is a complex situation. Given its
proximity to several fronts of conflict
and unrest, Turkey is facing immense
pressure to address security concerns
and is straining to support a huge num-
ber of refugees.
Turkey also has an understandable
interest in rooting out terrorists with-
in its country and stemming any fac-
tions that support them, but the Kurd-
ish militias the United States has
backed in Syria are not the same as
the group Turkey has struggled to con-
tain in its own country.
Turkey’s decision to attack Kurdish
forces in Syria will do nothing but ex-
acerbate the humanitarian crisis on
the border. It will also strengthen the
Assad regime and foster greater influ-
ence in the region by Russia and Iran.
Most alarmingly, Turkey’s incursion
will force the Kurds to pull resources
that would otherwise be committed to
keeping ISIS fighters imprisoned. It is
deeply concerning that the withdrawal
of U.S. forces has set this into motion.
As you know, a major reason for
ISIS’s rise was President Obama’s deci-
sion to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq
on a timetable that he announced to
our enemies and before the security
situation was stable. The departure of
U.S. forces created a vacuum in the re-
gion that ISIS quickly stepped in to
fill. It is important that we don’t allow
history to repeat itself.
U.S. and Kurdish forces have been
working together against ISIS for
years now and have succeeded in dras-
tically shrinking ISIS’s territory and
weakening this terrorist organization.
Thanks to their work, in many re-
spects ISIS can be said to be on the
run, but this achievement could quick-
ly be undone by a U.S. withdrawal from
the country.
I hope we will be able to have some
fruitful discussions here in Washington
this week about the need to maintain
our strategic gains against ISIS and
avoid creating a vacuum for our en-
emies to fill, and I hope our NATO ally
Turkey is listening closely.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
IMMIGRATION
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I
rise today on the Senate floor to ad-
dress an issue that is really funda-
mental to who we are as Americans. It
is the issue of immigration.
We just celebrated, this past week, a
day dedicated to Christopher Colum-
bus, who, supposedly, discovered Amer-
ica. Of course, we know better. Native
Americans were here and discovered it
before him, but he was the first Euro-
pean to discover America and really
triggered an immigration to this part
of the world that has really changed
America and the world forever.
This immigration from all over the
world has created one of the most di-
verse nations on Earth. I am a bene-
ficiary of that immigration. My moth-
er was an immigrant to America in
1911, coming here from Lithuania to
East St. Louis, IL, where she was
raised and where I had the chance to
grow up, as well.
Today, her son—this immigrant
mother’s son—has been serving as a
U.S. Senator from Illinois with humil-
ity and pride. It is an indication of our
family’s story, but it is also America’s
story—how immigrants came from far
and wide to America and made lives
and great futures and built families
that continue to serve this Nation to
this day.
You would think, since immigration
is such a central part of who we are as
Americans, that there would be a gen-
eral consensus about the issue, but it
turns out to be one of the most hotly
contested and debated issues almost
since the arrival of the Mayflower.
How many people should be allowed
to come to this country? Where are
they going to come from? What will
they do when they come here? What
impact will they have on those of us
who are already here? All of these
questions of national security have led
us into an ongoing national debate
about immigration.
Today, this morning, I come to the
floor to discuss one aspect of it. This
last Sunday morning, I was back in Il-
linois and was invited to a Democratic
Party event in Schaumburg, IL. It was
a fairly routine breakfast meeting of
the Democratic township organization.
I have been to many of them. It is
great to see old friends.
When I arrived at the event, I was
surprised to see demonstrators, pro-
testers—perhaps 200 of them—holding
signs with my name on them. It is not
exactly the way you want to start a
Sunday morning, greeting 200 people
with signs about this fellow named
Durbin. I had a chance to talk to them.
I didn’t run away from them because I
wanted to find out who they were and
why they were there.
By and large, they were people from
India who are currently living in the
United States and want to become
legal citizens here. Most of them came
to the United States bringing special
skills that were needed. Many of them
are in the Silicon Valley high-tech in-
dustries—engineers who came to the
United States once companies certified
that they couldn’t find an American to
fill the job, which is a requirement.
Having been unable to find an Amer-
ican, these companies asked permis-
sion to bring in these highly skilled
people from India to serve as engineers
in the United States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5811
October 16, 2019
They come in on what is known as H–
1B visas, by and large, and that allows
them to work in the United States for
several years and to renew that work
status on a recurring basis. But there
reached a point where they wanted to
stay here. They have lived here awhile.
They bring their families and raise
their families here, and they want to
become part of America’s future. They
apply for what is known as an employ-
ment-based immigrant visa, which
leads to a green card. A green card is
the ticket to legal, permanent resi-
dency, which can lead to citizenship.
So these people from India, who were
waiting to see me and say a few words
to me, stated the fact that the waiting
list for those in this category from
India has now passed 520,000. There are
520,000 who are seeking permanent sta-
tus in our country.
I met one of them from my home-
town of Springfield, IL, a young Indian
physician who is serving at one of our
hospitals in Springfield. He brought
with him his daughter. His daughter is
12 years old. He is worried because if
he, the physician who came here to
work from India, is not allowed to le-
gally stay in this country and his
daughter reaches the age of 21, her sta-
tus changes. She is no longer his de-
pendent. She now has her own immi-
gration status, and she is not tech-
nically, legally, beyond the age of 21,
allowed to stay in this country.
So he says to me: Here is my daugh-
ter, who has been here for 10 years.
This is the country she knows and
loves and wants to be a part of, and if
I don’t get approval to stay as a doctor
in this country, she is technically un-
documented at that point, and we run
into problems with the future.
For example, it is no surprise that
this doctor wants to see his daughter
go to college. Well, his daughter, un-
documented, will not qualify for any
assistance in the United States by way
of Pell grants or loans. How is she
going to pay for college? Where would
she go? Our immigration system says,
at that point, if her father doesn’t
reach this green card status, she would
return to India, a place she maybe
never remembers and that was part of
her infancy in her early time here on
Earth.
So it is a complicated situation.
There is a debate under way here about
how to stop this backlog of people who
are waiting in line 10 years, 20 years,
and more to reach green card status.
You can imagine the uncertainty in
their lives, the uncertainty for their
children, and why they are looking for
some relief.
I came to this issue never dreaming
that I would end up being in the middle
of most debates in the Senate on immi-
gration, but I welcome it because it is
such an important issue and because I
have strong feelings myself about
America’s immigration policy.
I serve as the ranking member of the
Subcommittee on Border Security and
Immigration for the Senate Judiciary
Committee. As I have said, my own
personal family and life experience
have really made me warm to the sub-
ject, and I try to learn as much as I can
about a complex field. Make no mis-
take, the immigration system of the
United States of America is badly,
badly broken. How to fix it is hotly de-
bated here in the Senate and in the
House and across the Nation.
Last night, when I was watching the
Presidential debates, groups were run-
ning ads on a regular basis on the issue
of immigration. Many believe that it is
going to be a hot topic in the 2020 elec-
tion. It is quite possible that it will be.
We know that in State legislatures and
city halls, on cable news and social
media, and almost everywhere, there is
a debate under way about immigration.
But there is one place where there is no
debate about immigration—here in the
U.S. Senate.
This year, we had one hearing in the
Border Security and Immigration Sub-
committee. And the Senate Judiciary
Committee voted on only one immigra-
tion bill. The chairman limited debate
to only one hour and didn’t allow any
amendments, and we have not had any
debates on the floor of the Senate.
I look to the Galleries and the people
who come to the Senate and expect to
see a debate on an issue—an important
issue. Here is one: immigration. But all
they have is a speech from this Senator
and a few others, instead of addressing
the issue of immigration.
Senator KENNEDY has come to the
floor, and I am going to make a unani-
mous consent request in just a few
minutes. He is a member of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, too, and I think
he appreciates, as I do, what a great
honor it is to serve on this storied com-
mittee. But the fact is that to have the
titles of Judiciary Committee and Bor-
der Security and Immigration Sub-
committee and to do nothing, I think,
is a dereliction of duty.
We are supposed to step up and de-
bate these things and come to the best
bipartisan conclusion we can to solve
problems in this country. Here is a
problem we are not solving: how to
deal with a backlog of people, highly
skilled and important people, like the
doctor from my hometown of Spring-
field, from India, who wants to have a
green card, giving him an opportunity
to become an American citizen.
Do you know what? I want that doc-
tor to become an American citizen. I
want him to get a green card. We need
him in my hometown and many more
just like him, and I want his family to
be there with him so that his life is
complete as he pursues his professional
responsibilities.
Now, in recent weeks, there has been
an effort to pass a bill to address this
issue. The bill is S. 386. It is known as
the Fairness for High-Skilled Immi-
grants Act. Unfortunately, there was
an effort to pass it without any debate
or a chance to even offer an amend-
ment.
Now, this bill makes significant
changes in our immigration laws, but
there has never been a hearing on the
bill or a vote in the committee. The
lead sponsor of the legislation is MIKE
LEE, who is the senior Senator from
Utah and a personal friend. He has ne-
gotiated several amendments in pri-
vate with his Republican Senators, but
there has been no conversation with
myself or any other Democratic Sen-
ators about these negotiations.
That is not how the Senate should
work. I believe I have seen the Senate
at its best, and, unfortunately, it was 7
years ago. We decided—eight of us in
the Senate, four Democrats and four
Republicans—to actually sit down and
try to fix the immigration system. It is
a pretty ambitious task, but we had
some pretty talented people engaged in
it. Leading on the Republican side was
John McCain from Arizona. Next to
him was LINDSEY GRAHAM from South
Carolina, Jeff Flake from Arizona, and
MARCO RUBIO from Florida.
On our side, I was engaged with Sen-
ator CHUCK SCHUMER, who is now the
Democrat Senate leader, as well as BOB
MENENDEZ, of course, a Hispanic Sen-
ator from the State of New Jersey, and
MICHAEL BENNET from Colorado.
So the eight of us came together. We
did what I think the Senate is supposed
to do. We sat down and took our time
and spent months, every single week,
sometimes several evenings each week,
going through a different section of our
immigration law and trying to make it
work, reform it, and change it. It took
us months—some 6 months of meet-
ings. That is what we are elected to do.
We produced a comprehensive immi-
gration reform bill that was supported
by virtually everyone. Groups of busi-
ness leaders, as well as groups of labor
leaders, the church community, and all
sorts of people from the conservative
side of politics to the liberal side of
politics said that this was a good, fair,
bipartisan compromise.
So in 2013, we reported this bill to the
floor, after our Democratic Judiciary
Committee chairman at that time,
PATRICK LEAHY from Vermont, had a
lengthy hearing. We considered over
100 amendments—amendments offered
by those who were voting against the
bill, like Jeff Sessions from Alabama,
and amendments offered by those sup-
porting the bill, like MAZIE HIRONO
from Hawaii. Each person offered an
amendment, debated it, and we voted.
It sounded like the U.S. Senate; didn’t
it? We were actually voting on amend-
ments on a critically important bill.
Thanks to Chairman LEAHY’s skill and
patience, I might add, after hundreds of
amendments were considered, the bill
was reported out of the Senate Judici-
ary Committee, came to the floor of
the Senate in 2013, and we called for a
vote. It passed 68 to 32. After all that
work, on a bipartisan basis, we finally
got it right. I thought we did, and I
voted for it.
Sadly, that bill was sent across the
Rotunda, over to the House of Rep-
resentatives, as the Constitution re-
quires, and, unfortunately, the Repub-
lican Speaker, John Boehner, refused

to call the bill or debate an alternative
to it. It literally died from lack of any
effort to deal with the issue in the U.S.
House of Representatives.
So one would ask—that was more
than 6 years ago—what has happened
since? The answer is nothing—virtually
nothing—except decisions by the
Trump administration, for example, to
eliminate some aspects of our immi-
gration law, like the DACA provision.
Madam President, I ask unanimous
consent for 3 additional minutes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. DURBIN. In light of an attempt
to pass the Fairness for High-Skilled
Immigrants Act without hearings or
debate, I come to the floor today to
present an alternative. I am intro-
ducing the Resolving Extended Limbo
for Immigrant Employees and Families
Act, known as the RELIEF Act, which
will treat all immigrants fairly by
eliminating immigrant visa backlogs.
One of the most serious problems of
our immigration system is that there
are not enough immigrant visas,
known as green cards. As a result, im-
migrants are stuck in crippling back-
logs for decades. Close to 4 million fu-
ture Americans, many of whom already
live and work in the United States, are
on the State Department’s immigrant
visa waiting list. However, under cur-
rent law, only 226,000 family green
cards and 140,000 employee green cards
are available each year. Children and
spouses of lawful permanent residents,
known as LPRs, count against these
caps, which further limit the number of
available green cards.
The backlogs are a tremendous hard-
ship on families caught in this situa-
tion. Children of parents waiting to be-
come LPRs often age out, as I de-
scribed earlier, because they are no
longer children by the time the green
cards are available for them. The solu-
tion is clear: increase the number of
green cards.
Let’s be clear. Lifting green card
country caps alone, without increasing
green cards, as the bill that Senator
LEE is sponsoring would do, will not
eliminate the backlog for Indian immi-
grants, the nationality with the most
people in the employment backlog, and
it will dramatically increase backlogs
for the rest of the world.
Mr. Ira Kurzban, who is the Nation’s
expert on immigration laws, has said
that we are virtually trying to solve
the problem with Senator LEE’s bill for
Indian immigrants at the expense of
everyone else in the world. He says:
From 2023 until well into the 2030s, there
will be zero EB–2 visas for the rest of the
world. None for China, South Korea, Phil-
ippines, Britain, Canada, Mexico, every
country in the [European Union] and all of
Africa. Zero.
It would also choke off green cards
for every important profession that
isn’t in the information technology
field.
More than 20 national organizations
have now rallied against the Lee legis-
lation and have said things such as
that the bill offers a ‘‘zero-sum ap-
proach,’’ pitting one group of immi-
grants against another to fight the bro-
ken immigration system.
The RELIEF Act, which I am intro-
ducing today, is a solution.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2603
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, as in
legislative session, I ask unanimous
consent that the Senate proceed to the
immediate consideration—
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator has used his extra 3 minutes.
Mr. DURBIN. I am making a unani-
mous consent request.
As in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate proceed
to the immediate consideration of S.
2603, introduced earlier today; further,
that the bill be considered read three
times and passed and that the motion
to reconsider be considered made and
laid upon the table with no intervening
action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Louisiana.
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, no one in
this Chamber has more respect for the
senior Senator from Illinois and the
Democratic whip than I do. I share
much of his frustration. I also share,
and I believe what the Senator also be-
lieves, that immigration is an extraor-
dinarily important subject that this
body should be addressing. We are a na-
tion of immigrants. The American peo-
ple support legal immigration. I know
the senior Senator from Illinois sup-
ports it. I certainly support it.
I am rising to object because a num-
ber of my colleagues—and I don’t want
to simply put it on them; I join with
them in this—would like a little addi-
tional time to study this bill. Equally
important, if not more important,
many of my colleagues’ sentiment is
that we should take this bill up first in
the Judiciary Committee.
I commit to the minority whip that I
will join with him in trying to get our
esteemed chairman to take this bill up.
I don’t think we ought to be afraid of
this issue. I don’t think we ought to be
reluctant to take difficult votes. That
is why we are here in the U.S. Senate.
I also cannot think of a subject that is
more important for this body to ad-
dress than the subject of immigration,
including but not limited to legal and
illegal immigration.
The fact of the matter is that the
American people deserve an immigra-
tion system that looks like somebody
designed it on purpose.
For the reasons I just expressed,
Madam President, I respectfully object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Illinois.
Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague
from Louisiana. We have worked on
things together, and I hope we will con-
tinue to do so in the future.
This is controversial, but it is so
timely and important. The hundreds of
people who demonstrated against this
Senator last Sunday were people I wel-
comed into this country and believe
will be an important part of our future.
I am willing to find a solution to the
problem, and I am willing to work on a
bipartisan basis to do it. Your help will
be invaluable.

Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask

utes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

PENSIONS
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I just
came from a rally—a meeting—with
more or less 100 middle-class workers
from Wisconsin, West Virginia, my
State of Ohio, and all over the country.
There were teamsters and mineworkers
dressed in camo shirts. There were also
bakery and confectionery workers, car-
penters, and electricians. They were
here because many of them—maybe all
of them—are about to lose 50 percent of
their pensions. They are about to lose
their pensions because 10 years ago, in
the end days of the Bush administra-
tion, which was when our economy
plummeted and people were losing
jobs—800,000 jobs a month in the last
months of the Bush administration—
and when companies were going out of
business, a lot of the employers of
these workers went out of business.
When you put on top of that the Wall
Street greed, you can see why these
pensions are in jeopardy.
Too often in this town, the White
House, frankly, and my Senate col-
leagues don’t understand what collec-
tive bargaining is about. Collective
bargaining is negotiating at the bar-
gaining table the giving up of wages
today so as to put money aside and
have pensions and healthcare in the fu-
ture. That is what these workers did,
these teamsters and these confection
workers and these ironworkers. That is
what they did, but they are paying a
price. There is nothing they did to
cause this, but they are paying a price.
Now, parenthetically, this body fell
all over itself to bail out Wall Street
and to help the big auto companies,
and look how they are paying back
their workers. This body, the Presi-
dent—all of them are fine with bailing
out the big guys. Yet the President has
been absent, and the Senate Repub-
lican leadership has been absent. The
exception is that Senator PORTMAN has
been working with me, as has Senator
HOEVEN and others, but the leadership
has been absent with regard to trying
to fix this pension issue.
You love your country, and you fight
for the people who make it work. You
fight for the dignity of work, which
means honoring and respecting work.
We have to do better.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2254
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the
Committee on Finance be discharged
from further consideration of S. 2254,
the Butch Lewis Act; that the Senate
proceed to its immediate consider-
ation; that the bill be considered read a
third time and passed; and that the
motion to reconsider be considered
made and laid upon the table with no
intervening action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
an objection?
The Senator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in re-
serving the right to object, I have some
sympathy for the motion that Senator
BROWN made because he just came from
a meeting with people who are very in-
terested in getting this multiemployer
pension issue straightened out.
It was 3 or 4 years ago that I spoke to
a big delegation of people who were
mostly from the Central States Team-
sters, and they were very much lob-
bying for a solution to this problem.
They treated me like a hero because at
that time we were probably in the mid-
dle of a Government Accountability Of-
fice investigation of the mismanage-
ment of these funds. We thought we
were going to get a GAO report that
would show the mismanagement, reap
the benefits of that mismanagement,
and recoup a lot of funds. Quite frank-
ly, that Government Accountability
Office study of about 2 years didn’t
prove what I thought and what the
Central States Teamsters people
thought was wrong. We still think the
mismanagement was there, but if you
don’t have an authority like the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office to jus-
tify that, it doesn’t give you much of a
leg to follow up on.
Now we have the Butch Lewis Act for
which Senator BROWN is asking unani-
mous consent. We also have other pro-
posals that the Senate Committee on
Finance, which I chair, has been work-
ing on—and not only under my chair-
manship. The biggest part of this work
was probably done when Senator Hatch
was still the chairman of the com-
mittee.
I also want to give people the reasons
I have asked to reserve the right to ob-
ject.
The Butch Lewis Act doesn’t provide
long-term solvency to the Central
States’ plan or to other critical and de-
clining multiemployer pension plans.
It is a costly and incomplete attempt
to fix the multiemployer system.
According to the Congressional Budg-
et Office, many plans that would be eli-
gible for loans under this legislation
couldn’t pay these loans back, and
most of the plans taking the loans

would become insolvent even if they
were able to pay back the loans. The
bill acknowledges this failing by pro-
viding for direct Federal assistance for
plans that go insolvent even after they
receive loans.
Most critically, the Butch Lewis Act
makes no reforms to the system in
order to secure its long-term solvency.
That is not the way we ought to be
working to help retirees.
In getting back to the work of the
Committee on Finance, since last year,
both under Senator Hatch’s leadership
and mine, the committee has been
working on a bipartisan basis to ad-
dress the issues facing the multiem-
ployer system. I emphasize the neces-
sity of bipartisanship in the U.S. Sen-
ate. When you have a division of 53 to
47 and you have to have 60 votes to get
something done in this body, biparti-
sanship is very, very important.
The committee is nearing its comple-
tion of a comprehensive proposal that
will include financial assistance to the
critical and declining multiemployer
pension plans and provide long-term
solvency to these plans and to the Pen-
sion Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
That proposal will include financial re-
lief for plans like Central States’ and
for the coal miners.
The Butch Lewis Act is so costly and
does nothing to fix the flaws in the sys-
tem that has brought about this bill. In
relationship to the Government Ac-
countability Office, I spoke to some of
those flaws that I initiated a few years
ago. There is really nothing in the pro-
posal on which Senator BROWN is ask-
ing for a UC that addresses the mis-
management of the trustees. Our com-
prehensive plan includes reforms to ad-
dress trustee requirements and plan op-
erations. In other words, the people in
the private sector who are managing
this ought to have some responsibility
of making sure they are doing it in a
fiscally sound way and are carrying out
the rights of the trustees.
So I object to this request.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Ohio.
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank
Senator GRASSLEY, and we will be
working together on this.
I just want to point out that there
was, of course, some mismanagement.
As does the Senator, I want to fix some
of the structural issues, but time is of
the essence. I understand this is not
happening today, but time is of the es-
sence with regard to these pensions, es-
pecially for the mineworkers. Those for
the teamsters are next and for the oth-
ers in the Central States. As Chairman
GRASSLEY knows, it will get worse and
worse and worse if we don’t get this
done this year.
I do want to emphasize, while there
of course is some mismanagement of
funds here, the preponderance of the
problem is that a bunch of mining com-
panies, construction companies, and
transportation companies went out of
business with the Bush recession in
2007, 2008, and 2009, taking away the
companies paying into these funds.
The other part of it was Wall Street
greed, generally what happened to the
stock market.
That is the preponderance of the
problem, but I concur with Senator
GRASSLEY that we can work on a lot of
this together. Senator PORTMAN and I
especially have a responsibility to get
this done, to make it happen.
I thank the chairman.
I yield the floor.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

MAIDEN SPEECH
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President,
my story begins with my mom. My
mom had a very difficult life. She grew
up with a verbally abusive, alcoholic
father. She married a physically abu-
sive, alcoholic husband, whom she di-
vorced when I was born. At that time,
divorce was frowned upon. My birth fa-
ther never gave my mom, my older
brother, or me a dime. I never met him.
My mom eventually married the man
who became my adoptive father, a bus-
driver who made all four combat jumps
with the 82nd Airborne in World War II.
This summer, I had the opportunity to
go to the D-Day anniversary in Nor-
mandy and to look at the area he
parachuted into, where 17 percent of
his company died.
He was a loving father, but with only
a sixth-grade education and five chil-
dren, he struggled to support our fam-
ily. We had no money and lived in pub-
lic housing, but even with all of those
issues, I cannot think of a better child-
hood.
Even with no money, my mom was
optimistic and hopeful. She told us
that we were blessed because God and
our Founders created the greatest
country ever, where anything was pos-
sible. I am not sure my mom ever real-
ly had a plan for us, but she certainly
knew what she was doing. We sat
through many sermons, and church was
not optional. We were told we had to
make straight A’s. We memorized the
first part of the Declaration of Inde-
pendence and the 23rd Psalm. We be-
came Eagle Scouts, cleaned the house,
and had to have a job. I started work-
ing at 7 years old and haven’t stopped
since.
We weren’t allowed to complain.
Debt, Big Government, socialism, and
communism were bad. College was for a
better paying job.
We were constantly lectured about
the dangers of drug abuse. Unfortu-
nately, drugs have destroyed the life of
one of my family members.
I enlisted in the U.S. Navy at 18,
where I swabbed the decks, cleaned the
latrines, served the mess decks, and
took college courses aboard a destroyer
during the last years of Vietnam but
never close to Vietnam.
I married my high school sweetheart
at 19, and, today, Ann and I have two
daughters, six very perfect grandsons,
and a seventh very perfect grandchild
on the way next year. My wonderful
wife, Ann, is here today and has been
by my side every step of our journey.
While I didn’t always appreciate my
tough-love, my-way-or-the-highway
mom growing up, I now thank God
every day for my mom and for this
country. She gave me the opportunity
to experience every lesson this country
had to offer before I was 20.
Unfortunately, the left has worked
hard over the last 50 years to discredit
the values of the America I was raised
with—the values of the America I want
my grandsons to grow up with. We all
acknowledge that Americans, our
country, and our institutions have
flaws, but the left has worked to dis-
credit our Founders, our institutions,
our churches, our law enforcement, our
morals, and almost everything my
mom taught me. It has been happening
for a long time.
The left railed against our soldiers
during the Vietnam war. They call
those still believing in a supreme being
or the commitment of marriage unin-
formed and old fashioned. They are
now openly saying that churches that
hold traditional values should lose
their tax-exempt status.
The left doesn’t care about our enor-
mous debt, pushes for socialism, and
criticizes the Boy Scouts. The left
thinks it is OK that our schools don’t
teach about the Founding Fathers or
free markets. They want you to think
America was never great.
To a degree, the pressure from the
left is working. Americans under 30 are
less interested in joining the military.
Church attendance is at an all-time
low. Participation in the Boy Scouts,
even after allowing girls in, has
shrunk. Many are choosing not to have
families. And Socialism, the single
most discredited idea of the last cen-
tury—an idea that has led millions into
poverty and tyranny around the
globe—has gained a foothold in one of
our two political parties.
I spent most of my life in business.
The values that my tough-love mom
instilled in me helped me to achieve
the success she expected—not just
hoped for but expected—for me. I was
able to live the American dream be-
cause I worked hard. I lived out the
values my mom taught me in my busi-
ness career—hard work and fiscal re-
sponsibility but with a caring spirit to
support those around me.
I built a healthcare company that
had lower costs and better quality of
care than my competitors. We had the
highest patient satisfaction surveys in

the industry. I built and bought busi-
nesses for most of my life that helped
hundreds of thousands of people get
good, high-paying jobs. Many of them
were failing businesses that we had to
turn around to save jobs.
My experience growing up in a family
that struggled to get good jobs influ-
enced everything I have done in my
life. It is not easy, and it shouldn’t be,
but everyone—every single American—
should have the opportunity to strug-
gle, work hard, and overcome the ob-
stacles.
I took those exact same values to the
Governor’s office when I was elected in
2010. Florida had been struggling, and
832,000 jobs had been lost in the 4 years
before I took office. Home prices were
cut in half. Debt was soaring. The
State raised taxes on its poorest citi-
zens by more than $2 billion to fill a
budget hole.
I always think about my mom. I
think about how it impacted her when
food prices went up, taxes went up,
when my brother got sick without
health insurance, and when my dad was
laid off. I became a jobs Governor. It
wasn’t a political talking point. It was
about real people.
I have traveled around the State
highlighting new businesses that
opened in Florida, even small busi-
nesses. I remember a local legislator
asking me once why I wasted my time
going to a small town in Florida to
highlight a new business’s opening
with just 30 new jobs. My response was
that my dad struggled to find any job,
and that is 30 families who have the op-
portunity to live the American Dream,
and what could be more important?
In 8 years, Florida added 1.7 million
new jobs, we paid down almost one-
third of State debt, and we invested
record funding in education, the envi-
ronment, and transportation.
I also tried to fight for the values
that are being lost in this country. I
fight to protect life, to support the in-
stitution of the family, to lift up our
military members, veterans, and law
enforcement, to promote capitalism,
and to defend the rule of law and the
Constitution.
These values are under attack from
the left and have been for quite some
time. There is no easy solution to that
problem, but one thing is clear: Gov-
ernment is not the solution. Wash-
ington is not the solution.
In my short time in the U.S. Senate,
I have promoted policies I believe sup-
port the idea of an America where any-
thing is possible. We need lower taxes.
We need less regulation. We need a se-
cure border and a sane immigration
policy. We need to get healthcare costs
under control. We need to defend free-
dom and liberty all over the world. But
none of this will matter unless we see
hearts and minds change. We need a re-
newal in America of the values that
made this country great. That will not
happen on the floor of the U.S. Senate.
It will happen in the living rooms,
classrooms, churches, synagogues, and
boardrooms.
We need to remember that hard work
is a feature, not a bug, of this Amer-
ican experiment and that the family
unit is at the center of our society, and
the breakdown of the family has been
hugely detrimental. We need to re-
member that capitalism is the greatest
force for economic good in the history
of the world and socialism belongs in
the ash-heap of history. We need to re-
member these things because our free-
doms and the country we love can be
lost forever. The values that made
America great can go away, and there
are those among us who want them to
go away.
This challenge is much bigger than
politics, and the solution is not polit-
ical. It requires us—every one of us—to
stand up and fight and to say without
reservation or fear that we will not
give up on America or the plans of our
Founders. We will not stop fighting for
our future.
If we want America to be great in the
future, we must reject the politically
correct attempts to rewrite our his-
tory, and we must reject the leftwing
attempt to slander the greatness of our
ideals. America is, in fact, the greatest
country in the history of the world,
and we should not be embarrassed to
say so. We should proclaim it proudly.
America is the greatest country in the
history of the world.
I fear the values that I grew up
with—the ones my tough-love mom
taught me—are becoming a way of the
past, but I believe these values, these
virtues can and should be part of our
country’s future.
I love it when my grandkids pray be-
fore eating, recite the Pledge of Alle-
giance, ask to visit military museums,
join the Boy Scouts, thank police offi-
cers and soldiers for their service, and
place their hand over their heart when
they hear the National Anthem. I hope
they memorize the Declaration of Inde-
pendence and the 23rd Psalm, become
Eagle Scouts, have crummy-paying
teenage jobs with unreasonable bosses,
and get benched in sports for not try-
ing hard enough. Also, I pray they con-
sider a life of military service—one al-
ready wants to be a paratrooper—and
are lucky enough to marry a wonderful
person and have enough kids to worry
about how to pay for college.
Maybe my grandkids will complain
about parents being way too strict.
Maybe they will complain about de-
manding teachers and bosses not car-
ing what they think. Maybe they will
complain about screaming drill ser-
geants, difficult degrees, restrictive
banks, and life not being fair. If so, I
will smile and say: ‘‘That’s great;
America is back.’’ Then, I will know
my grandsons have the opportunity to
do something worthwhile with their
lives, like build a loving family, suc-
cessful career, thriving community,
better country, and better world.
In the meantime, I will keep fight-
ing. I ran for public office to fight for
the country I was raised in because
that is the country our children and
our grandchildren deserve. They de-
serve what my mom gave me—a free
country with unlimited potential for
every citizen. I hope everyone will join
me in this fight.

NOMINATION OF FRANK WILLIAM VOLK
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise
today in strong support of the nomina-
tion of Frank W. Volk to be the U.S.
district court judge of the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of West
Virginia.
I want to thank my colleagues in the
Senate for putting partisanship aside
and recognizing the importance of con-
firming qualified judges to our Federal
courts.
Frank Volk’s cloture vote earlier
today cleared this body by a 90-to-0
vote without a single dissenting vote.
Let me repeat that—90 to 0. How many
times have we seen that happen in this
body? That is a testament to Judge
Volk’s judicial experience, stellar
record, and his qualifications to be-
come a U.S. district court judge.
I would also like to acknowledge
Frank’s work in West Virginia as a
tireless public servant to both our
State and the Nation. He has conveyed
time and again his love and desire to
serve our Nation and particularly our
great State of West Virginia. He has
served with honor throughout his ca-
reer and is willing to step up to the
plate one more time. He shows the
country how West Virginians act and
serve.
I would also like to thank his family,
including his wife, Angie, and his two
children, Garrett and Lauren, for their
tremendous support of Frank and his
continued work as a public servant. He
is a proud Italian person, like myself.
He is currently the chief judge of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the South-
ern District of West Virginia, where he
has worked since he was appointed in
October of 2015.
As a WVU College of Law graduate
and editor-in-chief of the West Virginia
Law Review, Frank’s resume is ex-
tremely impressive.
He continues to give back to his edu-
cation. He has taught part time at
WVU College of Law for almost 15
years. He has taught courses in Federal
civil rights, advanced torts, bank-
ruptcy, and advanced bankruptcy. It is
great to see a fellow Mountaineer suc-
ceed in their profession, and I look for-
ward to seeing his career continue.
He has also authored a number of
bankruptcy articles and spoken at na-
tional and regional conferences on
bankruptcy matters, along with being
a faculty member for the Federal Judi-
cial Center.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5817
October 16, 2019
Judge Volk is admitted to practice in
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit, the U.S. District Court
of the Southern District of West Vir-
ginia, the West Virginia bar, and the
Pennsylvania bar.
During his career, Frank has worked
with a number of esteemed judges:
Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge
M. Blane Michael, district judges
Charles H. Haden II and previously
John T. Copenhaver, Jr. Frank is also a
permanent member of the Fourth Cir-
cuit Judicial Conference.
Frank has contributed volunteer
service to the American Bankruptcy
Institute for many years. He served
most recently as the coordinating edi-
tor for the ABI Journal, focusing on
the ‘‘Problems in the Code’’ column.
Even with all of those accolades,
Frank knows and understands the
value of hard work because he is a West
Virginian through and through, and
that is just what we do.
The Federal bench that serves West
Virginia needs judges who are thought-
ful, hard-working, and have good judg-
ment. Frank fits that role. Frank
brings such a great level of experience
to the bench. I can safely say I am
pleased that President Trump has nom-
inated him to be a U.S. district court
judge on the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of West Virginia. I
think we all will be served well by
Frank’s service.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut.
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, the
most sacred, the most important, and
the most profound responsibility that a
President of the United States has is to
keep Americans safe. Everything else
that we care about—the citizens of this
great Nation, the best Nation in the
planet—matters very little if our phys-
ical safety and the physical safety of
our families and our loved ones aren’t
assured. That is job No. 1 for the Presi-
dent of the United States.
I believe the President has likely
committed offenses that are worthy of
impeachment, and I think it is likely
that information is going to emerge
from the House’s inquiry that would
present Republicans with clear evi-
dence that the President’s abuse of of-
fice has been serious.
Obviously, we need to wait for the ar-
ticles of impeachment to arrive in the
Senate—if they do arrive—before any
of us decide our vote on removal, but
the publicly stipulated facts already
surrounding the President’s shadow
foreign policy designed not to advance
the national interests but his personal
political interests are damning.
So far, my Republican friends have
rallied to the President’s side, despite
public opinion moving pretty quickly
against the President and in favor of
an inquiry in the House. So today I
want to use my time on the floor to
ask just a simple question of my Re-
publican colleagues. I want to ask what
the costs are to the physical safety of
the Nation of continuing to protect the
President from the consequences of his
misdeeds because as we gather in the
Senate for our fall session, we are
watching American national security
policy go completely and fully off the
rails. Our global reputation and our
credibility have been shattered to
pieces, and no one knows whether they
can be reassembled. Our Nation’s de-
fenses have never been weaker. Our en-
emies are gathering strength by the
day. Fear of American power is waning.
Our global system of alliances is fall-
ing apart. Our friends are turning away
from America because we are a demon-
strably unreliable partner, and those
friends may never come back.
Right now, before our eyes, American
power is in a free fall, and our Nation’s
safety is at risk. American citizens are
looking to this place for leadership, but
when they lift up the hood looking for
steely-eyed patriots, all they are find-
ing are blind partisans. What is the
cost, I ask my colleagues, of letting
America continue to slide into global
irrelevancy? How many American lives
are going to be ultimately lost because
we sat on the sidelines and we let
American influence fade as our Presi-
dent becomes a toxic commodity, the
butt of jokes, and an international pa-
riah? What must it take for this body
to put aside party and come together
to salvage our shrinking American se-
curity?
I want to take a few moments—a few
more than I normally take when I
come down to the floor—to take my
colleagues on a tour of the world right
now just so everybody understands how
dangerous the situation has gotten, to
understand just how broad the scope of
our foreign policy dysfunction is right
now, because just maybe—maybe—if
you see the crisis all in one map, all in
one summary, my colleagues might
wake up to the magnitude of this emer-
gency.
It is hard to start anywhere but in
the Ukraine. The power of the Amer-
ican executive branch has no equal. No
individual in the world has more power
than Donald Trump has today. That
power comes with responsibility and
guardrails.
The one firm promise that a Presi-
dent must make to those he governs is
to use the powers of the Oval Office for
the national interest and not for his
personal or financial interest. But it is
now clear beyond a reasonable doubt
after all this testimony—much of it
from Republicans before the House—
that President Trump has turned our
support for Ukraine into a personal
poker chip to be cashed in in order to
get Ukraine to help him destroy his po-
litical rivals. This just isn’t allowed in
a democracy.
The damage done by Trump’s corrup-
tion of the Ukraine relationship is far
beyond this broken covenant with the
American people. He pulled essential
assistance to Ukraine just when their
new President needed U.S. support the
most. Trump has weakened Ukraine
dramatically by pulling them into this
mess, and Russia is the beneficiary.
Make no mistake—Putin has won for
the time being, and those fighting for
democracy have lost for the time
being, sold out by their fair-weather
American friends who are more inter-
ested in destroying the President’s po-
litical opponents than supporting
Ukraine.
Now, other nations on Russia’s and
China’s periphery, wondering whether
to simply acquiesce to the bullying
dominance of their neighbors or put up
a fight for independence, now are less
likely to do the latter, knowing that
the United States is there only to help
if their nation fulfills our President’s
personal requests.
The world’s eyes this week are down
here in Syria, where the President has
engaged in one of the worst, most
abominable acts of double-cross in the
history of the American Presidency.
We convinced the Kurdish military to
fight ISIS forces for us. We convinced
them to take down their defense
against a potential Turkish invasion
because we promised to protect them.
And then, out of nowhere, a week and
a half ago, Trump stabbed the Kurds in
the back. He announced the pullback of
our forces and invited by press release
the Turkish army to march into Syria
and destroy our ally, the Kurds, whom
today he has denigrated by telling the
world that they are not actually as
good fighters as everybody says they
are.
The damage to our Nation’s security
done by this one single act is almost
too comprehensive to list in one
speech. ISIS detainees have escaped
their jail cells and are now likely re-
constituting and possibly readying new
attacks against the United States.
They can plot without fear of interrup-
tion because the Kurds have ended
their fight against ISIS to try to sur-
vive this Turkish offensive.
Now, in addition to ISIS, Russia, the
Syrian regime, and the Iranians all
grew stronger in Syria overnight as we
stood down, and they will quickly reap
the benefits of Trump’s abandonment
of the Kurds. It is a nightmare in Syria
today, and it is going to get much
worse before it gets better.
Let’s move down to China, where
President-for-life Xi Jinping has been
steadily consolidating power, building
a model of totalitarian control that de-
nies basic human rights to its popu-
lation of 1.4 billion. The United States
has watched from the sidelines as
China not only conducts cultural geno-
cide against its Muslim population in
its own country but also grows its glob-
al clout and exports its model and
technology of repression around the
world.
China’s military continues to gain in
strength and push their unlawful terri-
torial claims further in the Western
Pacific. We do virtually nothing. Chi-
na’s Belt and Road Initiative is forging

linkages across the globe, building
foundations for long-term techno-
logical, economic, and strategic domi-
nance.
The United States stands on the side-
lines under the Trump administration.
The sum total of our bilateral inter-
actions thus far with China has been a
bungled, disastrous, job-killing trade
war. It is a trade war that really only
made sense in Trump’s campaign
speeches but never had a chance to suc-
ceed without the help of other poten-
tial partners that the President never
tried to enlist.
Every single day, Trump is losing the
trade war badly. Our trade deficit with
China isn’t going down; it is going up.
The tariffs on Chinese imports could
cost middle-class American consumers
$1,000 a year, and our economy has
slowed down and is on its way to poten-
tially losing 300,000 jobs because of the
trade war. It is an unmitigated eco-
nomic disaster for our Nation, and this
nightmare, like all the others, seems to
be getting worse. All the while, China
forges ahead to corner the market on
next-generation technologies like 5G,
drones, and artificial intelligence, leav-
ing America and American companies
potentially shut out of these markets.
Nowhere has China’s heavyhanded re-
pression been more apparent than right
here in Hong Kong. Yet again, we have
been totally absent. In Hong Kong,
brave, pro-democracy protesters should
be seen as America’s best friends—Chi-
nese people who are risking everything
to fight for basic freedoms in an in-
creasingly totalitarian state. There is
no better way to undermine China’s
unfair trade model than to promote the
rights of its consumers and its citizens.
But Trump promised the Chinese re-
gime that he would offer no support to
the Hong Kong protesters—an uncon-
scionable promise that he has kept—
while China runs circles around him on
trade talks.
Staying in Asia, let’s run right up
the road to the most immediate and
terrifying existential threat: a nuclear-
armed homicidal dictator with the ca-
pacity and willingness to nuke us and
our allies in the region—North Korea.
A lot of ink has been spilled on the
pomp and circumstance of Trump’s
summits and the ongoing love affair
that he claims with Kim Jong Un, but
what has actually been the result of
nearly 3 years of Trump’s North Ko-
rean diplomacy besides stroking his
ego? The answer is nothing. Kim con-
tinues to fire missiles into the Sea of
Japan. He continues to quietly build
his nuclear stockpile. Even the freeze
on nuclear long-range missile tests is
temporary, and the North Koreans are
warning they might resume that at the
end of the year.
Meanwhile, we abandoned the South
Koreans, we canceled our joint mili-
tary exercises, and we nearly withdrew
our troops entirely. Kim got inter-
national recognition and essentially a
free pass to keep building his arsenal
and making it more deadly while we
weakened all of our regional alliances.
America and the world are dramati-
cally less safe right now.
All over the world, in fact, dictators
and would-be dictators are racking up
stunning records of human rights
abuses right now because they know
that under President Trump, America
will really raise no issue and no pro-
tests.
Go down here to the Philippines, for
instance, where there have been 20,000
people who have vanished in the
extrajudicial massacres by President
Duterte. No protests from the United
States, and 20,000 have vanished.
Thousands of political dissidents are
being locked up in places like Turkey,
Egypt, and Saudi Arabia—these are
supposed U.S. allies—and have no one
to speak for them because America
now doesn’t do anything about civil
rights or human rights. We have van-
ished from the human rights playing
field.
In Saudi Arabia, in fact, their leader-
ship felt so emboldened by Trump’s em-
brace of brutal strongmen that they
kidnapped an American resident who
was critical of the Saudi regime. They
chopped him to pieces, and then they
got rid of the body parts. The dots are
piling up in the Middle East. The re-
sponse from the United States to
Jamal Khashoggi’s murder was a visit
to Riyadh by the American Secretary
of State for a smiling photo op to make
sure that every foreign leader in every
corner of the world recognized that
human rights abuses would be forgiven
pretty immediately by this new Amer-
ican regime.
Elsewhere in the Middle East—I don’t
know that I can just keep on piling up
more and more dots, but elsewhere in
the Middle East, things are falling
apart fast due mostly to the Trump ad-
ministration’s incompetence. It started
with this nonsensical fracture of rela-
tions between Saudi Arabia and an-
other key U.S. Gulf ally, Qatar. It was
the kind of disruption that, frankly,
would normally be papered over and
fixed by a competent U.S. administra-
tion probably in days, but 3 years later,
the two countries—Saudi Arabia and
Qatar—still aren’t talking, largely be-
cause we did nothing to fix it. Making
matters worse, Saudi Arabia and their
one remaining friend in the region,
UAE, aren’t getting along now either.
Under Trump, the war in Yemen
began to rage out of control. Tens of
thousands of innocent Yemenis, many
of them little children, died needlessly
as Trump piled more weapons and more
bombs into the war and did really
nothing to try to find a peace agree-
ment between the parties who for a
year had been begging the United
States to step in and play a traditional
role as mediator. The conflict has
raged on for so long due to Trump’s un-
willingness to use America’s diplo-
matic muscle that events on the
ground have become so chaotic that
the Saudis and the Emiratis have now
parted ways. Now, with the Qataris,
the Saudis, and the Emiratis all on dif-
ferent wavelengths, the potential for
proxy wars between these wealthy na-
tions could get much worse all over the
Middle East.
In Iran, right next door, the cam-
paign of blind escalation and provo-
cation has been disastrous. Every one
of the President’s national security ad-
visors told him to stay in the Iran nu-
clear agreement and focus his energies
on addressing Iran’s other malevolent
behavior in the region, like their bal-
listic missile program or their support
for terrorist organizations. Trump ig-
nored all his advisors, like he has ig-
nored all the rest of the counsel he has
received on major foreign policy mat-
ters, and he canceled the agreement
and implemented a series of unilateral
sanctions against Iran. He coordinated
with absolutely no one.
Now, Iran, feeling cornered but also
not feeling particularly vulnerable,
given the fact that America couldn’t
recruit any of our friends to our new
anti-Iran campaign, hit back against
oil tankers, American drones, and
Saudi pipelines. We now seem perpet-
ually on the precipice of war with Iran.
Meanwhile, they have restarted parts
of their shuttered nuclear program. We
haven’t convinced a single nation to
help us build new sanctions, and there
is absolutely no chance that Trump is
going to secure a better deal than the
JCPOA before he leaves office in just
over a year.
Iran is a bigger menace than before
he took office. They just scored an-
other major victory with Trump’s
abandonment of the Kurds, and an
anti-Iran coalition that the United
States methodically built under
Barack Obama has vanished, perhaps
never again to be resurrected.
In this very red region of the world
right now, the only leader who has
been happy with Trump’s dangerous,
bizarre, nonstrategy on Iran has been
Benjamin Netanyahu, but he may not
be in power much longer, and his alli-
ance with Trump has left his successor
a frightening legacy. Under Trump’s
watch, the two-state solution in
Israel—a longtime bipartisan lynchpin
of American policy in the Middle
East—has effectively fallen apart.
Trump has allowed Israel to take
steps that make a future Palestinian
state almost impossible. For 3 years,
he has put his son-in-law—whose only
experience was using his father’s
money to buy real estate—in charge of
brokering peace between Israel and the
Palestinians. It was a joke. Everybody
knew it, but since Trump was Presi-
dent, everybody had to play along. Now
there is no peace plan. There was never
going to be a peace plan, and the
chances for one are almost nonexistent
after 3 years of the Trump administra-
tion.
Down in Libya, Trump admittedly in-
herited a pretty miserable situation,
but somehow, like everything else, he
managed to make it worse. The coun-
try has been fractured for years, as

October 16, 2019
rival militias with a host of foreign pa-
trons have been fighting a civil war
that has created a vacuum that has
been filled in by extremists and a mi-
grant crisis that continues to expand.
But instead of doing the hard work of
diplomacy to try to get the warring
parties back to the table, instead,
Trump threw his support—his personal
support—behind General Haftar, upend-
ing years of American diplomacy and
endorsing Haftar’s plan to try to take
Tripoli by force. As a result, the fight-
ing there continues, peace talks are
failing, and the humanitarian crisis
grows by the day.
One of the consequences of this
Trump death spiral in Libya and the
Middle East is that the economic and
political refugees continue to flow into
Europe, which simply isn’t politically
ready to accept this rate of inflow, and
by slashing the number of refugees al-
lowed in the United States from over
100,000 to 18,000, we have communicated
to the Europeans that we have no in-
terest in helping. Just like everything
else, Trump has made the assimilation
of the Muslim immigrants into Europe
even harder by serving as a model for
racist, xenophobic demagogues, and
rightwing nationalist political parties
who want to bring Trump’s form of po-
litical nativism into Europe.
Nationalist political parties are on
the rise all across the West, and Trump
is absolutely central to their develop-
ment. He gravitates not toward Angela
Merkel, whose courageous leadership
has held the EU together through all
these crises, but he hews to Viktor
Orban, who has stoked the embers of
nationalism to take Hungary down a
dark path. Trump and his nationalist
compatriots weaponize these fears of
immigration and cultural change to
justify really bad policies—from label-
ing journalists as enemies of the state
to putting kids in cages. And when
rightwing groups try to copy Trump’s
success and deploy his playbook in
countries all throughout Europe, he
doesn’t stand up and object, as the
leader of the free world should; he of-
fers a wink and a nod or sometimes a
warm embrace.
Trump doesn’t stop there in his delib-
erate attempts to undermine European
democracy. He has carried out a sys-
tematic, purposeful campaign to weak-
en the European Union and NATO. By
now, we have all grown used to
Trump’s attacks on globalism, but it is
still pretty extraordinary that we have
a President who just doesn’t attack the
specific institutions he loathes, such as
the U.N., the EU, or NATO; he levies
regular broadsides against the entire
concept of global cooperation. He sees
multilateralism as a weakness, and his
cheerleading of Britain out the door of
the EU and his constant attacks on
NATO, even to the point of wondering
out loud if the United States would de-
fend allies if attacked risks taking
down the entire post-World War II
order. That would be a disaster for us
and a gift to countries like China, Rus-
sia, India, and nonstate actors such as
al-Qaida and ISIS.
When it comes to our relations with
Europe, Trump reserves his greatest
multilateral animus for global at-
tempts to address climate change. The
Paris Agreement wasn’t even a binding
commitment on the United States, but
Trump felt so strongly that climate
change was a Chinese-perpetrated
hoax—unwind that riddle for me—that
he pulled us out of the agreement in a
big, grand, festive ceremony at the
White House.
Global climate catastrophe is coming
if we don’t do anything. In fact, it is al-
ready here. The story of Syria’s de-
scent into madness can partially be
told through the tale of successive
global warming-connected droughts
that forced farmers into overcrowded
cities that weren’t ready for those pop-
ulation surges. Trump’s hostility to
climate action is one of his most
unforgiveable global legacies, and the
next President may not have enough
time or political capital to make up
the ground we have lost on climate
change, especially with European part-
ners.
Speaking of failure to capitalize on
opportunities, let’s spin the globe back
to our own hemisphere, where, accord-
ing to the script, things couldn’t be
going much worse. Here in the Amer-
icas everything that Trump has
touched thus far has fallen apart, and
the United States is weaker regionally
than ever before.
Trump’s nativism is his political
calling card, but his own policies seem
to encourage more migration to the
United States, not less of it. President
Trump’s decision to cut off foreign as-
sistance to Central American countries
because they weren’t doing enough to
stop migration is lunacy. President
Obama’s program of investing in Cen-
tral American security so that less of
their citizens felt the need to flee to
America was beginning to work, and
Trump gave it all away simply to pro-
vide fuel to his domestic political agen-
da.
Further south, U.S.-Venezuela policy
is one of the few times Trump’s Presi-
dency stood up to a dictator. Unfortu-
nately, because Trump doesn’t know
how to do foreign policy, he botched
that intervention too. It has been real-
ly embarrassing to watch this adminis-
tration repeatedly and wrongly claim
that the Maduro regime is on the verge
of collapse. They did it in January,
when Juan Guaido swore himself in as
interim President. They did it again in
February, when they said deploying
American aid along the border would
trigger the regime’s fall, and they did
it again in April in a lead-up to a mili-
tary uprising that went nowhere. The
White House has engaged in tough talk
only to see Maduro’s hold on power en-
dure.
Trump played all his cards on this
crisis right in the first few days, like a
nervous teenager. Now we are left sanc-
tioning the Venezuelan people and rec-
ognizing a leader of the country who
isn’t really the leader of that country
and probably isn’t going to be the lead-
er of that country. It is yet another
failure that makes us look weak and
foolish. We make a play and can’t back
it up. It is hard to be scared of the
United States when everything we try
to do goes wrong.
Let’s move back over to the African
Continent for a moment. Now, as a
candidate, Trump repeatedly stoked
fears of the Ebola epidemic in West Af-
rica, tweeting that the United States
‘‘must immediately stop all flights
from EBOLA infected countries or the
plague will start to spread inside our
borders!’’ Of course, this didn’t make
any sense, and it doesn’t make any
sense now. We have known for ages
that travel bans aren’t actually the
best way to deal with an outbreak of
disease, but since he has become Presi-
dent, the Trump administration has
asked Congress to rescind $252 million
that had been put aside to deal with
the virus. He ousted the NSC’s top bio-
defense expert and repeatedly sought
to slash funding for global health pro-
grams. Sadly, Trump’s default response
to epidemics and barriers of exclusion,
defunding preventive measures, and
opting to feed panic rather than deploy
an orderly response that is driven by
science and led by scientists only hurts
our ability to control outbreaks that
are present today and in the future.
Finally, Denmark. Trump managed
to even screw up our relationship with
Denmark, which many of us would
have thought was impossible. Out of an
episode of ‘‘The Simpsons,’’ Trump
canceled a diplomatic meeting with
Denmark’s leader because they
wouldn’t agree to sell us Greenland. It
sounds funny, but it is an example of
the relatively small things compared
to the big world screw-ups that happen
every day that only get a few days of
media attention.
Denmark is one of our strongest
NATO allies. At the height of the war
in Afghanistan, they had one of the
highest numbers of troops per capita
fighting alongside us. They hold the
key to blocking a Russian gas pipeline
that could avoid Ukraine, damaging
their economy, and come into Europe,
but now we have managed to even
make Denmark an adversary. I know it
sounds implausible, but this is just the
tip of the iceberg. It is a policy mas-
sacre everywhere. The world is on fire,
and in most places Trump is one of the
arsonists. Meanwhile, who is bene-
fiting? Across the board, America’s en-
emies and our competitors are rubbing
their hands with delight as we score
own goal after own goal. Putin, Xi,
Erdogan, Kim, the hard-liners in Iran,
could not have scripted a better oppor-
tunity to gain power for themselves at
our expense.
I say that Trump’s foreign policy is a
global joke, but calling what he does
policy is probably unfair. He doesn’t
really care to take the time to learn
about the world. He doesn’t read his

briefings. He makes it up day by day,
with his personal political priorities,
his jealousies, and his headline addic-
tion guiding his decisions rather than
anything connected to our actual na-
tional security interests. Our foreign
policy is in complete, utter, total melt-
down, and it is time for all of us to face
facts.
You can’t impeach a President be-
cause you disagree with their policies,
but this is beyond a policy disagree-
ment. This is a President who has com-
promised our Nation’s integrity and
our credibility, who has put in jeop-
ardy the safety of our citizens, espe-
cially as ISIS breaks out of detainment
and looks to regroup to threaten Amer-
ica again in Syria.
These kinds of things—the perversion
of the powers of the Presidency—are
not allowed in a democracy. Our re-
fusal to accept this kind of behavior is
what separates us from all the tin-pot
dictatorships around the world.
I hope, eventually, my Republican
colleagues see this, but I also want my
Republican colleagues who spend their
time thinking of themselves as bul-
warks of national security to see the
damage, much of it irreparable, that
Trump is doing to our position in the
world. Why continue to offer him this
unconditional protection from an im-
peachment inquiry if the cost of his
staying in office is the shattering of
our reputation around the world?
Why continue to defend him if his ac-
tions everywhere are causing the world
to fall apart—and it is falling apart in
every part of the globe. Everything
this administration has touched has
gotten worse. The scariest part is that
this President and this administration
still have 14 more months to do even
more damage.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). The Senator from Oklahoma.
TURKEY AND SYRIA
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, let
me take you back to December 2016. We
are all getting ready for Christmas. It
is a month after President Trump is
elected. He will not take his office for
another month after that, but in Tur-
key they are reeling from a coup at-
tempt that happened in October. Hun-
dreds of people were killed—chaos.
Turkish President Erdogan over-
reacted, locking up hundreds of thou-
sands of people, including one of our
pastors, Pastor Andrew Brunson, and
implementing martial law, which was
kept in place for years after that. Rap-
idly changing the Constitution, he has
transitioned himself from a President
duly elected and operating a free de-
mocracy that has been Turkey to radi-
cally changing the direction of the
country in the future. A long-term
NATO ally is going through real tur-
moil.
In October that coup happened, and
all the transition was occurring, but by
December, as I mentioned before, they
were rocked again. On December 17,
2016, a bus was stopped at a red light
near a campus in Turkey when a car
bomb exploded, killing members of the
Turkish military. Thirteen people were
killed and 55 were wounded in that
blast. Forty-eight of those killed and
wounded were off-duty military per-
sonnel, most of them privates and cor-
porals.
The same day, at another location in
a different part of that community,
still in Turkey, there was a soccer sta-
dium attack that happened. In that at-
tack, 44 people died and more than 150
people were wounded. Three days
later—actually two days after that, De-
cember 19, 2016, the Russian Ambas-
sador to Turkey was assassinated in
Ankara while he was giving a public
speech.
Most Americans don’t know this be-
cause we were getting ready for Christ-
mas, and we were watching the transi-
tion of President Obama to President
Trump. There was a lot of chaos that
was happening in that region at that
time. I happened to be in Turkey when
all of that was going on, meeting with
Turkish officials, trying to negotiate
for the release of Andrew Brunson,
working toward our ongoing relation-
ship and trying to figure out what di-
rection Turkey was going to go because
they have been a longstanding ally to
the United States and a NATO partner,
but they certainly were not acting like
it in 2016, and now, in 2019, they are
certainly not acting like it.
The car bombs I mentioned and the
terrorist actions that happened might
surprise some Americans to know
weren’t led by ISIS fighters fighting in
Turkey. The innocents who were killed
that day were killed by Kurdish terror-
ists—Kurdish folks who had been listed
in the U.S. listing of official terrorist
organizations, a group called the
Kurdistan Workers Party, or the
PKK—the abbreviation in that lan-
guage. The PKK has been listed as a
terror organization by the United
States for decades.
Let me give some context. In the
course of the dialogue I have heard in
the last couple of weeks about the
Kurds and about the Turks, everyone
wants to seem to oversimplify this
issue. Everyone wants to say who are
the good guys and the bad guys, and
they are missing the point in the his-
tory of what is happening in this re-
gion.
The Kurds have 25 million people. It
is the fourth largest ethnic group in
the Middle East. They live mostly in
Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran, and Arme-
nia. They have all different political
parties, and they have all different
backgrounds. For over a century, they
have worked to have their own nation.
Interestingly enough, after World
War I and all of the changes on the
map after World War I, the Kurds were
promised their own country, the coun-
try of Kurdistan, because they were a
minority population for a long time in
that region. So they worked for and
pressed for their own country during
that time period. Yet, when the bound-
aries were drawn at the end of World
War I, after they had been promised
that they would have their homeland,
instead, a larger Turkey was drawn,
and the Kurds were just listed as a mi-
nority group inside of Turkey.
They face incredible persecution
within Turkey. They are not allowed to
call themselves Kurds. Instead, they
are called mountain Turks in that
area. They are not allowed to wear cer-
tain garb, and they are not allowed to
practice their customs. They are op-
pressed in every area. They have
worked for a long time and have asked:
How can we have a free people’s area?
For the Kurds who live in northern
Iraq, it is one of the freest areas in all
of the Middle East. They have the free-
dom of religion and a free capitalist
economy. It is a thriving economy in
northern Iraq. They have democrat-
ically led elections, and they worked
with us to overthrow Saddam Hussein
after Saddam Hussein gassed thousands
of Kurds to death in that Kurdish re-
gion of Iraq. They were gassed by Sad-
dam Hussein. They have been forced
out of their homes and have been iso-
lated, and for decades, they have
worked to have a free country.
In 2017, the Kurds who were in north-
ern Iraq had their own referendum to
be able to establish their own place.
They made a bold move and said: The
world will not acknowledge us; so we
will acknowledge ourselves. So, in a
bold referendum in September of 2017,
90 percent of the Kurds voted to form
their own country out of northern Iraq.
Quickly, the Iraqi Government moved
into that zone and squashed them.
In the middle of the conflict that we
have talked about before with ISIS,
ISIS moved into areas in Syria and in
Iraq and pressed in against the Kurds
in order to attack them. When the
Kurds were not able to establish their
homeland, ISIS was determined to es-
tablish its own caliphate and its own
land by beheading people and by mur-
dering thousands of people. As they
moved into the Kurdish area, the
Turks on the other side of the border
simply watched the refugees flee across
the border, for ISIS was not killing
Turks. It was killing Kurds, and they
didn’t care. The Turks would handle
the refugees as long as ISIS was doing
their bidding in Syria.
You see, this is a complicated issue
for us because there are sections of the
Kurds that have fought for democracy
for decades. Many of them have been
doing it in exactly the right way—in
having referendums, in organizing and
working with U.N. officials, and in
working with the countries around
them to demographically establish an
area in which they would be free to live
and to worship and to function in a
capitalist economy. That has been the
Kurds’ desire. There has also been an
offshoot of the Kurds, called the PKK,
that has for decades carried out car
bombs and attacks, many of them in
Turkey, where hundreds of civilians
have been killed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5821
October 16, 2019
President Erdogan, of Turkey, has
determined that all Kurds are the same
and has ruthlessly lashed out at them.
Now, I think about how we operated in
Afghanistan and how differently the
United States really thought about
military warfare. As the Taliban and
al-Qaida rose up in Afghanistan, we en-
gaged in the most Surgical way we pos-
sibly could with violent Taliban mem-
bers and with members of al-Qaida and
took the battle specifically to them
while we established a friendship and a
longstanding partnership with the Af-
ghan people.
We don’t look at all Afghans in the
same way, in some blanket declaration.
We understand that there is a violent
faction that has to be addressed for
world peace and that there are others
who just want their children to grow
up and go to school.
We have engaged them in a way that
is very different than how Turkey is
currently engaging them in the Turk-
ish population. As the battle raged in
Syria and finished out with the civil
war in Syria and the fight with ISIS off
the Kurdish areas, everyone knew,
when this calmed down, that at some
future date, the Turks would start
going after the Kurds. It has been
known for years. In fact, in 2016, when
I was in Ankara, Turkey, at that point
in December, and watched all of this
chaos occur, that was the ongoing dia-
logue among Turkish leaders at that
time—that they were going to go after
the Kurds. Over and over, this has been
the repetitive statement to the admin-
istration and, quite frankly, to the pre-
vious administration.
In a series of phone calls in which
President Erdogan talked to President
Trump and said, ‘‘We are crossing the
border and going in,’’ it left President
Trump in a very difficult situation.
Does he leave our American men and
women—a very small number—in a for-
ward operating base to sit there while
tanks roll by and the battle rages be-
tween the Kurds and the Turks? Do we
use them as some kind of tool to try to
stop this? Do we get out of harm’s way?
Secretary Esper just made a state-
ment last weekend that was very clear:
The Turks didn’t ask permission to
cross the border. They said, ‘‘We are
coming,’’ and notified us in advance so
that if we wanted to move out of the
way, we could, but either way, they
were coming.
We have moved our forces into other
areas and combined them into bases.
Just recently, within the last couple of
days, when the Turks started getting
closer to our combined forces in north-
ern Syria, we responded by putting up
Apache helicopters and F–16s in order
to fly by the Turks and say: Don’t you
dare come near American forces. At
the same time, we are trying to do ev-
erything that we can and should in
order to stop the bloodshed between
two allies.
I have been amazed at the number of
people who have stepped up and said
that President Trump is to blame for
all that is happening with the Kurdish
people and the Turks. They have ig-
nored the basic history of what has
happened in that region for a very long
time—for over a century—with regard
to the ongoing battle between the
Kurds and the Turks. We should do ev-
erything we can to push back on this,
because, for a large group of the Kurd-
ish population, especially those in
northern Iraq, they have been very
close allies and friends and tenacious
fighters against Saddam Hussein. They
left their own place of safety in north-
ern Iraq to help us fight the fight in
Syria—to protect other Kurdish people,
yes, but also to help protect the entire
world from the ruthless nature of ISIS.
We should engage and do what we can
to help stop the bloodshed. As I men-
tioned before, when we moved into Af-
ghanistan, we did it as surgically as we
could. When Turkey moved into the
Kurdish regions, it unleashed artillery
fire against civilians and pummeled
homes and businesses in the Kurdish
towns of people who meant them no
harm as they crossed the border into
Syria.
So what do we do? How do we respond
in the days ahead? There are a few
things I would bring up. One is the
‘‘what I wish.’’
I wish the administration had been
more clear with Turkey and her leaders
and would have said: If you do this, it
is not that we will impose sanctions,
but here is exactly what the sanctions
will be. We need you to know it, and it
is going to happen as rapidly as pos-
sible.
I wish that we would have moved all
of the ISIS fighters out of the region.
There are ISIS fighters who are cur-
rently imprisoned in northern Syria
who are waiting to return back to their
home countries, for many of them are
foreign fighters from other places. Yet
their home countries are not willing to
take them back. So they are currently
imprisoned in Syria. I wish, before the
Turks crossed the border, that we
would have done more to help to pro-
tect those prisoners and make sure
they didn’t get freed. Many of them did
get freed, and the entire region will
suffer the consequences of some very
bad actors who will get back to the
battlefield again because of that.
I wish there had actually been co-
ordination. Clearly, the administration
did not coordinate with the State De-
partment, the Department of Defense,
and with other Kurdish leaders with re-
gard to what was happening in the re-
gion and did not make sure we were se-
curing those fighters and preparing for
that moment. Instead, it was a rapid
transition and a hurried process to
move Americans out of harm’s way in
between two allies who were fighting
each other and to try to shift them to
other places and be able to stabilize
them in those locations. There have
been a lot of hurried responses that
could have been done differently but
were not.
The ‘‘now whats’’ are pretty clear,
though.
President Trump has launched out
and stated very clearly that there will
be strong sanctions against military
leaders within the Turkish Army and
the key leaders in the government. He
will try to put sanctions down as rap-
idly as possible on those individuals.
He has also announced a 50-percent
steel tariff on Turkey. You may say
that it is no big deal, except for the
fact that steel is a major export for
Turkey, and it is a punishing tariff on
it as a country.
He has also started laying down addi-
tional sanctions on Turkey and has
said all of the trade agreements and
conversations are currently at a stand-
still. Turkey’s economy is on the ra-
zor’s edge because Erdogan has so mis-
managed its economy for so many
years.
We have no beef with the Turkish
people, but, currently, Turkey is being
led by a leader who is leading their
country into economic ruin and leading
their military across foreign borders to
haphazardly kill civilians. We should
not tolerate that, and we should en-
gage. We should make it very clear
that there will be consequences.
We should work with the U.N., as we
already have started, and be more ag-
gressive, by which, if there is someone
to stand between two warring parties,
it will be the U.N. peacekeepers who
will do that, not American men and
women who are sitting out there in a
forward operating base.
We should continue to sanction
Turkish banks—those banks that did
business with Iran. When Iran was
sanctioned, Turkey continued to do
business with some of those banks. We
should increase our sanctions there.
We should be extremely clear that
Turkey will not get access to the F–35s.
I cannot imagine how much stronger
the response of the American people
would be right now if it were American
F–35s that were flying across the Syria-
Turkey border to bomb our own allies
the Kurds. We should make it very
clear that there is no foreign military
sales to Turkey, and we should con-
tinue to cut them off.
We have to be clear in the con-
sequences. We have to be rapid in the
response because, right now, people are
dying in northern Syria. Those same
families and those same individuals
put their own lives on the line to stand
up against ISIS, and they stood with us
in multiple areas. They have a great
propensity toward freedom and toward
democracy, which desperately need to
grow in the Middle East.
The chaos that is ensuing is the
chaos of war. It is the pain of over a
century of the mismanagement of this
entire region. We need to stop the
bloodshed first and continue to nego-
tiate with every possible lever that we
can to make sure we can bring a sense
of calm to the chaos that is starting
and do so with the greatest pressure on
the Turks and on President Erdogan,
who clearly hasn’t gotten the message
yet as to what the will of the American

people and this Congress really in-

This is a changing situation. It is not
simple, but it is one about which I will
come back and try to inform in every
way that I can. In order to bring jus-
tice to the process, I will encourage
this body to smartly and quickly en-

war crimes against any Turk or any in-
dividual we can identify who is killing

I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from the Nebraska.
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise
to voice my strong support for the pas-
sage of the United States-Mexico-Can-
ada Agreement, or the USMCA.
When I travel the State of Nebraska,
I always hear directly from our farmers
and our ag producers. Nebraska’s farm-
ers have endured some of the most
challenging setbacks in recent mem-
ory. The severe flooding from last
spring devastated thousands of acres of
our farm and our ranch land, brought
hundreds of livestock deaths, and de-
stroyed barns, countless grain bins,
hay, and critical farm equipment. This
list of daunting obstacles continues to
grow.
Last July, the Gering-Fort Laramie-
Goshen irrigation tunnel collapsed and
cut off a crucial source of surface irri-
gation water to the western region of
our State for several weeks.
Only a few days earlier, a devastating
fire broke out in a Tyson beef proc-
essing plant in Holcomb, KS. The plant
processed about 6,000 head of cattle
every single day. That is roughly 6 per-
cent of the total fed cattle processing
capacity in the United States.
The effects of the plant’s closure rip-
pled throughout the entire cattle in-
dustry and the beef processing chain.
This is all in addition to 5 years of low
commodity prices, the unfair small re-
finery exemptions for oil refiners, and
the cloud of uncertainty over trade.
While all of these factors have caused
anxiety and unpredictability, there is
one solution that Nebraska’s farmers,
ranchers, ag producers, manufacturers,
and hard-working men and women have
made clear, and that is the passage of
the USMCA.
Nebraska’s farmers and ranchers
have a different lifestyle than most
people. Their patience is steadfast.
They plan for the long term. They can
envision how they want their land to
look, not only next year but 100 years
into the future. It is in their DNA, and
families are fed around the world be-
cause of it.
They are optimists, but they are re-
alists. As Secretary Perdue recently
said, ‘‘they know you can’t plant in
August and harvest in September.’’
That is exactly right. Our producers
have remained patient during these
tough and turbulent times because
they know that there is an opportunity
for a better, long-term trade solution
on the horizon.
The USMCA would replace the 25-
year-old North American Free Trade
Agreement, or NAFTA, and bring the
deal into the 21st century, while for-
tifying our strong trading relationships
with Canada and Mexico and growing
critical market access for Nebraska.
The heart of Nebraska beats in the
same rhythm as agriculture. It is who
we are, and as the world knows that it
is what we do better than anyone. So it
is not hard to understand why our
State needs this deal.
America’s neighbors to the north and
south are the destination of 44 percent
of Nebraska’s total exports. In 2017, Ne-
braska shipped $447 million of agricul-
tural products to Canada and a stag-
gering $898 million to Mexico. These
exports include hundreds of millions of
dollars’ worth of Nebraska’s high-qual-
ity corn, soybeans, ethanol, and beef.
Specifically, the USMCA maintains
and strengthens those markets for corn
and soybeans. It also allows U.S. beef
producers to continue to grow their ex-
ports to Mexico, which have risen 800
percent since NAFTA was first ratified.
In 2018 alone, Nebraska exported over
$250 million dollars of beef to both
countries.
It is important to note that the bene-
fits of the USMCA extend far beyond
our farmland. Agricultural trade be-
tween Canada and Mexico supports
nearly 54,000 jobs in the State of Ne-
braska. According to the Nebraska De-
partment of Agriculture, Nebraska’s
$6.4 billion in agricultural exports in
2017 translated into $8.19 billion in ad-
ditional economic activity. For the
good of our State and our Nation, these
markets need to be protected.
The USMCA goes even further than
NAFTA. It adopts labor and environ-
mental standards that Democrats have
long advocated for. It requires that 40
to 45 percent of auto content be made
by workers who earn at least $16 an
hour by 2023. This will undoubtedly
help close the gap in labor standards
between our Nation and Mexico.
According to the U.S. Trade Rep-
resentative, the deal includes new pro-
visions to prohibit the importation of
goods produced by forced labor.
The USMCA addresses violence
against workers exercising their labor
rights, and it ensures that migrant
workers are protected under labor
laws.
The deal brings labor obligations into
the core of the agreement, and most
importantly, it makes them fully en-
forceable.
On top of that, the USMCA deploys
the most advanced, comprehensive set
of environmental protections of any
trade agreement in our Nation’s his-
tory. The list of environmental protec-
tions includes first-ever articles to im-
prove air quality, support forest man-
agement, and ensure procedures for
studies on its environmental impact.
New provisions protect a variety of
marine species, such as whales and sea
turtles, and there are prohibitions on
shark finning.
Unlike NAFTA, the USMCA provides
enforcement mechanisms that will en-
sure that all countries not only meet
but strengthen their environmental re-
sponsibilities.
Lastly, I want to point out to my
Democrat colleagues the support the
USMCA is receiving on both sides of
the aisle.
I recently heard Tom Vilsack say
this:
I think under any evaluation, from the
U.S. agriculture perspective it clearly is a
better deal. So, with that our hope is that it
gets done, and gets done soon.
These are not the words of some
Trump administration official. These
are the words of President Obama’s
former Secretary of Agriculture.
Here is another quote from Dan
Glickman:
We have a good agreement. We cannot let
the perfect be the enemy of the good. This is
a good deal for America and particularly a
good deal for farmers at this vulnerable
time.
Again, this isn’t support from some
Republican Member of Congress. This
is support that is voiced by President
Clinton’s former Secretary of Agri-
culture.
What is more, all former Agriculture
Secretaries since the Reagan adminis-
tration have voiced their full support
for the USMCA.
We have seen the headlines of en-
dorsements, and one especially caught
my attention. The title of a recent op-
ed read: ‘‘Democrats Should Give
Trump a Win on His Trade Deal with
Mexico and Canada.’’ Well, this piece
wasn’t composed by a conservative
publication. It was penned by the edi-
torial board of the Washington Post.
Finally, a group of 14 House Demo-
crats sent a letter to Speaker PELOSI
last July urging her to take up the
USMCA for a vote.
The letter reads: ‘‘Canada and Mexico
are by far our most important trading
partners, and we need to restore cer-
tainty in these critical relationships
that support millions of American
jobs.’’
Both sides of the aisle agree that the
USMCA is a significant win for farm-
ers, ranchers, ag producers, and Amer-
ica’s economy as a whole.
Nebraska’s farmers and ranchers
have maintained patience in these
tough times. They deserve to know
without a doubt that they will con-
tinue to have access to their two larg-
est markets and closest trading part-
ners.
As I said earlier, farmers aren’t just
thinking about themselves. They are
planning for the future generations
that will proudly carry on their life’s
work and continue feeding our world.
Right now, we have an opportunity
to come together around a common-
sense, bipartisan agreement that will
benefit the American people both now
and for years to come. Now it is up to
Congress to deliver.
I urge Speaker PELOSI to stop need-
lessly delaying this vote, and I encour-
age all of my Democrat colleagues not

to allow politics to stand in the way of
sound policy. It is time to push the
USMCA over the finish line.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska.
Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, first I
would like to associate myself with the
comments of my senior Senator about
the necessity of the passage of the
USMCA. The House of Representatives
and the Speaker should schedule that
vote immediately. There is clearly
overwhelming support in both bodies
for its passage.
I would also like to underscore my
senior Senator’s comments about the
tragedy of the irrigation tunnel col-
lapse in Nebraska and about the char-
acter of Nebraska’s farmers and ranch-
ers. They have dealt with yet another
catastrophe after 81 of our 93 counties
went through a state of emergency ear-
lier this year in a flood.
I would like to just commend my sen-
ior Senator for a fine speech on a really
important topic.
(The remarks of Mr. SASSE per-
taining to the submission of S.J. Res.
58 are printed in today’s RECORD under
‘‘Submitted Resolutions.’’)
Mr. SASSE. I yield back.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
measure will be received and appro-
priately referred.
The Senator from Maryland.
S.J. RES. 53
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I come
to the floor to talk about S.J. Res. 53.
We will have a chance to vote on that
tomorrow. I am joined by my colleague
from Maryland, Senator VAN HOLLEN,
and my colleague on the Environment
and Public Works Committee, Senator
WHITEHOUSE from Rhode Island. I also
want to thank Senator CARPER for his
leadership as the senior Democrat on
the Environment and Public Works
Committee in regard to this resolution.
This resolution will be voted on to-
morrow. It deals with the CRA—Con-
gressional Review Act—vote in regard
to the Trump administration’s afford-
able clean energy rule. That is prob-
ably a misnomer. It is what I call the
dirty powerplant rule. The CRA would
repeal that so that we can go back to
the Clean Power Plan that was promul-
gated under the Obama administration
in 2015.
Let me explain what the Trump-era
rule would do. First, it would repeal
the Clean Power Plan that was issued
in 2015. That plan had real results in it.
It set limits on a powerplant’s produc-
tion of dangerous carbon. It made
meaningful progress. The rule promul-
gated by President Trump’s adminis-
tration would repeal that and sub-
stitute it with a plan that would be a
powerplant judgment in each power-
plant—coal-burning only—and would
not take into consideration the power-
plant mix of individual States.
The previous rule allowed the States
to figure out how to reach those goals.
So a State could do a mix. They could
start using natural gas. They could
start using renewable energy. They
could meet their goals that are set
with a reduction of about one-third of
these dangerous carbon emissions but
with local discretion on how to reach
those goals.
The rule that was promulgated that I
am seeking to reverse allows only effi-
ciency per coal powerplants, does not
allow the mixing of the different tech-
nologies, and prohibits the States from
pursuing market-based plans.
I am going to tell you, in my region
of the country, we have what is known
as REGI, which is a compact to reduce
carbon emissions. We do it by ener-
gizing market forces so that we can get
to friendlier sources of energy, which,
by the way, has helped our region not
only reduce carbon emissions but cre-
ate green energy jobs, which is in our
interest.
Let me point out from the beginning
that the powerplants are the largest
stationary source of harmful carbon
emissions. Why should everybody be
concerned about it? We know its im-
pact on climate change. We have seen
the harmful impacts of climate change
in America, from the wildfires out
West to the flooding here in the East.
We have seen the problems not only in
our own community but throughout
the world. In my own State of Mary-
land, we have had two 100-year floods
within 20 months in Ellicott City, MD.
The list goes on and on about the im-
pact of climate change. We see the
coastal line changing in our lifetime.
We are seeing regular flooding. We are
seeing habitable land become inhabit-
able. All of that is affected by our car-
bon emissions, and the Obama-era
Clean Power Plan did something about
it. The rule that we will have a chance
to vote on tomorrow would do nothing
about it.
We see this as a public health risk. I
can’t tell you how frequently I have
heard from my constituents who have
someone in their family who has a res-
piratory illness: What can we do for
cleaner air? Children are staying home
from school because of bad air days.
Parents are missing time from work.
Premature deaths. All that is impacted
by clean air.
I talk frequently about the Chesa-
peake Bay. I am honored to represent
the Chesapeake Bay region in the U.S.
Senate, along with Senator VAN HOL-
LEN, and we treasure the work that has
been done. It has been an international
model of all the stakeholders coming
together in order to clean up the
Chesapeake Bay, and we are making
tremendous progress on dealing with
the sorts of pollution coming from run-
off or from farming activities or devel-
opment. But, quite frankly, we have
not been successful in dealing with air-
borne pollutants that are going into
the Chesapeake Bay.
In Maryland, we are a downwind
State. We need a national effort here.
Maryland could be doing everything
right, but if the surrounding States are
not, we suffer the consequences. That
is why the Clean Power Plan was so at-
tractive in dealing with this issue, be-
cause it dealt with it with national
goals. Establish how to attain them by
the local governments. That is the way
it should be.
Let me give the numbers. The Clean
Power Plan that is repealed by the rule
under the Trump administration would
have reduced dangerous carbon emis-
sion by about one-third. We believe the
rule that was promulgated by the
Trump administration could actually
increase dangerous emissions.
Let me use EPA’s regulatory impact
analysis. Looking at CO2—carbon diox-
ide—the Agency says that the Trump
rule will reduce it by 0.7 percent. That
is less than 1 percent. The Clean Power
Plan issued by President Obama—19
percent. SO2s under Trump are 5.7 per-
cent; under the Obama rule, 24 percent.
NOX emissions under the plan that was
promulgated under the Trump adminis-
tration are 0.9 percent—less than 1 per-
cent. Under the Clean Power Plan, it is
22 percent.
We really are talking about whether
we are serious about dealing with dan-
gerous carbon emissions or whether we
are going to at best maintain the sta-
tus quo; at worst, make things even
worse.
It saddens me that my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle are embrac-
ing the ACE rule, since it threatens to
reverse much of the progress we have
made in reducing air pollution—
progress their conservationist Repub-
lican predecessors helped to spur. The
Clean Air Act amendments, which es-
tablished the sulfur dioxide—SO2—cap-
and-trade program, were adopted in
1990. This was never a partisan issue;
cap-and-trade was originally a Repub-
lican idea. George Herbert Walker Bush
was President. It passed the House of
Representatives by a 401-to-21 vote. It
passed this body, the U.S. Senate, by
an 89-to-11 vote. It has been highly suc-
cessful. During George W. Bush’s Presi-
dency, the EPA determined that the
SO2 cap-and-trade program had a 40–1
benefit-to-cost ratio.
The Supreme Court held in Massa-
chusetts v. EPA that the EPA has a re-
sponsibility to regulate these carbon
emissions. So that is exactly what was
done in 2015, which is now being jeop-
ardized because of the regulation that
was issued under the Trump adminis-
tration.
I had a chance to serve in the State
legislature. This is an affront to fed-
eralism. Innovation for green energy
and jobs is prohibited under the rule
that I am seeking to repeal. It is pro-
hibited. That is why 22 States and 7
local governments have filed suit
against this regulation. But we can
act.
The Congressional Review Act allows
us to take action in this body, and that
is why I filed that so we can take ac-
tion. If we allow this rule to go for-
ward, it will delay the implementation
of carbon emission reductions—delay
it. If we vote for the CRA, we will be
back on track.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5824 October 16, 2019
We have already seen the U.S. leader-
ship challenged in this area with Presi-
dent Trump’s decision to withdraw
from the Paris accord—the only nation
in the world that has done so. Who has
filled that void? Quite frankly, it has
been China.
Do we want to cede our leadership
globally to a country with a controlled
government economy like China or do
we want to reassert U.S. leadership?
We are going to have a chance to do
that tomorrow with a vote in the U.S.
Senate. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the Congressional Review Act res-
olution I have filed, S.J. Res. 53.
With that, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I
would like to start by thanking my
friend and colleague from the State of
Maryland, Senator CARDIN, for bringing
this resolution to the floor of the Sen-
ate—as he said, we will be voting on it
tomorrow—but also for his long-
standing support and efforts in trying
to protect our environment, to protect
the Chesapeake Bay, and to address the
urgent issue of climate change, which
anybody with eyes can see is already
having a devastating impact on com-
munities throughout our country and,
indeed, throughout the world.
I am also very pleased to be here
with our colleague, the Senator from
Rhode Island, Mr. WHITEHOUSE, who
has made this such an important cause
and has kept the Senate focused on
this pressing issue.
As Senator CARDIN indicated, under
the previous administration, under the
leadership of President Obama, as a
country we adopted something known
as the Clean Power Plan rule. This was
a historic step forward. It was a blue-
print to create more good-paying jobs
in the clean energy sector. In fact, we
have seen a tremendous growth of
those jobs in the area of solar and wind
power and other jobs.
That Clean Power Plan rule, under
the Obama administration, also really
addressed the issue of carbon pollution
in the atmosphere, beginning to reduce
it significantly, to offset the damage
and real costs we are already experi-
encing in communities from that cli-
mate change.
As Senator CARDIN said, this is an
area where there are huge commu-
nities, if our country moves forward, in
the area of clean energy jobs. Right
now, with this new Trump administra-
tion action, we are ceding the playing
field to China, which is happily seizing
the initiative and moving forward and
creating more and more jobs in the
clean energy sector. If we don’t wake
up, we are going to lose that important
global competition in the vital sector
to China, which has established a goal
of dominating the area of clean energy
technologies by 2025.
Instead of building on the progress of
the Obama administration, on June 19,
the Trump administration decided to
repeal and roll back these important
rules that have been put in place and
substitute them with something that,
in the worst case, actually makes the
situation much worse than even before
these Trump rules and, at the very
least, is a huge retreat from the
progress we were headed toward under
the rules of the previous administra-
tion.
Let me just point out the analysis
that was done by a very good organiza-
tion called Resources for the Future.
They looked at their analysis of this
Trump proposal, which I agree with
Senator CARDIN is better termed the
‘‘Trump dirty power plan,’’ and they
concluded it would do very little, if
anything, to address climate change
and would have an adverse air quality
impact in many of our States.
Some people may recall when the
Trump version of this power plan, the
‘‘dirty power plan,’’ was released last
year, people looked at the EPA’s own
analysis of that rule, and it showed
that 1,630 of our fellow Americans
would die prematurely under the
Trump provisions compared to the
Obama-era provisions.
So when the Trump administration
released this most recent version of
their amended plan back in June, they
made it really difficult to put together
all the data so people would not be able
to connect the dots in many of these
areas, but Senator CARDIN has pre-
sented some of the results of this. I
want to emphasize those and put them
in somewhat different terms, which is,
what does the Trump rule accomplish
compared to the Obama rule on some of
these issues?
So with respect to carbon dioxide
emissions, the Trump rule would re-
duce carbon dioxide emissions, carbon
pollution emissions, by 2.7 percent of
what the Obama administration would
have done—2.7 percent of what the rule
they are replacing would have done.
With respect to sulfur dioxide, the
Trump plan reduces sulfur dioxide
emissions by only 1.9 percent of what
the Obama administration’s rule would
have done.
When it comes to nitrous oxide, the
Trump proposal, the Trump plan, re-
duces nitrous oxide by only 2.5 percent
compared to what the Obama provi-
sions would have done.
If you take all of these together, you
can see it is a really anemic proposal
that takes us way backward compared
to where we were. That is why I sup-
port Senator CARDIN’s efforts on the
floor, with the vote tomorrow, to say
no, to say no to the Trump administra-
tion’s efforts to roll back the progress
on clean air, to roll back the progress
on clean water because a lot of that
pollution settles in places like the
Chesapeake Bay, and to roll back
progress on climate change, which we
know is hitting our communities as we
speak.
I want to give some additional Mary-
land examples here. The Baltimore Sun
ran a story a little while back about
the staggering costs that Maryland and
Marylanders would have to pay to
build seawalls to protect communities
from sea level rise. A study from the
Institute for Governance & Sustainable
Development found that in the coming
decades, seawalls to protect thousands
of homes, businesses, and farmlands
from Ocean City to Baltimore City will
cost more than $27 billion—$27 billion.
We have also seen dramatic flooding
in the city of Annapolis that is already
hurting the Naval Academy. This past
week, we just had a famous national
boat show, and in the middle of this
boat show, there was huge flooding in
the city of Annapolis. The costs to the
city and that community are rising
rapidly and have been well-docu-
mented.
I ask my colleagues to support Sen-
ator CARDIN’s motion. Let’s not go
backward. Let’s not go backward in
terms of protecting our air. Let’s not
go backward in terms of the battle
against climate change because going
backward means less good jobs in
America, it means more dirty air and
more asthma, and it means ceding this
important area to China and others in
the global economy.
I urge my colleagues to support the
motion of Senator CARDIN.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
BLACKBURN). The Senator from Rhode
Island.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the
vote be extended until 4:30 p.m.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Seeing none, without objection, it is
so ordered.
S.J. RES. 53
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I am delighted to join my col-
leagues from Maryland and Delaware
to support this resolution expressing
disapproval of the Trump administra-
tion rescinding the Clean Power Plan
and replacing it with its so-called af-
fordable clean energy rule, which is a
name fanciful enough to make George
Orwell blush.
The first thing to understand about
the so-called affordable clean energy
rule is that it is a do-nothing rule, ex-
actly as the polluters wish. EPA ad-
mits its own rule would do virtually
zero to reduce carbon pollution. It re-
quires zero emissions reductions at
natural gas-fired powerplants, and it
would allow coal-fired powerplants to
make minor efficiency improvements
and then run for longer hours. That
could actually lead to an increase in
carbon pollution.
This rule is designed to fool people
into thinking that the Trump adminis-
tration is obeying the Clean Air Act,
but no one should be fooled.
From the get-go, the Trump adminis-
tration made clear it didn’t care about
cutting carbon pollution, fighting cli-
mate change, or protecting the envi-
ronment or public health. It cared
about obeying the fossil fuel industry,
not the law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5825
October 16, 2019
Within weeks of taking office,
Trump’s swampy Cabinet rolled out the
red carpet for coal baron Bob Murray,
who had an action plan for the admin-
istration. Here is Murray with Energy
Secretary Perry, and look who is ac-
companying Murray at the meeting,
our EPA Administrator, Andrew
Wheeler, then Murray’s lobbyist. It
looks like a friendly meeting, and why
wouldn’t it be? Look at that, such a
nice big hug. Isn’t that sweet?
Murray was the major financial
backer of the Trump administration,
and this was his payback time. Individ-
uals associated with Murray Energy
were the largest source of donations to
Donald Trump’s Presidential cam-
paign, and Murray himself chipped in a
cool 300 grand for Trump’s inaugural
festivities. Murray was also one of the
largest donors to election spending
groups associated with disgraced EPA
Administrator Scott Pruitt, under
whose tenure this botched ACE rule
began.
So what was the first item on Bob
Murray’s action plan? To get rid of the
Clean Power Plan. Bob Murray wasn’t
the only one who wanted to scrap the
Clean Power Plan. The U.S. Chamber of
Commerce and the National Associa-
tion of Manufacturers, two of the larg-
est and most powerful trade associa-
tions in Washington, also asked the
EPA to scrap the Clean Power Plan.
That is no surprise. The independent
watchdog group InfluenceMap found
the chamber and NAM the two worst
obstructers of climate action. They
will not reveal their donors, but I be-
lieve they took lots of money from the
fossil fuel industry and became its
mouthpiece. They got paid, and this
was the play.
The chamber and NAM were also
aligned with shadowy fossil fuel indus-
try front groups like the so-called Util-
ity Air Regulatory Group and the
American Council for Clean Coal Elec-
tricity—more Orwellian names. These
groups also asked the EPA to scrap the
Clean Power Plan and replace it with
this toothless rule.
Is that unsavory enough? It gets
worse. Guess who represented UARG,
that Utility Air Regulatory Group. It
was none other than fossil fuel indus-
try stooge Bill Wehrum, who helped or-
chestrate a web of front groups, like
UARG, which obscured and multiplied
the influence of Wehrum’s polluter cli-
ents—clients responsible for massive
carbon pollution.
Naturally, Trump put this guy in as
head of EPA’s Air Office. Before
Wehrum headed for the exits this sum-
mer, Murray’s man Wheeler praised
Wehrum for ‘‘tremendous progress’’ in
repealing climate regulations. Pruitt
to Wheeler to Wehrum—this is rank
fossil fuel crookedness in plain view.
Several of us submitted comments
laying out the financial and profes-
sional connections between the Trump
officials who developed this bogus rule
and the fossil fuel industry that asked
for it. Those comments are posted on-
line and in the Federal Register. I urge
you to have a look. Also available on-
line is a report I did with Senator CAR-
PER detailing Wehrum’s industry ties
and conflicts of interest. Median.com/
@senwhitehouse will link you to all of
this.
The crony capture of EPA is not the
only problem with the rule. The indus-
try is so greedy and its hacks are so
clumsy that they don’t bother to align
the rule with the scientific and eco-
nomic evidence.
In court, Agency actions will be
found to be arbitrary and capricious—
and therefore invalid—if they are not
the product of reasoned decision mak-
ing.
In this case, it is clear that the EPA
ignored the science, ignored the eco-
nomics, and produced exactly what the
fossil fuel industry told it to do: a do-
nothing rule that took good care of the
coal and natural gas industries.
What does the science tell us? Ac-
cording to the world’s best scientific
report, if we reduce carbon pollution by
roughly half by around 2030 and reach
net zero emissions sometime around
the middle of the century, we stand a
chance to hold the global average tem-
perature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Our own best scientists warn that if
we don’t limit carbon pollution, we will
be hit with economic losses in the hun-
dreds of billions of dollars per year by
the end of the century. Legions of
economists, investment banks, asset
managers, central banks, credit rating
agencies, and other experts warn of se-
rious economic risks from climate up-
heaval. Here is a summary of just some
of these warnings, which I have deliv-
ered to every colleague in the Senate.
That, too, can be found on that Me-
dium page.
Pruitt, Wehrum, and Wheeler ignored
all of this for their do-nothing rule.
The only voice that mattered was the
polluter industry that they came from
and will go back to in an oil-greased re-
volving door. This ACE rule is the
exact opposite of reasoned decision
making. But that was never the point.
The fix was in. Even a bogus rule that
courts throw out buys this crooked and
corrupting industry time—time to keep
polluting, time to burn through re-
serves, and time to use its political
muscle to fend off action here in the
Senate. If you are in the fiddling busi-
ness and fiddle for money, fiddling
while Rome burns is a fine economic
proposition for you.
The Supreme Court has ruled that
greenhouse gases are pollutants under
the Clean Air Act. The EPA has found
that greenhouse gases from power-
plants endanger human health and wel-
fare. Those determinations mean the
EPA must limit carbon pollution, con-
sistent with the law. This masquerade
of a rule fails to do this, so it must be
replaced with something effective, as a
matter of law.
I ask colleagues to think carefully
about their vote on this resolution. Do
you want to endorse this record of ob-
vious industry capture? Do you want to
side with this corrupting industry over
your own constituents’ health and safe-
ty? Do you want to go on record ignor-
ing all the warnings from the Bank of
England, from Freddie Mac, from Nobel
Prize-winning economists, and from
hundreds of our own government’s
most knowledgeable experts?
The fossil fuel industry—its voice full
of money, as F. Scott Fitzgerald might
say—has drowned out the voices of ev-
eryone else for too long here. But you
can’t shout down the laws of physics.
You can’t shout down the laws of biol-
ogy, chemistry, and economics. Those
laws will have their way, and we have
been well warned. So, please, let’s turn
the corner to a brighter day where de-
cency rules, not industry political
thuggery; a brighter day where facts
and science matter more than dark
money and paid-for denial; and a
brighter day where we don’t give our
grandchildren daily cause for shame. It
is time to wake up, and this vote is a
chance to do so.
I yield the floor.

HONG KONG
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, as
we speak, the brave people of Hong
Kong are demonstrating to protect
their freedoms from the Chinese Com-
munist Party in Beijing. Chinese state
TV has portrayed these millions of
demonstrators as violent anarchists
and separatists, but these Hongkongers
are merely insisting that China live up
to the promises it made to Hong Kong
and the United Kingdom—promises
China made as binding conditions of
the transfer of sovereignty from Lon-
don to Beijing.
The Chinese Government promised
that Hong Kong would enjoy a high de-
gree of autonomy, including many of
the freedoms that Beijing denies to its
more than 1 billion subjects on the
mainland, but, as the world has learned
through bitter experience, the Chinese
Communist Party’s promises aren’t
worth the paper they are written on.
Slowly but surely, Beijing has chipped
away at the independence it promised
Hong Kong—disappearing citizens
guilty of wrongthink, undermining
Hong Kong’s longstanding political and
judicial systems, and issuing menacing
threats of military intervention to
crush the demonstrations.
Most Americans are rightly outraged
by China’s brutal crackdown in Hong
Kong. Daryl Morey is one of them. He
is the general manager of the Houston
Rockets. Just a few days ago, he
tweeted a simple and justified phrase:
‘‘Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong
Kong.’’
Morey probably knew his words
would offend the Chinese Communist
Party, but he was also violating a dif-
ferent party line—that of his own
league, the NBA. For daring to speak
up about Hong Kong, Morey was dis-
avowed by his team, his fellow execu-
tives, and some of the most famous

athletes in the NBA. That is because he
was threatening not only the powers
that be in China but the cash cow that
China represents for American busi-
ness, including professional basketball.
China’s government may be red, but its
money is green, and plenty of people
are willing to cash its checks, no mat-
ter the cost.
The league’s biggest star, LeBron
James, said that Morey’s support for
Hong Kong was ‘‘misinformed’’ and
‘‘not educated.’’ He reportedly called
for Morey to be punished. Perhaps it is
no coincidence that LeBron James
stands to make billions of dollars from
the Chinese market—not only from a
higher NBA salary cap, shoe sales, and
Nike ads, but also from his own movie
company. Often known as King James,
perhaps ‘‘Chairman LeBron’’ would be
a better honorific today.
Joe Tsai, owner of the Brooklyn
Nets, called the protest in Hong Kong a
separatist movement that was trying
to carve up Chinese territories like co-
lonial powers or Imperial Japan. Per-
haps it is no coincidence that Mr. Tsai
is an executive at Alibaba, a Chinese
company that developed a Communist
propaganda app that hijacked cell
phones of anyone who downloaded it.
At a Wizards game last week, secu-
rity confiscated a protest sign that
said simply ‘‘Google Uighurs,’’ refer-
ring to the native people of western
China whose culture and religion are
being exterminated by the Chinese
Communist Party. That sign was not
confiscated in China by the secret po-
lice but right here in America’s na-
tional capital.
Steve Kerr, the head coach of the
Golden State Warriors, drew a moral
equivalence between Communist China
and the United States. ‘‘None of us are
perfect,’’ he said, ‘‘and we all have dif-
ferent issues we need to get to.’’
Nobody is perfect. That is what he
says of an authoritarian regime that
starved, shot, or beat to death 50 mil-
lion of its own people on a forced
march to modernity and a regime that
runs a network of concentration camps
in its western provinces and harvests
the organs of political prisoners for its
own pampered elite. Nobody is perfect,
indeed.
This is craven and greedy behavior,
and it stands in stark contrast to how
America has historically used sports to
promote our interests and our aspira-
tions, from the triumph of Black Olym-
pians in Hitler’s Germany to the Mir-
acle on Ice against the Soviet Union.
Even our diplomatic opening to China
happened in part through sports with
ping-pong diplomacy.
Today, the tables have turned. China
has used sports to export its authori-
tarian model to our soil. So far, it has
found too many willing enforcers in the
NBA. But it doesn’t have to be this
way. Commissioner Adam Silver, after
a slow start, defended Daryl Morey’s
right to speak his mind about Hong
Kong. He said: Free expression is
‘‘what you guys stand for.’’
Too many American companies kow-
tow to China not because they love its
government but because of the tremen-
dous pressure that government can
exert on their operations. But the NBA
is in a unique position. Beijing can ban
an airline, or it can ban a hotel that
lists Taiwan as a country in its online
drop-down menu, and the Chinese peo-
ple can use a different airline, or they
can use a different hotel, but there is
only one NBA. Beijing can’t create an-
other one.
And here is the rub: There are more
than 500 million basketball fans in
China. More people in China follow the
NBA than there are people in the
United States. No doubt Beijing has
some leverage over the NBA, as it does
over all businesses, but the NBA has a
lot of leverage over Beijing. Is Beijing
really going to ban the entire league,
as they have done with the Houston
Rockets, at the risk of alienating more
than 500 million people who follow the
league and the resultant public back-
lash that could create? So instead of
acting as a bullhorn for Communist
propaganda in America, the NBA could
be a beacon of freedom in China. They
could dare China to shut them out.
Let me urge all of these NBA execu-
tives and players who say they care
about social justice, don’t just speak
out when the stakes are low for you
personally or when the cause is popular
among your friends; speak out now
when the stakes are deadly high for
millions of Hongkongers and more than
a billion Chinese, including so many of
your fans.
LeBron James tweeted not long ago:
‘‘Injustice anywhere is a threat to jus-
tice everywhere.’’ Live out that prin-
ciple consistently. There are a million
Uighurs in concentration camps yearn-
ing to hear a champion who speaks out
on their behalf, particularly since the
NBA runs an elite training academy in
proximity to those camps.
Steve Kerr never held back on ex-
pressing his opinion about our Presi-
dent. That is fine. That is his right as
an American. But how about some out-
rage for the authoritarian regime in
Beijing?
Joe Tsai was born in Taiwan. His fel-
low Taiwanese live in constant fear of
meddling, attack, and subjugation by
the Chinese Communist party. Are
they separatists for wanting to main-
tain their way of life? Speak out proud-
ly on behalf of your homeland about
the true nature of the government in
Beijing.
I realize it is a hard thing to ask any
person. No doubt this is a harder path
than the path many in the NBA are
traveling at present. It would require
sacrifice, and it would certainly invite
the wrath of the Chinese Communist
Party. But if the league used its unique
leverage for freedom, millions of ordi-
nary Chinese would surely notice, de-
spite an army of Chinese Communist
censors arrayed against them.
The NBA didn’t pick this fight. It
probably prefers to avoid this fight.
The Chinese Communist Party wants
this fight. So the choice isn’t to fight
or not; it is to win or lose. And perhaps
alone among American businesses, the
NBA has a shot to win against Beijing.
And in any fight against Communists,
there can only be one strategy and one
policy: victory.

S.J. RES. 53
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I
rise in support of the Congressional Re-
view Act resolution of disapproval of
the Trump administration’s so-called
affordable clean energy rule, which
really should be called President
Trump’s dirty power plan or unclean
energy rule.
To be clear, I believe that the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency has an
urgent moral responsibility and eco-
nomic imperative to reduce the global
warming pollution from powerplants,
which are by far the largest stationary
source of carbon pollution on our plan-
et. I also believe that those of us in
Congress must act now to protect the
American people from the dangers
posed by poor environmental quality
and the worsening impact of climate
change. That is why we are holding
this vote tomorrow—to send a clear
message to this administration and to
take a strong stand for the American
people.
Truth be told, I am not typically a
staunch supporter of the Congressional
Review Act. It is a blunt procedural
tool, and I prefer to embrace a better
way to express our disapproval of the
administration’s failure to address one
of our Nation’s major sources of carbon
pollution.
For Senate Democrats, this vote is
about holding supporters of this short-
sighted, irresponsible policy account-
able for surrendering America’s global
leadership and for jeopardizing the
health of our planet and the promise of
our children’s future.
Nearly 4 years ago, the Clean Power
Plan set the first Federal targets to re-
duce carbon emissions from our Na-
tion’s powerplants. The Clean Power
Plan set meaningful but achievable
carbon limits for fossil fuel power-
plants and gave flexibility and time for
States to meet those standards. It was
not a one-size-fits-all deal. It provided
quite a bit of time and flexibility for
States to try to figure out how they
would go about meeting those stand-
ards in their own way. This adminis-
tration’s alternative to the Clean
Power Plan—President Trump’s un-
clean power plan—allows States to de-
cide whether to regulate harmful emis-
sions. At the same time, this rule will,
at best, have essentially no impact on
powerplant carbon emissions—no im-
pact.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5827
October 16, 2019
Let me say that again. At best, this
rule will have essentially no impact on
powerplant carbon emissions. At worst,
it will increase emissions by extending
these plants’ lifespans and allow them
to burn more coal each year.
Today our Nation’s utilities are al-
ready on track to meet and surpass the
emission reduction goals set by the
Clean Power Plan way ahead of sched-
ule. All the while, the vast majority of
Americans are now enjoying lower util-
ity bills, not higher utility bills, and
more than 3 million Americans went to
work today in the clean energy sector,
which includes jobs in renewable en-
ergy generation and energy efficiency.
Yes, you heard that right. There are
more than 3 million jobs in the clean
energy sector today.
The President’s dirty power plan does
not build on this progress. It does not
promote affordable or clean energy.
What it actually does is attempt to
scam or fool the American people into
believing that the EPA is doing some-
thing to stem the tide of climate
change while taking us backward—
backward, not forward.
By repealing and replacing the Clean
Power Plan, the Trump administration
is ensuring that our country forgoes a
vast number of economic opportunities
of the clean energy future. Instead of
building on the Obama-Biden adminis-
tration’s forward-looking environ-
mental standards, the Trump adminis-
tration, with its dirty power plan, is
refusing to see or accept that the glob-
al economy’s transition to clean en-
ergy sources is already underway. In-
stead of mustering the political cour-
age to lead on the issue of climate
change, yet again, the Trump adminis-
tration is walking away from the bold
action we need to address this climate
crisis.
This failure of leadership will make
it all the more likely that the wors-
ening storms and flooding, record-set-
ting rainfall, and volatile temperatures
we are already seeing all over the
world will continue to be our reality.
So where do our Republican col-
leagues stand? Tomorrow we will find
out.
Sadly, for too many of them, Presi-
dent Trump’s dirty power plan is a suf-
ficient plan to address carbon pollu-
tion. In truth, it is not. It is a failure
of vision and a retreat from global
leadership, and it is time for Con-
gress—Democrats, Republicans, and
maybe an Independent or two—to hold
this administration accountable.
That is why Senate Democrats are
calling for a vote on this issue. Our
government needs to provide the right
market signals today if we are going to
create a clean energy tomorrow, and
we need to take a stand for a stronger
economy. We need to lead the world to
act on climate change, and we need to
take a stand for clean air and environ-
mental quality.
We can do that tomorrow by standing
together against President Trump’s
dirty power plan, and I hope a number
of colleagues will join us by doing just
that.
It is a false statement to say we can’t
have cleaner air, less threat to our
planet, and create jobs. We can do
both, and we need to.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska.
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent to complete my
remarks prior to the vote for Ambas-
sador Barrett.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
HYDE-SMITH). Without objection, it is
so ordered.
NOMINATION OF BARBARA MCCONNELL BARRETT
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, a
few weeks ago, I had an opportunity to
come to the floor and talk about the
outstanding public service of some sen-
ior U.S. marines: Secretary of Defense
Jim Mattis, Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity General Kelly, and the outgoing
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Jo-
seph Dunford. The service these gentle-
men have given to their Nation in-
cludes almost 140 years of combined
Active-Duty military service in the
Marine Corps but also at the highest
levels of government at a critical time
in our Nation’s history.
Men and women who are committed
to the service of our Nation are con-
tinuing to follow in the footsteps of
these three very impressive U.S. Ma-
rine generals who brought the Marine
Corps ethos of honor, courage, and
commitment to our Nation’s military
and to their work in government. We
should all be thankful for that.
At the end of September, I had the
privilege of attending the swearing-in
of a member of the new team that
President Trump is putting together in
terms of national security, GEN Mark
Milley, as the next Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, now in the posi-
tion succeeding General Dunford. At
the Department of Defense, we have
Secretary Esper, Secretary McCarthy,
the Secretary of the Army, and Gen-
eral Milley who have all served their
country with honor and will continue
to do so.
Now we are considering the nomina-
tion of Ambassador Barbara Barrett to
be the next Secretary of the Air Force.
In fact, we are going to be voting on
her nomination in a few moments.
I want to talk about her experience
and her qualifications, which are di-
verse and very impressive. I think she
is extremely well qualified to be the
next Secretary of the U.S. Air Force.
Let me provide just a bit about her
background and exceptional experi-
ence. She is a private pilot, astronaut,
Deputy Federal Aviation Adminis-
trator, past CEO of the Aerospace Cor-
poration, past member of the Defense
Advisory Committee on Women in the
Services and Defense Business Board.
Importantly, she is a former U.S. Am-
bassador to Finland. That is a very im-
pressive resume, a very impressive
background.
I first met Ambassador Barrett in
2015 when I had the opportunity to
share dinner with her and the late Sen-
ator John McCain. Prior to that din-
ner, I was talking to Senator John
McCain, and he told me how highly he
thought of Ambassador Barrett. I can
state—and I think many of my Senate
colleagues will agree—that there can
be no better an endorsement than that
from Senator McCain.
Ambassador Barrett will be taking
over from Dr. Heather Wilson, who did
an outstanding job as Secretary of the
Air Force. Secretary Wilson’s leader-
ship was critical in rebuilding the U.S.
Air Force, which had shrunk to its
smallest level ever just a few years ago
since the Air Force was created in the
late 1940s. We had to start bringing it
back. She did a great job on that, and
I know Ambassador Barrett is com-
mitted to continuing that rebuilding of
this critically important branch of our
military.
Another important element of Am-
bassador Barrett’s experience is that as
a former U.S. Ambassador to Finland,
she understands the strategic impor-
tance of the Arctic and what is hap-
pening in terms of great power com-
petition in the Arctic.
I want to spend a few minutes talk-
ing about that critically important
part of the world and the role of my
State, the great State of Alaska. Dat-
ing back to Gen. Billy Mitchell, who is
the father of the U.S. Air Force, Alas-
ka has been recognized as what General
Mitchell said in an Armed Services
Committee hearing; that it is ‘‘the
most strategic place in the world.’’
Former Secretary Wilson and our cur-
rent Chief of the Staff of the Air Force,
General Goldfein, have been leaders at
the Department of Defense, raising
awareness of the critical importance of
the Arctic in defending America’s na-
tional security interests. Additionally,
Congress has been playing a role in
highlighting this in our national secu-
rity priorities in the National Defense
Authorization Act over the last 3 years
and so, too, has the Trump administra-
tion.
Secretary Pompeo, our Secretary of
State, was recently in Finland for the
Arctic Council, all the nations of the
Arctic, and he had this to say:
We are entering a new age of strategic en-
gagement in the Arctic, complete with new
threats to the Arctic and its real estate. . . .
This is America’s moment to stand up as an
Arctic nation and for the Arctic’s future.
That was our Secretary of State a
few months ago in Finland.
America is an Arctic nation because
of Alaska. I like to say that my State
constitutes three pillars of America’s
military might. We are the cornerstone
of missile defense for the entire Na-
tion—the missile fields and the radar
sites that protect Washington, DC, New
York, Miami, Rhode Island, L.A. They
are all based in the great State of Alas-
ka. We are the hub of air combat power
for the Arctic in the Asia-Pacific.
In the next 2 years, we are going to
have over 100 fifth-generation fighters,
F–35s and F–22s, stationed in Alaska.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5828 October 16, 2019
No place on Earth will have that kind
of combat power with those critical
fifth-generation supersonic stealth
fighters. We have a platform for expe-
ditionary forces—some of our best
trained military units—to be able to
deploy on a moment’s notice because
we are so strategically located to other
countries.
Because of Alaska’s strategic role in
defending America’s interests in the
Arctic and the Indo-Pacific, the Con-
gress and this administration, together
in a bipartisan way, have been building
up each of these three critical pillars of
our Nation’s military might and de-
fenses.
Let me give just one example. The
Senate has been pushing lately to en-
sure that the air combat capability we
have in Alaska is matched by air re-
fueling capacity. The last three Na-
tional Defense Authorization Acts
passed by this body and signed by the
President have established criteria
that the Air Force needs to use when
deciding where to base the next modern
aerial refueling tanker platform, the
KC–46.
Ambassador Barrett and I have dis-
cussed this issue and what the Air
Force is going to do with regard to sta-
tioning of the KC–46 outside of the con-
tinental United States, and I look for-
ward to working with her on the advice
already provided to the administration
from the Congress on where those mili-
tary assets need to be based.
As the current Secretary of Defense,
Mark Esper, said in his confirmation
hearing, having KC–46s colocated with
100 fifth-generation fighters would give
America ‘‘extreme strategic reach’’
anywhere in the world. I believe Am-
bassador Barrett also understands this,
and she clearly understands the impor-
tance of the Arctic as a former ambas-
sador to Finland.
So, as I mentioned at the outset, we
need good people and highly qualified
people to serve at the highest levels of
our military, civilian and uniformed,
and I believe Ambassador Barrett is
certainly one of those individuals.
I was heartened to see that my col-
leagues in the Senate gave a very
strong bipartisan cloture vote, 84 to 7,
which shows very strong support for
her nomination. I know we are going to
vote in a couple of minutes. I encour-
age my colleagues to vote yes for her
nomination to be the next U.S. Sec-
retary of the Air Force.
I yield the floor.

S.J. RES. 53
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, with
the election of President Trump in
2016, it was reasonable to believe that
the war on coal was settled, or at least
we had a lasting cease-fire. This ad-
ministration’s policies, supported by
the Congressional Review Act resolu-
tions, undid many of the excesses of
the Obama administration’s regulatory

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5830 October 16, 2019
assault on coal country. Congress and
the President overturned the so-called
stream protection rule, which would
have made it nearly impossible to mine
coal in Appalachia.
The Trump administration has re-
turned sanity to the clean water per-
mitting process in section 404 and is in
the process of restoring the Waters of
the United States rule to align with
congressional intent of protecting Fed-
eral waters and not every stream,
ditch, and gully across this country,
but the jewel of the War on Coal’s
crown was always the Clean Power
Plan.
A sweeping rule to limit the use of
coal in our power generation mix, the
Clean Power Plan ran roughshod over
utility investments and States’ rights
to protect their taxpayers and rate-
payers. In a moment of clarity, then-
Candidate Obama acknowledged that
under his vision for our power system
‘‘electricity rates would necessarily
skyrocket.’’
The Clean Power Plan, if imple-
mented, would have made that vision a
reality. Energy is a topline item in
many of our families’ budgets and very
expensive, and this policy would have
grown these costs significantly. This
plan was so disastrous and so clearly
beyond the scope of EPA’s authority
that 24 States—with West Virginia in
the lead—sued to stop it. The Supreme
Court—our Supreme Court—heard the
call and placed a stay on the rule while
a lower court weighed the merits.
This June, the Trump EPA finalized
its replacement for this unlawful CPP
with the Affordable Clean Energy rule.
This commonsense alternative ac-
knowledges the need to reduce carbon
emissions from our power sector but
ensures that EPA targets are actually
achievable and will not kill jobs in the
utility and energy sectors, nor crush
American families with higher electric
bills.
Fully implemented, the ACE rule
will reduce the CO2 emissions by as
much as 35 percent from 2005 levels.
This administration understands that
protecting our environment need not
come at the expense of a growing econ-
omy. The result has been a growth in
our national GDP that the Obama ad-
ministration’s economic projections
predicted would be unachievable.
The unemployment rate of my own
State of West Virginia is now 4.6 per-
cent, after it had peaked in 2010 at 8.8
percent. This week, many Democrats
in this body want to put all this
progress in jeopardy and reopen the
War on Coal with a Congressional Re-
view Act resolution to block the ACE
rule.
Senate Democrats and their Presi-
dential candidates have doubled down
on policies that would destroy our jobs,
hammer consumers, and burden future
generations with staggering amounts
of debt.
Refusing to learn the lessons of Hil-
lary Clinton’s 2016 failed campaign
promise, which was to put a lot of coal
miners and coal companies out of busi-
ness, the former Vice President has
taken it a step further: pledging on a
Detroit debate stage in July to ‘‘make
sure’’ that coal and natural gas that
comes from fracking are ‘‘eliminated.’’
There is much support on the other
side for the Green New Deal’s energy
and environmental components, which
would cost between $8 trillion and $12
trillion, and that is before adding other
extreme visions for the government
takeover of healthcare, education, and
agriculture.
The Democrats’ energy agenda will
lead to fewer jobs, more expensive util-
ity bills, and less reliable electricity.
We already see the lack of reliability of
our electricity grid in California right
now. I hope the Senate will refuse to go
down this path toward impoverishing
the very people who power the country
and make our quality of life possible.
Passage of this resolution would
serve as the starting point for a re-
sumption of the War on Coal and a
march to the extremist excesses of the
Green New Deal. I urge my colleagues
to heed the voice of the American peo-
ple and vote no on the resolution dis-
approving the ACE rule.
COAL MINERS’ PENSIONS
Mr. President, it is critical that Con-
gress act soon to protect the pensions
of our Nation’s coal miners. The pen-
sion benefits of nearly 100,000 hard-
working people are at risk if Congress
fails to take action to stabilize the
United Mine Workers pension fund.
Over 25,000 current UMWA pension
beneficiaries reside in West Virginia,
making this a critical issue for com-
munities and families across our State.
I have worked in a bipartisan way with
Senator MANCHIN, Senator PORTMAN,
Senator BROWN, and others over the
past several years to support legisla-
tion that stabilizes the mine workers’
pension fund and protects these men
and women and their families.
We are not talking about lavish pen-
sions here. The average beneficiary re-
ceives about $590 per month. Retired
miners from across West Virginia rou-
tinely visit me in my office in DC,
write letters, and talk with me as I
travel the State. I really appreciate
their efforts. We are working hard to
make sure that when they tell me how
critical their pension check is in allow-
ing them to pay for food, medication,
housing, and other essentials, that we
don’t let this critical issue lapse.
These hard-working men and women
deserve the pensions they were prom-
ised, and we should make sure they re-
ceive the benefits they earned by pass-
ing legislation to protect their pen-
sions this year.
CONFIRMATION OF FRANK WILLIAM VOLK
Mr. President, one last issue. The
Senate voted earlier today to confirm
Frank Volk as our U.S. district judge
for the Southern District of West Vir-
ginia. It was unanimous, 92 to 0. Judge
Volk has been serving as the chief
bankruptcy judge in the Southern Dis-
trict since 2015.
Prior to that appointment, he
worked as a career law clerk for some
of our State’s most distinguished ju-
rists, including Judges Charles Haden,
John Copenhaver, Blaine Michael, and
Margaret Workman. Judge Volk is a
graduate of the West Virginia Univer-
sity College of Law, where he served as
editor-in-chief of the Law Review. For
more than a decade, he has taught
courses at the law school on topics
ranging from bankruptcy to Federal
Civil Rights.
I was very pleased that, at my sug-
gestion, President Trump nominated
Judge Volk to continue his service on
the district court, and I am very
pleased about that.
I know he will be a judge who will
root his decisions firmly in the text
and original meaning of our Constitu-
tion and our statutes. I know he will be
fair to all parties who appear before
him. I know he will bring honor to our
Federal judiciary.
Besides all of his legal acumen,
which is tremendous, he is a really de-
cent man. He is a great family man
who loves his family and has remained
very humble through all of his suc-
cesses.
With our actions today, and I thank
my colleagues, the Senate has now con-
firmed 156 judges nominated by Presi-
dent Trump. That number now includes
Judge Volk, as well as Judge Thomas
Kleeh, who is now serving as a district
judge in the Northern District of West
Virginia. It includes 43 judges who now
serve on our courts of appeals, and of
course it includes two Supreme Court
Justices.
It is important that the Senate con-
tinue confirming well-qualified men
and women who will faithfully apply
the law to serve on our Federal courts.
I thank my colleagues again for con-
firming Judge Volk today and hope we
will continue to make judicial con-
firmations a priority as we move for-
ward.

f
BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to
submit to the Senate the budget
scorekeeping report for October 2019.
This is my first scorekeeping report
since I filed the deemed budget resolu-
tion for fiscal year 2020 on September 9,
2019, as required by the Bipartisan
Budget Act of 2019, BBA19. The report
compares current-law levels of spend-
ing and revenues with the amounts
agreed to in BBA19. In the Senate, this
information is used to determine
whether budgetary points of order lie
against pending legislation. The Re-
publican staff of the Budget Committee
and the Congressional Budget Office,
CBO, prepared this report pursuant to
section 308(b) of the Congressional
Budget Act, CBA. The information in-
cluded in this report is current through
October 11, 2019.
Since I filed the deemed budget reso-
lution, only one measure with signifi-
cant budgetary effects has been en-
acted. That measure, the Continuing
Appropriations Act, 2020, and Health
Extenders Act of 2019, PL 116–59, pro-
vided continuing appropriations for
discretionary programs through No-
vember 21, 2019, Division A, and ex-
tended several expiring health pro-
grams, Division B. Division A was
charged to the Senate Appropriations
Committee, while Division B was
charged to the Senate Finance Com-
mittee. As the direct spending and rev-
enue components of the measure were
offset over the 2020 to 2024 and 2020 to
2029 periods, a deficit neutral reserve
fund was used to accommodate the
budgetary effects of this measure pur-
suant to section 3005 of H. Con. Res.
71—115th Congress—the concurrent res-
olution on the budget for fiscal year
2018, as updated by BBA19.
Budget Committee Republican staff
prepared tables A–D.
Table A gives the amount by which
each Senate authorizing committee ex-
ceeds or is below its allocation for
budget authority and outlays under the
fiscal year 2020 deemed budget resolu-
tion. This information is used for en-
forcing committee allocations pursu-
ant to section 302 of the CBA. I am
pleased to report that for this report-
ing period, all authorizing committees
have complied with their allowable
spending limits for each enforceable
period.
Table B provides the amount by
which the Senate Committee on Appro-
priations is below or exceeds the statu-
tory spending limits. This information
is used to determine points of order re-
lated to the spending caps found in sec-
tions 312 and 314 of the CBA. The table
shows that the Appropriations Com-
mittee is also compliant with spending
limits for current the fiscal year.
Those limits for regular discretionary
spending are $666.5 billion for accounts
in the defense category and $621.5 bil-
lion for accounts in the nondefense cat-
egory of spending. As no full-year ap-
propriations measures have been en-
acted for fiscal year 2020, the amounts
shown on the table reflect the budg-
etary authority effects of advanced or
permanent appropriations made avail-
able in prior law.
The 2018 budget resolution contained
points of order limiting the use of
changes in mandatory programs,
CHIMPs, in appropriations bills. Table
C, which tracks the CHIMP limit of $15
billion for 2020, shows the Appropria-
tions Committee has not yet enacted
full-year CHIMPs for this fiscal year.
Table D provides the amount of budg-
et authority enacted for 2020 that has
been designated as either for an emer-
gency or for overseas contingency oper-
ations pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)
of the Balanced Budget and Emergency
Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.
Funding that receives either of these
designations results in cap adjustments
to enforceable discretionary spending
limits. There is no limit on either
emergency or overseas contingency op-
erations spending; however, any Sen-
ator may challenge the designation
with a point of order to strike the des-
ignation on the floor pursuant to cur-
rent budgetary statute.
In addition to the tables provided by
Budget Committee Republican staff, I
am submitting CBO tables, which I will
use to enforce budget totals approved
by Congress.
CBO provided a spending and revenue
report for 2020, which helps enforce ag-
gregate spending levels in budget reso-
lutions under CBA section 311. In its
report, CBO annualizes the temporary
effects of the latest continuing resolu-
tion, which provides funding through
November 21, 2019. For the enforcement
of budgetary aggregates, the Budget
Committee excludes this temporary
funding. As such, the committee views
current-law levels as being $1,181.3 bil-
lion and $668.8 billion below budget res-
olution levels for budget authority and
outlays, respectively. Details on 2020
levels can be found in CBO’s second
table.
Current-law revenues are consistent
with the levels assumed by the budget
resolution.
Social Security levels are consistent
with the budget resolution’s figures for
all enforceable periods.
CBO’s report also provides informa-
tion needed to enforce the Senate pay-
as-you-go—pay-go rule. This rule was
established under section 4106 of the
2018 budget resolution. The Senate pay-
go scorecard shows that there is cur-
rently a zero balance.
This submission also includes a table
tracking the Senate’s budget enforce-
ment activity on the floor since the en-
forcement filing on September 9, 2019.

Hon. MIKE ENZI,
Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Sen-
ate, Washington, DC.
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: The enclosed report

This is CBO’s first current level report for

Sincerely,
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director.

a Sections 1001–1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255) require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services—in particular the Food and Drug Administration and
the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974
(Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include $562 million in budget authority and $854 million in estimated outlays.
b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as unmoved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, amounts in
this current level report do not include those items.
c Section 204 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 requires the Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget to publish the aggregate spending and revenue levels for fiscal year 2020; those aggregate levels were first published in the
Congressional Record on September 9, 2019. The Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget has the authority to revise the budgetary aggregates for the budgetary effects of certain revenue and spending measures pursuant to the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and H. Con. Res. 71 (115th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, as updated by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019:

authority through filing an adjustment in the Congressional Record on Sep-

ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, section
36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act
requires that Congress receive prior no-
tification of certain proposed arms
sales as defined by that statute. Upon
such notification, the Congress has 30
calendar days during which the sale
may be reviewed. The provision stipu-
lates that, in the Senate, the notifica-
tion of proposed sales shall be sent to
the chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
In keeping with the committee’s in-
tention to see that relevant informa-
tion is available to the full Senate, I
ask unanimous consent to have printed
in the RECORD the notifications which
have been received. If the cover letter
references a classified annex, then such
annex is available to all Senators in
the office of the Foreign Relations
Committee, room SD–423.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Pursuant to the
reporting requirements of Section
36(b)(5)(C) of the Arms Export Control
Act (AECA), as amended, we are for-
warding Transmittal No. 19–0J. This re-
port relates to enhancements or up-

120C–7 AMRAAM Guidance Section. Also in-
cluded were one (1) spare AIM–120C–7 control
section, eight (8) AMRAAM Captive Air
Training Missile (CATM–120C), missile con-
tainers, classified software for the AN/MPQ–
64Fl Sentinel Radar, spare and repair parts,
cryptographic and communication security
devices, precision navigation equipment,
other software, site surveys, weapons system
equipment and computer software support,
publications and technical documentation,
common munitions and test equipment, re-
pair and return services and equipment, per-
sonnel training and training equipment, in-
tegration support and test equipment, and
U.S. Government and contractor, engineer-
ing, technical and logistics support services,
and other related elements of logistical and
program support. The estimated total cost
was $215 million. Major Defense Equipment*
(MDE) constituted $95 million of this total.
This proposed sale was in support of Qatar’s
procurement of the National Advanced Sur-
face to Air Missile System (NASAMS) via
Direct Commercial Sale (DCS).
This transmittal reports the inclusion of
up to eighty additional (80) AIM–120C–7 mis-
siles, one hundred twenty (120) AIM–120C–7
ER missiles, thirteen (13) Multifunction In-
formation Distribution System Low Volume
Terminal (MIDS–LVT) Block Upgrade 2, and
associated materiel, support, and services.
These additional MDE items will result in an
increase in MDE cost of $461 million, for a
total MDE value of $556 million. Non-MDE
cost will increase by $16 million. Total case
value will increase to $692 million.
(iv) Significance: This notification is being
provided as these additional missiles rep-
resent an increase in capability over what
was previously notified. This equipment
meets Qatar’s requirements for a NASAMS
capability providing a full range of protec-
tion from imminent hostile cruise missile,
unmanned aerial vehicle, rotary wing, and
fixed wing threats. The MIDS–LVT BU2 will
contribute to the crypto capability of the
NASAMS to enable Qatar’s self-defense capa-
bilities, and enhance its interoperability
with the United States and regional part-
ners.
(v) Justification: This proposed sale sup-
ports the foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives of the United States by help-
ing improve the security of a key partner
that has been, and continues to be, a signifi-
cant host and member of coalition forces in
the Middle East.
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The Sensi-
tivity of Technology Statement contained in
the original notification applies to the AIM–
120C–7 missiles. The AIM–120C–7 ER missiles
have the same capability and sensitivity of
technology as the AIM–120C–7 but with a
larger rocket motor to allow it to travel fur-
ther. The MIDS LVT BU2 is classified CON-
FIDENTIAL and is a secure data and voice
communication network using the Link-16
architecture. The system provides enhanced
situational awareness, positive identifica-
tion of participants within the network, and
secure voice capability. The system provides
the critical ground link for simultaneous co-
ordination of air, land, and maritime forces.

tober 1, 2019.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION
Japan—Follow-On Technical Support (FOTS)
for AEGIS Destroyers
The Government of Japan has requested to
buy Follow-On Technical Support (FOTS)
sustainment and services in support of eight
(8) Japan AEGIS Destroyers consisting of
four (4) KONGO Class Destroyers, two (2)
ATAGO Class Destroyers, two (2) MAYA
Class Destroyers and one (1) Japanese Com-
puter Test Site (JCPTS). The sustainment
efforts will include AEGIS software updates,
system integration and testing, U.S. Govern-
ment and contractor technical assistance,
and other related elements of logistics and
program support. The estimated cost is $140
million.
This proposed sale will support the foreign
policy and national security of the United
States by improving the security of a major
ally that is a force for political stability and
economic progress in the Asia-Pacific region.
It is vital to U.S. national interests to assist
Japan in developing and maintaining a
strong and effective self-defense capability.
The proposed follow-on technical support
is critical to ensure Japan Maritime Self De-
fense Force’s (JMSDF) Aegis Destroyer fleet
and JCPTS remain ready to provide critical
capabilities in the defense of Japan. Japan’s
AEGIS Destroyers provide ship-based bal-
listic missile defense capabilities and build
upon a longstanding cooperative effort with
the United States to provide enhanced capa-
bility with a valued partner in a geographic
region of critical importance to Japan and
the United States. Japan will have no dif-
ficulty absorbing this support into its armed
forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.
The prime contractor will be Lockheed
Martin, Moorestown, NJ. There are no
known offset agreements proposed in connec-
tion with this potential sale.
Implementation of this proposed sale will
require the assignment of two contractor
representatives to Japan to support the pro-
gram.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.

TRANSMITTAL NO. 19–70
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the
Arms Export Control Act
Annex Item No. vii
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
1. The Javelin Weapon System is a me-
dium-range, man portable, shoulder-
launched, fire and forget, anti-tank system
for infantry, scouts, and combat engineers.
The system weighs 49.5 pounds and has a
maximum range in excess of 2,500 meters.
The system is highly lethal against tanks
and other systems with conventional and re-
active armors. The system possesses a sec-
ondary capability against bunkers.
2. Javelin’s key technical feature is the use
of fire-and-forget technology which allows
the gunner to fire and immediately relocate
or take cover. Additional special features are
the top attack and/or direct fire modes, an
advanced tandem warhead and imaging in-
frared seeker, target lock-on before launch,
and soft launch from enclosures or covered
fighting positions. The Javelin missile also
has a minimum smoke motor thus decreas-
ing its detection on the battlefield.
3. The Javelin Weapon System is com-
prised of two major tactical components,
which are a reusable Command Launch Unit
(CLU) and a round contained in a disposable
launch tube assembly. The CLU incorporates
an integrated day-night sight that provides a
target engagement capability in adverse
weather and countermeasure environments.
The CLU may also be used in a stand-alone
mode for battlefield surveillance and target
detection. The CLU’s thermal sight is a sec-
ond generation Forward Looking Infrared
(FLIR) sensor operating in the 8–10 micron
wavelength and has a 240 x 240 pixel scanning
array with a Dewar-coolant unit.
4. The missile is autonomously guided to
the target using an imaging infrared seeker
and adaptive correlation tracking algo-
rithms. This allows the gunner to take cover
or reload and engage another target after fir-
ing a missile. The missile contains an infra-
red seeker with a 64 x 64 pixel element Mer-
cury-Cadmium-Telluride (HgCdTE) Focal
Plane Array (FPA) operating in the 8–10 mi-
cron wavelength. The missile has an ad-
vanced tandem warhead and can be used in
either the top attack or direct fire modes
(for target undercover). An onboard flight
computer guides the missile to the selected
target.
5. The Javelin Missile System hardware
and the documentation are UNCLASSIFIED.
The missile software which resides in the
CLU is considered SENSITIVE. The sensi-
tivity is primarily in the software programs
which instruct the system how to operate in
the presence of countermeasures. The overall
hardware is also considered SENSITIVE in
that the infrared wavelengths could be useful
in attempted countermeasure development.
6. If a technologically advanced adversary
obtains knowledge of the specific hardware
and software elements, the information
could be used to develop countermeasures or
equivalent systems that might reduce weap-
on system effectiveness or be used in the de-
velopment of a system with similar or ad-
vanced capabilities.
7. A determination has been made that
Ukraine can provide substantially the same
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This proposed sale is necessary to fur-
ther the U.S. foreign policy and national se-
curity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification.
8. All defense articles and services listed on
this transmittal are authorized for release
and export to the Government of Ukraine.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO RONNI K. COHEN
∑ Mr. COONS. Mr. President, today I
wish to honor the service and dedica-
tion of a distinguished Delawarean
with a track record of putting service
before herself. She is a thoughtful
friend, not just to me, but to hundreds
of Delawareans up and down the State.
Ronni K. Cohen of Claymont, DE, is a
well-known educator and civic leader
in Delaware and recently retired after
50 years of public service. She taught
thousands of students—children and
adults—financial planning, problem-
solving, entrepreneurship, and so much
more. A Delaware school official once
described Ronni as ‘‘one of the most
dedicated teachers that I have ever
met.’’
In total, Ronni spent 33 years in the
classrooms of Delaware’s Brandywine
School District and in 2000 was recog-
nized as Teacher of the Year by the
Delaware Department of Education.
She was an economics and entrepre-
neurship teacher at elementary schools
like P.S. duPont, Marguerite H. Bur-
nett, and Claymont. During her time
with her third, fourth, and fifth grad-
ers, Ronni instilled in them an indus-
trial spirit and deployed hands-on les-
sons about the crucial role that fi-
nances play in our everyday lives.
Ronni earned many accolades during
her career, including the Delaware
Chamber of Commerce Superstars in
Education Award, the Small Business
Administration Women in Business
Champion Award, the Consortium of
Entrepreneurship Education Leader-
ship and Advocacy Award, the Dela-
ware Library Partnership Award, and a
Freedoms Foundation Leavey Award
for private enterprise education.
In 1992, Ronni and her principal
opened the first bank within a Dela-
ware public school. This innovative
program, in partnership with Wil-
mington Trust, expanded to 20 other
schools across Delaware.
In 2001, when the Delaware Financial
Literacy Institute—DFLI—was born,
Ronni was the obvious choice to lead
it. This not-for-profit organization set
out to promote financial education
through its Delaware Money School
and help individuals gain a better un-
derstanding of the consumer market-
place while providing them with the
necessary instruments to improve their
financial health.
For the next 17 years, Ronni served
as DFLI’s executive director. She
taught classes while recruiting a bat-
talion of volunteer instructors to mul-
tiply the efforts of the Delaware Money
School. Under her leadership, thou-
sands of adult students completed
DFLI coursework and gained the
knowledge they needed to take control
of their financial futures.
Ronni also served on the Governor’s
Task Force for Financial Independence
and the Delaware General Assembly’s
Joint Committee on Financial Lit-
eracy. In 2016, when the State was de-
veloping its financial literacy stand-
ards for K–12, she was hand-picked as
cochairperson of that committee.
From ‘‘EconoM&Mics’’ to ‘‘Purses to
Portfolios’’ and ‘‘Investing for Your
Future,’’ Ronni’s unique classes have
impacted many Delawareans over the
years and made our state stronger and
more prosperous.
‘‘Ronni Cohen is a remarkably effec-
tive educator. She took her prodigious
skills to a different platform by help-
ing tens of thousands of Delawareans
take control of their personal fi-
nances,’’ said former Governor Jack
Markell. ‘‘Ronni is beloved in the Dela-
ware Money School community—and
for a good reason. She gave fully of
herself to improve other peoples’ lives.
Ronni leaves a remarkable legacy of
achievement and contribution. I love
Ronni Cohen!’’
Mr. President, Ronni sees all Dela-
wareans as lifelong students, and she
always ensured that her students and
mentees had the proper tools to build
strong and stable financial futures. Her
legacy is one of a teacher who consist-
ently went to extraordinary lengths to
make sure herlessons made ‘‘cents.’’
Ronni Cohen, from all of your school-
children, your adult learners, your
neighbors, and your state, please ac-
cept our sincere thanks and gratitude.
Thank you for dedicating 50 years to
public service—and on behalf of our en-
tire state, I wish you a happy, fulfilling
retirement. Thank you.∑

HIGH PLAINS HONOR FLIGHT
∑ Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I
stand here today to recognize the vet-
erans of High Plains Honor Flight who
have made their inaugural trip to
Washington, DC. Distinguished vet-
erans from World War II, the Korean
war, and the Vietnam war have made
the journey to visit the national me-
morials dedicated to their service.
Military service is an exceptional
duty to the country. Few words can de-
scribe the gratitude we all share for
sacrifice that these men and women
have made to preserve our rights to
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness. When the United States has been
threatened, our veterans have bravely
answered our countries call without
reservation. Twice a year, the Honor
Flight welcomes veterans from across
the country to fly to Washington, DC,
free of charge, so that they can visit
the national memorials dedicated to
their service.

REMEMBERING HOWARD LUKE
∑ Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I
want to take a few minutes to recog-
nize the life of a highly respected
Athabascan elder Howard Luke, who
died September, 21, 2019 in Fairbanks,
AK, at age 95.
With the passing of Native elder
Howard Luke, Alaska has lost a highly
respected Athabascan leader who dedi-
cated his life to empowering the Alas-
ka Native community and ensuring
that cultural and traditional knowl-
edge will be passed down to younger
generations.
Howard Luke was born in 1923 in
Nenana, later moving to Fairbanks
with his mother at age 13. A man with
a true gentle spirit, Howard made a
unique contribution to our State, and
he shared his passion of the
Athabascan language and traditional
ways.
He always stressed the importance of
school for young people while also
learning their traditions. At his moth-
er’s side, he learned the stories and val-
ues and subsistence way of life of his
people. He sometimes talked about
wishing he had received more formal
schooling and that he felt hindered by
stopping school after the fourth grade;
yet he was constantly pursuing learn-
ing. He travelled to New Zealand, Aus-
tralia, Russia, and visited other Tribes
throughout the United States. In honor
of his efforts, the Fairbanks North Star
Borough School District named an al-
ternative school after him. In 1991, he
received an honorary high school di-
ploma from that school. Howard later
received an honorary doctorate from
the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
In discussing his efforts with schools,
he said that he wanted teachers to help
the kids more than anything else. He
knew that you can’t just tell them,
‘‘This is the way to do it,’’ and leave
them alone. You have got to help them.
His approach was based on the idea
that you have got to make the kids
proud of themselves for what they were
able to do.
Howard made sure to focus on edu-
cating young indigenous people, ‘‘the
grandkids,’’ about the rich culture and
values that are their inheritance.
Howard dedicated his later life to
culture camps and cultural education
in the schools. He started a camp on
the banks of the Chena River, the
Gaaleeya Spirit Camp, to teach skills
to Native youth, such as art, language,
and how to live off the land.
He was a common and welcoming
elder in Canada and the Chilkoot Cul-
ture Camp in Haines. He shared tradi-
tional practices of hunting, teaching
deep respect for those resources that
are so much a part of Alaska Natives
lifestyles.
The knowledge that he had and
shared with others is something you
cannot learn in a university. This
knowledge is passed down from elders
to youth, and he recognized the impor-
tance of sustaining places for younger
generations to learn the ways of their
ancestors.
Howard Luke always said, if you love
the kids, they will know that they are
loved. He also always told the kids to
be proud of themselves. Howard was
loved in return, and Alaskans are im-
mensely proud of all that he contrib-
uted to the State. My deepest condo-
lences to his friends, family, and loved
ones during this time as we reflect on
the life a legendary Alaskan.∑

The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message
from the President of the United
States which was ordered to be printed
in the RECORD, spread in full upon the
Journal, and held at the desk:
To the Senate of the United States:
I am returning herewith without my
approval S.J. Res. 54, a joint resolution
that would terminate the national
emergency I declared in Proclamation
9844 of February 15, 2019, pursuant to
the National Emergencies Act, regard-
ing the ongoing crisis on our southern
border. I am doing so for the same rea-
sons I returned an identical resolution,
H.J. Res. 46, to the House of Represent-
atives without my approval on March
15, 2019.
Proclamation 9844 has helped the
Federal Government address the na-
tional emergency on our southern bor-
der. It has empowered my Administra-
tion’s Government-wide strategy to
counter large-scale unlawful migration
and to respond to corresponding hu-
manitarian challenges through focused
application of every Constitutional and
statutory authority at our disposal. It
has also facilitated the military’s on-
going construction of virtually insur-
mountable physical barriers along hun-
dreds of miles of our southern border.
The southern border, however, con-
tinues to be a major entry point for
criminals, gang members, and illicit
narcotics to come into our country. As
explained in Proclamation 9844, in my
veto message regarding H.J. Res. 46,
and in congressional testimony from
multiple Administration officials, the
ongoing crisis at the southern border
threatens core national security inter-
ests. In addition, security challenges at
the southern border exacerbate an on-
going humanitarian crisis that threat-
ens the well-being of vulnerable popu-
lations, including women and children.
In short, the situation on our south-
ern border remains a national emer-
gency, and our Armed Forces are still
needed to help confront it.
Like H.J. Res. 46, S.J. Res. 54 would
undermine the Government’s ability to
address this continuing national emer-
gency. It would, among other things,
impair the Government’s capacity to
secure the Nation’s southern borders
against unlawful entry and to curb the
trafficking and smuggling that fuels
the present humanitarian crisis.
S.J. Res. 54 is also inconsistent with
other recent congressional actions. For
example, the Congress, in an over-
whelmingly bipartisan manner, has
provided emergency resources to ad-
dress the crisis at the southern border.
Additionally, the Congress has ap-
proved a budget framework that ex-
pressly preserves the emergency au-
thorities my Administration is using
to address the crisis.
Proclamation 9844 was neither a new
nor novel application of executive au-
thority. Rather, it is the sixtieth Presi-
dential invocation of the National
Emergencies Act of 1976. It relies upon
the same statutory authority used by
both of the previous two Presidents to
undertake more than 18 different mili-
tary construction projects from 2001
through 2013. And it has withstood ju-
dicial challenge in the Supreme Court.
Earlier this year, I vetoed H.J. Res.
46 because it was a dangerous resolu-
tion that would undermine United
States sovereignty and threaten the
lives and safety of countless Ameri-
cans. It was, therefore, my duty to re-
turn it to the House of Representatives
without my approval. It is similarly
my duty, in order to protect the safety
and security of our Nation, to return
S.J. Res. 54 to the Senate without my
approval.

S5846 October 16, 2019
Safety Administration to work with
vehicle manufacturers, suppliers, and
other interested parties to advance the
technology developed by the Driver Al-
cohol Detection System for Safety Re-
search Program, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Commerce,
Science, and Transportation.
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the text of the
bill be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the text of
the bill was ordered to be printed in
the RECORD, as follows:
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I rise
today to introduce the Reduce Im-
paired Driving for Everyone Act of 2019
or RIDE Act of 2019. I would like to
thank my co-sponsor, Senator RICK
SCOTT of Florida, who joins me on this
important bill—a bill that will help
end drunk driving and prevent thou-
sands of fatalities and injuries across
the nation.
While we have made progress over
the last several decades to reduce
drunk driving on our roads, it is still a
national tragedy. In 2017, the latest
year for which we have statistics, the
National Highway Traffic Safety Ad-
ministration found that 10,874 person
were killed on American roads by a
drunk driver. That’s one death every 48
minutes. And most tragically: every
single one of those 10,874 deaths could
have been prevented.
Traffic fatalities due to drunk driv-
ing account for one-third of all such fa-
talities. Yet, drunk drivers have only a
two percent chance of being caught.
And one study found that the average
drunk driver has driven drunk 87 times
before being arrested. The RIDE Act
aims to make sure these drivers do not
hit the road in the first place.
I’m not new to this fight. When I was
Attorney General of New Mexico in the
1990’s, our State had one of the highest
DWI rates in the Nation. Then, on
Christmas Eve in 1992, a drunk driver
killed a mother and her three young
daughters as he sped down the highway
the wrong way going 90 miles per hour.
That tragedy galvanized me and many
others in our State. I worked to impose
stronger penalties for repeat offenders,
impose a lower legal limit for intoxica-
tion, and close drive-up liquor win-
dows. Those efforts and the efforts of
many others across New Mexico helped
bring down the number of alcohol-re-
lated fatalities from 460 in 1992 to 131 in
2017. But that’s 131 too many. And so
we have more work to do in New Mex-
ico and across the Nation.
I’ve worked many years to fund de-
velopment of the Driver Alcohol Detec-
tion System for Safety or DADSS tech-
nology—technology that prevents driv-
ers impaired above the legal limit from
ever taking the wheel. When I first
started advocating for this technology,
it seemed far-fetched to some, out of
reach. But, now—it’s being road-tested
and within our grasp.
The RIDE Act builds on the $50 mil-
lion dollars Congress has appropriated
since 2008 by appropriating $5 million
per year toward drunk driver detection
technology during fiscal years 2021 and
2022. The bill will fund the technology
transfer of this software to ready it for
installation and testing in vehicles.
At the same time the Federal govern-
ment has moved to introduce this tech-
nology, some private automobile man-
ufacturers are also developing tech-
nology of their own for installation in
their vehicles. They are to be ap-
plauded.
NHTSA and the Automotive Coali-
tion for Traffic Safety, of which every
major automobile manufacturer is a
member, have engaged in a decade-long
public-private partnership to research,
manufacture, and test equipment to
make vehicles inoperable if alcohol is
present in a person’s breath. They are
engaged now in calibration to ensure
that a vehicle will be inoperable only if
a driver is above the legal limit.
NHTSA and ACTS are working with
the states of Maryland and Virginia to
test this technology. Real world test-
ing is essential—which is why the
RIDE Act will empower the Federal
General Services Administration to in-
corporate anti-drunk driving software
into its fleet on a pilot basis.
Finally, the RIDE Act requires the
NHTSA to promulgate rules to require
installation of advanced drunk driving
prevention technology in all new vehi-
cles not later than two years after en-
actment of the bill. Automobile manu-
facturers will have two model years to
comply with the rule. This means the
RIDE Act sets out about a four year
window to prevent drunk driving in all
new vehicles. This tremendous goal is
within reach.
Again, I appreciate the support of my
colleague, Senator SCOTT. The RIDE
Act should have strong bipartisan sup-
port. Drunk drivers don’t discriminate
on the basis of political party. I urge

By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself
and Mr. GRAHAM):
S. 2612. A bill for the relief of Maria
Isabel Bueso Barrera, Alberto Bueso
Mendoza, and Karla Maria Barrera De
Bueso; to the Committee on the Judici-
ary.
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President,
today I am introducing a bill with Sen-
ate Judiciary Chairman LINDSAY GRA-
HAM for the private relief of Maria Isa-
bel Bueso Barrera and her parents. Ms.
Bueso is a Guatemalan national living
in Concord, California. She has a rare
medical condition and her removal
from the United States would deprive
her of lifesaving medical care.
Ms. Bueso suffers from a rare, life-
threatening disorder called
Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VI (MPS–
VI)—a rare genetic condition caused by
the absence of an enzyme that is need-
ed for the growth of healthy bones and
connective tissues. Ms. Bueso uses a
wheelchair for mobility, has a shunt in
her brain, and requires a tracheotomy
to help her breathe.
In 2003, Ms. Bueso and her family
came to the United States at the invi-
tation of doctors who were conducting
a clinical trial to treat her condition.
That trial led to Food and Drug Ad-
ministration approved treatment for
MPS–VI. Ms. Bueso now receives this
life-saving treatment every week at
UCSF Children’s Hospital in Oakland,
CA, where she undergoes a 6-hour infu-
sion of a prescription drug that re-
places the enzyme that people with
MPS–VI lack. Ms. Bueso has partici-
pated in six other medical trials.
For the past 10 years, Isabel and her
family received deferred action from
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Serv-
ices so that she could continue receiv-
ing the treatments that keep her alive.
This treatment is not available in Gua-
temala.
On August 13, 2019, USCIS notified
Ms. Bueso and her family that their ex-
tensions of deferred action were denied,
and that they would be deported if they
did not leave the United States within
33 days. This decision was effectively a
death sentence for Ms. Bueso. On Sep-
tember 3, 2019, USCIS announced that
they would reconsider her case, but a
final decision has not been made.
Ms. Bueso has beaten the odds be-
cause of the life-saving treatment that
she has received in the United States.
She is now 24 years old, and a 2018 grad-
uate of California State University,
East Bay. She has become an out-
spoken advocate on behalf of people
with rare diseases. Her family pays
taxes, owns a home, and is active in
their community.
The Bueso family should be allowed
to remain in California, where they
will continue to enrich their commu-
nity, and where Isabel will be able to
receive the care that allows her to sur-
vive and thrive.
The legislation that Chairman GRA-
HAM and I are introducing today would
provide a permanent solution for Isabel
and her parents. I ask my colleagues to
support this private bill, which makes
the Bueso family eligible for issuance
of an immigrant visa or for adjustment
of status.
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the text of
the bill be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the text of
the bill was ordered to be printed in
the RECORD, as follows:
S. 2612
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR
MARIA ISABEL BUESO BARRERA,
ALBERTO BUESO MENDOZA, AND

By Mr. SASSE:
S.J. Res. 58. A joint resolution ex-
pressing support for freedom of con-
science; read the first time.
Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I come to
the floor today to ask each and every
Member of Congress to answer this
simple question: Is it right for the U.S.
Federal Government to get into the
business of policing Muslims’, Jews’,
and Christians’ religious beliefs, about
whether or not they are acceptable? Is
it the business of the Federal Govern-
ment of the United States to determine
true and false religion?
Last week, a former Member of Con-
gress now running for President, didn’t
blink an eye when he announced that
he would strip religious institutions,
colleges, churches, and other not-for-
profit service organizations of their
tax-exempt status if they don’t agree
with his political positions.
That is a pretty major departure
from what America is and what we usu-
ally talk about in this body. So we
should pause, and we should call that
what it is. That is extreme intolerance,
it is extreme bigotry, and it is pro-
foundly un-American.
The whole point of America is the
First Amendment, and the whole point
of the First Amendment is that, no
matter who you love and no matter
how you worship, we believe in Amer-
ica that everyone—everyone—is cre-
ated with dignity. This is a funda-
mental American tenet. It is why this
country was founded.
Because we are all created with dig-
nity, none of us has the right to dictate
the conscience commitments of other
people. The freedom of conscience is a
fundamental American belief, and,
thankfully, politicians have no busi-
ness policing that.
At the end of the day, there are real-
ly just two kinds of societies. There are
societies that are about force and
power, and there are societies that are
about persuasion, about assembly, and
about love.
For more than 230 years, we have de-
cided in this country that we are the
latter. We are a community of persua-
sion, not primarily a community of
power and force.
In America, we don’t think the cen-
ter of life is defined by government. We
think the frame of life is defined by
government.
Abraham Lincoln often, sort of apoc-
ryphally summarizing George Wash-
ington, used to talk about the silver
frame and the golden apple. In Amer-
ica, the government is just the silver

frame. It is the structure that defines
the framework for the order of liberty
so that the golden apple—the good, the
true, and the beautiful, the things that
you love and that you want to build—
you go do by persuading people to join
with you in a cause. Government
doesn’t define the center.
Washington, DC, is not the center of
American life. Washington, DC, is sup-
posed to be a servant community that
exists to maintain a framework for the
order of liberty and guards us against
enemies, foreign and domestic, so that
your household and your neighborhood
and your place of worship can be the
center of life.
We are not Chinese Communists who
take Uighurs and throw them into
camps. We are not Russian oligarchs
who tell journalists what they can and
can’t write. We are not Venezuelan
strongmen who beat the hell out of
protesters. We are Americans. And in
America, we disagree about many
things. We disagree profoundly and vig-
orously, but then we come together
and create a system where we work out
our differences not with fists but with
words. We work out our differences
with civility and tolerance and respect
and persuasion.
All of this starts with the First
Amendment. The five freedoms of the
First Amendment—religion, speech,
press, assembly, and protest—define
who we are as a people and what we be-
lieve in common. And guess what. You
can’t separate these five. These five
freedoms are all in the same amend-
ment for a reason—because if one of
them falls, they all fall. They stand or
fall together, and you are a hypocrite if
you pat yourself on the back for de-
fending one of these five freedoms and
then the next day, when another one is
unpopular, say: Well, we don’t need
that one; we can throw it overboard.
The five freedoms are interconnected
and are interdependent, and they are
all in that same amendment, the First
Amendment, for a reason.
These are the rights of conscience
that belong together, and they cannot
be taken or policed by government.
That means that if a Texas politician
pandering for a sound bite decides to
make a boldfaced threat against Mus-
lims and Jews and Christians—all
Americans from every faith and every
walk of life—we have an obligation to
come together and defend our free-
doms, so we should do that.
That is what I am on the floor here
today to do. I am introducing a simple
resolution today that will give every
Member of the Congress—the House
and Senate—the opportunity to tell
our constituents whether we still be-
lieve in the First Amendment. It is an
opportunity to show the American peo-
ple that bigotry against religion in the
name of partisan politics is not per-
mitted in our system of government.
This isn’t a Republican or a Demo-
cratic premise; this is an American
idea, that we condemn politicians who
say they are going to police other peo-
ple’s religious beliefs. Congress doesn’t
target or punish organizations that are
exercising constitutionally protected
rights.
This really shouldn’t be complicated.
Government doesn’t rifle through your
pastor’s or your rabbi’s sermon notes.
Government doesn’t tell your clerics
what they can or can’t say. Govern-
ment doesn’t tell your religious leaders
how they will perform their services.
Government doesn’t tell you where or
when you will worship. Government
doesn’t teach our kids how they are to
pray. Government doesn’t lecture you
on Heaven and Hell. Government’s job
is not to define true and false religion.
That is something much closer to the
center of the frame, the golden apple.
The silver frame is the humble job we
have to do in public life, which is to
maintain a framework for ordered lib-
erty so that Americans, in their neigh-
borhoods and over dinner tables, can
try to persuade each other how to wor-
ship and what to believe by arguments,
not by fists and not by the police.
Government doesn’t get to do any of
that in this country because we recog-
nize that government is not God.
Americans reject the divine right of
Kings, and we reject the infallibility of
politics.
Government doesn’t try to make an
example of your church or your syna-
gogue or your mosque because some
politician decided your views were out
of favor. Your religious organization
doesn’t get taxed differently because a
politician running for office decides to
disagree with one of your beliefs. What-
ever faith you are from in America,
whatever party you are in, we believe
in America that all 225 million of us
are created equal, and we believe that
whether your faith is traditional or
progressive, it is yours, and it is be-
tween you and your religious commu-
nity and your God. It is not the domain
of politicians.
Government can’t force you out of
the public square because of the faith
you hold—at least that is what we have
always believed in the past. It is what
we believed for more than 200 years. We
are not perfect, of course. We have fall-
en short of that idealism time and
again. That doesn’t mean the ideas of
the American founding in the First
Amendment are wrong; it means that
our ideals need to be strived for yet
again and reaffirmed.
I want to give every Member of Con-
gress the opportunity in the coming
weeks to do just that. The resolution I
am introducing today ought to get a
vote so House and Senate Members can
be on record for our constituents about
whether we affirm the First Amend-
ment and in particular the free exer-
cise of religion and the free assembly
clause. I am going to read it for every-
one’s benefit. It is pretty short. This is
the resolution being submitted:
Whereas the settlement of the 13 colonies
was driven in part by those seeking refuge
from government-sponsored religious perse-
cution;
Whereas the Framers of the Constitution
of the United States recognized the cen-
trality of freedom of conscience to the estab-
lishment of the United States, enshrining in
the First Amendment to the Constitution of
the United States that ‘‘Congress shall make
no law respecting an establishment of reli-
gion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;
or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the
press, or the right of the people peaceably to
assemble, and to petition the Government
for a redress of grievances’’;
Whereas churches, synagogues, mosques,
and other religious organizations have
played a central and invaluable role in life in
the United States; and
Whereas Congress has recognized the im-
portance of religious institutions by enact-
ing a variety of legal protections for those
institutions, including exemption from in-
come taxes: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate and the House of
Representatives of the United States of
America in Congress assembled, That—
(1) the protections of freedom of conscience
enshrined in the First Amendment to the
Constitution of the United States remain
central to the experiment of the United
States in republican self-government under
the Constitution of the United States;
(2) government should not be in the busi-
ness of dictating what ‘‘correct’’ religious
beliefs are; and
(3) any effort by the government to condi-
tion the receipt of the protections of the
Constitution of the United States and the
laws of the United States, including an ex-
emption from taxation, on the public policy
positions of an organization is an affront to
the spirit and letter of the First Amendment
to the Constitution of the United States.
I don’t care what some nitwit said on
CNN last week to satisfy his fringy
base and try to get a sound bite in a
Presidential debate. The American peo-
ple ought to know that this body
stands for the historic First Amend-
ment. That is what we all took an oath
to uphold and to defend, and that is
what we ought to vote to affirm again.
Let’s do it.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS
SENATE RESOLUTION 358—DESIG-
NATING THE WEEK BEGINNING
OCTOBER 20, 2019, AS ‘‘NATIONAL
CHARACTER COUNTS WEEK’’
Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Ms.
STABENOW, Mr. ENZI, Mr. ALEXANDER,
Mr. LANKFORD, and Ms. WARREN) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which
was considered and agreed to:
S. RES. 358
Whereas the well-being of the United
States requires that the young people of the
United States become an involved, caring
citizenry of good character;
Whereas the character education of chil-
dren has become more urgent, as violence by
and against youth increasingly threatens the
physical and psychological well-being of the
people of the United States;
Whereas, more than ever, children need
strong and constructive guidance from their
families and their communities, including
schools, youth organizations, religious insti-
tutions, and civic groups;
Whereas the character of a nation is only
as strong as the character of its individual
citizens;
Whereas the public good is advanced when
young people are taught the importance of
good character and the positive effects that
good character can have in personal relation-
ships, in school, and in the workplace;
Whereas scholars and educators agree that
people do not automatically develop good
character and that, therefore, conscientious
efforts must be made by institutions and in-
dividuals that influence youth to help young
people develop the essential traits and char-
acteristics that comprise good character;
Whereas, although character development
is, first and foremost, an obligation of fami-
lies, the efforts of faith communities,
schools, and youth, civic, and human service
organizations also play an important role in
fostering and promoting good character;
Whereas Congress encourages students,
teachers, parents, youth, and community
leaders to recognize the importance of char-
acter education in preparing young people to
play a role in determining the future of the
United States;
Whereas effective character education is
based on core ethical values, which form the
foundation of a democratic society;
Whereas examples of character are trust-
worthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness,
caring, citizenship, and honesty;
Whereas elements of character transcend
cultural, religious, and socioeconomic dif-
ferences;
Whereas the character and conduct of
youth reflect the character and conduct of
society, and, therefore, every adult has the
responsibility to teach and model ethical
values and every social institution has the
responsibility to promote the development of
good character;
Whereas Congress encourages individuals
and organizations, especially those that have
an interest in the education and training of
the young people of the United States, to
adopt the elements of character as intrinsic
to the well-being of individuals, commu-
nities, and society;
Whereas many schools in the United States
recognize the need, and have taken steps, to
integrate the values of their communities
into teaching activities; and
Whereas the establishment of ‘‘National
Character Counts Week’’, during which indi-
viduals, families, schools, youth organiza-
tions, religious institutions, civic groups,
and other organizations focus on character
education, is of great benefit to the United
States: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) designates the week beginning October
20, 2019, as ‘‘National Character Counts
Week’’; and
(2) calls upon the people of the United
States and interested groups—
(A) to embrace the elements of character
identified by local schools and communities,
such as trustworthiness, respect, responsi-
bility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; and
(B) to observe the week with appropriate
ceremonies, programs, and activities.

RELATING TO A NATIONAL EMER-
GENCY DECLARED BY THE
PRESIDENT ON FEBRUARY 15,
2019—VETO
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, is
the veto message with respect to S.J.
Res. 54 at the desk?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous
consent that the veto message on S.J.
Res. 54 be considered as having been
read, that it be printed in the RECORD,
and spread in full upon the Journal.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
The veto message is ordered to be
printed in the RECORD as follows:
To the Senate of the United States:
I am returning herewith without my
approval S.J. Res. 54, a joint resolution
that would terminate the national
emergency I declared in Proclamation
9844 of February 15, 2019, pursuant to
the National Emergencies Act, regard-
ing the ongoing crisis on our southern
border. I am doing so for the same rea-
sons I returned an identical resolution,
H.J. Res. 46, to the House of Represent-
atives without my approval on March
15, 2019.
Proclamation 9844 has helped the
Federal Government address the na-
tional emergency on our southern bor-
der. It has empowered my Administra-
tion’s Government-wide strategy to
counter large-scale unlawful migration
and to respond to corresponding hu-
manitarian challenges through focused
application of every Constitutional and
statutory authority at our disposal. It
has also facilitated the military’s on-
going construction of virtually insur-
mountable physical barriers along hun-
dreds of miles of our southern border.
The southern border, however, con-
tinues to be a major entry point for
criminals, gang members, and illicit
narcotics to come into our country. As
explained in Proclamation 9844, in my
veto message regarding H.J. Res. 46,
and in congressional testimony from
multiple Administration officials, the
ongoing crisis at the southern border
threatens core national security inter-
ests. In addition, security challenges at
the southern border exacerbate an on-
going humanitarian crisis that threat-
ens the well-being of vulnerable popu-
lations, including women and children.
In short, the situation on our south-
ern border remains a national emer-
gency, and our Armed Forces are still
needed to help confront it.
Like H.J. Res. 46, S.J. Res. 54 would
undermine the Government’s ability to
address this continuing national emer-
gency. It would, among other things,
impair the Government’s capacity to
secure the Nation’s southern borders
against unlawful entry and to curb the
trafficking and smuggling that fuels
the present humanitarian crisis.
S.J. Res. 54 is also inconsistent with
other recent congressional actions. For
example, the Congress, in an over-
whelmingly bipartisan manner, has
provided emergency resources to ad-
dress the crisis at the southern border.
Additionally, the Congress has ap-
proved a budget framework that ex-
pressly preserves the emergency au-
thorities my Administration is using
to address the crisis.
Proclamation 9844 was neither a new
nor novel application of executive au-
thority. Rather, it is the sixtieth Presi-
dential invocation of the National
Emergencies Act of 1976. It relies upon
the same statutory authority used by
both of the previous two Presidents to

turn it to the House of Representatives

f
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I rise
today to speak about the impeachment
inquiry currently under way in the
House of Representatives. The House
impeachment inquiry is a solemn and
serious matter. It concerns the official
conduct of the President of the United
States, and it implicates matters of
grave importance: our national secu-
rity, the rule of law, and the very foun-
dations of our Constitution.
We all—Democrats and Republicans
alike—have a duty to defend our de-
mocracy, so when we are confronted
with evidence that President Donald
Trump abused his power and violated
his oath of office by seeking foreign in-
terference in our elections and then
sought to cover it up, we have a con-
stitutional obligation to investigate.
The evidence we have already seen
validates Speaker PELOSI’s decision to
open an impeachment inquiry and rein-
forces the need for this inquiry to con-
tinue unimpeded. Indeed, Donald
Trump himself has already confirmed
key evidence.
Just look at what we know so far. We
know that Donald Trump asked a for-
eign power, Ukraine, to investigate his
political opponent. The President both
admitted it on live television and then
released a transcript showing that it
had happened just as a whistleblower
alleged that it did. That is not in dis-
pute.
We also know that Donald Trump
then doubled down, subsequently ad-
mitting on camera that he wants for-
eign governments like Ukraine and
China to investigate his political oppo-
nents. That is not in dispute.
So instead of focusing on the Latin
phrase ‘‘quid pro quo,’’ the President
should be saying, ‘‘mea culpa’’—my
fault, but he is not. And with each
passing day, additional evidence of se-
rious wrongdoing at the highest levels
of our government has surfaced, evi-
dence that Donald Trump has sub-
jugated the Nation’s interest to his
personal and political interest and evi-
dence that plainly warrants further in-
vestigation.
For example, we learned that prior to
his phone call with Ukrainian Presi-
dent Zelensky, Donald Trump blocked
almost $400 million in military and se-
curity aid to Ukraine. Moreover, as the
White House’s own partial transcript of
the conversation reflects, Donald
Trump conditioned this aid on the
Ukrainian President’s willingness to
conduct a political investigation, tell-
ing him: ‘‘I would like you to do this as
a favor though.’’
Donald Trump’s quid pro quo linking
U.S. military and security aid to a po-
litically motivated investigation
makes his admitted solicitation of for-
eign interference in our elections that
much worse. It is an abuse of power and
betrayal of Trump’s oath to the Con-
stitution and promise to the American
people.
We have also learned that White
House officials moved the transcript of
the phone call between President
Trump and President Zelensky from its
typical electronic storage system to a
separate system intended to handle
classified information of an especially
sensitive nature. In other words, there
appears to have been an effort to cover
up Donald Trump’s wrongdoing.
We are also witnessing extraordinary
attacks by Donald Trump on the whis-
tleblower who brought the matter to
light.
Donald Trump’s attacks on this indi-
vidual are so serious and so harmful
that they may rise to the level of wit-
ness tampering and obstruction of jus-
tice. They send a chilling message to
others who may have information and
are contemplating coming forward.
It should go without saying that
whistleblowers play an important role

S5854 October 16, 2019
in our democracy, especially when it
comes to whistleblowers in the intel-
ligence community. They should be
praised and not demonized or threat-
ened.
Most recently, we have learned that
the President allowed his personal at-
torney, Rudy Giuliani, to conduct a
shadow foreign policy outside of proper
State Department channels—a foreign
policy that serves personal interests
and the President’s personal political
interests, but not the interests of the
United States or the American people.
We have learned that two individuals
connected to Giuliani have been in-
dicted on charges of violating Federal
campaign finance laws stemming from
hidden foreign campaign donations. We
have learned that a career diplomat
with an unblemished record was re-
called from Ukraine because she hon-
ored her oath to the Constitution, but
Trump viewed her as an impediment to
his foreign policy agenda.
These are just some of the things we
have learned in the past few days.
So what must we do? The answer is
simple. We must investigate and get all
the facts, Donald Trump’s unprece-
dented and unjustified refusal to co-
operate notwithstanding. The torrent
of revelations of serious misconduct re-
lating to foreign interference in our
elections only underscores the need for
the House investigation to continue
unimpeded.
The Founding Fathers were very con-
cerned about foreign interference in
America’s democracy. They knew that
foreign involvement in our politics and
elections posed a threat to our sov-
ereignty as a new nation.
In 1787, John Adams wrote: ‘‘As often
as elections happen, the danger of for-
eign influence recurs.’’ In 1788, Alex-
ander Hamilton warned us that foreign
powers trying to gain influence in our
politics would be ‘‘the most deadly ad-
versaries of Republican government.’’
The threat of foreign interference in
our elections is as serious today as it
was more than 200 years ago. We must
do all that we can to defend against it,
and that includes an impeachment in-
quiry into the conduct of the President
when he admits to soliciting that very
interference.
The House of Representatives is
going to begin a process. If the House
of Representatives ultimately approves
articles of impeachment against Don-
ald Trump, the Senate will hold a trial
and our Members will serve as jurors.
As a member of the Senate and a po-
tential juror, I will take my job as seri-
ously as any I have ever had in this in-
stitution, and I hope my Republican
colleagues will do so as well. The
American people deserve nothing less.
Leader MCCONNELL and my Repub-
lican colleagues must uphold their
oaths to the Constitution, put country
over party, and conduct a fair trial.
Anything short of that would be a dere-
liction of duty.
No one should prejudge the case. In-
deed, that is precisely the advice that
Leader MCCONNELL gave during the
1998 impeachment proceedings when he
stated: ‘‘As a potential juror, if it’s se-
rious enough to warrant a potential
impeachment proceeding, I don’t think
I ought to prejudge the case.’’
We have a constitutional duty to in-
vestigate President Trump’s attempts
to orchestrate foreign interference in
our elections, the usage of his office to
support his personal political goals,
and how he sought to cover up that ef-
fort. Nothing less than our national se-
curity, the rule of law, and our con-
stitutional order are at stake.
I yield the floor.

HONORING THE AMERICAN ASSO-
CIATION OF COLLEGES OF NURS-
ING
HON. LAUREN UNDERWOOD
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I
stand today to recognize the American Asso-
ciation of Colleges of Nursing (AACN)—the
national voice for academic nursing—as this
organization celebrates 50 years of advancing
excellence in baccalaureate and graduate
nursing education, promoting nursing re-
search, and improving the health of our nation.
Since 1969, AACN has set the standards for
educating the nation’s largest healthcare pro-
fession, nursing. AACN has consistently illus-
trated a steadfast commitment to nursing
schools, deans, faculty, and students who are
essential to ensuring a strong nursing work-
force able to support the health and well-being
of citizens in all communities throughout the
country.
The rich history of AACN began with a mod-
est but significant meeting of 44 deans of
nursing who met in Detroit, Michigan in 1969
and formed the Conference of Deans of Col-
leges and University Schools of Nursing. At its
inception, the organization—soon to be re-
named the American Association of Colleges
of Nursing—represented 121 member institu-
tions. This organization had a number of vi-
sionary leaders, not only for higher education,
but also for the nursing profession. AACN has
provided guidance through changing social,
political, and economic context and as our
country weathered many changes and ad-
vancements in health care and higher edu-
cation.
Over the last 50 years, AACN’s dedication
to sustaining the nation’s nursing workforce
has expanded and evolved with the organiza-
tion now comprised of more than 825 schools
of nursing representing more than 45,000 fac-
ulty members and 543,000 students. AACN’s
commitment to preparing nurses with the skills
needed to transform health care and improve
the public’s health has had a profound impact
in every state and has helped to support the
nation’s healthcare infrastructure.
As the American Association of Colleges of
Nursing celebrates its 50th Anniversary, I
commend AACN for its leadership in edu-
cating the nursing workforce; its commitment
to advancing innovation, diversity, inclusion,
and research in the nursing profession; and
for its dedication to driving excellence in aca-
demic nursing.
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF DR.
JOHNNIE M. ARMSTRONG
HON. TRENT KELLY
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to celebrate the life of Dr. Johnnie
M. Armstrong, who passed away on Monday,
September 30th.
Johnnie, a native of Nashville, Tennessee,
was a long-time faculty member at Blue Moun-
tain College in Blue Mountain, Mississippi.
During her 64-year career at Blue Mountain
College, she had many roles in the college’s
health and physical education, including Ath-
letic Director for the college. Her influence in
the athletic program led Blue Mountain Col-
lege to dedicate both their Campus Fitness
Center and the Tyler Gymnasium floor to
Johnnie. Johnnie also served as Special Am-
bassador of Blue Mountain College, where
she represented the entire college.
Johnnie’s love for fitness education ex-
panded beyond Blue Mountain College and
led her to receive many accolades from var-
ious organizations. Johnnie was named ‘‘Fe-
male Athletics Administrator of the Year for
District 24,’’ and the ‘‘NAIA Athletic Adminis-
trator of the Year.’’ She received the ‘‘Price in
Teaching Award’’ from the Mississippi Asso-
ciation for Health, Physical Education, Recre-
ation and Dance (MAHPERD), the ‘‘Pathfinder
Award’’ from the National Association for Girls
and Women in Sports, Blue Mountain Col-
lege’s Outstanding Faculty Member Award in
both 1979 and 2000 and the Higher Education
Appreciation Day Working for Academic Excel-
lence (HEADWAE) Award in both 1988 and
1997.
Left to cherish her memory are many ex-
tended family members, friends, her congrega-
tion at Lowrey Memorial Baptist Church in
Blue Mountain, MS, as well as the faculty and
students at Blue Mountain College.
Johnnie’s life was one of service, grace, and
love for her community. She will be greatly
missed by all who she encountered.

SARY OF THE GREENING OF DE-

HON. RASHIDA TLAIB
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the Greening of Detroit, an organi-
zation dedicated to creating a greener and
more sustainable Detroit.
Greening of Detroit was founded in 1989
with the primary goal of restoring Detroit’s
once lush tree-lined neighborhoods and parks.
Since then, the organization’s mission has ex-
panded to include working toward green infra-
structure, protecting our natural resources,
and environmental sustainability. These efforts
have not only concentrated on the City’s envi-
ronmental needs, but also on created ‘‘green
jobs’’ by recruiting and training local individ-
uals in urban forestry and landscaping. Green-
ing of Detroit has continued to foster passion
about creating a sustainable future for Detroit
through its youth education and summer jobs
programs. In short, Greening of Detroit is an
organization that has adapted to the needs of
the community it serves and has grown re-
markably as one of Detroit’s premier environ-
mental stewards.
I therefore ask you to please join me in trib-
ute to Greening of Detroit as they celebrate
thirty years of service.

HON. GREG PENCE
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
give my deepest sympathies to the Welch
Family and the City of Madison.
On Wednesday September 25, Mayor
Damon Welch of Madison, Indiana passed
away. Mayor Welch was a devoted public
servant who cared deeply about his family, his
country, and his community.
Mayor Welch married Virginia ‘‘Ginny’’
Kelley in 1973. He graduated from the Univer-
sity of Kentucky with a degree in Business Ad-
ministration and was a cadet in the ROTC pro-
gram. Mayor Welch joined the United States
Air Force in 1975 and served five years in the
United States Air Force, earning the rank of
Captain and meriting the Air Force Longevity
Service Ribbon.
After his service, Mayor Welch returned to
his hometown of Madison where he ran a
small business and worked in the health care
industry.
Mayor Welch was elected as the Mayor of
Madison in 2012 and was finishing his second
term in office.
Mayor Welch was a devoted servant to the
people of Madison, and he will be dearly
missed by all.
I give my deepest condolences to his wife
Ginny, daughters Gaeli and Kirsty, son Collin,
and the entire community of Madison.

the Petosa brothers: Mario Sr., Joseph, Mi-
chael, and Angelo.
Mario Sr. served in the U.S. Army from
1942 to 1947, fighting in the Pacific theater
during World War II from the Aleutian Islands
in Alaska to Okinawa in Japan. Mario received
numerous decorations for his service including
two Purple Hearts and six Bronze Battle Stars.
Joseph served in the U.S. Navy from 1943 to
1946, reaching the rank of Metalsmith Third
Class and receiving the Asiatic Pacific Theatre
Ribbon and 4 Bronze Battle Stars. Michael
served in the U.S. Army from 1942 to 1946
and was awarded the American Service Medal
for his actions during the occupation of Japan.
Angelo’s service in the U.S. Navy began after
World War II and he remained in the U.S.
Navy from 1952 to 1972, eventually achieving
the rank of Lieutenant.
These brothers represent the best among
us: a family dedicated to this country. They
served America, fighting for our freedom dur-
ing World War II and during the Cold War.
With every day that passes, it becomes more
and more important that we all work to recog-
nize their accomplishments and preserve their
stories for future generations. Our children and
our children’s children must know the sac-
rifices they made so many years ago so that
we may be free today.
The Petosa brothers are proof not just of
the greatness of our community on Staten Is-
land, but of the entire country. They came
here as immigrants from Italy, making tremen-
dous sacrifices not just to call this country
home, but to put their lives on the line to de-
fend it. This is a testament not only to the
character of these men, but to the country
they chose to live in and serve. That spirit
lives on in the United States military today, in
men and women like the ones I served with in
Afghanistan who were willing to risk it all first
to become an American, and then to protect
that right for others.
So Madam Speaker, during this Italian-
American Heritage Month, I ask my colleagues
in the House to join me in recognizing Mario
Sr., Joseph, Michael, and Angelo Petosa, four
Italian-American heroes who dedicated their
lives to serving to this country and who rep-
resent the best of Staten Island.

IN RECOGNITION OF SCHROEDER’S
FLOWERS 120 YEARS OF SUCCESS
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the 120th anniversary of
Schroeder’s Flowers.
This family-owned flower shop began in
1899 when award-winning florist Carl Meier
immigrated from Germany to Green Bay and
opened his own flower shop. A few years after
opening, Carl asked Otto Schroeder to leave
Germany and help him grow his business.
Schroeder stayed in Green Bay and later mar-
ried Carl’s daughter, Clara, and the business
was renamed Schroeder’s Flowers.
Schroeder’s Flowers has always been a
family business. In 1949, Otto’s son, Otto Jr.,
took over the business and moved the location
of the shop to Webster Avenue in Allouez.
Today the business is run by fourth and fifth
generation owners, Charles and Peggy
Schroeder and their son, Brian.
Schroder’s Flowers remains a pillar of the
Green Bay community. Its prioritization of cus-
tomer service has created a loyal customer
base that depends on Schroeder’s for its floral
design expertise. Through the years, Schroe-
der’s Flowers has fostered a strong relation-
ship with its customers, who have showed
continuous support for the family and their
business. From a small shop that used to de-
liver flowers by horse and wagon, to one that
has adapted to the changing economy and
now processes orders online, Schroeder’s
Flowers continues to evolve and provide cus-
tomers with quality service and beautiful floral
arrangements.
Family-run small businesses are the back-
bone of the American economy. I am proud to
have such a flourishing business in my district
that puts the needs of the community and its
customers first. It is encouraging to see a local
business succeed across two centuries, and to
continue to uphold the values of Northeast
Wisconsin. Family’s like the Schroeders are
what make our district great, and I am proud
to represent them.
Madam speaker, it is my honor to congratu-
late Schroeder’s Flowers on 120 strong years
in business. I wish the Schroeder family many
more years of continued success.

graduate of the 139th FBI National Academy,
Director Vittum has not only helped keep our
communities safe but he has also shared his
expertise with the next generation of aspiring
community servants by serving as an adjunct
professor of criminal justice.
Law enforcement today looks very different
than when Director Vittum began his career.
But Director Vittum’s high integrity and com-
mitment to serving his communities have
helped him adapt to the changing landscape
and remain effective in every position he has
held. This commitment has left a lasting im-
pact on the law enforcement community—in
nearly every police department across our
state, one can find officers and officials who
count Director Vittum as both a mentor and
friend.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to
thank Director Vittum and his family for their
decades of dedication to our community. I
congratulate him on his accomplished law en-
forcement career, and I wish him all the best
in his well-deserved retirement.

HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in congratulating five District of Columbia
schools recognized by the U.S. Department of
Education as National Blue Ribbon Schools.
For the past 37 years, the Department of
Education has recognized schools for overall
academic excellence or for reducing achieve-
ment gaps. Since 1982, over 40 schools in the
District have been recognized as National
Blue Ribbon Schools. This year, Alice Deal
Middle School, Blessed Sacrament Elemen-
tary School, John W. Ross Elementary
School, KIPP DC Heights Academy and St.
Peter School were selected as National Blue
Ribbon Schools.
Alice Deal Middle School, located in North-
west DC, was established in 1982 and serves
1,506 students. As an International Bacca-
laureate School, the committed staff and
teachers promote a global learning environ-
ment. Students study one of three lan-
guages—Chinese, French or Spanish—and
have the opportunity to go abroad in 8th
grade. I applaud Alice Deal for developing and
encouraging students to be global citizens and
for its recognition this year as a National Blue
Ribbon School.
Located in Chevy Chase, DC, Blessed Sac-
rament strives to provide quality Catholic edu-
cation through a caring community that pro-
motes academic excellence and a life of serv-
ice. This is the second time Blessed Sac-
rament has been named a National Blue Rib-
bon School. In 2012, Blessed Sacrament was
also recognized as a National Blue Ribbon
School under the category of Exemplary High
Performing Schools. I applaud Blessed Sac-
rament for its recognition this year as a Na-
tional Blue Ribbon School.

October 16, 2019
John W. Ross Elementary School, located
in the heart of Dupont Circle, has shown com-
mitment to hiring excellent teachers who care
deeply about their students. With its school
motto, ‘‘Embraced for who you are and Em-
powered to be more,’’ John W. Ross Elemen-
tary School promotes and values students in a
holistic way. I applaud John W. Ross for its
recognition this year as a National Blue Rib-
bon School.
KIPP DC Heights Academy, located in
Southeast DC, is known for the importance it
places on achievement, community and per-
sistence. Well deserving of this award, KIPP
has closed achievement gaps among student
subgroups, raising the academic playing field
for all. Their strong culture of collaboration and
excellence motivates teachers and students
alike to work together and become stronger
thinkers, readers, writers and mathematicians.
I applaud KIPP DC Heights Academy for its
recognition this year as a National Blue Rib-
bon School.
St. Peter School, located in my own Capitol
Hill neighborhood, was founded in 1868 by the
Sisters of the Holy Cross for the purposes of
taking a holistic approach in order to educate
the whole child. St. Peter School is committed
to cultivating a dedicated team of faculty and
staff in one of the oldest continuously oper-
ating Catholic elementary schools in Wash-
ington, DC. I applaud St. Peter School for its
recognition this year as a National Blue Rib-
bon School.

CELEBRATING THE CITY OF
SANTA ANA’S SESQUICENTENNIAL
HON. HARLEY ROUDA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize and celebrate the 150th Anniver-
sary of the City of Santa Ana, California on
October 27, 2019.
The City or Santa Ana was founded on Oc-
tober 27, 1869 by William H. Spurgeon. Santa
Ana rapidly became a hub for commercial, fi-
nancial, and manufacturing businesses. To
this day, the city remains a key pillar to Or-
ange County and its culture.
The City of Santa Ana, commonly regarded
by locals as ‘‘Downtown Orange County’’ or as
the Golden City for its impressive culture and
lively history, is the second most-populous city
in Orange County with more than 300,000
residents. Located just a few miles away from
the Pacific Ocean, Santa Ana is home to an
array of attractions, including the Santa Ana
Zoo, Grand Central Art Center, Bowers Mu-
seum of Cultural Art, and Discovery Museum
of Orange County.
Today I ask that all Members join me in rec-
ognizing the 150th anniversary of the vibrant
and wonderful City of Santa Ana, California.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE FREE-
LAND AMERICAN LEGION POST
NO. 473 ON ITS 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the Freeland American Le-
gion Post No. 473 on the 100th anniversary of
its founding. The Freeland American Legion
Post No. 473 is a highly respected veterans’
organization located in Northeastern Pennsyl-
vania. In its 100 years, the Post has overcome
many obstacles, but, through the determina-
tion and dedication of its members, it has with-
stood the test of time and flourished.
In December 1919, Freeland American Le-
gion Post No. 473 received its chatter from the
national American Legion organization. The
first members were men who served the U.S.
during World War I as soldiers or in a naval
capacity and received an honorable discharge.
In fall 1920, the first Commander, John
Rugens, presided over the decision to name
the Post ‘‘Freeland Post’’ in honor of the 400
Freeland, Pennsylvania men who enlisted to
serve during World War I.
The early years of Freeland American Le-
gion Post No. 473 saw low membership, but,
under the leadership of Commander R.R.
Oberrender and Commander Thomas
Welshko, the post persevered and eventually
grew into the thriving organization it is today.
In 1924, the first Legion Home was pur-
chased, though it would not be the last.
Through the late 1920s into the 1930s, Free-
land American Legion Post No. 473 moved its
Legion Home to several different locations be-
fore finally relocating in 2000 to its permanent
home at 532 Centre Street in Freeland.
Throughout its 100-year history, the Post
has been a pivotal force within the community.
Freeland’s Semi-Centennial Celebration was
sponsored by Freeland American Legion Post
No. 473, and its members served on several
of the event’s planning committees. The Post
oversaw the planting of a memorial grove
around Freeland High School with name
plates on each tree recognizing service mem-
bers who gave the ultimate sacrifice for their
country. The Legion Auxiliary was eventually
organized, first under temporary Chairlady
Mrs. R.L. Seitzinger, and then Mrs. A.A.
Redelin was elected to inaugurally lead the
Auxiliary. In September 1928, Freeland Amer-
ican Legion Post No. 473 Drum and Bugle
Corps was organized with thirty men partici-
pating, and, by 1930, the group would be rec-
ognized as one of the leading Bugle Corps in
the country.
Today, Freeland American Legion Post 473
is very active and well-respected in the com-
munity. The Post now also encompasses the
American Legion Riders, who help raise funds
for children’s hospitals, schools, veterans’
homes, severely wounded servicemembers,
and scholarships. On September 28, 2019, the
Post donated $1,200 to the District 12 VA
Canteen Fund, and, recently, the Legion Rid-
ers had their 14th Emilio Ranieri Run, which is
an annual event that benefits the daughter of
one of their members.
It is an honor to recognize the Freeland
American Legion Post No. 473 on its 100th
anniversary. This is a remarkable achieve-
ment, and I wish the organization much con-
tinued success in the future.

HON. MIKE ROGERS
OF ALABAMA

Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker,
I ask for the House’s attention to recognize
the retirement of Mike Rollins after 40 years of
service with Coosa Valley Youth Services.
Coosa Valley Youth Services works with the
juvenile court systems of Calhoun County.
Rollins has been involved at the facility in
some form or another since it opened its
doors in 1974. Rollins even spent time as a
detainee when he was in his teens and sev-
eral years after that, he applied to work at the
center part-time in maintenance.
Over the years, he worked his way up to
guard, manager and all the way to the top as
Executive Director. The center has grown and
now has 70 employees and 90 plus program
participants and detainees. Rollins has a heart
for the children and has helped so many of
them get back on the right path.
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Mike and congratulating him on his re-
tirement after a wonderful career.

Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in recognition of the life and con-
tributions of a fierce advocate and vital mem-
ber of the Tampa Bay community, Roger A.
Vaughan, Jr. who passed away on July 3,
2019, at the age of 84. Roger positively im-
pacted Tampa Bay in innumerable ways. He is
survived by his wife of 59 years, Jean, their 4
children, 12 grandchildren, 3 great grand-
children and 4 siblings.
Roger was born in Washington, D.C. and at-
tended St. Anselm’s high school. He grad-
uated from the United States Merchant Marine
Academy in Kings Point, New York, and
earned his law degree from George Wash-
ington University. Roger was admitted to the
Florida Bar in 1964, and just three years later
co-founded his own law firm, located in beau-
tiful downtown Tampa. Roger became a na-
tionally respected maritime lawyer and rep-
resented the claimants in the Sunshine Sky-
way Bridge case. Roger fought for the victims
of one of the worst bridge disasters in history
after a freighter ship struck a pier supporting
the Sunshine Skyway Bridge. His efforts en-
sured that the victims and their families were
properly compensated and that those at fault
were held responsible.
Roger was beloved in the community for his
generosity, his selfless disposition to serving
those in need and loyal devotion to his family.
He also dedicated a large part of his life to
helping seamen, other maritime workers and
the maritime legal community. He co-authored:
‘‘Maritime Law & Practice,’’ The Florida Bar,
1980 Education, 1987 Edition.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the citizens of
Florida and my neighbors across Tampa Bay,
I am proud to honor Roger A. Vaughan, Jr.
Roger represents the best Tampa has to offer,
his advocacy on behalf of victims and families
in the Tampa Bay community is worthy of our
respect. Roger A. Vaughan, Jr. leaves behind
a legacy of fierce advocacy, service and fam-
ily. His legacy is cemented into the history of
our community and will never be forgotten.

Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today

me in recognizing the life and work of Pamela
Wilhoite Stroman on the occasion of her 100th
birthday.
Stroman was born in Rapidan, Virginia on
October 22, 1919. She was the second of
three children. In her early teens, she moved
to Washington, DC, where she attended Gar-
nett Patterson Jr. High School and Armstrong

After passing the government worker’s en-
trance exam, Stroman worked for 35 years at
the Federal Bureau of Engraving and Printing

tired in 1974.
As an avid sports lover, she calls herself
Tiger Wood’s grandmother and coaches him,
and the Washington football team, from her
living room. She wears T-shirts for good luck
and knows all the scores, statistics, players
and officials by name.
Stroman is a resident of Ward 5 in the
Stronghold community, where she is one of
the oldest neighbors. She was one of 15 origi-
nal residents in the ‘‘White Hat Patrol’’, a
group of residents who monitored security in
the neighborhood. She is the mother of two

New Jersey. This year marks the 300th anni-
versary of the settlement of Garretson in 1719,
Thanks to the extraordinary efforts of the vol-
unteers of Garretson Forge and Farm Res-
toration, Inc., this special property has been
preserved and kept open to the community. In
recognition of Garretson’s anniversary, I would
like to include in the RECORD the poem ‘‘A
Heritage to Keep,’’ by William F. Haywood
which captures the long history of Garretson
Forge and Farm, a Bergen County treasure.
The traffic moves in swifter pace
Around the bend that holds this place
In gentle curves where time has flown
And countless passers it has known,
The silent step of moccasin,
The echoing of forge’s din;
A gangling pine saw all of these,
New homes replacing other trees.
The continental soldier came,
Lone hunter seeking wary game,
A farmer tilling fertile soil
Where the river turns its coil.
So generations came and went
Through seasons ill and fairly spent.
The Garretsons had built to last,
While time has added to the past
A heritage for here and now—
To keep it whole should be our vow.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing Garretson Forge and
Farm’s 300th anniversary, I know that we will
continue to enjoy Garretson for many genera-
tions to come.

Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I rise

end of the year, completing a 42-year career
in the construction industry.
Started by Charlie’s father, Joseph, Dunigan
Brothers, Inc. is a well-respected underground
construction company that has serviced the
Jackson area and beyond for more than 70
years. Growing up, Charlie spent many nights
and weekends working for the family-owned
business prior to joining full-time after com-
pleting high school.
Throughout his tenure, Charlie and Dunigan
Brothers have largely specialized in various
types of sewer and water construction
projects, including building critical infrastruc-
ture around more than 20 lakes throughout
Michigan. They played an important role in
safeguarding the beauty and ecosystems of
these lakes, something we take with great
pride in the Great Lakes State.
Despite the many notable projects he has
overseen, Charlie would tell you the most ful-
filling part of his career is the wonderful peo-
ple he has worked with over the years.
Charlie’s days at Dunigan Brothers may be
coming to an end, but his commitment to giv-
ing back and making the community a better
place will be remembered for years to come.
I congratulate Charlie on his long and distin-
guished career, and wish him a happy retire-

City Year San Jose/Silicon Valley (‘‘City

dozen elementary, middle, and high schools.
Its programs reach over 7,000 students each
year through partnerships with public schools
in our most challenged communities.
City Year’s diverse AmeriCorps teams serve
as tutors, mentors, and role models, helping to
provide research-based student, in classrooms
and city wide. City Year strives to help stu-
dents stay in school and on track to graduate
from high school with a solid foundation for
college and future careers. A recent study
showed that students from schools that
partnered with City Year were likely to dem-
onstrate improvement on mathematics and
English language arts assessments.
Madam Speaker, I hereby recognize and
commend City Year for its dedicated work to
improve educational access for all students,
regardless of background. Today, we honor
City Year San Jose/Silicon Valley for 25 years

HONORING LYNDEL ‘‘JOE’’
WISHCAMPER
HON. CHELLIE PINGREE
OF MAINE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, I would
like to extend my congratulations to Lyndel
‘‘Joe’’ Wishcamper on his outstanding advo-
cacy for and production of affordable housing.
I was thrilled to learn that Joe will receive this
year’s Affordable Housing Vision Award from
the National Housing & Rehabilitation Associa-
tion. I cannot think of a more deserving recipi-
ent.
In his nearly 50 years as a community de-
veloper Joe has owned, developed, or rede-
veloped over 15,000 affordable housing units
throughout the country. These include many
units throughout Maine including ones in Port-
land, Eastport, Camden, Freeport, Bath, Rock-
land, and Wiscasset. He became an early
practitioner of historic rehabilitation when he
converted a vacant school building in down-
town Portland to senior affordable housing. He
later reduced their energy costs as well as re-
duced global warming by investing in a solar
farm.
Beyond his work in affordable housing, Joe
has also been an asset to the Maine commu-
nity serving on the boards of countless busi-
nesses and nonprofits, including Maine Med-
ical Center, the Nature Conservancy, and the
University of Maine System. In recognition of
his contributions to the community he has
been awarded both the Spurwink Humani-
tarian of the Year and the Colby College Phi-
lanthropy Award.
While we are very proud of Joe and his con-
tributions to his home state, this is a national
award and many states have benefitted from
his work and his philanthropy. His life’s work
has earned him many honors. This is a par-
ticularly significant one that merits special
note.
Congratulations to Joe Wishcamper for this
award. I look forward to his continued efforts
to create safe, decent, and affordable housing
and to his many philanthropic endeavors.

IN MEMORY OF JACK VAN LOAN
HON. JOE WILSON
OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam
Speaker, America and South Carolina have
lost a True Hero and Patriot in the passing of
Col. Jack Van Loan. Roxanne and I offer our
deepest sympathies to his wife Linda and his
family. The fitting tribute is from The State of
Columbia, South Carolina:
Jack Van Loan, an Oregon native and
fighter pilot who spent six years in the infa-
mous Hanoi Hilton as a prisoner of war in
Vietnam and then served for 20 years as ex-
ecutive director of the Five Points Associa-
tion in Columbia, has died. He was 87.
‘‘He was a mentor, a colleague, a co-chair
and a friend to me,’’ former Five Points As-
sociation executive director Merritt
McNeely posted on Facebook. ‘‘More than
that, he was a true American hero and he
loved and fought for Five Points like no one
else. Rest In Peace my friend, Jack.’’
Mayor Steve Benjamin said city flags will
be flown at half-staff this week in Van
Loan’s honor.
‘‘He was a gentleman, stern, loving and a
leader,’’ the mayor said. ‘‘These men served
our country in some of the most challenging
situations, never lost their spirit and contin-
ued to serve. Jack led the charge in Five
Points. When Jack calls you come. He was
unique. He was special.’’
Van Loan received his undergraduate de-
gree from Oregon State in 1954. He spent 30
years in the Air Force. He was a POW for six
years, held in the same prison as the late
Sen. John McCain.
Van Loan was shot down over North Viet-
nam on May 20, 1967. He injured his knee
when he parachuted, and his captors made
the injury worse through torture.
The torture, which became more horri-
fying, continued for most of his six years of
captivity.
Van Loan published a book about his expe-
rience in captivity, ‘‘Chained Eagles, The
Story of Col. Jack Van Loan and the Viet-
nam POWs in North Vietnam.’’
He wrote the book because he thought
what the POWs experienced needed to be re-
membered.
‘‘I kept being asked questions about it and
realized I needed to write it up,’’ he told The
State. ‘‘It was a very difficult thing for me
to do, to write it out.’’
Van Loan quickly learned his captors had
no intention of adhering to the Geneva Con-
vention, a treaty adopted to protect pris-
oners of war from the atrocities he suffered.
The North Vietnamese torturers unsuccess-
fully tried to beat information from him.
He wrote in his book, ‘‘I wasn’t going to
tell them about those targets, but I was
going to have to come up with something. I
tried to knock myself out by beating my
head on the floor but that didn’t work out.
All I was doing was bloodying up my fore-
head and getting blood in my eyes.
‘‘I just was a total mess. . . . I had just
never, ever experienced any pain like that. I
just didn’t think that it was possible.’’
Van Loan was released on March 4, 1973,
with the second large group of POWs to be
freed after the Paris Peace Accords ended
America’s involvement in the war. He had
been held for 70 months.
Van Loan, a colonel, settled in Columbia
after retiring from duty at Shaw Air Force
Base in Sumter. He served for 20 years as ex-
ecutive director of the Five Points Associa-
tion, and is credited with being the force be-
hind the success of the urban village’s an-
nual St. Patrick’s Day celebration.
He is honored with a statue in Five Points
that portrays him emerging from captivity.
At the time the statue was dedicated, Van
Loan was honored by the like of U.S. Sen.
Lindsey Graham, R–SC.
‘‘Jack sacrificed for his country in a way
few have ever done,’’ Graham said at the
time. ‘‘As a POW he stayed true to the tradi-
tions of an American fighting man held in
captivity. He’s an inspiration, a role model,
and a credit to South Carolina in every
way.’’

BENJAMIN MOORE
HON. JOSH GOTTHEIMER
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize a great American company
with a steadfast commitment to American
manufacturing and job creation headquartered
in my District, the Fifth Congressional District
of New Jersey.
Benjamin Moore currently employs approxi-
mately 1,000 individuals and is headquartered
in Montvale, New Jersey. Since its founding in
1883, in Brooklyn, Benjamin Moore has main-
tained an unwavering commitment to selling
only through authorized, independent, locally-
owned and operated paint and decorating re-
tailers.
From Benjamin’s Moore’s humble begin-
nings in 1883 with one product—Moore’s Pre-
pared Calsom Finish—to now, one of Amer-
ica’s leading manufacturers of paints, stains
and finishes, is truly a great American story.
In the Fifth District of New Jersey, Benjamin
Moore has maintained a commitment to cre-
ating jobs and manufacturing their paints and
stains in America.
Benjamin Moore has also made sustainable
manufacturing practices a major component of
their company practice, leading to receiving
the ‘‘Green’’ Good Housekeeping Seal and the
Edison ‘‘Best New Product Award for Sustain-
ability.’’ In 2015, the Asthma and Allergy
Foundation of America announced that Ben-
jamin Moore’s most environmentally friendly
paint, Natura, has been certified Asthma and
Allergy Friendly.
As the Representative for the Fifth Congres-
sional District of New Jersey, I am proud to
recognize Benjamin Moore for their commit-
ment to American jobs and manufacturing,
sustainability, and all that the company has
accomplished.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing Benjamin Moore for the
company’s commitment to the Fifth Congres-
sional District of New Jersey and to the coun-
try and look forward to many great years
ahead.

REMEMBERING E.A. CARMEAN, JR.
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to note the passing of art historian E.A.
Carmean, Jr., who died Saturday in our na-
tion’s capital at age 74. Mr. Carmean was the
founding curator of 20th century art at the Na-
tional Gallery of Art in Washington from 1974
to 1984, working to open the I.M. Pei-de-
signed East Building for its Modernist collec-
tion in 1978. During his tenure at the National
Gallery of Art, he curated important exhibitions
on Georges Braque and David Smith, and on
individual works, such as Picasso’s The
Saltimbanques, in 1980. He also acquired im-
portant works for the national gallery, including
Jackson Pollack’s Number 1, 1950 (Lavender
Mist), and commissioned some of the last
public works by such masters as Joan Miro,
Henry Moore and Alexander Calder. In 1984,
he was appointed director of the Modem Art
Museum of Fort Worth and, from 1992 to
1997, led the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art.
In Memphis during his tenure, the Brooks
hosted exhibitions on the watercolors of John
James Audubon, the Jewels of the Romanovs
and medieval icons. Mr. Carmean left the
Brooks to enter Memphis Theological Semi-
nary and later joined the staff of St. George’s
Episcopal Church in Germantown, Tennessee,
and was named Lay Canon for Art and Archi-
tecture by the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese
of West Tennessee with a license to preach.
Born in Springfield, Illinois, Mr. Carmean re-
ceived a B.A. in Art History from MacMurray
College in Jacksonville, Illinois, and worked to-
ward but did not complete an M.A. at the Uni-
versity of Illinois, while teaching. He was later
given an honorary doctorate from MacMurray.
After leaving the museum world, he contin-
ued to write about art and religion, often for
The Wall Street Journal, which in September
published his ‘‘A Choice at the Final Minute,’’
a meditation on the 15th century Hieronymous
Bosch alterpiece Death and the Miser. He also
wrote the forward to Elvis: The Personal Ar-
chives, a selection of Elvis photographs that
were part of an exhibit at the Andy Warhol
Museum in Pittsburgh, in 2005.
I would like to extend my condolences to his
wife, Kathryn Shelton Carmean, his daughter,
Elizabeth Carmean Adams, and his two grand-
children, as well as members of the St.
George’s community in Germantown and his
many friends and admirers. He led an inspired
life.

HON. GWEN MOORE

Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize the 2019 Week of Positive Change,
Nonviolence and Opportunities which runs
from October 12 to October 19, 2019. This
week was created to remind us of the toll that
violence is taking in our communities but also
to remind and reaffirm that we can all help to
end the violence.
During this week, events will take place in
communities throughout the nation to discuss
solutions and partnerships that will help to pro-
tect our communities from violence. I urge my
colleagues to learn more about the events in
their communities.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1294 October 16, 2019
As Congress considers ways to address the
deadly gun violence that is plaguing too many
of our communities, one of the central themes
and solutions to consider are ways to increase
resources and training available to community
members themselves to help prevent or de-es-
calate conflict that can help break the deadly
cycle that violence has in our communities.
There is no question that stronger gun laws
are an important part of efforts to prevent gun
violence. I again urge Senator MCCONNELL to
take up the bills the House has already
passed that would help strengthen background
checks, a move which is broadly supported by
the American public, and to close the Charles-
ton loophole that allows gun sales to go
through if not completed within three days.
But just as critical is the need to develop
and strengthen community wide resources and
tools that can help prevent violence, including
gun violence, in the first place. One such way
is to increase support so that a broader range
of individuals in communities can learn conflict
prevention and de-escalation and violence
interruption strategies that can help prevent
situations from turning violent while helping to
connect individuals to community supports.
Now more than ever we need to explore all
the ways to end this epidemic of violence. A
study published in the October 2019 issue of
Health Affairs shows that the rate at which
Americans died from firearm injuries increased
sharply starting in 2015. And while high profile
mass shootings make up a small portion of
these incidences, the vast majority are from
the daily violence that too many of our com-
munities continue to endure.
According to that study, the United States
saw a 14 percent rise in the rate of gun-re-
lated deaths of all kinds from 2015 to 2017
compared with the rate from 1999 to 2014.
Like other cities around the country, the city
of Milwaukee has experienced multiple forms
of violence that have caused significant injury
and trauma for individuals, families, and neigh-
borhoods. From 2010 to 2016, there has been
a 76 percent increase in firearm-related homi-
cide victims, a 38 percent increase in nonfatal
shooting victims, and a 43 percent increase in
combined victims.
During this time of crisis with violence hap-
pening around the country, we need to focus
on how all elements of our society, govern-
ment and the communities themselves, can
work to help end violence.
We need to invest in policies and programs
that could literally save lives. Communities
standing together can make a difference.
I applaud the organizations that have come
together to sponsor this week and help make
our communities safer including Black Women
for Positive Change, the National Black
Nurses Association, Moms Demand Action
and others.
In addition, governors in Wisconsin, Colo-
rado, Michigan, and Virginia have all issued
proclamations recognizing this week.

HONORING ROCKLAND COMMUNITY
COLLEGE

Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor Rockland Community College as the in-
stitution begins a year-long celebration of its
60th anniversary this month.
Six decades ago, a group of community
leaders boldly transformed an old almshouse
and 27 acres of farm land into an institution of
higher education. Since then, Rockland Com-
munity College has provided quality, afford-
able education to students of all ages and
been an important resource to the residents of
the Lower Hudson Valley.
The institution’s motto—‘‘to learn, to search,
to serve’’—has guided students in their aca-
demic journeys ensuring they are supported
every step of the way. With more than 500 full
and part-time faculty members, support and
one-on-one help is readily available to all stu-
dents.
Madam Speaker, I urge my fellow Members
of Congress to join me in expressing con-
gratulations and thanks to both former and
current Rockland Community College adminis-
trators, Board members, faculty, staff and stu-
dents for making and keeping the college such
a vibrant part of our community for 60 years.

RECOGNIZING HISTORIC DOWN-
TOWN DELAWARE, OHIO FOR
THEIR DESIGNATION OF ‘‘GREAT
NEIGHBORHOOD’’ BY THE AMER-

HON. TROY BALDERSON
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to celebrate Delaware, Ohio as they are
recognized by the American Planning Associa-
tion as one of America’s ‘‘Great Neighbor-
hoods.’’
The American Planning Association intro-
duced the first of its annual ‘‘Great Places’’ list
in 2007 as a way to acknowledge the inge-
nuity and precision of city planners, city mem-
bers, and local organizations around the coun-
try. The American Planning Association strives
to expose the importance of city planners and
their impact on communities.
Chosen from a pool of 200 nominees,
Downtown Delaware became one of four
neighborhoods around the country to receive
this prestigious title. Throughout the nomina-
tion process, Downtown Delaware stood out
for its outstanding revitalization and attention
to the city’s history. This impressive balance
between historical preservation and innovative
expansion can be credited to the city planners,
business owners, workers, and community
members of Historic Downtown Delaware that
dedicated their time to improving their city.
The historic downtown area remains as one
of Delaware’s defining elements. Rooted in
200 years of history, Downtown Delaware’s
charm and antiquity have withstood the test of
time. This achievement showcases both the
beauty of this historic community as well as
the thorough planning that went into the cre-
ation of Downtown Delaware. Downtown Dela-
ware’s revival has been decades in the mak-
ing and Delaware’s nomination as one of
America’s Great Neighborhoods is the honor
this city and its dedicated citizens deserve.
Downtown Delaware’s established history,
set alongside up-and-coming innovations and
improvements, creates for a one-of-a-kind city
found in the heart of Ohio. The efforts of
Downtown Delaware’s city planners and the
community as a whole set high standards for
cities all over America. As the city of Delaware
celebrates its new title with the community on
Thursday, October 17th, I cannot express how
honored I am to serve the committed people
of Delaware as their efforts resulted in this na-
tional recognition.

HONORING MR. LUIS LAURO
LONGORIA
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor Mr. Luis Lauro Longoria,
a marine, a father, and a leader.
Mr. Longoria was born in La Grulla, Texas,
on June 5, 1950, before he moved to Long-
view, Texas. In Longview, Luis attended Hart
High School and graduated alongside a high
school class of 32 students. After high school,
Luis make the selfless and honorable decision
to enlist in the military—at only 18 years old.
Mr. Luis Lauro Longoria chose to enlist in
the United States Marine Corps in 1968,
where he became a M60 Machine Gunner and
a Recon Marine. Mr. Longoria honorably
served in the Vietnam War and was stationed
at Marine Quang Tri Province DMZ, Vietnam.
While enlisted in the United States Marine
Corps, Mr. Longoria served this country for
four years of his early life, experiencing many
aspects of military life.
Mr. Luis Lauro Longoria was decorated with
two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star Medal
for the injuries he sustained and courage he
showed during his time in Vietnam. Everything
we hold dear as a community, state, and
country is owed to the brave sacrifice of serv-
ice members like Mr. Longoria. I know that his
legacy will inspire future generations to honor-
ably serve our fellow man.
Mr. Longoria later returned to the United
States where he met and married his wife,
Olivia Longoria. Luis and Olivia have now
been married for over 40 years and are the
proud parents to their two sons, Luis Longoria
II and Oly Longoria.
Madam Speaker, Mr. Luis Lauro Longoria
fought to defend the values of the United
States during the Vietnam War. He sacrificed
his body, not once, but twice to accomplish
the missions he was tasked with. He serves
as both a light in our community and a leader.
It is an honor to represent a dedicated and
selfless individual who has greatly impacted
the future of the United States and our be-
loved community. I wish Mr. Longoria the best
in his future endeavors. I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1295
October 16, 2019
Due to the Southeast’s unique rivers that
produce red clay deposits, North Carolina has
long been at the center of the brick making
economy. This includes companies like
Statesville Brick Company which opened its
doors in 1891. As times changed though and
the post-World War II building boom began to
slow, brick makers began closing shop, and
small, local operations transitioned into large,
interstate corporations. Statesville Brick Com-
pany, however, bucked that trend, and re-
mains at heart the same family-run operation
it was over a century ago.
For Statesville Brick Company Chief Execu-
tive Officer Michael Foster and President
James E. ‘‘Sonny’’ Rankin, Jr. along with Ex-
ecutive Vice President Scott A. Rankin and
Quality Control Manager Adam Foster, the
brick business is a generational affair. Sonny’s
grandfather E.R. ‘‘Roy’’ Rankin joined the
company in 1916 and oversaw the construc-
tion of an early iteration of the firm’s plant
while Michael’s father, H.B. ‘‘Bob’’ Foster
joined as a partner in 1969. Today, Statesville
Brick Company currently employs over 90
people and their work can be found at some
of our nation’s most prestigious academic in-
stitutions such as Princeton University, Ohio
State University, and Davidson College.
Statesville Brick Company’s 128 years of

PASSING OF MS. ELIZABETH J.
WESLEY
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, it is with
great sadness that I rise today to honor Ms.
Elizabeth ‘‘Libby’’ Wesley, an extraordinary ac-
tivist and dear friend from Palm Beach Coun-
ty, Florida.
Ms. Wesley was born in Defuniak Springs,
Florida to William and Allie Mae Jackson. In
1958, she moved to Delray Beach, Florida
where she began her 37-year career in the
field of education as a classroom teacher, in-
structional television educator, and project
manager of early childcare welfare and serv-
ices with the Palm Beach County School Dis-
trict. Her steadfast commitment to quality edu-
cation on the local, state, and national level
and her expertise in the field of early child-
hood education and development was highly
sought after by leading parent advocacy
groups, businesses, and national and local
legislators.
Ms. Wesley, affectionately known as Libby,
gifted her talents, time, and voice to the com-
munity as a prolific speaker, soloist, commu-
nity activist, organizer, and innovator.
Throughout her 61 years as a member of St.
Paul AME, she served as the church sec-
retary, on the trustee board and finance com-
mittee, and lifted the spirits of the congrega-
tion with her signature rendition of Amazing
Grace. Libby became a member of Zeta Phi
Beta Sorority, Inc. in 1954 at Florida A&M Uni-
versity. She continued the works of her be-
loved sisterhood first as a member of Delta
Epsilon Zeta Chapter in West Palm Beach,
and later a founding member of the Tri-City
Chapter Omicron Delta Zeta.
Perhaps Ms. Wesley’s most impactful com-
munity legacy was her role as a co-founder of
the Roots Cultural Festival in Delray Beach.
Her leadership of this festival grew a weekend
celebrating Black American excellence and Af-
rican culture into a year-round youth program
that included music, culture, education, and
athletic components.
Ms. Wesley was also the recipient of numer-
ous prestigious awards for her contributions in
the areas of volunteerism and leadership, in-
cluding the Old School Square Life Achieve-
ment award, the Delray Beach Rotary Service
Above Self award, the Sojourner Truth Living
History award, the Jefferson Award, the JM
Family Enterprises The Prestigious African-
American Achiever’s Award, the Publisher’s
Award from the Sun Sentinel, as well as the
building and dedication of The Elizabeth
‘‘Libby’’ Jackson Wesley Plaza in Delray
Beach.
Madam Speaker, my friend Libby dedicated
her life to serving our community. She was ad-
mired, respected, and beloved by all. I want to
extend my heartfelt condolences to her family
and friends, during this time of great sadness.
She will be dearly missed.

WAR VETERANS OF ILLINOIS
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor the World War II, Korean War, and Viet-
nam War veterans who traveled to Wash-
ington, D.C. on October 16, 2019 with Honor
Flight Chicago, a program that provides World
War II, Korean War, and Vietnam War vet-
erans the opportunity to visit their memorials
on The National Mall in Washington, D.C.
These memorials were built to honor their
courage and service to their country.
The American Veteran is one of our great-
est treasures. The Soldiers, Airmen, Sailors,
Marines, and Coast Guardsmen who traveled
here on October 16th answered our nation’s
call to service during several of its greatest
times of need. Across the world, these brave
Americans risked life and limb, gave service
and sacrificed much, all while embodying what
it is to be a hero. We owe them more grati-
tude than can ever be expressed.
I welcome these brave veterans to Wash-
ington and to their memorials. I am proud to
include in the RECORD the names of these
men and women for all to see, hear, and rec-
ognize, and I call on my colleagues to rise and
join me in expressing gratitude.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF LT.
JOSEPH PETROSINO
HON. THOMAS R. SUOZZI
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the life and legacy of Giuseppe
‘‘Joe’’ Petrosino, NYPD Badge No. 285. 110
years ago, Lt. Petrosino was assassinated in
Sicily while investigating organized crime and
became the first NYPD officer killed overseas
in the line of duty.
Born in Padula (Sa.), Italy on August 30th,
1860, Lt. Del. Petrosino rose to fame in New
York for cracking down on organized crime
throughout the city. ‘‘The Detective in the
Derby’’, as he was known in Little Italy, was
the architect of the Bomb Squad, the Canine
Squad, and the Undercover Squad and his
techniques are still used by law enforcement
today.
Petrosino and his family immigrated to the
United States from Padula (in the province of

Salerno, Campania) in the 1870s. In 1883, he
joined the NYPD and became the first native
Italian-language speaker in the department’s
history. During his service, Petrosino grew
close to then-police commissioner Theodore
Roosevelt and rose through the ranks of the
service. In 1895, he was promoted to Detec-
tive Sergeant and was placed in charge of the
department’s Homicide Division, making him
the first Italian-American to lead this depart-
ment.
Petrosino’s career reached it pinnacle in
1908 when he was promoted to Lieutenant
and placed in charge of the Italian Squad, an
elite corps of Italian-American detectives spe-
cifically assembled to deal with the activities of
organized crime groups.
Unfortunately, Lt. Petrosino’s life was cut
short by an assassin in Piazza Marina, Pa-
lermo, Italy on March 12, 1909, while he was
collecting evidence to be used against the
mafia. Lt. Petrosino’s body was returned to
New York and a funeral was held on April 12,
1909; over 250,000 people were in attend-
ance. New York City declared the day of his
burial a holiday to allow its citizens to pay their
respects.
A small plaza just north of the old NYPD
Headquarters at 240 Center Street in Manhat-
tan was renamed in his memory, but his true
legacy lives on in the hearts and minds of his
surviving family members: granddaughter
Susan Burke, grandnephew Assistant District
Attorney Joseph Petrosino, NYPD Officer Jo-
seph Petrosino, and, in Italy, grandnephew
and founder of the Joe Petrosino International
Association Nino Melito-Petrosino.
Lt. Petrosino’s mark extends far beyond
New York City. Over 100 years after his
death, The Lt Det. Joseph Petrosino Associa-
tion in America continues the tribute to an
NYPD and Italian icon by forming a trinity with
the Joe Petrosino International Association in
Padula (Sa.) Italy and the Joe Petrosino Asso-
ciation in Sicily, Italy; this trinity continues to
perpetuate his memory, his values, and his
fight against crime.
I would like to thank the board members of
the Lt. Det. Joseph Petrosino Association in
America for their tireless advocacy for New
York police departments; Cav. Joseph
Mattone, Dr. Joseph Scelsa, and James Lisa,
Chairman of the Lt. Joseph Petrosino Associa-
tion in America. I would also like to recognize
Robert (Bob) Fonti, President of the Lt. Jo-
seph Petrosino Association in American,
Vincenzo Lamanna, President of the
Associazione Internazionale Joe Petrosino,
Padula (Sa.) Italy, and Anna Maria Corradini,
President of the Association ‘‘Joe Petrosino’’
Sicilia, Palermo, Italy.
Fighting crime, unfortunately, sometimes re-
quires the sacrifice of an untold number of
men and women in blue. We thank them and
their families for putting themselves in harm’s
way on our behalf.
