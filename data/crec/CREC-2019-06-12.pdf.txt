THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN SEE
THROUGH THIS FACADE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
and still I rise because I love my coun-
try.
Mr. Speaker, I rise some 56 days since
the Mueller report was made public; 56
days, according to some, and I have
been among them, to say that the
President has been above the law for 56
days pursuant to the Mueller report.
But the truth is the President has
been above the law for more than 2
years because, more than 2 years ago, I
stood at this podium and called for the
impeachment of the President of the
United States of America for his ob-
struction that we now acknowledge
was obstruction—more than 2 years.
More than 2 years, now, of analysis pa-
ralysis. As Dr. King put it, the paral-
ysis of analysis—more than 2 years.
What does this mean, paralysis anal-
ysis? Well, I have my pneumonic notes.
It means that we are allowing the
perfect to be an enemy of the good,
that we are waiting for the perfect op-
portunity to do what we should rather
than doing that which is good, which
we can do now.
It also means overthinking a problem
and not analyzing to the extent that
you never make a decision, and in some
cases, it means allowing perfection
protection.
Some people will do it simply be-
cause knowing you cannot achieve per-
fection, it becomes a means by which
they can achieve perfection—perfection
protection.
And along the way, over these 2
years, Mr. Speaker, here is what we
have had to deal with.
The first question was: What crime
has the President committed? Well, we
know now that you don’t have to com-
mit a crime to be impeached. Constitu-
tional scholars have finally acknowl-
edged it publicly, and others have ac-
cepted it—no crime necessary. Andrew
Johnson was impeached in 1868 in arti-
cle 10 of the Articles of Impeachment
against him, and it was not for com-
mission of a crime.
Then we had to deal with outsourcing
of the investigation. Let’s not do it
ourselves. Let’s not do what the Fram-
ers of the Constitution intended Con-
gress to do. Let’s give it to somebody
else. Let’s have some special counsel
do it.
And then, of course, thereafter, there
was: Wait for the Mueller report. ‘‘Wait
for the Mueller report,’’ a constant re-
frain. We waited for the Mueller report.
The Mueller report has been presented,
some 56 days it has been made public.
And now we are dealing with the
whole notion of some of these votes
may be hard votes. I know a little bit
about hard votes. I have got some min-
isters who are not as friendly as they
used to be because of some hard votes
that I have taken right here on the
floor of the House of Representatives.
And then, of course, we have this no-
tion that we have to have a rock-solid
case. Maybe not in these words, but we
have to have a rock-solid case. Again,
to some extent this is analysis by pa-
ralysis.
And finally, I will mention today,
this, the whole notion that ‘‘I am
against impeachment, although I am
for it. I am against it, but I am for it.’’
Realizing that, in the final analysis, if
we don’t impeach, ‘‘Well, I was always
against it’’; if we do impeach, ‘‘Well, I
was for it, but I just want to make sure
we do it right.’’
‘‘I am against it, but I am for it.’’
Don’t you know that the American
people can see through this facade?
This is but a veneer. People can see be-
yond the veneer. People understand
that you can’t be for it and against it
at the same time. What a paradox.
At some point, to impeach, you have
to use the term ‘‘impeach.’’ At some
point, the Judiciary Committee has to
be the powerful Judiciary Committee
that has been of old. At some point, we
have to stand up. Either we will hold a
ruthless, reckless, lawless President
accountable, or we are all going to be
held accountable.
People are worried about the general
election. Well, there is a primary be-
fore the general election. It is time for
us to do our jobs. Paralysis analysis
cannot prevent us from doing that
which the Framers of the Constitution
have accorded us as our responsibility.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4436 June 12, 2019
I refuse to allow this to continue. We
will have impeachment of this Presi-
dent brought to the floor of the House
of Representatives.
Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the
time, as time is running out for us to
continue to analyze to the extent that
we are paralyzed.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
HONORING AMERICA’S TEACHERS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate
America’s hardworking, dedicated, and
passionate teachers.
Mr. Speaker, I am sure every Member
of this House can think of a teacher
who had a positive influence not only
on their education, but on their life.
Teachers push students to achieve
their best, and they show students how
to realize their full potential. Some-
times, it is the interest of just one
teacher that can transform the life of a
young person.
Teachers are often the most under-
rated, yet powerful, professionals in
the entire world. They truly do shape
young minds.
That is why, last week, I was proud
to introduce H.R. 3108, the Teachers
Are Leaders Act. This bipartisan legis-
lation, led by Congressman BRAD
SCHNEIDER, seeks to expand profes-
sional development and leadership
growth opportunities for teachers.
Under the current law, the Federal
Teacher Quality Partnership grant
connects local schools with nearby col-
leges and universities to create profes-
sional development programs for new
teachers. However, there are not
enough opportunities for established
teachers to develop leadership and peer
mentoring skills that can help retain
teachers and boost student achieve-
ment.
The Teachers Are Leaders Act would
expand the Teacher Quality Partner-
ship grants by making teacher leader
programs focused on professional de-
velopment for established teachers eli-
gible for funding. These programs
would focus on peer coaching, family
and community engagement, cur-
riculum development, and other ways
to make full use of their experience as
educators and leaders within their
communities.
If schools want to recruit and retain
high-quality teachers, then they must
treat them like the professionals that
they are. That means we must allow
them to grow both inside and outside
the classroom.
Mr. Speaker, professional develop-
ment is essential in all positions, espe-
cially for those who are educating the
next generation. Now I am pleased that
this bipartisan legislation devotes the
resources necessary to give teachers
the tools to become even stronger lead-
ers for our youth.
Teachers lend a caring hand and ex-
tend a loving heart. They make dif-
ferences in the lives of our students
academically, emotionally, and phys-
ically. This legislation strengthens the
teaching profession and lets them take
their experience to the next level. I en-
courage my colleagues to support the
Teachers Are Leaders Act today.
f
RECOGNIZING THE ANNIVERSARY
OF THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB
SHOOTING
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS) for 5 minutes.
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, today
my community gathers in Orlando to
remember 49 victims of gun violence.
The Pulse shooting, 3 years ago today,
was the worst terrorist attack in our
Nation since 9/11.
Recall for a moment that, even now,
there is no Federal law to ban LGBTQ
discrimination. The House passed the
Equality Act, but the Senate has re-
fused to bring the legislation to the
floor for a vote.
Yet in spite of these challenges, there
are still places in America that are
meant to be safe havens. The Pulse
nightclub was such a place, a place
where patrons could, as my bishop put
it, enjoy a late night fellowship.
The victims of Pulse were not in the
wrong place at the wrong time. They
had every right to be there. And while
Congress continues to offer thoughts
and prayers, the victims were gunned
down while they celebrated birthdays
and family and friendships.
Let me remind my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle what the Bible
says. It says that ‘‘faith without works
is dead.’’
Today we remember the victims, but
their stories did not end in the early
morning hours 3 years ago. The memo-
ries of those who died live on in our
hearts, and the struggles and triumphs
of the survivors are ever before us.
Some survivors suffered severe inju-
ries. Others were not physically injured
but still carry the invisible wounds of
that tragic moment.
One survivor, Orlando Torres, said
that the mental scars are never forgot-
ten. Orlando spent hours trapped in the
bathroom at Pulse, his clothes soaked
in the blood of the people who had been
shot. He says: ‘‘I still worry about it
happening again. No matter where I
am, I always look for the exit. You
don’t want to get cornered.’’
Orlando spoke about the networks of
survivors who, in America, help each
other after each mass shooting. He
pointed out what we all now know,
that after New Zealand’s shooting, New
Zealand took immediate action.
How many more innocent Americans
need to die before we take action here?
But still, after all that Orlando has
gone through, he remains positive—
simply amazing. The attacks, he says,
allowed the survivors to share with the
world the humanity of the LGBTQ
community and show that we are all
God’s children. He also said: ‘‘I still go
out. If we stop dancing and loving each
other, they win.’’
Sadly, mass shootings are the prod-
uct of our failure to pass legislation de-
signed to keep guns out of the wrong
hands. Many victims in the Pulse
nightclub shooting and shootings
across our Nation did not stand a
chance of survival because they were
shot with weapons designed for war.
This is not the America that we were
created to be.
In the days and weeks following the
Pulse nightclub massacre, many of us
spoke about how central Florida came
together, on one accord, to help our
community. I could not be prouder of
the people in my hometown who came
together to stand up for and stand with
brokenhearted families and friends and
to protect our community.
The victims of Pulse nightclub be-
long to us, and we will never forget the
lives they lived or their tremendous po-
tential that will never be realized.
Today we remember and, through that
remembrance, we transform hate into
love and loss into strength.
f
HONORING LUTHER EUGENE
ROLLINS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN) for 5
minutes.
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to celebrate the life of Luther
Eugene Rollins. Gene, as he was better
known, was the son of Mr. and Mrs.
James F. Rollins of Greer, South Caro-
lina.
Gene, like many Americans, wanted
to serve his country, and he joined the
Army during the Vietnam war and was
assigned to Company A in the 6th Bat-
talion Infantry in the 9th Division.
The commander of his battalion was
Captain Vernon Green, who quickly be-
came his lifelong friend. Gene’s unit
was known as the Polecats or Bearcats
and, in March of 1968, was assigned to
the advance party in Southeast Asia.
b 1015
While serving in combat on the front
lines, he quickly became known as the
‘‘preacher’’ because of his daily reading
of the Bible and dedicated prayer life.
During an attack on his battalion,
Gene was asked to lead his men in
prayer, which he did on numerous occa-
sions. Gene credits his many prayers to
God as the reason for his survival dur-
ing an attack when his M60 machine
gun jammed and he was unable to re-
turn fire to the enemy.
Gene became a radio operator during
his service in Vietnam, attaining the
rank of platoon sergeant. When his
best friend, Captain Green was pro-
moted to the battalion staff, Gene was
invited to join him. He declined to do

so saying, ‘‘I want to stay with my
men.’’ As he later told members of his
hometown church, his service in the
Vietnam war was a ‘‘missionary jour-
ney’’ where he was doing what God
wanted him to do. For Sergeant Rol-
lins’ heroic efforts, he was awarded the
Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts.
After the war, he returned to Rock
Hill, South Carolina, where he married
his wife, Brenda Faye, and had three
children, a son, Wendell, and two
daughters, Tabatha and Tonya. He
worked as a machinist for several years
until joining Duke Energy in June of
1973 where he was an operator and coor-
dinator for maintenance, working until
March of 2016 at the Catawba Nuclear
Station in York County, South Caro-
lina.
Just as Gene Rollins had heeded the
call of God during his service in Viet-
nam, he continued to serve his Lord by
joining Woodhaven Baptist Church,
where he served as Sunday school su-
perintendent, finance committee mem-
ber, and usher. Gene and his family
united with their grandchildren by
joining Calvary Baptist Church. And as
said by Pastor Reggie Hopkins, ‘‘We
love having a man of God like Gene
Rollins and his family’’ in our church.
He spends his time by continuing to
serve his fellow man by cutting his
neighbor’s grass, giving rides to those
who need medical care, and numerous
other tasks that epitomize the saying
‘‘to live is to serve.’’
Gene Rollins is a man who continues
to serve his God, his country, his fam-
ily, and, just as our Savior Jesus Christ
did, his fellow man.
May God continue to bless Gene Rol-
lins for years to come.

DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL
PULSE MEMORIAL
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. SOTO) for 5 minutes.
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, nearly 3
years ago, on this date, we lost 49 an-
gels and 53 others were injured. Family
and friends grieved for their loved ones
and our Orlando community mourned.
But we came together, stronger than
ever before, to heal, to comfort each
other, to overcome this tragedy, and,
most importantly, to give back.
As Orlando Strong, we swore, as a
community, to never forget those who
we lost that night—their stories, their
images, their memories, and their spir-
its—which live on in our hearts and our
memories. We can never forget this
tragic act of hate against the LGBTQ
and Latinx community: our commu-
nity. We continue to reject these des-
picable acts of hate.
To honor the fallen and the survivors
of this tragedy, I joined with my col-
leagues, Representatives STEPHANIE
MURPHY and VAL DEMINGS, to intro-
duce landmark legislation to designate
the Pulse nightclub as a federally rec-
ognized national memorial site. This
designation gives these hallowed
grounds the national recognition it de-
serves, while serving as a reminder
that love overcomes hate.
Let the Pulse memorial become a
symbol of hope, love, and continued
light for our community. We will al-
ways remember the 49 angels:

DO-NOTHING SENATE
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, there is
something rotten in the city of Wash-
ington. There is an injustice brewing in
this Capitol. And there is a sinister
plot afoot in this Congress.
On the one hand, we have the peo-
ple’s House, the House of Representa-
tives, where we are working every day
and passing major legislation—our For
the People Agenda—and, on the Senate
side, we see something very different—
inaction, stagnancy. In essence, they
are doing nothing.
Our For the People House is passing
laws that combat corruption in D.C.
and strengthen election security. Our
For the People House is lowering pre-
scription drug prices. Our For the Peo-
ple House is passing the Equality Act,
Dream Act, universal background
checks, and others.

HONORING WILL D. LINDSAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Colorado (Mr. TIPTON) for 5 minutes.
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor Sergeant First Class
Will D. Lindsay from Cortez, Colorado,
an American soldier, who was recently
killed defending our country in the
Kunduz province of Afghanistan.
He and Specialist Joseph Collette,
both Fort Carson based soldiers, were
killed in an attack fighting against the
Taliban.
Sergeant Lindsay was born in Cortez
in 1985. The grandson of World War II
veteran, Richard Lindsay, and World
War II veteran, Warren Waldorf, he was
no stranger to service. He followed his
grandfather’s footsteps when he en-
listed in the Army in 2004, ultimately,
getting selected into the elite 10th Spe-
cial Forces Group.
This prestigious fighting group de-
ploys to some of the world’s most heat-
ed combat zones. Sergeant Lindsay
bravely deployed with them seven
times, including five tours in Iraq, one
in Tajikistan, and this final deploy-
ment to Afghanistan.
As a highly decorated combat vet-
eran, Sergeant Lindsay had an expan-
sive list of military awards and decora-
tions to include a Silver Star, Purple
Heart, four Bronze Stars, two Meri-
torious Service Medals, two Meri-
torious Unit Commendation, the Val-
orous Unit Award, the Army Superior
Unit Award, four Army Good Conduct
Medals, the National Defense Service
Medal, the Global War on Terrorism
Service Medal, the NCO Professional
Development Ribbon with numeral
four, the Army Service Ribbon, two
Overseas Service Ribbons, the NATO
Medal, the Special Forces Tab, the
Combat Infantryman Badge, the Mili-
tary Free-fall Jumpmaster Badge, the
Master Parachutist Badge, the Chilean
Airborne Wings, and the Senior In-
structor Badge.
Sergeant Lindsay’s record is a testa-
ment to his commitment of putting
country before self, as he did in the
Army for nearly 15 years.
I stand before the House of Rep-
resentatives with a heavy heart think-
ing about his family and their great
loss, especially his wife, Sarah, his four
daughters, and his parents, Grant and
Tammy. I join the town of Cortez, his
brothers and sisters in arms, and the
entire Nation in mourning his un-
timely death. I have gotten to know
Sergeant Lindsay’s family over the
years and his loss will be felt by many
in our small community.
Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Lindsay’s
death is a painful reminder of the sac-
rifices our men and women in the mili-
tary endure, as well as their families.

H4438 June 12, 2019
Sergeant Lindsay was a true American
hero, from one of the most rural areas
of Colorado, who died protecting his
men and the country he loved.
He dedicated his life to selflessly pro-
tect our great Nation, and we are all
proud of him. His loss is tragic, but his
legacy will be remembered for genera-
tions to come, and the world is a better
place because of him.

RELEASE MICHAEL NGUYEN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. CORREA) for 5 minutes.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to address this body and demand
the release of one of our constituents,
Michael Nguyen, a law-abiding Amer-
ican citizen with no criminal record in
the United States.
He was arrested almost a year ago in
Vietnam while visiting his elderly rel-
atives. He has been held in detention
for almost a year.
This unjust imprisonment is due, es-
sentially, to one act, which is his ex-
pression of freedom of speech. He has
experienced extreme hardship, both
mentally and physically, while in pris-
on.
It is unacceptable that an American
citizen is detained in Vietnam for al-
most a year for nothing else than ex-
pressing his freedom of speech. The So-
cialist Republic of Vietnam has not
provided us with any evidence of
wrongdoing that would justify such an
arrest. The government has, instead,
confirmed that he is being charged
with violating article 109 of Vietnam’s
penal code, which is essentially a
catch-all.
What is his crime again? His freedom
of speech, expressing his opposition to
government policy.
Mr. Speaker, I ask the Government
of Vietnam to release this American
citizen. They are charging him with
nothing more than expressing his free-
dom of speech.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, PATRICK J.
SOLANO
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, this past
week, we as a nation honored the he-
roes of D-day.
Today, I rise to pay tribute, for the
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, to the Honor-
able Patrick J. Solano as he nears his
94th birthday.
Pat Solano is a legend in Pennsyl-
vania. In World War II, Pat flew 23
bombing missions over Berlin and was
decorated for his service.
Since returning home from the war,
Pat has been most instrumental in
building Pennsylvania and in creating
opportunities for so many. And Pat
mastered—perhaps, originated—and
continues to practice and preach the
politics of inclusion.
Pat was an official adviser to nine
Pennsylvania Governors and continues
to serve as a senior adviser to his cher-
ished Pennsylvania State Senate.
Pat’s smart, beautiful, kind wife of 65
years, Marie, is equally outstanding
and beloved; and they have six daugh-
ters and 11 grandchildren. Not a better
friend or mentor could we ask for in
our State or our community.
Mr. Speaker, I simply ask that we
wish Pat Solano a very happy birthday
and many more, and that we thank
him for his great service to our coun-
try.

PULSE NIGHTCLUB ANNIVERSARY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK) for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr.
Speaker, 3 years ago, tragedy struck
Orlando, Florida, at the Pulse night-
club.
Over 100 people celebrating life with
friends, partners, and family were
gunned down on a dance floor at a gay
club; 49 of them lost their lives.
A place of refuge was transformed
into a death trap by a hateful and cow-
ardly act, and today we can honor
those lives by calling for action.
At the time, the Pulse nightclub was
the deadliest mass shooting in modern
U.S. history. Tragically, in the 3 years
since this shooting, we have witnessed
more senseless suffering and death:
Parishioners in Texas and South
Carolina and worshippers in Pennsyl-
vania;
Students in Santa Fe and Parkland;
Municipal workers in Virginia Beach;
Neighbors on sidewalks and parks;
Over 50 people shot in just one week-
end in Chicago 2 weeks ago;
And then 58 concert goers in Las
Vegas lost their lives, taking the griz-
zly title of the deadliest mass shooting.
Days after the Pulse shooting, I
joined with my colleague, the iconic
Congressman JOHN LEWIS, in leading a
sit-in right here on this very floor. We
could not stand for another day of in-
action. We stopped Congress because
Congress had stopped working for the
American people.
Now, 3 years later, within months of
taking the majority, we have passed
two gun safety bills. And while I am
encouraged and proud of the work we
have done here in the House, we see the
same obstructionist game being played
out in the Senate. The two bills are
stalled, and Americans continue to die.
Mr. Speaker, 40,000 people a year die
from gun violence in our country.
Every day, 100 Americans are killed
with guns, and hundreds more are shot
and injured.
Gun violence and mass shootings
have gone from a rare event to a public
health crisis. Just this week, Massa-
chusetts General Hospital opened a
Gun Violence Prevention Center to
teach doctors how to deal with firearm
safety in recognition of the public
health risk that gun violence has be-
come to Americans.
Mr. Speaker, today I come before you
standing and not sitting, but still im-
ploring with the Senate to take a vote:
Perform your basic responsibilities not
as Members of Congress but, also, as
members of our communities.
We cannot waste another day. Mil-
lions of Americans at home are worried
for their families, frustrated by our in-
action, and scared that they or anyone
they love could be next.
We have a simple message on this
grim anniversary for the Senate: Stop
the silence. Pass commonsense gun vio-
lence prevention measures. Pass the
Equality Act, and do your job for the
people.

CHARLES A. CONKLIN AMERICAN
LEGION POST 28 CELEBRATES 100
YEARS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA) for 5 minutes.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in celebration of the first 100
years of the Charles A. Conklin Amer-
ican Legion Post 28 in Grand Haven,
Michigan.
But before I talk more extensively
about Post 28, I do want to acknowl-
edge this past week that very auspi-
cious ceremony and anniversary that
was recognized—D-Day.
I joined the bipartisan group, led by
the Speaker of the House and the mi-
nority leader, to the beaches of Nor-
mandy. To talk with those family
members, those veterans who served
there on those beaches was an incred-
ibly moving thing, especially for me,
the son of a disabled World War II vet-
eran who nearly perished in a B–24
crash in southern Italy, and to just rec-
ognize and remember the sacrifices
that not only those men that stormed
the beaches, but their families, endured
in the years after that.
I want to just highlight some of the
connections that we have had in west
Michigan to those efforts. Whether it
was the city of Grand Haven, which is
where Post 28 lies, which, upon the
sinking of a merchant marine ship, the
Coast Guard cutter Escanaba, raised
public funds locally to literally build
another Escanaba ship, one that has
continued that very special tie with
Grand Haven and with those members
of VFW Post 28; the Silversides, a sub-
marine that saw action in the South
Pacific; the LST that resides in Mus-
kegon, that took 31 trips back and
forth during that D-Day invasion over
those days, that history that we have
is rich.
And the history that Post 28 has is a
history that comes out of World War I,
something that we had just celebrated
the armistice of last November, the
100-year anniversary. My namesake,
Bill Huizenga, had the privilege of
fighting in that conflict and in that
war as well.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4439
June 12, 2019
I have, in my mind, this connection
that all of those men at that time over
100 years ago, that they were coming
together as a community, and they
were going off to fight for their coun-
try. And for 100 years now, this par-
ticular American Legion Post 28 had
selflessly, admirably, and honorably
served the Grand Haven community
with a special focus on veterans and
their families.
On June 12, 1919, how this came about
was 35 local veterans returning from
this Great War gathered at the Grand
Haven Armory and signed a petition to
become chartered as the Grand Haven
American Legion Post 28.
They chose as their namesake,
Charles A. Conklin, who was Grand Ha-
ven’s first fallen soldier of that war to
end all wars. Well, shortly after grad-
uating high school, Charles joined the
National Guard as a machine gunner
and was part of the prestigious 42nd
‘‘Rainbow’’ Division.
After ferocious fighting on the front
line, Charles was wounded in combat
and died on May 7, 1918. He now rests in
peace at Grand Haven’s Lake Forest
Cemetery, where his courageous spirit
continues to inspire local veterans and
all of our citizens to carry on his leg-
acy of duty, service, and valor.
After witnessing the positive impacts
across west Michigan, more veterans
and their families wanted to join Post
28. The Post 28 family first expanded
April 9, 1920, when the Women’s Auxil-
iary Unit 28 organized and was char-
tered; and then, for over a century, as
they continued to grow, the Sons of the
American Legion Squadron 28 was
chartered in 1937 and again in 1990. Fi-
nally, the American Legion Squadron
28 was organized in 2007, completing
the Post 28 family.
The American Legion Post 28’s stead-
fast commitment to serving veterans,
their families, and the Grand Haven
community shines in every act of serv-
ice that they perform. The long list of
charitable and educational programs,
including the annual Poppy Sale, the
Boys State and Girls State programs
that they support, the Good Fellows
Committee for volunteerism, the food
drives, and their famous Salmon Din-
ner Night at Grand Haven’s annual
Salmon Festival—not to mention the
thousands of diners that they serve at
the post’s home on Harbor Drive in
Grand Haven—really has underscored
their commitment to the community.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Second
District of Michigan, we thank the
members of the Charles A. Conklin
American Legion Post 28 in Grand
Haven for their service to our commu-
nity over the past century, and I look
forward to working with them in the
years to come.

FAIR TREATMENT FOR MICHAEL
NGUYEN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. LOWENTHAL) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today with my colleagues, espe-
cially led by Representative KATIE
PORTER in support of her constituent
Michael Nguyen.
I have stayed involved in this case
for just about a year, just slightly less
than a year, and I want to thank Rep-
resentative PORTER for keeping the
Members of Congress involved in this
by having periodic, almost monthly,
calls with the U.S. Consul office in
Vietnam.
I want to thank Ambassador
Kritenbrink for making this a high pri-
ority of the U.S. mission in Vietnam to
attend to the case of Michael, to visit
Michael Nguyen in jail.
And what am I talking about?
Michael Nguyen, who was a citizen of
the city of Orange, was on a trip in
July of 2018, as he frequently did dur-
ing the past, to visit relatives in Viet-
nam. On his way from the city of Da
Nang to Ho Chi Minh City, or what was
known as Saigon, government security
officials removed him from his bus and
took him into custody. He was de-
tained; he was imprisoned, repeatedly
interrogated; and when the U.S. Consul
and Members of Congress asked why he
was being charged, they were told, al-
most a year ago: He is under investiga-
tion. When we complete the investiga-
tion, we will tell you what the charge
is.
Michael’s family was not notified
about his detention, even for 10 days
after he was arrested. This violated the
agreement between the United States
and Vietnam, which said that the Viet-
namese Government must notify the
United States and our consul within 96
hours whenever there is an arrest of an
American citizen.
When he did not return home, Mi-
chael’s family began to contact U.S.
Representatives, including myself from
Orange County, asking for help, but we
learned very little in this past year
about why Michael was arrested and
detained.
Some thought that the Vietnamese
Government said that he had posted
something on Facebook about a plot to
overthrow the government, but they
have not provided any evidence or any
proof of this posting, just what has
been said.
As was pointed out earlier, he was ar-
rested for violating article 109 of the
Vietnamese penal code, which accuses
people of conspiring to overthrow the
government. The penalty for just post-
ing is from 14 years to life imprison-
ment.
While he has received the indict-
ment—he knows exactly why he is
being charged, what the issues are—
neither his family, the U.S. mission in
Vietnam, or Members of Congress who
have talked about this over the past
year have been told what are the spe-
cifics of the case or what he has done.
He hasn’t had contact with his fam-
ily while he is in jail. He doesn’t have
an attorney; he is not allowed to have
an attorney; and most likely, later this
month, just before the case comes to
court, he will be assigned an attorney.
His wife works for UC Irvine Medical
Center. They have four young children.
They don’t know what is going on.
It is just another example of the
egregious actions by the Government
of Vietnam.
I call upon the Government of Viet-
nam to close this case; return Michael
to his family. No American citizen
should be charged because they pub-
licly criticize a government or fear
that, when they visit Vietnam, espe-
cially because of speaking out in the
past, they are going to be arrested, de-
tained, and tried.
Mr. Speaker, it is time for the Mem-
bers of Congress to have a serious re-
evaluation of our economic and diplo-
matic relationships with Vietnam.
Vietnam should know that the U.S.
Congress is watching its actions and we
expect Michael Nguyen to be freed and
returned to his family.

JAYSON STARK AWARDED J.G.
TAYLOR SPINK AWARD
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5
minutes.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize an outstanding
citizen from Bucks County, Pennsyl-
vania, who will be recognized for excel-
lence in his field next month.
Jayson Stark of Newtown was an-
nounced as the winner of the Baseball
Writers’ Association of America’s J.G.
Taylor Spink Award for his work as a
baseball sports writer.
In July, Jayson will travel to Coop-
erstown, New York, for ‘‘meritorious
contributions to baseball writing’’ dur-
ing the National Baseball Hall of Fame
and Museum’s induction weekend.
A native of Philadelphia and a grad-
uate of Syracuse University, Jayson
began his career with the Providence
Journal before joining the Philadelphia
Inquirer in 1979. He later joined ESPN
and now covers baseball for The Ath-
letic. Jayson credits his love of writing
to his mother, June Stark, who was
also a writer.
We congratulate him on this major
achievement and his contributions to
sports writing.
I send my best wishes to Jayson, his
wife, Lisa, and their three children as
well.

RECOGNIZING FATIMA COMMUNITY GARDEN
PROJECT
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize a project in
Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that is
promoting sustainability for members
of our community.
Over the past year, 44 immigrant
communities worked tirelessly to cre-
ate the Fatima Community Garden
Project located behind Our Lady of
Fatima in Bensalem, Pennsylvania.

H4440 June 12, 2019
The garden serves as a collaborative ef-
fort between the Pennsylvania Horti-
cultural Society and Catholic Social
Services.
For many immigrants who arrive in
our community, the Fatima Commu-
nity Garden Project gives newcomers
the ability to use horticultural skills
cultivated in their homelands while of-
fering them the opportunity to con-
verse with local residents. One neigh-
bor referred to the Fatima Community
Garden Project as a sanctuary.
Mr. Speaker, the Fatima Community
Garden Project officially opens on Sat-
urday, and I would like to thank sev-
eral people who have worked over the
past year to make this unique collabo-
ration successful: J. Mizael Chavez, a
community leader who helped families
establish their presence in Bensalem;
Matt Rader, president of the Pennsyl-
vania Horticultural Society; and Estela
Bugg of Catholic Social Services for all
of their work.
HONORING PDC MACHINES
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize a second-gen-
eration, family-owned business in
Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that was
recognized last month for the out-
standing work that they do to support
our local economy.
PDC Machines, Inc., an equipment
manufacturer based in Warminster,
Pennsylvania, was honored at the 2019
President’s E Award ceremony. They
were presented with an award by Com-
merce Secretary Wilbur Ross for their
work supporting the expansion of U.S.
exports.
Founded in 1977, PDC has been ex-
porting products since the early 1980s.
Today, approximately 50 percent of
PDC’s revenues come from inter-
national business.
PDC Machines takes great pride in
the quality of their products and the
services they provide to their cus-
tomers. I am proud to have such a dy-
namic and innovative company in our
community in Bucks County.
We congratulate the Afzal family for
this well-deserved recognition.
f
GIVE MICHAEL NGUYEN FAIR
TREATMENT IN VIETNAM
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. PORTER) for 5 minutes.
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today on behalf of Mr. Michael Nguyen,
an American citizen and resident of my
home district, California’s 45th Con-
gressional District.
Mr. Nguyen left Vietnam in 1975, 44
years ago. The Vietnamese Govern-
ment arrested Michael last summer, al-
most a year ago, while he was traveling
and visiting elderly relatives. Michael
has now been detained in Vietnam for
over 11 months.
We still don’t know what crime he is
alleged to have committed or what, if
any, evidence the Vietnamese Govern-
ment has to justify his detention and
his upcoming trial.
My office has asked repeatedly for
this information, but we have been told
that we won’t know these basics until
Michael is taken to court later this
month. His family won’t know these
basics until then.
To make matters worse, for the vast
majority of these past 11 months, Mi-
chael was being detained without for-
mal charges at all. We now know that
Michael is being charged for allegedly
violating article 109 of the Vietnamese
Criminal Code, activities against the
government. This is a charge that Viet-
namese officials have used in the past
for arbitrary arrests.
By all accounts, Michael is a good
man. He was an active member of his
community and church in Orange
County. I have met his family numer-
ous times, and his wife, Helen, was my
guest for the State of the Union.
He has four beautiful daughters, all
school age, who miss their father very
much. He is a dad who makes breakfast
for his girls in the morning and was
their primary caretaker.
He was a small business owner, and
he is an American citizen with no
criminal record here in the United
States.
He hasn’t been able to speak to his
family during this entire time, nearly 1
year. Instead, the Vietnamese Govern-
ment permits only monthly visits by
the U.S. State Department. I thank our
State Department officials for visiting
him, enabling him to hear messages
from his loved ones, and working to en-
sure his health during this long deten-
tion.
But that isn’t enough. His family is
suffering. Michael’s wife, Helen, has
taken on a second job while acting as a
single mom to their four young girls.
His daughters have trouble sleeping
and focusing at school.
This entire situation is unjust. Mi-
chael was held without formal charges
for over 9 months, and we still have
been presented with no evidence. That
is not how an American citizen should
be treated abroad. We expect our part-
ners to show respect for human rights
and the rule of law.
I am grateful that so many of my col-
leagues, Republicans and Democrats,
continue to join me in calling on the
Vietnamese Government to do what is
right. This is not a partisan issue.
Respectfully, I demand that the Viet-
namese Government provide Michael
with a fair resolution to his case and
return him safely to the U.S. and to his
family as soon as possible.
I will continue to work to secure Mi-
chael’s release until he is reunited with
his family and brought home to his
country, the United States of America.
f
STAND UP FOR SUDANESE
PEOPLE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Michigan (Mr. KILDEE) for 5 minutes.
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, last year,
I had the opportunity to visit Sudan
and hear from the Sudanese people. I
saw firsthand the devastating toll that
the Sudanese regime has taken on the
country of Sudan and its citizens.
Sadly, today, the hardship and vio-
lence have escalated after months of
peaceful protests by the brave Suda-
nese people.
Sudan’s longtime leader, President
Omar al-Bashir, was removed from
power. Since then, the Transitional
Military Council has attacked pro-
testers who are peacefully calling for a
transition to democratic governance.
The news we continue to see from
Sudan over the past few weeks has
been nothing short of heart-wrenching
as peaceful protesters have been at-
tacked, threatened, and killed.
Congress cannot sit idly by while this
regime kills its own citizens, blocks
communication to the outside world,
and continues to commit serious
human rights abuses.
Congress must do everything we can
to help end this conflict. We are mor-
ally obligated to use this platform to
call attention to what is happening
there and to say with a unified voice
that the Sudanese Government’s treat-
ment of its people is completely unac-
ceptable.
For these reasons, I have introduced
a bipartisan resolution this week call-
ing attention to the situation in
Sudan. I am honored that the chairman
of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr.
ENGEL, joined two other leaders on this
issue, Representative MCGOVERN and
Representative BILIRAKIS, in sup-
porting this legislation as original co-
sponsors.
I ask my colleagues to all join as co-
sponsors for this important resolution,
a resolution that affirms that it is Con-
gress’ position that the Transitional
Military Council must immediately
stop all violence against peaceful pro-
testers and begin to immediately tran-
sition governance to a democratic and
civilian-led body.
The Sudanese people have the right
to freedom from oppression and vio-
lence and to live in a country where
they can choose their own leaders
without fear of persecution, without
fear of violence, and without fear of
being killed for simply asserting their
right to self-determination, as all
human beings ought to be allowed.
Simply, the ability to peacefully as-
semble and have one’s voice heard is a
basic human right. It should be af-
forded to all people, including all citi-
zens of Sudan.
This resolution also makes it clear
that Sudan must improve dramatically
if it wants to continue a productive en-
gagement with the United States of
America, including political reform
and respect for basic human rights.
This resolution affirms the right of
Sudanese people to assemble peacefully
and condemns the government’s use of
violence against protesters and jour-
nalists. We emphasize that absent po-
litical reforms and respect for human
rights, it will be impossible for the U.S.
to engage Sudan as a partner.

that we have our voices heard, that we
stand up for people whose voices are
being silenced by violence. We have a
chance to speak in a clear voice and
send a message that the United States
and its government will support the
people of Sudan.
Sudan must do better because we and
the world are watching. Sudan cannot
be allowed to go down this dangerous
path.
We have to stand with the people of
Sudan, stand for their democratic
rights, allow their voices to be heard,
and allow them to live in freedom.

REMEMBERING THOSE LOST IN
PULSE NIGHTCLUB MASS SHOOT-
ING
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Florida (Mrs. MURPHY) for 5 minutes.
Mrs. MURPHY. Mr. Speaker, today
marks 3 years since the terrible trag-
edy that took the lives of 49 people at
the Pulse nightclub in Orlando.
That is 36 months, 156 weeks, 1,095
days that the victims’ families and
loved ones have had to live without
their presence and without their light.
This single incident shook our com-
munity to its core and forever changed
us. But our city showed that we are a
vibrant community that prides itself
on its love and inclusion.
Following the tragedy, hundreds
came out to donate blood and help
their fellow brothers and sisters in
their time of need. The site was trans-
formed into a makeshift memorial, one
that was full of love, thoughtful notes,
and flowers.
This was the largest attack against
LGBTQ people in U.S. history. As we
celebrate Pride Month, we must honor
their memories, be inspired by their
legacies, and recognize the positive
contributions the LGBTQ community
offers to the world.
While those memories may be raw
and remembering those we lost may
still hurt, we cannot forget that the
love that the 49 victims brought into
this world will always be stronger than
the hate that stole their lives on that
day.
Hate will never win. Love always
will.
The memories of those who lost their
lives will never ever been forgotten.

Chamber of worldly power, we humbly
acknowledge that the dome of this Cap-

You continue to rule in truth and jus-

We are grateful for the many gifts of
Your providence that You shower down

humbly acknowledge that all our ac-

ereign omniscience. ‘‘For there is noth-
ing hidden that will not become visible
and nothing secret that will not be
known and come to light.’’ Therefore,
we invoke this day Your blessing upon
those who labor beneath this dome and
who have been entrusted with the sa-
cred duty of governing our Nation.
Banish from our hearts all tempta-
tions to greed and envy. Move our
hearts to the virtues that will bring
lasting happiness. Keep us steadfast in
the pursuit of the common good. Make
us ever mindful of the shortness of our
days and make us always desirous of
standing before You with integrity. In-
voking Your mercy upon our failings
and Your grace upon the work of our
hands, we ask this through Christ our
Lord.
Amen.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without

Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I
rise to welcome a very special guest to
our Nation’s Capitol, Father David
Carter of the Basilica of Sts. Peter and
Paul in Chattanooga, and the Rist fam-
ily.
Father David Carter is a man of
strong faith and principled leadership.
In our east Tennessee community, he
serves as the vice chancellor for the Di-
ocese of Knoxville and was the chaplain
at Knoxville Catholic High School
until his tenure as the rector of the ba-
silica began in 2013.
Father Carter also enjoys the beauty
that God has bestowed on the Volun-
teer State, leading treks in the Great
Smoky Mountains. But even outside
the House of God, he continues to show
his faith, serving as chaplain to the
parish’s Trail Life troop.
In my service to east Tennessee in
this Chamber, I often seek guidance
from the Lord’s word, and I am thank-
ful to have Father Carter as my priest.
I pray that our Nation knows more Fa-
ther Carters, those who seek to serve
and find Christ as the source of truth.
I hope that Father Carter and his
guests enjoy their time in this beau-
tiful city.

Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, 3 years

She woke up to a flurry of text mes-
sages from her son. He was trapped in
a nightclub bathroom at the mercy of a
man with an MCX rifle and a death
wish. His first text: ‘‘Mommy, I love
you’’; then at 2:39 a.m.: ‘‘He’s coming.
I’m gonna to die.’’ Eddie Justice was
murdered in the Pulse nightclub that
morning, and he was 30 years old.
Today we stand with Eddie’s family
and loved ones. We stand with Orlando.
We stand with the LGBTQ community.
And we stand up here to say doing
nothing to prevent mass shootings in
our country is a dereliction of our

H4442 June 12, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, this Friday is Flag Day
and the U.S. Army’s 244th birthday.
Each year, on June 14, we celebrate
the Stars and Stripes, which the Sec-
ond Continental Congress designated as
the symbol of our Nation on June 14,
1777.
Since our founding, our flag has
flown across the country and the world.
It has flown during both our most trag-
ic moments and our greatest triumphs.
It has also been a glorious symbol of
hope for our brave servicemen and
-women who salute it, defend it, serve
it, and, in some cases, die for it to pro-
tect our freedom and liberty.
Later today, the Secretary of the
Army, the Chief of Staff of the Army,
and the Sergeant Major of the Army
will be on Capitol Hill to celebrate the
rich history of our Army.
Without the Army 244 years ago, we
would not be the great Nation that we
are today. On Friday, our Nation will
celebrate our Army and our flag, which
both symbolize America being the land
of the free and the home of the brave.

HONORING CHRISTOPHER J.
MORGAN
(Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute
and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of
New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to
honor a young hero we lost last week
who died in a tragic accident at the
United States Military Academy at
West Point, located in my district in
New York’s Hudson Valley.
The cadet’s name was Christopher J.
Morgan, but most folks called him C.J.
He was a member of the class of 2020.
He was just 22 years old.
Chris was a talented cadet. He was
majoring in law and legal studies and
was a standout wrestler. Above all, he
was dedicated to this country and to
protecting our freedoms.
The loss of a young cadet is heart-
breaking, and this accident is dev-
astating to our community. This trag-
edy is another painful reminder of the
sacrifices our military servicemembers
and their families make for us and on
our behalf.
My heart goes out to Chris’ family,
to his fellow cadets, some of whom
were also injured in the accident, and I
ask today that all join me in praying
for these cadets and the soldiers in-
jured last week in the accident. The
Army family is impacted and the en-
tire West Point community.
I also want to thank New York’s first
responders, medics, emergency per-
sonnel, and State troopers for their
quick action after the accident last
week.

CONGRATULATING MATTHEW
CHAIRES
(Mr. RUTHERFORD asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to congratulate Second
Lieutenant Matthew Chaires on his
graduation from the United States
Military Academy at West Point.
Lieutenant Chaires, or Gunner, as his
family and friends call him, is from
Hilliard, a small town in northeast
Florida with a population of just over
3,000.
At Hilliard Middle-Senior High
School, he was a student athlete and
all-State football player, and he re-
ceived numerous athletic and academic
honors. In fact, Lieutenant Chaires is
the only Hilliard resident to ever at-
tend and graduate from one of our Na-
tion’s prestigious service academies.
At West Point, he was assigned to
Bravo Company B2 Bulldogs in the sec-
ond regiment and was a member of the
cannon crew for the Black Knights dur-
ing football season. With his time at
West Point complete, he now heads to
Fort Sill, Oklahoma, to begin field ar-
tillery training.
On behalf of the Hilliard community
and all of northeast Florida, thank you
to Lieutenant Chaires for his commit-
ment to both service and academic ex-
cellence. We are all very proud of him.

GUN VIOLENCE
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
on the anniversary of the Pulse night-
club tragedy to remember those who
lost their lives on that horrific night.
It should not be lost that this hap-
pened at an LGBTQ nightclub during
Latino night and that those who lost
their lives were mostly our Brown and
Black neighbors.
Just this weekend, I joined commu-
nity members, advocates, and local
elected officials to demand action on
gun violence in our country. Hundreds
of us gathered for this rally across the
street from where organizers were get-
ting ready to open Motor City Pride,
Detroit’s Pride celebration attracting
tens of thousands of people wanting to
celebrate the community and recom-
mit to the fight for justice for our
LGBTQ neighbors.
A few hours after the gun violence
rally wrapped up and Motor City Pride
opened, armed neo-Nazis right outside
of the gates of the festival taunted at-
tendants, creating an unsafe environ-
ment for all of us.
I bring this up because the fight
against gun violence is intersectional.
The fight against hate is inter-
sectional.
Let us remember those who have
been lost to gun violence. Let us re-
member those at Pulse. Remember
those at Stonewall Douglas.
I commend our people who have
taken action out of the tragedy that
shouldn’t have happened at all. It is
time for us elected officials in this
Chamber to do what we can to stop gun
violence and hate in this country.
f
HONORING BRUCE BURNHAM
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor Mr. Bruce Burnham, a
retired member of the military police
who served in the Vietnam war and was
awarded the Bronze Star.
After retiring from the military, Mr.
Burnham began teaching at Armwood
High School, where he taught history,
social studies, and classes on the Viet-
nam war for 30 years.
Known affectionately as the mayor of
Armwood, Mr. Burnham continues to
dedicate his retirement to the stu-
dents. He serves as the announcer for
the Armwood varsity football team and
continues to give speeches to high
school students on the Vietnam war.
Mr. Burnham was placed on the front
lines of history, and he has spent the
last 30 years retelling that history to
his students.
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Burnham clearly
has the love of our community. He also
has the respect of our country.
f
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 962,
BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SUR-
VIVORS PROTECTION ACT
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that the Committee on
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 962, the
Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protec-
tion Act, which is necessary to save
the innocent lives of innocent children,
and ask for its immediate consider-
ation in the House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
GARCÍA of Illinois). Under guidelines
consistently issued by successive
Speakers, as recorded in section 956 of
the House Rules and Manual, the Chair
is constrained not to entertain the re-
quest unless it has been cleared by the
bipartisan floor and committee leader-
ships.
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, if this
unanimous consent request can’t be en-
tertained, I urge the Speaker to—
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has not been recognized for de-
bate.

COMMENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF
ROCHESTER MEDICAL CENTER
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to commend the University of
Rochester Medical Center, which has
just been awarded a $3.75 million grant
for their Geriatric Workforce Enhance-
ment Program.
VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:46 Jun 13, 2019 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K12JN7.015 H12JNPT1
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4443
June 12, 2019
This significant award recognizes
their world-class medical and edu-
cational expertise, while helping to ce-
ment their position as a leader in the
geriatrics field.
Investments like this are essential to
strengthening health outcomes and en-
suring a high quality of life for our
loved ones as they age. The grant will
support the Finger Lakes Geriatric
Education Center, helping to fund spe-
cific education and training for Alz-
heimer’s disease and related demen-
tias. It will support the broader goal of
creating a comprehensive age-friendly
health system and work toward mak-
ing Rochester and the Finger Lakes re-
gion a dementia-friendly community.
I am so grateful to the University of
Rochester for their continued dedica-
tion and commitment to supporting
the needs of older adults. I congratu-
late them on receiving this exciting
grant award and look forward to con-
tinuing our work together to provide
high-quality care to everyone who calls
our community home.
f
CRISIS AT THE BORDER
(Mr. ROY asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I am here be-
fore a relatively empty Chamber, as is
too often the case in the people’s
House, as I want to raise to the atten-
tion of the American people the abso-
lute crisis and tragedy that is occur-
ring on the southern border of the
United States. It is unconscionable
what we are allowing to occur.
As we speak today, a little girl and
her mom will be abused on the journey
through Mexico while this country, the
most powerful nation in the history of
the world, buries its head in the sand
because my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle, in a cynical political
gesture and move, refuse to actually
take up the supplemental request from
the President of the United States for
$41⁄2 billion to provide the beds and the
resources necessary to deal with the
crisis, and to start taking up the bills
that we should take up to ensure we fix
the asylum crisis that cartels are using
for profit, and to fix the catch-and-re-
lease broken system that is allowing
our system to be overrun, allowing
communities in Texas to be overrun.
This is a tragedy, and it is uncon-
scionable that this body will not ad-
dress it.

IN RECOGNITION OF WOMEN’S
VETERANS DAY
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, on
June 12, 1948, President Harry S. Tru-
man signed into law the Women’s
Armed Services Integration Act, allow-
ing women to serve as regular members
of the military.
In the State of Texas, a bill was sent
in to establish Women’s Veterans Day,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4444 June 12, 2019
and that bill, in the Senate, was signed
into law by the Governor of the State
of Texas.
I am honored to represent over
170,000 distinguished women veterans
in the State of Texas. Moreover, I am
proud to work alongside the four
women veterans serving in the 116th
Congress, and many more.
On this day, it is imperative that we
highlight women’s role in the United
States military. There should be no se-
cret that women play an integral part.
They volunteer for the same reasons
as men, but 4.3 percent of women in the
military reported being sexually as-
saulted. Female veterans are three to
four times more likely than their civil-
ian counterparts to become homeless
and 2.5 times more likely to commit
suicide.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. LaShondra
Jones for bringing to our attention
honoring women veterans today, and
they will be taking part in many dif-
ferent activities. I am in awe of their
invaluable service.
I want to salute them today on the
floor of the United States House of
Representatives. This is a wonderful
day that we are celebrating Women’s
Veterans Day in Texas, but we should
celebrate it and honor it in the United
States of America.

CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN
BORDER
(Mr. BIGGS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, there is a
lot I could say, but I want to point out
a couple of things.
Right now, the Border Patrol has de-
tention facilities that are designed to
hold 4,000 people but are holding 19,000
people. ICE has facilities to hold 45,000
people, but it is holding 52,000 people.
We are releasing people regularly
into communities and throughout this
country. Mr. Speaker, ICE alone has
released over 200,000 family units into
the country this year.
In Yuma, Arizona, a facility designed
for 250 people is currently housing 1,100
people.
It is going to be 110 degrees tomor-
row. Most of those people are being
held outside under awnings with a
large swamp cooler to cool them. That
will work okay. It will be livable. It
will be uncomfortable, but livable. But
in about 3 or 4 weeks, when it is 115, 120
degrees and the humidity is out of this
world, those swamp coolers will not
work.
Mr. Speaker, I am asking and going
to make a motion to adjourn because
our colleagues refuse to bring a supple-
ment that would pay for humanitarian
and detention facilities.

June 12, 2019
CONTINUE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR
ALZHEIMER’S RESEARCH
(Mr. WOODALL asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to speak on a topic that I think
is important to everyone in this insti-
tution. As most of my colleagues know,
June is National Alzheimer’s and Brain
Awareness Month.
Mr. Speaker, if Members have been
fortunate enough that they have not
had a family member affected, then I
hope they remain fortunate in that
way because statistics suggest that
each and every one of us is going to
have a family member who is affected
by Alzheimer’s or brain health in one
way or another.
The bill we are voting on today is our
opportunity to fund that research. If
Members have been following Alz-
heimer’s research over the past 12
months, then they know it has been a
disappointing 12 months not because
we haven’t been funding it properly—
we have—and not because the research
has not been going on—it has—but be-
cause things we thought were so prom-
ising have turned out not to be so. We
are starting over again in a lot of dif-
ferent ways.
Mr. Speaker, if there is one thing I
believe the American people can count
on amidst all the partisan strife is the
way that we come together to fund
that fundamental health research that
only the Federal Government can
stand behind and succeed in.
I thank my colleagues on both sides
of the aisle for their support of those
accounts thus far. I hope that as we
continue this appropriations season,
that will continue as well.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-

Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, for the purpose of debate
only, I yield the customary 30 minutes
to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.
WOODALL), pending which I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. Dur-
ing consideration of this resolution, all
time yielded is for the purpose of de-

GENERAL LEAVE
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that
all Members may have 5 legislative
days in which to revise and extend
their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California?
There was no objection.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Com-
mittee met and reported the rule,
House Resolution 436, providing for
consideration of H.R. 2740, the Labor,
Health and Human Services, Edu-
cation, Defense, State, Foreign Oper-
ations, and Energy and Water Develop-
ment Appropriations Act, 2020.
The rule provides for further consid-
eration of H.R. 2740 under a structured
rule and makes in order 115 amend-
ments. The rule provides no further
general debate.
The chair of the Appropriations Com-
mittee may also offer amendments en
bloc consisting of amendments made in
order by the rule and not earlier dis-
posed of.
Finally, the rule includes one motion
to recommit.
Mr. Speaker, it was only a few
months ago that we were standing here
voting to end the longest government
shutdown in the history of the United
States, a shutdown that hurt so many
of our constituents, constituents like
David Pesko, an FAA air traffic con-
troller at Ontario Airport.
He was in escrow to purchase a home,
and, without a paycheck coming in, he
had to rely on his family and friends’
generosity in order to make ends meet.
We owe David and the American peo-
ple much more, and that is why I am
especially proud of the timely intro-
duction of these appropriations bills. It
exemplifies the hard work of my col-
leagues on the Appropriations Com-
mittee and this majority’s commit-
ment to good governance.
Mr. Speaker, in years past, we have
relied strongly on omnibus spending

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4446 June 12, 2019
bills to fund the government. But now,
with the hard work done by Members
on both sides of the aisle, this majority
is leading us in a return to regular
order.
As has often been said on this very
floor, the primary job of Congress is to
fund the American government and
keep it open and operating. Our con-
stituents deserve no less.
With this package under consider-
ation today, the House will do just that
with respect to 4 of the 12 spending
bills.
In passing this bill, we will provide
crucial funding for services across
broad areas of the government and ful-
fill our promises to the American peo-
ple. That funding includes historic in-
vestments in programs that provide op-
portunities for millions of people, in-
cluding my constituents in the Inland
Empire.
Perhaps more important than what is
included in this bill is what is not in-
cluded. This minibus rejects the Presi-
dent’s draconian budget cuts that
would have hurt every American, but
especially women and children.
Instead, we have won increased fund-
ing for a number of important prior-
ities.
This bill boosts biomedical research
at the National Institutes of Health,
expands opioid abuse treatment and
prevention programs, and launches new
initiatives for maternal and child
health.
I recently visited three health clinics
in my district that provide 30,000 fami-
lies with lifesaving care.
This bill provides $400 million for the
Title X Family Planning Program so
that everyone in the Inland Empire and
across America can continue to have
access to cancer screenings, STI tests,
reproductive care, and other lifesaving
services.
It also protects against the adminis-
tration’s policies that prevent a woman
from making choices about her future,
like when to have a child.
When women do decide to become
mothers, this bill supports them by in-
vesting in working families and our
children with $7.8 billion for the
Childcare and Development Block
Grant program.
Passing this bill will demonstrate
our commitment to the ideal that all
students deserve a quality, safe, and af-
fordable education, and that commit-
ment is realized in over $24 billion in
funding for Federal Student Aid pro-
grams, almost $2 billion more than the
President’s insufficient request.
Just as important is this bill’s ac-
knowledgement of how far we have to
go in helping underserved commu-
nities, the bill provides $917 million to
assist minority-serving institutions,
including $150 million for Hispanic-
serving institutions like Cal Poly Po-
mona, Cal State San Bernardino, and
UC Riverside, which prepare thousands
of students in my district to be tomor-
row’s leaders.
Mr. Speaker, I am also happy to re-
port that this legislation provides the
funding necessary for a 3.1 percent pay
raise for our servicemembers, who con-
tinue to serve our Nation around the
world.
As the mother of an Air Force vet-
eran, it is wonderful news to hear that
our servicemembers are being acknowl-
edged for the hard work that they do
keeping our Nation safe, at home and
abroad.
In addition to paying our service-
members more, this bill will protect
our men and women in uniform from
one of the most common harms that
they encounter: sexual assault.
The $38 million in additional funding
for DOD’S sexual assault prevention
and response programs will ensure that
survivors have representation while
navigating the complicated military
justice process, that they will not have
to wait years for a resolution—years,
Mr. Speaker—as one of my constitu-
ents had to do.
This bill not only invests in our pri-
orities at home; it advances our prior-
ities abroad. I am particularly pleased
with increased investments in certain
areas, including global reproductive
health and aid to Central American
countries.
This bill empowers countless women
who are the backbone of their families
around the world by increasing funding
for family planning programs, revers-
ing the President’s disastrous global
gag rule, and contributing $55.5 million
to the United Nations Population
Fund.
Robust funding is included for
counter-narcotics and law enforcement
efforts in Colombia, Mexico, Central
America, and the Caribbean.
This bill also ensures that the fund-
ing provided goes to the right people—
the right people, Mr. Speaker—instead
of the corrupt officials that undermine
democracy and misuse U.S. aid. This is
especially important given the recent
report regarding corruption in the
Northern Triangle countries of Guate-
mala and Honduras.
And, finally, the last part of this bill
that I would like to highlight is what
we are doing to invest in our energy
and water infrastructure.
The bill rejects the President’s short-
sighted proposed cuts to key energy
and water programs and, instead, in-
vests $46.6 billion to rebuild our crum-
bling infrastructure, build the next
generation of clean energy tech-
nologies, and combat the urgent threat
that is climate change.
This is a good bill. This is a bill that
should be signed into law, and I urge
my colleagues to vote for this rule so
that we can get back to regular order
and avoid another costly shutdown.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from
California for yielding me the time.
We finished up in the Rules Com-
mittee, I think, before 10 p.m. last
night. I was optimistic that we finished
up that early.
It is not the Members you need to
worry about, Mr. Speaker. It is the
staff of the Rules Committee you need
to worry about, because they had hun-
dreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of
amendments submitted that they were
going through all weekend long, trying
to sort out what are those amendments
that could be made in order, what are
those amendments that would need
waivers of the rules, what are those
amendments that could be considered
on the floor and not be repetitive.
It is an amazing burden on the staff
to have to go through all those amend-
ments, Mr. Speaker, and it is an unnec-
essary burden.
You weren’t here at the time, Mr.
Speaker, but I am looking right down
here below me at the gentleman from
Kentucky. He used to be the chairman
of the Appropriations Committee and
was the chairman of the Appropria-
tions Committee the last time we came
to the House floor under regular order,
as my friend from California suggests,
and we allowed every Member of this
institution—everyone who had been
elected by their constituents back
home, everyone who has a voting
card—to come and offer any idea that
they had to improve upon the under-
lying bill.
I don’t take issue with much of what
my friend from California said about
many of the good things in this bill.
There are many good things in this
bill.
But what I love about the Appropria-
tions Committee, Mr. Speaker, dif-
ferent from the Rules Committee, is
they come to the House year after year
and say we have done an amazing job
working together in a bipartisan way
in the Appropriations Committee, but
the other Members of the House who
don’t serve on that committee, if they
have some expertise that they think
can improve the bill, bring it on. Bring
it on. Let’s go down to that House
floor. Let’s have that festival of democ-
racy. Let’s test those ideas, and let’s
send the best product that we can to
the President’s desk.
b 1330
My friend from California says that
this is a good bill and that it should ab-
solutely be signed by the President.
She could be right. I would probably
disagree with her, Mr. Speaker, but she
could be right.
The fact of the matter is, the law of
the land, as it exists today, won’t let us
implement this bill. This bill spends
above those caps, the statutory spend-
ing caps passed by the Congress and
signed by the President.
This bill cannot become law at these
levels. If it were to, we would have an
automatic sequester that brings the
levels down.
That is a terrible way to govern. We
have learned that lesson over the past
10 years together.
Mr. Speaker, I wish I didn’t have to
point to the gentleman from Kentucky
and say remember the days when
VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:30 Jun 13, 2019 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K12JN7.026 H12JNPT1
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4447
June 12, 2019
everybody’s voice mattered in this in-
stitution. Remember those days. That
day should be today. It is not an easy
pathway to get back to.
I remember when we were trying to
do open rules on the Republican side.
My Democratic colleagues would come
to the floor and offer amendments that
they knew would pass with a minority
of Republican votes and a lot of Demo-
cratic votes. Then they would vote in
favor of that amendment to change the
bill, but they would vote against the
final bill, knowing it would not be able
to pass without their support.
That is a great strategy, and it has
been used by both sides, if my col-
leagues want to be in the business of
making a point. It is an awful strategy
if my colleagues want to be in the busi-
ness of making a difference. If Mem-
bers came to this institution to govern
instead of to get the next sound bite,
that is a terrible path to be on.
Mr. Speaker, if Members went
through those hundreds of amendments
the way that the Rules Committee
staff went through them over the
weekend, they would see good idea
after good idea after good idea that has
been turned away before it could be
considered on the floor of this House. I
don’t know whether those amendments
would have passed or failed. I know
some of them would have passed; I
know some of them would have failed.
There was a time in this institution
when we let the votes decide, when we
let the membership decide.
Mr. Speaker, we have changed those
rules. It is now 13 men and women who
sit on the Rules Committee who decide.
I value my friend from California’s
suggestion that we get back to regular
order, and I know it is not an easy path
to follow. This bill is the most open we
have had so far this year, and yet, it
still denies Member after Member, on
both sides of the aisle, an opportunity
to have their constituents’ voices
heard.
Mr. Speaker, we can do better. If we
speak with one voice in this body and
reject this rule, we will do better. All it
takes is the courage of our convictions
to do that.
I hope my Members will stand with
me in aspiring to do better today than
we did yesterday and better still to-
morrow.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
I would like to remind my colleague
that I also serve on the Appropriations
Committee, and we had a very open
and transparent process. Every sub-
committee invited all Members to
come before us to present their ideas or
their requests to the subcommittees of
the Appropriations Committee. We
have also supported 95 percent of the
written requests from all Members.
So to say that it was not transparent
and that Members did not have an op-
portunity to come before and present
their ideas is incorrect.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs.
WATSON COLEMAN).
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman
from California for giving me this op-
portunity to speak on what I think is a
very important and very good bill.
I am here to speak on H.R. 2740,
which contains the fiscal year 2020
Labor, Health and Human Services,
and Education; Defense; State and For-
eign Operations; and Energy and Water
Development funding bills.
As a new member of the Appropria-
tions Committee this year, I am par-
ticularly proud to support this bill,
which includes, among many other
things, $100 million in programming for
reentry programs; $250 million for reg-
istered apprenticeships; and $128 mil-
lion for Youth Build, a program that
provides critical skills to youth in my
district, which is New Jersey’s 12th
Congressional District.
I thank Chairwoman ROSA DELAURO
for her leadership of our subcommittee.
I was pleased to work with her to in-
clude language and funding that ad-
dresses maternal mortality, including
various provisions to address the per-
sistent gaps in our healthcare system
that result in Black mothers being 2 to
6 times more likely to die than White
moms.
I also thank her for working with me
to include funding to address the sui-
cide epidemic among our youth. This is
needed urgently, as the suicide rate for
children has increased 70 percent in the
last decade, with a disproportionate in-
crease among Black youth. To inform
further efforts to address this epi-
demic, the bill requests a report from
the Surgeon General on contributing
factors and evidence-based interven-
tions.
In closing, I urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘yes’’ on the rule and ‘‘yes’’ on
the underlying bill.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. STAUBER), a colleague of
mine on the bipartisan Transportation
and Infrastructure Committee.
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I find
myself in rule debate today because my
very reasonable amendment was not
made in order. The amendment was
germane to the bill, written with prop-
er offsets, and in accordance with
House rules. The denial of my amend-
ment was purely political.
I wanted to debate my amendment on
its merits because the passage of my
amendment would mean jobs for fami-
lies in Minnesota’s Eighth Congres-
sional District.
In northern Minnesota, there are
vast reserves of copper, nickel, and
other precious metals, offering the op-
portunity for northern Minnesota to
power our economy while providing
high-wage union jobs and diminishing
our reliance on foreign resources.
The Twin Metals project has a long
and difficult regulatory review ahead
because our approval processes are the
strongest in the world. Twin Metals is
following the process. We require that
they cross every ‘‘t’’ and dot every ‘‘i,’’
and they will employ our friends and
neighbors in good mining jobs of the
future.
Unfortunately, politicians in Wash-
ington and the Twin Cities metro area
oppose this project. They know that we
have the strongest environmental re-
views in the world, and they know
Twin Metals will have the opportunity
to succeed, so they decided to change
the rules.
They included language in this
spending bill creating a ‘‘study’’ that
does nothing more than delay this
project. It is changing the rules when
they know a project has a great chance
to be successful.
Instead of including it in the base
bill, they snuck it into committee re-
port language. Instead of making my
amendment in order, they decided to
reject it, all because they want to
interfere with a promising project in
Minnesota District Eight.
Twin Metals will offer a mine plan of
operation in the coming months. In
that mine plan, they will lay out how
they will extract our minerals and
store tailings in an environmentally
sound way. They will illustrate how
they plan to meet or exceed all existing
standards.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Minnesota.
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, this is
unacceptable. I want to debate the
merits of my amendment by discussing
how this will follow the rules and ben-
efit jobs in my district. Instead, I am
here to discuss the failed process and
how antimining groups changed the
rules to benefit their antimining ide-
ology.
Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule, and I
urge my colleagues to do so as well.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Florida (Ms. FRANKEL).
Ms. FRANKEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank
my colleagues for their work on this
bill.
I am very proud to support this rule
for this very outstanding bill package
that makes For the People investments
to give every person a better chance for
a better life.
Mr. Speaker, I want to touch on a few
issues.
First, with this legislation, we recog-
nize that when women succeed, Amer-
ica and the world succeed. We do this
with many, many outstanding invest-
ments.
When women in our country and the
world are educated and healthy and
have economic opportunity, their com-
munities will be more prosperous and
peaceful for everyone.
We have increased investments in
Head Start and childcare programs,
medical research, family planning,
girls’ education, fighting gender-based

violence, and supporting women-owned
enterprises.
Mr. Speaker, we are repealing the ad-
ministration’s cruel domestic and glob-
al gag and religious refusal rules that
are cutting off lifesaving healthcare to
so many people in our own country and
around the world.
We are also making smart invest-
ments in our country’s infrastructure.
So important to my home State of
Florida is the restoration of Florida’s
Everglades, to keep the drinking water
clean and safe for over 8 million people.
I want to add, as a mother of a re-
tired United States marine war veteran
of many years and representative to so
many honorable servicemen and
-women, I recognize their selfless and
brave service to our country. So I am
especially pleased with the funding for
the Veterans Student Success Program
on college campuses that will help vet-
erans transition to student and civilian
life.
Mr. Speaker, as I said, this is an out-
standing bill for the people of this
country, and I urge my colleagues to
support the rule and the bill package.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. EMMER), a gentleman who
offered a germane amendment that was
rejected.
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I want to
echo the concerns of my colleague and
friend, Mr. STAUBER, over the rejection
of our reasonable amendment to this
bill in the Rules Committee.
In their very last days, the Obama
administration ordered Federal control
of Minnesota land in the form of a min-
eral withdrawal proposal. We were told
it was a step to protect the environ-
ment when, in reality, it was nothing
more than Washington telling Min-
nesotans that they can’t be responsible
for their own land and resources.
Blocking exploration and potential
development has devastated the region.
That is exactly what this bill will con-
tinue to do today if it passes.
I introduced the MINER Act 2 years
ago to restore the rights and respon-
sibilities back to Minnesotans as stew-
ards of our lands. The House passed our
bill last year, closely followed by ac-
tion from this administration to re-
store our rights. Yet, bureaucrats from
Washington are at it again, this time
including a provision in this bill to cre-
ate the ‘‘study’’ that is yet another
barrier, another delay tactic outside of
the normal regulatory review process.
The amendment I offered with Mr.
STAUBER would address this and simply
allow the process to move forward. Let
us be clear: Any proposed mine in the
area would still need to go through a
long and thoroughly detailed review
through the National Environmental
Policy Act and other regulatory proc-
esses. Leaseholders would be allowed to
propose a mine plan of operation and
demonstrate how they will protect the
environment in the surrounding area.
If that plan does not meet the high
standards that our State and country
require, it will be rejected.
Yet, I am disappointed by some of my
Minnesota colleagues who do not have
faith in the people of our great State.
They don’t have faith that our people
would want to protect our own land
while ensuring development and a bet-
ter future for our children.
My colleagues don’t want to enter-
tain the potential for thousands of
high-paying, labor-negotiated jobs for
northern Minnesota and the sur-
rounding region. These same men and
women, these miners, are Minnesotans
first.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Minnesota.
Mr. EMMER. These same men and
women, these miners, are Minnesotans
first. We are proud of our State’s nat-
ural beauty, and we are experts when it
comes to how to preserve it.
I believe my State is perfectly capa-
ble of abiding by the existing rules and
regulations and determining the best
way to use our land.
Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule, and I
urge my colleagues to do so as well.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my
time.
b 1345
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. SPANO).
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, earlier this
year, I was one of 169 House Members
who signed a letter to President Trump
urging him to reject any appropria-
tions legislation that would undermine
pro-life protections. The President
agreed. He agreed that long-standing
pro-life provisions should be retained
and has promised to veto any bill that
weakens those pro-life protections.
Unfortunately, the legislation before
us not only strips pro-life provisions,
but it includes language that, in fact,
undermines efforts to promote life. In
this bill, Democrats included provi-
sions that would prevent the Trump
administration from implementing its
Title X and conscience protection rules
to protect life.
The Title X Family Planning rule en-
sures that Federal funds do not go to
facilities that perform or promote
abortion as family planning. For more
than 40 years, this country has oper-
ated under the policy that not one cent
of taxpayer money can be used to fund
abortion.
We are a Nation that deeply values
religious liberty, and this rule further
protects Americans’ tax dollars from
being forced to subsidize entities that
kill unborn children.
Accordingly, I am fully supportive of
Representative ROBY’s amendment,
that we will debate this afternoon, to
strike the language that would halt
this important rule and the other
amendments that will restore pro-life
policies to this legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my
colleagues to support these provisions.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, it is tiring to hear from so
many * * * males on this floor talk
about a woman’s right to choose.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I would
just like to ask my friend if she would
like to change her last statement.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, if it pleases my colleague on
the other side, I will withdraw my
statement about sex-starved males on
the floor.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the
gentlewoman from California ask
unanimous consent to withdraw the
statement?
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I will agree to withdraw my
statement regarding——
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California?
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I know
my colleague well, and I thoroughly
enjoy working with her on the Rules
Committee.

tleman will suspend.
Is the gentleman reserving the
right——
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I am re-
serving the right to object.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to
withdraw my statement.

tleman from Georgia has reserved the
right to object.

my friend from California. I do not ob-
ject.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the words are withdrawn.
There was no objection.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I will put it in different
terms. It is tiring to be here on this
floor or in committee as a woman and
to continue to be counseled about what
types of affordable planning, whether it
is family planning, conversations that
rightfully I deserve to have with my
own doctor.
Choosing when women want to have
a family and to avoid pregnancies be-
fore they become pregnancies, it is un-
fortunate that that is something that
continues to be denied to American
women day in and day out on this
floor.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, while
we have many champions of life in this
institution on both sides of the aisle,
none is stronger than the gentleman
from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH).
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.
SMITH), a tireless fighter for life.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr.
Speaker, the bill under consideration
today reverses several—at least nine—
life-affirming, pro-life policies, includ-
ing conscience protection, Title X re-
form, the Protecting Life in Global
Health Assistance, and more.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4449
June 12, 2019
This is a pro-abortion piece of legis-
lation on steroids. But passage won’t
be the last word.
Trump will veto it and we will sus-
tain that veto.
No one, including doctors, nurses,
and LPNs, Mr. Speaker, and no entity,
like hospitals or health insurance
plans, should ever be compelled against
their will into performing, facilitating,
or subsidizing abortion.
This bill eviscerates the administra-
tion’s conscience protection rule. In
late February, HHS promulgated the
Protect Life rule to reassert portions
of President Reagan’s original Title X
regulation to end colocation of abor-
tion clinics with family planning clin-
ics under Title X. It also requires fi-
nancial separation. That, too, is re-
versed by this piece of legislation.
Among its provisions, the Protect
Life rule also seeks to protect against
child abuse, child molestation, sexual
abuse, and human trafficking.
H.R. 2740 also guts the Protecting
Life in Global Health Assistance pol-
icy, which ensures that our foreign aid
holds harmless unborn children. It,
again, is a Ronald Reagan policy ex-
panded and reiterated, and it prevents
taxpayer funds from going to—and this
is grant money—foreign NGOs that
perform or promote abortion as a
method of family planning.
Mr. Speaker, the shocking number of
unborn children killed in America is
unconscionable—approximately 61 mil-
lion dead babies since 1973—a death toll
that equates to the entire population
of Italy. All of this when our knowl-
edge about unborn children and the
breathtaking miracle of life before
birth is unparalleled.
Mr. Speaker, anyone here, parent or
grandparent, knows that the first baby
pictures today are of the child in the
womb, the ultrasound pictures that go
up on our refrigerators, so proud of the
new baby. It is not that you are going
to be a parent; you are a parent during
those 9 months.
Yet the pro-abortion movement, like
a modern day Flat Earth Society, con-
tinues to cling to outdated, indefen-
sible arguments cloaked in euphemism.
Even the seemingly benign word
‘‘choice’’ withers under scrutiny.
Choice to do what? Dismember an un-
born child piece by piece. Anyone who
watched the movie ‘‘Unplanned’’ saw
an ultrasound-guided abortion where
the child was decimated right on the
screen for all to see.
Then there is, of course, RU–486,
which first starves the baby to death,
and then the baby is expelled from the
womb. Then there are injections of
chemical poisons—all of it violence
against children.
That is what the choice is all about:
the choice of killing an innocent, de-
fenseless, unborn child.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, contraception for women is
not something that should be debated
here.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. ROYBAL-
ALLARD) for a unanimous consent re-
quest.
(Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD asked and
was given permission to revise and ex-
tend her remarks.)
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker,
I rise in support of the rule and the ap-
propriations minibus.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this Appro-
priations Minibus. These four Appropriations
bills are an investment in the American public
and provide robust funding for programs that
strengthen our society.
In the SFOPS bill, I am particularly pleased
with the strong investments in the Northern
Triangle region to address the push factors
that cause migrants to seek refuge at our
southern border.
Specifically, the bill includes $10 million dol-
lars to address sexual and gender-based vio-
lence in the region. Sexual violence has
reached crisis levels in the last several years,
causing women and children to leave their
home countries and seek asylum in the United
States.
As vice-chair of the LHHS Subcommittee, I
thank Chairwoman DELAURO and Ranking
Member COLE for their leadership and commit-
ment to the most vulnerable among us.
This FY20 ‘‘People’s Bill’’ upholds our prom-
ise to Americans by investing in workers’
needs, supporting the education of our chil-
dren, and ensuring individuals have access to
quality health programs.
The bill is a testament to our commitment to
help people obtain good paying jobs. With in-
creased funding for workforce training pro-
grams like Job Corps, and Apprenticeships,
we are creating pathways to the middle class.
The bill also invests in the future of our
country by providing robust increases to cru-
cial education programs.
With an increase of $1 billion in Title I and
IDEA, our most vulnerable students will re-
ceive the additional resources they need to re-
ceive the quality education they deserve.
For higher education, increasing the max-
imum award of the Pell grant continues our
fight against the rising costs of college.
The bill also makes a strong investment in
our nation’s public health by increasing the
CDC budget by $938 million above the 2019
enacted level.
This includes critical investments in public
health infrastructure to begin modernizing data
surveillance and analytics at CDC. It is also
the first investment in over 20 years for gun vi-
olence prevention research.
The bill also increases funding for three of
my top legislative priorities: fighting underage
drinking, supporting newborn screening, and
improving childbirth outcomes for women and
infants in all communities.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to vote in support
of this appropriations minibus to help safe-
guard the health and well-being of the most
vulnerable in our country, to ensure we have
a strong labor force and national economy,
and to ensure our country is safe and secure.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY)
for the purpose of a unanimous consent
request.
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, in light of the humani-
tarian crisis at our border and what is
happening to the migrants who seek to
come here and to the people of the
United States of America, I ask unani-
mous consent to call up H.R. 3056, an
emergency supplemental to provide
critically needed funding for the hu-
manitarian crisis at the border, and
ask for its immediate consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair would advise that all time has
been yielded for the purpose of debate
only.
Does the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia yield for the purposes of this

Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I will not. I will not yield for
that purpose, and all time yielded is for
the purpose of debate and debate only.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4450 June 12, 2019
The Rules Committee rejected the
consideration by the whole House of a
measure that would provide what we
all agree is urgently needed funding.
We are seeing some of that passion
here at this moment.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR) for the pur-

Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-

Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
to the gentleman from Pennsylvania
(Mr. PERRY) for the purpose of a unani-

Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, with
record numbers of people coming
across our border illegally, I ask unani-

Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, as a Con-
gresswoman from the border State of
Arizona, I ask unanimous consent to
call up H.R. 3056, an emergency supple-

funding for the humanitarian crisis at
our southern border, and I ask for its

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair understands that the gentle-
woman from California has not yielded

Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself 15 seconds to say when we had
this conversation in the Rules Com-
mittee yesterday—again, my friend
from California is on the Appropria-
tions Committee—and she said we
talked about bringing forward an emer-
gency funding bill that is more com-
prehensive. We are working on expe-
diting that.
I would say to my friend, agreeing to
one of these unanimous consent re-
quests would be the absolute fastest
way to expedite that if she would like
to reconsider her position.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I will not yield.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, for the
purpose of a unanimous consent re-
quest, I yield to the gentleman from
Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON).
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for
yielding.
I ask unanimous consent to call up
H.R. 3056, an emergency supplemental
to provide critically needed funding for

quest, I yield to my neighbor from the
great State of Georgia (Mr. HICE).
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I
thank my friend for yielding.
As one who just returned from the
border, and having personally seen the
enormity of the crisis there, I ask
unanimous consent to call up H.R. 3056,
an emergency supplemental to provide
critically needed funding for the hu-
manitarian crisis at the border, and I
ask for its immediate action and con-

from Virginia (Mr. CLINE).
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, to save
lives at the border, I ask unanimous
consent to call up H.R. 3056, an emer-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair understands that the gentle-
woman from California has not yielded
for that purpose; therefore, the unani-

Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
I want to remind my colleagues why
we are here today. We are considering
a bill that provides $7.97 billion in hu-
manitarian assistance, a 3.1 percent
pay raise for our troops, $1.9 billion for
the Job Corps, $41.1 billion for mental
health, for Alzheimer’s research, HIV/
AIDS, cancer research, and others.
I agree that we need to address the
humanitarian situation at the border,
and Democrats have been saying this
for a very long time. We said so when
crying toddlers were being torn apart
from their mother’s arms. We said so
when children were being put in cages.
We said so when children were being
drugged. We said so when children were
being sexually abused.
I visited those facilities. I saw the
tragedy with my own eyes. HHS needs
an influx of funds, and we cannot wait
until this bill is enacted.
In the coming weeks, we will con-
sider the administration’s request for a
supplemental appropriations bill. That
supplemental, not the fiscal year 2020
appropriations bill, is the appropriate
place to deal with this year’s ORR
funding. That is not just because we
can’t wait for the annual appropria-
tions process to be completed; it is also
because we have concerns about how
ORR is managing some of those shel-
ters.
With all the abuses that have come
to light, I know that my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle agree with us
that we need to have more oversight,
additional oversight over these facili-
ties.
Most importantly, this amendment
increases and decreases the same ac-
count. It is not an actual effect. The
children deserve more than a mes-
saging amendment. They deserve bet-
ter than that.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker. I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will amend the rule to
bring H.R. 3056 immediately to the
floor under an open rule.
I ask unanimous consent to insert
the text of my amendment in the
RECORD immediately prior to the vote
on the previous question.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia?
There was no objection.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, we
spent a great deal of time today talk-
ing about the humanitarian crisis on
the border, and that is because, despite
all of the very positive things that are
in this bill that my friend from Cali-
fornia has mentioned, what is not in
this bill is one single penny to go to
the border today. There is not a Mem-
ber of this institution who does not
know that we need that money going
to the border today.
I am not talking about contentious
issues like border security, though that
shouldn’t be a contentious issue. That
should be an issue of agreement, as
well. I am talking about an issue on
which we are unanimous, which is tak-
ing care of those people who are in the

custody of the United States of Amer-
ica.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3056 would provide
$4.5 billion. Mr. Speaker, as a fiscal
conservative, I don’t say that lightly—
$4.5 billion. That is not $4.5 billion to
get us through another year, Mr.
Speaker. That is not $4.5 billion to
start in October and run us through the
next fiscal year. That is $4.5 billion
today to address needs that exist
today, to fill shortfalls that are hap-
pening today, to solve problems that
demand solutions today.
There is not one word in this bill to
provide a single solution anywhere in
America today. But if we defeat the
previous question and amend the rule
as I have suggested, we can provide
those solutions today, and we can do it
in a partnership way that will make
America proud.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, may I inquire if the gen-
tleman has any remaining speakers.
Mr. WOODALL. I would advise my
friend that I do not see any speakers
remaining, and when the gentlewoman
has exhausted her speakers, I will be
prepared to close.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON
LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for her leader-
ship, and I thank her for the time.
This is an enormous and important
step as it relates to healthcare in
America. So many of us have been
fighting to ensure that the preexisting
conditions of Americans are protected.
I am grateful that work has been done
to provide $190 billion that covers
labor, health and human services, and
particularly $99 billion that deals with
the question of Alzheimer’s disease,
HIV/AIDS, and, certainly, work on can-
cer research. I do want to take note of
the fact that TRIO dollars have been
allowed, as well.
There is also an important point that
is probably prospectively going to be
covered, but I do want to raise it now,
and that is working with countries
that are our partners or that we would
hope that they would be partners in the
war against terror.
As the co-chair of the Pakistan Cau-
cus, I want to ensure—and I know
State, Foreign Ops, Defense is prospec-
tively coming—that I believe there has
been much work accomplished by the
new government and members of the
expanded Government of Pakistan to
work against terror.
I know that they have lost treasure
in the war against terror, and that is
the Pakistani military. So I would
hope that we would find a way to en-
sure that Pakistan receives its foreign
aid, as I believe it should, and that we
provide measuring sticks or standards
by which they can meet steps of ac-
complishment, because it is important
that we create alliances that are
strong in the region because of the dif-
ficulty of the conditions in Afghani-
stan, the recent loss of life.
We know that Afghanistan is not at
the level of security that we would
like, and I would hope that we would
work with countries in the region to
ensure the peace and security of the re-
gion and the peace and security in Af-
ghanistan.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, we are talking about
two kinds of issues down here today.
When I listen to my friend from Cali-
fornia talk about all the wonderful
things that are in the underlying bill, I
can’t tell you how much I wanted to
stand up and celebrate with her that
appropriations season is often that
way.
Mr. Speaker, you haven’t seen it in
your time, but there was a time in this
institution where the way we spent
America’s money reflected America’s
priorities, and it turned out—you
wouldn’t know it by reading the news-
paper, Mr. Speaker, but it turned out
those priorities didn’t hinge on wheth-
er you had an R or a D behind your
name. It didn’t hinge on whether you
came from the Deep South or the
Northwest.
It turned out, when we started voting
on issues one dollar at a time, we
began to find that we had agreements
with one another that had not yet been
explored. We began to find, Mr. Speak-
er, that we could celebrate achieve-
ments together in ways that had not
yet been explored.
Mr. Speaker, the year I came to Con-
gress, and many of my other colleagues
here came that very same year, you
may remember the appropriations
process hadn’t been finished by the
Democrats. When Republicans took
over, the young freshman class of
which I was a part said we need to get
down there, and we need to finish that
job. It was a Tuesday, Mr. Speaker. We
brought up the entire Federal discre-
tionary budget.
Now, that is a lousy way to do busi-
ness. It is a lousy way to do business.
We used to bring up bills one appro-
priations bill at a time.
There are 12 bills, Mr. Speaker. We
have gotten in a bad habit of omnibus
bills. As you know, what we switched
to last year and what the Democratic
majority is continuing this year is
bringing up groups of four or five bills
together.
But at that time, in the spring of
2011, Mr. Speaker, we brought them all
up. We brought them all up together.
And do you know what we said, Mr.
Speaker, the brand-new Republican
majority?
You know how it is when majorities
change, Mr. Speaker. Folks have got-
ten their feelings hurt. They feel like
they were a little wronged by the pre-
vious majority. My friend from Cali-
fornia knows what I am talking about.
You might have expected the Repub-
lican majority to say, ‘‘We are going to
jam our priorities through, diversity of
ideas be damned,’’ but we didn’t. It was
Speaker John Boehner at that time,
Mr. Speaker, and he said we are bring-
ing up the entire Federal discretionary
budget, and any Member, Mr. Speaker,
any Member from either side of the
aisle who has an idea about how to
make it better, their ideas are welcome
here on the floor of the House.
Oh, you want to talk about a festival
of democracy, Mr. Speaker? We started
on a Tuesday. We thought we were
going to be done by a Thursday. We
ended up going 24 hours a day, fin-
ishing in the early hours of Saturday
morning.
And by ‘‘finishing,’’ Mr. Speaker, I
mean we allowed every single Mem-
ber’s voice in this body be heard on
every single issue that their constitu-
ents sent them here to address. Every
Member of this institution left tired,
Mr. Speaker, but every Member of this
institution left feeling like they had
had a chance to represent their con-
stituents the way the United States
Constitution intended.
b 1415
It doesn’t always work that way, Mr.
Speaker. I sit on the Rules Committee.
We decide what amendments are made
in order and what amendments aren’t.
In the last Congress, when the Re-
publicans controlled this institution,
we didn’t make every amendment in
order. We did not make every amend-
ment in order, Mr. Speaker.
But what we did do is we made more
Democratic amendments in order than
Republican amendments. We did. But
because, for obvious reasons, when you
are in the leadership, it is easier to
push your agenda. When you have op-
portunity not to be in the leadership, it
is harder to push your agenda. We
made more Democratic amendments in
order last Congress, Mr. Speaker, than
Republican amendments in an effort to
bring a diversity of ideas.
This Congress, Mr. Speaker, when
Republicans are in the minority and
the Democratic majority is writing the
rules, 70 percent of all amendments
that have been made in order have been
Democratic amendments. Eighteen
percent of the amendments have come
to Republicans. Five times more
amendments were given to the major-
ity than to the minority. Again, we
gave more to the minority than the
majority.
I see my friends from Minnesota
down here saying, ‘‘I had an amend-
ment. It was a good idea. My constitu-
ents asked me to offer it. It is germane
to the underlying bill. I just want my
day on the floor to vote.’’ That day has
been denied, Mr. Speaker, for amend-
ment after amendment after amend-
ment after amendment. Hundreds of
amendments. Good ideas, bipartisan
ideas.
My friend from Illinois, Mr. SHIMKUS,
had an amendment, Mr. Speaker, that
required that we fund nuclear waste
disposal licensing. Nuclear waste is

spread out all across this country. I
don’t know if it is in your district, Mr.
Speaker, but I have got it right next
door to me. It is stored as best we can
across the Nation. We are trying to li-
cense a national repository. We have
spent billions as a nation preparing for
that. All he wanted was a vote on an
amendment that has wide and deep bi-
partisan support. I think it would have
won, but we will never know because
the powers that be denied him even the
chance to discuss it.
The question isn’t, is there some-
thing good in this underlying bill? The
question is, do you believe any of the
rest of us have anything to add to
make it better?
My friends made in order some Re-
publican amendments. I told you that
so far this year there have been five
times more Democratic amendments
made in order than Republican amend-
ments. This bill today is better. It is
only twice as many Democratic amend-
ments than Republican amendments. It
is still nowhere close to fair, it is still
not representative, but this is where
we are.
There is not one dollar, Mr. Speaker,
for the humanitarian crisis on the bor-
der. The New York Times in an edi-
torial on Sunday said, ‘‘The financial
reality is that this agency is over-
whelmed.’’ Talking about the Office of
Refugee Resettlement.
‘‘So far this fiscal year, it has taken
charge of nearly 41,000 unaccompanied
children, a 57 percent increase over last
year. The entire program could run out
of funding by the end of June.’’
There is not one dollar in this bill for
that. That is what my colleagues came
to ask unanimous consent to do. That
is what defeating the previous question
would do.
We all agree there is a crisis at the
border.
The editorial goes on for the New
York Times, Mr. Speaker.
‘‘There should be no ambivalence
about the urgency of addressing the
humanitarian needs. While lawmakers
wring their hands and drag their feet,
tens of thousands of migrant children
are suffering.
‘‘Congress needs to get serious about
dealing with that suffering.’’
There is no bill on its way to the
floor, Mr. Speaker, except for the one
you heard my colleague ask Member
after Member after Member for unani-
mous consent to bring. And you heard
my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle deny that. I understand. We don’t
usually get unanimous consent re-
quests to prove during Rules Com-
mittee debate.
I don’t fault my colleague for object-
ing. But if we defeat the previous ques-
tion as I am proposing, Mr. Speaker,
and we add an amendment to the rule,
we will continue to consider the bill
that my friend from California is so
proud of. But we will also consider the
bill that provides immediate funding to
the men and women serving us on the
border as they seek to address this hu-
manitarian crisis.
It gives me no pleasure to bring it up
during Rules Committee debate, Mr.
Speaker, because I don’t think we dis-
agree on this. I think we are together
on this. I cannot, for the life of me, un-
derstand why the leadership on the
Democratic side of the aisle is saying
no and no and no and no to doing some-
thing that they know needs to be done.
I do not understand it.
But I know this. Here, on Wednesday,
we have got one shot to fix it: one. Not
two, not three. There aren’t a dozen
different options. We have got one shot
to fix it.
Defeat this previous question, add an
amendment to the rule, and bring up
this emergency funding supplemental.
Do what we all know needs to be done.
If it stretches from the editorial page
of the New York Times to a conserv-
ative Republican from the deep south,
Mr. Speaker, you know it has broad bi-
partisan appeal.
We get so used to saying no in this
Chamber. We get so used to running
each other out in politics. Let’s take
yes for an answer. Let’s do something
we all know needs to be done. Let’s
take a shot at doing better today than
we did yesterday. Maybe we will come
back and do better still tomorrow.
Defeat the previous question. Add
this amendment to the bill. In the ab-
sence of that, I will have to ask that
we oppose that rule, Mr. Speaker, and
give us a chance to go back to the
drawing board one more time.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, while we may not agree
on everything, I do want to thank my
colleague from Georgia for his partici-
pation in this process. I hope we can
agree that getting back to regular
order is the right thing to do, not for
Democrats and not for Republicans,
but for the American people.
Congress cannot write a blank check
and allow children on our southern bor-
der to continue to be abused while they
are in our custody. We need trans-
parency, we need accountability. Mem-
bers of Congress need to be able to go
and inspect these facilities without
being denied entry.
On the issue of participation among
Members of Congress through this
process of appropriations, I want to
state once again that ideas are abso-
lutely welcome. However, the Appro-
priations Committee chairwoman can-
not order Members to participate in
the process. We can set up meetings
and we can invite them to come and
participate, and many did. They pre-
sented their ideas, they presented their
requests for funding for their districts,
and, guess what, 95 percent of those re-
quests were agreed upon through a
process of mitigating.
Now, if I was writing this appropria-
tions bill myself, it would look very
different. If my colleague from Georgia
was writing this appropriations bill
himself, it would look very different.
He and I both know that. But our com-
mitment is not to our personal agen-
das. Our commitment is to the rule of
law, is to democracy, and is to the
American people, our constituents,
who sent us here to represent them.
The underlying legislation is a strong
bill that is the result of good, hard
work by Members of both sides of the
aisle. It is about time that the House of
Representatives got back to doing the
business of the people in a timely man-
ner.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on
the rule and the previous question.
The material previously referred to
by Mr. WOODALL is as follows:/n
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 436/N
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing:/n
SEC. 5. That immediately upon adoption of
this resolution, the House shall resolve into
the Committee of the Whole House on the
state of the Union for consideration of the
bill (H.R. 3056) to provide supplemental ap-
propriations relating to border security, and
for other purposes. The first reading of the
bill shall be dispensed with. All points of
order against consideration of the bill are
waived. General debate shall be confined to
the bill and shall not exceed one hour equal-
ly divided and controlled by the chair and
ranking minority member of the Committee
on Appropriations. After general debate the
bill shall be considered for amendment under
the five-minute rule. Points of order against
provisions in the bill for failure to comply
with clause 2 of rule XXI are waived. Clause
2(e) of rule XXI shall not apply during con-
sideration of the bill. When the committee
rises and reports the bill back to the House
with a recommendation that the bill do pass,
the previous question shall be considered as
ordered on the bill and amendments thereto
to final passage without intervening motion
except one motion to recommit with or with-
out instructions. If the Committee of the
Whole rises and reports that it has come to
no resolution on the bill, then on the next
legislative day the House shall, immediately
after the third daily order of business under
clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Com-
mittee of the Whole for further consideration
of the bill./n
SEC. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not
apply to the consideration of H.R. 3056.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I yield back the balance of

tion on the resolution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on ordering the previous
question.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, on that
I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.

There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 431 and rule

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
consideration of the bill (H.R. 2740)
making appropriations for the Depart-
ments of Labor, Health and Human
Services, and Education, and related
agencies for the fiscal year ending Sep-
tember 30, 2020, and for other purposes,
with Mr. HECK in the chair.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the
bill is considered read the first time.
General debate shall be confined to the
bill and shall not exceed 1 hour equally
divided and controlled by the chair and
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations.
The gentlewoman from New York
(Mrs. LOWEY) and the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. GRANGER) each will
control 30 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, today, we bring four
bills to the floor that reject the slash-
and-burn approach of the Trump ad-
ministration and, instead, chart a new
course: one that increases investments
in American families to make up for
lost ground; one that gives every per-
son a better chance at a better life.
With these bills, we are investing for
the people. We invest in education and
in the health of the American people,
in infrastructure, and in the environ-
ment, in our national security and in
the needs of servicemembers and mili-
tary families.
And let me just say—because, frank-
ly, the administration’s misuse of gov-
ernment funds should concern both
parties—this bill includes necessary
oversight provisions to prohibit the ad-
ministration from misappropriating
funds, including for a border wall.
This hallowed institution must not
be a rubber stamp for Presidential pet
projects.
As chair of the State and Foreign Op-
erations Appropriations Sub-
committee, I am proud of the fiscal
year 2020 State and Foreign Operations
division, which reflects congressional
priorities that advance United States
foreign policy.
b 1430
The allocation of $56.381 billion, a 3.9
increase above fiscal year 2019, is crit-
ical to support important investments
in our national security, fund our
international commitments, and repair
America’s reputation abroad.
This bill rejects the administration’s
unacceptable budget request and irre-
sponsible policies and, rather, strives
to uphold many bipartisan congres-
sional priorities.
America’s foreign policy is strongest
when diplomacy, development, and de-
fense are well-funded and equally
prioritized, as many of today’s global
challenges cannot be addressed by mili-
tary intervention alone.
I want to quickly highlight some of
the key provisions in this division.
Unlike the administration’s fiscal
year 2020 request, this bill would en-
sure ample funding for humanitarian
assistance, multilateral organizations,
basic education, and reproductive
health services.
It would also permanently repeal the
antiwoman global gag rule and prevent
prior funds from implementing this de-
structive policy.
To restore U.S. leadership on fighting
climate change, the bill would replace
the prohibition on the Green Climate
Fund with permissive authority and
prohibit the use of funds to withdraw
from the Paris climate agreement.
It would provide robust funding to
our key allies while protecting our in-
vestments in the Northern Triangle.
Members on both sides of the aisle
know these efforts save lives, promote
goodwill, and support American inter-
ests abroad. This bill would support
these programs and restore American
leadership in the world.
Our talented Appropriations Sub-
committee chairs will tell us more
about what the other parts of this
package do for the people.
In totality, this legislation truly is a
product of hard work and bipartisan
cooperation, with input from Members
on both sides of the aisle, that meets
the diverse needs of our Nation.
Hubert Humphrey once said:
The moral test of government is how that
government treats those who are in the dawn
of life, the children; those who are in the
twilight of life, the elderly; and those in the
shadows of life.
This has been our goal. If we pass
this bill, it can be our achievement.
So as we consider this bill, let’s do so
in good faith. Let’s pass this bill for
the good of the American people.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
join me in support of this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition
to H.R. 2740.
The Appropriations Committee has
held more than 120 hearings this year
on topics ranging from our Nation’s de-
fense priorities to the crisis of unac-
companied children coming to our
southern border. We have now marked
up all 12 bills in subcommittee and full
committee.
Unfortunately, each bill brought be-
fore the committee was written to an
unrealistic top-line funding number—
$176 billion above current budget caps.
We still do not have consensus on a
budget agreement for fiscal year 2020,
which could lead to sequestration, re-
sulting in devastating cuts to our mili-
tary.
Moving these bills as-is is a wasted
opportunity because the bills are far
from what the President has requested
and will support. Defense spending does
not meet the request, while nondefense
spending greatly exceeds the request
and current levels. This could lead to a
veto and another government shut-
down, something both agreed would be
devastating.
In addition to these funding con-
cerns, these bills have, unfortunately,
become partisan vehicles, reversing
pro-life policies and risking the safety
and security of the American people.
Many provisions in this bill also
force a return to policies of the pre-
vious administration and place unnec-
essary restrictions on Federal agencies.
For example, the Labor, Health and
Human Services, and Education divi-
sion of this five-bill package includes
$100 million to help people sign up for
ObamaCare, forces the administration
to send grants to Planned Parenthood
clinics, and blocks pro-life rules from
going into effect.
Similarly, the State and Foreign Op-
erations division prevents implementa-
tion of the President’s expanded Mex-
ico City policy. It provides $479 million
to repay United Nations peacekeeping
costs, even though the United Nations
has not made the required reforms, and
prohibits funds to withdraw from the
Paris climate accord.
For defense, there is no funding for
any type of barrier or fence along the
southern border, something badly need-
ed and obvious if you visit that place.
There are also other harmful reduc-
tions. Procurement is $4.8 billion below
the FY 2019 level, and research and de-
velopment is $2.2 billion below the re-
quest.
These cuts are very concerning and
put us in a serious problem when relat-
ing to China and Russia.
The bill also repeals the Authoriza-
tion for Use of Military Force, which
could jeopardize the Defense Depart-
ment’s ability to conduct military op-
erations worldwide. It is a bad policy
and will force the DOD to unwind coun-
terterrorism operations overseas if the
Congress and the President cannot
agree on a new authorization.
The Energy and Water division only
includes half of the requested funding
for our nuclear weapons stockpile.
There is also no funding for a perma-
nent site for nuclear waste at Yucca
Mountain.
I would hope that my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle would make
in order an amendment to address im-
mediate needs on our southwest border.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4454 June 12, 2019
The ranking member of the Home-
land Security Committee, Mr. ROGERS,
and I submitted an amendment to the
Rules Committee that, unfortunately,
will not be debated today. This is yet
another missed opportunity to address
the humanitarian and security crisis.
There were over 140,000 apprehensions
of migrants at the border just last
month, making apprehensions this
year alone equivalent to the population
of Atlanta, Georgia. By the end of the
fiscal year, apprehensions could reach 1
million people.
The most troubling statistics are on
the number of unaccompanied children
coming to the border. Last week, ap-
proximately 2,500 children and teen-
agers were sleeping on the ground wait-
ing to be referred to the Department of
Health and Human Services to be con-
nected with family members and spon-
sors. HHS expects 100,000 children and
teens to be referred for placement this
fiscal year.
Unfortunately, our agencies do not
have the resources needed to care for
these children, and, in fact, HHS could
run out of money by the end of this
month—run out of money by the end of
this month. If we are not going to ad-
dress this problem in this bill, we need
to come together and pass a stand-
alone bill to meet these needs.
We were all elected to responsibly
represent the best interests of our con-
stituents, and this package falls short.
We can’t afford to overfund nondefense
programs, underfund defense initia-
tives, load these bills with controver-
sial poison pill riders, and ignore the
situation at our southern border. This
package does just this, risking both
our economic and our national secu-
rity.
I know that my colleague and friend,
Chairwoman LOWEY, has worked tire-
lessly to get us to this point today, and
she and her subcommittee chairs in-
cluded many bipartisan priorities. Un-
fortunately, on balance, these bills are
partisan measures, and I can’t support
them in their current form.
I look forward to working with my
colleagues to develop a bipartisan
budget agreement and to remove con-
troversial language and funding in a
final appropriations package.
I strongly urge my colleagues to vote
‘‘no’’ on this package today, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio
(Ms. KAPTUR), the distinguished chair-
woman of the Subcommittee on Energy
and Water.
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I thank
our able Chairwoman NITA LOWEY and
Ranking Member KAY GRANGER for
leading our Appropriations Committee
in doing the real work of America on a
bipartisan basis.
Our Energy and Water bill makes
critical investments in energy and
water systems to sustain life on Earth
by combating climate change, advanc-
ing energy science to yield innovation,
building water infrastructure and flood
control systems, and investing in nec-
essary nuclear security programs.
First, I would like to thank our rank-
ing member, Mr. SIMPSON, who has
been a very constructive and able part-
ner, and also thank our staff, including
Jaime Shimek, Angie Giancarlo, Mark
Arnone, Mike Brain, Marcel Caldwell,
Scott McKee, Farouk Ophaso, and Matt
Kaplan, for their hard work in putting
this good bill together.
This bill rejects the President’s dras-
tic and shortsighted proposed cuts that
would harm our Nation’s interests. In-
stead, our bill increases investments to
meet serious national priorities in en-
ergy and water and, of course, nuclear
security.
Addressing the needs of the future,
economically and environmentally, re-
quires that our Nation be at the fore-
front of global innovation. Our bill
moves our Nation forward on that
front.
Further, American companies require
means to ship goods efficiently in a
highly competitive global marketplace.
Our bill helps them succeed.
Finally, ensuring water and elec-
tricity for millions of Americans is
fundamental. We provide additional
support toward those priorities.
How do we achieve this? By providing
$7.4 billion for the Army Corps of Engi-
neers, an increase—yes, an increase—of
$357 million above 2019 and $2.5 billion
above the budget request. To under-
stand why, simply listen to any news
program and what is happening across
this country.
This bill invests in key water prior-
ities across our Nation by funding
countless regional priorities, including
robust funding for the Soo Locks con-
struction project, and by starting the
pathway for the Brandon Road invasive
species Asian bighead carp control
project to, literally, save the Great
Lakes.
This bill’s robust funding for the
Army Corps of Engineers is critical to
this Nation’s economic vitality.
We provide $1.63 billion for the Bu-
reau of Reclamation, an increase of $83
million from 2019 and $523 million
above the budget request.
Overall, our bill provides $37.1 billion
for the Department of Energy, an in-
crease of $1.4 billion from 2019 and $5.6
billion above the budget request.
We recognize the difficulties of serv-
ing a rising population with all of the
climate change challenges facing this
and the next generation. Within the
Department of Energy, the Energy Ef-
ficiency and Renewable Energy pro-
gram receives $2.65 billion, $273 million
above 2019 and $2.3 billion above the
budget request.
This includes robust funding for the
Weatherization Assistance Program,
which helps ensure low-income house-
holds and communities across this
country have energy-efficient, more
livable homes.
Advanced Energy Research, ARPA-E,
receives $425 million, $59 million above
2019 and a rejection of the President’s
proposal to eliminate the future. We
fund this program.
The Office of Science receives $6.87
billion, $285 million above 2019 and $1.3
billion above the budget request.
Our bill responsibly funds our Na-
tion’s nuclear deterrent, as well as in-
creases funding for nonproliferation ef-
forts while rejecting costly, poorly de-
fined, and duplicative activities pro-
posed by the administration.
The National Nuclear Security Ad-
ministration receives $15.9 billion, a
$666 million increase above 2019.
And, finally, this bill ensures the ex-
ecutive branch cannot divert essential
Army Corps funding for a border wall.
b 1445
In sum, this bill invests in innova-
tion programs at the Department of
Energy to yield future opportunities
and jobs. It promotes economic pros-
perity and bolsters trade.
The CHAIR. The time of the gentle-
woman has expired.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield an
additional 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Ohio.
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I thank
Chairwoman LOWEY for yielding me the
additional time.
Our bill helps address the many chal-
lenges facing our Great Lakes, the
largest collection of fresh water on the
planet. Our bill prepares our country to
mitigate and adapt to climate change,
with challenges like the desertization
of the West, as well as coastal resil-
iency on the Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf,
and Great Lakes coasts.
Our bill is more necessary than ever
to build and gird America going for-
ward in the great spirit of the quote
above the Speaker’s rostrum here in
the House by Daniel Webster, uttered
in 1825: ‘‘Let us develop the resources
of our land, call forth its powers, build
up its institutions, promote all its
great interests, and see whether we
also in our day and generation may not
perform something worthy to be re-
membered.’’
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this bill. Do what is right for
America. Vote for this bill.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. COLE).
Mr. COLE. Mr. Chair, I thank the dis-
tinguished ranking Republican member
of the Appropriations Committee, my
good friend, Ms. GRANGER, for yielding.
I want to begin, Mr. Chair, on a posi-
tive note. I want to thank, particu-
larly, my working partner, ROSA
DELAURO, whom I have had the great
opportunity to work with now for the
fifth year. There are a lot of good
things in this bill, a lot of things to be
proud of. Frankly, we have worked to-
gether in the past and continued to
work together in this bill.
I am particularly pleased with the
additional support for the National In-
stitutes of Health and for the Centers
for Disease Control.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4455
June 12, 2019
I very much support the focus on
early childhood education, on first-gen-
eration college students through pro-
grams like TRIO and GEAR UP, frank-
ly, through our ChalleNGe children,
the IDEA program, and many other
good provisions. However, there are
certainly a number of other things in
this bill that mean I won’t be able to
support it at this time.
I was disappointed to see language
inserted throughout the bill that ties
the hands of the administration in
many ways. The bill forces a return to
the Obama-era policies on Title X fam-
ily programs. The bill ties the hands of
the administration by not allowing it
to process waivers that protect deeply
held religious beliefs of institutions
that provide vital services funded in
the bill.
The bill micromanages the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services,
even going so far as to prescribe spe-
cific amounts of money to be used in
advertising programs.
I am also concerned about a number
of limitations in this bill that are
going to lead to a Presidential veto.
While the bill does many good things,
I remain concerned that it has been de-
veloped in a vacuum. As my good
friend, the ranking member, said, these
numbers are simply too high. They are
not going to be accepted by a Repub-
lican Senate. They are not going to be
signed by the President of the United
States, and we run the risk of a Presi-
dential veto.
We need to come together, Mr. Chair,
House and Senate, Republicans and
Democrats, with the administration to
hammer out a deal on top-line funding
before we can move forward and actu-
ally move this bill into law.
Finally, I would be remiss if I did not
mention the significant crisis facing us
on our southern border. That has yet to
be addressed in this bill, and a number
of our speakers have made that point.
The Department of Health and
Human Services, Mr. Chair, is at the
breaking point. We literally will go
broke this month taking care of unac-
companied children unless the major-
ity works with the administration and
their Republican colleagues to address
this problem.
I want to end by announcing that I
will oppose the bill, but I look forward
to working with my friends on the
other side as we go through the proc-
ess. I am convinced that under Chair-
woman LOWEY’s leadership with Rank-
ing Member GRANGER, we can arrive at
a good solution for the country.
This is a work in progress, and I
think it is going to get better as it
moves through the process.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I am very
pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. VISCLOSKY),
the chairman of the Defense Sub-
committee.
(Mr. VISCLOSKY asked and was
given permission to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chair, I would
like to begin by expressing my appre-
ciation, as I discuss the defense portion
of this bill, to my ranking member, Mr.
CALVERT. He has made it easy to con-
tinue the collegiality, transparency,
and bipartisanship that is a hallmark
of the Defense Subcommittee. He is a
wonderful partner.
I also do want to express my grati-
tude to Chairwoman LOWEY, Ranking
Member GRANGER, and the other mem-
bers of the subcommittee and full com-
mittee for their efforts. I want to also
thank the staff. This legislation would
not be possible without their out-
standing effort.
At this time, I would like to high-
light some of the elements of this leg-
islation that deal with the well-being
and morale of those in uniform.
The bill provides a 3.1 percent pay
raise for our women and men in uni-
form. This is the largest increase in
basic pay since 2010. The report ex-
presses, however, support for a 3.1 per-
cent pay increase for DOD civilian em-
ployees as well.
We rely on DOD civilians to work
side by side with military personnel.
The administration’s refusal to request
an increase in pay for Federal employ-
ees devalues the important work done
by these public servants. Congress
must rectify this failure.
I believe that access to affordable
and quality childcare is vital to reten-
tion for All-Volunteer Forces, particu-
larly for mid-career personnel. Thou-
sands of military children are
waitlisted for childcare development
centers, and I am disappointed that the
services have failed to meaningfully
address this serious problem. To get at
the backlog, the bill provides an addi-
tional $70.7 million for upgrades to
military childcare facilities.
The pervasiveness of sexual assault
amongst servicemembers is deeply ab-
horrent. It is disheartening that the
most recent report on this subject
shows that sexual assaults across the
U.S. military increased by a rate of 38
percent last year, with over two-thirds
of assaults going unreported.
The bill provides $297.2 million for
Sexual Assault Prevention and Re-
sponse programs at the service level,
$13.5 million above the fiscal year 2019-
enacted level. It also provides an addi-
tional $35 million for the Special Vic-
tims Counsel and $3 million for the
Sexual Trauma Response and Treat-
ment pilot program.
The bill provides $1.26 billion for en-
vironmental restoration activities,
which is $188 million above the current
request.
There are also several actions taken
in the bill that I believe are important
to highlight as an appropriator and as
a member of the legislative branch.
In recent years, the Department has
viewed report language as suggestive
and, on several occasions, has taken
action in contravention of it or simply
ignored congressional direction in the
report. It is unacceptable, and it must
stop. Report language is directive; it is
not permissive.
I would also point out that the budg-
et justifications should be complete in
detail. In many instances, they con-
tinue to be lacking.
For example, there was a $72 million
request to establish a Space Force, but
the Department was unable to answer
basic questions about the structure of
the force, nor could they provide de-
tailed long-term costs.
Another example would be the pro-
posed reorganization of the Military
Health System. In its 2020 request, the
Department requested a significant
amount of money for the reorganiza-
tion and proposed major reductions in
healthcare billets. Yet, it could not an-
swer basic questions about how the re-
organization would affect servicemem-
bers and beneficiaries.
This legislation also takes steps to
return to balance the relationship be-
tween the executive and legislative
branches in response to the administra-
tion’s unconstitutional use of dollars
appropriated for the military to fund
the construction of a wall on our
southern border. If Congress appro-
priates funds for a designated and au-
thorized purpose, it is not lawful for
those funds to be used in contravention
of the law.
In closing, I reiterate my thanks to
Mr. CALVERT and the members of our
subcommittee, as well as our wonderful
staff for their exceptional work, dedi-
cation, and long hours.
I look forward to the debate on our
amendments.
Mr. Chair, I would like to begin by express-
ing appreciation to Ranking Member CALVERT.
He has made it easy to continue the
collegiality, transparency, and bipartisanship
that is the hallmark of the Defense Sub-
committee.
I also would like to express my gratitude to
Chairwoman LOWEY, Ranking Member
GRANGER, and the other Members of the Sub-
committee for their efforts. And thank you to
the Subcommittee staff, particularly the clerks,
Becky Leggieri and Leslie Albright, as well as
Walter Hearne, Brooke Boyer, Ariana Sarar,
Jackie Ripke, David Bortnick, Matt Bower, Bill
Adkins, Jennifer Chartrand, Hayden Milberg,
Paul Kilbride, Shannon Richter, Sherry Young,
Kyle McFarland, Johnnie Kaberle, Kiya
Batmanglidj, and Jamie McCormick. I would
also like to acknowledge the personal office
staff, Joe DeVooght, Preston Rackauskas, Re-
becca Keightley, and Christopher Romero.
This legislation would not be possible without
their outstanding effort.
The bill would provide $690.2 billion for the
Department of Defense, which is $15.8 billion
above the fiscal year 2019 enacted level and
$8 billion below the request. The base funding
recommendation is $622.1 billion, which is
$15.6 billion above the fiscal year 2019 en-
acted level and $88.2 billion above the re-
quest. The overseas contingency operations
recommendation is $68.1 billion, which is $165
million above the fiscal year 2019 enacted
level and $96.2 billion below the request.
This bill supports the Department of De-
fense’s effort to align its resources with the
National Defense Strategy. This strategy redi-
rects the Department’s primary focus toward
the challenges posed by great powers such as

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4456 June 12, 2019
China and Russia, and their efforts to counter
and challenge the technological and oper-
ational superiority long enjoyed by the United
States military. This technological overmatch
can no longer be assumed, and this bill pro-
vides funding to develop and field new weap-
on systems and capabilities to address these
new challenges. To support this forward-look-
ing posture, the bill makes major investments
in procurement and research and develop-
ment.
Rather than focus my remarks on those in-
vestments, which have been detailed in sev-
eral documents released by the Committee to
the public, I am instead going to run through
some of the efforts in this legislation that deal
with the well-being and morale of those in uni-
form, their families, DoD civilians, and defense
communities.
The bill provides a 3.1 percent pay raise for
our women and men in uniform. This is the
largest increase in basic pay since 2010 and
maintains the Committee’s commitment to en-
suring our all-volunteer force is compensated
for their sacrifices.
The report expresses support for a 3.1 per-
cent pay increase for DoD civilian employees.
We rely on DoD civilians to work side-by-side
with military personnel to provide medical care
for our troops, to perform vital logistics, main-
tenance, acquisition, and other essential serv-
ices. The Administration’s refusal to request
an increase in pay for federal employees de-
values the important work done by these pub-
lic servants and I hope this Congress will ulti-
mately rectify that in this year’s appropriations
measures.
I believe that access to affordable and qual-
ity childcare is vital to retention in the all-vol-
unteer force, particularly for mid-career en-
listed and officers. Thousands of military chil-
dren, including over 9,000 whose parents
serve in the Navy, are waitlisted for Childcare
Development Centers. I am disappointed that
with such demonstrated need the military serv-
ices’ requests for childcare facilities were rel-
atively unchanged from prior years. To get at
this backlog, the bill provides an additional
$70. 7 million for upgrades to military childcare
facilities, which is complementary to an effort
included in the FY20 Military Construction Ap-
propriation measure to accelerate the con-
struction of new Childcare Development Cen-
ters.
The pervasiveness of sexual assault
amongst service members is deeply abhorrent
and it is disheartening that the most recent re-
port on the subject shows that sexual assaults
across the U.S. military increased by a rate of
nearly 38 percent in 2018, with over two-thirds
of assaults going unreported, The bill provides
$297.2 million for Sexual Assault Prevention
and Response programs at the Service level,
$13.5 million above the FY19 enacted level
and equal to the request. It also provides an
additional $35 million for Special Victims
Counsel for victims of sexual assault and $3
million for a Sexual Trauma Treatment Pilot
Program for treatment of members of the
Armed Forces for PTSD Related to Military
Sexual Trauma.
The bill provides $1.26 billion for environ-
mental restoration activities, which is $188 mil-
lion above the request. This includes $13 mil-
lion for a nationwide health study on the impli-
cations of PFOS/PFOA at former and current
domestic military installations. Further, the re-
port directs the Department to achieve a drink-
ing water cleanup standard equal to or better
than the EPA health advisory level for feder-
ally controlled sites and surrounding commu-
nities whose water sources were contaminated
because of Department activities.
I believe these efforts and several others
within the bill will have an immediate positive
impact on people’s quality of life.
There are also several actions taken in the
bill that I believe are important to highlight as
an Appropriator and a Member of the Legisla-
tive Branch.
In recent years, the Department has viewed
report language as suggestive, and on several
occasions has taken actions in direct con-
travention or simply ignored Congressional di-
rection in the report. That is unacceptable and
must stop. Report language is directive, not
permissive.
For example, in FY19 the Committee Report
expressed significant displeasure with the in-
adequate budget justification by the Depart-
ment of Defense. There have been improve-
ments in certain areas, but a number of major
proposals put forth by the DoD in the FY20
budget were incredibly lacking in detail. For
example, there was a $72 million request to
establish a Space Force, but the Department
was unable to answer basic questions about
the structure of the force, nor could the detail
long-term costs. Because of that uncertainty,
the Committee only provides $15 million for
Space Force.
Another example would be the proposed re-
organization of the Military Health System.
This reorganization was mandated in the 2017
Defense Authorization Act. In its FY20 request
the Department requested a significant
amount of money for the reorganization and
proposed a major reduction in healthcare bil-
lets. Yet it could not answer basic questions
about how the reorganization would affect
service members and beneficiaries. Of par-
ticular concern to the Committee were impacts
to pediatrics, maternity care, and mental
health. The legislation halts the reorganization
until those questions can be answered.
Further, this legislation takes several steps
to return to balance the relationship between
the Executive and Legislative Branch, in re-
sponse to the Administration’s unconstitutional
use of dollars appropriated for the military to
fund the construction of the wall on the south-
ern border. The Constitution gives the Con-
gress the power of the purse. And if Congress
appropriates funds for a designated and au-
thorized purpose, it is not lawful for those
funds to be used in contravention of that direc-
tion.
Specifically, the bill reduces the amount of
money the Department can move between ac-
counts by 75 percent from the FY 2019 levels.
This reduction leaves the Department with
$1.5 billion in general transfer authority, which
allows for the meeting of urgent and emergent
military requirements. The legislation also in-
creases the notification requirements and re-
quires additional detail be provided to Con-
gress in order for the Department to repro-
gram funding or start a new program. These
are not actions that were taken lightly, but are
absolutely necessary in order to allow Con-
gress to carry out its Article I responsibilities.
Finally, I feel compelled to spend a moment
discussing the issue that has been an alba-
tross around this Committee’s neck since Au-
gust 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act (BCA). In
past years, I have bemoaned the sheer lunacy
of the BCA and how it has made this Commit-
tee’s work that much more difficult. Unfortu-
nately, that dynamic remains until Congress
and the President come together and find a
solution to the BCA caps for FY20 and FY21.
I understand that this is not a simple matter.
However, I fail to see the benefit from delaying
the conversation any longer.
In closing, I would like to again reiterate my
thanks to Members and staff that logged the
long hard hours required to put this product to-
gether and I look forward to debate on the
amendments.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 6
minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. ROGERS).
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair,
I thank the distinguished Republican
ranking member on the committee for
this time but also, more importantly,
for her wise leadership of this com-
mittee.
Mr. Chair, I rise in reluctant opposi-
tion to H.R. 2740, the first appropria-
tions measure to be considered by the
House for fiscal year 2020.
In February, while completing the
fiscal year 2019 appropriations process,
I began my remarks by drawing atten-
tion to the crisis at our southern bor-
der. Four months later, the crisis is
even worse, and the bill we have before
us today would only throw fuel on the
fire.
Our committee prides itself on stay-
ing above the partisan fray, but this
package significantly constrains the
administration’s ability to respond ap-
propriately. The partisan policy riders
are misguided and dangerous.
In addition to these substantive prob-
lems, the bill before us today provides
funding for numerous departments and
agencies without a bipartisan, bi-
cameral budget agreement supported
by the President.
Budget uncertainty is nothing new,
but overall spending increases of this
magnitude are neither realistic nor
sustainable without a plan.
While this package does provide mod-
est increases for total defense spend-
ing, it is still $17 billion below the
President’s request, risking the great
strides we have made to rebuild our
military.
Despite these challenges, Chair-
woman LOWEY and Ranking Member
GRANGER have worked hard to tackle
many problems this year. Just yester-
day, for example, we marked up the
last two appropriations bills in full
committee.
As ranking member of the State,
Foreign Operations, and Related Pro-
grams Subcommittee, I offer my
thanks to Chairwoman LOWEY for her
collaboration. I am pleased that the
chair decided to lead our sub-
committee, in addition to her duties of
chairing the full committee, given our
long relationship. She cares deeply
about these programs and, despite our
differences, remains a reliable partner.
Division D, the State and Foreign
Operations Appropriations bill for fis-
cal year 2020, includes $48 billion in
base funding. That is nearly a 5 percent

increase over fiscal year 2019. With the
additional $8 billion in overseas contin-
gency operations, OCO, the total is
$56.3 billion.
Within that total, this bill includes
funding for many key priorities that
are critical to our national security.
Chief among them is $3.3 billion in for-
eign military financing for Israel. We
don’t need to look further than the re-
cent headlines to understand how im-
portant and timely our support is for
Israel’s security.
The bill also maintains funding at
last year’s level for other close part-
ners in the region, including Egypt,
Jordan, and Tunisia.
Another shared priority is the safety
of our diplomats and development ex-
perts serving abroad. This bill supports
those efforts with robust funding for
embassy security.
Funding is also included to strength-
en our efforts on the international
front to combat the flow of drugs into
our country. Overdose deaths, Mr.
Chair, from synthetic opioids like
fentanyl jumped 45 percent in just 1
year from 2016 to 2017, increasing in all
demographics and virtually every
State.
We should all be concerned that co-
caine and methamphetamine use in the
U.S. is climbing again at an alarming
rate.
b 1500
Funding is provided in the bill to
help Colombia better control its coca
production as counternarcotics efforts
are redoubled in the region. We need to
get this drug epidemic, this calamity,
under control, and I believe this fund-
ing is a step in the right direction.
Despite these worthy investments,
partisan policy riders included in this
portion of the bill mean it has no hope
of becoming the law of the land. Sweep-
ing measures, like those that overturn
the President’s expanded Mexico City
policy, go well beyond what was done
previously.
The bill also prohibits funds from
being used to withdraw from the Paris
climate agreement and allows for a
contribution to the unauthorized Green
Climate Fund. The President is well
within his authority to back out of this
agreement that would cost billions of
American jobs, harm domestic manu-
facturing, and damage our growing
economy.
I look forward to debating amend-
ments on these and other issues in the
bill.
Therefore, without a budget agree-
ment, in light of partisan riders block-
ing pro-life policies and overturning bi-
partisan agreements on climate
change, as well as efforts to undermine
an adequate response to the crisis at
our southern border, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this bill.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield 5
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO), who is the chair of the
Labor, Health and Human Services,
Education, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee.
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I rise to
speak about the fiscal year 2020 appro-
priations bill for the Labor, Health and
Human Services, Education, and Re-
lated Agencies.
To start, let me recognize the rank-
ing member, TOM COLE, for his work on
this bill. We have worked closely to-
gether over the years inasmuch as we
have developed a mutual respect for
one another. While we may have dif-
ferences of opinions, we have the same
values about the scope of these pro-
grams and whom they ought to be ben-
efiting.
I want to say thank you to the rank-
ing member of the full committee, Con-
gresswoman GRANGER. I believe we
have put together very strong and seri-
ous resources in the Labor-H bill.
I want to say a particular thank you
to the chair of the full committee, Con-
gresswoman NITA LOWEY, for making
the Labor-H bill a high priority.
The Labor-HHS-Education bill sup-
ports some of the Nation’s most crit-
ical programs. They touch individuals
and families throughout their lifespan,
from Early Head Start to the Social
Security Administration.
For 2020, the subcommittee is pro-
viding a total of $189.9 billion in discre-
tionary funding. It is an increase of
nearly $12 billion over last year’s en-
acted levels.
Our mission has been to advance a
positive agenda, to look at issues
where programs have been starved, and
to reflect the oversight we have been
conducting. I believe we have done so.
To arrive at these figures, we hosted
12 hearings on the budget, predatory
for-profit colleges, Federal student
loan servicing, the unaccompanied
children program, wage theft, and the
administration’s cost-increasing
changes to the Affordable Care Act.
We collected nearly 15,000 requests
from Members, and we fulfilled, in part
or in whole, more than 90 percent of
them.
With this input, we produced what I
believe to be historic investments in
working people, in students, in parents,
in children, in families, and in our fu-
ture.
We make a historic $4 billion in-
crease over last year for early child-
hood programs: $2.4 billion for the
childcare and development block grant,
equal to 300,000 new slots for childcare;
$1.5 billion for Head Start; and $100
million for preschool development
grants.
We also increased funding for K–12
education by $3.4 billion, $1 billion
more for title I, and $1 billion more for
IDEA, State grants for special edu-
cation. In post-secondary education, we
make an additional investment of $928
million. We increase the maximum Pell
grant award by $150.
In health, we make a net increase of
$2 billion in the National Institutes of
Health, enabling a 5 percent increase
for all institutes and centers. We also
increased the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention’s budget by $938
million.
We held the first appropriations hear-
ing on gun violence prevention re-
search in 20 years. Experts told us that
the CDC and the NIH can do and must
do this research, so we provide $50 mil-
lion for gun violence prevention re-
search.
We are investing in women’s health.
That includes a $114 million increase
for Title X. Title X provides annually
more than 4 million low-income women
and men with contraception counseling
services and health screenings. These
investments transform lives.
We know this President is highly in-
vested in continuing what we call a tax
on women’s health. We know the power
of the White House and that the Presi-
dent will reject a repeal of the Hyde
amendment. That is why this bill
maintains current law with regard to
the Hyde amendment.
The Hyde amendment is a discrimi-
natory policy that makes access to
basic reproductive healthcare contin-
gent on your income. That is simply
wrong, and I oppose it, as do others. We
will continue the long fight, and we
will win that fight in the near term to
ensure that women of color, low-in-
come women, and all women are on
equal footing with regard to reproduc-
tive rights.
Finally, we invest in working people
whose pay does not keep up with their
rising costs. They struggle to deal with
healthcare, prescription drugs, and
childcare.
We invest an additional $1.2 billion to
help working people find good-paying
jobs and to protect and empower them
in the workplace. That includes $69
million more for at least 500 new inves-
tigators at the Wage and Hour Division
to combat wage theft and to help work-
ing people receive their full pay.
I am also proud of the new initiatives
we are introducing. We provide $150
million for community colleges and
other 4-year institutions to train work-
ing people for in-demand industries.
For too long, working people and mid-
dle-class families have been short-
changed, and we are moving ambi-
tiously to make sure that we provide
every individual with a better chance
at a better life.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. CLEAVER).
The time of the gentlewoman has ex-
pired.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield an
additional 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Connecticut.
Ms. DELAURO. We are moving ambi-
tiously to make sure that we provide
every individual with a better chance
at a better life because we believe that
that is our obligation as Members of
Congress.
Once again, I want to say thank you
to the ranking member, Mr. COLE; to
the chair, Mrs. LOWEY; to the ranking
member of the full committee, Ms.
GRANGER; and to all the subcommittee
members who worked so hard in put-
ting this effort together.

Mignone, Stephen Steigleder, and Phil-
ip Tizzani; and for the minority, Susan

Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 5
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CALVERT).
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I thank
Ranking Member GRANGER and Chair-
woman LOWEY both for their leadership
and expertise throughout this process.
I also acknowledge the work of
Chairman VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chair, I am
grateful for Mr. VISCLOSKY’s dedication
to our U.S. servicemembers and our na-
tional security and for his willingness
to listen and work with us to put to-
gether this bill. I very much appreciate
the bipartisan way in which the gen-
tleman has managed the Defense Sub-
committee. It has been an honor to
work with him, and I look forward to
finishing our work on time.
There is a lot of good work in this
bill. However, the United States faces
an increasingly challenging geo-
political landscape, one that requires a
strong U.S. military to help maintain
global peace and stability.
While we have been at war in the
Middle East for nearly two decades,
other regions of the world have been
watching us and chipping away at our
military superiority. Unfortunately,
the funding levels recommended in this
bill are inadequate to enable us to ad-
dress the needs of our military and
maintain our superiority over our ad-
versaries.
The fiscal year 2020 Defense bill be-
fore the House today includes $622 bil-
lion in base funding and another $68
billion in overseas contingency oper-
ations, or OCO, funding, for a total of
$690 billion. The amount is roughly $8
billion less than the request.
This funding level is not adequate to
address the myriad of issues that we
face around the world, including from
an increasingly aggressive Russia. Just
last week, a Russian destroyer came
dangerously and recklessly close to one
of our vessels in the Philippine Sea.
Shortchanging defense funding would
send the wrong message to our adver-
saries. Let’s be clear: We do not want a
fair fight. Funding the Department to
ensure our advantage against any
threat is the best deterrent to war.
In addition to the low funding levels
in the bill, it includes a number of
troubling provisions adopted in com-
mittee, including a new restriction on
the Department’s ability to provide
lawful assistance to other agencies in
combating the real crisis on our south-
ern border.
We cannot continue to ignore the re-
ality along our southern border. The
sheer numbers of people coming across
our borders, in the hundreds of thou-
sands, now require the use of military
bases to house migrants.
The situation is untenable, and the
Congress must update our immigration
laws to make the process more rational
and enforceable. Restricting the Presi-
dent’s ability to address the crisis will
only make the problem worse and put
more people at risk as they embark on
a dangerous journey.
I am also concerned with the lan-
guage striking the Authorization for
Use of Military Force. This provision
would repeal the current authorization
240 days after enactment. This is a seri-
ous topic that needs to be debated by
the authorizing committees. Including
this language in an appropriations bill
with little debate and no committee
hearings or witnesses is not the correct
way to address this matter. Broad-
casting to our enemies the stop date of
any military operation is reckless and
irresponsible.
Then there is the issue of numbers.
In divided government, bipartisanship
is essential. Unfortunately, until we
reach agreement on the top-line spend-
ing levels that the President will also
support, I remain concerned that the
Defense funding bill will be crafted in
an environment in which we have no
budgetary certainty. Without a top-
line budget agreement, and a 2-year
deal with the House, the Senate, and
the White House to relieve the budget
caps put in place by the Budget Control
Act, we are not making spending deci-
sions based in reality.
If we cannot come to an agreement
on a budget caps deal, we face seques-
tration in the coming year. The im-
pacts would reverse all the progress on
readiness and modernization we have
achieved over the last 2 years. Seques-
tration would cut $20 billion from the
Navy and $29 billion from the Air
Force, and it would stop 100 Army pro-
grams.
We need all the parties to come to-
gether at the table now to make the
tough but critical budget decisions. We
know all too well how devastating
budgetary ambiguity and continuing
resolutions can be for defense planning
and the real-world impact it has on
training, readiness, and quality-of-life
issues. That is a recipe for disaster for
both our military and the American
people.
That is why I cannot support this bill
at this time. I want to work with my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle
to develop bills for fiscal year 2020 that
meet our Nation’s defense and border
security priorities in a fiscally respon-
sible manner.
Given the chairman’s nature, I am
sure that he will be an able partner and
leader in any effort to strike a budget
agreement and certainly happy to help
avert sequestration.
Finally, I thank the staff on both
sides of the aisle for their hard work. I
appreciate their diligence.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LEE), who is a member of
the Appropriations Committee.
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chair, I
thank Chairwoman LOWEY for her lead-
ership, for yielding, and for her tireless
work day and night on behalf of the
American people.
As a member of the Labor, Health
and Human Services, Education, and
Related Agencies Subcommittee, I am
really pleased to see such a comprehen-
sive bill that strongly invests in our
communities.
For example, there is a $150 million
increase for HIV research at NIH and
an $8 million increase to the Office of
Minority Health to ensure decreases in
health disparities for our communities
of color. We have a $92 million increase
to Historically Black Colleges and Uni-
versities’ and Hispanic-Serving Institu-
tions’ undergraduate programs to help
improve higher education access for
our students of color.
Also, it is important to recognize the
$65 million increase to the Education
Innovation Research grants for com-
puter science for young girls and stu-
dents of color, and the $9 million in-
crease for teen pregnancy prevention
and the $114 million increase to Title X
Family Planning, both programs pro-
viding evidence-based, comprehensive
sex education.
Also, as the proud vice chair of the
State, Foreign Operations, and Related
Programs Subcommittee, we increased
the Global Fund. It remains, of course,
at 33 percent, sending an important
signal, in terms of our leadership to
international partners, that we intend
for the United States to stay in the
leadership to address the HIV/AIDS
pandemic.
b 1515
Let me just say, with regard to de-
fense, yes, we did, and I want to thank
those who have supported this effort to
repeal the 2001 AUMF, Authorization
to Use Military Force.
It was passed 3 days after the horrific
tragedy of 9/11. It was 60 words. It has
now allowed for the use of force over 41
times in 17 countries, unrelated to the
terrible events of 9/11.
So, we need to do our job. We need to
allow Congress to debate and make
some decisions on a new AUMF.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentlewoman has expired.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield the
gentlewoman from California an addi-
tional 1 minute.
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chair, the
point is we will have 8 months to de-
bate a new authorization, depending on
what this Congress determines should
move forward as the Authorization to
Use Military Force.
The 2001 was passed in 3 days. Cer-
tainly, 8 months gives us enough time

quires us not to be missing in action.
We have the power of the purse, and
we should use that because we have
sent our young men and women into
harm’s way. They have done their job.
They need to know now that, in the
wars in which they are engaged, Con-
gress has their back.
We should make some decisions on
this, and it doesn’t make any sense to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4459
June 12, 2019
continue using this authorization on
wars 18 years later.
Twenty percent of Members of Con-
gress serving today were here in 2001.
Members deserve to represent their
constituents and to debate and to
make sure their voices are heard also.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 5 minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON).
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I thank the
chairwoman for yielding time.
I rise today in reluctant opposition
to H.R. 2740, the four-bill fiscal 2020 ap-
propriations package that includes the
Energy and Water Development appro-
priations bill.
As ranking member of that sub-
committee, I know there are several bi-
partisan priorities in the bill, but, un-
fortunately, the overall four-bill pack-
age is too flawed for me to be able to
support it at this time.
First and foremost, these bills were
developed using top-line funding levels
that do not reflect a bipartisan, bi-
cameral agreement.
The reality is that we are dealing
with monopoly money here, and we all
know that. These will not be the final
numbers that come out whenever we
reach an agreement.
The majority’s budget framework
also promotes the misguided notion
that increases to defense spending
must be matched or exceeded by in-
creases in nondefense spending.
In the Energy and Water bill specifi-
cally, a bill that was roughly half de-
fense and half nondefense spending in
fiscal year 2019, the increase for non-
defense programs is more than 11⁄2
times the increase for defense pro-
grams.
While I support many of the non-
defense programs in this bill, we need
to know the broader budgetary context
before we can decide whether indi-
vidual programs are funded appro-
priately.
We must work together with the Sen-
ate and the White House and develop
an agreement on overall spending caps.
Only then can we write bills that can
be passed by both Chambers and that
the President will sign.
Speaking of the Energy and Water
bill specifically, one of my highest pri-
orities in this bill is the Department of
Energy’s nuclear energy program. The
bill includes many good investments
within that account, but, overall, the
account is kept essentially flat from
last year.
This decision is a bit perplexing. The
bill’s allocation is well above last
year’s, and the majority has stated an
intent to focus on technologies to ad-
dress climate change.
The subcommittee held several hear-
ings, at which Members of both parties
and witnesses discussed the necessity
of advanced nuclear technologies in
any kind of low-carbon energy future,
yet the nuclear energy program does
not share in the funding increases pro-
vided for almost all of the other non-
defense programs. I am hopeful that, as
the bill moves forward, we can address
this issue and create a stronger bill.
The bill continues significant invest-
ments in our Nation’s water resources
infrastructure, including harbor main-
tenance activities.
Unfortunately, while the majority in-
cluded additional funding for critical
water storage projects, they also de-
cided not to allow previous appro-
priated dollars to be put to good use.
The exclusion of the Shasta Dam and
Reservoir Enlargement Project
amounts to throwing away a key op-
portunity to enhance water security in
the drought-prone West.
The full House should have been al-
lowed to consider the Calvert amend-
ment to correct this problem in the
bill.
While the majority has referred to
funding increases for the National Nu-
clear Security Administration, the
truth is the bill does not sufficiently
prioritize activities to maintain and
modernize our nuclear weapons stock-
pile.
The Weapons Activities program is
$648 million below the budget request.
That is more than half a billion dollars
below the budget request. As detailed
in the Statement of Administration
Policy, these cuts to the budget re-
quest will delay efforts to improve
safety and security features and dis-
rupt alignment with the Department of
Defense’s plans.
Since this delay typically leads to in-
creases, reduced spending does not ac-
tually save money; it costs money. We
must make the investments necessary
to invest in a safe, reliable, and effec-
tive stockpile.
Finally, I am disappointed that the
bill does not include any funding to ad-
vance the Yucca Mountain licensing
application process and, instead, offers
a false promise of interim storage as a
solution to the nuclear waste issue.
Funding for interim storage alone
cannot solve the issue of nuclear waste
disposal, especially since current law
strictly limits Federal action in this
area.
Additionally, interim storage loca-
tions will be much more difficult to
site if there are no assurances of a per-
manent disposal, as the interim sites
would become de facto permanent
sites.
The Governor of New Mexico recently
raised this very point in expressing her
concerns about a private interim stor-
age site proposed to be located in her
State.
Continuing the licensing process is a
necessary step to establish a perma-
nent repository for our Nation’s de-
fense and commercial nuclear waste.
Over the past few decades, electricity
consumers across the country have
paid roughly $41 billion, with accrued
interest, into the Nuclear Waste Fund
for permanent disposal of nuclear
waste. Due to the political decision to
halt advancement of a permanent re-
pository, however, it is the taxpayers—
not ratepayers but taxpayers—in all
435 congressional districts who cur-
rently are paying $2.2 million a day,
more than $800 million per year, to
cover the cost of temporary onsite
storage.
My colleague from Illinois (Mr. SHIM-
KUS) filed an amendment to address
this, but it was not allowed. We have
had strong bipartisan support in the
past for this issue.
Despite our disagreements over the
issues that I have mentioned, I want to
close by thanking Chairwoman KAPTUR
and the majority staff and my staff for
their dedication and hard work on this
bill.
Ms. KAPTUR and I have worked to-
gether on the Energy and Water Devel-
opment, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee for several years now; and,
while we don’t agree on every issue, I
value our friendship and continue to
appreciate the collegial and coopera-
tive tradition of the subcommittee.
I would also like to thank Chair-
woman LOWEY and Ranking Member
GRANGER of the full committee for
their leadership and support for the im-
portant programs in the Energy and
Water bill.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
minute to the distinguished gentleman
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the major-
ity leader.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chair, I thank the
chairwoman for yielding, and I want to
say I thank the chair and I thank Ms.
GRANGER for her leadership and work-
ing with the chair, Mrs. LOWEY, on get-
ting these bills to the floor.
As a member of the Appropriations
Committee, albeit on leave, I am very
proud of this committee. This com-
mittee is probably the most critical
committee in the sense that, if it
doesn’t get its work done, we shut
down the government. No other com-
mittee can say that, luckily.
But I am pleased, as the majority
leader, to say that it has been my in-
tent, working with the chair and the
ranking member, to complete this ap-
propriations process in a timely fash-
ion.
Mr. Chair, the new Democratic ma-
jority began this Congress in the mid-
dle of a damaging government shut-
down. Even though we had a bipartisan
agreement on spending levels—which
we don’t yet have—and the Repub-
licans held both Chambers of Congress
and the executive, they failed a funda-
mental responsibility of funding all of
government. And, as a result, we had a
partial shutdown.
This week, the Democratic majority,
working with the Republican minority
in the House—and I had the privilege of
serving with Ms. GRANGER actively on
the committee—is moving the first
four appropriations bills to the floor
for consideration, with passage ex-
pected early next week.
It is my hope that, by moving
through this process, we can help pre-
vent a shutdown and, rationally, adopt
the priorities of this country, both
from a national security standpoint

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4460 June 12, 2019
and from a national security stand-
point on domestic investments.
The bills that are included in this
package show our commitment to a
stronger military, supporting critical
research to combat diseases, more edu-
cational opportunities for our people,
prioritizing diplomacy and more robust
water and energy infrastructure, and a
more accountable government.
It is a funding package for the peo-
ple. I am particularly proud of the
Labor, HHS, Education, and Related
Agencies bill. In my estimate, it is the
best I have had the opportunity to vote
for throughout my career.
It supports a more competitive work-
force, advances healthcare research
and access, stands up for women’s
health, and invests in future genera-
tions by funding important educational
initiatives; such as, full-service com-
munity schools, a Special Olympics
that provides so many opportunities to
those with intellectual disabilities, and
after-school programming.
These are all critical programs for
our national security that President
Trump has proposed, unfortunately,
eliminating.
Moreover, the Energy and Water bill
before us supports the Chesapeake Bay
Oyster Restoration Project, which is
important to our State, but also impor-
tant to one of America’s great estu-
aries.
We are doing all that while bringing
the package of appropriations bills to
the floor under a rule that allows for
genuine bipartisan debate and amend-
ment.
As I have said before, the House in-
tends to do its job by passing all 12 ap-
propriations bills before the end of
June so that we have ample time to go
to conference with the Senate and com-
plete them before the end of the fiscal
year.
That will be a historic step if we, to-
gether, can accomplish it. The Demo-
cratic-led House ended the Trump shut-
down earlier this year. And the Demo-
cratic-led House is going to do its part
to prevent another Trump shutdown in
October.
Let me reiterate, though, that we
want to do it in a bipartisan way.
Again, I thank the chair and the rank-
ing member for being such construc-
tive, positive participants in this proc-
ess.
The best way to accomplish our ob-
jective, though, is for House and Sen-
ate Democrats and Republicans to
reach agreement before the fall on lift-
ing the sequester caps based on the
principle of parity while, at the same
time, extending or eliminating the
debt limit.
I talked to Senator MCCONNELL in
January. Both he and I agreed that we
ought to get a caps agreement.
I regret that we have not done that,
so we are proceeding under a deemed
number. That is not the perfect way to
do it, but it is the only way we had
available to us to get our work done.
I observe that Mr. SHELBY, who is the
chairman of the Appropriations Com-
mittee, for my Republican friends, in-
dicated he thought he might well fol-
low the House and deem numbers. As a
practical matter, that is the only way
to do it absent agreement.
Agreement on top-line numbers will
make it easier for the House and Sen-
ate to agree on individual appropria-
tions bills that can be sent to the
President’s desk.
Together, we have a responsibility to
make the investments the American
people have entrusted us to make. I re-
alize that we do not all agree, but we
ought to, as a democratic body, decide
that we will vote on our disagreements
and we will resolve those by vote, as we
did when the Republican side was in
charge.
And, very frankly, we disagreed with
many of those bills, but they became
law, five of them. And, as a result, we
funded the majority of the expendi-
tures in the last year, even though we
shut down most of the agencies of gov-
ernment at the end of the year into
this year.
So, Mr. Chair, I would urge my
friends to pursue this debate in an or-
derly fashion, realizing that we
couldn’t make all 600 amendments in
order, but also realizing that we will
have an opportunity to debate the eq-
uities that we think are important,
come to a decision, and pass those bills
to the Senate.
Hopefully, the Senate will pass them,
and we will have conferences. Some
Members don’t know what conferences
are.
When I started on the Appropriations
Committee in 1983, and in the 23 years
thereafter—in the early years, we real-
ly had conferences, and all the mem-
bers of the subcommittee were mem-
bers of the conference. And we met
with the Senate; we debated back and
forth; and we came out with the com-
promised bills.
When I started on the Appropriations
Committee, there were really no Re-
publicans and no Democrats. One may
think that is a surprising statement.
All were advocates. Some had different
points of view, but they were advocates
of making sure that we funded our gov-
ernment in a rational, democratic way,
which means the majority will rule, as
it did last year.
So, I urge my colleagues: Let us do
our business. We will have differences,
but do not allow those differences to
undermine the ability of this House to
operate in a rational, constructive
manner.

Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. HUDSON).
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank
distinguished Ranking Member
GRANGER for her strong leadership on
the committee and for yielding this
time to me.
Mr. Chairman, I rise today to call at-
tention to a serious issue of mis-
management between the Community
Development Institute, known by its
acronym, CDI, and the Office of Head
Start.
I wholeheartedly support the Head
Start program, and I know it has the
power to change lives. In fact, my
mother is a retired Head Start teacher,
and I know the impact on her students
was profound.
However, I have also seen, firsthand,
the damage that can quickly happen to
a community when proper oversight is
not conducted over local Head Start
programs, especially once CDI assumes
control.
In Cabarrus County, my home county
in the Eighth District of North Caro-
lina, we have witnessed CDI continu-
ously demonstrate an inability to en-
sure the federally mandated guidelines
outlined in the Head Start Act are met.
While I have been impressed by the
new Head Start national Director, Dr.
Deborah Bergeron, I adamantly believe
Congress needs to exercise more over-
sight when it comes to Head Start and
CDI—not just in my congressional dis-
trict, but across the Nation.
I would like to ask Congresswoman
DELAURO to work with me to make
sure Head Start and CDI are held ac-
countable and ensure the most vulner-
able children in our communities re-
ceive the best preschool education pos-
sible.
Ms. DELAURO. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. HUDSON. I yield to the gentle-
woman from Connecticut.
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chairman, the
gentleman and I have had these con-
versations, and I appreciate being able
to speak with him.
Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman
from North Carolina (Mr. HUDSON) for
bringing attention to this critical
issue. I proudly support increased ac-
cess to Head Start for all children,
which is why this bill provides an in-
crease of $1.5 billion for this important
program.
Mr. Chairman, let me commit to
working with the gentleman and the
agency to get to the bottom of this
issue that has impacted the children in
his district and prevented access to
high-quality early childhood edu-
cation.
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chair, I look for-
ward to working with the gentlewoman
and my other colleagues to protect the
Head Start program and ensure this
does not happen again in my district,
but I also want to help make sure it
doesn’t happen to any child who is de-
nied access to these vital education
programs.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), the
chairwoman of the Military Construc-
tion, Veterans Affairs, and Related
Agencies Subcommittee.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.
Chairman, I want to thank the chair of
the committee for her leadership
throughout our appropriations process.
We now have a funding bill on the floor

this week that makes critical invest-
ments and advances American values.
I want to touch on the part of the
State and Foreign Operations bill that
deals with support for the Venezuelan
people. I am thrilled with the support
in the bill for Venezuela, for her peo-
ple, because the Venezuelan people are
enduring an unimaginable onslaught of
hunger, danger, and escalating eco-
nomic pain, and America cannot stand
idly by.
As a member of the Appropriations
Committee and the Representative
with the largest Venezuelan population
in the United States, I am thrilled that
the bill has language that allocates aid
to Colombia to assist communities
that are impacted by refugee and mi-
grant populations fleeing the despotic
Maduro regime.
Congresswoman SHALALA and I vis-
ited Colombia and met with starving
and impoverished Venezuelans and saw,
firsthand, the need for this funding. We
saw the blocked bridges and met with
Venezuelans shot by their own military
to prevent them from delivering hu-
manitarian aid to their own people.
The bill also includes funding for de-
mocracy promotion, human rights, and
civil society programs in Venezuela,
and I was proud to work with the chair-
woman to include this vital funding.
Perhaps most important is what this
bill does not do, what it does not con-
tain, which is the traditional prohibi-
tion on funds being provided to the
central Government of Venezuela, with
the clear hope that we might have a co-
operating regime to work with in the
near future.
The U.S. rightfully recognizes Juan
Guaido as the legitimate interim Presi-
dent of Venezuela.
Viva Venezuela. We must continue to
work to make sure that she can transi-
tion to a democracy and the vibrant
nation that she once was.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. YOHO).
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentlewoman for yielding time.
Mr. Chair, we stand at a moment in
history. Seventy years after the end of
World War II and 30 years after the end
of the Cold War, the world is still bat-
tling authoritarianism. However, due
to the increased global economic inte-
gration, authoritarian states have
begun to utilize practices of economic
coercion and predatory lending to take
advantage of developing nations.
These vulnerable countries are pre-
sented with funding for major develop-
ment projects, which ultimately lead
to unrepayable debt. When these gov-
ernments cannot fulfill their financial
obligations, they are forced to give up
strategic ports and lands that can now
be used by the authoritarian regimes
to achieve diplomatic and strategic
aims that threaten democracies and
stability.
At the same time, we face the chal-
lenge and opportunity of leading the
global effort to combat extreme pov-
erty and disease, with an increasing
recognition that public investment and
grants alone are insufficient for the
task.
To tackle these issues, I worked with
my colleagues last Congress to pass the
new U.S. Development Finance Cor-
poration. This critical tool put Amer-
ica and her allies in the position to
counter economic coercion by ensuring
that our government maximizes the
impact of our resources through a co-
ordinated strategy that prioritizes the
mobilization of private capital through
a variety of investment structures and
partnerships.
Additionally, the DFC will work
much more closely with our lead devel-
opment agency, USAID, and ensure we
focus on sustainable development and
allowing countries to make the transi-
tion from aid to trade through invest-
ments in infrastructure.
As the implementation of the new
DFC continues, I look forward to en-
gaging with my colleagues and pro-
viding this new entity with the suffi-
cient funding and flexibility it needs to
achieve our Nation’s foreign policy
goals.
I applaud Chairwoman LOWEY and
Ranking Member GRANGER’s support
for the new DFC. I would also like to
thank my colleagues ADAM SMITH, HAL
ROGERS, and JEFF FORTENBERRY for
their support and engagement on this
critical issue.
It is paramount that we get this pol-
icy right to show America’s commit-
ment and continued leadership in forg-
ing strong foreign policy that benefits
all.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self the balance of my time.
Before I close, I would like to thank
the staff for their tireless work, par-
ticularly Steve Marchese, Craig Hig-
gins, Erin Kolodjeski, Dean Koulouris,
Jason Wheelock, Jean Kwon, Marin
Stein, Clelia Alvarado, Liz Leibowitz,
and Wendy Coursen. And all those
whom I didn’t include, I thank all the
other staff who have been so really re-
markable in this very important work.
With this bill, we have forged a vi-
sion that stands in stark contrast to
the reckless austerity of recent years
and the bleak view presented in the ad-
ministration’s budget request. This is a
bill for the people. It will strengthen
communities, improve lives, and help
repair our standing in the world, and I
urge support.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

TITLE X—TO DIRECT THE REMOVAL OF
UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES FROM
HOSTILITIES IN THE REPUBLIC OF
YEMEN THAT HAVE NOT BEEN AUTHOR-
IZED BY CONGRESS
SEC. 10001. FINDINGS.
Congress makes the following findings:
(1) Congress has the sole power to declare war
under article I, section 8, clause 11 of the United
States Constitution.
(2) Congress has not declared war with respect
to, or provided a specific statutory authoriza-
tion for, the conflict between military forces led
by Saudi Arabia, including forces from the
United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Egypt,
Jordan, Morocco, Senegal, and Sudan (the
Saudi-led coalition), against the Houthis, also
known as Ansar Allah, in the Republic of
Yemen.
(3) Since March 2015, members of the United
States Armed Forces have been introduced into
hostilities between the Saudi-led coalition and
the Houthis, including providing to the Saudi-
led coalition aerial targeting assistance, intel-
ligence sharing, and mid-flight aerial refueling.
(4) The United States has established a Joint
Combined Planning Cell with Saudi Arabia, in
which members of the United States Armed
Forces assist in aerial targeting and help to co-
ordinate military and intelligence activities.
(5) In December 2017, Secretary of Defense
James N. Mattis stated, ‘‘We have gone in to be
very—to be helpful where we can in identifying
how you do target analysis and how you make
certain you hit the right thing.’’.
(6) The conflict between the Saudi-led coali-
tion and the Houthis constitutes, within the
meaning of section 4(a) of the War Powers Reso-
lution (50 U.S.C. 1543(a)), either hostilities or a
situation where imminent involvement in hos-
tilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances
into which United States Armed Forces have
been introduced.
(7) Section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution
(50 U.S.C. 1544(c)) states that ‘‘at any time that
United States Armed Forces are engaged in hos-
tilities outside the territory of the United States,
its possessions and territories without a declara-
tion of war or specific statutory authorization,
such forces shall be removed by the President if
the Congress so directs’’.
(8) Section 8(c) of the War Powers Resolution
(50 U.S.C. 1547(c)) defines the introduction of
United States Armed Forces to include ‘‘the as-
signment of members of such armed forces to
command, coordinate, participate in the move-
ment of, or accompany the regular or irregular
military forces of any foreign country or govern-
ment when such military forces are engaged, or
there exists an imminent threat that such forces
will become engaged, in hostilities,’’ and activi-
ties that the United States is conducting in sup-
port of the Saudi-led coalition, including aerial
refueling and targeting assistance, fall within
this definition.
(9) Section 1013 of the Department of State
Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1984 and 1985
(50 U.S.C. 1546a) provides that any joint resolu-
tion or bill to require the removal of United
States Armed Forces engaged in hostilities with-
out a declaration of war or specific statutory
authorization shall be considered in accordance
with the expedited procedures of section 601(b)
of the International Security and Arms Export
Control Act of 1976 (Public Law 94–329; 90 Stat.
765).
(10) No specific statutory authorization for
the use of United States Armed Forces with re-
spect to the conflict between the Saudi-led coali-
tion and the Houthis in Yemen has been en-
acted, and no provision of law explicitly author-
izes the provision of targeting assistance or of

FORCES FROM HOSTILITIES IN THE

GRESS.
Pursuant to section 1013 of the Department of

1985 (50 U.S.C. 1546a) and in accordance with
the provisions of section 601(b) of the Inter-
national Security Assistance and Arms Export
Control Act of 1976 (Public Law 94–329; 90 Stat.
765), Congress hereby directs the President to re-
move United States Armed Forces from hos-
tilities in or affecting the Republic of Yemen, ex-

AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR. COLE
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 1 printed in
part B of House Report 116–109.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Chairman, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as
follows:
Page 116, lines 15 through 20, strike section
240.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentleman
from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Oklahoma.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. DAVID P. ROE).
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I strongly support this amend-
ment and the HHS conscience rule.
As a staunch pro-life OB/GYN physi-
cian who practiced for over 31 years
and delivered nearly 5,000 babies, it
sickens me to think that we would
force a healthcare provider to perform
a procedure that violates their con-
science or religious beliefs.
Although it may come as a shock to
some Democrats to learn that many
providers are pro-life and forcing them
to choose between their legitimate,
sincerely-held beliefs and the law is
wrong, removing this rule can’t force
me or other healthcare providers to
violate our conscience.
This is a simple concept. Doctors and
other healthcare professionals should
not be forced to perform or participate
in abortions, assisted suicide, or any
other service that would violate their
conscience.
Opponents of the HHS rule will tell
you that the rule is about denial of
care. They will tell you that the rule is
intended to allow discrimination.
There could be nothing further from
the truth. The HHS rule protects
healthcare providers from discrimina-
tion if they choose to act according to
their conscience.
We have a First Amendment right to
practice our religion in America, and
the government forcing someone to act
in a way that violates those beliefs is
in direct opposition to the very founda-
tion of our Constitution.
This is not about forcing a medical
provider’s religious beliefs or my be-
liefs on anyone. This is about not forc-
ing a medical provider to abandon their
beliefs due to an arbitrary government
action.
The HHS conscience rule is a moral
rule, and I oppose efforts to block its
implementation in this appropriations
bill. I encourage my colleagues to sup-
port this amendment.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Chair, I reserve the
balance of my time.
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chairman, I
claim time in opposition to the amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Connecticut is recognized for 5
minutes.
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I strongly
oppose my colleague’s amendment that
would allow the Department of Health
and Human Services to use funding in
this bill to implement the Trump-
Pence refusal of care rule.
Personal beliefs should never deter-
mine the type of healthcare an indi-
vidual receives. However, the adminis-
tration’s rule would completely under-
mine patient protections by allowing
hospitals, doctors, nurses, and other in-
dividuals and institutions to deny a pa-
tient standard medical care based on
personal beliefs, not based on what is
best for the patient.
Current law already provides protec-
tions for hospitals and healthcare
workers to refuse to perform abortions,
but the administration’s rule would ex-
pand Federal law to allow certain indi-
viduals and entities to refuse care for
any reason at all. That is why we added
a provision to the Labor-HHS-Edu-
cation bill to block this unacceptable
rule.
Let’s be clear: Freedom of religion is
important. It is already protected by
the First Amendment. However, this
freedom does not give anyone the right
to impose their religious beliefs on oth-
ers, to hurt others, or to discriminate.
This rule has never been about reli-
gious liberty. It has been about dis-
criminating, shaming, and denying in-
dividuals the healthcare they need.
Under this rule, we know women will
be denied access to standard medical
care. We know hospitals have refused
to treat or refer an individual who
needs an abortion.
Under this rule, we know a
transgender individual can be denied
medical care. For women in rural com-
munities, small towns, or in an emer-
gency situation, the hospital or phar-
macy that says ‘‘no’’ means these
women will not get the care they need.
In this bill, we have made invest-
ments to right these wrongs, yet this
rule would completely undermine those
efforts instead of addressing real areas
of concern.
b 1545
The Trump-Pence administration is
completely obsessed with allowing in-
stitutions and providers the license to
put their religious doctrine before an
individual’s health.
As stewards of taxpayer dollars, we
cannot allow these dollars to be used to
deny medical care because of religious
beliefs, nor can we allow an individual
to impose their religious beliefs on an-
other individual. That could lead to
tremendous harm, including deaths.
Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose this
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from New
Jersey (Mr. SMITH), my good friend,
and the most distinguished defender of
life in this Chamber.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Chair,
I thank the gentleman very much for
his amendment and for yielding.
Mr. Chair, in 2009, Nurse Cathy
DeCarlo was ordered at Mt. Sinai Hos-
pital in New York, to assist in the
abortion of a 22-week-old unborn child.
Under threat of being fired, she said
the hospital ordered her to assist in the
‘‘bloody dismemberment of a baby,’’
her words, ‘‘and accounting for the
body parts afterward,’’ which must be
done during these abortions.
She said this coercion caused her in-
tense emotional pain and she has had
‘‘nightmares about babies crying in the
dark . . .’’ ever since.
She appealed to the HHS Office for
Civil Rights, but her pleas to enforce
her civil rights fell on deaf ears.
No one, Mr. Chair, should ever be
pressured or threatened or coerced to
perform or facilitate in the killing of a
baby.
Abortion is not healthcare.
HHS recently promulgated an essen-
tial new regulation to enforce 25 con-
gressionally-enacted conscience laws
and provisions to protect individuals,
healthcare entities, and providers from
discrimination.
H.R. 2740 stops this regulation by not
allowing funds to be used to implement
it.
Let me point out that HHS points
out that the rule will robustly enforce
investigations, supervising compliance,
making enforcement referrals when
necessary to Justice, and remediate

the effects of discrimination in coordi-
nation with other funding components
in HHS, which may include with-
holding Federal funds as appropriate.
We need to be serious about con-
science rights.
We cannot coerce and tell someone
like Cathy DeCarlo or nurses in my
State of New Jersey who are told,
under condition of losing their jobs,
they had to assist in abortions.
Abortion takes the life of a baby. It
includes dismemberment and chemical
poisoning.
And just think about this: my friends
on the other side of the aisle just sim-
ply refuse to acknowledge that there is
a baby. And that baby deserves respect
and protection.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
vote for the Cole amendment.
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, may I in-
quire how much time is remaining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
has 21⁄2 minutes remaining.
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LEE), a member of the Ap-
propriations Subcommittee on Labor,
Health and Human Services, Edu-
cation, and Related Agencies.
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chair, I
rise in strong opposition to this amend-
ment.
First of all, this dangerous and dis-
criminatory rule attempts to enshrine
discrimination in virtually all facets of
healthcare by granting new rights to
those who believe that their personal
and religious beliefs should determine
the care that a patient receives.
Under this rule, nearly anyone or any
entity involved in a patient’s care,
from a pharmacist, to a receptionist
who schedules procedures, to hospital
room schedulers, can put their personal
and religious beliefs ahead of a pa-
tient’s health.
This rule could mean that rape sur-
vivors, same-sex couples, women with
unintended pregnancies, those seeking
life-saving abortions, and transgender
patients could all be refused medical
care.
Mr. Chair, I have to tell a story. This
reminds me of my late mother. When
my mother was pregnant and about to
deliver me, she needed a cesarean sec-
tion. She was refused admittance into
the hospital because she was Black.
She nearly died. I almost didn’t make
it here into this world because of reli-
gious beliefs that it was okay to deny
healthcare to African Americans.
Mr. Chair, let’s not go back there.
One’s personal religious beliefs
should never determine the care a pa-
tient receives. Instead, hospitals, doc-
tors, nurses, and other individuals
should be making decisions based on
what is best for the patient.
Mr. Chair, yes, we know that it is
those who need care the most that will
be disproportionally impacted, like pa-
tients of color, low-income patients,
and the LGBTQ community.
Mr. Chair, I urge defeat of this
amendment. It is discriminatory, it is
dangerous. Let’s not go back to the
days of discrimination. It is un-Amer-
ican.
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield the
balance of my time to the gentle-
woman from Florida (Ms. FRANKEL).
Ms. FRANKEL. Mr. Chair, I oppose
this very cruel amendment which sup-
ports the Trump administration’s rule
that allows virtually any individual or
entity involved in a patient’s care,
from a hospital’s board of directors to
a receptionist that schedules proce-
dures, to put personal beliefs ahead of
a patient’s health.
This antiabortion obsession has gone
to the ridiculousness.
Under this Trump rule, a pharmacist
could refuse to fill a prescription for
birth control, a receptionist could
refuse to schedule an abortion for a
child rape victim, an ambulance driver
could refuse to take a patient suffering
from miscarriage to the hospital, all
based upon their personal beliefs, not
the patient’s welfare.
Mr. Chair, this rule is dangerous. The
amendment is dangerous. It should be
killed before it kills us.
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Chairman, I yield my-
self the balance of my time.
Mr. Chairman, the bill as reported
out of the full Appropriations Com-
mittee contains a poison pill which my
amendment seeks to remove.
The rider of the underlying bill
blocks the exercise of civil rights of all
Americans.
Last month, the Department of
Health and Human Services issued a
rule which gives the Office for Civil
Rights the tools it needs to investigate
discrimination and enforce the laws as
written.
The new rule protects physicians,
pharmacists, nurses, teachers, stu-
dents, and faith-based charities, who do
not wish to provide, participate in, pay
for, provide coverage for, or refer to
services such as abortion, sterilization,
or assisted suicide.
The Labor-HHS bill will never be-
come law if this language remains in
it.
Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to
support this amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a
recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Oklahoma will be
postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. MCGOVERN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 2 printed in
part B of House Report 116–109.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 88, line 1, insert ‘‘, including medi-
cally-tailored meals’’ after ‘‘nutrition’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentleman
from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN)
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Massachusetts.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself 2 minutes.
Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my
amendment to H.R. 2740, which will en-
sure that seniors have access to medi-
cally-tailored meals, a proven inter-
vention that improves health and
drives down costs.
Two of the most difficult issues to
combat in healthcare are, one, man-
aging chronic diseases like heart dis-
ease and diabetes; and, two, addressing
social determinates of health like hun-
ger and poverty.
The statistics are shocking. Eighty
percent of older Americans have at
least one chronic disease, 77 percent
have at least two chronic diseases, and
5 million seniors in our country face
hunger.
That is where medically-tailored
meals come in.
These meals are customized to ad-
dress a person’s specific healthcare
needs. Think of a heart-healthy meal
for a heart disease patient or a low-
sugar one for a diabetic.
These meals not only help reduce the
reliance on costly pharmaceuticals,
they can help lower overall healthcare
costs, improve health, and alleviate
hunger.
Take a study done by the Massachu-
setts Commonwealth Care Alliance,
which showed that people receiving
medically-tailored home-delivered
meals had fewer ER visits and fewer
hospital readmissions.
That saves the consumer on copays
and out-of-pocket costs. It saves the
hospital and insurance provider, like
Medicare, even more on needless emer-
gency room visits and costly hospital
stays.
My amendment does a very simple
thing: it will ensure that the Adminis-
tration for Community Living, which
oversees senior nutrition programing,
funds programs for medically-tailored
meal delivery.
Mr. Chairman, medically-tailored
meals improve health outcomes, they
lower costs, and they are just smart
policy. I encourage my colleagues to
vote ‘‘yes’’.
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. PIN-
GREE), who has been a leader on this
and so many other issues regarding
food and nutrition.
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I thank my
colleague and friend, Chairman MCGOV-
ERN, for yielding me this time.
Mr. Chair, I rise to support Chairman
MCGOVERN’s amendment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4532 June 12, 2019
As members of the Food is Medicine
working group, one of our priorities
has been highlighting the benefits of
medically-tailored meals.
Many of us know the importance of a
nutritious, balanced diet, but we also
know that many face significant hur-
dles in finding, buying, and preparing
healthy food.
For people with chronic and acute
disease, these challenges can lead to
major health complications and major
hospital bills. That is where medically-
tailored meals come in.
Study after study show that partici-
pants with access to medically-tailored
meal programs had fewer hospital inpa-
tient admissions and fewer emergency
department visits.
That is a big potential cost savings
for programs like Medicare and Med-
icaid, but more importantly, it is a
critical tool for keeping vulnerable
Americans, like our seniors, healthy
and independent, which is exactly in
line with the goals of the Older Ameri-
cans Act.
The gentleman’s amendment would
allow more seniors to access medically-
tailored meals through OAA programs.
I think this is an important step to-
wards strengthening health outcomes
and quality of life, and I urge its pas-
sage.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, how
much time do I have remaining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
has 2 minutes remaining.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Chairman, as the gentlewoman
from Maine stated, I cochair the Food
is Medicine working group, along with
Ms. PINGREE, who is on it, and my col-
league from Kansas, ROGER MARSHALL,
and I want to thank them for their
work on these issues. I also want to
thank KATIE PORTER, who is also a co-
sponsor of this amendment.
The bottom line is this is common
sense.
Mr. Chair, I want to also acknowl-
edge the great work being done on this
issue at the Center for Health Law and
Policy Innovation at Harvard Law
School and the Friedman School of Nu-
trition at Tufts.
Mr. Chair, I want to acknowledge
groups like Community Servings,
which is in my district, which admin-
isters medically-tailored meals, as well
as Food & Friends here in Washington,
D.C., and the Food is Medicine Coali-
tion.
The bottom line is this not only is
good for patients and can help improve
healthcare outcomes for individuals
and in some cases literally save lives,
but it also will save a boatload of
money.
As I mentioned earlier, when you are
readmitted to a hospital prematurely,
that hospital gets punished, the insur-
ance company has to kick in again,
you have to pay more out-of-pocket ex-
penses.
Mr. Chair, we can do this better. We
need to think differently about how we
approach healthcare. This is one way
to do it.
Mr. Chair, again, I urge everybody to
support this amendment. I hope it re-
ceives broad bipartisan support.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts (Mr.
MCGOVERN).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. ROY. Mr. Chair, I demand a re-
corded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to

ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Massachusetts will
be postponed.

AMENDMENT NO. 3 OFFERED BY MR. RASKIN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 3 printed in
part B of House Report 116–109.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 63, line 13, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(increased by $5,000,000)’’.
Page 134, line 20, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(reduced by $5,000,000)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentleman
from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Maryland.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chair, I rise today
to offer an amendment to H.R. 2740 to
increase funding for the National Insti-
tutes of Health, located in Bethesda,
Maryland. It would provide a modest $5
million increase to NIH’s building and
facilities account.
Mr. Chair, this amendment would in-
crease funding for the NIH, which is
proudly housed in the Eighth Congres-
sional District of Maryland, and it
would constitute a $5 million increase
to the NIH building and facilities ac-
count to begin to address an estimated
$2 billion backlog in maintenance and
repairs.
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO), the
distinguished chair of the Labor,
Health and Human Services, Edu-
cation, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee of the Appropriations Com-
mittee.
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I thank
the gentleman for his amendment.
Researchers on the campuses of the
National Institutes of Health conduct
groundbreaking, lifesaving research on
diseases and disorders that affect indi-
viduals and families across the Nation.
These researchers need state-of-the-art
facilities and equipment to conduct
this research, which is why I was proud
to provide an increase in funding for
NIH facility maintenance and con-
struction in fiscal year 2019 in the ap-
propriations bill.
This year’s bill maintains that level
of support and allows NIH to make
progress in reducing its backlog of fa-
cilities projects. I share the gentle-
man’s concern about this issue. I look
forward to working with him in the fu-
ture to address NIH’s facility construc-
tion and maintenance needs.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chair, the NIH, of
course, is a national treasure, which
sets the standard for cutting-edge bio-
medical research in our country. Its
breakthroughs have saved the lives of
countless Americans and remains a
source of hope for millions more across
the country.
While the NIH does, indeed, under
this bill, receive the necessary funding
increase for scientific research and
medical treatments, NIH’s buildings,
the places where the scientists conduct
their research and where medical pro-
fessionals provide patients with their
treatments, have fallen into alarming
and embarrassing disrepair and decay.
There have been significant issues
with flooding, broken fire sprinklers,
deteriorating plumbing systems, and
massive water pipe ruptures. A steam
pipe leak flooded a basement where ex-
pensive equipment is stored.
Last year, a clinic was evacuated
when antifreeze began leaking from the
ceiling. A corroded pipe had caused a
flood of glycol—that is antifreeze—in
the mechanical room, which can be
seen in chart one. And in chart two,
this is the flood that resulted from the
gushing from the ceiling into the clinic
below. This presented a very dangerous
situation.
So when I say that the NIH des-
perately needs funding for mainte-
nance and repairs, we are not talking
about minor aesthetic quibbles; we are
talking about very serious structural
renovations that are needed. $5 million
is just a drop in the bucket in terms of
what NIH actually needs, but we have
to start somewhere.
Having spoken with Ms. DELAURO, I
will actually withdraw the amendment.
I understand that we are able to re-
ceive consideration from the sub-
committee. I want to thank her very
much for her willingness to work with
us.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time, and I withdraw the amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. ESPAILLAT).

from Florida (Ms. SHALALA) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Chair, last week
The Washington Post reported that the
administration is canceling English
classes, recreational programs, and
legal aid for unaccompanied minors in
migrant shelters.
The largest of these shelters, the
Homestead detention facility, is in my
district’s backyard. The children
housed at the Homestead facility are
between the ages of 13 and 17. Despite
their youth, they have already faced
unfathomable hardship, including pov-
erty and violence in their home coun-
tries and the journey they have made
to ours.
But because of our anti-immigrant,
antichild policies, their hardship
doesn’t end at our border. These chil-
dren are taken to detention facilities
like the one at Homestead, which cur-
rently houses 2,350 kids.
I have seen the prison-like conditions
in which they are kept. In fact, if they
were in our Federal prisons, they would
be better treated.
In our Federal prisons murderers
have 30-minute meals, but at these fa-
cilities for children, the kids have only
15 minutes to eat their meals.
Federal prisoners are entitled to 300
minutes of phone calls per month,
while these children have only 80 min-
utes a month to call their families.
They are closely monitored, unable
to leave the compound, kept in mili-
tary camp-like rooms with up to 150
kids per room. We do not have a Fed-
eral prison in this country which
houses 150 persons in one room. They
are barred from even hugging their
friends or siblings. Some of these kids
have been forcefully separated from
their parents without explanation.
And what is more, the Homestead fa-
cility is for profit. We are letting a pri-
vate company make money off of these
children’s tears.
Now, without classes, recreational
programs, or even legal aid, these kids
are on their own in every way imag-
inable. This is utterly un-American.
The canceling of classes, programs, and
legal aid for these kids is only the lat-
est step in this administration’s anti-
immigrant agenda.
We have a moral obligation to treat
these children like we would treat our
own, and that means providing them
with the support they need during and
after their detention.
I have introduced an amendment to
the appropriations bill, H.R. 2740, that
will increase funding for legal services,
child advocates, and post-release serv-
ices by $10 million. These are basic
services that the administration is le-
gally obligated to provide to unaccom-
panied children who are detained in
these shelters. Our laws require us to
do so.
Our budget must be smart; it must be
careful; and it must be compassionate.
We have a chance to show that there is
no excuse for the mistreatment of our
most vulnerable children. I urge my
colleagues to support my amendment
to this appropriations bill. These chil-
dren are our collective responsibility,
and they deserve better.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.

and I thank the Congresswoman so
much for introducing this amendment.
That is why the underlying bill under
consideration today set aside a min-
imum of $190 million for these activi-
ties. Legal services need to be a pri-
ority for these children.
Studies have demonstrated that
when a child has access to legal rep-
resentation, the in absentia rate drops
to 5 percent. Released children with at-
torneys show up to court and continue
to show up to court until case comple-
tion in 95 percent of the cases.
Child advocates support the most
vulnerable of children who are in
ORR’s care. There were 15,000 tender-
age children, children under the age of
12, in ORR’s care last year. This year,
more than 11,000 children have been
transferred to HHS care, through April,
and again, that is only for children
ages zero to 12.
Legal services, child advocates, and
post-release services cannot be consid-
ered optional, and we should not fund
them as if they are. So I thank the gen-
tlewoman, and I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. PETERS).
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chair, I thank Con-
gresswoman SHALALA for her work and
this timely amendment to add $10 mil-
lion for critical services for children
for things like legal services, child ad-
vocates, counseling, and mental health
services.
There is a humanitarian catastrophe
at the border today. In San Diego, we
see the kids and families who have
traveled a long and treacherous path,
but when they arrive, they are met
with inhumane living conditions. ICE
and CBP facilities are overcrowded,
and it hardly gets better once the fami-
lies are released.
Refugee resettlement agencies and
the local governments have been the
primary providers of these support
services. The influx of families have
left shelters overburdened and commu-
nity resources strained.
The San Diego community has
stepped up to meet this need when the
administration has not, but these extra
funds will protect families and ensure
that all who claim asylum get the due
process they are guaranteed under
international law.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Chair, let me just
remind everyone that these children
are our collective responsibility. They
deserve better, and I urge my col-
leagues to support my amendment to
this appropriations bill.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Florida (Ms. SHALALA).
The question was taken; and the Act-

Mr. ROY. Mr. Chair, I demand a re-
corded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentlewoman from Florida will be
postponed.

Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Chair, our
economy and our Nation’s workforce
are at a critical juncture. The intro-
duction of new technology and easier
flow of people and information from
one location to another have trans-
formed our economy and our workforce
in ways that were unpredictable and
have created both benefits and risks.
We need to be careful, however, that we
are not leaving Americans behind.
Several years ago, I worked with a
number of colleagues to go across the
country to ask researchers and have
townhalls in communities, from Cali-
fornia to New Jersey, what the effect
on technology, in particular, and what
the future of work wages in the labor
movement would be as our work trans-
forms.
One common theme that we heard
over and over again across the coun-
try—whether it was California, Wis-
consin, Michigan, New Jersey, or Mas-
sachusetts—was the impact that tech-
nology is having on jobs, both good and
bad, and potentially having both enor-
mous benefit and risk.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4534 June 12, 2019
Technology can be a huge benefit to
workers and communities alike, but it
also has the potential to displace or
eliminate jobs. California labor unions
have an impressive past of partnering
with industry to ensure that any dis-
ruption to the workforce, like tech-
nology, is done in coordination with
and in consultation with workers.
One major problem we face when try-
ing to assess whether automation will
be good or bad for our workforce is a
lack of data. This amendment simply
encourages the Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics to start collecting this important
data on the impact that technology is
having on our workforce. We can use
this data to inform policymaking to
fight for workers and the U.S. economy
and create programs and policies that
will support job creation, retention,
and the continued growth to our econ-
omy, but for everyone to benefit.
Similarly, this amendment would
allow for data collection on mass lay-
offs. We often hear arguments that
blame major job losses on regulations,
trade decisions, and other unsubstan-
tiated claims.
b 1615
With this data that we are asking
for, we will be able to collect and be
able to clearly and honestly evaluate
the effects of mass layoffs and how we
can avoid them, or at least how we can
help the workers who are affected.
The common theme for this amend-
ment is workforce protection. It is
something we agree about on both
sides, I believe. We want to create and
promote good-paying jobs for Ameri-
cans and protect those jobs that can be
and should be protected.
U.S. workers deserve our best efforts
to create policy that is in their best in-
terest. This amendment would help
give us the data to do just that, and at
no extra cost.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from California (Ms.
LEE), my friend and colleague.
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chairman,
let me thank my colleague and friend
from northern California, next door to
my district, for offering this amend-
ment and for his tremendous leadership
on so many issues relating to our
working men and women.
Mr. Chairman, I am concerned that a
decade of flat funding has left BLS in
critical condition, which is why the un-
derlying bill increases funding for BLS
by $61 million over the 2019 enacted
level. This investment will make up for
the loss of purchasing power and help
BLS take full advantage of advances in
statistical methods to promote the
high-quality statistics required for a
thriving 21st century economy. Ex-
panded capacity will allow BLS to bet-
ter examine critical issues such as job
loss due to automation, job loss due to
contracting, and mass layoffs.
Mr. Chairman, I appreciate this
amendment. It has drawn more atten-
tion to the importance of BLS, and I
am happy to support it.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I
ask for the House’s support. I think it
has been said over and over again that
information is power. In this instance,
this gives us the power to protect and
anticipate challenges to the American
workforce.
Mr. Chairman, I respectfully ask for
support for this amendment, and I
yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Chairman,
the bill before us today goes a long way
to improving the health of our country.
I thank the chairwoman for her leader-
ship and dedication to the health and
well-being of all Americans.
I am particularly pleased to see over
$6 billion in funding for the National
Cancer Institute. As we all know, prob-
ably too well, cancer affects all of us in
some way. All of us have a family
member, a friend, or a neighbor who
has had to go through the challenge of
being told they have cancer.
Nearly 1.8 million Americans will be
diagnosed with cancer in 2019. With re-
cent advancements, however, there has
never been a better time in history to
go through treatment if one has to be
diagnosed with cancer.
New treatments with ever-greater
outcomes are being developed con-
stantly, many of them at NCI. The re-
search done at NCI contributes to sav-
ing countless lives each year and helps
keep millions more healthy, including
myself as a cancer survivor of a form of
leukemia that, while not curable, is
manageable.
Because of the groundbreaking re-
search done at and funded by NCI, by
2016 there were over 15.5 million cancer
survivors in the United States alone.
By 2026, this number will go over 20
million survivors. However, despite the
high quality of care, many patients
lack the information they need to un-
derstand their treatment and be full
participants in their care.
As a cancer survivor, I am all too fa-
miliar with the uncertainty that fol-
lows the words, ‘‘you have cancer.’’
Doctors and health professionals start
talking at you, using terms you have
never heard, all of which matter, but
little of which you understand. Re-
search tells us that when someone is
told, and family members are told that
a family member has cancer, they only
retain one in four words.
While more than two-thirds of pa-
tients surveyed are satisfied with the
care they receive, the vast majority
lack knowledge about treatment, op-
tions, and details. In fact, a recent
study by NIH states that only 45 per-
cent of patients reported being ade-
quately informed about their diagnoses
when told they have cancer by their
physicians.
In a study in 2016, the Journal of
Clinical Oncology stated that 38 per-
cent of patients could never even re-
member talking with their doctor
about life expectancy.
Cancer treatment is complicated, and
I can tell you it is emotional for the
people who are being treated, for their
family, and for their loved ones. Yet 73
percent of patients do not search for
additional information about their di-
agnoses. That is why it is so important
that cancer care providers commu-
nicate clearly and often with patients
and survivors.
This amendment will set aside $1 mil-
lion for NCI to perform a study on how
to use best practices to improve com-
munications between cancer care pro-
viders and patients and survivors.
When people have the information they
need, they can more successfully navi-
gate treatment and life as a survivor.
A cancer diagnosis will always come
with uncertainty, but providers can
and must do more to communicate
clearly to help patients, their families
and friends, and survivors to fully un-
derstand their diagnosis, their treat-
ment, and their lifelong care expecta-
tions. It will allow patients to do what
patients should do: fight cancer.
I thank the cosponsors of my amend-
ment, Congressman BUDDY CARTER
from Georgia, who is also the co-chair
of the Cancer Survivors Caucus with
myself, and Congressman JAMIE
RASKIN, who is a member, for co-
authoring this amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from California (Ms.
LEE), my friend and my neighbor.
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chairman,
I thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup-
port of this amendment.
Lack of communication can lead to
barriers, it can prevent survivors from
restoring their quality of life, and real-
ly prevents patients, survivors, from
understanding all of their options and

I thank my colleague for sharing his
personal story to make sure that oth-
ers understand what is necessary and
using his experiences to help others.
The committee recognizes the leader-
ship of the National Cancer Institute’s
Office of Cancer Survivorship. The re-
port encourages the office to expand its
focus, in particular, on the needs of
childhood cancer survivors.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to vote ‘‘yes.’’ This is so important to
reduce the barriers to care.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I

The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I
am grateful for the support in this bill
for the Statewide Family Engagement
Center Program, and I also thank the
chair of this subcommittee for sup-
porting the program.
This is an extremely valuable pro-
gram that facilitates meaningful fam-
ily engagement for States, school dis-
tricts, schools, and parents to foster
positive school environments and im-
proved academic achievement.
Specifically, grantees are nonprofits
that carry out parent education and
provide comprehensive training and
technical assistance to schools to sup-
port family-school partnerships.
Research is clear that the more in-
volved families are in a student’s edu-
cation, the better the student per-
forms. If a parent understands the
value of the curriculum, develops rela-
tionships with teachers and adminis-
trators at their child’s school, and feels
involved in the local community as a
result, the student reaps the benefits.
I was proud that a bipartisan provi-
sion I authored with Congressman G.T.
THOMPSON led to the creation of State-
wide Family Engagement Centers.
Unfortunately, due to an administra-
tive oversight at the Department of
Education, a $1 million shortfall for fi-
nancial year 2019 has been created in
this program. If it is not fixed, current
grantees will have to cut their budgets
by 9 percent.
This shortfall will mean the 11 cen-
ters will have to cut staff or reduce
services. This will reduce the number
of families, States, schools, and school
districts that these centers can serve
in the 12 States across the country that
have grantees.
My amendment would make these de-
serving grantees whole and ensure that
students and their families continue to
receive the services they deserve to
help students thrive in and out of
school.
This amendment truly is an easy fix
to an unintended problem created by a
simple oversight. It is a commonsense
amendment.
I thank my friend, Mr. THOMPSON, for
working with us on this, and for his
support for this amendment and the
program.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to support the amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in op-
position, although I am not opposed to
the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5
minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend
from California for being such a tre-
mendous champion for this important
program and a great partner to work
with.
Mr. Chairman, the Statewide Family
Engagement Center Program provides
much-needed technical assistance and
partnership development to States and
school districts to foster meaningful
engagement with families to further
their children’s academic and develop-
mental progress.
Research has shown that family en-
gagement in a child’s education in-
creases student achievement, improves
attendance, reduces the dropout rate,
and advances the emotional and phys-
ical well-being of children.
Unfortunately, due to our Depart-
ment of Education grant reviewer
error, a $1 million shortfall for fiscal
year 2019 has been created in this pro-
gram. If this shortfall, this error, is not
filled, corrected, a 9 percent cut in the
grants of 11 centers serving 11 States
will take effect. This means that 11
centers will have to cut staff or reduce
services, including those who work
closely with parents.
While I was extremely pleased to see
an increase in funding in this program
in fiscal year 2020, we must ensure
these centers receive the funding they
deserve.
Our amendment would resolve this
shortfall by designating $1 million of
the $5 million increase under this bill
to ensure the current grantees are
made whole and can continue to pro-
vide the needed services and supports
to families in their States.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my fellow col-
leagues to vote in support of this
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
b 1630
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. LEE).
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chairman,
I rise in support of this amendment and
Statewide Family Engagement Cen-
ters. I thank the gentleman for offering
it.
This vital program helps States and
school districts implement evidence-
based family engagement strategies
that promote student success, includ-
ing programs that engage diverse fami-
lies and interventions that address spe-
cific parent needs. To expand these
proven practices, the underlying bill
increases the program by $5 million
over the 2019 enacted level.
However, I am aware of and con-
cerned by reports that a processing
error by the Department of Education
will cause reduced awards for existing
grantees, and I hope to work with my
colleagues in the Senate to address this
problem.
So I appreciate that the amendment
is drawing attention to the importance
of this program and this issue, and I
am very happy to support it.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Chair, I just
want to thank my colleague from
northern California, and I want to
thank my colleague from Pennsyl-
vania. It has been a pleasure working
with them when I was in the minority,
and it is a pleasure working with them
in the majority.
This really should be nonpartisan, bi-
partisan. It creates a real vehicle to
improve the quality of life for children
and families and schools, and I would
urge support for the amendment.

H4536 June 12, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 64, line 18, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(increased by $5,000,000) (reduced by
$5,000,000)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentleman

a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Chair, the bill
before us today goes a long way toward
improving the health of our country. I
commend the distinguished chair-
woman, once again, for her tireless
leadership for the health and well-
being of all Americans.
One particular area where increased
investments have been made in this
bill is mental health. I could not agree
more on the importance of addressing
this vital component to a person’s well-
being.
Mr. Chairman, at a time in our his-
tory where we are having trans-
formative interventions and innovation
in discoveries when it comes to mental
health, we have a challenge to provide
more infrastructure and more re-
sources. I have been told that we have
75 percent more requests for services in
behavioral health since the ACA was
passed with parity in it, but a 25 per-
cent decrease in the number of young
people going into professions.
So we clearly need to do more when
it comes to mental health, and there is
no place better to do more than with
young people, to get them involved in
understanding that there isn’t a stig-
ma, that, like cancer, behavioral
health and mental health should be ad-
dressed with evidence-based research,
and if people seek that kind of treat-
ment, they will be able to live full and
successful lives and will get away from
generations of stigma against people
who have legitimate behavioral health
issues that can be treated just as med-
ical treatments can.
According to the National Alliance
on Mental Illness, approximately one
in five adults in the United States—al-
most 50 million Americans—experience
mental illness in a given year. Millions
of children also suffer every year from
traumatic experience and mental ill-
ness.
Mr. Chair, approximately one in five
young people age 13 to 18—more than 21
percent—experience a severe mental
disorder; 13 percent of children age 8 to
15 experience a severe mental disorder
at some point in that timeframe; yet
only about 50 percent of children with
mental health conditions receive the
services they need.
Children who get the treatment and
support they need can learn to success-
fully control their symptoms, perform
better in school, and have better social
and emotional outcomes throughout
their lives.
When children go without treatment
and support, their symptoms can be-
come harder to control as they grow
older. In fact, adults who do not get
proper treatment as children face an
increased risk of having other chronic
conditions and die, on average, 25 years
earlier than others from preventable
causes—25 years because they are not
getting the treatment they need.
That is why it is so important that
we address mental illness at a young
age. Children and their families must
know that it is okay to ask for help
and should be taught where to look.
My amendment would improve access
to mental health support for children
in a school-based environment to meet
students’ needs onsite. This funding
will help children who might not other-
wise get mental healthcare get the sup-
port they need in a setting they know
and trust.
NIH research shows that children
promoted to the next grade increases
by almost 13 percent and the average
number of days children are suspended
decreases significantly as children par-
ticipate in mental health services of-
fered at their schools.
Our teachers are already underpaid
and overworked, and many teachers re-
port that they are the first and only
support children receive for their men-
tal and behavioral health problems. By
increasing services to students directly
in schools, we can help reduce the men-
tal healthcare crisis and decrease the
stigma at the same time.
I urge passage of this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from California (Ms.
LEE), my friend and colleague.
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chair, I
thank the gentleman for yielding and
say, once again, that I rise in strong
support of this amendment.
In any given year, the percentage of
young people with mental, emotional,
and behavioral disorders is estimated
to be between 14 and 20 percent.
These disorders among young people
interfere with their ability to accom-
plish developmental tasks, such as
healthy interpersonal relationships,
succeeding in school, and, ultimately,
transitioning into the workforce. Also,
early signs of difficulties can help pre-
vent violent outbreaks at school.
Now, as a clinical social worker by
profession and chair of the Social Work
Caucus here in the House of Represent-
atives, I know the importance of ad-
dressing the mental health needs of our
children where they are, and that is at
school.
I am proud that the underlying bill
that we are considering includes an in-
crease of $13 million for Project
AWARE, which supports mental health
strategies in schools.
School-based mental health needs,
including training for school personnel
to recognize the signs and symptoms of
mental health issues, are critically im-
portant to identifying and referring
children to services.
Mr. Chair, I again thank Congress-
man DESAULNIER and urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amend-
ment.

back the balance of my time.

The Chair recognizes the gentle-

Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today to offer a commonsense amend-
ment that will allow the courts, rather
than the majority in the House, to de-
cide the fate of a proposed rule set
forth by the Department of Health and
Human Services.
In February of this year, HHS issued
a new rule that would restrict Title X
family planning grants from going to
entities that are not physically and fi-
nancially separated from abortion pro-
viders. But a series of court injunctions
have frozen these new rule changes
and, as a result, hundreds of Planned
Parenthood facilities nationwide are
still receiving Federal tax dollars.
Americans have made it clear time
and time again that they don’t want
their tax dollars paying for abortions.
This rule, which prevents any tax
dollars from going to any abortion-pro-
viding facility, is going through the
constitutional challenges of our judi-
cial process. Unfortunately, lawmakers
here in the House have chosen to tie
the hands of HHS through legislation
by effectively stating that the HHS
Secretary may only act in accordance
of ‘‘regulations and instructions’’ es-
tablished before January 18, 2017, just 2
days before Donald Trump became
President.
My amendment would strike that
provision, allowing the U.S. courts to
decide if HHS’ proposed rule should
stand.
We cannot handcuff the current ad-
ministration to regulations of past ad-
ministrations, and I ask my colleagues
to support my amendment.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4537
June 12, 2019
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I claim the
time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Connecticut is recognized for 5
minutes.
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, this bill
includes a provision prohibiting the
implementation of the administra-
tion’s damaging new rule for the Title
X Family Planning program. It is often
referred to as the domestic gag rule.
The administration’s domestic gag rule
is an ideological assault on family
planning services.
The Title X Family Planning pro-
gram is the only Federal program that
provides quality, affordable, com-
prehensive, preventive, and reproduc-
tive healthcare services in every single
State. Title X clinics serve more than
4 million women and men each year at
4,000 health clinics across every State.
Over two-thirds of the patients who
seek care at Title X clinics are in a
household that is at or below the pov-
erty level. Many of these patients are
uninsured or underinsured.
To be clear, the Title X program does
not provide funding for abortions, de-
spite what the others may be saying.
However, the proposed rule would
make clinics that use non-Federal
funding to provide abortions or even
referrals for abortions ineligible for
funding.
The proposed rule also eliminates the
requirement that grantees provide non-
directive pregnancy options coun-
seling. That means grantees can simply
refuse to offer complete and accurate
information to patients.
The rule also allows grantees to
refuse to give referrals to patients or
even give misleading information to
patients when they request a referral.
When patients can no longer rely on
their healthcare provider to share full
and accurate information with them or
to refer them to other care when nec-
essary or when they request it, then
the provider-patient relationship has
been broken.
We need to trust women. We need to
respect women to make choices that
are best for themselves and for their
families, and we must support pro-
viders to offer medically accurate in-
formation to patients.
This bill’s provision to block the do-
mestic gag rule is critical to maintain-
ing support for healthcare providers of-
fering evidence-based preventive and
reproductive healthcare across the
country.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
oppose this amendment, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Chair, I reserve the
balance of my time.
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, may I in-
quire as to how much time I have re-
maining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Connecticut has 23⁄4 minutes re-
maining.
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Florida (Ms. FRANKEL).
Ms. FRANKEL. Mr. Chair, my, my,
my, here we go again, the anti-abortion
obsession turned into more cruel ridic-
ulousness.
How interesting that my Republican
colleagues, whose motto is ‘‘less gov-
ernment,’’ try at every opportunity to
interfere with a woman’s most personal
decision whether or not to bring a child
into the world.
But this amendment does more than
that. It is aimed at eviscerating
Planned Parenthood and like clinics,
cutting off access to contraception and
lifesaving healthcare to millions of
Americans.
Women and the people they trust—
not politicians—must be in charge of
women’s reproductive destinies, which
means that women must have access to
full healthcare, because we will not go
back to the days of coat hanger medi-
cine.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
defeat this very, very bad, bad, bad,
bad, very bad amendment.
b 1645
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, let me just
repeat: Over two-thirds of the patients
who seek care at Title X clinics are in
a household that is at or below the pov-
erty level. Many of these patients are
uninsured and underinsured.
We are looking at the opportunity for
healthcare screenings in 4,000 clinics
around this country, which is what we
want to do. That is not happening be-
cause of some ideological assault on
family planning, again, someone’s per-
sonal beliefs being foisted on millions
of people around the country. That is
not the job we came here to do.
Our job is to be able to have people
get the kinds of services that they
need, to be told where they can go to
get those services, to make the refer-
rals on healthcare that they need. This
is not one’s own personal view of what
someone else’s healthcare needs are.
Fundamentally, at the root of all of
this is a distrust and a lack of respect
for the decisions that women make on
behalf of themselves and their families.
Let’s trust women. They know what
is good for themselves and their fami-
lies, not 435 people who sit in this body
who have their own personal religious
beliefs.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Chair, I have no
other speakers, and I am prepared to
close.
I am unapologetically pro-life, and I
will continue to use this platform and
every opportunity it provides to stand
up for those who cannot defend them-
selves.
Congress must ensure that our con-
stituents’ tax dollars are not being
used to end innocent lives. This is our
enduring responsibility.
Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to
please support this amendment, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. ROBY).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.
Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Chair, I demand a re-
corded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentlewoman from Alabama will be
postponed.

to consider amendment No. 10 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.

sert ‘‘(reduced by $1,000,000)’’.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. WATERS) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, my amend-
ment simply removes $1 million from
the Administration for Children and
Families programs account, but it re-
places it back in the very same ac-
count. My intent in doing this is to
highlight an issue for my colleagues
and for the Department of Health and
Human Services.
Before I go into detail on this, I want
everyone to know that I was one of the
early participants in the Head Start
program as an assistant teacher. I was
there when Head Start was first devel-
oped under the Federal poverty pro-
gram.
I love Head Start. I understand it
very thoroughly, and I wish that every
child that needed the advantages of
this program could have it and benefit
from it.
In California alone, the Head Start
program serves over 100,000 children.
Nationwide, more than 1 million chil-
dren and families across the country
rely on its essential services.
However, children and families can’t
receive the care and valuable benefits
of Head Start if we aren’t strategic in
determining the organizations and
communities that receive aid.
When Federal auditors determine
whether a Head Start program must re-
compete for funding, they compare the
metrics of a program against national
averages. However, a successful pro-
gram operating within an urban com-
munity must be defined differently
than one operating in the suburbs or a
rural community. Comparing providers
to national averages disadvantages
those with fewer resources and more
obstacles to success.
In my own district, the 43rd Congres-
sional District of California, there have
been six Head Start organizations that
serve predominantly minority commu-
nities that have lost their funding in

favor of organizations operating in
more affluent areas.
I fear these closures in Los Angeles
may be indicative of a nationwide
trend. There are also reports of Head
Start programs serving minority com-
munities in Detroit, Michigan, and Lit-
tle Rock, Arkansas, that have been
forced to recompete because they did
not rank high enough when compared
to programs nationwide.
Instead of helping struggling pro-
grams improve, which would ensure
that families living in those commu-
nities still receive uninterrupted Head
Start services, this recompete process
forces providers to divert resources
from programmatic priorities to ad-
ministrative costs associated with
competing for Federal grant dollars.
This only compounds the difficulties
faced by the Head Start provider.
The result of this process may be
that affluent Head Start providers are
better able to navigate the bureau-
cratic system HHS has created while
those providers struggling to overcome
obstacles, such as funding deficiencies
and higher teacher turnover rates, are
shut down.
Further oversight is required. The
Department of Health and Human
Services should comprehensively exam-
ine its Head Start selection and evalua-
tion process for any evidence that such
processes are having a disparate im-
pact on either the minority commu-
nities that the programs serve or on
minority-operated Head Start pro-
grams.
HHS should submit a report to Con-
gress no later than January 1 of 2020—
and I am going to be working on that—
on its findings and any changes nec-
essary to remedy the effects of such
disparate impacts on communities of
color. We must do everything possible
to ensure that all children, not merely
the ones who happened to live in afflu-
ent communities near a well-funded
Head Start provider, have access to the
support services they need.
Although I will be withdrawing this
amendment, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support a comprehensive
audit of the Head Start application,
evaluation, and recompete processes.
Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I thank
my friend for yielding. She is a loyal
champion for her constituents, for the
children who benefit from the high-
quality early childhood education and
services that Head Start offers, and for
the business owners in her district.
We want to hold these facilities to
high standards. The recompete process
needs to be sensitive to the needs of
the communities that rely on these
services.
I promise to work closely with Rep-
resentative WATERS and ACF to con-
duct the proper oversight that this
issue deserves.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I would
simply like to say that I think that the
processes that we are examining have
unintended consequences that we think
we can straighten out.
I thank Congresswoman DELAURO for
her support in taking a look at this
issue. We will be working together.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time, and I withdraw the amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The amendment
is withdrawn.

Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Chair,
Lyme disease is the most prevalent
vector-borne disease in the United
States today.
If not diagnosed and treated prop-
erly, Lyme can lead to disseminated
infection that can affect every system
in the body, including the central nerv-
ous system. Later symptoms of Lyme
include neurological problems, memory
loss, brain fog, and heart systems such
as heart block and inflammation of the
heart muscle.
Lyme has been reported in every
State in the United States. My State,
for example, has a particularly high in-
cidence of new cases and old, about
50,000 new infections each year.
While grossly undercounted for dec-
ades, new scientific evidence shows
that the number of new cases of Lyme
is now estimated to be between 291,000
to 437,000. Remember, these are new
cases of Lyme disease.
Since 1998, Mr. Chair, I have intro-
duced comprehensive legislation on
tick-borne diseases, including Lyme.
At the core of it was the creation of a
working group or a blue-ribbon com-
mission to try to figure out what is
going on and to have Lyme-literate
participants because there has been a
culture of denial about Lyme disease,
particularly chronic Lyme, for decades.
With the support and strategic help
of Republican Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY,
we succeeded in our goal and added the
Tick-Borne Disease Working Group to
the 21st Century Cures Act. I am
thankful to FRED UPTON, as well, for
his leadership on this important initia-
tive.
I would point out that that Working
Group was dead over in the Senate, and
again, it was KEVIN MCCARTHY who
said the 21st Century Cures Act doesn’t
come back unless that is in it. That
made it happen.
The Working Group is charged with
reviewing current research efforts and
identifying the gaps in the study, edu-
cation, prevention, and access to care
for patients with Lyme and other tick-
borne diseases.
In their inaugural report to Congress,
the Working Group said, ‘‘Americans
need help, yet progress has been ham-
pered by a lack of attention at the Fed-
eral level and by divisions within the
field.’’ I include the executive sum-
mary of the Working Group’s report in
the RECORD.
[Tick-Borne Disease Working Group, 2018
Report to Congress]
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Tick-Borne Diseases have rapidly become a
serious and growing threat to public health
in the United States. Despite many scientific
unknowns, experts agree that the incidence
and distribution of tick-borne diseases are
increasing. Over the past 25 years, reports of
Lyme disease have increased steadily with
estimated annual cases approximating
300,000 (Hinckley et al., 2014; Nelson et al.,
2015 ). The number of U.S. counties now con-
sidered to be of high incidence for Lyme dis-
ease has increased by more than 300% in the
Northeastern states and by approximately
250% in the North-Central states. The Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) currently recognizes 18 tick-borne
pathogens in the United States. However, re-
searchers and health care practitioners con-
tinue to discover emerging disease agents
and new medical conditions associated with
tick bites.
While most Lyme disease patients who are
diagnosed and treated early can fully re-
cover, 10 to 20% of patients suffer from per-
sistent symptoms, which for some are chron-
ic and disabling. Studies indicate that Lyme
disease costs approximately $1.3 billion each
year in direct medical costs alone in the
United States. A comprehensive under-
standing of the full economic and societal
cost remains unknown. It is likely orders of
magnitude higher and potentially a $50- to
$100-billion-dollar problem for the United
States, although more research is needed
(Vanderhoof & Vanderhoof-Forschner, 1993;
Zhang et al., 2006).
Prompt diagnosis and treatment of tick-
borne diseases are crucial to prevent long-
term complications. Today, available diag-
nostic tests can be inaccurate and complex
to interpret, especially during the earliest
stage of infection when treatment is most ef-
fective. Unlike in other infectious disease
settings, tests to directly measure the pres-
ence of the infecting organism, such as cul-
tures or tissue biopsies, are not available for
some tick-borne diseases such as Lyme dis-
ease. This leaves physicians without the
tools needed to diagnose; and without an ac-
curate diagnosis, it is challenging for physi-
cians to provide early treatment.
Persistent symptoms after treatment of
Lyme disease can be severe, yet their
cause(s) remains unknown and debated.
There are currently no uniformly accepted
or validated treatment options for patients
with these chronic symptoms. As a result,
uncertainty surrounding appropriate clinical
care has led to polarization within the med-
ical community, and patients are often left
suffering in limbo without a clear path to ill-
ness resolution or even symptom manage-
ment (Rebman et al., 2017). The lack of a
clear path for treatment of persistent symp-
toms in some patients with Lyme disease

and other tick-borne diseases not only am-
plifies patient suffering but also signifi-
cantly increases health care costs.
This report outlines an integrated,
multipronged approach to the growing public
health challenges posed by tick-borne dis-
eases in the United States. It contains nine
main chapters, including Background; Meth-
ods; Epidemiology and Ecology; Prevention;
Diagnosis; Treatment; Access to Care, Pa-
tient Outcomes; Looking Forward; and Con-
clusion. The Background and Methods chap-
ters explain how the report was developed.
The other chapters present the main chal-
lenges, key issues, and recommendations
specific to the broader topics.
To understand tick-borne diseases, we need
to first understand tick ecology and how
ticks transmit diseases. Due to the lack of a
coordinated national surveillance program,
currently there are significant gaps in infor-
mation on local distribution of infection-
causing ticks, especially in regions beyond
the Northeast and Upper Midwest. Nation-
wide, standardized approaches for tick, ani-
mal, and human surveillance are needed to
understand the geographic distribution of in-
fectious ticks in order to understand the
spread of disease and predict where people
are at risk. Advanced technologies and sys-
tematic studies are also needed to rapidly
identify new disease agents that pose emer-
gent risks to public health, including to the
blood supply. Given that seven new tick-
borne pathogens have been shown to infect
people in the United States since 2004,this is
a priority.
Effective prevention relies on multi-
pronged strategies. To reduce exposure to
ticks, we need a comprehensive under-
standing of the biological drivers behind the
continued spread of tick-borne diseases, so
that effective tick- and infection control
methods can be identified and validated.
Need also exists for the transparent develop-
ment of a safe, effective human vaccine to
prevent Lyme disease, the most common of
these illnesses. In the absence of effective
strategies for controlling ticks and blocking
the transmission of tick-borne pathogens, it
is crucial to educate health care leadership
are needed to reverse the alarming profes-
sionals and the public about tick-borne dis-
ease prevention, especially best practices for
protection from tick bites. Outreach efforts
to promote prevention and raise awareness
among physicians and the public must be ex-
panded at both the Federal and state level to
ensure accurate, effective, and consistent
messaging.
Clinical research priorities must include
the development of new technologies and ap-
proaches to improve diagnosis of tick-borne
diseases and monitor response to treatment.
There is a critical need for sensitive and spe-
cific direct-pathogen detection strategies
that are broad enough to cover multiple po-
tential tickborne pathogens. Understanding
the etiology and pathogenesis of ongoing
symptoms after initial treatment should be a
clinical research priority. Investigations are
also needed into the potential roles of
immunologic responses, bacterial persist-
ence, and coinfecting pathogens in order to
design and test new therapies and, ulti-
mately, improve outcomes and care for pa-
tients with ongoing symptoms.
Americans need help, yet progress has been
hampered by a lack of attention at the Fed-
eral level and by divisions within the field.
The recommendations in this 2018 report of
the TickBorne Disease Working Group rep-
resent a longterm investment in tackling the
rise of tick-borne diseases in this country.
However, immediate changes are also re-
quired to help patients already suffering
from tick-borne diseases; to protect them
from discrimination; and to address the in-
flexible, inconsistent, and often unaffordable
care that patients frequently encounter in
the current health care system.
Increaseed Federal funding, prioritzation,
and leadership are needed to reverse the
alarming trends associated with tick-borne
diseases. Despite several decades of research,
prevention, and educational activities, Fed-
eral funding for tick-borne diseases is less
per new surveillance case than that of other
diseases. The U.S. National Institutes of
Health (NIH) and CDC spend $77,355 and
$20,293, respectively, per new surveillance
case of HIV/AIDS, and $36,063 and $11,459 per
new case of hepatitis C virus, yet only $768
and $302 for each new case of Lyme disease.
Federal funding for tick-borne diseases
today is orders of magnitude lower, com-
pared to other public health threats, and it
has failed to increase as the problem has
grown.
It is also essential that funding and re-
sources be allocated to support a comprehen-
sive, interagency program to address the
mounting challenges identified in this re-
port. All research, prevention, and education
initiatives should be inclusive of special pop-
ulations such as children, who suffer dis-
proportionately from tick-borne diseases.
Patients whose lives continue to be dis-
rupted by the lasting effects of these ill-
nesses are counting on emerging scientific
research, evidence-based policy, and the
health care establishment—including the
Federal Government with Congressional and
Executive leadership—to provide solutions.
We must act now.’
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Chair,
much of what we have argued about for
a quarter of a century has now been
scientifically validated by the Working
Group, including the fact that massive
numbers of people are getting seriously
ill from ticks and that the Federal re-
sponse has been woefully inadequate.
Let me point out to my colleagues
that this amendment very simply
boosts the amount of money that CDC
will have to spend. Again, it was the
Working Group that pointed out that
in terms of prevalence, the number of
diseases that are charted, no other dis-
ease, no other disability gets less fund-
ing for CDC or for NIH. I would say
that is because there has been such a
culture of denial by certain organiza-
tions about the prevalence of Lyme
over the years, and that has really pre-
vented the necessary work from hap-
pening.
We are talking about, in 2017, $11 mil-
lion for CDC and $28 million for the Na-
tional Institutes of Health. That is a
drop in the bucket for this infectious
disease.
CDC has recognized that there are 18
tick-borne pathogens in the U.S., and
researchers and healthcare practi-
tioners continue to discover emerging
agents.
The Working Group’s report was able
to underscore a fact many of us have
believed to be true, and now it is fur-
ther validated, that 10 to 20 percent of
patients suffer from persistent symp-
toms, which are chronic and dis-
abling—in other words, chronic Lyme.
The diagnostic tests—and this is,
again, where the research dollars can
make a difference—are also often inac-
curate. The report points out that in
about 50 percent or more of the cases,
when people do blood tests they are
told they don’t have it. Those are false
negatives. They do have it.
There are other tests that go deeper
into the bands to discover this. It is
very expensive. We need a world-class
diagnostic tool.
Mr. Chair, I would point out to my
colleagues that the disproportionate
number of people who are infected—
mal infected, to be more accurate—are
children who are out in the backyard.
This report points out that most people
get Lyme in their own backyards. Of
course, if people play sports, are
hikers, or are out in the wilderness,
they are also further at risk.
b 1700
So this amendment increases CDC’s
funding it by $1 million for Lyme. It is
a modest amount but a step in the
right direction.
I have also introduced legislation
with COLLIN PETERSON, and I would ask
my colleagues to take a look at it. It is
called the TICK Act, H.R. 3073, and it
would create a national strategy like
we have done with Alzheimer’s and like
we have done with other diseases to
bring the needed Federal resources to
the fight against Lyme.
Mr. Chairman, I do ask Members to
support the amendment and take a
look at the TICK Act.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chairman, I
claim the time in opposition, although
I do not oppose the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Ms. DELAURO. I support this amend-
ment, Mr. Chairman. I know the gen-
tleman is a longtime supporter of in-
creased funding for the CDC’s Lyme
disease program. I commend him for
his continued efforts to address this
issue, and I thank him for appearing
before this subcommittee on Member
Day to talk about the importance of
this issue.
I have a particular interest in this ef-
fort as well as the Lyme disease was
discovered in Lyme, Connecticut, so I
know all about the illness.
The underlying bill does include a $1
million increase. It is a total funding
level of $13 million for the CDC to in-
tensify efforts to develop better
diagnostics and to bolster critical pre-
vention and surveillance networks,
which are critically important as Lyme
disease is being reported in every sin-
gle State. This amendment would in-
crease the program by an additional $1
million. And I do know from reviewing
the amendments that are coming up in
the next several hours that there, in
fact, is another Lyme disease amend-
ment.
So, Mr. Chairman, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of
my time.

Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I
rise in support of this amendment to
protect construction and shipyard
workers from exposure to beryllium, an
ultra-toxic metal. When beryllium dust
is inhaled, it can trigger chronic beryl-
lium disease, an irreversible lung dis-
ease that suffocates victims and often
leads to a painful death. Beryllium is
also a known human carcinogen.
For decades the Federal Government
has relied on an arbitrary standard cre-
ated in 1948 to limit workers’ exposure
to beryllium.
In January 2017, after almost 20 years
of consideration, OSHA issued a stand-
ard that cut permissible worker expo-
sure levels by 90 percent for general in-
dustry, construction, and maritime
workers, and improved early detection
of beryllium-related health effects
through medical monitoring. But this
victory was short-lived. Less than a
year later OSHA moved to weaken pro-
tections against exposure to beryllium
for 11,500 maritime and construction
workers.
This is the first time in its nearly 50-
year history that OSHA has proposed
to roll back an existing worker health
protection for a substance known to
cause cancer. While keeping lower ex-
posure limits, the new OSHA proposal
would eliminate vital ancillary provi-
sions that protect workers from beryl-
lium.
If this proposal is finalized, workers
would have no way of knowing if they
are being exposed to harmful levels of
airborne beryllium. Worse still, work-
ers would have no way of knowing if
they or their employers need to take
measures to address a beryllium-re-
lated disease or adverse health effect.
OSHA’s unprecedented move ignores
scientific evidence showing that, even
with the 90 percent reduction in the ex-
posure limits, there remains a signifi-
cant risk to worker health from beryl-
lium, and when a significant health
risk remains, the courts have affirmed
that OSHA should maintain ancillary
requirements.
Furthermore, OSHA has presented no
evidence that construction and mari-
time workers are at any less risk of be-
ryllium-related diseases than general
industry workers. Nonetheless, the
agency’s proposal would discriminate
against construction and maritime
workers by leaving them with inferior
protections compared to general indus-
try workers.
Finally, OSHA’s unprecedented ac-
tion was not based on science or evi-
dence that the ancillary requirements
were not feasible. Construction compa-
nies and shipyards across the country
already implement other OSHA stand-
ards with ancillary provisions for toxic
metals such as chromium, cadmium,
and arsenic.
Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this
amendment to protect construction
and maritime workers, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I
claim the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Michigan is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, while
I appreciate my friend and colleague
from Virginia and his concern about
this issue, I have to oppose the amend-
ment because it would prevent the ad-
ministration from continuing its im-
portant work to finalize proposed rules
to examine the exposure limits for be-
ryllium in construction and shipyard
industries.
Mr. Chairman, regulations to protect
worker health are vital and necessary;
however, all voices should be heard
through proper notice and comment pe-
riod. Unfortunately, in the last days of
the previous administration, OSHA ex-
panded its 2017 final rule without al-
lowing for proper notice and comment
from many impacted industries.
The public comment period is an es-
sential part of upholding our demo-
cratic values because it ensures that
Americans will have their voices heard
in the Federal Government’s regu-
latory process. People need to have the
confidence that Federal agencies are
open to their insights and constructive
criticism and that their concerns will
not be circumvented at the last
minute.
So I encourage Members to oppose
this amendment and allow OSHA to get
back to work to issue a regulation that
has undergone the proper review and
protects the health of workers.
Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he
may consume to Mr. COMER.
Mr. COMER. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to
this amendment and its circumventing
of the administration’s ability to con-
duct the rulemaking process. This
amendment would deny OSHA the abil-
ity to finalize its proposed rule which
is aimed at correcting the previous ad-
ministration’s failure to produce a tar-
geted final rule that reflected input
from stakeholders.
OSHA’s current proposed rule is nec-
essary to aid in clarifying standards for
the shipyard and construction indus-
tries. Further delay would unneces-
sarily burden these businesses and cre-
ate continued significant compliance
costs that we cannot know the full
scope of today because proper analysis
was never conducted during the rule-
making process of the previous admin-
istration.
In order for a tailored, adequately
prescriptive rule to emerge, OSHA
must be able to deliver an updated
standard that responds to the input of
the hardworking individuals in these
sectors.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to join me in opposing this amend-
ment.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chairman, I rise
in support of this amendment. This is
about protecting existing beryllium
standards established by the Occupa-
tional Safety and Health Administra-
tion for construction and maritime
workers.
Any effort to weaken or revoke the
2017 rule limiting exposure to beryl-
lium would reflect the first time that
OSHA has proposed to weaken a stand-
ard protecting workers against a
known human carcinogen. It leaves
construction and shipyard workers vul-
nerable to life-threatening beryllium-
related diseases and increases their
risk of developing lung cancer.
I appreciate that the amendment is
drawing attention to the importance of
strengthening—not weakening—worker
health and safety standards. This is
about saving people’s lives.
Mr. Chairman, how can you be op-
posed and support bureaucracy versus
saving people’s lives?
I am so happy to support this amend-
ment.
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself the balance of my
time.
Mr. Chairman, OSHA did not origi-
nally propose to cover shipyards or
construction, but asked about coverage
in its proposal, it was extensively dis-
cussed during the comment period, and
those comments are noted in the Fed-
eral Register, Volume 80, Number 152,
page 47569.
I would hope that we would protect
the shipyard and construction workers

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentleman

ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Oregon.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup-
port of this amendment to preserve the
Job Corps Civilian Conservation Cen-
ter, CCC, program.
Last month the Trump administra-
tion, in a shortsighted manner, an-
nounced plans to permanently close
nine of the centers and hand the re-
maining 16 facilities over to private
contractors by the end of the year.
This is an incredibly successful pro-
gram. They have a unique mandate
within Job Corps to help conserve, de-
velop, manage public natural resources
and areas and to respond to natural
disasters. The 25 CCCs operate in 17 na-
tional forests and grasslands across 16
States and train thousands of at-risk
youth every year.
Many of these young adults, being at
risk, come from rural communities,
and these programs provide them with
cutting-edge vocational training and
pathways out of poverty in addition to
providing critical opportunities to
struggling rural areas.
Beyond this, CCCs provide essential
capacity for the Forest Service to ful-
fill its mission. During the height of
the 2017 fire season, 1,200 students pro-
vided 450,000 hours of wildfire support,
and after Hurricane Harvey, the stu-
dents provided 5,000 hours of support to
impacted communities.
This is wrong for our rural commu-
nities, wrong for the Forest Service,
and it is wrong to abandon at-risk
youth by killing this program. Now is
the wrong time to be reducing capac-
ity.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to join me in support of this amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I rise in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
is recognized for 5 minutes.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, Job Corps is meant to be an
outlet to help disadvantaged youth
gain the skills necessary to achieve a
good education and the skills needed
for the workforce, but the failures of
the program do a disservice to stu-
dents, staff, and the American tax-
payers who pay for the programs.
For years this federally funded pro-
gram has struggled to ensure the safe-
ty and security of students. There is
ample documentation about the sys-
temic deficiencies in Job Corps, and
over 30 different government reports
and audits have raised concerns over
the safety and security of participants.
The administration’s proposed
changes to Job Corps are an important
first step in reforming the program so
that it actually works for students and
efficiently utilizes taxpayer funds.
The Department of Labor’s mission
of preparing at-risk youth for meaning-
ful participation in the workforce and
skills development for career success
makes them a better choice for run-
ning the 25 Job Corps Centers that have
previously been operated by USDA.
The transition of these Civilian Con-
servation Centers, or CCCs, will allow
USDA to strengthen its focus on im-
proving our Nation’s forests and grass-
lands while also remaining a key part-
ner in the DOL-run Job Corps centers
going forward.
In short, the administration’s efforts
would allow more students to partici-
pate in the Job Corps program at high
performing centers and in doing so pro-
tect taxpayer money.
I urge my colleagues to support a Job
Corps program that actually protects
and serves students and to vote ‘‘no’’
on this amendment.

Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Oregon
(Mr. SCHRADER).
Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Chair, I rise
today to urge support for this impor-
tant bipartisan amendment.
The Job Corps Civilian Conservation
Centers program provides valuable
services to get at-risk young adults the
skills they need to succeed. I would re-
peat that: This is a very successful pro-
gram with phenomenal results. To turn
our back on these kids is unconscion-
able.
It is an extremely successful pro-
gram, training thousands in a variety
of tasks, like working on rural infra-
structure projects, maintaining our na-
tional forests, and being a frontline
member for our natural disaster relief
teams.
Wildfire season has already started
out West. We need these services to en-
hance our brave first-responder teams.
As pointed out by the chairman, these
folks were invaluable during the 2017
fire season, providing the equivalent of
450,000 hours of service, leveraging our
tax dollars in a great way.
I have heard from a number of con-
stituents and groups in my district
that are worried about the future of
these young people, like the Angell
CCC on our Oregon coast.
This is a callous approach by the ad-
ministration.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment and push back
against this ill-thought-out plan.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Ms. DELAURO).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4542 June 12, 2019
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I rise in
support of this amendment, which re-
jects the administration’s plan to ter-
minate the joint partnership between
the Department of Agriculture and the
Department of Labor that governs the
operation of the Job Corps Civilian
Conservation Centers.
The Trump administration wants to
turn its back on disconnected and vul-
nerable youth, especially those who de-
pend on Job Corps programs in rural
communities. These centers give dis-
advantaged young people valuable, on-
the-job experience and training, put-
ting them on a path to a good job while
learning about how to conserve and
protect our natural resources.
As a matter of fact, of the top-per-
forming 15 centers, 6 were Civilian Con-
servation Centers.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
vote in favor of this bipartisan amend-
ment.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Georgia
(Mr. BISHOP).
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
rise as a cosponsor of this amendment,
which would prohibit closure of the
U.S. Forest Service Job Corps Civilian
Conservation Centers.
Closing the Job Corps Civilian Con-
servation Centers makes absolutely no
sense. These 25 centers are among the
highest-performing centers in the
country. Despite claims to the con-
trary, they contribute directly to the
missions of the U.S. Department of Ag-
riculture and the U.S. Forest Service
by training thousands of students each
year in conservation work and fire-
fighting.
At a time when the Forest Service
has been struggling to hire dispatchers
and firefighters to prepare for the up-
coming fire season, it is irresponsible,
to say the least, to close these centers
and lay off 1,100 Job Corps employees.
Mr. Chair, as the co-chair of the bi-
partisan Job Corps Congressional Cau-
cus with Congressman PHIL ROE, I ap-
plaud Representatives DEFAZIO and
NEWHOUSE for their outstanding efforts
to stop the U.S. Department of Labor
and the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture from going forward with this
reckless and ill-advised decision.
Mr. Chair, I urge support for this
amendment.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I continue to reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chair, may I ask
for the remaining time on either side.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon has 30 seconds remaining.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self 30 seconds.
I doubt the gentlewoman has ever
visited one of these programs. I have,
numerous times. I have seen the hot-
shot teams. These kids are so proud.
They were on a bad path, and now they
are on a good path.
So, if you want to talk about at-risk
youth, if you want to end up having
them get on drugs and go to jail, kill
the program. If you don’t kill the pro-
gram, we are going to save these kids’
lives and make them into productive
citizens.
On the plane one day, I sat next to a
guy just coming back from one in
Idaho. He had learned to cook there. He
got his certificate. He was offered four
jobs when he came back. Before that,
he was a dead-end kid with no high
school degree.
These programs have great results
for these youth. Do not be cruel and
kill it.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, could I inquire as to how much
time I have remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from North Carolina has 3 minutes re-
maining.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, au contraire, to the gentleman
from Oregon. Not only have I visited
one of these programs but when I was
president of the Mayland Community
College, we had a program very close
by. I am very well aware of these pro-
grams.
I doubt the gentleman from Oregon
has ever read the report, which talks
about the ineptness, the lack of safety,
and the danger in these programs.
The dangerous place that these pro-
grams are, the number of deaths that
have occurred in Job Corps programs,
yes, there are phenomenal results.
There are phenomenally bad results in
these programs.
Mr. Chair, we have 7 million jobs un-
filled in this country right now. If Job
Corps, along with our colleges and uni-
versities, were doing their jobs in this
country, we wouldn’t have 7 million
jobs vacant in the country. We would
have more people prepared with the
skills they need to fill those jobs.
The recommendation made by the ad-
ministration will allow more students
to get the skills they need at a lower
cost for the American taxpayers and in
higher-performing centers. We need to
spend the scarce dollars that we have
as wisely as possible.
These programs are more in line with
the mission of DOL than in line with
the mission of the Department of Agri-
culture. We need to allow the Depart-
ment of Agriculture to focus on its
mission and the Department of Labor
to focus on its mission.
I have all the sympathy in the world
for young, disadvantaged people who do
not have skills to get jobs, Mr. Chair. I
have worked directly with those peo-
ple. I have helped many of them. This
is not the way to go. If we truly want
to help them, we will have effective
programs, not dangerous programs and
not ineffective programs.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chair, as the
designee of the gentlewoman from
Texas, I move to strike the last word.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Washington is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chair, I rise in
support of the amendment that I intro-
duced with my friend from Oregon (Mr.
DEFAZIO) to prevent Federal funds
from being used to close or transfer the
operations of the U.S. Forest Service
Job Corps Civilian Conservation Cen-
ters.
Mr. Chair, I am a strong supporter of
this administration’s demonstrated
commitment to rural prosperity for
communities often ignored or forgotten
across this country. Their focus on pro-
moting policies to protect rural com-
munities is so important to regions of
the country like my own district of
central Washington.
Unfortunately, the recent proposal to
close many Forest Service Job Corps
facilities and remove the Forest Serv-
ice-based mission from the remaining
centers will hurt rural America.
It is for this reason that I have been
working with a bipartisan coalition of
Members from across the country, both
in the House and in the Senate, to pre-
vent this proposal from moving for-
ward.
The three centers in central and east-
ern Washington are critical to sup-
porting our rural communities, which
are on the front lines of facing ever-
worsening impacts of catastrophic
wildfires.
I have met the students who aid ac-
tive management efforts in our Na-
tion’s forests and help restore commu-
nities devastated by wildfires. The pub-
lic service they provide is worthy of
our support.

ices, mentoring, certification programs,
textbooks and curricula.
DOL’s planned Job Corps center closures
stand to impact more than 43 construction
training programs, six of which are operated
by HBI at three of the affected locations.
Many of these centers serve rural and dis-
located communities and have enrollment
numbers exceeding national and regional
averages. However, the Department of Labor
has not disclosed any performance metrics or
data to support its closure determinations
and it has provided little information on how
it will continue to serve the thousands of at-
risk youth who will be displaced from their
local centers. Further, DOL has not informed
contracted training partners like HBI wheth-
er their successfully operating programs—
and their administering staff—will be relo-
cated or simply terminated along with the
centers they have served.
At a time of endemic labor shortages in
the industry and a record-setting 404,000
open construction positions, eliminating in-
demand workforce training programs could
prove catastrophic for the labor market, the
underserved youth that have benefited from
the opportunity to learn a skilled trade, and
the communities and businesses that turn to
Job Corps for their workforce needs.
NAHB encourages Congress and the De-
partment of Labor to work together to ad-
dress outstanding stakeholder questions
about the proposed closures and urges DOL
to offer a plan that ensures minimal disrup-

Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chair, the Na-

accurately states that ‘‘the Depart-
ment of Labor has not disclosed any
performance metrics or data to support
its closure determinations, and it has
provided little information on how it
will continue to serve the thousands of
at-risk youth who will be displaced
from their local centers.’’
In fact, Mr. Chair, many of the facili-
ties slated to be closed, six out of the
nine, like the Fort Simcoe facility in
my own district, are some of the high-
est-performing centers in the country.
This simply makes no sense.
I thank Mr. SCHRADER and Mr. DEFA-
ZIO, my colleagues from Oregon, as well
as my colleague from Montana (Mr.
GIANFORTE), for their leadership on this
issue, as well as the dozens of bipar-
tisan Members who have been working
alongside Mr. DEFAZIO and myself to
stop this proposal from moving for-
ward.
I urge my colleagues to support our
amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Washington (Mrs. ROD-
GERS), my colleague from just east of
me.
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr.
Chair, I appreciate the leadership of
my colleague from Washington State
(Mr. NEWHOUSE), as well as the leader
from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO), on this bi-
partisan amendment in support of the
Job Corps.
I, too, want to stand in support of the
important work that the Job Corps is
doing, specifically in Ferry County.
In addition to closing other centers,
the administration recently announced
its plans to terminate the agreement
between our Job Corps in Curlew and
the USDA.
In rural Ferry County, which is
largely publicly owned, it is right in
the midst of a million-acre national
forest. The Job Corps is very impor-
tant. It is very important in that it is
one of the largest employers in the
county.
It is also where young people, at-risk
youth, are gaining critical skills nec-
essary to fight fires and to better stew-
ard our Federal forests in eastern
Washington. We are facing larger and
larger catastrophic fires. This Job
Corps program is so important, as well
as the other programs that it is offer-
ing.
This amendment will stop funds from
being used to close the Curlew Job
Corps, as well as others. Whether for
jobs, a healthier environment, or those
on the front lines fighting forest fires
in Washington State and throughout
rural America, I urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘yes’’ and support this amend-
ment.
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chair, I would
like to, again, urge all of my col-
leagues to support this amendment,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. ROY. Mr. Chair, I demand a re-
corded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Oregon will be
postponed.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, just a
few weeks ago, I had a roundtable dis-
cussion with health professionals and
those who are suffering from diabetes.
I heard the stories of how much insulin
costs and how difficult it was to be able
to access healthcare, in many in-
stances. This discussion was held at
the University of Houston medical
school.

more and better treatments for diabe-
tes is aided by an expanded pool of di-
verse and talented medical researchers
and clinical trial participants.
Many racial health disparities, in-
cluding diabetes, stem from a lack of
access to quality healthcare and proper
health awareness. Unfortunately, this
means that the incidence of kidney dis-
ease has not always matched trial pop-
ulations. African Americans represent
12 percent of the U.S. population but
only 5 percent of clinical trial partici-
pants.
b 1730
Hispanics make up 16 percent, but
only 1 percent of clinical trial partici-
pants.
Sex distribution in cardiovascular
device trials is 67 percent male.
Other significant barriers to diversi-
fied clinical trials, which are key to
sound medical research and the founda-
tion for medical cures and break-
throughs, as reported by investigators
and coordinators, are insurance status,
patient inconvenience, cost, avail-
ability of transportation, distance to
the study site, and patient and family
concerns about risk.
My amendment, in particular, fo-
cuses on ensuring the outreach for re-
searchers and, as well, those who would
be participants in clinical trials. Phy-
sicians are the gateway to the patient
as well, and the lack of access to physi-
cians also diminishes the rights or the
ability for people to be in trials.
My amendment is intended to aid in
the necessary effort to diversify the
pool of doctors and medical researchers
conducting clinical trials and, thereby,
helping to diversify the participants in
the clinical trials.
I would ask my colleagues to support
this amendment.
Mr. Chairman, it is important to
take note of this particular chart; pro-
portion of volunteers in clinical re-
search by race and ethnicity. And you
will see, as it relates to minorities, at
every step of the way, dealing with
total U.S. population, only 33 percent
participate. NIH-funded clinical re-
search only 36 percent participate; and
industry-funded clinical trials, a paltry
16.7 percent.
It indicates as well, and I include in
the RECORD ‘‘Clinical Trials Shed Light
on Minority Health.’’
[From FDA Consumer Health Information]
CLINICAL TRIALS SHED LIGHT ON MINORITY
HEALTH
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
is working to increase the participation of
people in racial, ethnic and other minority
groups in the clinical trials that test new
medical products.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
is working to increase the participation of
people in racial, ethnic and other minority
groups in the clinical trials that test new
medical products.
WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?
Ensuring meaningful representation of mi-
norities in clinical trials for regulated med-
ical products is fundamental to FDA’s regu-
latory mission and public health, says Jonca
Bull, M.D., director of the agency’s Office of
Minority Health (OMH). Racial and ethnic
minorities include African American, Amer-
ican Indian, Alaska Native, Asian American,
Hispanic American, Native Hawaiian and Pa-
cific Islander communities.
OMH project manager Christine Merenda,
M.P.H., R.N. explains that clinical trials are
the proving ground for new drugs, vaccines
and devices. They provide the data that will
determine whether FDA approves a manufac-
turer’s application for marketing approval.
‘‘Potential racial, ethnic and other dif-
ferences in response to drugs are important
to FDA’s efforts to help ensure that the safe-
ty and effectiveness of drugs are studied in
all people who will use the products once
they are approved,’’ she says.
CONSIDERING GENETIC DIFFERENCES
Bull explains that there are biological dif-
ferences in how people process drugs. For ex-
ample, variations in genetic coding can
make a cancer treatment more toxic in one
ethnic group than it would be in another.
These variations can make also make drugs
like antidepressants and blood-pressure
medications less effective in one group than
another.
Getting more data on these differences is
essential for FDA to truly know that a med-
ical product will truly work and be safe for
all patients, Bull says.
Members of minority groups may be more
vulnerable to certain diseases. ‘‘We know, for
example, that African-Americans and His-
panics have higher rates of diabetes, HIV/
AIDS, obesity and cardiovascular disease,’’
says Bull. Native Americans and Asians have
been shown to have higher rates of hepatitis,
while Hispanics are disproportionately af-
fected by diabetes.
But historically, both women and minori-
ties have been under-represented in clinical
trails. For example, according to a 2011 re-
port from the conference ‘‘Dialogues on Di-
versifying Clinical Trails,’’ sponsored by
FDA’s Office of Women’s Health and the So-
ciety for Women’s Health Research and sup-
ported by OMH:
∑ African Americans represent 12% of the
U.S. population but only 5% of clinical trial
participants;
∑ Hispanics make up 16% of the population
but only 1% of clinical trial participants;
and
∑ ‘‘Men make up more than two-thirds of
the participants in clinical tests of cardio-
vascular (heart and blood vessel) devices?’’
At the conference, more than 200 rep-
resentatives from government and industry
came together with patient advocates and
the scientific community to discuss strate-
gies for increasing the participation of
women and minorities in clinical trials.
Why the Disparity?
Bull says there are different reasons why
minorities have been under-represented in
clinical trials.
One reason may be a lack of trust because
of past abuses, Bull says. One notorious ex-
ample was the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, ex-
periments conducted between 1932 and 1972
by the U.S. Public Health Service. Health of-
ficials recruited poor black share-croppers in
Alabama to study the natural progress of
syphilis. However, while the study was in
progress, penicillin was discovered to treat
syphilis. The study was not stopped and the
men were not treated with penicillin that
could have cured them.
According to a recent university study,
however, this attitude seems to be changing.
The study was designed to learn the health
concerns and research perceptions among
under-represented groups. When asked about
their over-all interest in medical research, 91
percent of African-Americans expressed in-
terest in participating.
Nonetheless, recruiting people to partici-
pate in clinical trials—no matter what race
or ethnicity—is difficult in general, Bull
notes. FDA works to protect participants in
clinical trials and to ensure that people have
reliable information as they decide whether
to join a clinical trial.
There are many benefits to minority par-
ticipation for researchers that extend, in
larger sense, to society. Minority participa-
tion helps researchers find better treatments
and better ways to fight such diseases as
cancer, diabetes, heart disease and HIV/
AIDS. In addition, it uncovers differences by
gender, race, and ethnicity that may be im-
portant for safe and effective use of thera-
pies.
SAFEGUARDS AND RESOURCES
Safeguards for clinical trial participants
include oversight by institutional review
boards (IRBs), composed of at least five
members, including scientists, doctors, and
lay people. IRBs ensure that appropriate
steps are taken to protect the rights and
welfare of participants as subjects of re-
search.
Though it’s too soon to tell, Bull says that
the FDA Safety and Innovation Act
(FDASIA) signed into law by President
Obama in July 2012 could have a helpful ef-
fect in supporting efforts to enhance minor-
ity participation in clinical trials. FDASIA
requires that FDA report to Congress by
July 9, 2013 on the diversity of participants
in clinical trials and the extent to which
safety and effectiveness data based on such
factors as sex, age, race and ethnicity are in-
cluded in applications submitted to FDA.
Based on these findings, FDA and others
involved in clinical research will be able to
identify needs and opportunties to increase
minority representation, says Bull.
In the meantime, Bull encourages con-
sumers to take a more proactive approach. If
you’re undergoing treatment and your condi-
tion is not improving, she says, you may
want to talk to your health care professional
about the availability of clinical trials that
address our condition.
FDA also has information at fda.gov
(http://www.fda.gov) with information about
participating in clinical trials (http://
www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ByAudience/
ForPatientAdvocates/
ParticipatinginClinicalTrials/default.htm)
and links to an array of resources. And
clinicaltrails.gov (http://
www.clinicaltrials.gov) is another resource
from the National Insitiutes of Health.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman,
the Food and Drug Administration is
working to increase the participation
of people in racial, ethnic, and other
minority groups in the clinical trials
that test new medical products.
So I would indicate that this par-
ticular amendment is to give greater
focus to ensure that we have access to
these individuals. Again, diabetes in
minority communities is surging. The
difficulty of getting access to insulin is
also a conspicuous medical concern.
But certain medical illnesses have been
known to have a higher prevalence in
certain demographic groups, including
Type 2 diabetes, lupus, sickle cell ane-
mia, and triple-negative breast cancer.
This particular amendment is, of
course, helping to end, or to work on
improving the access at this time.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4545
June 12, 2019
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chairman, I rise
in support of this amendment.
African American adults are almost
twice as likely to suffer from diabetes
as White adults and are also more like-
ly to suffer from serious complications,
such as limb amputations.
I agree with the gentlewoman that
increasing the representation of Afri-
can Americans among biomedical re-
searchers, as well as participants in
clinical trials, is essential to address-
ing disparities in health outcomes for
African Americans suffering from this
disease.
I would tell the gentlewoman that I
was part of a bipartisan effort in the
early nineties where we changed the
rules of the NIH, including minorities
and women in clinical trials, but it
would appear that we have more to do.
And we have increased funding for re-
search centers in minority institutions
by $11 million to support the next gen-
eration of researchers and enhance the
research infrastructure in minority-
serving institutions.
I thank the gentlewoman for offering
this amendment. I urge my colleagues
to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I look forward to
working with her to see if we can turn
this around.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I
urge support of this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I wish to thank Chairman MCGOV-
ERN and Ranking Member COLE of the Rules
Committee for making this Jackson Lee
Amendment in order.
I thank Chairwoman DELAURO and Ranking
Member COLE for their hard work in bringing
Division A, the Labor-HHS portion of this om-
nibus appropriations legislative package, to
the floor.
I thank them all for this opportunity to ex-
plain the Jackson Lee Amendment, which
makes a good bill even better by providing
$10 million more to help ensure that the na-
tional goals of finding and bringing more and
better treatments for diabetes is aided by an
expanding pool of diverse and talented med-
ical researchers and clinical trial participants.
Many racial health disparities, including dia-
betes, stem from lack of access to quality
healthcare and proper health awareness.
Unfortunately, this means that incidence of
kidney disease does not always match trial
populations.
For example, consider that:
1. African-Americans represent 12 percent
of the U.S. population but only 5 percent of
clinical trial participants.
2. Hispanics make up 16 percent of the
population but only 1 percent of clinical trial
participants.
3. Sex distribution in cardiovascular device
trials is 67 percent male.
Other significant barriers to diversified clin-
ical trials, which are the key to sound medical
research and the foundation for medical cures
and breakthroughs, as reported by investiga-
tors and coordinators are insurance status, pa-
tient inconvenience costs, availability of trans-
portation, distance to the study site, and pa-
tient and family concerns about risk.
But the most significant barriers limiting clin-
ical participation are race, age, and sex of par-
ticipants:
1. Women and minority patients are more
difficult to recruit.
2. Women and minority physicians have
less experience and are relatively costlier to
engage.
3. Minority patients with limited English pro-
ficiency can require costly translation services.
The first step in engaging women and mi-
norities in clinical trials is finding them.
Research has shown that minority patients
seek physicians of their own race, so bringing
these doctors into trials is critical.
Physicians are the gateway to the patient.
There are disturbing statistics on the num-
ber of African Americans, Hispanics and Na-
tive Americans pursuing academic qualification
and participating in scientific research.
Many barriers exist that account for the low
rate of participation among diverse commu-
nities, including patient fear of experimentation
and lack of understanding or education with
regard to the importance of clinical trials in
creating new treatments and cures.
The Jackson Lee Amendment is intended to
aid in the necessary effort to diversify the pool
of doctors and medical researchers conducting
clinical trials, and thereby helping to diversify
the participants in the clinical trials.
In short, the Jackson Lee Amendment
seeks to open the ‘‘physician gateway’’ to the
patient.
The Journal on STEM Education reported in
2011 that only 8.34 percent of the STEM doc-
torates awarded in 2006 were given to under-
represented minorities (URMs), despite mak-
ing up approximately 28 percent of the U.S.
population.
Additionally, GAO found that while the per-
centage of underrepresented minorities nation-
wide increased from 13 percent to 19 percent
from 1994 to 2003, the total number of STEM
doctorates awarded to the same group
dropped during this period from 8,335 to
7,310.
In response, the National Institute of Gen-
eral Medical Sciences (NIGMS) created the
Minority Opportunities in Research (MORE)
Division and similar academic intervention pro-
grams.
The MORE programs are comprised of four
primary components: research experience,
mentoring and advisement, supplemental in-
struction and workshops, and financial sup-
port.
This includes the Minority Biomedical Re-
search Support-Research Initiative for Sci-
entific Enhancement (MBRS-RISE) program,
the Minority Access to Research Careers
(MARC), Post-baccalaureate Research Edu-
cation Program (PREP), and the Bridges to
the Baccalaureate and Bridges to the Ph.D.
programs.
The amount of funds dedicated to these
programs reflects the commitment by the
science and research community to the goals
of the MORE Division in addressing this prob-
lem.
Certain medical illnesses have been known
to have higher prevalence in certain demo-
graphic groups, including type II diabetes,
lupus, sickle cell anemia, and Triple Negative
Breast Cancer for which African Americans
are more than twice as likely to be diagnosed
on average.
Race and ethnicity have also been shown to
affect the effectiveness of and response to
certain drugs, such as antihypertensive thera-
pies in the treatment of hypertension in African
Americans and anti-depressants in Hispanics.
Increased diversity in research trials could
help researchers find better, more precise
ways to fight diseases that disproportionately
impact certain populations and may be impor-
tant for the safe and effective use of new
therapies.
But before we can engage more women
and minorities to participate in clinical trials,
we must be able to find them.
And the key to finding minority patients is
find more physicians from their racial and eth-
nic groups because research has shown that
physicians are the gateway to the patient.
The Jackson Lee Amendment opens that
gateway.
I urge support for the Jackson Lee Amend-
ment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman,
let me take this opportunity to thank
Congresswoman DELAURO and her lead-
ership as the chairwoman of this sub-
committee, and her ranking member,
Mr. COLE. I had the privilege of appear-
ing before them in making my request,
and so I want to thank them for many
of the requests. I don’t want to be too
celebratory and say all of my requests,
but I am very pleased that the invest-
ment in healthcare, education, many of
the issues that I was concerned about,
are well-invested, and it will be the
kind of announcements that I will be
able to make in my district for the
great needs that are needed.
My amendment is to emphasize the
importance of a program that, when I
went to graduations, I saw students
wearing banners, if you will, that said
the word ‘‘TRIO;’’ that they were grad-
uating with the help of TRIO. They
were going on to college with the help
of TRIO. And I was very excited about

the opportunity of seeing, in living
proof, the proud symbols of those who
had had a greater opportunity.
My amendment makes, again, a good
bill even better by providing $10 mil-
lion more to help ensure that TRIO
students at the greatest risk of not
completing their degree program get
additional assistance to finish their
education. I was excited when these
students walked across the stage going
on to college with TRIO support.
TRIO is a set of seven federally-fund-
ed education opportunity outreach pro-
grams that help low-income, first-gen-
eration students, and students with
disabilities, to pursue higher edu-
cation.
There are many opportunities for in-
dividuals to go into the trades and
other disciplines, but many want to go
to college.
The Upward Bound Program, the
first Federal TRIO Program, was cre-
ated in 1964. Later, Talent Search was
created. The TRIO name itself was
born four years later, when the Higher
Education Act of 1965 was amended to
include Special Services for Disadvan-
taged Students.
So today, there are nine TRIO pro-
grams that I am excited about; and my
emphasis is to ensure that these pro-
grams are well-funded.
Even in my own community, I can
tell you that TRIO is well-needed and
well-utilized.
Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to
support the Jackson Lee amendment.
Mr. Chairman, could you tell me how
much time is remaining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Texas has 23⁄4 minutes remaining.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chairman, I rise
in support of this amendment.
The TRIO programs provide student
support services to students in helping
them to pursue and to complete a col-
lege education. These students may be
the first in their families to attend col-
lege or face other challenges. The stu-
dent support services provided under
the TRIO programs include tutoring,
academic advice, financial aid coun-
seling, college preparation, and so
much more.
To help our most vulnerable youth
access and succeed in college, the
Labor-HHS bill increases funding for
TRIO by $100 million, for a total of
$1.16 billion. And I can tell you, there
is bipartisan support for this effort be-
cause I know that Ranking Member
COLE is a strong supporter of the TRIO
program. He recognizes its ability to
help youngsters be able to realize their
dreams and their aspirations.
So I appreciate that the amendment
is highlighting the importance of pro-
viding services to encourage individ-
uals from disadvantaged backgrounds
to enter, to complete college, and post-
graduate education, and I am happy to
support it.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I
am excited that, in 1986, we added the
Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate
Achievement Program—we all remem-
ber him as a great astronaut who died
in a horrific astronaut calamity—to
foster doctoral degree attainment by
students from underrepresented seg-
ments of society.
But, Mr. Chair, a young man went to
the Upward Bound program at the his-
torically Black Texas Southern Univer-
sity. He graduated from Sterling High
School, but he grew up in extreme pov-
erty, stricken with food insecurities
and difficult living conditions.
Poverty is not only a state of being,
but a state of mind.
However, with the help of TRIO, he
went on to acquire life skills, strate-
gies, and the support he needed to fol-
low the dream of attending the Univer-
sity of Texas at San Antonio, majoring
in Construction Science Management.
Not only did he graduate from UTSA,
but he graduated with honors, and he
plans to attend graduate school in the
fall. He is one of many students that
are impacted; and the more we focus on
the at-risk students, the more America
continues to ascend to her greatest
level.
We helped Terrance, who is a 40-year-
old student that began working on his
GED at Houston Community College in
2005. He ultimately achieved it 5 years
later.
My amendment, again, is to empha-
size the doors of opportunity, from
Ronald E. McNair, Student Support
Services, Talent Search, the Training
Program for Federal TRIO Programs,
Upward Bound, Upward Bound Math
and Science, and Veterans Upward
Bound. It is encompassing of many as-
pects of young people and those return-
ing to school.
I ask my colleagues to support the
Jackson Lee amendment, which fo-
cuses on those at risk, and turns that
at risk into success.
Mr. Chair, I wish to thank Chairman MCGOV-
ERN and Ranking Member COLE of the Rules
Committee for making this Jackson Lee
Amendment in order.
I thank Chairwoman DELAURO and Ranking
Member COLE for their hard work in bringing
Division A, the Labor-HHS portion of this om-
nibus appropriations legislative package, to

I thank them all for this opportunity to ex-
plain the Jackson Lee Amendment, which

dents at the greatest risk of not completing
their degree program get additional assistance
to finish their education.
TRIO is a set of seven federally-funded edu-
cational opportunity outreach programs that
help low-income, first-generation students and
students with disabilities to pursue higher edu-
cation.
The Upward Bound Program, the first Fed-
eral TRIO Program, was created under the au-
thority of the Economic Opportunity Act of
1964, as amended.
A year later, Talent Search was created as
part of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to
assist students applying for newly authorized
federal financial aid for postsecondary edu-
cation.
The TRIO name itself was born four years
later when the Higher Education Act of 1965
was amended in 1968 to include the Special
Services for Disadvantaged Students pro-
gram—what is now called Student Support
Services (SSS).
Since 1968, TRIO programs have been ex-
panded to provide a wider range of services.
Today, nine TRIO programs are included
under the TRIO umbrella, seven of which pro-
vide direct services to students.
The 1972 amendments to the Higher Edu-
cation Act created Educational Opportunity
Centers (EOCs) to help adults select a post-
secondary education program and obtain fi-
nancial aid.
Veterans Upward Bound (VUB) was also ini-
tiated in the 1972 as part of the Upward
Bound program to serve returning Vietnam
veterans.
Amendments in 1986 added the Ronald E.
McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Pro-
gram (McNair) to foster doctoral degree attain-
ment by students from underrepresented seg-
ments of society.
In 1990 the Upward Bound Math and
Science (UBMS) program was initiated as part
of the Upward Bound program to address the
need for specific instruction in the fields of
mathematics and science.
TRIO also includes a training program for
project directors and other staff of TRIO
projects (Training Program for Federal TRIO
Programs, which was authorized in 1976).
The TRIO programs are administered by the
Student Service area of the Department’s Of-
fice of Postsecondary Education.
TRIO includes: Educational Opportunity
Centers; Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate
Achievement; Student Support Services; Tal-
ent Search; Training Program for Federal
TRIO Programs Staff; Upward Bound; Upward
Bound Math-Science; and Veterans Upward
Bound.
Currently serving nearly 790,000 students
across America, TRIO provides academic tu-
toring, personal counseling, mentoring, finan-
cial guidance, and other supports necessary
for educational access and retention.
TRIO programs serve students from middle
school and high school (Talent Search, Up-
ward Bound, Upward Bound Math-Science) to
college and postgraduate study (Student Sup-
port Services, Ronald E. McNair

TERRANCE, AGE 40
Terrance is a 40-year-old student that
began working on his GED at Houston Com-
munity College in 2005.
Upon meeting Terrance in his GED class,
he explained that he had been working on his
GED off and on and was unsuccessful at com-
pleting his GED because of the cost of the
exam and his inability to pass certain portions
of the exam.
He is a father and has also worked odd jobs
while attempting to complete his GED.
TRIO offered Terrance an alternative to the
GED exam, the HiSet, which is an approved
high school equivalency certification recog-
nized by the Texas Education Agency.
In addition to offering him an alternative
exam, HCC provided him with vouchers to
cover the cost of the exam and within his first
attempt of taking the HiSet exam, he success-
fully earned his high school equivalent certifi-
cate.
We assisted Terrance with applying for col-
lege and financial aid and he is currently en-
rolled at and set to begin college classes this
fall to earn a Communications degree.

TRIO Educational Opportunity Center.
ERIC, AGE 44
Eric is a 44-year-old student that began
working on his GED in 1995, stopped attend-
ing and then returned to complete his GED in
2017 when he was unable to receive a pro-
motion on his job because he did not have a
high school diploma.
After several attempts at the GED, Eric was
unable to pass portions of the GED exam be-
cause of his work schedule that prevented him
from attending class regularly.
Eric struggled with portions of the exam and
TRIO offered him tutorial services and the al-
ternative HiSet exam.
Eric successfully passed the HiSet exam
and earned his High School Equivalent certifi-
cate.
TRIO also assisted Eric with applying for fi-
nancial aid and college admissions.
Eric will begin working on his pre-nursing
courses in the fall so that he can eventually
apply to nursing school and receive a pro-
motion at his job.
CHRISTINA, AGE 65
Christina is a 65-year-old disabled student
that contacted TRIO because she had prob-
lems finding a program that would lead to a
job.
She wants to get off disability and work in
an office job so that she can take care of her-
self without the limited income that disability
provides.
TRIO was able to advocate for Christina to
get financial aid reinstated because she was
on probation when she attended previously,
due to the demands on her time because of
having to care of her sick husband, who died
when she was in school.
The TRIO Educational Opportunity Center
was also able to connect her with free tuition
that is offered by Houston Community College
so that she can maximize her financial aid.
We assisted Christina with finding a pro-
gram that will give her the technology/com-
puter skills she needs that will lead to a job.
Christina is currently enrolled in summer
classes and pursuing a degree in Business
Technology.

AMENDMENT NO. 16 OFFERED BY MR. PASCRELL
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 16 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentleman

Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New Jersey.
Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I
want to thank Congresswoman
DELAURO and Ranking Member COLE
for their support for my amendment
and support for the fire services.
I rise as the proud co-chair of the
Congressional Fire Service Caucus to
be on the front lines fighting for the
brave men and women who put their
lives on the line every day.
We know that firefighters are rou-
tinely exposed to a variety of carcino-
gens in chaotic and uncontrolled envi-
ronments, but we do not have a good
sense of the full impacts of their expo-
sure. This is why we passed the Fire-
fighter Cancer Registry Act into law
last year. That bill was championed by
Representative CHRIS COLLINS of New
York, and he has cosponsored this
amendment today.
Mr. Chairman, along my journey to
create a National Firefighter Cancer
Registry I heard the struggle of a can-
cer survivor who has dedicated—all of
them dedicated their lives to the fire
service. While some beat the odds we,
unfortunately, lost Fire Chief Gene
Dannenfelser, of the Haddon Heights
Volunteer Fire Department in 2017.
Gene fought a courageous battle with
9/11-related lung cancer. To honor him,
and all those brothers and sisters
struggling, we fought to get this bill
into law.
This bill directed the Centers for Dis-
ease Control to develop a specialized
cancer registry for firefighters to pro-
vide scientists and medical profes-
sionals data to better understand can-
cer trends among our firefighters. But
for the registry to be effective, it needs
the resources to maximize firefighter
participation.
I appreciate that the committee in-
cluded a line item for the registry. This
amendment merely ensures the Fire-
fighter Cancer Registry is fully funded.
The registry will help us improve our
knowledge of cancer incidence in fire-
fighters.
Mr. Chairman, I include in the
RECORD a letter from 11 fire services
organizations, including the Inter-
national Association of Fire Fighters,
in support of this amendment.

DEAR CONGRESSMAN PASCRELL & CONGRESS-
MAN COLLINS: On behalf of the nation’s fire
and emergency services, we write in support
of your amendment to H.R. 2740, the Fiscal
Year 2020 Labor, Health and Human Services,
Education, Legislative Branch, Defense,
State, Foreign Operations, and Energy and
Water Development Appropriations Act. Spe-
cifically, your amendment will fully fund the
Firefighter Cancer Registry at the author-
ized level of $2.5 million.
During the 115th Congress, both the House
and Senate unanimously approved the Fire-
fighter Cancer Registry Act (P.L. 115–194).
The bipartisan legislation instructed the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) to create a specialized national reg-
istry to provide researchers and epidemiolo-
gists with the tools and resources needed to
improve research collection activities re-
lated to the monitoring of cancer incidence
among firefighters.
Studies have indicated a strong link be-
tween firefighting and an increased risk of
several major cancers. However, certain
studies examining cancer risks among fire-
fighters have been limited by the avail-
ability of important data and relatively
small sample sizes that have an underrep-
resentation of women, minorities, and volun-
teer firefighters. As a result, public health
researchers are unable to fully examine and
understand the broader epidemiological can-
cer trends among firefighters. The Fire-
fighter Cancer Registry is an important re-
source to better understand the link between
firefighting and cancer, potentially leading
to better prevention and safety protocols. It
is critical that Congress fully fund the pro-
gram in Fiscal Year 2020 to ensure the CDC
has adequate resources to engage in a robust
public outreach effort to promote the Reg-
istry and encourage participation by a large
and diverse group of firefighters.
Thank you for offering this important
amendment and your continued leadership

Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr.
Chairman, I rise in opposition, but I do
support the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from New York is
recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr.
Chairman, I support this amendment
introduced by Congressman PASCRELL,
and I am a proud cosponsor in this bi-
partisan effort to address the increased
rate of cancer incidents with fire-
fighters.
While common sense tells us these
emergency responders frequently in-
hale smoke and other harmful sub-
stances, it is essential that a link is
identified between specific chemicals
and diseases and cancers in order to
provide more safeguards for our first
responders.
b 1745
This registry will allow the Centers
for Disease Control to compile a large
database of cancer incidents amongst
firefighters, and through expanded re-
search, we hope to develop new tech-
nologies, protocols, and safeguards for
these brave men and women.
Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chair-
woman LOWEY and Ranking Member
GRANGER for providing increased fund-
ing to the Firefighter Cancer Registry
compared to last year; however, it is
vital that we secure the full authorized
amount of $2.5 million to ensure the
registry can be fully implemented by
the CDC.
Mr. Chair, I am proud to have worked
with Congressman PASCRELL in passing
the Firefighter Cancer Registry Act
last Congress, and look forward to con-
tinue working together to support the
firefighters who risk their lives every
day.
Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chair, I yield as
much time as she may consume to the
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I rise in
support of this amendment.
The National Institute for Occupa-
tional Safety and Health, NIOSH, is
leading the effort to track the link be-
tween the workplace exposures of fire-
fighters and cancer. This registry will
provide something that is a more com-
plete, broader representation of our
firefighters in our country compared to
previous studies.
The underlying bill that we are con-
sidering includes an increase of $600,000
to the National Firefighter Registry,
and this amendment would provide an
additional increase of $900,000.
Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for
offering this amendment to highlight
the importance of the health of our
firefighters, first responders who never
say no. They were going up in the
building on 9/11 while others were com-
ing down in order to be able to survive,
and so many lost their lives on that
day.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘yes.’’
Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chair, I thank
Madam Chair for her comments.
Mr. Chair, I strongly encourage my
colleagues to join me in supporting the
amendment, and I yield back the bal-

AMENDMENT NO. 17 OFFERED BY MR. DANNY K.
DAVIS OF ILLINOIS
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 17 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chair, I have an amendment at the
desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 52, line 5, after the dollar amount, in-
sert ‘‘(increased by $2,000,000)’’.
Page 90, line 6, after the first dollar
amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $2,000,000)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to

from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS) and
a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman

Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chair, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
First of all, I want to thank Rep-
resentative BURGESS and Representa-
tive G.K. BUTTERFIELD, both of whom
have been very helpful in putting this
amendment together.
The Davis-Burgess-Butterfield bipar-
tisan amendment would increase the
funding to the account of the National
Center on Birth Defects, Development
Disabilities, and Disabilities by $2 mil-
lion and decrease the administration
account in the Office of the Secretary
of Health and Human Services by $2
million.
Currently, under this account, there
is no money allocated for the Public
Health Approach to Blood Disorders
Program for Sickle Cell Disease. In-
creasing funding would support the
CDC’s sickle cell disease surveillance
program to better identify affected in-
dividuals, to understand their health
outcomes, and to evaluate strategies to
prevent complications and risk factors
that affect individuals living with this
devastating disease.
The $2 million funding for the Davis-
Burgess-Butterfield amendment would
assist in establishing a grant program
for States representing a majority of
the sickle cell disease patient popu-
lation. The current surveillance con-
ducted by the CDC is limited to the
States of California and Georgia.
The data accumulated under this
grant program, authorized by Public
Law 115–327, would cover associated
health outcomes, would identify health
disparities, and would evaluate the im-
pact of genetic, environmental, behav-
ioral, and other risk factors that may
impact health.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Chair, I claim the
time in opposition to the amendment,
even though I am not opposed to it.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Texas is rec-
ognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, I am glad to be cospon-
soring this amendment and partnering
with Representative DANNY K. DAVIS
once again to continue this important
work that we did in sending the Sickle
Cell Disease and Other Heritable Blood
Disorders Research Surveillance, Pre-
vention, and Treatment Act of 2018 to
the President’s desk last December.
In all the hubbub of the election
cycle in the fall of 2018, it is easy to
lose sight of some of the accomplish-
ments, but this was a significant ac-
complishment of the last Congress.
Mr. Chair, I made a commitment to
Mr. DAVIS at the beginning of the last
Congress that, as chairman of the Sub-
committee on Health of the Energy and
Commerce Committee, I would make
the passage of his sickle cell reauthor-
ization bill a priority.
This was important. It had been
years since this bill had been reauthor-
ized. It first passed in 1972. The last re-
authorization was part of a tax bill
that was signed into law by George
Bush in 2004.
In the fall of 2018, after nearly 20
months of work, the House passed their
product in February of 2017, and the
Senate did. It is to be commended that
the other body did act, and Senator
TIM SCOTT of South Carolina and Sen-
ator COREY BOOKER of New Jersey got a
bill through the Senate and brought it
back to the House, where it was passed
and then sent down to the President of
the United States for his signature.
President Trump did indeed sign the
first stand-alone sickle cell reauthor-
ization in decades, and this was signed
last December.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4549
June 12, 2019
Mr. Chair, when we had a hearing on
sickle cell in the summer of 2016, one of
the witnesses, a witness from the Sick-
le Cell Disease Advocates Alliance,
came and spoke to our subcommittee
and said it had been decades since the
Food and Drug Administration had ap-
proved a new therapy for sickle cell,
hydroxyurea, decades ago.
Then in 2017, the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration approved Endari, which
was the first new therapy in years.
Earlier this year, Dr. Francis Collins
went on ‘‘60 Minutes’’ and said that we
can now use the word ‘‘cure’’ because
of a new gene editing treatment that
relieves these patients of their crip-
pling symptoms and enables them to
lead regular lives. This is a spelling
error of two bases, a transcription
error of two bases in the part of the
gene that encodes for the hemoglobin
molecule. The National Institutes of
Health is now talking about providing
a therapy for that, that, in fact, we can
talk about the word ‘‘cure.’’ So this
amendment is a downpayment on that
cure.
Mr. Chair, I certainly thank Mr.
DAVIS for his years of dedication to
moving these projects forward.
This amendment provides $2 million
for the Public Health Approach to
Blood Disorders Program for Sickle
Cell Disease and support for the CDC
sickle cell disease surveillance pro-
gram.
Years and years and years ago, I
worked at Parkland Hospital. I took
care of patients with sickle cell, kids
that would come to the emergency
room in crisis, a very, very painful con-
dition. We didn’t have much to offer
back then: hydration with an IV,
Thorazine so that they wouldn’t climb
the walls, and morphine to try to help
their pain, but it really wasn’t nearly
enough.
Every one of those painful crises was
accompanied by destruction, destruc-
tion that went on within their bodies
because of these sickle cells that were
cramped up inside blood vessels and
killed kidney cells, killed liver cells,
killed bone marrow cells. These kids
hurt worse than anything I have ever
seen, and now we are talking about
providing them the opportunity to lead
a regular life.
This is powerful stuff. That shows
what this Congress can do when they
put together their partisan differences.
Mr. Chair, I really do want to thank
Mr. DAVIS of Illinois for his efforts. I
mean, he has pushed this issue by him-
self for years and years.
Mr. Chair, I am proud to have been a
small part of that when we got the bill
across the floor of the House and into
the office of the President of the
United States. I am proud of President
Trump for signing the first stand-alone
sickle cell reauthorization in decades.
Now I am proud to stand on the floor
with Representative DAVIS and see if
we can’t get just a little additional
funding to get this one pushed a little
further down the line because of the
unbelievable, unparalleled good we are
going to do with this.
Think of what the cost to this coun-
try was for doing nothing for 40 years
on this illness. When people say this
treatment is going to be expensive, yes,
it will be expensive, but what is the
cost of doing nothing?
Mr. Chair, this is an important
amendment. I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote on
Mr. DAVIS’ amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chairman, I include in the RECORD this
letter of support from the American
Society of Hematology and the Sickle
Cell Disease Association of America.
AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HEMATOLOGY
AND THE SICKLE CELL DISEASE AS-
SOCIATION OF AMERICA, INC,
June 12, 2019.
Hon. DANNY DAVIS,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
Hon. MICHAEL BURGESS,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
Hon. G.K. BUTTERFIELD,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVES DAVIS, BURGESS,
AND BUTTERFIELD: The American Society of
Hematology (ASH) and the Sickle Cell Dis-
ease Association of America (SCDAA)
strongly support your amendment to provide
$2 million in funding for the sickle cell dis-
ease (SCD) data collection program author-
ized by the Sickle Cell Disease Research,
Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment
Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–327). Your amend-
ment will enable the CDC to expand its ef-
forts to improve SCD surveillance in the
United States.
The Davis/Burgess/Butterfield amendment
will add $2 M in funding to the National Cen-
ter for Birth Defects and Developmental Dis-
abilities, Public Health Approach to Blood
Disorders account. This program currently
oversees SCD public health surveillance in
the states of California and Georgia and has
recently released a grant announcement for
additional states to take the necessary steps
to engage in SCD data collection. The
amendment will enable additional high inci-
dence states to undertake SCD surveillance.
The CDC estimates that SCD affects nearly
100,000 Americans; however, absent a nation-
wide surveillance program, we are not con-
fident of this estimate, nor do we know
where individuals with SCD live, how they
receive care or if they have access to
healthcare providers with expertise in SCD.
Surveillance is necessary to improve under-
standing of the health outcomes and health
care system utilization patterns of people
with SCD, increase evidence for public
health programs, and establish cost effective
practices to improve and extend the lives of
people with SCD.
SCD is an inherited, lifelong disorder that
causes a person’s red blood cells to become
deformed and get stuck in veins, blocking
oxygen flow throughout the body. This dev-
astating disease can cause complications in-
cluding severe pain, stroke, acute chest syn-
drome, organ damage, and in some cases pre-
mature death. The many complications of
SCD can make every stage of life extremely
challenging for individuals with the disease.
This is compounded by the fact that many
people living with SCD are unable to access
quality care and are limited by a lack of ef-
fective treatment options.
ASH represents more than 17,000 physi-
cians, researchers, and medical trainees
committed to the study and treatment of
blood and blood-related diseases and dis-
orders, including SCD. SCDAA’s mission is
to advocate for people affected by sickle cell
conditions and empower community-based
organizations to maximize quality of life and
raise public consciousness while advancing
the search for a universal cure.
Thank you again for your leadership to im-
prove ‘‘the lives of individuals living with
SCD. Expansion of CDC’s work in SCD will
significantly help improve our under-
standing of the disorder and in turn, improve
healthcare outcomes for individuals with
SCD.
Sincerely,
ROY L. SILVERSTEIN, MD,
ASH President.
BEVERLY FRANCIS-GIBSON,
M.A,
SCDAA President and
Chief Executive Offi-
cer.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chair, I yield such time as she may
consume to the gentlewoman from
Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I thank
my colleague for yielding, and I rise in
support of this amendment.
Sickle cell disease is a major public
health concern. It affects an estimated
100,000 Americans, with a dispropor-
tionate effect on African Americans.
People living with sickle cell disease
experience significant pain and life-
threatening complications.
The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention is working to better iden-
tify affected individuals, to understand
their health outcomes, and to evaluate
strategies to prevent complications
and factors that affect individuals liv-
ing with sickle cell disease.
We may be close to a cure for sickle
cell disease because of gene editing,
making it all the more important for
us to work with people who live day
after day with sickle cell.
Mr. Chair, I commend the gentleman
for raising attention about this impor-
tant program, and I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chairman, I simply want to commend
and thank, again, Dr. BURGESS for not
only his passion, but the tremendous
work and effort that he has put forth
over the years to help make sure that
this population group gets the service
and attention that they deserve.
Mr. Chair, I thank Representative
DELAURO for her comments, especially
the fact that many researchers believe
that they are very close to finding a
cure for sickle cell anemia, and this
just moves us one step further.
Mr. Chair, I urge adoption, and I
yield back the balance of my time.

The Acting CHAIR (during the vote).
There is 1 minute remaining.
b 1916
So the amendment was agreed to.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I move
to strike the last word.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from New York is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I yield
to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.
PALLONE), my good friend and the
chairman of the Energy and Commerce
Committee.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I rise
for the purpose of engaging in a col-
loquy with the chairwoman of the Ap-
propriations Subcommittee on State,
Foreign Operations, and Related Pro-
grams on the policy restricting travel
and communications of United States
Government personnel to Nagorno-
Karabakh. Madam Chair, I want to
thank Chairwoman LOWEY for the op-
portunity to discuss this important
issue.
I had proposed an amendment to
Rules that would prevent funds from
being used to implement an official ban
on U.S. diplomatic efforts with the ter-
ritory of Nagorno-Karabakh, or the Re-
public of Artsakh, as it is commonly
referred to by its citizens.
At present, only a handful of highly
specialized U.S. officials connected to
the Organization for Security and Co-
operation in Europe, or OSCE, Minsk
Group, are allowed to travel to
Nagorno-Karabakh or to engage di-
rectly with officials who represent that
territory.
Madam Chair, it is far past time that
the United States take a more engaged
role in the region to finally end this
decades-long conflict. We must remain
committed to strengthening the
ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh, remov-
ing barriers to dialogue, and resolving

status and security issues that have
hindered discussions in the past.
Allowing direct, open dialogue and
our diplomats to have a presence on
the ground, as necessary and when
safe, is the only way for the United
States to help bring this conflict to a
resolution. And, ultimately, it would
go a long way towards producing a
long-lasting, more democratic future
for the people of Nagorno-Karabakh.
Madam Chair, I thank Chairwoman
LOWEY, who has been very supportive
of Armenia and protecting Nagorno-
Karabakh for as long as I have known
her. We came to Congress the same
year. We traveled to Nagorno-
Karabakh. She really is a champion of
the region. So I thank her for the op-
portunity to discuss the intent of my
amendment and look forward to work-
ing with her and her staff to that end.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I thank
my good friend, Mr. PALLONE, for
bringing this issue to our attention and
for his longstanding efforts to bring
this conflict to an end.
Madam Chair, we can all agree on the
need to bring the 30-year Nagorno-
Karabakh conflict to a peaceful resolu-
tion, as we can all agree upon the need
to maintain the United States’ role as
a neutral, third-party arbiter and for
the United States to maintain positive
diplomatic relations with both Arme-
nia and Azerbaijan.
I thank the gentleman for bringing
this matter to our attention, and I and
my staff look forward to working with
Mr. PALLONE and his staff on this im-
portant issue.
Madam Chairwoman, I yield back the
balance of my time.
AMENDMENT NO. 18 OFFERED BY MR. BUCHANAN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 18 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Chair, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 59, line 9, after the dollar amount, in-
sert ‘‘(reduced by $6,250,000) (increased by
$6,250,000)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentleman
from Florida (Mr. BUCHANAN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Florida.
Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of my amendment.
My amendment instructs the Na-
tional Institutes of Health to designate
$6.25 million to research the long-term
effects of red tide and other harmful
algal blooms on human health.
As you may know, last year, Florida
suffered from one of the longest and
most devastating bouts of red tide in
our State’s history. I witnessed first-
hand as thousands of tons of dead ma-
rine life washed ashore our local beach-
es, causing significant hardship on
both our local residents and county
governments.
While some of the short-term health
impacts of red tide are well docu-
mented, as swimmers and beach goers
often suffer from severe respiratory
issues, skin irritation, and rashes, the
long-term health effects of exposure to
red tide are largely unknown. That is
why my amendment will devote crit-
ical resources to help us better under-
stand the lasting health impacts on
people exposed to red tide.
I urge the amendment’s adoption,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I claim
the time in opposition, although I do
not oppose the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of the amendment.
I share the gentleman’s concerns
about the potential health impacts of
red tide and harmful algal blooms and
recognize the opportunity for NIH re-
search to contribute to the body of
knowledge on this topic.
I would note that the underlying bill
under consideration today provides an
additional $1 million for the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention to
expand its efforts related to surveil-
lance and reporting of health concerns
related to harmful algal blooms.
Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman
for his amendment and urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Chair, I
urge adoption of my amendment, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. BUCHANAN).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. ROY. Madam Chair, I demand a
recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Florida will be
postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 19 OFFERED BY MR. LANGEVIN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 19 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Chair, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 87, line 12, after the first dollar
amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $4,500,000)’’.
Page 90, line 6, after the first dollar
amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $5,000,000)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentleman
from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN) and
a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Rhode Island.
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Chair, my amendment sup-
ports the 43 million family caregivers
nationwide who provide long-term
services to their aging or disabled
loved ones.
These individuals provide the vast
majority of long-term care in our coun-
try. In fact, AARP, if you had to put a
dollar figure on it, has estimated that
family caregivers provide some $470 bil-
lion a year in uncompensated care.
Respite care services provide short-
term relief for these family caregivers
and is one of the most frequently re-
quested services.
Let’s face it, if a caregiver can’t take
care of their own health or get a break
and look out for their well-being, they
certainly will have a very hard time
providing the very best care for their
loved ones in need.
Access to respite care has been shown
to improve caregiver health and well-
being, promote family stability, and
avoid or delay the need for admission
to costly institutional settings, result-
ing in significant savings for both the
healthcare system and taxpayers.
The Lifespan Respite Care Program
is the only Federal effort that provides
respite care services regardless of age
or disability. The Lifespan Respite
Care Program is often the only open
door for families affected by conditions
with an earlier onset, like multiple
sclerosis, since other Federal programs
are focused on children or seniors.
Madam Chair, 37 States and the Dis-
trict of Columbia have used Lifespan
Respite Care grants to coordinate and
streamline respite services as well as
provide direct resources to help fami-
lies pay for planned or emergency res-
pite care.
Providing an additional $4.5 million
for the Lifespan Respite Care Program
will allow the Administration for Com-
munity Living to award additional
grants to States and allow existing
grantees to reach more families.
By investing in the Lifespan Respite
Care Program, we support family mem-
bers who perform the rewarding but de-
manding task of caregiving and em-
power individuals to live at home,
where they are most comfortable,
while reducing costs to the healthcare
system.
Madam Chair, in closing, let me
thank my good friend Ms. DELAURO,
the chair of the subcommittee, for her
years of leadership fighting to improve
the healthcare system for the under-
privileged.
By adopting this amendment, we will
be setting the appropriation at the
highest level since the program was au-
thorized in 2006 by legislation authored
by myself as well as Congressman Mike
Ferguson. It was a bipartisan bill.
I deeply appreciate the chairwoman’s
attention to this issue, among many
others, and I would again like to thank
her and the ranking member for their
work on this bill.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to show their support for family care-
givers by voting in favor of this amend-
ment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4560 June 12, 2019
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO).
b 1930
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentleman for yielding, and
I strongly support my friend’s amend-
ment to increase the Administration
for Community Living’s lifespan res-
pite care program.
There are over 43 million family
caregivers in this country providing
the vast majority of our Nation’s long-
term services and support. National,
State, and local surveys have shown
respite care to be among the most fre-
quently requested services by family
caregivers.
In kitchen-cabinet meetings I hosted
in my home State of Connecticut, I had
constituents asking me about how res-
pite care relief could be available to
them.
The committee included additional
resources for respite care in several
places in the bill. We provided a $21
million increase for the national fam-
ily caregivers program. We included a
$4 million demonstration project
through the Alzheimer’s disease pro-
gram to provide direct respite services
to these caregivers and to demonstrate
the benefits these services can provide.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Chair, I
yield an additional 30 seconds to the
gentlewoman from Connecticut.
Ms. DELAURO. We included a modest
increase for the lifespan respite care
program, but this program really is
unique in that it is the only Federal ef-
fort that addresses respite care issues
for families regardless of age or dis-
ability. An additional $4.5 million will
go a long way for this small but
mighty program.
I appreciate my friend taking the
time to highlight it, and I thank him
for all of his service.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support the amendment.
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Chair, I
yield myself the balance of the time.
Madam Chair, I want to, again, stress
the importance of providing respite
services to our Nation’s 43 million fam-
ily caregivers. Respite care has been
proven to save both the healthcare sys-
tem and taxpayers money, and the life-
span respite care program is the only
Federal effort that provides these serv-
ices regardless of age or disabilities.
We can make a difference for these
family caregivers by giving them addi-
tional support and respite. It is the
right thing to do. It will help them to
preserve their own health and preserve
the family unit so that they can stay
strong to provide further care for their
loved ones.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LAN-
GEVIN).

Mr. ROY. Madam Chair, I demand a
recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to

AMENDMENT NO. 20 OFFERED BY MR. FOSTER
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 20 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 164, beginning at line 13, strike sec-
tion 510.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentleman
from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Illinois.
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Chair, this bi-
partisan amendment, offered by myself
and the gentleman from Pennsylvania
(Mr. KELLY), would strike section 510,
which bans HHS from adopting stand-
ards for a unique patient identifier
that would allow patients to be unique-
ly identified across electronic health
record systems.
In the last 21 years that this mis-
guided policy has been in place, thou-
sands of Americans have died due to
giving the wrong drug to the wrong pa-
tient or due to incorrect or incomplete
electronic medical records, all arising
from the inability to simply and cor-
rectly merge health records from dif-
ferent systems.
Countless man-hours have been lost
trying to figure out whether one pa-
tient’s information is the same as an-
other whose name might be spelled dif-
ferently, or who has recently moved to
a new city or State, or who might be
under a maiden name, for example.
Matching records properly requires a
unique identifier for each patient. A
Federal ban on doing this properly
makes our healthcare system more ex-
pensive and less safe for patients.
According to a 2016 study of
healthcare executives, 86 percent of re-
spondents have witnessed or knew of a
medical error that was the result of pa-
tient misidentification.
A Johns Hopkins study recently cal-
culated that more than 250,000 deaths
per year are due to preventable med-
ical errors. While our data collection
on medical errors is not as detailed as
it should be, it is reasonable to assume
that a unique patient identifier would
help save a nontrivial fraction of these
lives.
Amidst the wave of digitization of
the healthcare industry, most pro-
viders have adopted electronic health
records, spurred on by the 2009 HITECH
Act. But if we cannot ensure that we
have the right patient with their full
information at the point of care, then
we cannot properly utilize the enor-
mous promise of the portability and
interoperability of health records.
This ban is also handcuffing us in the
fight against opioids. A 2018 roundtable
on the opioid crisis cohosted by HHS
and the nonprofit Center for Open Data
Enterprise recommended the genera-
tion of a unique identifier for each pa-
tient. This would not only guard
against doctor shopping by those strug-
gling with substance abuse disorder,
but it could also prevent those in re-
covery from accidentally being given
prescription opioids after an injury,
surgery, or childbirth, triggering a re-
lapse.
Repealing this ban tackles a known
problem in our healthcare system, and
I urge support for this bipartisan
amendment.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam
Chair, I claim time in opposition, al-
though I am not opposed to this
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5
minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam
Chair, first off, I thank Representative
FOSTER and also his acting chief of
staff, Samantha Warren, for the great
work on this and for working along
with two of the people on my staff,
Kevin Dawson and Brendan Fulmer. It
is this type of collaboration that
proves to the American people that we
can do things together and do them
right.
Everything the gentleman just said,
it really rings true with me.
My father was 86 years old when we
had to admit him into the hospital for
some work to be done. As I was sitting
there visiting with him one morning,
the nurses brought in his medication.
He said, ‘‘What are you giving me?’’
The nurse said, ‘‘Well, this is what the
doctors prescribed for you.’’ So he said,
‘‘Could I have the chart at the end of
the bed, please?’’ The nurse said, ‘‘Why
would you want that chart?’’ He said:
‘‘Because what you are giving me
today is something I can’t take. If you
look at the chart, you will find out
that I am right, and what you are giv-
ing me is wrong.’’
I thought it was amazing that an 86-
year-old man knew enough to look at
what he was being given without just
saying, ‘‘Fine, if you think I should
take it, I will take it.’’
When we look at what is happening
today, we are at a point right now
where there is no reason for us to be
having these problems.
According to the 2016 study that the
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER)
talked about, healthcare executives
say that misidentification costs the av-
erage healthcare facility $17.4 million
per year in denied claims and potential
lost revenue.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4561
June 12, 2019
Without the ability for clinicians to
correctly connect a patient with their
medical record, medical errors have
needlessly occurred and lives have been
lost. These are situations that could
have been entirely avoidable had pa-
tients been able to be accurately iden-
tified and matched with their records.
This is a problem that is so dire that
one of our Nation’s leading patient
safety organizations, the ECRI Insti-
tute, named patient misidentification
among the top 10 threats to patient
safety.
There is no reason for that to occur,
not today, not in this world, not with
what we have available to us.
Passing the Foster-Kelly amendment
and removing this outdated ban would
help bring our healthcare system into
the 21st century, improve patient safe-
ty, and save millions of dollars.
I would hope that every Member
shares the same concerns that the gen-
tleman and I have and that we make
sure to look at what is available to us
in the 21st century to make sure these
types of mistakes don’t happen. We
have the ability to do it. Why hold
back?
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Ms. DELAURO), the chair-
woman of the Appropriations Labor,
HHS, Education, and Related Agencies
Subcommittee.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of Congressman FOSTER’s
amendment, a bipartisan amendment
to allow for the creation of a unique
health identifier.
We must do all we can to bring down
the skyrocketing costs of healthcare. A
universal and interoperable patient
identifier could do so by reducing
avoidable administrative errors.
Inaccurate patient information costs
patients $2,000 per inpatient stay and
$800 per ER visit, according to a 2018
survey by Black Book Market Re-
search.
We could improve patient matching,
reduce avoidable errors, and bring
down costs if we stop tying the hands
of the Department of Health and
Human Services with regard to uni-
versal identifiers. As Pew Trusts re-
ported in 2018, ‘‘The ban has limited
government actions to collaborate with
the private sector on solutions.’’
Let us reduce skyrocketing
healthcare costs by reducing avoidable
medical administrative errors. I urge
my colleagues to support the amend-
ment.
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Chair, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
I would like to again thank my col-
league from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLY),
for cosponsoring this bipartisan
amendment so that we can move our
healthcare system into the 21st cen-
tury to save money and, most impor-
tantly, to save lives.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

tleman from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER).
The question was taken; and the Act-

to consider amendment No. 21 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-

insert ‘‘(increased by $1)’’.
Page 66, line 14, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(reduced by $1)’’.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Illinois.
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Chair, I would
like to thank Congressman ANDY KIM
for cosponsoring this amendment.
This simple amendment would add
and remove $1 from the substance
abuse treatment fund, which we intend
as a signal that HHS should prioritize
opioid treatment money where the
science shows that it actually works,
on medication-assisted treatment.
Unfortunately, addiction is an issue
that we have become all too familiar
with in our communities and across
the country. It has claimed too many
loved ones, shattered too many lives,
and broken too many families.
It is a devastating reality that drug
overdoses have surpassed motor vehicle
accidents as the leading cause of in-
jury-related deaths in the United
States. In fact, more people die in a
single year from overdoses than were
killed during the entire Vietnam war.
This is a public crisis that affects
people of every race, every income
group, and every education level. These
are mothers and fathers. They are
friends and neighbors.
Honestly, when I was first elected to
Congress, I was not prepared for the
numbers and the types of stories that I
heard from family members who have
lost loved ones to substance abuse.
The urgency of this deadly epidemic
requires us to work together and work
smart as a community and a Nation to
fight back. It requires that we use the
best available science and spend our
money where we know it does the most
good.
We should implement evidence-based
treatment options, and research has
backed medication-assisted treatment.
Studies have shown that medication-
assisted treatment decreases opioid
use, opioid overdose deaths, criminal
activity, and infectious disease trans-
mission.
These studies also show that medica-
tion-assisted treatment increases so-
cial functioning and retention in treat-
ment. Patients treated with medica-
tion are more likely to remain in ther-
apy compared to patients receiving
treatment that did not include medica-
tion.
It is also important in the tragic case
of pregnant women who are addicted to
opioids. A 2012 study by the American
College of Obstetricians and Gyne-
cologists found that the treatment of
opioid-dependent pregnant women with
buprenorphine improved outcomes for
their babies and that medication-as-
sisted treatment reduced withdrawal
systems in newborns and decreased the
length of hospital stays.
Medication-assisted treatment
works, and it is what we should be
funding.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO).
b 1945
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of this amendment.
As noted in the report accompanying
the underlying bill that we are consid-
ering, relapse following opioid detoxi-
fication is a contributing factor to the
overdose crisis.
Medication-assisted treatment pro-
vides a whole-patient approach to the
treatment of substance use disorders,
especially opioids. In combination with
counseling and behavioral therapies,
FDA-approved medications are used to
treat substance misuse to prevent re-
lapse and to sustain recovery.
This amendment calls for the
prioritization of funding for medica-
tion-assisted treatment at the Sub-
stance Abuse and Mental Health Serv-
ices Administration. As part of our
commitment to support people to enter
into treatment, to be in sustained re-
covery, medication-assisted treatment
is an effective option.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment.
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Chair, the
opioid epidemic has claimed too many
lives and torn apart too many families
for us to be using anything but the
most effective treatments.
It is past time that we stop treating
opioid addiction as a moral failing and
start treating it like the treatable
medical condition that it is.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment to make
sure that HHS prioritizes funding for
medically assisted treatment.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. KIM. Madam Chair, earlier this month, I
held a town hall in Toms River, New Jersey,
focused on the opioid and addiction crisis.
At this town hall, and nearly every day since
I was sworn in to represent the Third District
of New Jersey, I have heard heartbreaking
stories from people in my community on how
they’ve struggled with opioid addiction issues.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4562 June 12, 2019
The bill we’re debating today provides im-
portant funding to fight this epidemic.
This amendment directs that funding to
prioritize funding for medication assisted treat-
ment.
This treatment is proven to make a positive
impact in the lives of those dealing with these
issues and proven to save lives.
According to the CDC, more than 70,000
Americans died in 2017 due to drug
overdoses. Reducing that number should be
an absolute priority of this Congress and is the
intent of this amendment.
I want to thank Congressman FOSTER for
his leadership on this issue and urge support
and passage.

AMENDMENT NO. 22 OFFERED BY MR. FOSTER
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 22 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 27, line 20, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(increased by $1)’’.
Page 27, line 20, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(reduced by $1)’’.

House Resolution 431, the gentleman

utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Illinois.
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Chair, my
amendment highlights the need to
think about our future workforce and
how it will change because of tech-
nology, and to encourage the Bureau of
Labor Statistics to accept a wider and
more forward-looking range of inputs
into its range of projections for the
workforce of the future and that BLS
should conduct the Contingent Worker
and Alternative Work Arrangement
Supplement to the Current Population
Survey more frequently.
I co-chair the New Democrat Coali-
tion’s Future of Work Task Force with
my colleagues Congresswoman LISA
BLUNT ROCHESTER, Congressman CHRIS
PAPPAS, and Congresswoman HALEY
STEVENS, all of whom have cosponsored
this amendment.
The Future of Work Task Force has
held a series of forums to hear from ex-
perts on various areas that will require
this body’s attention in the coming
years and decades.
Last Congress, we heard from histo-
rians, economists, and policy experts
about how technological revolutions of
the past have impacted social and po-
litical institutions, and the lessons
from those experiences and from our
current conditions that can help us
prepare for the future.
We have also heard from labor and
business leaders who are pioneering
new ways to attract talent, to retain
the services of skilled employees, and
to develop skills for the increasingly
rapidly changing economy.
It is nearly unanimous among our ex-
perts that the economy will change sig-
nificantly and change faster, but it is
less clear just how quickly the work-
force will need to adapt.
For decades, the Bureau of Labor
Statistics has been doing excellent and
invaluable work to track our labor
trends, and its projections have proven
very reliable and useful to businesses
and to our educators in times of slower
and relatively predictable techno-
logical development.
However, they are based on back-
ward-looking historical data and his-
torical trends, and some of the antici-
pated changes in technology, such as
robotics, self-driving vehicles, and arti-
ficial intelligence could fundamentally
change our economies in ways that we
haven’t seen before and are not pre-
paring for.
So in its current form, the way that
the Bureau calculates and estimates
future development of the workforce
may not be able to capture the dra-
matic changes that our future holds.
One panel convened by the task force
suggested that it would be difficult or
impossible to do projections in any sin-
gle way to predict the future of the
workforce, but with additional re-
sources, the Bureau of Labor Statistics
could model for a variety of scenarios
of different rates of technological
change in different sectors.
My amendment increases the BLS
amount by a dollar and decreases it by
a dollar, which we intend to signal that
the BLS should submit to Congress an
estimate of the resources it would need
to make a range of forward-looking es-
timates, including consultation with
those industries that are driving the
rapid technological change and those
industries that will be affected by that
change to account for the increasing
rate of technological job displacement.
Technological changes to the work-
force are not new. The industrial revo-
lution and the automation of agri-
culture transformed the way work was
performed in our country, and signifi-
cantly improved, on the whole, our
standard of living over time, but the
benefits have not been uniform and all
communities and all job sectors have
not benefited equally.
Past transformations have typically
played out over generations so that our
social and political institutions had
ample time to respond, but today, the
development and deployment of our
technology is far more rapid, and Con-
gress, business, and our educational
system need the best possible data to
evaluate policy proposals and to
produce the workforce training needed
for future employees, to develop edu-
cational curricula, and ensure that our
economy works for everyone.
Like the industrial revolution, tech-
nological development presents the op-
portunity for greatly improved stand-
ards of living, but it will also bring
challenges to our workforce.
Businesses, communities, and gov-
ernment must work together.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to join me in voting ‘‘yes’’ on my
amendment, to begin to establish a
range of planning scenarios from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics for the fu-
ture world that we will all inhabit.
Madam Chair, I thank my Future
Work Task Force co-chairs, Congress-
woman HALEY STEVENS, Congressman
CHRIS PAPPAS and Congresswoman LISA
BLUNT ROCHESTER, for cosponsoring

As the only Ph.D. physicist in Con-
gress, I feel a special responsibility to
speak out on issues of national secu-
rity, especially when they concern
emerging technological threats that
Congress may not be sufficiently aware
of.
For more than 70 years, nuclear
weapons have held center stage among
the threats to our national security
and global safety because of their capa-
bilities to threaten the existence of all
mankind.

June 12, 2019
However, the dangers posed by ad-
vanced biological threats are catching
up fast.
For example, the ability of genome
editing tools, such as CRISPR/Cas9, to
delete, suppress, and amplify specific
genes has been a long sought-after ca-
pability for treating monogenic dis-
orders and other disorders.
However, this ability could also be
abused for nefarious purposes, such as
disrupting the normal function of par-
ticular biological systems or
weaponizing synthetic versions of a
virus.
This is a global issue that will re-
quire global solutions.
Unfortunately, the advances in this
field are outpacing our ability to de-
velop policies that will set inter-
national ethical and regulatory frame-
works.
Diagnostic platforms that can rap-
idly detect and characterize bioagents
will become increasingly critical to
safeguarding human health.
If we are going to stay ahead of these
technological threats, we need to be
strategic about our investments.
As a leader in technology and innova-
tion, the United States must act now
to mitigate any dangers that these
technologies might pose.
Madam Chair, the $1 million allo-
cated by this amendment represents
truly only a fraction of what will ulti-
mately be needed, but I urge my col-
leagues to join me and vote ‘‘yes’’ on
my amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.

Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Chair, I rise in support of this
amendment. The underlying bill that
we are considering includes a $5 mil-
lion increase to HHS’ Biomedical Ad-
vanced Research and Development Au-
thority, BARDA.
This organization has the significant
responsibility to help counter biologi-
cal threats and other challenges to do-
mestic and global health security and
safety, while fostering scientific
progress.
This amendment would provide an
additional $1 million specifically for
biosecurity research and development,
further supporting efforts to accelerate
the development of emerging tech-
nologies and products vital to our na-
tional security.
Research and development invest-
ments help our Nation to be prepared
for a wide range of chemical, biologi-
cal, radiological, and nuclear threats;
pandemic influenza; and emerging in-

Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, I rise
today to offer an amendment in sup-
port of vaccines and their medical ef-
fectiveness. Specifically, my amend-
ment would direct $5 million to am-
plify a public health campaign to pro-
mote vaccine usage and combat hesi-
tancy.
These funds would support the work
of the National Vaccine Program with-
in the Office of Infectious Disease and
HIV/AIDS Policy, which provides a
framework for pursuing the prevention
of infectious diseases through immuni-
zations.
It is the Nation’s leading roadmap in
articulating a comprehensive strategy
to develop new and improved vaccines,
enhance the vaccine safety system, and
support communications to enhance
vaccine decisionmaking.
Each year, vaccines are estimated to
save 2 to 3 million lives worldwide. Due
to effective vaccination campaigns,
what were once referred to as the usual
diseases of childhood are now consid-
ered vaccine-preventable diseases.
Unfortunately, vaccines are a victim
of their own success. These monu-
mental public health achievements
have contributed to a false perception
that disease threats are minimal, and
that routine vaccination is no longer
necessary.
This year alone, we have witnessed
numerous outbreaks of measles across
the country, a disease that was once
considered eradicated in the United
States.
Declining vaccination rates pose an
imminent threat to public health. In
fact, the World Health Organization
has identified vaccine hesitancy as a
top global health threat for 2019.
b 2000
There is strong evidence to suggest
that at least part of the source of this
trend is the degree to which medically
inaccurate information about vaccines
surfaces on websites where many
Americans get their information.
Repetition of information, even if
false, can often be mistaken for accu-
racy, and exposure to antivaccine con-
tent via social media may negatively
shape user attitudes towards vaccina-
tion.
The emergence of vaccine hesitancy
as an increasingly common theme in
healthcare settings demands attention,
and it is imperative for public health
officials to take a necessary and crit-
ical step to flip the script from vaccine
hesitancy to vaccine confidence to pro-
tect and bolster the public health.
The scientific and medical commu-
nities are in overwhelming consensus
that vaccines are both effective and
safe. There is no evidence to suggest
that vaccines cause life-threatening or
disabling diseases, and the dissemina-
tion of unfounded or debunked theories
about the dangers of vaccination pose a
great risk to the public health.
Support for the national vaccine pro-
gram and coordinating a national pub-
lic health campaign to fight vaccine
misinformation is imperative. It is es-
sential, now more than ever, that we
fund vaccine communication research
to strengthen the evidence base for
what works in fighting vaccine hesi-
tance, combating misinformation, and
encouraging responsible vaccine deci-
sionmaking.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO), the chairwoman of the Ap-
propriations Subcommittee on Labor,
Health and Human Services, Edu-
cation, and Related Agencies.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of this amendment. As noted
in the report accompanying the under-
lying bill that we are considering, the
current measles outbreak that has
cases confirmed in 28 States, including
in my State of Connecticut and in my
colleague’s State of California, high-
lights the importance of immuniza-
tions.
Vaccines are one of the greatest suc-
cess stories in public health. They are
the most effective way to protect the
public from highly infectious and po-
tentially deadly diseases.
This amendment highlights efforts
conducted by the Department of Health
and Human Services to understand the
reasons that people do not vaccinate
themselves and their children, as well
as to combat misinformation about
vaccines. What we need is, through re-
search, to dispel that misinformation
which is, in fact, today, right now, put-
ting the lives of our children and fami-
lies at risk.
Vaccines are safe; they are effective;
and I urge my colleagues to support
this lifesaving amendment.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, I thank
the chair for her support.
This amendment sends a clear mes-
sage to the American people that Con-

Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of this bipartisan amend-
ment to H.R. 2740.
Last fall, President Trump signed
into law the comprehensive opioid
package. Included in that package was
the POWER Act, which provides com-
petitive grants to hospitals in high-
overdose or rural areas. Sadly, Con-
gress has not yet funded that program.
The grants included in the POWER
Act will help provide emergency rooms
the resources they need to offer over-
dose patients not only short-term care,
but the long-term treatment that is
proven to help prevent repeat
overdoses.
This bipartisan amendment, intro-
duced with my colleague from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE), would
fund the grant program with the $10
million Congress has already pre-
viously authorized.
Madam Chairman, if we believe this
is a good program and we voted to au-
thorize it, then let’s vote for this
amendment and fund it.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I claim
the time in opposition, although I do
not oppose the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR (Ms. TITUS). With-
out objection, the gentlewoman from
Connecticut is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
There was no objection.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of this, in fact, bipartisan
amendment.
Drug overdose deaths continue to in-
crease in the United States. Nearly 70
percent of these deaths involve an
opioid. It is staggering that, on aver-
age, 130 Americans die every day from
an opioid overdose.
This amendment provides $10 million
for a new program at the Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad-
ministration, SAMHSA, to develop best
practices for emergency treatment and
the coordination and continuation of
care for overdose patients.
By providing overdose reversal medi-
cations, we can save lives. By providing
overdose reversal medication, we can, I
will repeat it, save lives.
We have no higher calling in this in-
stitution than to save lives. Those who
have experienced a nonfatal drug over-
dose can benefit from evidence-based,
long-term treatment to prevent relapse
and future overdoses.
I urge my colleagues to support this
bipartisan amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Chairman,
again, let’s do something novel here.
Let’s do what we say we were going to

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentleman
from North Carolina (Mr.
BUTTERFIELD) and a Member opposed
each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from North Carolina.
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Chair, I
know it has been a long evening and we
have several hours in front of us, so I
will try to be brief.
Madam Chair, I rise in support of my
amendment to provide funding for the
expansion of the National Survey of
Child and Adolescent Well-Being to in-
clude data collection on the child vic-
tims of parental substance abuse, espe-
cially those of the opioid epidemic.
As this epidemic continues, Madam
Chair, the child welfare system across
the country is being overwhelmed.
That is the report that we are getting.
They are just absolutely being over-
whelmed.
In my home State of North Carolina,
foster care placements have been on
the rise. In 2016, over 5,600 children
were placed in foster care, and in 38
percent of infant placements, parental
substance abuse was a factor. As my
colleagues unfortunately know, similar
increases have occurred all across the
country.
The NSCAW is the only national sur-
vey that provides longitudinal data on
children who have been involved in
State child protective services pro-
grams. It helps examine the current
characteristics and needs of children
and families involved with child pro-
tective services and helps to examine
efforts to improve child and family
well-being. However, it does not gather
detailed information about the unique
service needs of child victims of the
opioid epidemic, their parents, their
caregivers, or their child welfare pro-
fessionals.
This amendment will help fill this in-
formation gap by providing funding to
expand data collection for those child
victims of parental substance abuse,
positioning the NSCAW to be the
source for critical information on the
impacts and the needs of child victims
of the opioid epidemic.
My amendment will fill the holes
that currently exist in our data collec-
tion for these children and enable us to
fully understand the critical service
needs of these children. This data will
empower caseworkers and child welfare
agency administrators to provide the
best services and supports for these
children and their families.
Our communities are suffering. All of
my colleagues know that. Our commu-
nities are suffering from substance
abuse and the opioid crisis, especially
children, who are the most vulnerable
in these communities. We must have
the necessary information needed to
better understand the full impact these
children and their families are experi-
encing in order to provide for their
needs. I think all of us on both sides of
the aisle, hopefully, can agree on this.
I want to thank the chair of the sub-
committee for her friendship and her
support for this, and I strongly encour-
age my colleagues to support this
amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the

opioid epidemic. This additional fund-
ing would build upon existing data ef-
forts and provide child welfare case-
workers with evidence-based data that
can better inform how children are
cared for if they are in the system be-
cause of parental substance abuse.

Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Madam Chair,
I have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

House Resolution 431, the gentleman
from Ohio (Mr. JOHNSON) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Ohio.
Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Madam Chair,
my amendment would address the on-
going opioid crisis by funding the Re-
gional Centers of Excellence in Sub-
stance Use Disorder Education, which
was authorized last year as a part of
H.R. 6. This program aims to increase
the amount of education that health
professional students receive on sub-
stance use disorder, pain management,
and addiction.
While health professional students
are eager to address addiction and the
opioid epidemic, only a handful of med-
ical schools have robust curriculums
on the diagnosis and treatment of sub-
stance use disorders. By recognizing in-
stitutions that have put a focus on
these areas and sharing their strategies
publicly, we hope to ensure that the
next generation of health professionals
are fully prepared to address the opioid
epidemic and other forms of addiction.
Healthcare providers are in a unique
position to recognize a patient suf-
fering from addiction, and it is impor-
tant that their training fully prepares
them to take on this important and po-
tentially lifesaving role.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I claim
the time in opposition, although I do

The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-

There was no objection.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of this bipartisan amend-
ment.
This amendment calls for funding of
a new program at the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Adminis-
tration. In fact, it would establish its
Regional Centers of Excellence in Sub-
stance Use Disorder Education.
In 2017, approximately 19 million
adults had a substance use disorder.
This program would improve the train-
ing of health professionals in substance
use disorder prevention, treatment,
and recovery so that more people can
get treatment and we can reduce the
number of those who do need treat-
ment. Part of this is to be able to edu-
cate and train folks to be able to deal
with the scale and the scope of this
public health emergency, which is what
I call it, across the Nation.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Madam Chair,
I thank my colleague for supporting

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentlewoman
from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Wisconsin.
Ms. MOORE. Madam Chair, my
amendment relates to the Centers for
Disease Control, establishing a na-
tional standard for investigating child-
hood deaths from sudden infant death
syndrome.
The death of a child, Madam Chair, is
always a tragedy, but the unexplained
nature of some of these deaths only
makes it harder for grieving families,
as well as public health officials and
policymakers who are working to pre-
vent them.
I have had the heartrending experi-
ence of walking into the home of par-
ents who are grieving. That grief
doesn’t just begin when their infant
dies, but goes on for a lifetime, won-
dering: Was it my fault? Could I have
done something? Am I a bad parent?
My amendment would help us better
understand why thousands of infants
between the age of birth and 1, and
hundreds of children between the ages
of 1 and 4, are still dying unexpectedly
in our country. These deaths include
those from sudden infant death syn-
drome.
Scarlett Lillian Pauley was one of
those children, Madam Chair. Scarlett
loved her pets, including her dog,
Stitch, who she called ‘‘Sitch,’’ and her
cat, Colby, who she called ‘‘Max’’ or
‘‘Maps.’’
Scarlett loved to smile. She loved
books. Her favorite book was ‘‘Barn-
yard Dance’’ by Sandra Boynton, which
her mom read to her right before she
put her to sleep on January 7, 2017. A
few hours later, her mama went to
check on her and Scarlett was not
breathing in her crib. After being
taken to the hospital, this beautiful 16-
month-old baby was declared dead on
January 8, 2017.
That is just one story. In 2017, there
were 3,600 infants who died suddenly
and unexpectedly, according to CDC
data, including 1,400 from SIDS.
Right now, without a national stand-
ard for how to investigate these deaths,
different States and different munici-
palities collect inconsistent and often
incomplete data on these unexplained
sudden deaths. That hinders the ability
to find answers.
I am so pleased that Chairwoman
DELAURO has included funding in the
base bill for the CDC to increase efforts
to better train those who carry out
stronger death investigations and im-
prove data collection.
Madam Chair, how much time do I
have remaining?

from Wisconsin has 2 minutes remain-

Ms. MOORE. Madam Chair, I thank
the ranking member, Mr. COLE, who is
a leading cosponsor of my stand-alone
legislation to help families that see
their children and infants die suddenly
get some resolution.
This is an example of smart invest-
ments in our healthcare sprinkled
throughout this bill.
Madam Chair, I yield the balance of
my time to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Ms. DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of this amendment.
I would note, as my colleague, Con-
gresswoman MOORE, noted, the under-
lying bill under consideration today in-
cludes $2 million for a new dedicated
effort on sudden unexpected infant
death and sudden unexplained death in
childhood at the CDC. Despite the de-
cline in the rate of sudden unexpected
infant death in the past two decades,
significant racial and ethnic dif-
ferences continue. CDC is working to
better understand the circumstances
that may increase risks, so that public
awareness and provider education can
be improved to reduce these risks.
I strongly support the Congress-
woman’s efforts to prevent these tragic
deaths of very young children and the
profound suffering of their families.
I just say to my colleagues, those
who are here and who are not here,
think about the power of the institu-
tion that we serve in and what it can
do in so many of these areas to pro-
foundly change people’s lives, to save
people’s lives, and to give people com-
fort to know that we have not forgot-
ten them, and that while they have ex-
perienced a tragedy, we will work to
see that others will not have to face a

dren.

Ms. MOORE. Madam Chair, this
amendment would provide $4.5 million
in additional funding for the CDC’s Do-
mestic Violence Prevention Enhance-
ment and Leadership Through Alli-
ances, also known as DELTA, program
to reach the level that the domestic vi-
olence advocates have made clear that
they need to adequately support this
effort.
The DELTA program is dedicated to
the prevention of domestic violence.
While most Federal programs provide
victim services, or hold perpetrators
accountable, and train healthcare pro-
viders and others to spot or respond to
domestic violence, the DELTA program
works directly with over 50 commu-
nities nationwide to prevent first-time
victims and to prevent first-time per-
petrators of domestic violence.
With one in three women and one in
four men experiencing intimate part-
ner violence in their lifetimes, we need
this funding now more than ever.
This program works with stake-
holders, activists, and mentors to
teach youth about sexual assault and
teen dating violence while promoting
healthy relationships.
This investment was important in
my home State of Wisconsin, where the
DELTA program created meaningful
initiatives among our Tribal commu-
nities, like the Oneida’s Wise Women
Gathering Place and Milwaukee’s own
Diverse & Resilient organization that
worked with LGBTQ youth on safe re-
lationships.
Madam Chair, I yield the balance of
my time to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Ms. DELAURO), chairwoman
of the subcommittee.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of this amendment.
Intimate partner violence is a seri-
ous, preventable public health problem
that affects millions of Americans.
This amendment would increase fund-
ing for CDC’s efforts to work in com-
munities to implement proven preven-
tion strategies, including programs
that mobilize boys and men to be allies
in sexual violence prevention, and coa-
litions with local governments, com-
munity partners, and police to increase
safe spaces in neighborhood parks.
The negative consequences associ-
ated with intimate partner violence
underscore the importance of stopping
it before it occurs. I commend the
amendment sponsors for raising atten-
tion to this important program.

to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment.

Ms. MOORE. Madam Chair, this
amendment to add funding to the Sub-
stance Abuse and Mental Health Serv-
ices Administration would support the
distribution of fentanyl test strips by
our State and local public health part-
ners.
Unintentional drug overdose deaths
have climbed to record high levels,
claiming around 70,000 lives in the
United States in 2017. One of the driv-
ers is fentanyl, a powerful synthetic
opioid that is significantly more potent
than heroin. Because fentanyl is so
cheap and strong, dealers have an in-
centive to use it to cut drugs such as
heroin and cocaine.
In New York City in 2017—just to
name one locality, but the story is the
same in many other places—fentanyl
was involved in 57 percent of all the
drug overdose deaths. Between 2000 and
2012, that rate was only 2 percent, but
in 2017 it was much higher.
This crisis, a public health epidemic
and emergency, means that we need to
bring more tools to the fight. While
some agencies, like the NIH, have
noted the need to consider all evidence-
based programs that can help address
the damage being caused in our com-
munities by opioids, others, like
SAMHSA, have clearly not, which is
troubling.
In April, the NIH awarded a grant to
the University of Kentucky that aimed
at reducing opioid overdose deaths by
40 percent in 16 counties using evi-
dence-based solutions. One of the evi-
dence-based solutions that could be
pursued would be using these funds in
overdose prevention efforts, such as
naloxone distribution and fentanyl test
strip distribution.
Unfortunately, it appears that
SAMHSA has taken the opposite

stance and has warned its grantees
against funding such efforts. This is
perplexing, Madam Chair, since it re-
ceives hundreds of millions of dollars
from this Congress to address the
opioid crisis, including overdoses.
What is a fentanyl strip? Fentanyl
strips are used to detect the presence
of fentanyl in drugs. While there are
other ways to detect the presence of
fentanyl in drugs, testing strips are
more sensitive and significantly less
expensive than other methods.
Madam Chair, studies have found this
approach works to positively influence
behavior. Recent studies have found
that using these strips can be helpful
to reduce fentanyl overdose risks, in-
cluding leading some individuals to
discard their drug supply or taking
some other action to reduce harm to
themselves.
In one study, those who saw the posi-
tive results were five times more likely
to change the way they used the drug
in an effort to avoid overdosing, and so
people want to make moral judgments
about it.
Sure, we need to provide rehabilita-
tion services to people, Madam Chair,
but it is impossible to rehab someone
who is dead.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time, and I withdraw my
amendment.

Ms. MATSUI. Madam Chair, I am
pleased to join my colleagues today in
supporting critical investments made
by this bill. I rise today in support of
my amendment, which will provide ad-
ditional assistance for innovative pro-
grams that will help young people with
developmental disabilities in obtaining
and sustaining long-term employment.
Madam Chair, 1 in 68 children are di-
agnosed with autism spectrum dis-
order. More than 50,000 individuals
with autism turn 18 every year, and
500,000 will age out of school systems in
the next 10 years.
A significant number of young adults
with autism spectrum disorder remain
unemployed and unenrolled in higher
education in the 2 years after high
school. Young adults on the autism
spectrum often do not have access to
an educational environment that can
assist them in developing practical life
skills, increase social capacity, and
transition to work and independence.
This amendment is a critical first
step towards remedying that. Specifi-
cally, it will help support and promote
innovative educational programs and
focus on preparing students for entry
into the workforce or pursuing higher
education.
The support offered through these
initiative programs helps young adults
find and maintain employment. In
turn, this is a critical step towards
independence, an opportunity to be
more productive and to fully partici-
pate in all facets of community life.
My amendment will support young
adults with developmental disabilities
access care and education necessary to
find jobs by focusing on inclusion and
integration.
It is critically important that all
children and young adults, particularly
those who are challenged with autism,
have the opportunity to fully partici-
pate in our communities and society. I
hope my colleagues will join me in sup-
porting this amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentlewoman from Connecticut
(Ms. DELAURO), my dear friend and sub-
committee chair.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
Madam Chair, I rise to support the
Developmental Disabilities Projects of
National Significance program, which
is why this bill rejects the administra-
tion’s proposal to virtually eliminate
funding for it—why?—and instead pro-
vides a $1 million increase over the fis-
cal year 2019 level.
These grants fund innovative
projects that create opportunities for
those with developmental disabilities.
They promote quality of opportunity
and inclusion of persons with disabil-
ities in all aspects of community life,
which benefits our society as a whole.
I thank the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. MATSUI), my friend, for
highlighting this particular grant ini-
tiative for schools that serve young
adults on the autism spectrum by help-
ing them develop practical life skills
that will help them transition to work
and independence.
We need innovative programs like
this one that create and enhance op-
portunities for individuals with devel-
opmental disabilities to contribute to,
to participate in, to feel their value, to
know that we recognize their value and
give them respect and independence
and self-confidence in who they are.
This means that they can participate
in all facets of community life.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment.
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Chair, I add to
this, too, if I may, the program sup-
ported by this amendment offers oppor-
tunities for young adults with intellec-
tual disabilities to be placed in paid
jobs, internships, or volunteer posi-
tions. Often, the individuals who par-
ticipate are extremely passionate and
capable about a work opportunity but
simply need a little help along the way.
I think we can all agree that learning
opportunities to better train and en-
courage these young adults to seek and
maintain long-term work is a goal we
all support. These problem-solving
abilities and confidence gained in the
right environment can have a lasting,
long-term impact on those with au-
tism.
Madam Chair, I feel that this is
something that will really help the in-
dividuals whom I have met along the
way, and I strongly urge my colleagues
to join me in supporting this amend-
ment.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tlewoman from California (Ms. MAT-
SUI).
The question was taken; and the Act-

Mr. BARR. Madam Chair, I rise today
to offer my amendment to increase
funding for the Building Communities
of Recovery program.
We all know that the opioid epidemic
is a major health crisis that has im-
pacted every community and every
congressional district. My home State
of Kentucky suffers from the fifth
highest overdose mortality rate in the
country, and we learned from the CDC
that last year 72,000 of our fellow citi-
zens died of an opioid overdose. This is
a national crisis.
Last fall, Congress passed a historic
package of legislation to address the
opioid epidemic to research treatment
and prevention. The SUPPORT for Pa-
tients and Communities Act builds
upon past resources authorized and

funded by Congress, including the 21st
Century Cures Act and the Comprehen-
sive Addiction and Recovery Act.
Additionally, Congress has appro-
priated $4 billion, the largest Federal
investment to date, to address the
opioid epidemic, but there is more
work to be done. We cannot continue
to focus our Federal efforts on preven-
tion and treatment without looking to-
ward long-term recovery through hous-
ing, job placement, financial literacy,
and life skills.
Not all recovery is the same. Every-
one has a different recovery journey,
and we must not prioritize one path-
way to recovery over another. If there
is one thing I have learned talking to
folks who are struggling through an
addiction recovery is that what works
for one individual may not work for an-
other.
I have heard from my constituents of
the need for funding to be made avail-
able for programs that provide alter-
natives to medication-assisted treat-
ment for opioid use disorder. Obvi-
ously, medication-assisted treatment
is considered evidence-based and the
gold standard in many cases for help-
ing people to recovery, but there are
alternatives, and some individuals need
a different course.
Currently, the Building Communities
of Recovery program is one of the only
sources of funding for nonmedication
for opioid-use disorder.
b 2045
According to SAMHSA, non-MAT
programs are ineligible for the State
Opioid Response Grants which con-
stitute the majority of opioid funding.
My office has been told time and
time again that the reason they cannot
receive funding is because they do not
offer medication-assisted treatment.
I would like to emphasize that I am
not critical of medication-assisted
treatment programs, but I do believe
that non-narcotic alternatives to re-
covery complement medication-as-
sisted treatment for certain individ-
uals.
As we continue to combat this crisis,
we must make critical, nonmedication
resources for recovery available to
those who need them. Treatment pro-
grams that choose to offer non-MAT
recovery options are doing incredible
work despite their inability to access
most Federal grant programs that we
enacted last year.
I would like to highlight the story of
Zachary Thomas, my constituent, and
a prime example of someone who suc-
cessfully worked through addiction to
recovery. At the age of 18, Zach
dropped out of Mercer County Senior
High School just 4 months before grad-
uation. He was hooked on
methamphetamines, heroin, and alco-
hol and was homeless.
At age 19, Zach was in the Boyle
County Detention Center on drug
charges. Upon recommendation of the
county attorney, Zach was sent to the
Shepherd’s House, a recovery residence
in Lexington, Kentucky, that provides
transitional residential treatment for
men 18 years and older.
Shepherd’s House has been providing
treatment for clients who suffer from
drug and alcohol issues for the past 30
years. It offers structured programs
that promote personal responsibility
and accountability for those seeking
sustained abstinence from mood and
mind-altering substances.
Zach now works at DV8 Kitchen, a
Lexington restaurant owned by Rob
and Diane Perez that has a practice of
hiring employees in recovery from drug
and alcohol addictions.
Zach’s success is just one example of
the great work of the people at the
Shepherd’s House and the great work
that these nonmedication-assisted
treatment recovery programs are doing
to combat this crisis.
The Shepherd’s House’s desire is to
live in the solution of recovery, to
make a positive economic impact on
the communities we serve, and to one
day put a small dent in the national
crisis that we know as addiction.
Another example I would like to
highlight is my good friend, Jenell
Brewer, in Powell County, Kentucky,
the SPARK program. It is an advocacy
center that helps families navigate ad-
diction, educates them on addiction,
and connects them with recovery re-
sources in the State. At a time when
many families don’t know what to do,
SPARK offers a personal approach and
an outlet for those coping with this cri-
sis.
But these great organizations,
SPARK and the Shepherd’s House, are
not eligible for many of the Federal
grant programs that we have funded.
And so this amendment would simply
provide increased funding for that pro-
gram, the Building Communities of Re-
covery program that would provide
funding for these alternatives that are
desperately needed.
I encourage my colleagues to vote in
favor of the amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I claim
the time in opposition, although I do
not oppose the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of this amendment. I appre-
ciate my colleague offering this
amendment. I am a strong supporter of
recovery support services, and I recog-
nize their essential role in the recovery
of individuals with substance use dis-
orders.
In my district in Connecticut, I have
met with my own constituents who
credit their recoveries and often their
lives to recovery coaches.
I met with constituents who were
substance-use abusers, but also with
the providers, and they all said to me
very specifically that one of the dif-
ficulties is that someone can get treat-
ment, and then they go back out onto
the street, but they have no one to be
in touch with as a support system in
order to be able to continue on a road
to recovery. They slip back, and they
are then once again on the street.
What you are talking about is in-
creasing the funding for building com-
munities of recovery so that people
don’t feel that they are alone and that
there is nowhere to go, but to take up
an unhealthy lifestyle once again.
This bill will expand access to crit-
ical and lifesaving services, including
recovery support from drug or alcohol
addiction, primary care, housing serv-
ices, and employment services. Maybe
we could put together some number, a
211 number, that a person can call, and
they can be referred on employment,
and housing, and the kinds of services
that people need when they find them-
selves in this situation.
So I commend my colleague on this
amendment, and I urge my colleagues
to support the amendment.
I yield back the balance of my time.

stance Abuse and Mental Health Serv-

June 12, 2019
statistics surpassed that of our Na-
tion’s average on almost every ac-
count, from every age group to race
and ethnicity.
The 2018 Missouri High School Prin-
cipal of the Year, Jeff Meisenheimer,
came to my office recently. His chief
concern was that our youth today are
in distress; that suicide rates are ris-
ing; and school personnel need re-
sources to help these vulnerable stu-
dents.
Two years ago in his school, Lee’s
Summit North High School, which is
located in my district, a hardworking,
young woman with a contagious smile
named Gemesha Thomas died by sui-
cide in the school. She actually went in
the girl’s restroom and shot herself.
My grandson was at the school at the
time, and they evacuated the school. I
was actually speaking with him by
phone from here. He was outside trying
to figure out what was going on.
This is a tragedy. There is no other
word for it, but we have got to do all
we can to try to help prevent this. Dis-
turbingly, this situation is becoming
more and more common and we have to
do something about it.
These tragedies do not exist in a vac-
uum. According to the Jason Founda-
tion, four out of five teens who attempt
suicide give clear warning signs.
Madam Chair, I want to applaud the
committee’s commitment on this issue
and the increase in funding for youth
suicide prevention in this bill. How-
ever, we must do more. This is why I
propose an increase in funding for the
Garrett Lee Smith Campus Suicide
Prevention grant program because it
puts resources in the hands of those
who are on the front lines of training
for our future.
Let’s do everything within our power
to reduce death by suicide and give our
future leaders a fighting chance.
I yield such time as she may consume
to the gentlewoman from Connecticut
(Ms. DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of this amendment. Suicide
is devastating communities across our
country as evidenced by more than
47,000 deaths in 2017. It makes me proud
that what we put together in the un-
derlying bill that we consider tonight
includes $20 million of new funding for
suicide prevention efforts at the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention
and the Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration.
This amendment would increase
funding for efforts to prevent suicide
among our youth at the places that
many of them can be found: colleges
and universities, and youth-serving or-
ganizations. Through training and ac-
tivities aimed at identifying youth at
risk for suicide, screenings and the
connection to appropriate services are
preventing suicide and suicide at-
tempts.
We shouldn’t be dealing with this
after the fact. But what we ought to be
doing is trying to provide the kinds of
counseling and have people who are
trained to recognize the telltale signs
of a youngster who is in difficulty and
who needs help.
As the underlying bill that we con-
sider shows, we strongly support sui-
cide prevention efforts, and I commend
the gentleman for offering this amend-
ment. I urge my colleagues to support
this amendment.
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Chair, I yield

in part B of House Report 116–109.
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam
Chair, I have an amendment at the
desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division A (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. None of the funds made available
by this Act may be used to implement, ad-
minister, or enforce the rule entitled ‘‘Short-
Term, Limited Duration Insurance’’ pub-
lished by the Department of the Treasury,
the Department of Labor, and the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services in the
Federal Register on August 3, 2018 (83 Fed.
Reg. 38212).
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentlewoman
from Florida (Ms. CASTOR) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida.
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam
Chairwoman, my amendment is an im-
portant one for American families who
are grappling with healthcare costs.
My amendment is an important one
for the over 130 million Americans who
have a preexisting health condition
like cancer, diabetes, heart disease,
asthma, or Alzheimer’s.
My amendment takes aim at a pro-
posed rule by the Trump administra-
tion that encourages insurance compa-
nies to issue junk insurance plans.
Everyone calls them junk insurance
plans because they often don’t cover
vital health services. They may not
cover a trip to the hospital or the
emergency room. They may not cover
prescription drugs. They may not cover
mental health services that you need.
They are often marketed as a good
deal, but they don’t show a person the
fine print that they may cap benefits.
What they do is they allow discrimina-
tion against our neighbors who have a
preexisting health condition.
This is not in question because in
committee, I asked the HHS Secretary
Azar point blank, I said: ‘‘These short-
term, limited-duration plans known as
junk plans, they allow insurance com-
panies to discriminate against you if
you have a preexisting health condi-
tion; right, Mr. Secretary?’’
He said: ‘‘Yes.’’
The law of the land after we passed
the Affordable Care Act says that no
longer are we going to allow insurance
companies to discriminate against our
neighbors who have preexisting health
conditions. So how can the Trump ad-
ministration be moving forward?
Well, they are moving forward with a
proposed rule that would allow these
plans to operate for 1 year, 2 years, or
3 years. That is not a short-term, lim-
ited-duration plan. These are junk.
Just over a month ago, Democrats
here in the House stood up for our
neighbors back home and passed a bill,
H.R. 1010, that would halt the Trump
administration’s dangerous expansion
of junk health plans that weaken the
protection for Americans who have a
preexisting condition.
b 2100
Today, we are building on H.R. 1010
by offering this amendment with my
colleagues, Representatives UNDER-
WOOD, BARRAGAN, DESAULNIER,
SPANBERGER, MOORE, and SLOTKIN, to
prohibit any funds from being used to
implement, administer, or enforce the
administration’s expansion of junk
plans. We are going to safeguard fami-
lies from Republican attempts to push
them into junk insurance plans that
don’t cover the essential healthcare
services that they need.
The mandate from our neighbors
back home is clear. They value afford-
able healthcare and the bedrock pro-
tection of the Affordable Care Act that
prohibits discrimination based upon a
preexisting health condition.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. WOMACK. I claim the time in op-
position to the gentlewoman’s amend-
ment, Madam Chair.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Arkansas is recognized for 5 min-

Mr. WOMACK. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition to the gentlewoman’s
amendment, and count me as one who
stands in support of the Trump admin-
istration’s proposals for short-term,
limited duration health plans and asso-
ciation health insurance plans.
With all due respect to my friend on
the other side of the aisle, this has ev-
erything to do with giving our citizens
options. These plans serve as an afford-
able alternative to ObamaCare health
insurance plans, particularly for indi-
viduals and families not eligible for
ObamaCare tax subsidies.

businesses in my district that say they

can’t afford health insurance for their
employees. These alternative plans,
Madam Chair, can and often do have
lower premiums and deductibles and
provide access to the same healthcare
providers as some of the ObamaCare
plans.
I believe that this amendment needs
to be defeated, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam
Chair, instead of ripping affordable
coverage away, my Republican col-
leagues and the administration should
be working with the Democrats to
lower healthcare costs for American
families and protect coverage for pre-
existing conditions. One way that we
can do that is by supporting this
amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield the balance of
my time to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Ms. DELAURO), who is a
healthcare champion.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in strong support of Congresswoman
CASTOR’s amendment that, in fact,
blocks the Trump administration’s rule
to promote junk health insurance
plans. Plain and simple, that is what
they are.
This is just another attempt by the
administration to sabotage the Afford-
able Care Act. Their policies have in-
creased the costs of healthcare. The
level of uninsured in this Nation has
gone up, and they want to bring us
back to a time when those folks with a
preexisting condition could no longer
get healthcare coverage.
There are some who say that today,
for the first time in their lives, they
have gotten that coverage, and other-
wise, they would have died. Maybe that
doesn’t cut it with some folks here.
Short-term plans do not have to
cover the ACA’s essential health bene-
fits. They frequently do not include
maternity services, prescription drugs,
mental healthcare, or substance use
disorder treatment. Short-term plans
can deny coverage to or charge higher
prices for people with preexisting con-
ditions.
As I said a moment ago, remember
those days when even being a woman
was a preexisting condition. If a child
had asthma, Madam Chair, it was a
preexisting condition, and they
couldn’t get any help.
They often will not cover medical
services associated with preexisting
conditions. We reiterate: They are junk
plans.
Every American deserves affordable,
high-quality health coverage, which is
why we need to block these junk plans
that provide the opposite.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment.
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Chair, I will
finish by saying that all through this
healthcare debate that we have had
over the last 10 years—and I have been
here 81⁄2 years of that—it has all been
about access to healthcare. This gen-
tlewoman’s amendment, Madam Chair,
limits access to healthcare.
Either they want more access to
healthcare or they don’t. I think if my
colleagues pass this amendment,
Madam Chair, they are limiting access
to healthcare. It is for that reason that
I believe we should defeat the amend-
ment.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam
Chair, I yield back the balance of my
time.

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Chair,
I rise in support of my amendment to
the Labor-Health and Human Services
appropriations package, which strikes
all guidance related to the obligation
of funds for the Affordable Care Act’s
navigator program. By passing this
amendment, we can prevent further
wasteful spending on this failed and
very inefficient program.
For plan year 2017, navigators re-
ceived a total of $62.5 million in grants
and enrolled 81,000 individuals. Each of
these enrollments cost taxpayers $767.
Further, those 81,000 individuals ac-
counted for less than 1 percent of all
the enrollment in ACA plans for that
year.
Arkansas does not use the Federal
marketplace, but I think it is worth
noting that according to CMS, only 2.3
percent of the people in my district
purchased their healthcare on the ex-
change in 2017. Nationwide, less than 4
percent of the population bought Af-
fordable Care Act plans. With a little
bit of math, we come to the conclusion
that we are spending $62.5 million to
enroll less than three-tenths of 1 per-
cent of the population.
The administration wisely decided
that this money could be better spent
elsewhere and cut funding for the pro-
gram to a more reasonable level of $10
million. Yet for some reason, my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle
would like to force the administration
to spend $100 million on this, in my
view, wasteful and ineffective program.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I claim
the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Connecticut is recognized for 5
minutes.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in opposition, and I strongly oppose my
colleague’s amendment that would
strike $100 million from CMS program
management. This is funding that has
been designated to support the Afford-
able Care Act navigator program as
well as outreach, enrollment, and ad-
vertising during the ACA open enroll-
ment period, just further attempts to
sabotage the act.
Because of the Affordable Care Act,
more than 20 million people gained
health insurance, many for the first
time in their lives. The uninsured rate
declined from a high of 18 percent be-
fore the Affordable Care Act to a low of
less than 11 percent. For families, it
meant that insurance companies could
no longer discriminate against people
because of their medical history and
being a woman was no longer a pre-
existing condition.
The ACA was not perfect, but it was
a significant achievement. Unfortu-
nately, the Trump administration has
tried to sabotage the Affordable Care
Act since the day the President took
office. It was not successful, I might
add, at least legislatively not success-
ful. But they have come around to the
appropriations process to continue the
sabotage.
HHS shortened open enrollment, cut
the annual budget for outreach and ad-
vertising by 90 percent, and cut funding
by 80 percent for ACA navigators.
Who are the navigators? They are the
people who provide in-person assist-
ance to a consumer who may need help
in finding a health plan.
We held a hearing in February to
highlight the administration’s efforts
to undermine the Affordable Care Act.
One of our expert witnesses estimated
that HHS’ cuts to outreach, adver-
tising, and enrollment activities re-
sulted in more than 1 million fewer en-
rollments in 2017 and a similar short-
fall in 2018.
The Labor, HHS, Education appro-
priations bill sends a clear message to
the administration: Stop undermining
healthcare for millions of Americans.
Members of Congress have healthcare.
They shouldn’t be undermining other
Americans’ healthcare. Stop allowing
insurance companies to discriminate
again with junk insurance plans. Stop
attacking the mechanisms that we put
in place to hold down costs for Amer-
ican families.
Our bill specifically designates $100
million from ACA user fees to support
ACA navigators as well as outreach,

enrollment, and advertising during the
ACA open enrollment period. These
funds will help millions of American
families navigate the complicated
maze of health insurance to find a
health plan that works for them. It
strengthens the Affordable Care Act in-
dividual market by bringing healthier
individuals into the risk pool, thereby
reducing premiums for everyone.
The gentleman’s amendment seeks to
eliminate those funds, which will make
it harder for Americans to enroll in
high-quality health insurance.
Madam Chair, I strongly oppose the
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Chair,
well, we are all interested in having af-
fordable healthcare, and that is why we
have more market-based healthcare. If
we open up this market and reduce
constraints, then we will get more af-
fordable policies.
I would submit to the Chair tonight
that the reason people don’t accept
these policies is not due to a lack of ad-
vertising, Madam Chair, but due to the
expense, complexity, and
unaffordability of these plans.
In this regard, Madam Chair, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. DAVID P. ROE). My good
friend is the ranking member on the
House Veterans’ Affairs Committee.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Chair, I rise today in support of
my good friend from Arkansas’ amend-
ment.
This bill contains a line item direct-
ing $100 million be spent on the ACA
navigator program. Unless I am mis-
taken, just last month, House Demo-
crats decided it was more important to
play politics than consider legitimate,
bipartisan proposals to address the
constantly increasing healthcare costs.
Madam Chair, in Tennessee, since the
ACA went into effect, our premiums
have gone up in the ACA silo 174 per-
cent. We remember long ago the claim
that the ACA would eliminate con-
stantly increasing healthcare costs and
included $100 million for the navigator
program in that bill.
How many times will we go through
this exercise before my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle realize this
program just doesn’t work?
I have never heard of a government
program in the history of the country
that suddenly started to work without
making any changes by simply throw-
ing $100 million at it. Madam Chair, we
can’t do the same thing over and over
again and expect a different outcome.
In plan year 2017, the navigators re-
ceived $62.5 million and enrolled 81,426
people. With just over 8 million enroll-
ees for 2019, I am not sure how in the
world it makes sense to spend $768 per
enrollee to sign them up. Now House
Democrats want to nearly double that
money for a program that has been
shown to be ineffective in its sole func-
tion, just to enroll people in the ACA.
With ObamaCare enrollment nearly
20 million people below the original
CBO estimate this year—and over 3
million more people gaining private,
employer-sponsored coverage over the
last 2 years because of the strong econ-
omy and job market—we should be
using this money for programs that ac-
tually work.
I support this amendment that elimi-
nates this line-item funding mandate
because I offered a similar amendment
that Democratic leadership decided
was not in order. It would have moved
the money from the navigator program
to the substance abuse treatment fund,
allowing additional grants to treat
those suffering from substance abuse
disorders, which actually would save
lives.
Madam Chair, let’s stop wasting time
and money on programs that don’t
work and support those that do. I ask
my colleagues to support this amend-
ment.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Chair,
I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, let me
just repeat a statistic. Because of the
Affordable Care Act, more than 20 mil-
lion people gained health insurance,
many for the first time in their lives,
and the uninsured rate declined from a
high of 18 percent before the Affordable
Care Act to a low of less than 11 per-
cent.
Now, keep in mind, from the outset
of the Trump administration, the effort
was to repeal and replace the Afford-
able Care Act. I don’t know the ump-
teen times that my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle tried to repeal
the Affordable Care Act.
b 2115
They could never find a way to re-
place it. Ultimately, they failed legis-
latively to repeal and replace the Af-
fordable Care Act.
So, what have they done subse-
quently? They move through the ap-
propriations bills, and they cut back.
They work to do away with the cost-
sharing subsidies for the insurance
companies, which drives the cost up.
They say ‘‘no’’ to the navigators to
help people go through the system and
understand insurance. I will bet every-
one in this institution has somebody
who explains an insurance policy to
them.
So, therefore, I will just finish this
and say: Let’s defeat this amendment
because it is just one more attempt to
sabotage the Affordable Care Act.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Chair,
may I inquire how much time I have
remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Arkansas has 30 seconds remain-
ing.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Chair,
let me simply say that, simply put, at
$768 per enrollee, the navigator pro-
gram is a waste of taxpayer resources.
With ever-shrinking budget pressure,
we are better off spending this money
on NIH research or doing something
that will help long-term health, as my
friend Dr. ROE is interested in: drug
abuse, mental health attention. Those
are the issues that are facing this
country and a better use of this money.
Madam Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on
the amendment, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Chair, I demand
a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Arkansas will be
postponed.

The text of the amendment is as fol-

Page 7, line 5, strike ‘‘only’’.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Arkansas.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Chair,
I would like to return to the topic
today of apprenticeships that are so
important to our workforce across this
country.
My amendment would strip a portion
of the bill that would spend hundreds
of millions of dollars to only support
Department of Labor-registered ap-
prenticeship programs, a stipulation
that has not been in place in previous
bills regarding apprenticeship grant
funding.
So, let me be clear. I support Depart-
ment of Labor-registered apprentice-
ship programs. I am not here to speak
ill of those programs because they do a
good job of equipping workers across
this country with the skills they need
to be successful.
But I am here because I have a prob-
lem with the Congress telling the
American public that the only way to
fill the skills gap and create opportuni-
ties is through government-defined ap-
prenticeship programs.
Right now, our economy is facing an
enormous skilled workforce shortage.
According to the Department of Labor,
there are 7.4 million job vacancies, and,
with our continued economic pros-
perity, that number will only grow.
I speak with businesses in my dis-
trict on a regular basis, in all sectors.
Many would like to expand, create new
jobs; but a consistent message, Madam
Chair, is they are not able to because

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4572 June 12, 2019
they cannot find workers with the nec-
essary skills.
It is an unfortunate fact that the reg-
istered apprenticeship programs come
up short of adequately skilling our en-
tire workforce. For example, in the
construction industry, which uses more
registered apprenticeship programs
than any other industry, only 26,000
people graduated from a registered ap-
prenticeship program in 2018.
Currently, the construction industry
employs nearly 7.5 million people,
which means that less than 1 percent of
the workers in that industry went
through a registered apprenticeship
program.
Economic estimates have the number
of current job openings in construction
at 444,000 in total. So, if we were to rely
only on registered apprenticeship pro-
grams, it would take 17 years to fill
those openings, Madam Chair.
That is why this amendment is so
important: to offer flexibility and to
let other industry-related apprentice-
ship programs also get grant funding.
We are not denying registered ap-
prenticeship grant funding. We are just
simply saying that nonindustry-
registered grant funding should be ef-
fective. They are safe, efficient, and re-
sult in stackable and portable creden-
tials.
Madam Chair, I would like to call on
my friend from Kentucky, ANDY BARR,
a member of the House Financial Serv-
ices Committee, a man who chairs the
Republican Study Committee’s Amer-
ican Worker Task Force, and ask him
for his views.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR).
Mr. BARR. Madam Chair, I thank my
friend, the gentleman from Arkansas,
for his leadership on this very impor-
tant issue, providing employers with
flexibility.
Yes, we want to support Department
of Labor-registered apprenticeships,
but we need employers to be able to fill
these job openings with skilled workers
using apprenticeships that are actually
tailored for the jobs that are available.
When I visit the employers in central
and eastern Kentucky, they all tell me
the same story: Because of tax cuts and
deregulation, the economy is booming,
they are creating jobs, but they can’t
find workers.
There is a labor supply shortage in
this country, and we need more skills.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports
that labor force participation among
prime-age men has dropped from 86 per-
cent in 1950 to a rate currently of 71.5
percent.
We have got to get that labor partici-
pation rate up, and, because of that, we
need skills. That is why I am proud, as
chairman of the Republican Study
Committee’s American Worker Task
Force, to support the Hill amendment,
which would allow Federal grant funds
to be used for apprenticeship programs
that are not just DOL-registered.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman has expired.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Chair,
I yield the gentleman an additional 15
seconds.
Mr. BARR. Madam Chair, not just
DOL-registered programs, but also ap-
prenticeship programs tailored by the
employers for those particular jobs.
So, while the economy does need to
utilize these DOL-registered appren-
ticeship programs, a one-size-fits-all
solution is not the answer. Many em-
ployers need specific, tailored appren-
ticeship programs, and I urge support
for the gentleman’s amendment.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Connecticut is recognized for 5
minutes.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, this
amendment would open up scarce Fed-
eral dollars to untested and unproven,
nonregistered apprenticeship programs.
In fiscal year 2016, the Subcommittee
on Labor, Health and Human Services,
Education, and Related Agencies estab-
lished funding for the Apprenticeship
Grant Program, which has been ex-
panding work-based learning programs
in in-demand industries through reg-
istered apprenticeships, a proven strat-
egy for meeting the needs of our Na-
tion’s workforce and industry, simulta-
neously.
The registered apprenticeship model
has been rapidly expanding over the
past several years. It has grown from 56
percent since 2013—from 375,000 to
585,000—in diverse careers like software
development, nursing assistants, and
insurance agents. According to the De-
partment of Labor, more than 3,000 new
apprenticeship programs were estab-
lished in fiscal year 2018 alone.
To further this important work, the
underlying bill provides an unprece-
dented $250 million investment in reg-
istered apprenticeship programs, a $90
million increase over last year. Yet, in-
stead of supporting and investing in a
tried-and-true program, this amend-
ment would roll back worker protec-
tions and quality assurances, wasting
millions of Federal dollars on an en-
tirely duplicative system called IRAPs,
industry-recognized apprenticeship
programs.
The administration claims critics of
registered apprenticeships lament the
registration process, calling it onerous,
but I have spoken with some of the in-
dustry groups represented on the Presi-
dent’s task force, and, frankly, I hear a
different story. They like the reg-
istered model.
During a panel discussion I held on
apprenticeships, Bridget Gainer, vice
president of Aon, commented on the
ease of registration, saying: ‘‘It was
not an overwhelmingly or overly oner-
ous process.’’
A former staffer at the Department
of Labor and Education, who is now
with New America, wrote an excellent
piece in Inside Higher Ed on the risks
of the Trump administration’s plans to
deregulate apprenticeships.
She said: ‘‘Rather than focus its ef-
forts on growing our small but high-
performing system of registered ap-
prenticeships, the administration has
opted for building an entirely new sys-
tem of industry-recognized apprentice-
ship programs, or IRAPs.’’
These IRAPs have little or no ac-
countability, much like the predatory
for-profit colleges.
The Inside Higher Education piece
makes that point: ‘‘The administration
is copying the system used to ensure
quality in the lowest performing and
most fraud-ridden sector of higher edu-
cation—a system that has repeatedly
failed to protect students and tax-
payers—for its new approach to appren-
ticeship . . . and once Federal dollars
are on the line, the risks—and the scale
of potential harm—increase exponen-
tially.’’
We should be focusing Federal dollars
on expanding the existing system that
is working for employers and for ap-
prentices alike and not on a confusing
duplicate system.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment, and I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Chair,
may I inquire how much time I have
remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Arkansas has 30 seconds remain-
ing.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Chair,
let me say that I appreciate the in-de-
mand job work that the committee has
put in place in the bill. That is wonder-
ful. And I appreciate my friend from
Connecticut’s passion for this topic. I
share it. I support DOL-supported ap-
prenticeships. That has nothing to do
with it.
This simply says that we strike the
word ‘‘only’’ and that, if there is a gap
somewhere in a local economy in this
country, we have the flexibility to have
an industry apprenticeship receive a
grant.
This is supported by the Associated
Builders and Contractors, the general
contractors, the equipment manufac-
turers, the electrical contractors, the
home builders, the roofing contractors,
so this bill has full support.
Madam Chair, I include in the
RECORD their letters.

to be used for apprenticeship programs reg-

ship.

direct pathways to quality middle-class jobs.
While the construction industry is currently
the largest utilizer of apprenticeship trained
workers, the industry continues to experi-
ence a severe worker shortage. The U.S. Bu-
reau of Labor Statistics Job Openings and
Labor Turnover Survey identified 404,000 job
openings in construction at the end of April,
the highest total for any month since the se-
ries began.
To help alleviate these challenges, grow
job opportunities and meet economic de-
mand, AGC believes it is vital to build upon
the past successes construction apprentice-
ship programs have achieved and allow them
every opportunity to recruit and train new
talent into the industry, including access to
valuable federal grants. Ensuring workers
are properly educated and trained is essen-
tial to the future of the construction indus-
try as well as the nation’s infrastructure and
economic growth.
While certain segments of the construction
industry utilize DOL’s registered apprentice-
ship program, not all do. Consequently, all
segments of the construction industry
should ultimately be able to benefit from
any DOL grants programs. Many contractors
have developed their own apprenticeship pro-
grams in the private industry-recognized
market. Industry-led apprenticeships in con-
struction have strict standards of account-
ability and methods to ensure quality, with
penalties for noncompliance. All these pro-
grams should have access to the same federal
grant programs regardless.
AGC supports creating quality jobs and
training the skilled workers to fill them. As
such, federal grants should be available to
all quality programs. Again, AGC reserves
the right to record your vote as a ‘‘key vote’’
for the education of its membership.

DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: The undersigned
organizations write in support of an amend-
ment offered by Rep. French Hill (R–Ark.) to
H.R. 2740—the Labor, Health and Human
Services, Education, Legislative Branch, De-
fense, State, Foreign Operations and Energy
and Water Development Appropriations Act,
2020—which would allow Department of
Labor grants to be used for all forms of ap-
prenticeships. This amendment would open
workforce development and skills education
opportunities for all Americans.
Currently, our nation has a severe skilled
workforce shortage. According to the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are 7.4 mil-
lion job openings in the United States. The
BLS Job Openings and Labor Turnover Sur-
vey identified 404,000 job openings in con-
struction at the end of April, the highest
total for any month since the series began.
To close the skills gap and provide career op-
portunities to the most Americans possible,
Congress should focus on expanding all forms
of apprenticeships, rather than only DOL-
registered programs.
Market-driven or industry-recognized ap-
prenticeships are the most widely used form
of skills education in the construction indus-
try. They have proven to be safe, effective
and successful in providing students with
stackable and portable credentials that are
accepted worldwide.
Many of the below organizations operate
both industry-recognized and DOL-registered
apprenticeship programs. Businesses and as-
sociations provide the most effective career
opportunities when they are able to choose
the best form of skills education for their re-
spective value propositions.
Rep. Hill’s amendment recognizes that
DOL-registered apprenticeship programs pro-
vide career opportunities, but they cannot
fill the skills gap on their own—according to
DOL, only about 26,000 individuals finished a
registered construction apprenticeship pro-
gram in 2018 in an industry that employs 7.4
million people.
We thank Rep. Hill for introducing this
amendment to provide career opportunities
to all Americans and we encourage all mem-
bers of the House of Representatives to sup-
port it.

Ms. LESLEY HILL.
DEAR LESLEY: The equipment manufac-
turing industry is growing and adding thou-
sands of jobs each year, but like many other
industries, there simply aren’t enough indi-
viduals with the right skill-sets available to
fill these jobs. The Association of Equipment
Manufacturers and its members support a
wide variety of training programs and initia-
tives to develop the skill-sets of individuals
so that that they are job ready. This includes
apprenticeship programs. AEM is supportive
of all apprenticeship programs that develop
tomorrow’s workers, and so it makes no
sense to limit the government funding for
these initiatives to only one type of appren-
ticeship program. AEM supports amendment
38, sponsored by Representative French Hill,
which would remove limitations on the type
of apprenticeship programs eligible for grant
money under Title I of H.R. 2740, the appro-
priations vehicle for the Departments of
Labor, Health and Human Services, and Edu-
cation, and Related Agencies for fiscal year
2020. Representative Hill’s amendment is a
common-sense change to the legislation that
will help train a broader group of workers for
careers in family sustaining jobs.
If you have any questions, please do not
hesitate to reach out.

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Chair,
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote to offer flexibility
for contract apprenticeships across this
country, and I yield back the balance
of my time.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, may I
ask how much time I have remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Connecticut has 11⁄2 minutes re-
maining.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, my Re-
publican colleagues talk about the
need for fiscal restraint, government
waste, the problem of duplication. In
fact, many will oppose the underlying
bill, claiming fiscal responsibility, but
now they are offering an amendment
that is the antithesis of fiscal re-
straint.
Let’s be clear. The IRAPs are dupli-
cative. They promote government
waste. This amendment would open up
Federal resources to support a program
that does not exist.
There are no IRAPs. The Department
of Labor has yet to produce any bind-
ing definition of what these programs
are or what they will do. It is easy to
make promises when you do not have
to deliver.
Registered apprenticeship programs
do and currently are delivering. That is
why, in a bipartisan fashion, Congress
has increased funding year after year
in a tested, proven model.
If the gentleman and my Republican
colleagues want to support workforce
development, they can vote in favor of
the underlying bill. It provides $3 bil-
lion to States for job training to
adults, youth, and dislocated workers.
I have a feeling that they will not be-
cause, like the Trump administration’s
proposed IRAPs, they support work-
force development in name only.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment.
We have many supporters of this ef-
fort: North American Building Trade
Unions, United Association of Plumb-
ers and Pipefitters, AFL–CIO, Inter-
national Union of Operating Engineers,

ciation, New America, International
Union of Painters and Allied Trades,

ance of my time.

healing. For far too long, we have made
excuses about a culture that tolerates
violence, discredits survivors, and
looks the other way. Justice has been
delayed.
Today, we are fighting to change
that. We are speaking up. We are
standing up. We are speaking out, de-
manding that we end tolerance of rape
culture.
The CDC’s Rape Prevention and Edu-
cation program has been woefully ig-
nored and underfunded. Our amend-
ment increases critical funding and
puts us one step closer to treating sex-
ual assault as the public health crisis
that it is.
Using a public health frame to tackle
this systemic issue can have a trans-
formative impact on the lives of the
women, men, and nonbinary individ-
uals affected by sexual violence.
Our prevention approaches must be
grounded in data and the lived experi-
ences of our constituents. We must
teach consent, promote understanding,
and reshape the status quo in our
workplaces, our households, and our
schools.
To my survivor tribe, we hear you.
We see you. We are fighting for you.
This one is for you.
I thank the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia for her partnership on this issue,
and I yield such time as she may con-
sume to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Ms. DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of this amendment.
I would note the underlying bill
under consideration tonight includes a
10 percent increase, $5 million for rape
prevention and education activities at
the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
As the increase in our bill highlights,
I am a strong supporter of this pro-
gram. We must stop sexual violence be-
fore it begins. This amendment would
add an additional increase of $5.57 mil-
lion.
I commend my colleagues for bring-
ing further attention to this scourge
that still exists in our society today
and puts women at grave risk. It is an
important program so that we can look
at, address, and prevent sexual vio-
lence.
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’
on this amendment.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Chair, I
yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.
PRESSLEY).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Chair, I demand
a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentlewoman from Massachusetts
will be postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 40 OFFERED BY MR. KHANNA
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 40 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 58, line 10, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(increased by $3,000,000)’’.
Page 62, line 5, after the dollar amount, in-
sert ‘‘(reduced by $3,000,000)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentleman
from California (Mr. KHANNA) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, I have a
bipartisan amendment with the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ).
Today’s amendment adds $3 million
to the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, with the in-
tent to support the Consortium of Food
Allergy Research.
This consortium drives vital research
necessary to fight innumerable condi-
tions and diseases suffered by millions
of Americans. It is foundational to so
many of our medical breakthroughs
and to our competitive advantage.
Key to one of their missions is food
allergies. Food allergies affect 32 mil-
lion Americans and almost 6 million
children. That is nearly 10 percent of
the country battling, at some point,
with food allergies.
Food allergies do not just consist of
sensitivity to certain kinds of food.
That is a myth. Many times, they can
be life-threatening.
In fact, 40 percent of children with
food allergies have experienced a se-
vere reaction, such as anaphylaxis.
Each year, more than 200,000 Ameri-
cans require emergency medical care.
A glance through Facebook pages or
support pages will detail many sad and
scary stories.
This is equivalent to one trip to the
emergency room every 3 minutes, and
the problem continues to grow.
The prevalence of food allergies has
increased by 80 percent in the last two
decades, with peanut and tree nut al-
lergies appearing to have more than
tripled since the 1990s. We really don’t
know yet why that is happening.
In 2005, NIH established CoFAR with-
in NIAID to focus on these efforts. In
just 14 years, CoFAR has made terrific
advances. It discovered genes associ-
ated with an increased risk for peanut
allergy and identified promising cures
for peanut allergy and egg allergy
through immunotherapy.
I salute CoFAR’s extraordinary staff.
CoFAR’s 4-year egg treatment study
actually allowed participants to safely
reintroduce egg, one of the most com-
mon and dangerous allergens for chil-
dren, into their diet after years of ab-
stention.
CoFAR has achieved all of this on a
budget of just $6.1 million. Increasing
it $3 million is well worth the invest-
ment.
Just think of all the families who
could be made better by this. Their
fear of sending their children to school
or to a neighbor’s house or to daycare
without knowing the consequences
could be alleviated.
We are a long way away still, but I
believe we can prevent life-threatening
food allergies someday. This amend-
ment brings us closer to that day.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from California (Ms.
LEE).
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Chair,
I thank the gentleman for yielding.
I rise in strong support of this bipar-
tisan amendment. Recent research has
found that food allergies are far more
common in the United States than pre-
viously thought, and the prevalence
has been increasing in the last two dec-
ades.
Food allergies can cause severe reac-
tions and can even be deadly. Allergic
reactions to food lead to more than
200,000 emergency room visits each
year.
The Consortium of Food Allergy Re-
search at the National Institute of Al-
lergy and Infectious Diseases is sup-
porting research to identify the causes
of and treatments for food allergies.
The proposed funding increase will
allow this critical research to continue
and to accelerate.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment, and I thank the gen-
tleman from California again for offer-
ing it.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Madam
Chair, I claim time in opposition, al-
though I do not oppose the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5
minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Madam
Chair, I rise in support of this amend-
ment, and I am proud to work with my
colleague, Representative KHANNA, in
the effort to increase research funding
for food allergies.
When my colleague asked me to join
his efforts, I could not help but think
of my 1-year-old son and his prob-
ability of developing an allergy later in
life.
The CDC reports the prevalence of
food allergies in children increased by
50 percent between 1997 and 2011. In re-
cent years, we have seen the prevalence
of peanut or tree nut allergies more
than triple in American children.
Food Allergy Research and Edu-
cation, also known as FARE, estimates
5 million children and more than 32
million Americans have food allergies
in the U.S. Furthermore, State by
State data shows that in my State of
Ohio, food allergies and anaphylaxis in-
creased by 169 percent from 2009 to 2016.
Major foods causing anaphylaxis in
Ohio were eggs, peanuts, shellfish, and
tree nuts. About half of the food aller-
gies occurred in kids under 13.
Clearly, we need to do more to find
the scientific causes for this spike in
allergies.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4575
June 12, 2019
Madam Chair, our amendment is a
step in the right direction.
Last year, a local foundation, the Al-
lison Rose Foundation in northeast
Ohio, was launched to educate the pub-
lic about the real risk that food aller-
gies can pose to individuals who suffer
from it. The foundation was estab-
lished in the name of Allison Rose, a
young college student who died as a re-
sult of a reaction due to her peanut al-
lergy.
I urge my colleagues to support this
bipartisan amendment to increase re-
search for food allergies and help us
prevent future tragedies like Allison
Rose.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, I would
like to recognize the gentleman from
Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ) for his leadership,
his willingness in his very first term to
work across the aisle on this, and his
passion for this issue.
I appreciate the leadership of Rep-
resentative DELAURO, as well, and the
staff.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Member opposed each will control 5

The Chair recognizes the gentleman

Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Chair, first,
let me start off by including in the
RECORD a Harvard Public Health jour-
nal article, ‘‘America Is Failing Its
Black Mothers.’’
AMERICA IS FAILING ITS BLACK MOTHERS
For decades, Harvard Chan alumni have
shed light on high maternal mortality rates
in African American women. Finally, policy-
makers are beginning to pay attention.
Serena Williams knew her body well
enough to listen when it told her something
was wrong. Winner of 23 Grand Slam singles
titles, she’d been playing tennis since age 3—
as a professional since 14. Along the way,
she’d survived a life-threatening blood clot
in her lungs, bounced back from knee inju-
ries, and drowned out the voices of sports
commentators and fans who criticized her
body and spewed racist epithets. At 36, Wil-
liams was as powerful as ever. She could still
devastate opponents with the power of a
serve once clocked at 128.6 miles per hour.
But in September 2017, on the day after de-
livering her baby, Olympia, by emergency C-
section, Williams lost her breath and recog-
nized the warning signs of a serious condi-
tion.
She walked out of her hospital room and
approached a nurse, Williams later told
Vogue magazine. Gasping out her words, she
said that she feared another blood clot and
needed a CT scan and an IV of heparin, a
blood thinner. The nurse suggested that Wil-
liams’ pain medication must be making her
confused. Williams insisted that something
was wrong, and a test was ordered—an
ultrasound on her legs to address swelling.
When that turned up nothing, she was finally
sent for the lung CT. It found several blood
clots. And, just as Williams had suggested,
heparin did the trick. She told Vogue, ‘‘I was
like, listen to Dr. Williams!’’
But her ordeal wasn’t over. Severe
coughing had opened her C-section incision,
and a subsequent surgery revealed a hemor-
rhage at that site. When Williams was fi-
nally released from the hospital, she was
confined to her bed for six weeks.
Wanda Irving holds her granddaughter,
Soleil, in front of a portrait of Soleil’s moth-
er, Shalon Irving, at home in Sandy Springs,
Georgia. Wanda has been raising Soleil since
Shalon—an epidemiologist with the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—
died in 2017 from complications of hyper-
tension a few weeks after giving birth.
Like Williams, Shalon Irving, an African
American woman, was 36 when she had her
baby in 2017. An epidemiologist at the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), she wrote in her Twitter bio, ‘‘I see
inequity wherever it exists, call it by name,
and work to eliminate it.’’
Irving knew her pregnancy was risky. She
had a clotting disorder and a history of high
blood pressure, but she also had access to
top-quality care and a strong support system
of family and friends. She was doing so well
after the C-section birth of her baby, Soleil,
that her doctors consented to her request to
leave the hospital after just two nights
(three or four is typical). But after she re-
turned home, things quickly went downhill.
For the next three weeks, Irving made
visit after visit to her primary care pro-
viders, first for a painful hematoma (blood
trapped under layers of healing skin) at her
incision, then for spiking blood pressure,
headaches and blurred vision, swelling legs,
and rapid weight gain. Her mother told
ProPublica that at these appointments, cli-
nicians repeatedly assured Irving that the
symptoms were normal. She just needed to
wait it out. But hours after her last medical
appointment, Irving took a newly prescribed
blood pressure medication, collapsed, and
died soon after at the hospital when her fam-
ily removed her from life support.
Viewed up close, the deaths of mothers like
Irving are devastating, private tragedies.
But pull back, and a picture emerges of a
public health crisis that’s been hiding in
plain sight for the last 30 years.
Following decades of decline, maternal
deaths began to rise in the United States
around 1990—a significant departure from
the world’s other affluent countries. By 2013,
rates had more than doubled. The CDC now
estimates that 700 to 900 new and expectant
mothers die in the U.S. each year, and an ad-
ditional 500,000 women experience life-
threatening postpartum complications. More
than half of these deaths and near deaths are
from preventable causes, and a dispropor-
tionate number of the women suffering are
black.
Put simply, for black women far more than
for white women, giving birth can amount to
a death sentence. African American women
are three to four times more likely to die
during or after delivery than are white
women. According to the World Health Orga-
nization, their odds of surviving childbirth
are comparable to those of women in coun-
tries such as Mexico and Uzbekistan, where
significant proportions of the population live
in poverty.
Irving’s friend Raegan McDonald-Mosley,
chief medical director for Planned Parent-
hood Federation of America, told
ProPublica, ‘‘You can’t educate your way
out of this problem. You can’t health-care-
access your way out of this problem. There’s
something inherently wrong with the system
that’s not valuing the lives of black women
equally to white women.’’
LOST MOTHERS
Speaking at a symposium hosted by the
Maternal Health Task Force at the Harvard
T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Sep-
tember 2018, investigative reporter Nina
Martin noted telling commonalities in the
stories she’s gathered about mothers who
died. Once a baby is born, he or she becomes
the focus of medical attention. Mothers are
monitored less, their concerns are often dis-
missed, and they tend to be sent home with-
out adequate information about potentially
concerning symptoms. For African American
mothers, the risks jump at each stage of the
labor, delivery, and postpartum process.
Neel Shah, an obstetrician-gynecologist at
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Bos-
ton and director of the Delivery Decisions
Initiative at Ariadne Labs, recalls being
struck by Martin’s ProPublica-NPR series
Lost Mothers, which delved into the issue.
‘‘The common thread is that when black
women expressed concern about their symp-
toms, clinicians were more delayed and
seemed to believe them less,’’ he says. ‘‘It’s
forced me to think more deeply about my
own approach. There is a very fine line be-
tween clinical intuition and unconscious
bias.’’
For members of the public, the experiences
of prominent black women may prove to be
a teachable moment. When pop superstar
Beyoncé developed the hypertensive disorder
pre-eclampsia—which left untreated can kill
a mother and her baby—after delivering her
twins by emergency C-section in 2017, Google
searches related to the condition spiked. Ac-
cording to the U.S. Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality, pre-eclampsia—one of
the leading causes of maternal death—and
eclampsia (seizures that develop after pre-ec-
lampsia) are 60 percent more common in Af-
rican American women than in white
women, and also more severe. If it can hap-
pen to Beyoncé—an international star who
presumably can afford the highest-quality
medical care—it can happen to anyone.
WEATHERING REPORT
Arline Geronimus, SD ’85, has been talking
about the effects of racism on health for dec-
ades, even when others haven’t wanted to lis-
ten. Growing up in the 1960s in Brookline,
Massachusetts, Geronimus, who is white, ab-
sorbed the messages of the Civil Rights
movement and the harrowing stories of her
Jewish family’s experiences in czarist Rus-
sia. When she headed off to Princeton as an
undergraduate, she resolved to find a way to
fight against injustice. Her initial plan to be-
come a civil rights lawyer gave way when

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4576 June 12, 2019
she discovered the power and potential of
public health research.
Geronimus worked as a research assistant
for a professor studying teen pregnancy
among poor urban residents, and, as a volun-
teer at a Planned Parenthood clinic, wit-
nessed close-up the lives of pregnant black
teens living in poverty in Trenton, New Jer-
sey. She felt a chasm open up between what
some of her white male professors were con-
fidently explicating about the lives of these
adolescents and how the young women them-
selves saw their lives.
According to the conventional wisdom at
the time, Geronimus says, teen pregnancy
was the primary driver of maternal and in-
fant deaths and a host of multigenerational
health and social problems among low-in-
come African Americans. Researchers fo-
cused on this issue while ignoring broader
systemic factors.
Geronimus sought to connect the dots be-
tween the health problems the girls experi-
enced, like asthma and type 2 diabetes, and
negative forces in their lives. She visited
them in their crumbling apartments and ac-
companied them to medical appointments
where doctors treated the girls like props,
without agency in their own care. And she
noticed that they seemed older, somehow,
than girls the same age whom Geronimus
knew.
‘‘That’s when I got the fire in my belly,’’
she says, her voice rising. ‘‘These young
women had real, immediate needs that those
of us in the hallowed halls of Princeton could
have helped address. But we weren’t seeing
those urgent needs. We just wanted to teach
them about contraception.’’
Geronimus came to the Harvard Chan
School to learn how to rigorously explore
the ways that social disadvantage corrodes
health—a concept for which she coined the
term ‘‘weathering.’’ Her adviser, Steven
Gortrnaker, professor of the practice of
health sociology, provided data for her to
correlate infant mortality by maternal age.
While most such studies put mothers into
broad categories of teen and not-teen,
Geronimus looked at the risks they faced at
every age. The results were surprising even
to her.
White women in their 20s were more likely
to give birth to a healthy baby than those in
their teens. But among black women, the op-
posite was true: The older the mother, the
greater the risk of maternal and newborn
health complications and death. In public
health, the condition of a baby is considered
a reliable proxy for the health of the mother.
Geronimus’ data suggested that black
women may be less healthy at 25 than at 17.
‘‘Being able to see those stark numbers
was essential for me,’’ says Geronimus, who
is now a professor of health behavior and
health education at the University of Michi-
gan School of Public Health and a member of
the National Academy of Medicine. And the
implications were staggering. If young black
women were already showing signs of weath-
ering, how would that play out over the rest
of their lives—and what could be done to
stop it?
Geronimus’ questions were ahead of their
time. The press and the public—even other
scientists—misinterpreted her findings as a
recommendation that black women have
children in their teens, she says, recalling
with a sigh such clueless headlines as, ‘‘Re-
searcher says let them have babies.’’
In the 1970s, even researchers who broached
the topic of racial differences in health out-
comes—and few did—focused on small pieces
of the puzzle. Some were looking at genetics,
others at behavioral and cultural differences
or health care access. ‘‘No one wanted to
look at what was wrong with how our society
works and how that can be expressed in the
health of different groups,’’ Geronimus says.
Over time, her ideas would become harder to
dismiss.
The tide began to turn in the early 1980s,
when former Health and Human Services
Secretary Margaret Heckler convened the
first group of experts to conduct a com-
prehensive study of the health status of mi-
nority populations. As the field of social epi-
demiology took off, the Report of the Sec-
retary’s Task Force on Black and Minority
Health (also known as the Heckler Report)
brought Geronimus’ animating questions
into mainstream debate.
Then, in 1993, researchers identified a phys-
iological mechanism that could finally ex-
plain weathering: allostatic load. ‘‘We as a
species are designed to respond to threats to
life by having a physiological stress re-
sponse,’’ Geronimus explains. ‘‘When you
face a literal life-or-death threat, there is a
short window of time during which you must
escape or be killed by the predator.’’ Stress
hormones cascade through the body, sending
blood flowing to the muscles and the heart
to help the body run faster and fight harder.
Molecules called pro-inflammatory
cytokines are produced to help heal any
wounds that result.
These processes siphon energy from other
bodily systems that aren’t enlisted in the
fight-or-flight response, including those that
support healthy pregnancies. That’s not im-
portant if the threat is short term, because
the body’s biochemical homeostasis quickly
returns to normal. But for people who face
chronic threats and hardships—like strug-
gling to make ends meet on a minimum wage
job or witnessing racialized police bru-
tality—the fight-or-flight response may
never abate. ‘‘It’s like facing tigers coming
from several directions every day,’’
Geronimus says, and the damage is com-
pounded over time.
As a result, health risks rise at increas-
ingly younger ages for chronic conditions
like hypertension and type 2 diabetes. De-
pression and sleep deprivation become more
common. People are also more likely to en-
gage in risky coping behaviors, such as over-
eating, drinking, and smoking.
Geronimus’ foundational work in the 1980s
and 1990s has been cited by David R. Wil-
liams, the Florence Sprague Norman and
Laura Smart Norman Professor of Public
Health at the Harvard Chan School, an inter-
nationally recognized expert in the ways
that racism and other social influences af-
fect health. His Everyday Discrimination
Scale is one of the most widely used meas-
ures of discrimination in health studies. It
includes questions that measure experiences
such as being treated with discourtesy, re-
ceiving poorer service than others in res-
taurants or stores, or witnessing people act
as if they’re afraid of you. As he explained in
a 2016 TED MED talk, ‘‘This scale captures
ways in which the dignity and the respect of
people who society does not value is chipped
away on a daily basis.’’
MATERNAL MORTALITY IN THE U.S.: A HUMAN
RIGHTS CRISIS
Despite high-tech medical advances of the
last century, women around the world are
still dying in pregnancy and childbirth from
age-old scourges such as hemorrhage and
pre-eclampsia and, increasingly, from com-
plications related to chronic diseases, obe-
sity, and advanced maternal age.
In 2000, the global health and development
community acknowledged the need for ac-
tion in Goal 5 of the U.N. Millennium Devel-
opment Goals, which aimed to reduce mater-
nal deaths by three-quarters in 15 years (it
declined by 45 percent). While press and pub-
licity around the push offered harrowing sto-
ries, women reading these stories in the U.S.
may well have come away believing that it
was a problem for mothers in villages in Si-
erra Leone—but surely not in Atlanta or
Washington, D.C.
Starting in 2008, human rights groups
around the world began calling on the U.S.
to do more to keep its mothers from dying.
The United Nations Committee on the Elimi-
nation of Racial Discrimination (CERD) ex-
pressed concern about inequities in maternal
mortality and recommended that steps be
taken to improve access to maternal health
care, family planning, and sexuality edu-
cation and information.
A 2012 Amnesty International report de-
clared that these steps weren’t enough: ‘‘Pre-
ventable maternal mortality can result from
or reflect violations of a variety of human
rights, including the right to life, the right
to freedom from discrimination, and the
right to the highest attainable standard of
health.’’ Having ratified two key inter-
national treaties guaranteeing these rights,
the authors wrote, the U.S. government
should be held accountable.
Four years later, representatives from the
advocacy organization SisterSong, the Cen-
ter for Reproductive Rights, and National
Latina Institute for Reproductive Health
issued a report to CERD further exploring
these issues. CERD adopted the groups’ rec-
ommendations, including addressing stereo-
types that promote discrimination in clin-
ical settings and standardizing data collec-
tion on maternal deaths. In 2015, an advo-
cacy organization called Black Mamas Mat-
ter emerged out of this effort to keep push-
ing the agenda forward.
To the women leading the charge, one cen-
tral fact was clear: Racism is an undeniable
thread running through the stories of black
mothers who die. But as Elizabeth Dawes
Gay, co-director of Black Mamas Matter and
a public health professional, wrote in The
Nation, providers and researchers often place
‘‘the onus for large-scale change on individ-
uals rather than the systems that we know
cause harm.’’
Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Chair, I rise
today with an amendment to increase
funding for the State Maternal Health
Innovation Program by $7 million. This
program is specifically tasked with re-
ducing care gaps, maternal mortality,
and disparities in maternal health.
The United States is the greatest
country in the world with the most in-
novative healthcare system around. We
continue to develop cutting-edge treat-
ments that stretch the bounds of what
is possible. Within the last two dec-
ades, we have mapped the human ge-
nome, conducted surgeries over the
Internet, and grown organs out of stem
cells. We have cured diseases and revo-
lutionized treatments.
Despite all that progress, more of our
mothers and mothers-to-be are dying
today than at the turn of the century.
Somehow, we have seen our maternal
mortality rate increase over the past 25
years, and preventable near-deaths re-
lated to pregnancy have increased over
200 percent.
The statistics are shocking, and the
reality for Black mothers is a crisis.
Black mothers in Louisiana are now 4
times more likely to die than White
mothers. The rate of Black maternal
deaths is closer to the rates in devel-
oping countries than the nations we
usually compare ourselves to.
With our vast resources and advanced

our immediate attention. That is why I
am here today with this amendment.
With this increased funding, more
States can implement programs to im-
prove the care that mothers receive.
More families can remain whole. More
children can grow up with their moth-
ers.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from California (Ms.
LEE).
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Chair,
first, let me thank the gentleman for
yielding and for this amendment.
I rise in strong support of this
amendment. More women die from
pregnancy-related complications in the
United States than any other devel-
oped country.
There are major disparities. For ex-
ample, Black women are 3 to 4 times
more likely than White women to die
during pregnancy or childbirth.
I was proud to support a new initia-
tive to address maternal mortality in
the fiscal year 2019 appropriations act.
This amendment will enable the bureau
to expand support for State Maternal
Health Innovation Grants, which fund
evidence-based, State-led demonstra-
tions to improve maternal care service
delivery and, ultimately, reduce mater-
nal mortality.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment, and I thank the gen-
tleman for offering this tonight.
b 2145
Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker, if
there are no other speakers, I am pre-
pared to close.
Madam Speaker, let me just say, sim-
ply put, for Black women far more
than for White women, giving birth can
amount to a death sentence.
When Black women express concern
about their symptoms, clinicians are
more delayed and seem less likely to
believe them. And the question be-
comes, as Harvard put it, whether it is
clinical intuition versus unconscious
bias.
So as we look around the country and
we see the complications from mother-
hood for African American women, we
can look at Serena Williams; we can
look at Beyonce; we can look in my
household; we can look at Ashley
Mitchell, whose funeral I went to just
this past weekend.
This is a crisis we have the ability
overcome. We are America. We do
great things when we put our mind to
it, and this amendment simply asks
this body to put our mind to maternal
health, especially for African American
women, but for all women in this coun-
try, to make sure that the best thing
about womanhood, an ability to give
birth, does not become a death sen-
tence.
Madam Chair, I ask for everyone’s
support, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Louisiana (Mr. RICH-
MOND).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Chair, I demand
a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Louisiana will be
postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 42 OFFERED BY MR. BANKS
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 42 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Mr. BANKS. Madam Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division A (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. Each amount made available by
this division (other than an amount required
to be made available by a provision of law) is
hereby reduced by 14 percent.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentleman
from Indiana (Mr. BANKS) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Indiana.
Mr. BANKS. Madam Chair, I yield
myself as much time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Chair, under this division, we
are looking at spending $189.9 billion
for fiscal year 2020. That is an increase
of $11.8 billion over the 2019-enacted
levels and $47.9 billion above the Presi-
dent’s request.
With $22 trillion in debt and trillion-
dollar deficits for as far as the eye can
see, it is long past time for Congress to
start making the difficult decisions
necessary to balance the budget.
If we do not confront this problem,
we will condemn future generations to
higher taxes and a lower standard of
living.
As a father of three daughters, this is
simply unacceptable to me.
Madam Chair, my amendment re-
duces the funds made available for
each amount in division A of H.R. 2740
by 14 percent. This would reduce total
appropriations of this division down to
Budget Control Act levels.
As chairman of the Republican Study
Committee Task Force on Budget and
Spending, I am proud to have worked
with eight of my colleagues on the only
serious effort in this Congress to con-
front our debt crisis.
The result was a budget that cut $12.6
trillion in spending and balanced in 6
years.
An important part of the RSC budget
was bringing nondefense discretionary
spending down to commonsense levels.
My amendment before the House today
would help make those reductions a re-
ality.
Adoption of this amendment would
show that we are acknowledging our
spending addiction and are taking the
necessary first steps to address it.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this commonsense amend-
ment and rein in spending of taxpayer
dollars.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Chair,
I rise in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
is recognized for 5 minutes.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Chair,
this amendment would cut funding for
important programs and services that
provide opportunities for working fam-
ilies. Many of these programs are al-
ready underfunded and fail to meet the
existing need.
For instance, the amendment would
cut Head Start by more than $1.6 bil-
lion, denying slots to 80,000 children we
are trying to provide with access to
high quality, early learning programs,
as well as rejecting our proposal to in-
crease funding for trauma-informed
care, which is critical for children af-
fected by the opioid crisis.
This amendment would cut after-
school programs by $185 million, taking
away enrichment opportunities for
roughly 222,000 students.
It would cut Title I funding by $2.4
billion, reducing resources for an esti-
mated 25 million students in high-pov-
erty schools.
It would cut the number of new and
competing research grants at NIH by
approximately 87 percent, which is over
10,000 fewer new research grants.
It cuts tens of millions of nutritious
meals for more than 2 million low-in-
come seniors.
Also, this amendment would close
Social Security field offices in every
district, while worsening wait times for
in-person services, phone services, and
exacerbating the disability hearings
backlog.
It would also cut Federal Work Study
programs by $200 million, resulting in
114,000 fewer awards to students.
The sponsor of the amendment cites
the national debt as a reason to cut
funding to programs that benefit work-
ing families, but I note that he did vote
for the Republican tax scam, which
added more than $2 trillion to the na-
tional debt by cutting taxes for big cor-
porations and the wealthiest families.
My Republican colleagues don’t ob-
ject to adding to the debt when it bene-
fits corporations and the wealthy.
They only object to it if it means pro-
viding opportunities for hardworking
families.
Madam Chair, I strongly oppose this
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BANKS. Madam Chair, the Dem-
ocrat majority promised the American
people before the last election that
they would produce a budget, and the
Democrat majority has failed the very
basic first step of leadership in failing
to do so.
Without putting a budget on the
floor of this House of Representatives
and showing the American people the
priorities of the Democrat majority, we

H4578 June 12, 2019
can only assume that the Democrat
majority has no interest in balancing
the budget.
That being the case, my amendment
is a very basic first step toward doing
just that.
My daughters are 9, 7, and 6 years
old, and they are the ones who will be
holding the bag for the lack of leader-
ship in this Congress, who refuses to
address the issue that is staring us in
the face, a $22 trillion national debt.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Chair,
this amendment would cut $25.6 billion
from programs that fund schools, Pell
Grants, community health centers,
substance abuse prevention and treat-
ment, biomedical research, the CDC,
childcare, and early childhood learning
programs, also job training, as well as
agencies that protect workers and
workplaces, among so many other pro-
grams that provide opportunities to
low and middle-income families.
The amendment is totally misguided,
and it will harm tens of millions of
Americans.
Madam Chair, I strongly oppose it. I
urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. BANKS. Madam Chair, Hoosiers
sent me to Washington, D.C., to do
something about just this.
The spend, spend, spend mantra of
Members of Congress for many decades
in the past has got to come to an end
now.
That is why this amendment, a com-
monsense amendment to cut spending
in this appropriations package by 14
percent, is a necessary step forward to
balancing the budget.
That is why I am here. I am com-
mitted to being tireless in my pursuit
of a balanced budget.
Madam Chair, as I have said already,
we have a $22 trillion national debt.
This division spends $189.9 billion,
which is an increase of $11.8 billion
over the 2019-enacted levels and $47.9
billion more than the President’s re-
quest.
If Congress does not confront this
problem head on and exercise fiscal dis-
cipline, we are robbing our children’s
children of their future.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

a Member opposed each will control 5

The Chair recognizes the gentleman

Mr. KEATING. Madam Chair, with
every study, every research paper,
every scientific breakthrough, we have
come to understand that most Ameri-
cans realize that there is more to
healthcare than those who are sick and
those who aren’t. Really, we can’t just
focus our treatment on those that are
unwell.
It is a shortsighted strategy, and un-
fortunately, the one this country has
been employing for far too long before
the Affordable Care Act.
Why would we only try to treat the
problem once it has already occurred,
when we can work to prevent it in the
first place?
The keys to prevention are a healthy
living environment and swift access to
care, helping us deal with healthcare
issues before they become acute. And
this approach will save money.
With that in mind, I am offering my
amendment to appropriate funds to
study how to help bring social and be-
havioral aid programs under the same
roof as our traditional healthcare pro-
viders.
We know there is a link between
healthy living, housing, and food secu-
rity. If we already allocate funds to
programs to help facilitate healthy liv-
ing, why don’t we house them in the
same place that we are housing these
health centers?
This works. I have seen it.
A holistic approach like this will
demonstrate to people in rural, under-
served, or underprivileged communities
that no matter how seemingly dire
their situations, there are paths to
healthy living.
Sadly, we see daily reminders that
where someone is born or where they
live can determine so much in their
lives.
My home State of Massachusetts is a
leader when it comes to healthcare, but
it is not without its own disparities. In
some corners of my district, the aver-
age life expectancy is less than 70 years
of age, while elsewhere in the Common-
wealth, it could be over 90 years old.
There is no easy answer to why that
is the case. It is a combination of
means, education, environment, and
access to healthcare.
Clearly, there needs to be more
progress. Education and access to in-
formation can help to lift people into
healthier circumstances.
If health centers had specialists who
had experience dealing with SNAP and
WIC, more families would receive nu-
tritional advice and more young moth-
ers would be able to raise healthier ba-
bies.
In those same centers, if we had peo-
ple who could really help with housing
concerns, we would be able to get more
people into stable situations and off
the street corners and away from
homelessness.
For those dealing with brain diseases
like addiction, integrating mental
health services could help improve ac-
cess to comprehensive treatment.
In my district, I have seen firsthand
the great work done by the Greater
New Bedford Community Health Center
and the Outer Cape Health Services in
Harwich, Massachusetts, where they
try to incorporate these services, and
actually successfully incorporate these
services that impact social detriments
of healthcare all under one roof.
I am also excited to note that this
coming Friday, the Outer Cape Health
Services is reopening and expanding a
comprehensive healthcare center in
Wellfleet to better serve an under-
served rural community over 90 min-
utes away from the closest hospital.
But nationwide, existing resources
can only get us so far.
We are on the verge of a break-
through, and we need to find out how
Congress can take us beyond this tip-
ping point.
That is why my amendment is impor-
tant. We need to know how much our
health centers need to plan and what
they need to successfully tackle social
determinates of health alongside tradi-
tional healthcare services.
My amendment provides the Health
Resources & Services Administration
with the resources that will allow them
to study this.
Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from California (Ms.
LEE).

Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chair,
first let me thank the gentleman from
Massachusetts for offering this ex-
tremely important amendment, and I
fully support it.
Social factors such as poverty, sub-
standard housing, and unsafe neighbor-
hoods are critical drivers of health out-
comes. I share the gentleman’s concern
and agree that we need to better under-
stand how environmental conditions
such as these play a role in human
health.
Let me just say to the gentleman, we
work very closely with the Black, His-
panic, and Asian Pacific American
Caucus in terms of our health strate-
gies with regard to communities of
color to close health disparities. This
amendment is so important in those ef-
forts.
I would note, also, that the com-
mittee report accompanying the Labor-
HHS appropriations bill encourages the

Services to clarify and disseminate

Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today to offer my amendment to H.R.
2740. My amendment would increase
the funding for neonatal abstinence
syndrome research by $2 million at the
Centers for Disease Control to ensure
adequate funding for this terrible con-
dition.
The opioid epidemic plaguing our Na-
tion is heartbreaking, and especially in
my home State of West Virginia. Too
many members of our communities
know of its devastating effects far too
well. Whether it be a family member, a
friend, the person in line behind you at
the grocery store, or even someone
praying beside you in church, we all
have seen the pain that it causes.
Sadly, many of our youngest citizens
are suffering from the second-genera-
tion impacts of this crisis as well. West
Virginia has one of the highest rates of
neonatal abstinence syndrome, which
is the withdrawal symptoms experi-
enced by infants who are exposed to
opioids and other addictive drugs while
inside the womb. For every 1,000 babies
born in my State, 50 enter this world
exposed to drugs.
In my hometown of Huntington, we
are blessed to have facilities that are
dedicated to caring for babies suffering
from NAS, like the neonatal thera-
peutic unit at the Hoops Family Chil-
dren’s Hospital and Lily’s Place, where
First Lady Melania Trump made a very
special visit last year.
I visited the hospital to see these
beautiful, innocent babies who are bat-
tling insurmountable odds. My heart
aches as they cry in pain, shivering and
shaking. I see the care in the eyes of
the doctors and the nurses who tend to
them 24 hours a day, and I can feel the
love from the volunteers who cuddle
these tiny children and soothe them
through the worst moments of their
early lives.
There is still so much more to do. My
colleagues, I stand before you to tell
you that, today, we can do more. I ask
you all to support my amendment to
double the funding of NAS research and
to improve the lives of our most pre-
cious and struggling citizens.
This is so very important to our lit-
tle tiny babies who are exposed to the
terrible epidemic that we have going
on across our country, and I urge Mem-
bers, please adopt my amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Rhode Island.
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chairman, a recent study found
that only about 36 percent of Ameri-
cans would be able to pass a multiple
choice test with questions from the
U.S. citizenship test on it, while an-
other study found that only 26 percent
of Americans are able to name all three
branches of government.
These numbers are not only startling
on their own, but they also correspond
with historically low opinions of the
Federal Government and record low
voter turnout rates. Currently, only
nine States in this country require stu-
dents to complete 1 year of education
in civics or government, while 10
States have no civics education re-
quirement at all.
Across the country, school districts
are expressing concern over the need
for greater civics education. Last year,
74 percent of superintendents expressed
that preparing students to become en-
gaged citizens was a challenge.
In African American and Hispanic
communities, students are twice as
likely to score low on national civics
assessment tests as White students.
And a similar gap exists between
wealthy and poor communities as well.
These are all signs that point to a
growing crisis in civic and political en-
gagement in younger Americans, and
unless action is taken against students
engaged in their government, dis-
enchantment with the electoral process
and disinterest in the issues that will
increasingly shape their future and the
future of our Nation will continue to
grow.
Congress needs to show a commit-
ment to strengthening civics education
programs throughout our country in
order to reverse the trend. My amend-
ment would provide an additional
$500,000 for national activities in civics
and history education under title 2 of
the Elementary and Secondary Edu-
cation Act.
Evidence demonstrates that effective
civics education can have a significant
impact on young people. Students who
receive effective civics education de-
velop strong critical thinking skills,
are more likely to take an active role
in their government, and are much
more likely to volunteer or become
more involved in their communities.
According to the Center for Informa-
tion and Research on Civic Learning
and Engagement, students who partici-
pate in civics education during high
school are significantly more likely to
graduate from college.
I am hopeful that this modest in-
crease will show that we are ready to
move in the direction of preparing
young people in this country to be
more engaged with the world around
them and ensure that they are invested
in strengthening our democracy.
I urge my colleagues to adopt the
amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of
my time to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. LEE).
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chairman,
first let me thank my colleague for
raising the importance of the American
history and civics national activities
program, and I support this amend-
ment.
These competitive grants reflect one
of two dedicated funding streams for

Labor-HHS bill helping to spur innova-
tion and assist underserved students.

Mr. BERA. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today to offer an amendment to H.R.
2740.
My amendment is simple. It would
direct the Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration,
SAMHSA, to explore using its funds to
explore peer-to-peer mental health pro-
grams for first responders.
Our first responders—our police offi-
cers, our EMS, our firefighters—are at
particular risk for suicide. Studies
have found they have some of the high-
est rates of suicide. This is a difficult
thing to discuss, but we need to address
it.
These are men and women who are
exposed to trauma every day, things
that a normal human being is not
going to see. Every day, firefighters,
police officers, and EMS are responding
to calls for help. It is time we heard
their call. That is why I am glad the
Labor-HHS appropriations report re-
quires SAMHSA to examine PTSD
among first responders.
I want to thank my colleagues, Mrs.
MURPHY and Mr. SOTO, for working to
include this language in the bill.
One tool to address post-traumatic
stress is peer-to-peer programs where
our first responders can turn to a trust-
ed friend and talk to them about what
they are struggling with.
I have introduced the Helping Emer-
gency Responders Overcome, or HERO,
Act to authorize HHS to do just that.
We need to explore this tool so that we
can help our police, our EMS, our fire-
fighters just as they help us.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to support my amendment.
I yield the balance of my time to my
colleague from California (Ms. LEE).
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chairman,
first of all, let me thank the gentleman
for this very important amendment,
and I rise in strong support of it.
Civilian first responders in the dis-
ciplines of law enforcement, fire serv-
ices, and emergency medical services
routinely face highly stressful situa-
tions. They are the ones we call upon
when we are in need. This amendment
raises attention to the importance of
the mental health needs of our first re-
sponders.
Peer-to-peer mental health programs
for our first responders acknowledge
that those who are committed to the
same type of work may be the ones
best suited to support their own col-
leagues’ mental health.
For so long mental health issues
were relegated to the shadows, ap-
proached with the shame and mis-
understanding that only exacerbates
pain for people and their families.
Now, as a clinical social worker my-
self by profession and the chair of the
Social Work Caucus here in the House,
we know how widespread these issues
are. It is up to all of us to work to
erase the stigma around mental health.
I thank my colleague for offering this
amendment, and I urge its adoption.
Mr. BERA. Mr. Chairman, I yield
back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. BERA).
The question was taken; and the Act-

Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr.
Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from California will be
postponed.

AMENDMENT NO. 47 OFFERED BY MR. CASTRO OF
TEXAS
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 47 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Chairman,
I have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 113, line 23, after ‘‘section 5.5,’’ insert
‘‘and section 3.3.16’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. CASTRO) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Texas.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Chairman,
this amendment requires the Office of
Refugee Resettlement to report all
deaths of children in their custody.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Chairman, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Chairman,
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentleman for his commit-
ment, his concern, and his dedication.
I rise in support of my colleague’s
amendment.
The death of any child is devastating.
The fact that children have died while
in the custody of the Federal Govern-
ment and we don’t know the cir-
cumstances of why, or sometimes even
when, they have died is almost beyond
comprehension to me.
We have an oversight role. It is our
responsibility to make sure that chil-
dren are safe and protected while they
are in the custody of Health and
Human Services. If you take a look at
the mission statement of Health and
Human Services, it says to place a
child in a safe environment and do it as
expeditiously as possible.
It is also our responsibility to ensure
that HHS is fully transparent and they
‘‘appropriately respond to the death of
an unaccompanied alien child in the
care and custody of ORR.’’
What my colleague, Mr. CASTRO,
wants to do is to make sure that the
Department of Health and Human
Services follows its own written policy.
It is as simple as that. HHS’ own pol-
icy, section 3.3.16 states: ‘‘ORR and its
care providers must immediately re-
port the death to appropriate Federal,
State, and local authorities. ORR must
also notify the child or youth’s parent,
legal guardian, or next-of-kin; attor-
ney; and applicable consulate of the
death.’’
My God, if we can’t do that, who are
we? Where are our values? Shame on us
if we are not protecting these children
and reporting when something is wrong
or when they have died.
Mr. Chairman, this is a commonsense
amendment. I strongly support it. I
thank the gentleman for offering it.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Chairman,
I want to repeat what my amendment
is. My amendment is to make sure that
if a child dies in government custody,
that that death is reported to the Con-
gress. I am shocked that anybody in
this Chamber would disagree with that
provision.
I am saying that if somebody dies in
ORR custody, they are going to tell us.
So to be opposed to this amendment
means that you want to be part of a
coverup and make sure that the gov-
ernment does not say anything about a
child’s death.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4581
June 12, 2019
The reason that this is so important
is because last September a young 10-
year-old girl died. This Congress and
the American people were not told for
7 or 8 months about that young girl’s
death.
Today, we offer an amendment to
make sure that the Congress is told,
that the American people know what is
going on with their government. And
when I offer that amendment on the
other side, I am opposed, people are
against it. They want to cover up these
deaths? They don’t want the American
people to know that people are dying?
There have been, in the last few
years—actually, in less than a year—
six children who have died in govern-
ment custody, and more adults over
the last few years.
This is already the rule with the De-
partment of Homeland Security with
ICE. This is extending it to ORR.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Chairman, it is al-
ready the rule. We are wasting our
time here today. These are reported.
The hypocrisy of coming to the floor
and claiming to be for the children,
while opposing the President’s supple-
mental budget that actually will take
care of these children.
The Members who are going to vote
and who support this opposed the
President’s funding request to actually
take care of the thousands of children
who are crossing the border every
week. Without that money, you can’t
take care of these children.
So the proponents of this amend-
ment—again, this is a totally unneces-
sary amendment because this is al-
ready the policy of the administration.
This is make-believe. This administra-
tion reports the deaths. It is the hypo-
critical proponents of the amendment
who oppose funding to take care of
children on the border for purely polit-
ical purposes.
If they really want to take care of
the children on the border, this bill
would have included a supplemental
appropriation to take care of those
children. In fact, that amendment was
considered in committee and along
party lines rejected. The majority re-
jected money to take care of the chil-
dren and now come to the floor and
claim to be for the children.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.
MEADOWS).
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentleman for his passion,
for his advocacy, and for truly making
sure that we set the record straight.
The gentleman from Texas has his
heart in the right place. Actually, the
gentlewoman who spoke earlier, she
and I actually met the very first time,
we came together—a liberal from the
northeast, a conservative from the
south—to actually address human traf-
ficking together.
I think it is high time that in a bi-
partisan way we get together, work to-
gether on this supplemental, and let’s
do it tonight. Instead of having show
votes, let’s make sure that we provide
the money that the President has re-
quested to make sure that the humani-
tarian needs at the border are taken
care of.
The gentleman from Maryland is ex-
actly right, now is the time to act.
Let’s show the compassion with our
vote.
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. ROY).
Mr. ROY. Mr. Chairman, we are sit-
ting here 10:30 at night, and I am mys-
tified that my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle are preaching about
this issue, which is already the policy
of the administration, and yet we are
not funding the $4.5 billion request
from the administration to deal with
the problem at hand.
Our border is being overrun. My
friend from Texas knows this, we know
it, if you go spend any time on the bor-
der. We had 144,000 people apprehended
on our southern border. HHS has taken
charge of nearly 41,000 unaccompanied
alien children this year, a 57 percent
increase from last year. I could go
down stat after stat after stat.
Little girls are being abused on the
journey and cartels are profiting while
we ignore it. Talk to the mayor of
Uvalde, Texas, and throughout the
southern area of Texas, talk to the peo-
ple about what is actually happening in
the communities.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman has expired.
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Texas.
Mr. ROY. I cannot believe, for the
life of me, that we can’t come together
in a bipartisan fashion to pass $4.5 bil-
lion to fund the necessary beds, to fund
what is necessary to house these chil-
dren.
When people talk about kids in cages,
are they directly attacking Border Pa-
trol? Have they spent time with Border
Patrol who are trying to figure out
whether a kid’s dad is actually the dad
or whether it is somebody who is using
that child?
That is happening today while this
body waxes on about whatever amend-
ment we are throwing on the floor
right now that is already part of the
administrative policy. We are not actu-
ally addressing the problem. And the
American people sent us here to do
that: Oh, by the way, oh, no, we are de-
manding votes.
Heaven forbid this body votes. Heav-
en forbid we follow the Constitution,
which says something about a quorum.
Maybe we should actually be in this
body voting on the things the Amer-
ican people sent us here to do, like se-
cure the border and ensure the safe
passage of migrants in the United
States of America under our rule of
law.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Chairman,
we have a disagreement. I don’t believe
this is the law right now. If it already
is the law, then what is the big deal
with supporting this amendment? All
it does is reaffirm the law. I am sur-
prised that we can’t agree to it.
I want to give you an example and a
story of why this is so important. Last
September, when Darlyn Valle died in
the custody of the Office of Refugee Re-
settlement, news of this death was not
revealed to the American public or
Members of Congress until just a few
weeks ago because of a CBS investiga-
tion.
Darlyn Valle was 10 years old when
she died while in ORR custody. She was
in ORR custody in my hometown of
San Antonio when she became gravely
ill and staff sent her to the hospital.
However, beyond those few details, we
have limited information surrounding
her death because the administration
has decided to deny it to Congress,
even after we asked the officials re-
peatedly about any injuries, abuse, or
deaths on their watch.
This amendment seeks to end this
confusion and enhance transparency in
our government. I want to repeat that
again. Last fall, when we were asking
this administration whether any child
had died or been seriously injured in
government care and custody, their an-
swer was no.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Chairman, the bot-
tom line is, let’s stop the charades.
This is already an administration pol-
icy.
I understand the desire to score polit-
ical points against this President, a
president who has come to Congress
and said that we need more money be-
cause of the flood of children across the
border. There were 145,000 people who
crossed the border last month, includ-
ing thousands and thousands of chil-
dren—he needs money to take care of
them—and the majority refuses to
bring this bill to the floor. In fact, in a
motion to recommit, they voted
against it and in committee they voted
against it.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. CASTRO).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.

PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Revive us, O Lord, for Your Name’s
sake. Fill our Senators with Your Spir-
it and lead them to Your desired des-
tination. Keep them so dedicated to
Your purposes that they will do justly,
love mercy, and walk humbly. Equip
them to bear the responsibility they
cannot assign to others but must carry
in the strength You provide. Give them
the wisdom to be quick to listen and
slow to speak as You incline their
hearts to live with integrity.
Lord, may faith replace fear, truth
arise over falsehood, love prevail over
hate, and peace abide with us all.
We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.

RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak for 1

f
MULTIEMPLOYER PENSIONS
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Con-
gress needs to address the crisis facing
multiemployer pension plans. The Fi-
nance Committee is continuing its
work on retirement income security,
including those issues with the multi-
employer plans.
While we work to enact the first
round of reforms in the retirement sav-
ings accounts, known as RESA, which
is now before the Senate, there is still
more work to do. We have the benefit
of the joint select committee’s work on
multiemployer plans last year. We
know what is going on, we know what
is broken, and we know the various op-
tions for repairing the system.
It is time to put pen to paper and fix
these plans that will protect the work-
ers who have paid into them.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
f
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
f
NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this
week we are continuing to confirm
more unobjectionable nominees who
had to move through the Senate more
slowly than they should. Yesterday we
confirmed Sarah Daggett Morrison to
serve as U.S. District Judge for the
Southern District of Ohio, and despite
the fact that our Democratic friends
forced us to file cloture on her nomina-
tion, when she finally received a vote,
she was confirmed 89 to 7.
That is probably because Ms. Morri-
son, like the other nominees we are
considering this week, is thoroughly
noncontroversial and very well-quali-
fied for the job. Thanks to the modest
reforms to the Senate rules we put in
place this spring, more nominees who
fit this description are being confirmed
in a fraction of the time it would have
otherwise taken.
So I hope the strong bipartisan sup-
port we saw yesterday will be shown to
the jurists we will vote to confirm on
the Federal bench today: Pamela Bark-
er to the Northern District of Ohio;
Corey Maze to the Northern District of
Alabama; Rodney Smith to the South-
ern District of Florida; Thomas Barber
to the Middle District of Florida; and
Jean-Paul Boulee to the Northern Dis-
trict of Georgia.
Together, these nominees possess
more than a century of legal experi-
ence. Their résumés include work in
State attorneys’ offices, as county
judges, and as State solicitor general.
They include a former U.S. Army de-
fense counsel and a U.S. Supreme
Court litigator. Each has demonstrated
a commitment to upholding the Con-
stitution and preserving the rule of
law. Each deserves strong, bipartisan
support.
f
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on
another matter, the Trump administra-
tion’s new agreement with Mexico
marks an important breakthrough in
the ongoing border crisis. It kept
harmful tariffs from going into effect
and cemented new steps to make cer-
tain that immigration enforcement and
the rule of law are priorities on both
sides of the border.
But, of course, the Mexican Govern-
ment was not the only outstanding
party with an unmet responsibility to
address this crisis. Right here in Con-
gress we have been waiting for 6 weeks
now—6 weeks—for our Democratic col-
leagues to get serious about the admin-
istration’s urgent request for more re-
sources for border security and human-
itarian efforts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3330 June 12, 2019
This week’s progress with our Mexi-
can neighbors throws the Democrats’
refusal to act into even starker relief.
My colleagues and I have come to the
floor day after day, week after week,
detailing all the evidence that our
southern border is in a state of crisis.
The inflow of would-be illegal immi-
grants is unprecedented. Our facilities
and our efforts to house and care for
the individuals we detain are stretched
literally to the breaking point. In
short, the men and women stationed on
our southern border are running on
fumes. They have been charged with
the tasks that circumstances have
made incredibly difficult, and they are
begging for more funding to keep up.
As I noticed yesterday, the most re-
cent data show that apprehensions last
month reached a 13-year high, with
higher numbers in every category—
more individuals, more family units,
and more unaccompanied children ar-
riving at border facilities that are al-
ready at overcapacity. The Border Pa-
trol is teetering on the brink. They are
nearing the point where they will be
unable to perform even the most basic
humanitarian and security functions
for lack of resources. This is even with
funds being diverted away from other
important priorities at the Department
of Homeland Security on a contingency
basis.
So let me say it again one more time.
The Department of Homeland Security
has had to pull money and people off of
other critical missions just to try and
meet the overwhelming surge of human
traffic down at the border. This is the
Department that includes the Trans-
portation Security Administration, the
Secret Service, and the U.S. Coast
Guard. Congress’s inaction has backed
them into a corner.
The officials who are responsible for
protecting the homeland and safe-
guarding these individuals could not
have been clearer in their pleading to
Congress. They could not have been
more clear. The Acting Homeland Se-
curity Secretary has told us already
that ‘‘given the scale of what we are
facing, we will exhaust our resources
before the end of this fiscal year’’—‘‘ex-
haust our resources before the end of
this fiscal year.’’
The Acting Director of Immigration
and Customs Enforcement has said:
‘‘We are begging.’’ ‘‘Begging.’’ ‘‘We are
asking Congress, please help us.’’
By any honest reckoning, this con-
stitutes a crisis. That is why Ameri-
cans across the entire political spec-
trum agree that Democrats in Congress
need to put aside their allergy to find-
ing an inch of common ground with
President Trump and finally agree to
get something done.
We know exactly what the holdup
has been. The New York Times re-
ported in late May exactly why this
money didn’t make it into the disaster
funding package despite Republican ef-
forts. ‘‘Democrats balked at allocating
billions of dollars more toward border
security.’’ ‘‘Democrats balked.’’ That
is the New York Times.
Around the same time, one House
Democrat admitted as much. He told
reporters: ‘‘In my opinion, we do have
to come up with some money. But
we’ve got to convince our more pro-
gressive friends. . . . ‘’
Well, look, I am sorry that a humani-
tarian crisis is not convincing enough
to the far left. I am sorry that two sep-
arate New York Times editorials
haven’t made an impact on House
Democrats either.
So here we have it. The New York
Times editorial page, May 5—incred-
ibly enough: ‘‘Congress, Give Trump
His Border Money.’’ That is the New
York Times saying: ‘‘Give Trump [the]
border money.’’ They didn’t listen.
So several weeks later, on May 23, as
I quoted, ‘‘Democrats balked at allo-
cating billions of dollars more toward
border security.’’
On June 9, a couple of days ago, in
the New York Times: ‘‘When Will Con-
gress Get Serious About the Suffering
at the Border?’’
Here is the situation. The Trump ad-
ministration and the New York Times
are on the same side—and House Demo-
crats don’t want to take this up? Good-
ness, I am having a hard time remem-
bering the last time the New York
Times editorial page was on the same
side as the Trump administration or
Republicans in Congress. It is not a
common sight, but here we are.
All of us agree that the border crisis
is unacceptable and unsustainable, but
still, House Democrats will not act.
Yesterday, even my colleague the
Democratic leader admitted where this
extended delay is coming from. He told
reporters that the House wasn’t for it,
but we were.
Yes, I guess that was true, but in any
event, apparently that is where we are
now. The House Democrats are the
problem. So if they are serious about
wanting to resolve this, I hope they
will get a grip—get a grip on their far-
left colleagues—in a hurry.
So here is what we are going to do.
Chairman SHELBY has announced that
the Appropriations Committee is going
to vote on a $4.5 billion package a week
from tomorrow, with more than $3 bil-
lion in humanitarian funds to expand
shelter facilities, increase dedicated
care for unaccompanied children, and
another billion dollars to prop up crit-
ical security missions. I am grateful to
Chairman SHELBY for interest in this
and his leadership, along with the work
of Senator CAPITO and Senator BLUNT.
I cannot urge my Democratic friends
strongly enough to finally—what does
it take to convince them to get seri-
ous?—find their way to yes.
House Democrats may want to come
down to the left of the New York Times
editorial page—there is not much space
over there—but the rest of the country
thinks it is just crazy—because it is.
Partisan theater in the House doesn’t
improve the conditions in border shel-
ters. Melodramatic hearings and Presi-
dential harassment don’t secure the
border. ‘‘The resistance’’ doesn’t pay
the bills. This spectacle of opposition
for opposition’s sake, even on such an
obvious nonpartisan priority, has been
more than embarrassing. It is com-
pletely irresponsible. It needs to end
soon.
In the coming days, it will. We are
going to act in the Senate, and we are
going to move forward to find the fund-
ing necessary to try to solve this hu-
manitarian crisis.

ANNIVERSARY OF PULSE
NIGHTCLUB SHOOTING
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President,
on June 12, 2016, our State was at-
tacked. Forty-nine innocent and beau-
tiful lives were senselessly lost, and
the lives of countless families and
loved ones were forever changed.
The attack—an attack on America,
our State, the city of Orlando, our His-
panic and gay communities—was a ter-
rorist attack. This act of terrorism was
an attempt to rip at the seams of our
society, to divide us, to instill fear in
our hearts. But Floridians are strong.
Floridians are selfless. Floridians are
fighters.
The days I spent in Orlando following
the shooting will always be with me. I
talked to many parents who lost their
children. I went to funerals and wakes,
and I sat in hospitals. It was one of the
hardest things I have ever done as Gov-
ernor and as a parent.
Through our State’s most chal-
lenging times, we also saw incredible
bravery and heroism. We saw it in the
brave members of law enforcement who
selflessly ran into danger to help those
in need; we saw it in the doctors and
nurses who tirelessly worked to save
lives; and we saw in the community
that came together after this horrific
tragedy to repair and rebuild.
Three years removed from this un-
imaginable loss, our State is changed
forever. Every year on this day, the
State of Florida stands united with
heavy hearts to honor the victims.
I vow to never forget that evil exists
in this world, and we must always
stand up against those who wish to
harm us. And we vow to always remem-
ber the beautiful lives taken far too
soon.

publican leader, who came to the floor
to speak to the issue of the border cri-
sis which we now face. I acknowledge,
as everyone should, that we are facing
an unprecedented number of people
who are presenting themselves at our
southern border from primarily three
countries—El Salvador, Honduras, and
Guatemala.
These people who are presenting
themselves, for the most part, are not
trying to sneak across our borders;
they are literally coming up and pre-
senting themselves—identifying them-
selves—to the first person they find in
a uniform. The reason is they want to
apply for asylum in the United States.
They want to make the argument that
they have credible fears that might en-
title them to be considered as asylees
in this country, which is a legal classi-
fication.
After they state that they seek that
status, they are taken into our system.
They then, ultimately, go through a
hearing process, but that hearing proc-
ess is not done quickly. In fact, it can
take months and sometimes years be-
fore the actual hearings take place. Be-
cause we are seeing so many people
coming—especially young children who
are accompanied by their parents or
who are even on their own—it has cre-
ated a special challenge for our border
authorities.
I was down in El Paso just a few
weeks ago. I met with the Border Pa-
trol agents and the Customs and Bor-
der Protection agents, and we talked
about the challenges they face. In my
mind, there is no question that the
numbers have overwhelmed the system
to the point at which there are things
happening down there that are abso-
lutely unacceptable by American
standards. I will give you an example.
Those who present themselves at the
border are processed and put into de-
tention cells, but these detention cells
are not large enough to accommodate
the number of people who come to our
border. In El Paso, there was a cell
that had a plate glass window on the
outside so one could see everyone in-
side. Above the door of that cell was a
sign that read ‘‘Capacity: 35.’’ I count-
ed the number of people in that cell on
the day I visited. There were 150 who
were jammed shoulder to shoulder in-
side the cell. About 20 of them, maybe
30, had an opportunity to sit on bench-
es along the perimeter, but for the
most part, they stood. They stood all
day. They were fed their meals while
they stood up, and I have no idea how
they possibly worked out their sleeping
arrangements. There was just no room
for all of them to lie down on the floor
at any given time, and there was one
toilet in that room for 150 people. I
learned afterward that the number in
that cell increased shortly thereafter
to 200. Next to it was a cell for
women—capacity 16. Inside that cell, I
counted 75 women, including women
with nursing babies.
We now have press reports that state,
because of the desperate situation
these detainees face, there have been
attempted suicides. This is in the
United States of America. This is a sit-
uation we need to address. I couldn’t
agree more with the Republican leader
from Kentucky that we need humani-
tarian assistance quickly to provide
temporary housing or whatever is nec-
essary so that there will be humane
treatment of those who have been de-
tained at our borders until they are
processed through our legal system.
I might say, although the Republican
leader came to the floor to blame the
Democrats for not coming up with
more money in a timely fashion, it was
just this February when we joined, on a
bipartisan basis, in voting for $400 mil-
lion more for humanitarian assistance
at the border. There has been no resist-
ance from this Senator or from this
side of the aisle when it has come to
humanitarian assistance in addressing
the issues that have been before us.
We remember—and it was not that
long ago—the Trump administration’s
policy that was called zero tolerance.
Do you remember? Certainly, I do. At-
torney General Jeff Sessions an-
nounced that we were then going to
have a policy of treating as criminals
those who came across the border.
Now, understand what I mentioned
earlier. You present yourself at our
border for the purpose of seeking
asylee status so that you will not be
considered a criminal when you present
yourself, which is perfectly within our
legal system. Rather, Jeff Sessions
said, if you come to our border and do
not have legal status in the United
States, you shall be treated as a crimi-
nal. In his having said that, there was
a problem. It meant that they sepa-
rated the children from their parents
because, under Sessions’ zero-tolerance
policy, the parents were presumed to
have been engaged in criminal conduct.
The result was awful. There were
2,880 infants, toddlers, and children
who were separated from their parents
at the border under the zero-tolerance
policy. Yet there was a swift public re-
action against it, and court cases were
filed to stop this policy. In one of the
few times since he was elected Presi-
dent, this President came forward and
said he was wrong—that this policy
was not good and that he was going to
end it.
The problem was, in his having sepa-
rated those children, our government
has not kept track of where their par-
ents have gone and how we might pos-
sibly reunite them in the future. It
took a Federal judge in Southern Cali-
fornia to come forward and mandate
that our agencies of government find
those children and reunite them with
their parents.
We didn’t accomplish it completely.
Overwhelmingly, it took weeks and
months for us to put them together be-
cause no one thought to keep track of
where the parents were headed and
where their children were headed.
Eventually, we put it together for all
but, say, 100, I think—the final number
of children for whom we just couldn’t
find their families and parents.
That was a horrible situation, but it
is a reminder to us today as we reflect
on what is going on at the border. For
goodness’ sake, we should all demand
the humane treatment of people at our
border, particularly of the children. Six
children who came to our border died
while they sought this asylum status.
That is unacceptable.
In fairness to the Department of
Homeland Security and to all of those
involved in it, I don’t believe for a sec-
ond that they consciously allowed this
to happen, but we did not provide the
kind of medical assistance that might
have ordinarily been provided in these
circumstances. We are told that this is
changing for the better, and I salute
and applaud the efforts to reach that.
When it comes to the humanitarian
assistance that Senator MCCONNELL

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3332 June 12, 2019
spoke about on the floor this morning,
I could not agree with him more. We
need to put the resources in place.
There are serious differences of opinion
about the policy at the border—of the
so-called Flores consent decree and the
TVPRA legislation. There is also no
common agreement between the par-
ties in the House and Senate on that
policy’s language. I am not sure we will
reach an agreement when it comes to
some fundamental questions about how
long you can hold a child in detention,
for example. In the Flores decision—
and this was a consent decree entered
into by our government—we say that
you can’t detain a child for more than
20 days. The proposal now is 100 days.
Let me ask an obvious question. As a
father and as a grandfather, what im-
pact does it have in one’s holding a
child in detention for 100 days? Imag-
ine, if you will, all of the possible cir-
cumstances of these kids in their hav-
ing come to the border, what they have
been through to reach this point, and
what we then do in response. I think we
need to be very sensitive to the reality
that children are often harmed in ways
we can’t even imagine by things that
happen so early in their lives. The no-
tion of a longer detention needs to be
carefully scrutinized to make sure we
are never doing anything at the ex-
pense of these children and their long-
term development.
I wanted to raise another issue too.
While I agree with Senator MCCONNELL
when it comes to the humanitarian
treatment of children and young people
and others, too, at the same time, we
are in a circumstance now where the
President of the United States, in Sep-
tember of 2017, eliminated a program
called the DACA Program.
I know a little bit about this because
18 years ago I introduced a bill called
the DREAM Act, and the DREAM Act
said that if you were brought to the
United States as a child, where you
didn’t have any conscious part of the
decision to come to this country, and
you grew up in this country, went to
school, did not have a criminal record,
and went through a basic background
test, then, you ought to be able to be
allowed to stay in the United States
and ultimately achieve legal status.
That is the DREAM Act. We haven’t
passed it or enacted it into law, though
I have tried many, many times. But we
did prevail on President Obama to cre-
ate the DACA Program so that these
young people can step forward, pay a
fee, go through a background check, be
finger-printed, make certain that they
were no threat to the United States,
and be allowed to stay in this country
for 2 years at a time without fear of de-
portation and be allowed to work.
Ultimately, 790,000 of these young
people came forward. I have told their
stories on the floor of the Senate
many, many times. They are incredible
young people who simply want a
chance to be a part of the country—the
only country they have ever known.
President Trump decided to abolish
the DACA Program, leaving these
190,000 people in a precarious situation
in terms of their legal rights and their
future.
Fortunately for them, the Federal
Court stepped in and said that the
President needed to justify eliminating
this program. While we are going
through the argument in court, they
will be protected—790,000 will be pro-
tected. No new ones have been allowed
to sign up.
I see that my friend from New York
is here, and I just wish, if I can, to
make a statement about one of these
Dreamers and then yield the floor to
him. I am certain that he has some im-
portant things to say.
But I would like to, if I can—he helps
me with my signs when he comes to
the floor. I thank Senator SCHUMER.
I produced on the floor more than 100
of these colored photographs of these
Dreamers to tell their story. This is
Pratishtha Khanna, the 117th Dreamer
I have spoken about on the floor of the
Senate. She was brought to the United
States from India at the age of 10, and
she grew up in Laurel, MD. Her parents
were university graduates with profes-
sional degrees. They both worked long
hours in blue collar jobs for less than
minimum wage with no time off.
Pratishtha said:
My parents believed in the hallmarks of
American values: Work hard and you can
achieve anything. They encouraged me to
study hard and be the best I can be.
This is exactly what this young lady
did. She was an excellent student who
was placed in the gifted and talented
program, and she was a peer mentor
who tutored fellow students in math.
In high school, Pratishtha earned col-
lege credits in an advanced placement
class, was a member of the color guard,
and served as treasurer and vice presi-
dent of the student government asso-
ciation.
In 2009 she graduated from high
school with honors. She attended her
local community college. Because of
her undocumented immigration status,
she was not eligible for financial aid
and had to pay international student
tuition. She cleaned homes and tutored
high school students to help pay the
tuition. She volunteered at a local in-
fectious disease laboratory. She grad-
uated with an associate’s degree in bi-
ology.
Then, on June 15, 2012, President
Obama announced DACA, the program
I mentioned earlier, which was abol-
ished by President Trump.
Pratishtha says:
[It was] a monumental day for my family.
For the first time in many years, my family
sat together to eat dinner. I saw tears
stream down my father’s face. He talked
about everything my brother and I could
achieve with the basic scraps of dignity
given us by DACA. The stress and despair in
his eyes was replaced with energy and hope.
In May 2014 Pratishtha graduated
with honors with a bachelor’s degree in
biological sciences from the University
of Maryland, Baltimore County. Fol-
lowing graduation, she worked as a
scribe in the emergency department at
Baltimore Washington Hospital Center.
She kept studying, obtaining a nursing
assistant and patient care technician
certification. She then obtained a posi-
tion at the medical intensive care unit
at Johns Hopkins, while she continued
working in the emergency department
at Baltimore Washington Medical Cen-
ter.
Her father passed away in November
of 2015, just a few years after she was
given DACA status. Through long night
shifts in the ICU and the 5 a.m. shifts
in the emergency department,
Pratishtha had become the family’s
breadwinner.
She is now studying for a master of
science in biomedical science at West-
ern University of Health Sciences, in
Pomona, CA. Her dream is to become a
doctor.
She wrote me a letter, and she said:
America is my home. My father’s ashes
will lay to rest here. I don’t have another
home. As assaults on immigrants and democ-
racy run rampant, the world looks to Con-
gress for leadership and justice.
The eyes of Pratishtha and hundreds
of thousands of Dreamers are on Wash-
ington and on the U.S. Senate. Last
week the House of Representatives
passed the American Dream and Prom-
ise Act in an effort to save Pratishtha
and the hundreds of thousands of oth-
ers like her. We want you to be a part
of America’s future. You are an ex-
traordinary person. Her life and what
she has already given are an indication
of why we need her in America’s fu-
ture. The fact that the Republican
leader would come to the floor and
speak about the humanitarian treat-
ment of young children and overlook
the fact that we have a bill that has
been sent to us by the House of Rep-
resentatives, which would help 790,000
and more with the American Dream
and Promise Act, tells me that he is
not closing in the loop on humani-
tarianism.
I call on the Republican leader in the
Senate: Do not make this a legislative
graveyard. Let’s use the power of this
Senate to pass the legislation that
passed the House of Representatives
and give this young woman and thou-
sands more just like her an oppor-
tunity to be a part of America’s future.
I yield the floor.
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader is recognized.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, let me
thank my dear friend, the senior Sen-
ator from Illinois, for the passion, per-
sistence, and intelligence he shows on
behalf of the Dreamers, who simply
want to be Americans, who have shown
their part of the American dream, and
whom we are truly blocking from
achieving their dream—which is the
American dream.
Thank you.
SEPTEMBER 11TH VICTIM COMPENSATION FUND
ACT
Now, on another matter, Mr. Presi-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3333
June 12, 2019
Judiciary Committee unanimously
passed a bill to address the shortfall in
the September 11th Victim Compensa-
tion Fund, which provides aid to the
heroes and the families of the heroes
who rushed to the towers selflessly on
September 11, 2001.
Even in a divided Congress, even in a
divided country, this issue is an abso-
lute issue of moral clarity. On that
fateful day, the men and women of the
New York Fire Department, the New
York Police Department, the EMS, and
the construction labor unions who
rushed to Ground Zero were like our
soldiers. Like our soldiers, they rushed
to danger for our safety without think-
ing of their own, and just as we don’t
leave soldiers on the battlefield behind,
we must not leave the brave first re-
sponders behind when it comes to their
healthcare. Yet, shamefully, it has al-
ways been a struggle here in this Con-
gress to abide by that principle.
I have lived through the years when
everyone said the first responders are
getting respiratory illnesses and can-
cers they hadn’t seen in such young
people. They said they were crazy for
thinking that it came from the pile. I
lived through the years when, even
though the science eventually con-
firmed that 9/11 was the cause, some in
Congress complained that it was too
expensive to provide these heroes with
the healthcare they so very needed.
Then, some said: This is a New York
issue, and we are not going to help—as
if we care about where our soldiers
come from when they die on the battle-
field.
After years of struggle, we eventu-
ally passed a healthcare program, but,
initially, it wasn’t even permanent. We
have to fight every time when there is
a problem, every time we need an ex-
tension, and every time it needs more
funding. It is a painful and slow proc-
ess, a difficult process, one that should
never have been the way it has been.
Every single one of the times, those
brave first responders have had to
come here to testify, wheeling through
the halls of Congress, their bodies rid-
dled with cancer, to beg Senators and
Congressmen to help them get their
healthcare.
My good friend, my dear friend Ray
Pfeiffer—God bless his memory—who
knew he was dying, would come down
here again and again and again, not for
himself—he knew it was too late for
him—but to make sure his friends and
their families got the help they needed.
It is shameful—there is no other
word for it; shameful—that our great
first responders have had to suffer the
indignity of delay after delay after
delay, of searching for some must-pass
bill to tuck their issue into because
this Congress, this Senate, did not
think it was important enough to pass
it on its own.
Let me tell you something. We are
done with that. We are not doing this
again—not this time. The House Judi-
ciary Committee just passed the fix to
the Victim’s Compensation Fund. The
full House will follow suit soon.
As soon as the House passes this bill,
it should be on the floor of the Senate
immediately as a stand-alone bill.
Once this bill passes the House, there
will be only one person who stands be-
tween the brave first responders now
suffering from cancer and illness and
the money they need to save or extend
their lives, and that one person is
Leader MCCONNELL.
So I say to Leader MCCONNELL: This
is not politics. This is not a game.
These are our heroes—American heroes
who are suffering and need our help.
Your help, Leader MCCONNELL, is need-
ed now. I am imploring, pleading, even
begging to Leader MCCONNELL to put
this bill on the floor immediately after
it passes the House. I am imploring, I
am pleading, I am begging Leader
MCCONNELL to give us a commitment
today that, as soon as the House passes
this bill, he will put it on the floor of
the Senate as a stand-alone bill.
Once he puts it on the floor of the
Senate, it will pass the Senate with
strong bipartisan support. This is not a
Democratic or Republican issue. The
President will sign it. The brave heroes
who have come down here time and
again will breathe a sigh of relief,
knowing they and their families, even
if they are gone, will get the help they
deserve.
We will reach the point soon—most
likely this year—when more will have
died from 9/11 related illnesses than on
9/11 itself. It has been over 17 years
since 9/11, but, unfortunately, brave
Americans are still dying. Brave Amer-
icans are still finding the cancers that
were caused by their rushing to the
pile, but only discovering them now.
Let’s do our job. Let’s take care of
them now.
ANNIVERSARY OF PULSE NIGHTCLUB SHOOTING
Mr. President, today marks the 3-
year anniversary of the Pulse night-
club shooting in Orlando, FL. On that
horrible night, 49 people were killed, 53
wounded and many more forever
changed in an unspeakable act of ter-
ror.
The shooting was traumatic not only
as an act of brutal violence, but as a
hate crime against the LGBTQ commu-
nity. The shooter chose the Pulse
nightclub; drove a long way specifi-
cally to Pulse. And he did it in order to
target innocent people for the simple
reason of being who they were.
Today, our hearts are with the vic-
tims’ families, with the first respond-
ers, and with the city of Orlando. We
also cannot help but remember that we
are the only nation in the developed
world where mass shootings happen
with such regularity, many of them
driven by hate. We will never be able to
root out all the evil, malice, and hate
in our society, but I also know that we
will never see a great reduction in gun
violence or in hate crimes if we do
nothing. So as we remember the vic-
tims of Pulse, let us also act. Let us
consider legislation to improve com-
mon sense gun safety.
We have a bill ready, sent to us by
the House months ago, to fix loopholes
in our federal background check sys-
tem. But Leader MCCONNELL has not
allowed it to reach the floor. Why not?
Why is it one of the many forgotten
bills of his legislative graveyard? Are
Republicans so unwilling to buck the
gun lobby that they will ignore a bill
supported of 90 percent of Americans,
the majority of Republicans, the ma-
jority of gun owners? Something needs
to change. My Republicans friends need
to break out of the vise grip of the
NRA.
I urge Leader MCCONNELL to get this
Chamber working again for the good of
the American people. Commonsense
background checks would be a great
place to start—today of all days.
HONG KONG
Mr. President, finally, 30 years and
one week ago, democratic protestors
gathered at Tiananmen Square, where
the Chinese Communist Party brutally
suppressed the will of the people.
Today, in Hong Kong, a similar scene
is playing out. The Chinese govern-
ment is once again showing its true
colors, suppressing democracy, denying
the will of the people, trying to claw
back more power and control.
The people of Hong Kong are right-
fully protesting the Chinese govern-
ment’s interest in remanding poten-
tially innocent people to mainland
China in order to put them through the
corrupt Chinese prison system.
America stands with the people of
Hong Kong in their protest against this
blatant abuse of power by the govern-
ment in Beijing.
I yield the floor.

NEY). The Senator from Alabama.
EQUALITY ACT
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, today I
rise to talk about a matter that is very
close to my heart and rooted in my
faith and belief that we are all God’s
children created in God’s image. It is
an issue of fundamental equality, of
basic human dignity, and it is con-
sistent with the values we strive to em-
body as American citizens.
I stand today to honor the contribu-
tions of LGBTQ Americans—the con-
tributions they have given so selflessly
to our Nation—and to remind all of my
colleagues of the great risks these
Americans still face simply because of
who they love and who they are.
It was 50 years ago this month that
the gay community finally rose up.
The Stonewall riots were a product of a
brutal police force cracking down on
the gay community. They found a
voice that others had in the previous
years. This Pride Month, June, we cele-
brate that 50 years of a rise in the
voice of people to be treated just basi-
cally as everyone else. It is an impor-
tant issue for me. It is an important
issue for a number of reasons—first and
foremost, because I am a father, but
also, I am a product of the Deep South
in which I was raised. As a kid, I came
of age during a very tumultuous time
in our Nation’s history, a very tumul-
tuous time in Alabama.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3334 June 12, 2019
When I was a kid, our schools re-
mained segregated for years after the
Brown v. Board of Education decision,
and my Black peers faced very difficult
and different prospects for their future
in life, which was a direct result of the
Jim Crow laws that were still on the
books in my childhood.
Men, women, and children were regu-
larly targeted for violent attacks sim-
ply because of the color of their skin,
the way they were born, and their au-
dacity—their audacity to yearn for
freedom and love and acceptance and
respect.
The wounds of those years left scars
that are still visible in many places
today—many places not just in Ala-
bama but across the country. The in-
equality and divisive rhetoric of the
time and the tensions it fomented
fueled the violence and tragedy that
were wrought upon so many innocent
people, especially in the 1950s and in
the 1960s in Alabama, in the Deep
South, and so many other places across
this land.
I raise this because history has
shown us time and again that when our
government sanctions discrimination
or merely turns a blind eye to it, we
cause irreparable harm to those people.
In doing so, we also turn our backs on
the fundamental promise of this great
country—that we are all endowed with
certain unalienable rights, ‘‘all’’ being
the key word in that phrase. We are all
endowed with certain unalienable
rights.
Without exception, policies of legal-
ized discrimination that are fueled by
fear always become a black mark on
our Nation’s history. Today, we can re-
flect on those incidents from the civil
rights movement with more clarity and
take pride in the significant progress
we have made over time, but what we
cannot do is delude ourselves into
thinking this work is nearly concluded.
There is still work to be done with re-
gard to gay rights. There is still work
to be done when you consider that
LGBTQ people in this country are still
not guaranteed permanent Federal pro-
tection against discrimination—they
are still not. There is still work to be
done when we see that the LGBTQ
community youth are five times more
likely to attempt suicide than their
heterosexual peers—five times more
likely to commit suicide. And we know
there is still work to be done when
LGBTQ youth are more likely to be-
come homeless and to face physical and
sexual exploitation.
Our former colleague in this body
who was here for such a long time—he
was here when I worked in the Senate
in 1979 and 1980—Republican Senator
Orrin Hatch of Utah spoke passionately
on this floor last year, making an im-
portant point about the scope of the
challenge we still face. He said:
Ensuring that our LGBT friends feel loved
and accepted is not a political issue; we all
have a stake in this. We all have family or
loved ones who have felt marginalized in one
way or another because of gender identity or
sexual orientation, and we need to be there
for them.
Senator Hatch. I miss him, even
though I am glad my friend from Utah
is here.
Instead of love and acceptance, how-
ever, too often the LGBTQ community
still faces hate, violence, and discrimi-
nation in the workplace, in the class-
room, in the housing market, and,
more and more, in our society.
In fact, today we remember the lives
of 49 innocent people who were sense-
lessly murdered in Orlando, FL, 3 years
ago at Pulse, an LGBTQ nightclub.
Just last week, a Detroit man was
charged with first-degree murder for
killing three LGBTQ people in an ap-
parent hate crime.
In my home State of Alabama, a
local mayor recently made headlines
around the country for advocating the
killing of LGBTQ people, claiming it
was the only way to ‘‘fix’’ the problem.
In Washington, DC, over the week-
end, a panic ensued and thousands fled
for their lives when it was believed
there was an active shooter targeting
the city’s annual Pride parade.
In Alabama, young Nigel Shelby, a
high school freshman from Huntsville,
ended his life this past spring after en-
during bullying from his peers and
struggling through bouts of depression.
Mourning her son, his heartbroken
mother called him the ‘‘sweetest
child.’’ She said Nigel was ‘‘always full
of joy, full of light.’’ As a father, I can-
not begin to imagine the pain she and
her family have experienced at this
sudden loss. But I will tell you, as the
father of a gay son, I have had to imag-
ine the pain and uncertainty her child
must have felt in a world in which he
didn’t feel fully accepted.
These incidents are just a few of the
most recent examples I could share.
Quite frankly, I have hesitated to even
mention incidents in Alabama because
we sometimes have the stigma of dis-
crimination in my State.
Most recently in Alabama, the Ala-
bama Legislature passed a most re-
strictive law dealing with abortion and
women’s rights. It was a callous law,
and once again people are looking at
Alabama and saying: What is going on?
They look at this smalltown mayor
and say: What is going on? But let me
tell you, folks, for anybody who is lis-
tening to this, that is not Alabama.
That is not the people of Alabama.
That may be a gerrymandered legisla-
ture that represents only a small seg-
ment, but that is not the good people I
know across the State of Alabama. Re-
gardless of their political persuasion,
regardless of their age, regardless of
their religion, those instances do not
represent the great State of Alabama.
Those are the most recent examples,
but it is clear that the fear LGBTQ
people can feel is by no means un-
founded.
In this Pride Month, while we cele-
brate the LGBT community and the
right for everyone to live and love as
they choose, we cannot forget that for
this community, there is still much
work to be done. That is why I have co-
sponsored and I am so proud to cospon-
sor the Equality Act, and I urge my
colleagues to do the same. Our col-
leagues in the House of Representa-
tives have already passed this legisla-
tion, which fills a gap in our Nation’s
Federal civil rights laws by providing
permanent protections for the LGBTQ
community regardless of where they
live.
This act is an important step. It is
not a silver bullet, but it is an incred-
ible, important step forward in what
we can do to recognize the dignity of
all people in this country.
Right now, these protections are sim-
ply a patchwork of State laws and
other regulations. In 30 States, includ-
ing Alabama, LGBTQ people are at risk
of being fired, evicted, or denied other
services because of their sexual ori-
entation or gender.
I urge my colleagues to look at who
is supporting the Equality Act. This is
not a bipartisan issue; this is a non-
partisan issue. If you look at the over
500 organizations, a couple of hundred
major corporations—the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce has endorsed this bill and
is urging its passage because so many
across the country recognize the im-
portance of these protections.
How many times have you seen busi-
nesses and how many times have you
seen the chamber—and I mean no dis-
respect to them—endorse a law that
bans discrimination when they know it
puts certain burdens on their mem-
bers? This is a historic opportunity
that we have here—a historic oppor-
tunity—and we need to take advantage
of it.
According to the Public Religion Re-
search Institute, a majority of people
in every State support a law like this,
including a majority of the folks in
Alabama. Those majorities extend
across party lines, religion, and demo-
graphics, but despite most Americans
being on the same page about this, the
minority in opposition to this bill and
in opposition to the LGBTQ commu-
nity in general seems to be firm. It
seems to be solid. It seems to be vocal.
Opposition to such expansions of civil
rights protections usually is.
From where I sit, this is not a zero-
sum game. My view on this is informed
by my experience. Most of what we do
here is informed by experience, and my
view on this issue is informed by my
own experience as a father, as someone
who loves his son very much—as any
parent loves their son. It is informed
by my experience as a lawyer, having
spent my career working for justice.
No matter where the downtrodden
might be, I have spent my career work-
ing to make sure people are treated the
same under the law, knowing that if
you can change those laws and you can
get treated the same under the law,
hearts and minds will follow. We have
seen it happen time and again.
My view is informed by my religion,
my religion as a Christian and my be-
lief that we are called upon to love one

another. It is the same and similar
view expressed by our colleague Orrin
Hatch in his floor speech last year.
We are called to stand up and fight
for equal treatment and dignity of our
fellow human beings—dignity and re-
spect—to fight for people like my tal-
ented and compassionate son Carson
and for all other sons, daughters,
nieces, nephews, grandsons, grand-
daughters, friends, and neighbors, all
out there who deserve to pursue a full,
free, joyous, and loving life.
Today the Senate has an opportunity
to stand up and make a very clear
statement that we will not allow State
government-sanctioned discrimination
of LGBTQ people. We will not continue
to allow that discrimination to con-
tinue, but we have to make that stand,
and that stand can start right here. It
has already started in the House.
The time is now to send a message.
The time is now to send a message to
all people—to all people across this
country—that we in the U.S Senate be-
lieve that all people deserve to live
with dignity, free from the fear of dis-
crimination.
As I prepared these remarks and I
read through them and made changes, I
thought about my old boss whose seat
I now fill, Howell Heflin. It was in the
1990s that Howell Heflin from Alabama,
a son of the South whose relatives
fought in the Civil War, stood before
this body and said that it was time to
remove the Confederate battle flag
from all Federal Government-sanc-
tioned emblems. It was a bold state-
ment. Now we have a son of the South
standing up for what in the Bible Belt
is that love and respect, a son of the
South who is now talking about his
family, talking about discrimination,
and reaching out to people across the
aisle and within my own party to say
that it is time; it is time to make that
move.
So I ask my colleagues to take this
step with me, to do the right thing by
calling on Leader MCCONNELL to bring
this legislation to a vote in the U.S.
Senate. Let all 100 Senators stand up
and be counted one way or another.
Every voice counts. Let every U.S.
Senator say where they are by a vote
on the Equality Act and to do it sooner
rather than later.
This is a matter of civil rights, this
is a matter of human rights, and this is
a matter of being on the right side of
history. We have an important oppor-
tunity right now to get it right. It is
right now. It is the right time.
Thank you.

NOMINATIONS AND BORDER SECURITY
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, to borrow
from Yogi Berra, it is deja vu all over
again in the Senate this week. Once
again, the Senate is taking up a lot of
judicial nominations, and, once again,
we will spend a lot of time considering
noncontroversial nominees.
Now my colleagues across the aisle
have started to complain about the
Senate’s focus on nominations. I am
pretty frustrated myself, not because
we are considering these nominees—it
is our constitutional duty, after all—
but because we are being forced to
spend so much time on their nomina-
tions, but that is what my Democratic
colleagues have obliged us to do.
Back in the day, most of the judicial
nominees we are considering would
have been confirmed without the time-
consuming cloture vote process. By
this point in President Obama’s first
term, Republicans had required cloture
votes on just three of President
Obama’s judicial nominees—three, Mr.
President.
Contrast that with today. As of June
5, Democrats have required cloture
votes on 76 of President Trump’s judi-
cial nominees—76 to 3. Now, of course,
some might leap to the conclusion that
this is not obstruction for obstruc-
tion’s sake. They might assume that
President Trump has been nominating
unqualified or deeply controversial
candidates for judicial office, and the
Democrats have no alternative but to
obstruct and delay the nominations—
except that is not the case because
Democrats have repeatedly made it
clear that they have no problem with
many of the President’s nominations
by turning around and voting for the
same people they have obstructed.
That is right. Again and again,
Democrats have voted in favor of the
very same nominees they have delayed.
Take Monday and Tuesday’s confirma-
tion votes on two nominees for district
judge. Democrats forced cloture votes
on both nominees. Yet when it came
time to confirm them, Democrats
turned around and supported the nomi-
nations. One nominee received the sup-
port of 24 Democrats, including the
Democratic whip, while the other
nominee was confirmed with the sup-
port of 39 Democrats, almost the entire
Democratic caucus.
Democrats aren’t obstructing be-
cause they oppose all or even most of
President Trump’s nominees; they are
obstructing because they still can’t get
over the 2016 election. It has been 21⁄2
years since the last Presidential elec-
tion—21⁄2 years. We are closer to the
next Presidential election than to the
last. Yet Democrats still can’t let the
2016 election go.
I realize their preferred candidate did
not win, and I realize they are not fans
of President Trump, but Democrats act
like they are the only people who have
ever lost an election, like they are the
first to have to deal with a candidate
they don’t like.
To my Democratic colleagues across
the aisle, I would like to say: Welcome
to life in our democracy. Welcome to
life in a free country. While it is never
fun, sometimes your candidate is going
to lose. That is what happens when you
have free elections.
I am not suggesting that Democrats
should start rubberstamping every
item on the President’s agenda. They
have serious philosophical disagree-
ments with the President’s policies,
and it is right that they should air
them, but to reflexively oppose every-
thing the President says or does simply
because he is the President is deeply ir-
responsible. There are serious con-
sequences to pointlessly delaying
nominees, such as backlogs in our
court system or a government that
isn’t functioning the way it should be-
cause of vacancies in leadership posi-
tions.
There are even more serious and im-
mediate consequences to obstructing
other measures. Right now, Democrats
are holding up desperately needed fund-
ing for the serious humanitarian and
security crisis at our southern border
simply because it is the President mak-
ing the funding request. The security
of our country and the well-being of
tens of thousands of immigrants are at
stake, and Democrats are refusing to
address the situation because they
don’t like the President.
In the first 8 months of this fiscal
year, nearly 411,000 unaccompanied
children and families have crossed our
southern border, more than in any pre-
vious full year. Resources are stretched
to the breaking point. Shelters are
overloaded, and providing adequate
medical care is becoming more and
more difficult. Federal agencies are
simply running out of money. Money
appropriated for the care of unaccom-
panied children could run out by the
end of this month. That means care-
givers for these children would have to
work without pay, and private organi-
zations with Federal grants to care for
these children would go without their
funding.
Democrats like to style themselves
as the party of openness and compas-
sion, and yet they are willing to ignore
a humanitarian crisis of massive pro-
portions out of political spite—not to
mention the serious security issue.
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity is being forced to divert resources
to deal with the humanitarian crisis
pulling more than 700 Customs and
Border Protection Officers from legal
points of entry to assist with the surge
of migrants.
I don’t think there is a Member in
this body who wouldn’t agree on the
importance of fully staffing our ports
and cargo processing so we don’t create
new vulnerabilities, but Customs and
Border Protection is left with little
choice.
After 21⁄2 years of unprecedented par-
tisanship and obstruction from Demo-
crats, I would like to think that the
Democrats would finally turn their
focus to the business of government.
Unfortunately, I think it is more likely
that their obstruction will continue
and that we will see a lot more point-
less delays when it comes to nominees

and more difficulty getting Democrats
to work with us on legislation.
I do hope—I do hope Democrats can
hold their relentless obstruction long
enough to provide humanitarian relief
along our southern border and to ad-
dress the increasingly precarious secu-
rity situation. It doesn’t seem like too
much to ask.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
LANKFORD). The Senator from Rhode
Island.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I
came here to make my climate re-
marks, but I can’t resist the oppor-
tunity—both as a Senator who actually
gets quite a lot of bipartisan legisla-
tion passed with my Republican friends
but also somebody who sits on the Ju-
diciary Committee—to point out that
there actually are quite a few firsts
happening that I think help explain
why the floor has become a battle-
ground for so many of these nominees.
One first has been that this is the
first time, I think, in anybody in the
Senate’s lifetime experience in which
the blue slip is not honored for circuit
court judges, in which a judge on the
circuit court of appeals associated with
the Presiding Officer’s State of Okla-
homa or my State of Rhode Island—we
get rolled. We do not have the ability
to approve or disapprove those judges.
That is a long tradition of the Senate
summarily thrown out.
This is the first time, I think in the
history of the United States, in which
the selection of judges is being done by
a private group funded with anony-
mous money. That is a very bizarre
way to go about picking judges. That is
the way it is taking place right now. In
fact, the gentleman named Leonard
Leo from the Federalist Society who is
doing the picking was admitted by
Trump’s legal counsel to have been
insourced for the selection process.
That is a first. We never had a private
organization pick our Federal judges
funded with anonymous money.
Finally, there are some qualified ap-
pointees to the bench. I voted for a
considerable number, when I thought
they were qualified. The problem is,
when the unqualified ones come
through, they get stuffed through just
like anyone else. It is a rarity when we
get somebody so flagrantly unqualified
as the lawyer who did not know what a
motion in limine was—a standard mo-
tion before any trial in a Federal
court—had no idea what it was. It was
actually a Republican Senator who was
able to determine that and asked fur-
ther questions because, frankly, it is
pretty astounding to want to be a trial
judge and not know what that is. So
there have been some firsts, and if we
could go back to where we were before-
hand, I think we would see a smoother
process.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. President, I am here today for
my weekly ‘‘Time to Wake up’’ speech.
We know a lot of things now. We
know our atmosphere is filling with
carbon dioxide to a point unprece-
dented in the history of the species on
our planet; we know global tempera-
tures are climbing and warping the
weather across our country and around
the world; we know our oceans are
warming and acidifying in a way that
the geologic record shows is a pre-
cursor to massive ocean die-offs; and
we know the kind of action we must
take to stop these changes and to avoid
their worst consequences. We have
known this, in fact, for a very long
time.
However, the fossil fuel industry, just
like the tobacco industry before it,
whose apparatus it appropriated for
this purpose, used phony manufactured
doubt as its weapon of choice to fight
against climate action. For decades,
the fossil fuel industry and its armada
of phony front groups waged a delib-
erate campaign of lies, propaganda, and
political pressure. At the vanguard of
this effort was ExxonMobil—America’s
largest and most influential oil com-
pany.
Internal reports uncovered by
InsideClimate News show just how well
Exxon privately understood the cli-
mate science, even before the public
was aware of the issue.
This graphic shows the cover page of
an internal Exxon briefing, prepared by
Exxon scientists in 1982—1982—to in-
form Exxon management about what
they termed ‘‘the CO2 greenhouse ef-
fect.’’ The report says it was not to be
distributed outside the company.
Exxon scientists reported to Exxon
management in this 1982 report that
there is ‘‘little doubt’’ that atmos-
pheric CO2 concentrations were in-
creasing and increasing due to fossil
fuel burning. They state in this report
that the resulting greenhouse effect
‘‘would warm the earth’s surface, caus-
ing changes in climate affecting atmos-
pheric and ocean temperatures, rainfall
patterns, soil moisture, and . . . poten-
tially melting the polar ice caps.’’
That was in 1982.
In 1982, Exxon also projected future
global temperature increase based on
their own expectations of fossil fuel
burning. The Exxon modeling projected
that by 2019, atmospheric CO2 would
reach between 390 and 420 parts per
million. This in a band of 170 to 200
parts per million that had prevailed
through the entire history of our spe-
cies on the planet for millions of years.
They predicted we would jump out of
that boundary to between 390 and 420
parts per million, and they predicted
then that global average temperature
in 2019 would be around 1 degree Cel-
sius warmer.
Fast-forward from 1982 to today. It is
2019, and guess what. CO2 concentra-
tions are currently 415 parts per mil-
lion. And guess what. Temperature has,
in fact, increased about 1 degree Cel-
sius. In 1982, Exxon scientists almost
perfectly predicted how fossil fuel
burning would warm the world and told
Exxon management in this report. The
scientists understood the damage this
warming would go on to cause, and
they knew it was bad.
Exxon scientists predicted to the
company that temperature would in-
crease 2 degrees Celsius by 2050 and 3
degrees Celsius by 2080.
Among the report’s warnings is this:
There could be considerable adverse im-
pact including the flooding of some coastal
land masses as a result of a rising sea level
due to melting of the Antarctic ice sheet.
. . . Such a rise would cause flooding on
much of the U.S. East Coast, including the
state of Florida and Washington, D.C.
Exxon’s 1982 report stated that unre-
strained carbon emissions have the po-
tential to cause ‘‘great irreversible
harm to our planet.’’ ‘‘Irreversible.’’
Interestingly, that is a word Donald
Trump and his family used about cli-
mate change in 2009 when they signed
this full-page ad in the New York
Times calling climate science irref-
utable and saying that the effects of
climate change would be ‘‘catastrophic
and irreversible.’’ Yes, those Trumps.
Exxon understood that there was nat-
ural variability in the climate system.
Before humankind began emitting
massive amounts of carbon pollution
into the atmosphere, global average
temperature fluctuated by around half
a degree Celsius on either side of its
long-term average. This natural vari-
ation allowed Exxon to claim that an
increase in global temperatures of up
to half a degree Celsius could be due to
natural causes.
This chart from the Exxon report ex-
plains that the signal would become
undeniable—no half-degree-Celsius ex-
cuse—the signal would become undeni-
able that this was human-caused
warming around the year 2000.
Exxon also understood that we need-
ed to act quickly to head off the worst
harm. Here is what Exxon’s scientists
told the company: ‘‘Once the effects
are measurable, they might not be re-
versible and little could be done to cor-
rect the situation in the short term.’’
Exxon scientists knew what had to be
done: ‘‘Mitigation of the greenhouse ef-
fect would require major reductions in
fossil fuel combustion.’’
In 1982, 37 years ago, Exxon under-
stood climate science very well. They
understood the uncertainties. They
knew how much global temperature
could increase. They pegged it nearly
perfectly. And they knew the damage
climate change would do, and they told
Exxon management.
What did management do with this
knowledge? Did they invest in low-car-
bon energy to develop the technologies
needed to avert a future catastrophe?
Did they work with governments on
policies that would reduce carbon
emissions and climate risk? Did they
use their political might to move car-
bon capture front and center? No. In-
stead, they set out on a campaign to
sow false doubt about climate science,
to attack climate scientists, to block
any good climate policy, and, of course,
to extract and sell ever more fossil
fuel. They knew it would be at the ex-
pense of the rest of society. They knew

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3337

it would be at the expense of future
generations. They knew it would cause
great, irreversible harm. They did it
anyway.
Here are some highlights from
Exxon’s false-doubt campaign.
In 1996, 14 years after the 1982 report,
Exxon produced this publication:
‘‘Global warming: who’s right? Facts
about a debate that’s turned up more
questions than answers.’’ Here, Exxon
paints climate science as uncertain. It
includes a statement by Exxon’s then-
CEO Lee Raymond that the ‘‘scientific
evidence remains inconclusive as to
whether human activities affect global
climate.’’ Raymond didn’t mention the
conclusions of the 1982 report com-
pletely exploding that statement—a re-
port they had then sat on for 14 years.
Directly contrary to Exxon’s 1982 re-
port, Raymond also warned against
what he called ‘‘precipitous, poorly
considered action on climate change,’’
and he claimed that there was ample
time to wait and better understand the
climate system. But the 1982 Exxon re-
port understood it quite perfectly.
Then came this 1998 Exxon publica-
tion: ‘‘Global climate change: every-
one’s debate.’’ It is full of the familiar,
phony climate-denial arguments. In
this publication, Exxon CEO Raymond
writes: ‘‘The current state of climate
science is too uncertain to provide
clear answers to many key questions
about global climate change.’’ Well,
the 1982 report had enough answers for
them to know what to do. Raymond
didn’t mention the 1982 report.
Nineteen ninety-eight was a year
after the Kyoto Protocol. The fossil
fuel industry fought to ensure that the
United States would never ratify that
protocol.
Exxon helped the American Petro-
leum Institute develop a plan they
called the ‘‘Global Climate Science
Communications Action Plan.’’ The
plan was to sow false doubt—doubt
that the 1982 report completely blew
out of the water—about climate
science. The plan said: ‘‘Victory will be
achieved when . . . average citizens
and the media ‘understand’ uncertain-
ties in climate science.’’ It set out a
national media strategy to exaggerate
the uncertainties in climate science,
including a plan to ‘‘identify, recruit,
and train a team of five independent
scientists to participate in media out-
reach.’’ Train a team. It planned to dis-
tribute a ‘‘steady stream of climate
science information’’—for that, read
‘‘misinformation’’—to science writers,
newspapers, and TV journalists around
the country.
If you think Exxon’s false-doubt cam-
paign is a thing of the distant past,
think again. At Exxon Mobil’s 2015—
this decade—shareholder meeting,
Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson was still al-
leging uncertainty, saying that we
‘‘don’t really know what the climate
effects of 600 parts per million versus
450 parts per million will be, because
the models simply are not that good.’’
Tillerson, like Raymond, didn’t men-
tion the 1982 report, which modeled
very well the climate effects. Exxon by
then had sat on the 1982 report for 33
years.
If this all seems somehow familiar to
you, it ought to be because Exxon stole
its false-doubt strategy directly from
the tobacco industry’s science-denial
playbook.
In 1999, the Department of Justice
filed a civil lawsuit against the major
tobacco companies and their associated
industry groups, alleging that the to-
bacco companies had ‘‘engaged in and
executed—and continued to engage in
and execute—a massive 50-year scheme
to defraud the public.’’
In 2006, U.S. district court judge
Gladys Kessler, in a lengthy and au-
thoritative opinion that was upheld on
appeal by the U.S. court of appeals,
found the tobacco companies’ fraudu-
lent campaign to have amounted to
racketeering. In her ruling, she found
that the tobacco industry ‘‘coordinated
significant aspects of their public rela-
tions, scientific, legal, and marketing
activity in furtherance of a shared ob-
jective—to . . . maximize industry
profits by preserving and expanding the
market for cigarettes through a
scheme to deceive the public.’’
Take that sentence and replace the
word ‘‘cigarettes’’ with ‘‘fossil fuel,’’
and Judge Kessler’s finding describes
exactly what Exxon and other compa-
nies did: coordinated significant as-
pects of their public relations, sci-
entific, legal, and marketing activity
in furtherance of a shared objective—to
maximize industry profits by pre-
serving and expanding the market for
fossil fuel through a scheme to deceive
the public.
In the face of increasingly obvious
and overwhelming evidence, Exxon and
the fossil fuel industry have recently
backed away a little bit from their
false-doubt efforts on climate science,
but have they really changed their
stripes, or have they, in their long bat-
tle to prevent meaningful climate ac-
tion, just fallen back to new battle-
ments?
Take carbon pricing. Economists
from across the ideological spectrum
say carbon pricing is the most efficient
and the most effective way to reduce
carbon emissions. In the past year,
Exxon and BP each announced that
they supported carbon pricing and
would give $1 million to Americans for
Carbon Dividends, a group advocating
for carbon pricing. But these donations
are a drop in the bucket compared to
the tens of millions Exxon has given to
political machinery peddling climate
denial and opposing carbon pricing or
compared to the $13 million BP just
spent to defeat Washington State’s car-
bon pricing initiative.
Senator SCHATZ and I have some
firsthand experience because we have
introduced a revenue-neutral carbon
fee bill in the last three Congresses. I
can assure you, Exxon has made no ef-
fort to support it.
Industry support for carbon pricing
seems to mysteriously evaporate in
proximity to an actual carbon pricing
bill.
Science writer and environmentalist
Bill McKibben sums up Exxon’s climate
strategy well. I quote him here:
[T]he world’s largest and most powerful oil
company knew everything there was to know
about climate change by the mid-1980s, and
then spent the next few decades systemati-
cally funding climate denial and lying about
the state of the science.
That is its record. It is responsible
for where we are in Congress. After the
Citizens United decision, it paid to
slaughter bipartisanship in Congress on
climate change with its new Citizens
United political weaponry. It paid a
whole armada of front groups to lie
about climate change, and those front
groups are still out there and are still
lying. The industry is behind the re-
lentless climate antagonism we have
seen from business groups, like the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Na-
tional Association of Manufacturers, as
if clean and renewable energy doesn’t
involve commerce and manufacturing.
It created and funded a vast apparatus
of denial and obstruction, and it has
lied and lied and lied.
There is every reason to believe that
the oil industry, with Exxon at the
lead, remains just as opposed to mean-
ingful climate action today as it has
been for three decades. With its long
history of lying, it is easy to believe
that whatever corporate sinews might
bind Exxon to the truth are long atro-
phied and degraded and that this is just
another chapter in the industry’s great
climate scam—that this is the ‘‘pre-
tend to support a carbon price’’ chapter
of the scam.
Even if somewhere in Exxon’s cor-
porate bowels there were some flicker
of sincerity, it would not be enough for
Exxon to just stop the scam. After all
of the evil Exxon has done, it needs to
undo its evil, not just stop doing evil.
It is not enough to stand next to the
burning house you have lit on fire and
pledge no further arson. Even if you
are sincere about no further arson, it is
still not enough. You need to help step
in and put the fire out. You need to put
your heart and your back into putting
out the fire that you lit.
When you are sincere, Exxon, I will
be in. Let’s solve this. Yet you have a
long record and much to atone for.
Meanwhile, our planet remains on
course for the great, irreversible harm
your own scientists predicted nearly
four decades ago.
It is due to Exxon’s political mischief
that we have yet to wake up in Con-
gress to what Exxon itself predicted 37
years ago.
I yield the floor.

fess that my fascination—or maybe
‘‘obsession’’ is another word to describe
it—with what some people proclaim to
be their newfound belief in socialism is
really a mystery to me. It is something

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3338 June 12, 2019
I have thought and read quite a bit
about just so I could try to understand
what they could possibly be thinking.
A recent poll found that 4 in 10 Amer-
icans say they prefer living in a social-
ist country to a capitalist country—40
percent. For those of us who have wit-
nessed the rise and fall of socialism
over the course of our lives or who
have even read about it in the history
books, that is a major cause for con-
cern. Yet today’s socialists try to dis-
tinguish themselves from those coun-
tries that have actually implemented
socialism—Venezuela, the Soviet
Union, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania,
and other failed socialist nations. They
are saying that they are democratic so-
cialists.
As a matter of fact, one of our Senate
colleagues who is running for Presi-
dent—the junior Senator from
Vermont, not the distinguished Sen-
ator on the floor—is speaking today at
an event in defense of democratic so-
cialism. I have to say, if you ask me,
that is an oxymoron. You can’t support
democracy and socialism at the same
time. Those two ideals are completely
at odds with one another. Yet what we
see happening is people who use labels
to confuse the American people and
who claim to be what they are not—lit-
erally being Trojan horses for ideas
that have been demonstrated to have
failed throughout the world’s history.
Many of these so-called democratic
socialists have gotten into the habit of
suggesting that Scandinavian coun-
tries are successful models for their
ideology. They will point to the eco-
nomic successes of these countries,
combined with their expansive govern-
ment-run programs—free higher edu-
cation, universal healthcare, subsidized
childcare. They will say: ‘‘Look, it
works.’’ Robust welfare programs are
not the cornerstones of socialism, al-
though many seem to think that this is
the case.
The poll I mentioned earlier found
that there is a broad disagreement
about what exactly constitutes social-
ism. To me, one of the most interesting
findings of some of the polling is when
you ask some people what ‘‘socialism’’
is, they say, ‘‘Well, that is being so-
cial.’’ They also say, ‘‘Well, it is uni-
versal healthcare, tuition-free edu-
cation, and a living wage.’’ Only two-
thirds of the people say it involves a
state-controlled economy, and fewer
still believe socialism involves the
state control and the regulation of pri-
vate property, the media, and commu-
nications.
Let me be clear. The most funda-
mental aspect of socialism isn’t the so-
cial benefits it provides; it is having
the government in control. It is the
surrendering of your individual free-
dom and choices to government coer-
cion and brute force. That is the only
way people can be forced into limiting
their freedom, their activity, and their
incomes is by brute government force.
That is the single most important, dis-
tinguishing feature of socialism.
So those who claim that these Scan-
dinavian countries with social security
programs are shining examples of so-
cialism could not be more wrong. These
countries largely operate free markets,
and they are the first to correct us and
say they are not socialists. Neverthe-
less, so-called democratic socialists
continue to name these countries as
successful examples because the only
true examples of socialism don’t poll
quite nearly as high. The prime exam-
ple is Venezuela.
Venezuela’s troubled story began in
the late nineties when then-Presi-
dential candidate Hugo Chavez deliv-
ered an impassioned speech that prom-
ised to lead Venezuela into a socialist
paradise. He talked about the country’s
wealth being stolen by evil capitalists
and greedy corporations, and he prom-
ised hope and change if he were elected.
That sounds pretty similar to what we
hear from the so-called democratic so-
cialists today.
For any Americans who wonder if
that hope and change being promised
by these candidates might actually
work, let me reassure you that there
would be a lot of change but that it
would not be the type of change you
would want. Again, look at Venezuela.
The government took over businesses,
shut down free markets, and sup-
pressed free speech. As a result, one of
the richest countries in the world is
now among the poorest. Basic commod-
ities like food, medicine, and water are
in short supply. About 6 months ago, I
myself was at the border between Co-
lombia and Venezuela, and I witnessed
Venezuelans going across the border
into Colombia in order to pick up some
of the basics of life—medicine, food,
and the like.
Of course, with regard to freedom of
the press, well, you can throw that out
the window in Venezuela, and, of
course, crime rates have skyrocketed.
That is why you don’t see caravans of
people attempting to immigrate to
countries like Venezuela—it is just the
opposite. The United Nations an-
nounced last week that more than 4
million people have escaped Ven-
ezuela—4 million refugees from Ven-
ezuela—and that a quarter of those
have left in the last 7 months. The UN
Refugee Agency referred to this mass
exodus as the ‘‘largest in the recent
history of Latin America and the Car-
ibbean.’’
That is what happens under social-
ism. Citizens flee poverty, government
control, and corruption in search of op-
portunities to build better lives for
themselves. The trouble is, no matter
what word you put in front of the word
‘‘socialism,’’ it doesn’t really matter
because it is still socialism.
I think Winston Churchill summed it
up best, as he frequently did, when he
said:
The inherent vice of capitalism is the un-
equal sharing of blessings. The inherent vir-
tue of Socialism is the equal sharing of mis-
eries.
I can assure you that if these demo-
cratic socialists get their way, there
will be no shortage of miseries to
share.
I urge all of our colleagues and all
Americans to learn, to share the les-
sons of history, and to remind our fel-
low citizens that so-called democratic
socialism is nothing more than a Tro-
jan horse that would destroy our coun-
try and destroy our way of life. Most
fundamentally of all, it would destroy
the American dream.
We can look around America and find
good examples, but, of course, I am
partial to the example of the State of
Texas as to how free market ideals and
less government can produce more
prosperity, more freedom, and a better
quality of life. Yet, if our Democratic
friends—particularly those who are
running for President—get their way
with Medicare for All, the Green New
Deal, and a host of other disastrous
policies, the sort of prosperity and op-
portunity and freedom of choice that
you see now in places like Texas will be
out the window.
When our friend the minority leader,
the Senator from New York, calls the
Senate a legislative graveyard, in one
respect, he is entirely right, because we
are going to do everything we can to
make sure the U.S. Senate is a firewall
against these disastrous socialist poli-
cies.
ELECTION SECURITY
Mr. President, on another matter,
there has been a lot of discussion since
the election of 2016 about election secu-
rity, and correctly so. With the first
primary of the 2020 election being only
8 months away, there could not be a
more critical time to discuss the work
that has been done since 2016 to secure
our Nation’s election infrastructure.
There has been a lot of focus over the
last 21⁄2 years on what exactly did and
did not happen in 2016. We know there
was a lot of meddling by Russian state
actors who tried to sow discord and
confusion and pit American against
American through the use of social
media and propaganda. There is one
piece of information that has remained
perfectly clear—and it is of some com-
fort to me—which is that no votes were
actually changed or altered, but we
can’t assume this will be the case in
the future. What we did see was a con-
certed effort by the Russian Govern-
ment to infiltrate our systems and sow
division and discord among Americans,
as the Presiding Officer knows, which
was the conclusion reached by the in-
telligence community assessment in
January of 2017, which was supported
by the Senate Intelligence Commit-
tee’s unclassified summary of that as-
sessment last summer, and which was
again reiterated in Special Counsel
Robert Mueller’s recent report.
I don’t want to mince words on this
point. Any attempt, successful or un-
successful, to interfere with our elec-
tions is unacceptable and would se-
verely undermine our self-government
and our Democratic values.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3339
June 12, 2019
Across the Federal Government,
there was an immediate effort to pre-
vent what happened in 2016 from re-
peating itself in 2018. The Intelligence
Committee began investigating meas-
ures taken by the Russian Government
in 2016 to find out, one, what happened,
and, two, how we can prevent that from
happening in the future.
While there was evidence of contin-
ued disinformation campaigns, the In-
telligence Community found that 2018
was largely interference-free. Again,
we can’t assume that will be the case
going forward, but 2018, thankfully,
was largely interference-free. That was
the conclusion of the FBI Director,
Chris Wray, but he called 2018 ‘‘a dress
rehearsal for the big show,’’ and that is
the 2020 Presidential election.
We have to continue to work to
strengthen our efforts to protect our
elections, and I believe we are already
doing some good work in the Senate to
accomplish exactly that. Just last
week we passed the Defending Elec-
tions against Trolls from Enemy Re-
gimes Act, or the DETER Act. This
legislation was introduced by our col-
leagues Senator GRAHAM and Senator
DURBIN, and it sends an important mes-
sage to foreign governments that at-
tempts to meddle in our elections will
not be tolerated.
That legislation makes individuals
who have done that—who have at-
tempted to interfere in our elections—
categorically inadmissible to the
United States.
It passed by unanimous consent here
in the Senate, meaning not a single
Senator voted against it.
In addition, I hope we will soon vote
on the Defending the Integrity of Vot-
ing Systems Act, which was introduced
by Senators GRAHAM, WHITEHOUSE, and
BLUMENTHAL. This legislation amends
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to
make it easier to federally prosecute
individuals who engage in election in-
terference. It is an important way to
protect voting machines and fight back
against those who seek to undermine
our democratic processes. I hope these
bills and others like them can quickly
work their way through Congress so we
can get them to the President’s desk
ahead of the 2020 election.
What we tonight want to do is to cen-
tralize our system of local and State-
run elections here in Washington, DC.
Actually, one thing we learned is that
the decentralization of our voting proc-
ess locally and in the States has been
one of the most significant protections
against interference in our elections.
But, of course, in addition to our legis-
lative efforts, we have approved hun-
dreds of millions of dollars in funding
to help States prevent future election
interference.
When the American people cast their
ballot in 2020, they should be able to do
so with confidence, and that is pre-
cisely what we are working to provide.
We will continue our work to ensure
that State, Federal, and local election
officials have the tools and resources
they need to safeguard our efforts and
to prevent foreign governments from
meddling in our democratic processes.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont.
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have
had many discussions on what is hap-
pening on appropriations bills. So I
thought I could help clear some things
up.
Next week, the Senate Appropria-
tions Committee will mark up a sup-
plemental appropriations bill. We are
doing this to address the humanitarian
crisis, which it is, on our southern bor-
der. There is absolutely no need for
this to be a partisan process. So many
of us, Republicans and Democrats,
agree we need to address the humani-
tarian crisis on our southern border.
We have seen the news reports show-
ing crowded conditions at Custom and
Border Protection facilities. We have
seen the pictures of women and chil-
dren sleeping outside on the ground be-
cause the facilities are full. I have gone
through places where they basically
have cages holding children—and this
is happening in America. And we have
seen the numbers of unaccompanied
children in our care swell as kids come
across the border looking for help and
compassion.
Now, most of these people are fleeing
violence or dire poverty in their home
countries. Most know how dangerous
the trek north will be, but they feel
they have no choice but to make the
trek anyway. Some have said they
know they may die on the trek north,
but they are going to die from gang vi-
olence and the murderers back home if
they do not. They fear for their lives.
By the time they reach us, they are
exhausted, they are scared, and they
are hungry. The vast majority actually
just turn themselves over to Border
Patrol Agents as soon as they cross
into the United States. Rather than try
to evade law enforcement, they look
for the U.S. authorities in uniform.
They turn themselves in to them and
are then escorted by Border Patrol
through the billion-dollar, actually
useless, Trump wall. They are not
looking to do us harm. They are look-
ing for mercy.
Now, we may disagree about what
has led to this crisis and what changes
may be needed to our immigration sys-
tem. But I take issue with claims from
across the aisle that Democrats oppose
any and all solutions to address this
crisis. Everybody knows that is simply
false.
We have a responsibility to make
sure that the people in our care are
treated humanely. After all, we are
Americans. We ought to show the
world we stand for American values. As
vice chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, I take this responsibility
seriously.
The Department of Health and
Human Services Office of Refugee Re-
settlement—the Agency that cares for
unaccompanied children who cross the
border—is running out of money. They
are expected to exceed their Federal
appropriations by the end of this
month. Because they are running out
of money, they have already begun to
scale back on services that are not
critical for life and safety, including
education, recreation, and legal serv-
ices. We ought to take action. Customs
and Border Protection processing fa-
cilities are vastly over capacity. That
not only creates dangerous conditions
for the migrants who are in our care
but also dangerous conditions for our
Border Patrol staff.
We have seen these pictures of men
and women and children sleeping out-
side with Mylar blankets in temporary
shelters, under bridges, and in over-
crowded conditions inside facilities
that cannot accommodate them. I have
seen this. It cannot continue. We have
to do better. We Americans have Amer-
ican values. We should act like it.
The Senate Democrats are willing to
provide money to address these prob-
lems. We have a responsibility to do
so—Republicans and Democrats both—
but we also have a responsibility to put
basic conditions on this money. We
want to make sure the taxpayers’ dol-
lars are appropriately spent. We cannot
provide a blank check, especially to
this administration.
HHS and DHS facilities have to meet
appropriate standards. So the care we
provide reflects the fact that we are
Americans with American values. We
must not let detainees languish out-
doors in 100-degree temperatures for
more than 30 days without showering
or changing clothes—and that is hap-
pening.
Children in our care should only be
housed in facilities that meet State li-
censing requirements—not in cages.
They should have access to education,
recreation, and legal services. DHS
should not be using information on po-
tential sponsors for unaccompanied
children to deport them. We found that
has happened. We had people willing
and capable of taking care of these
children instead of the U.S. taxpayers
spending thousands upon thousands of
dollars. Instead of saying thank you,
we say: Well, we are going to check
your background. Maybe we should de-
port you.
It makes me think about the number
of people who have served in our mili-
tary and overseas that are immigrants
and then get deported. Now, that is
hard to understand. It is probably easi-
er to understand for people who have
refused to serve, but it is hard to un-
derstand.
That is no different than saying: Oh,
you served our country, you faced dan-
gers, and you were shot at wearing the
uniform of this country. But we are
throwing you out.
Now, Members of Congress with over-
sight responsibility of these Agencies
should be able to have access to deten-
tion facilities. The Trump administra-
tion should not request these resources

from Congress and then not tell Con-
gress what they are going to do with it
by saying: We sure as heck are not
going to let any Member of Congress—
Republican or Democrat—see what we
do with it.
Money appropriated for humani-
tarian assistance should be used for hu-
manitarian assistance. It should not be
diverted to pay for a wall, which would
do nothing to solve this humanitarian
crisis.
Now, these should not be controver-
sial propositions. They are reasonable
conditions to include. They should get
bipartisan support. We can do it if Re-
publicans want to, but what we are not
going to do is allow the Trump admin-
istration to use this humanitarian cri-
sis to supplement funding for an en-
forcement agenda that is not only con-
troversial but also ineffective and
cruel.
For example, the President has asked
for funding to increase ICE detention
facilities by 7,600 beds. There is no need
for this increased funding. We should
not provide it.
The administration’s inclination at
every turn is to just use detention to
solve our immigration problem, while
not actually working to solve our im-
migration problem, at enormous cost
to the American taxpayers. It is expen-
sive, inefficient, and it is wrong. The
other thing is that it does not work.
Alternatives to detention exist. They
are safe, effective, and enormously less
expensive to the taxpayers.
The administration needs to use the
resources it has for ICE detention serv-
ices to house those people who truly
present a danger to our communities.
Yes, house somebody who is a criminal.
House somebody who has a criminal
record. But do not lock up every man,
woman, and child simply for being here
without proper documentation, spend-
ing thousands upon thousands of tax-
payer dollars to lock up a 5-year-old.
They are really not the people we
should worry about. But the Trump ad-
ministration’s dramatically escalating
the arrest and detention of immigrants
who have no criminal record makes no
sense. It is an enormous waste of tax-
payers’ dollars.
We carefully negotiated ICE bed lev-
els in the fiscal year 2019 Homeland Se-
curity appropriations bill just a few
months ago, which got strong bipar-
tisan support. That was just a few
months ago; there is no reason to re-
visit it now just a few months later.
Congress should also ensure that
funding it approved 2 years ago—over-
whelmingly, by both Republicans and
Democrats—to deal with the root
causes of immigration from Central
America is spent for those purposes. If
we do not deal with the reasons people
are leaving their countries, of course
they are going to keep coming. That is
just common sense, and that is why we
appropriated these funds. That is why
Republicans and Democrats voted to
appropriate these funds and the Presi-
dent signed those appropriations bills.
We should insist they are used for the
purposes that Republicans and Demo-
crats voted for them to be used.
When President Trump decides to
withhold a half a billion dollars of that
funding, that is self-defeating. That
does about as much to stop illegal im-
migration as tweeting about it does.
So in addition to being ready, will-
ing, and able to help address humani-
tarian issues at the border, Democrats
are also advocating for longer term so-
lutions that both parties should sup-
port if we are serious about solving
this crisis.
As some Senators recall, when I was
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, we had months of hearings,
weeks of markup, hundreds of pieces of
information coming, and witnesses,
and I brought a comprehensive immi-
gration bill to the floor 6 years ago.
There were 68 Senators, Republicans
and Democrats alike, who voted for it.
Even though it passed the Senate, the
Republican Speaker of the House re-
fused to bring it up.
The irony is that yesterday the Act-
ing Homeland Security Secretary testi-
fied that if we had enacted that bill—
the bill I brought to this floor, which 68
Senators voted for—it would have
made a difference in the current crisis.
It is unfortunate that the Republican
Speaker blocked it.
He did say it would violate the Den-
nis Hastert rule, and they had to up-
hold that. Well, no, it violated common
sense by not bringing it to a vote.
So as we did back then, any immigra-
tion reform we consider today has to be
done on a bipartisan basis. That is how
we got the big vote here. I know that
these are controversial matters. Of
course they are. That is why we strug-
gle over them. But bipartisanship is
the only way to get things done around
here.
Given the urgency of the need on the
southern border, I hope my Republican
colleagues will not use this bill as a ve-
hicle to force debate on divisive immi-
gration proposals that should be left to
the authorizing committees, not to the
Appropriations Committee. If we turn
this into a protracted debate about im-
migration reform, we will only delay
much needed humanitarian assistance
on the southern border.
We could do both. Pass the appropria-
tions bills, but then let’s have a real
debate, as we did a few years ago, on
immigration reform, something that
got two-thirds of the Senate—Repub-
licans and Democrats—to vote for it.
As I said at the beginning, consider-
ation of a supplemental appropriations
bill to address the humanitarian crisis
should never be a partisan issue. We all
want to make sure that we appro-
priately care for the vulnerable fami-
lies seeking refuge at the United States
of America’s border.
I urge all Members to focus on areas
of agreement in this package. There
are a lot of areas we can agree on, Re-
publicans and Democrats. Focus on it,
pass it, and get assistance out the door
as quickly as possible.
I see another Senator is waiting.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee.
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President,
thank you for the recognition and op-
portunity to speak with my colleagues
about an issue that I think is so incred-
ibly important.
We just heard the Senator from
Vermont discuss the issue at the south-
ern border. I made a return trip—one of
many I have made to the southern bor-
der over the past decade—this past Fri-
day. I have to tell you, I thought this
situation was just a terrible situation a
decade ago. As I have continued to
visit and work on issues that deal with
illegal immigration, illegal aliens,
working on immigration reform over
the past decade, many times with great
frustration because we cannot achieve
bipartisan agreement, I saw a situation
on the southern border this trip that
was far worse than I ever could have
imagined.
In the middle of all of this are some
very brave Border Patrol agents, ICE
agents, DHS agents, Coast Guard that
are there providing healthcare—they
are carrying out their job every single
day. I am grateful to them for their
service. I am so impressed by their re-
solve to protect this Nation—to protect
it.
There is a lesson we could learn from
these Border Patrol agents. As they go
out, underfunded, disrespected, not
knowing what they are going to en-
counter, there is a lesson that every
single American could learn. These
men and women are dedicated. They
show up. They do their job. They
value—they value—citizenship in this
country. They value this Nation’s sov-
ereignty. And one of the things they
know is that citizenship—citizenship—
is something the American people
should hold very dear. It should not
come to somebody illegally approach-
ing our country. It should not come to
somebody who is coming here to do us
harm.
I will tell you this: To enter one of
those reception centers or retention
centers in the El Paso sector—which is
there in Southwest Texas and right on
the New Mexico-Mexico border—is to
enter an area where you can just feel
the chaos and the uncertainty. It per-
meates the air.
People know this is difficult. The
American people should know this is
very difficult. It is a terrible situation
that our men and women of the Border
Patrol are dealing with—to see young
mothers alone with their babies, wait-
ing for answers from a Federal agency
about where they are going to go or
what is going to happen to them be-
cause somebody in Central America
lied to them—a cartel lied to them,
misrepresented to them what they
were going to see.
I heard from a Border Patrol agent
that there are adults who are saying:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3341
June 12, 2019
Well, this is not what we were prom-
ised. This isn’t what we were expect-
ing. Maybe we should just go back
home. They were lied to.
This is why we need to get busy with
changing the asylum laws, the magnet
that is pulling people here. Change
this. It is why I applaud the efforts of
the President for making certain that
we are dealing with Mexico—having
them secure their southern border,
having them call out the National
Guard to make certain these cartels
are not able to operate in Mexico.
Our Border Patrol—as I said, I am
just so grateful we have them, and
without Americans knowing, they are
blessing our lives every single day be-
cause they show up and do the job that
is in front of them without proper re-
sources because there has not been bi-
partisan agreement here.
Then, every day they go home, and
they have encountered people who have
measles, mumps, H1N1 flu, TB, scabies,
lice. That is what they are exposed to
every single day as they do their job.
Healthcare is not their job. Securing
the southern border is their job, and
everybody who is against giving the
Border Patrol what they need to secure
that border needs to begin to think
twice about that and have compassion
for these men and women who are on
the frontline.
The appalling conditions absolutely
shock the conscience, but they didn’t
surprise me. This is what is happening
because people think they can get by
with coming here illegally. Last
month, 144,000 migrants crossed the
border—last month. In Tennessee, that
is just under the size of Clarksville,
TN. Think about a whole city coming
in.
In the first 8 months of this fiscal
year, 411,000 unaccompanied children
and families made that same journey.
This past weekend, when I was out
with the Border Patrol, 12 people in 3
groups were apprehended right in front
of me. That was in the timespan of 30
minutes. There were four from Hon-
duras, and eight were from Cuba. That
is just a handful of the approximately
1,000 illegal aliens per day who are ap-
prehended in the El Paso sector.
Ninety percent of those people come
as family units, clogging a system de-
signed to process adults traveling
alone. The sheer number of people our
agents are struggling to process and
control is staggering.
Right now, the facilities at the El
Paso border station house are taking in
1,247 illegal aliens. That facility is
built to accommodate 123. At just one
station in the El Paso sector, $26,000 a
day is spent on food, just food—food.
Where are they getting this money? It
has not been appropriated. They are
taking it out of their operations budg-
ets. This is why they need us to surge
resources to the southern border—re-
sources for more agents, resources for
more technology, resources for a bor-
der wall to stop illegal entry into this
country.
If it were just a question of numbers,
the situation may seem more manage-
able. But as I mentioned, disease,
drugs, and a frightening disregard for
the law have transformed these border
stations into refugee zones.
Right now, agents at camps are
working overtime every single day,
trying to keep up. Loopholes in regula-
tions controlling the release of unac-
companied minors to purported
custodians are endangering the 11,507
children who crossed the southern bor-
der in May of 2019.
I want to be certain everybody under-
stands this: 11,507 is the number of
children who crossed that southern
border in the month of May.
To make things worse, we are seeing
child predators and traffickers cross
the border in increasing numbers. Girls
as young as 10 years of age are being
given pregnancy tests—10-year-olds—
because traffickers or adults who are
not family members are the ones who
are bringing them in. This is an area
where my colleagues across the aisle
need to work with us and put a stop to
this. We don’t know if these children
are going to smuggling rings, or sex
rings and being sent to a pimp, or to
labor gangs and being sent to a boss.
We don’t know because many of the
people who are the so-called custodians
who are accepting these children, who
are their sponsors, guess what, they are
in the country illegally.
On June 7, border agents seized
enough fentanyl to kill nearly 2 mil-
lion Americans. I was there in that
port when they seized 5 kilos, but the
drug lords and the cartels are
undeterred. They are so bold in this; do
you know what they are doing now?
They are posting Facebook ads solic-
iting mules to run their deadly product
across the border. We have to do bet-
ter. This is something that should no
longer be up for debate.
I sponsored the Accountability for
Care of Unaccompanied Alien Children
Act to codify information-sharing
agreements between the Department of
Homeland Security and the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services.
This would help protect minors from
the ravages of exploitation and human
trafficking, but that protection isn’t
possible if there are not going to be
agents able and available to check on
who is attempting to claim these chil-
dren.
I know some of my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle are not for these
agencies sharing this information, but
let me tell you something. If this is
going to help keep children safe, if it is
going to keep them out of these sex
trafficking and human trafficking
gangs, we need to know who is a crimi-
nal alien, who is in this country ille-
gally, and these children do not need to
be sent to them.
We know the White House in May
sent an emergency request for $4.5 bil-
lion in funds to increase shelter capac-
ity at the processing centers, to feed
and care for the detained migrants, to
hire agents and staff, and to bolster
law enforcement’s ability to shelter
and protect unaccompanied minors.
Our border agents need this money to
protect our border and to protect our
Nation’s sovereignty.
Yesterday, before the Senate Judici-
ary Committee, acting DHS Secretary
Kevin McAleenan expressed serious
concerns for Border Patrol agents who
are forced to play the part of a trans-
lator, caregiver, counselor, and nurse.
Let me ask a question. What do my
colleagues think would happen if the
Border Patrol decided they had had it?
They had had it. They were tired of it,
and they were not going to show up for
work, to work overtime, to work hard
hours, to do a job they are not trained
to do. They are trained to protect the
border; they are not trained to be a
caregiver and a nurse. What would hap-
pen if they reached the breaking point,
and they didn’t show up—because, let
me tell you something, this border has
reached a breaking point.
It is time for us to realize, yes, there
is a crisis. It is a humanitarian crisis;
it is a national security crisis, and it is
time that our Border Patrol be shown
the respect—the respect they deserve
by funding the needs that they have to
protect each and every one of us and to
help keep this Nation safe and secure.
I yield the floor.

YEAR-ROUND SALE OF E15
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, yes-
terday I had the privilege of joining
President Trump in Nebraska and Iowa
for the official announcement of the
year-round sale of E15. The announce-
ment is the product of years of work
across party lines to fight for the hard-
working agriculture producers in Ne-
braska.
If you ask any family who lives in
rural America, they will tell you how
important fuel prices are in their lives.
With longer-than-average daily com-
mutes to work or to drop off their chil-
dren at school, escalating gas prices
make life more difficult for everyone.
A needless barrier has restricted con-
sumers from filling up their vehicles
with E15 fuel during some of the busi-
est months of the year—the summer
driving season. Each year, from the be-
ginning of June to mid-September, re-
tailers were unable to offer fuels with
higher blends of ethanol without a Fed-
eral Government-issued waiver. This
means that renewable solutions to
reach our Nation’s vital fuel needs
have been needlessly anchored to an
older era. The ban on the year-round
sale of E15 has robbed Americans of an
opportunity to save money at the
pump with the purchase of a cleaner
fuel.
Nebraska stands proudly as the larg-
est producer of biofuel west of the Mis-
souri River. We are home to 25 ethanol
plants, which produce a total of more
than 2 billion gallons of renewable fuel
each year. According to the Nebraska

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3342 June 12, 2019
Ethanol Board, our ethanol plants pro-
vide over 1,300 good-paying jobs to Ne-
braskans, and this creates a $5 billion
impact on our State. As I have said be-
fore, for Nebraska and much of the
heartland, restricting the year-round
sale of E15 was equivalent to benching
our best player during the most impor-
tant game of the season.
For years, I have been fighting to put
an end to this unnecessary ban that
has restricted our farmers, retailers,
and consumers for far too long. In 2017,
I introduced the Consumer and Fuel
Retailer Choice Act, with the senior
Senator from Iowa, to put an end to
this decades-old regulation. The bill
sought to extend the Reid vapor pres-
sure waiver to ethanol blends above 10
percent.
At the same time, I began holding
very productive discussions with Presi-
dent Trump on the importance of E15
to the people of Nebraska but also to
the people of rural America. The Presi-
dent agreed that this commonsense so-
lution was needed. Last year, I was
very proud to join him at the White
House as he directed the EPA to allow
for the year-round sale of E15.
Yesterday we turned a new page as
President Trump’s directive officially
became a reality for farmers and eth-
anol producers. It was great to accom-
pany the President, Secretary of Agri-
culture Sonny Perdue, and EPA Ad-
ministrator Andrew Wheeler to deliver
this encouraging news.
We landed at Offutt Air Force Base in
Nebraska and headed to the SIRE eth-
anol plant in Council Bluffs, IA. There,
we heard President Trump give a
speech highlighting the essential role
of our farmers, ranchers, and the eth-
anol industry. We also heard from a
few Nebraskans on how this is impact-
ing them.
The first speaker was Kevin Ross. He
is from Iowa. He is a sixth-generation
farmer, and he is vice president of the
National Corn Growers Association. He
said:
I work in the greatest industry we have in
this country, and that’s agriculture. We are
blessed by God to have the science that has
let us achieve new heights in production.
Whether that’s yield of corn, the efficiency
of this ethanol plant, or gains in my cattle,
agriculture continues to do more with less.
. . . The economic benefits and the clean air
delivered through biofuels are wins for the
seventh generation on my family farm and
wins for all U.S. citizens.
Another guest speaker was Randy
Gard. He is the chief operating officer
of Bosselman Pump & Pantry and
Bosselman Enterprises, located in my
State of Nebraska at Grand Island. He
said:
Today is a great day for the American
farmer, the ethanol industry, fuel retailers,
and the American consumer.
After consulting with their cus-
tomers, this company started offering
E15 fuel a few years ago. Mr. Gard con-
tinued:
We started to install the infrastructure,
started to put all the marketing information
behind it, and we came up with something
fairly simple but compelling. We said E15 is
simply better fuel and it costs less. . . . It
was easy for our employees at our stores to
articulate, easy for our customers to under-
stand, and it must have worked because in
2017, our sales of E15 increased over 300 per-
cent. In 2018, they went up another 225 per-
cent. And with the help of President Trump
opening the door for year-round E15, our
newest projections for this year show an in-
crease of another 400 percent.
Hearing the confidence of Nebraskans
is encouraging, and this is why I have
been determined to make the year-
round sale of E15 a reality for them.
The nets that have constricted inno-
vation and market expansion in rural
America for far too long have now been
cut, and the news couldn’t come at a
better time for our farmers and for our
rural communities.
Last March brought unimaginable
setbacks due to the historic flooding
that ravaged through Nebraska and
large regions of the Midwest. On top of
higher input costs, tighter margins,
and decreased commodity prices, these
factors have created anxiety for our
farm families. The lift of the year-
round ban on E15 gives ag producers
some much needed certainty during
these very difficult times.
America’s consumers and retailers
will also reap the benefits. They will no
longer face confusion at the pump, as
E15 will be labeled consistently, re-
gardless of the season. With more com-
petition in place, consumers can make
the best fuel decision for their families
and for their wallets. Retailers will no
longer need to make those unneces-
sary, expensive adjustments to their
infrastructure every year to accommo-
date for this regulation.
The year-round sale of E15 implemen-
tation comes on the heels of more
great news. EPA Administrator Wheel-
er recently announced that he signed a
final rule which will implement legisla-
tion that I was proud to champion, the
Fair Agricultural Reporting Method
Act, also known as the FARM Act.
This bipartisan legislation protects
farmers, ranchers, and livestock mar-
kets from misguided, burdensome EPA
reporting requirements. Due to regula-
tions that were originally meant to ad-
dress industrial pollution, chemical
plant explosions, and the release of
toxic materials into the environment,
farmers faced uncertainty about re-
porting animal waste emissions on
farms and ranches and other oper-
ations.
These reporting regulations were not
intended to affect livestock or animal
agriculture. Yet our agriculture indus-
try worried about this unnecessary
burden for years. I have heard time and
again directly from Nebraska’s farmers
and ranchers on how these regulations
were cause for concern.
The FARM Act implementation de-
livers a permanent fix to this issue by
providing ag producers with exemp-
tions to animal waste reporting re-
quirements.
In closing, I want to thank the bipar-
tisan group of my Senate colleagues
whose years of determined efforts
paved the way for the fruition of these
important measures, and I want to
offer my sincere thanks to President
Trump for following through on his
commitment to rural America.
I look forward to seeing the positive
results that these commonsense, bipar-
tisan measures will bring to hard-
working men and women in the good
life and throughout America’s heart-
land. I am proud to fight on behalf of
Nebraska’s farmers, ranchers, and ag
producers, who continue to fuel and
feed the world.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.

BLACKBURN). The Senator from Mis-

BORDER SECURITY
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I
want to talk a little bit about the bor-
der—not the important need to secure
the border, which I am for, but I want
to talk about the humanitarian crisis
we have seen occurring at the border.
Frankly, the Senate and the House—
the Congress—have been watching that
occur for too long.
It has been several weeks now since
the administration notified Congress
that the money that was allocated for
what would have been a traditional set
of challenges at the border is about to
be spent and that there is no money
left for some of these issues we have to
deal with at the border in a particular
way.
We have seen the flood of people ap-
proaching the border to be not only in-
credibly different in numbers but in-
credibly different in context. Probably
20 years ago, 90 percent of the people
who came across the border were com-
ing directly from Mexico.
By the way, when that happened, the
law was changed so that if they came
across from Mexico, you could send
them right back to Mexico. Hopefully,
our neighbors in Mexico are working
with us to still have some potential to
do that with people who come across
the border and come through Mexico—
not necessarily Mexican in their na-
tionality but come through Mexico to
the border—to go back and wait for
what needs to happen for their case to
be heard in Mexico rather than here.
Most of the people coming today are
coming from Central America—Guate-
mala, El Salvador, and Honduras. In
the last year, I think the principal
place that has people coming to our
southern border—over 1 percent of the
population of all three of those coun-
tries has come from those countries
collectively.
Clearly it is a problem, but it is espe-
cially troubling to look at the numbers
of children who are coming to the bor-
der unaccompanied. Just last month,
about 130,000 people came to the bor-
der. You can multiply that by 12 pretty
quickly and see 1 million people or
more coming to our border to come in
without the right kinds of documents.
Another million, by the way, come into

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3343
June 12, 2019
our country through the normal proc-
ess. We have about 1 million immi-
grants a year who legally immigrate to
the United States. We are not a coun-
try that does not want people from
other countries to come here; we just
want them to come here based on the
law and the requirements for every-
body else who would like to come to
the United States.
Of that 130,000 people who came in
May, 11,507 of them were children with-
out families. It is really important for
us to understand as we discuss this
that we are not talking about children
who came with their families and were
separated from their families once they
got here. There are plenty of those
children coming right now with fami-
lies because it is pretty clear that say-
ing you want asylum and saying you
have children with you and your family
is one of the things that check a couple
of boxes that more likely will have you
in the United States waiting for your
case to be heard sooner rather than
later. But these are 11,507 children who
came by themselves. About 30 percent
of them are under 12, and about 70 per-
cent of them are between 12 and 18.
You have 11,000 children coming a
month. We think in the calendar year,
that will be about 88,000 children—not
in the calendar year but in the fiscal
year, the spending year, the year that
started October 1. We already believe
that number is going to approach
88,000.
Usually, within 72 hours of those
children showing up at the border by
themselves, the Department of Home-
land Security transfers them to the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices, which is much better positioned
to take care of them than they other-
wise would be. The Department of
Health and Human Services enters into
agreements with Lutheran charities,
Catholic charities, and other groups—
almost always not-for-profit—that
would provide shelter on a clearly un-
derstood basis. This is something
where HHS knows the kinds of housing
these children are going into, provides
shelter, provides medical care, and pro-
vides other services, such as education,
that are provided by these groups that
contract with us. As part of their goal,
they also make an effort to find a safe
and appropriate place as soon as pos-
sible for these kids to be with relatives
who are already in the country or an
alternative that would be appropriate.
Of the 14,000 or so spaces that we
have—beds is one way to look at this,
places to sleep—people are going into
and out of those as soon as we can find
somewhere safe for them to go. So,
ideally, children would stay a very
short time in one of these facilities
while the Department of Health and
Human Services, working with that se-
curity provider—security for the chil-
dren—finds a sponsor. Again, it is usu-
ally a family member. But other people
stay a long time.
The older teenagers tend to be harder
to place, frankly. For some of the Cen-
tral American countries, they don’t
have the family connections that im-
migrants at the border have had in the
past, so there is no family to put them
with. Some of these older teenagers
wind up staying longer than they
would want to or that we would hope
that they would have to, but it is just
the way it is.
Of those 11,507 kids who came to the
border in the month of May, a few of
them may have been in the facility for
less than a day. Some of them may
still be in the facility they went to be-
cause there is nowhere safer than that
for them to go right now.
The problem is that Health and
Human Services is running out of
space, and they are also running out of
money. In April, Secretary Azar, the
head of Health and Human Services,
came to Congress and said: I just want
to give you a warning. We are going to
be out of money on this current pace
by sometime in June.
By the way, we are now in June, and
Congress has not stepped up and done
what is necessary to take care of these
kids.
Let’s think about all the alternatives
that can happen. One of the alter-
natives is you just provide less assist-
ance. Maybe the education goes first
and the recreation time goes second,
and you wait longer to get into the
transitional space that we would want
you to be in, and you are waiting more
than 72 hours.
The other alternative is totally unac-
ceptable, which would be what you
would do with people who are over 18.
You say: OK, if you are 18 or 28 or 38,
we will hear your case at some future
time. We are going to release you into
the United States, and you come back
at a future time, and we will hear
whether there is merit. We will decide
your case at that time.
Well, you can’t release a 12-, 13-, or
14-year-old boy or girl into the United
States and hope that is going to be a
good thing for them to have happen to
them. With the inadequate funding,
they stay in facilities with the Border
Patrol longer than anybody would
want them to.
As I said, the administration esti-
mates that by the end of September—
that would be the end of our spending
year, the one we have allocated money
for—there will be about 88,000 kids who
have come across the border by them-
selves, and the American people would
want you to take care of them until
you can find a safe place for them to
be. No thinking American would say:
Well, just let them go back across the
border by themselves. Let them out in
the United States and see what hap-
pens to them. Nobody would think
that.
That is 88,000. The previous high was
59,000 in 2016. It looks like already we
are probably just about to get to that
number right now. With the time be-
tween now and September 30 left in the
spending year, we have already had
more kids come than we had in the pre-
vious high year.
Congress, which appropriated money
for what we thought would probably be
no more than 59,000 kids during the
course of the year, didn’t appropriate
enough money. So we knew we might
not appropriate enough money, so we
had a transfer authority, where you
could take some money—up to a cer-
tain amount—from other accounts, and
you could transfer that into the ac-
count to take care of more kids than
we would have thought. That money is
gone too.
The Department is being forced to
cut back on some of the things they
have tried to provide for children who
have come into our care through cer-
tainly no fault of ours and maybe not
much fault of theirs—redirecting
money from programs like refugee pro-
grams that are designed to help people
who come truly as refugees. That
money is now being used for unaccom-
panied children.
Remember, Health and Human Serv-
ices is legally required to take care of
these children but is also legally re-
quired not to spend money they don’t
have. If Congress doesn’t act quickly—
and we intend to act on this bill within
a week—HHS, the Department of
Health and Human Services, will have
to tell the grantees—these normally
not-for-profit organizations—well, if
you just keep taking care of these kids,
at some point we will give you the
money we had agreed to give you to
take care of these kids. But between
now and then, you spend the money
and hope you will be reimbursed. It is
kind of like a government shutdown,
except just for this one group of peo-
ple—unaccompanied children. It is a
government shutdown. There is going
to be no money available. These crit-
ical services—you go to the outside
groups that have been willing to step
forward and provide shelter, and you
say: Just keep providing the shelter,
and we will pay you if we can. Some of
these groups may have all kinds of
money and be able to afford to do that.
My guess is, not so much so, and not
many of them will have.
So we need to step up. We need to
adapt to this change in circumstances
that we didn’t anticipate. We antici-
pate that as many people might come
as has ever came before, but we didn’t
anticipate that maybe 30 percent more
people would come in this category
than ever came before.
In the disaster bill we just passed—by
the way, this is a shameful thing to
have to say—it took over 8 months for
Congress to cover the disasters that
Congress has normally covered right
away. Health and Human Services has
asked for money in an emergency fund-
ing situation to take care of this. Con-
gress should take this request seriously
and pass this funding before there is no
money from any source to take care of
even the basic needs that these unac-
companied kids in our country need to
have taken care of.

S3344 June 12, 2019
Over the weekend and 2 weeks before,
the New York Times—which is no ad-
vocate, by the way, for the Trump ad-
ministration—basically said: Give the
administration the money. This is a le-
gitimate crisis, and it needs to be
treated like that.
In their last editorial, they said:
‘‘Unequipped to deal with the crush,
border facilities and migrant shelters
are dangerously overcrowded, and the
staff is overburdened.’’ They went on
to say: ‘‘Dysfunction, disease, and even
death are a growing reality.’’ The
Washington Post said the same thing.
Let’s deal with this immediate hu-
manitarian crisis. Let’s deal with it
like the people whom we work for ex-
pect us to deal with this. Let’s get this
humanitarian crisis taken care of be-
fore we see a human catastrophe occur.
I hope we can do it, and I hope we can
do it quickly.
With that, I yield the floor.
NOMINATION OF RODNEY SMITH
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, Judge Rodney Smith has an im-
pressive record of honorably serving
the State of Florida, and I am proud to
support his confirmation as a district
judge for the Southern District of Flor-
ida. After receiving a bachelor’s degree
from Florida Agricultural and Mechan-
ical University and a law degree from
Michigan State University, Judge
Smith worked as a personal injury at-
torney. He then pursued a career in
public service as a senior assistant city
attorney for the city of Miami Beach,
before his appointment to the Miami-
Dade County Court in 2008. In my role
as Governor of Florida, I had the honor
of appointing Judge Smith to the Elev-
enth Judicial Circuit Court in 2012.
Judge Smith will continue to serve our
State and Nation well on the Federal
bench.
NOMINATION OF THOMAS P. BARBER
Madam President, I am honored to
support Judge Thomas Barber to serve
as a district judge in the Middle Dis-
trict of Florida. Judge Barber grad-
uated from the University of Florida in
1985 and received a law degree from the
University of Pennsylvania Law School
in 1992. Since then, Judge Barber has
served as an Assistant State Attorney,
an assistant Statewide prosecutor, and
a circuit judge for the Thirteenth Judi-
cial Circuit of Florida. Our citizens de-
serves judges like Judge Barber that
are committed to enforcing our law,
not legislating from the bench. With
his long and distinguished history of
public service, I have no doubt Judge
Barber will serve Americans honorably
as a Federal judge.

HEALTHCARE
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I
come to the floor of the Senate today
to remind people what the far-left
Democrats want to do with our
healthcare.
I am a doctor. I think it is a right
people have to know what the Demo-
crats are proposing. They are peddling
what to me is an extreme one-size-fits-
all healthcare plan. It is a scheme, as I
look at it, because, essentially, Demo-
crats want Washington to take over
your healthcare and my healthcare and
the healthcare of all Americans and ac-
tually control all healthcare in this
Country. They want to take private
health insurance away from 180 million
people who get their insurance through
work.
Under this system, the health plans
that many people like will be gone—
not just for today, not just for tomor-
row, forever gone. There will be no
more individual plans, just Washing-
ton’s one-size-fits-all plan.
Democrats have been lining up to
support this socialist scheme all across
the country. Many leading Democrats
running for President have done so.
They back it, and 112 Democrats who
are Members of the House of Rep-
resentatives are behind it as well.
Radical Democrats, led by Senator
BERNIE SANDERS, have decided that
Washington bureaucrats—not you, not
me, not your doctor—should call the
shots. What care do you need? Wash-
ington, DC, bureaucrats will decide.
How soon will you get the care? Wash-
ington, DC bureaucrats will decide.
Where can you get the care? Wash-
ington, DC, bureaucrats will decide.
The problem with this scheme is it
will have a dramatic impact in this
country on patient care. As a doctor
with decades of experience, I know
Washington shouldn’t control your
medical decisions. That should be up to
you and members of your family. You
should make your own decisions after
you consult with your doctor, not with
a faceless bureaucrat.
For decades, I have given medical
health advice on the radio and on tele-
vision. Each time, in giving one of
these reports, I close with the line:
‘‘Here in Wyoming, I am Dr. JOHN
BARRASSO, helping you care for your-
self.’’
Helping you care for yourself—you
see, you and your doctor are partners
working together, and a good doctor
will focus on what is best for you. Doc-
tors in local communities know who
their patients are, and they know what
their patients need.
What doctors don’t need is a Wash-
ington bureaucrat telling them how to
do their jobs. The point is to protect
patient care and to protect patient
choice. For example, Medicare is a
medical lifeline for our seniors. Still,
with 60 million people relying on Medi-
care, the program is being stretched to
the breaking point.
Waste, fraud, and abuse have made
the problem worse. In 2018, the Govern-
ment Accountability Office found $48
billion in improper Medicare payments.
The government’s watchdog wants re-
forms, and we need reforms to protect
our seniors, so we must strengthen this
vital program for our seniors.
Just think if we pack every Amer-
ican into one government system,
which is what the Democrats are pro-
posing. They call it Medicare for All,
which would quickly become Medicare
for None. One-size-fits-all care will kill
the doctor-patient relationship.
This massive plan is expected to cost
a dramatic amount of money. Those
who looked into this have estimated
the cost to be $32 trillion. It is a hard
number to comprehend. And that is
just for the first 10 years.
Washington is going to have to find
ways—and they will be looking for
ways—to save money, and we have
heard what ways they will be. The Wall
Street Journal notes that any savings
would have to come from cutting pay-
ments to doctors, cutting payments to
providers, cutting payments to hos-
pitals, and restricting care. They are
talking about rationing care—limiting
the care that you need, that you want,
that the government now will say you
cannot have.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budg-
et Office looked at this. They agree.
They say ‘‘the public plan might not be
as quick to meet patients’ needs.’’ It
may not be as quick to meet patients’
needs? So you are diagnosed with can-
cer, and they are not going to be quick
enough to face your needs? Care will be
rationed both in treatment and in tech-
nology.
Democrats, of course, don’t want you
to know about healthcare rationing.
You need to know. You have a right to
know. You deserve to know what they
are proposing. The care you get will be
entirely the government’s call because
the Democrats’ plan bans all private
insurance in the country. If you have it
through work, you will lose it.
What about paying your doctor di-
rectly for services? Well, Washington
Democrats have a plan for that. They
want to put an end to that as well.
Doctors would have to leave the gov-
ernment-run system. They couldn’t
take care of any other patients who are
on that system if they entered into a
private contract with individual pa-
tients.
Even the Washington Post newspaper
admits the plan has problems. The Post
recently ran this headline: ‘‘No matter
what Sanders says, there’s no Medi-
care-for-all without tradeoffs.’’
I agree. And the tradeoffs could turn
out to be fatal. Democrats’ one-size-
fits-all healthcare means you will pay
more to wait longer for worse care.
As a Senator and a doctor, my focus
continues to be on improving patient

care. Real healthcare reform is needed
in this country. Reforms are needed to
lower the costs without lowering the
standards. Regrettably, what the
Democrats are proposing lowers the
standards and raises the costs—the
exact opposite of what is so vitally im-
portant for all of us.
These are the issues that Republicans
are working on right now: empowering
you to buy coverage that works for
you, lowering the cost of your prescrip-
tion drugs, protecting you when you
have a preexisting condition, and
eliminating surprise medical bills. But
with the Democrats’ one-size-fits-all
care, you would lose the insurance you
get through work, and you would lose
Medicare Advantage if you are a senior
who is one of the 20 million people who
gets their insurance through that pro-
gram.
They call it Medicare Advantage be-
cause there are advantages for seniors
who are on it. It coordinates care.
There is preventive care. Those are the
advantages.
You will likely lose the doctor-pa-
tient relationship that you have de-
pended on for years and lose the free-
dom to make your own medical deci-
sions.
I say it is time to reject this one-size-
fits-all scheme that would make all of
us pay more and wait longer for worse
care. Instead, let’s work together to
give patients the care they need from a
doctor they choose, and do it at lower
costs.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

MEDICAID
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, we
are on the floor, and I will be joined by
colleagues to talk about the program
we know as Medicaid—a program that I
think we are beginning to appreciate
more, especially in the last couple of
years—and the impact it has on the
American people.
Unfortunately, the debates on
healthcare have resulted in Medicaid
becoming a target. Too often, both in
the Senate and in the other body—the
other body, the House—the Medicaid
Program has been the subject of at-
tempts to do at least one of three
things, if not all three.
One is attempts to decimate the pro-
gram by way of funding cuts over the
next 10 years. We know the President’s
budget has proposed cutting Medicaid
by $1.5 trillion over 10 years—that is
with a ‘‘t’’—roughly, $150 billion each
and every year for 10 years. That is a
bad idea, and we are going to fight that
with all we have.
Other attempts to slash Medicaid
have been perpetuated over time, ei-
ther to cut it over 10 years or to cut it
in a particular year.
The third thing we have seen is sabo-
tage efforts by the administration
when it comes to the exchanges result-
ing from the Affordable Care Act but
also attempts to sabotage the Medicaid
Program itself. I will develop that in a
moment in terms of the attempts by
the administration.
Medicaid is a program that, I think,
tells us who we are as a nation. We are
a great nation for a number of reasons.
We all know we have the strongest
military and the strongest economy.
When we are at our best, we are an ex-
ample to the world. We are also the
greatest country in the world because
of the way we attempt—don’t always
do the right thing and don’t always do
as much as we should—but because of
our attempts to take care of folks who
need help and to give opportunity to
folks who might need a door to be
opened or an opportunity to be pre-
sented to them.
Medicaid is one of those examples of
American greatness when we get it
right. Medicaid is the program that we
know is responsible for making sure
seniors can get into nursing homes. Ab-
sent Medicaid, millions of seniors
wouldn’t be able to have the benefit of
skilled care in a nursing home. Some-
thing on the order of 60 percent of sen-
iors have an opportunity to get skilled
care because of Medicaid. Absent Med-
icaid, it is highly likely they wouldn’t
be able to get that care, especially
when you consider the cost of care to
just one family. It would cost tens and
tens of thousands of dollars.
Medicaid is the program that takes
care of a huge share of the Nation’s
children, and a subset of that, of
course, is children with disabilities. We
are told, just in Pennsylvania alone—
the most recent number I have seen—54
percent of children with disabilities
have their healthcare provided to them
by Medicaid. Thank goodness that is
the case, and we have to make sure
that continues.
Just consider the birth of a child. We
know, whether it is Pennsylvania or
the Nation, the number exceeds 40 per-
cent. Forty percent of all the births in
the country—more than 40 percent, I
should say—are paid for by the Med-
icaid Program. So the Medicaid Pro-
gram affects the family in so many dif-
ferent ways: the family, when it comes
to a birth, in very high numbers across
the country; the family, when it comes
to providing healthcare for children
and to give children the opportunity
not just to have coverage and insur-
ance but to have early screening, early
diagnosis, and testing—the kind of pre-
ventive care, in a sense, that we hope
anyone would receive but especially a
young child.
Medicaid, of course, goes from, to use
Senator Hubert Humphrey’s line, ‘‘the
dawn of life to the twilight of life’’—
from children all the way through to
older Americans and folks in between
there who might have a disability.
Probably every Member of the Senate
has received a letter from a family who
has a loved one with a disability, espe-
cially a child, expressing how Medicaid
is important to them.
We all know these debates are criti-
cally important to what happens to
Medicaid. If we allow the majority in
the Senate, and if we allow the admin-
istration to have its way, we would
have substantial cuts to Medicaid—
maybe not a trillion and a half, as the
administration has proposed, but sub-
stantial cuts that would hurt the
American family.
I wanted to highlight some of the
ways I mentioned earlier that the ad-
ministration has tried to sabotage
Medicaid. That is my view of it. Here
are some examples: Starting in Janu-
ary of 2018, the administration under-
took an effort to allow States, for the
first time, to take away Medicaid cov-
erage from people who are not working
or who are not engaged in work-related
activities for a specific number of
hours each month. In Arkansas, for ex-
ample—this was the first State to im-
plement this new policy by the admin-
istration—over 18,000 Medicaid bene-
ficiaries lost coverage in 2018 due to
the new requirements. Almost one in
four people were subject to the new
rules.
While a Federal district court re-
cently struck down restrictive waivers
in both Arkansas and Kentucky, the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services, the so-called CMS, continues
to approve these policies in additional
States.
So that is one attempt to knock peo-
ple off Medicaid in the calendar year
2018—18,000.
Another attempt was in the State of
Utah. HHS, Health and Human Serv-
ices, a Federal agency, has also ap-
proved an unprecedented authority for
States to deny coverage for people who
otherwise would be eligible for Med-
icaid. This authority undermines Med-
icaid’s guarantee of healthcare cov-
erage to low-income people who meet
the eligibility criteria set by Congress.
Earlier this year, Health and Human
Services approved a proposal to allow
the State of Utah to cap enrollment
based solely on State funding deci-
sions. So, in other words, once the
number of enrollees reaches the State’s
funding cap, other eligible people
would be shut out of coverage. An arbi-
trary enrollment cap limits enrollment
on a first-come, first-serve basis and
would treat similarly situated people
very differently, depending on when
they apply for coverage, effectively
holding low-income people’s healthcare
coverage hostage—hostage to State
lawmakers’ annual budget decisions on
how many people should get coverage.
So this is another way to limit Med-
icaid coverage.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3348 June 12, 2019
Now, Health and Human Services is
reportedly working on a block grant
guidance for States that could give
States the latitude to cut coverage of
services or provide payments in ways
not allowed under Federal law.
So here are just a couple of examples
of what the administration is doing
that I would argue is sabotage: cutting
Medicaid by providing waivers that
have not been provided before to the
States. I don’t think coverage of Med-
icaid should be determined by a purely
budgetary decision at the State level.
States have to balance their budget.
They have constraints. The Federal
Government should ensure that anyone
who is eligible for Medicaid should re-
ceive it. There are those who say: Well,
if you go down that path, the Federal
Government will not be able to afford
it.
I have heard words used on this floor
and other places around the Capitol
that the cost of Medicaid is
‘‘unsustainable.’’ That is the word that
is used over and over—unsustainable.
I wonder if the same people, the same
Members of Congress, use the word
‘‘unsustainable’’ for corporate tax cuts
that went into effect starting in late
2017, where there was a corporate tax
reduction voted on in the Senate where
that reduction went from a 35-percent
rate down to a 21-percent rate. The
original idea was to go from 35 to 20,
and it ended up at 21. So that is a 14-
point reduction in the corporate tax
rate. We were told, if we did that, if we
all agreed to do that—I did not agree
with it—but if we were to agree to do
that and the bill went through and be-
came law, which it did, that somehow
wages would be increased for workers
across the board. In fact, the White
House, at that time, promised that
wages would go up $4,000 per worker—
$4,000. I haven’t had a steady stream of
workers coming to my office saying
they got a $4,000 wage increase because
of the December 2017 tax bill. In fact,
they are telling me the opposite. Many
of them are paying more than they
were before that tax bill.
I make that point and relate it to
Medicaid very simply because the same
folks who talked about and have advo-
cated for and even voted repeatedly to
cut Medicaid are the same folks who
often supported a corporate tax cut
that cost over a trillion dollars and
was not paid for. Then the same people
say: Oh, my goodness. We have a tril-
lion-plus hole in the budget so we have
to go and cut Medicaid or Medicare. So
what results now is a little more than
a year later—a year and a half later,
after the tax bill passed, what do we
have? We have the administration com-
ing forward saying: We have to cut
Medicaid by a trillion and a half over
the next 10 years and Medicare by over
$845 billion over the next 10 years. That
is the tradeoff: cut Medicaid and Medi-
care, in essence, to pay for a corporate
tax cut.
Remember, every point they reduce
that corporate tax cut—when they
went from 35 to 34, the cost of that is
$100 billion over 10 years. Then, when it
went from 34 to 33, another $100 billion
is implicated in that cut, and you can
see the reduction. For every point of
the corporate tax cut, it will cost the
Nation, over 10 years, $100 billion.
So when folks start talking about the
cost of Medicaid being unsustainable, I
just think that is a camouflage for
what they really want to do, which is
to cut Medicaid and reduce those who
are eligible.
I am going to try, with everything I
have, to prevent them from doing that
because last time I checked, Medicaid
was a program about us. It is an ‘‘us’’
program, not a program for someone
over there—someone who is distant
from us. Medicaid, as we found out
most recently in the debates about
healthcare, is a program about us,
about who we are. It is about babies
being born. It is about kids with dis-
abilities. It is about children who live
in families who are very low income.
The families are thereby eligible for
Medicaid, and that child not only has
coverage but has the kind of early pre-
ventive healthcare we would hope
every child has.
And Medicaid is also about the mem-
bers of our family who are senior citi-
zens trying to get skilled care.
So we are going to have a long dis-
cussion today, at least for the better
part of an hour, about Medicaid, and I
am grateful that colleagues of mine are
willing to come to the floor and talk
about this critically important pro-
gram and what is at stake for our fami-
lies.
Mr. BROWN. I want to join my friend
Senator CASEY today to talk about the
importance of Medicaid. I want to echo
his comments and Senator WYDEN’s
comments, particularly given the at-
tacks from the White House and State
legislatures and, frankly, too many in
this body.
I am still incredulous when I think
about what happened in this body and
has happened many times. In my State,
900,000 people have insurance because
of the Affordable Care Act. The expan-
sion of Medicaid meant hundreds of
thousands of families can rest easier
knowing they will have health insur-
ance when they need it.
I have sat in this body a number of
times and watched my colleagues—
mostly on that said of the aisle, well-
dressed, well-paid, health insurance
paid for by taxpayers—who are willing
to cast a vote to take insurance away
from hundreds of thousands in their
States. Again, these are elected offi-
cials who have taken an oath of office,
who have insurance paid for by tax-
payers, and they are willing to take in-
surance away from others.
I will illustrate with one story. Four-
teen people in Ohio die every day from
an overdose—more than any State in
the country. I know it is a serious
problem in Montana and a serious
problem all over the country but more
in Ohio than most places. Our State
legislature wants to make it harder for
Ohioans to get that care and so does
President Trump. President Trump
continues to try to take insurance
away.
These aren’t people sitting at home.
Most of these people under Medicaid
expansion were workers making $10,
$12, and $15 an hour, working every bit
as hard as Senators do, but they don’t
have jobs that provide insurance so
they depended on the expansion of
Medicaid. These are people working
hard.
This President wants to take their
insurance from them. Senator MCCON-
NELL, down the hall, wants to take
their insurance from them. They cast
votes. This isn’t hyperbole or me mak-
ing this up.
Let me tell you a story real quick.
One of the best treatment centers in
Ohio is called Talbert House. I was at
Talbert House one day in Cincinnati. I
sat with a man and his daughter. He
turned to me, put his hand on his
daughter’s arm, and said: Without Med-
icaid, my daughter would be dead. How
dare Members of this body—elected of-
ficials who are supposed to represent
the public interest—take away insur-
ance from people like his daughter.
Every day I just can’t believe it.
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I will at
this time yield the floor to my distin-
guished colleague from the State of
Washington, Senator MURRAY. We are
honored by her presence here on the
floor. I will come back a little later.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRAMER). The Senator from Wash-
ington.
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want
to thank my colleague for starting this
really important discussion that all of
us should be very well aware of, and I
appreciate his leadership.
People across this country have been
absolutely clear. They want us to fight
for families who are struggling with
high healthcare costs and help to make
sure that everyone in our country can
get quality affordable care. But while
Democrats have been coming forward
with solutions and calling on Repub-
licans to come to the table to address
the healthcare sabotage they have
helped President Trump accomplish,
instead, they have been repeatedly on
the other side, refusing to fight the fire
and having only just shown real inter-
est in fanning the flames.
There are so many glaring examples
about how President Trump has
worked to sabotage families’
healthcare. We are here today to focus
on just one—the tireless efforts to un-
dermine Medicaid.
It is a program that helps people
across the country get affordable, qual-
ity healthcare. State after State has
now worked to expand Medicaid in re-
cent years, and time after time, we
have all seen the benefits of those ef-
forts. Data shows us that Medicaid has
helped reduce racial disparities in
healthcare. It has helped us increase

access to treatment for opioid use dis-
order. It is a critical need as our coun-
try confronts a nationwide epidemic. It
has helped to improve maternal and in-
fant health, another area where we des-
perately need to make progress.
Medicaid expansion has helped tens
of millions of people get quality, af-
fordable healthcare. That is exactly
why States that expanded Medicaid
have seen their uninsured rates drop
more than those that did not.
Yet some Republicans have tried
every trick in the book to try to under-
mine that progress. Back when Repub-
licans were first calling for their harm-
ful TrumpCare plan, they made clear
that they wanted to put Medicaid on
the chopping block in a very big way—
not only rolling back Medicaid expan-
sion but proposing deep cuts for moms
and kids and people with disabilities
and seniors who need those long-term
services and support. Even after people
across the country spoke up and pushed
back and defeated that backward pro-
posal, Republicans have still tried to
take away care from millions of fami-
lies across the country who rely on
Medicaid.
President Trump has called for enor-
mous cuts to Medicaid in his budget
proposals. He has pushed for burden-
some paperwork requirements that
serve no real purpose except to put up
barriers that make it harder for people
to get the care they need and easier for
him to take their care away.
Here in Congress, Republican leader-
ship made clear that their preferred
way to pay for the expensive tax
breaks they gave to corporations and
the wealthy was to cut programs like
Medicaid that gave healthcare to those
who struggle and are in need.
Even as President Trump and Repub-
licans fight against the wishes of peo-
ple across the country for these back-
ward proposals, they are fighting to
dismantle Medicaid in court as well.
If President Trump gets his way in
his blatantly partisan lawsuits, not
only will protections for people with
preexisting conditions be struck down,
not only will young adults be dropped
from parents’ plans, not only will es-
sential health benefits that ensure cov-
erage and that include prescription
drug coverage and maternity care and
more go away, not only will lifetime
annual caps on coverage return—even
for people who are insured through
their employer, by the way—but if
President Trump has his way in court,
Medicaid expansion also will be struck
down and tens of millions of families in
this country will have the care that
they rely on today taken away.
That is wrong, and Democrats are
not going to stand for it. We are going
to be here to defend patients’ care and
look to expand coverage and improve
quality for families.
I am really proud that my home
State of Washington is leading the
way. In my home State, instead of tak-
ing Medicaid away from people, we are
taking on even more challenges
through the program. Our State is
showing how Medicaid can help to pro-
vide people with long-term care bene-
fits in their home, and how it can help
address employment challenges and
housing needs and other social deter-
minants of health that improve the
health of our entire communities.
In short, we are showing how Med-
icaid can do more, while many Repub-
licans here in the Nation’s Capital are
trying to get it so it does less.
Enough is enough. It is time for Re-
publicans to stop sabotaging our fami-
lies’ care, stop trying to take coverage
away from families and make it more
expensive and out of reach, stop trying
to undermine Medicaid and the lives of
the millions of people who rely on it
and start working with Democrats to
fight for patients and for families.
If Republicans want to keep sitting
by and cheering on the harmful
healthcare sabotage proposals, they are
going to keep seeing families and pa-
tients and Democrats standing up to
hold them accountable.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania.
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President I want to
thank my colleague from the State of
Washington for outlining the chal-
lenges presented now to Medicaid in
terms of efforts by Republicans, which
I have described with three words: deci-
mate, slash, and sabotage. I think all
three are an accurate description of
what they have tried to do.
But I am also grateful that Senator
MURRAY was highlighting some of the
great benefits of the program in her
initial remarks on the floor.
We just had a report yesterday from
a great organization called Protect Our
Care. I will not read the entire report,
but I was struck by a few findings that
they summarized in that report,
quoting from various studies about the
impact of Medicaid. Here are just a
few. A number of these findings relate
to Medicaid expansion, which was the
expansion of Medicaid that became law
when the Affordable Care Act was
passed back in 2010, but it is only now,
years after Medicaid expansion has
gone into effect, that the impact is
being felt in a very positive way.
For just a couple of highlights here
on Medicaid expansion, for example,
expansion was associated with lower
rates of maternal mortality. In this
case, the research was done by the
Georgetown University Center for Chil-
dren and Families. The research also
found that States that had expanded
Medicaid experienced 1.6 fewer mater-
nal deaths per 100,000 women than
States that refused to expand Med-
icaid.
As folks might remember, the law al-
lowed States to expand Medicaid, but a
number of States had not taken advan-
tage of that. There is a clear advantage
for States that expanded on this indi-
cator for maternal mortality.
A second finding, in addition to re-
ducing maternal mortality, is that
Medicaid expansion has also been asso-
ciated with a significant reduction in
infant mortality.
A study published in the American
Journal of Public Health in April of
2018 found that the decline in infant
mortality was more than 50 percent
greater in States that expanded Med-
icaid, compared to those that did not.
So there is a second finding on infant
mortality.
Beyond improving health sur-
rounding childbirth, Medicaid expan-
sion improves access to family plan-
ning. A University of Michigan study
found that one-third of women enrolled
in the State of Michigan’s expanded
Medicaid Program reported that their
coverage improved access to birth con-
trol and family planning services.
Michelle Moniz, a doctor, the study’s
lead author, concluded that her team’s
findings ‘‘suggest that the expansion
provided an important service for popu-
lations with a high unmet need for
family planning care.’’
So there are just three examples and
three different studies, with one vali-
dating the benefit of Medicaid expan-
sion to reduce maternal mortality. So
fewer pregnant mothers are dying, in
the case of one study, because of Med-
icaid expansion.
The second study is talking about re-
ducing infant mortality because of
Medicaid expansion, and the third says
that, because of Medicaid expansion,
there is improving access to family
planning.
So those are just three examples in
three different studies about the ben-
efit of Medicaid expansion.
Unfortunately—and it is important
to put this on the record—when you see
the Republican bills to repeal the Af-
fordable Care Act, every one of them
seems to have one thing the common:
They don’t simply talk about limiting
Medicaid expansion. They don’t just
talk about cutting it back. A number
of these proposals that we have debated
here—and I guess we only had a vote in
the Senate on one—they all have in
common that they want to eliminate
Medicaid expansion—not just cut it but
eliminate it.
Somehow, for some reason, and I will
never understand this, my Republican
colleagues want to get rid of Medicaid
expansion. They seem to think it was a
bad thing, that it was a bad result for
the American people that Medicaid ex-
pansion became law and States were
able to take advantage of it, increasing
the number of people covered by some-
thing on the order, at last count, of 12
million people.
Why is it a bad thing that 12 million
people got healthcare? I will never be
able to understand that, as long as I
live. Why is it wrong, why is it bad
that 12 million more people got
healthcare through Medicaid expan-
sion?
Is it also then, by extension, a bad
thing to reduce maternal mortality? Is
that a bad thing as well? Is that a bad
result? Is it also a bad result of Med-
icaid expansion that we were able to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3350 June 12, 2019
show in States that expanded Medicaid
that infant mortality goes down? Is
that a bad result? Is it a bad result in
States that expanded Medicaid, as op-
posed to States that did not, that in
addition to the reduction in maternal
mortality and infant mortality, that
there was access to family planning? Is
that a bad thing as well?
I don’t think many Americans would
reach that conclusion. They would
argue, I think, just upon the coverage
question, that 12 million people or
more getting healthcare is an advance-
ment—that we are all better off when
12 million get healthcare coverage.
There seems to be a prevailing point
of view here among some that if the
guy next to you gets healthcare, some-
how that diminishes you. That is con-
trary to all the evidence, contrary to
all the studies about coverage. But in
the case of Medicaid expansion, it is
not simply that 12 million more Ameri-
cans got coverage, but now there is em-
pirical data and empirical results that
tell us that maternal mortality is like-
ly to go down and infant mortality is
likely to go down. That is a good re-
sult.
That is why, when people talk about
cutting Medicaid by a trillion and a
half over the next 10 years, or elimi-
nating Medicaid expansion, they have
some explaining to do.
Now, maybe if they have a study
showing that in States that did not ex-
pand Medicaid they have a strategy to
get infant mortality numbers down and
maternal mortality numbers down,
let’s hear the competing argument. I
haven’t heard that, though. I am still
waiting for it.
Here is another good result of Med-
icaid expansion. It has also proven to
be a potent tool for reducing—this is
according to the Protect Our Care re-
port from yesterday. Again, I am still
quoting from it. Medicaid expansion
has proven to be a potent tool for re-
ducing racial disparities in healthcare.
Black babies are twice as likely, ac-
cording to this report, as White babies
to be born at low birth weight, and are
1.5 times as likely to be born pre-
maturely.
One study published in the Journal of
the American Medical Association in
April 2019 found that when considering
low birthweight babies and preterm
birth outcomes overall, Medicaid ex-
pansion was associated with significant
improvements in relative disparities
for Black infants compared with White
infants in States that expanded Med-
icaid versus those that did not—signifi-
cant improvements in relative dispari-
ties. That is a good result we know
about now—not a theory, a good result
from Medicaid expansion.
I will give you another one. This is
about opioid use disorder. I have no
doubt that the problems we have had
all across the country—the epidemic of
substance use disorder, a subset of that
being the problems with opioid addic-
tion—and all of the horror and misery
and skyrocketing deaths from that
scourge, that public health emer-
gency—I have no doubt that the con-
cern about that is bipartisan. We have
done a lot of bipartisan work here in
the Senate to dedicate new dollars—
billions and billions of dollars—to help
on that. The only problem is, we need
many billions more just to meet the
treatment needs of those who are al-
ready in that awful grip of an opioid
addiction.
We have bipartisan concern and bi-
partisan action. That is good. I want to
acknowledge that. But here is the prob-
lem: When it comes to Medicaid expan-
sion’s role, there seems to be a little
disconnect between and among Mem-
bers of the Senate on that.
Here is what Protect Our Care tells
us: Multiple studies suggest that Med-
icaid expansion plays a crucial role in
improving access to treatment for
opioid use disorder.
A February 2018 Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities analysis of data
from the Federal Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality found
that Medicaid expansion dramatically
reduced—I will say it again—dramati-
cally reduced the share of opioid-re-
lated hospitalizations in which pa-
tients were uninsured, so making sure
that more people in the grip of that ad-
diction who present themselves for
help actually have insurance coverage.
Here is a quotation from the Center
on Budget and Policy Priorities study:
‘‘The share of hospitalizations in which
the patient was uninsured fell dramati-
cally in states that expanded Medicaid:
from 13.4 percent in 2013 (the year be-
fore expansion took effect) to just 2.9
percent two years later.’’ So it went
from roughly 13 percent down to basi-
cally just 3 percent. So that is another
result.
I have to ask the question again.
Why is it a bad thing that roughly 12
million people got health insurance
through Medicaid expansion? Why is it
a bad thing that Medicaid expansion
now has a demonstrated track record
on reducing infant mortality and ma-
ternal mortality and helping begin to
bridge a racial disparity between a
child who happens to be an African
American child versus a child who is
not? Why is that a bad thing?
Why would you propose, with that
track record—and I am only men-
tioning a few—why would you propose
eliminating the program? That seems
to be the prevailing point of view in
virtually every healthcare bill that is
offered on this side of the aisle—to
take Medicaid expansion and eliminate
it over time. Why would you do that?
I could understand better the argu-
ment where they said: Well, look, we
have a new idea. We have an idea that
will reduce infant mortality, maternal
mortality, bridge some of those racial
gaps, and cover 12 million people with
a new program, a new approach. I
would listen a little then and maybe
consider their ideas. But when you call
for the elimination over and over again
of a program with that track record in
just a couple of years—and this isn’t
longitudinal data over decades; we
know right away the benefits of more
people getting coverage, more children
getting treatment, and people in the
grip of an opioid addiction having in-
surance and therefore having coverage.
In Pennsylvania, there are tens of
thousands of people—not thousands,
tens of thousands—who are getting
treatment for an opioid or substance
use disorder condition solely because
they happen to live in a State that ex-
panded Medicaid. If they lived in a
State that didn’t expand it, they would
be pretty much on their own when it
comes to getting treatment or services
for that kind of an addiction.
I really have trouble understanding
what my colleagues have presented. If
you want to introduce a bill to change
healthcare, I think it is incumbent
upon you to have an alternative, have
a better way of covering as many peo-
ple, have coverage that is affordable,
and have a strategy that will accom-
plish what we have already accom-
plished through the Affordable Care
Act. That number is even bigger. It is
the Medicaid expansion number plus
folks who get their coverage through
the exchanges. That number is above 20
million.
So if you have a better proposal, you
ought to present it. But they haven’t.
That is unfortunate because now we
are facing the prospect of not just pro-
posals that could pass and be signed
into law by this President that would
destroy the opportunity for 20 million
people to have healthcare, but a big
share of that would be cutting Med-
icaid expansion.
The other part that is a direct threat
to Medicaid itself is the lawsuit mak-
ing its way through a Federal court. I
have heard a number of my colleagues
say: Oh, no, we want to preserve pro-
tections for preexisting conditions. We
want to preserve most of Medicaid. We
want to cut the costs, and we want to
preserve it.
Well, if you have those goals, if you
say you are really for having all those
consumer protections from the Afford-
able Care Act, and if you really care
about seniors getting into nursing
homes because of Medicaid and you
care and you want to preserve that,
and you care about kids with disabil-
ities who have their healthcare
through Medicaid and you want to pre-
serve their healthcare, and you want to
preserve healthcare for kids from low-
income families through Medicaid—if
you believe all that, you have to op-
pose the lawsuit. You can’t make the
argument that you care about those
Americans and you care about
healthcare and protections and all of
that and then say you support the law-
suit. You have to come out against the
lawsuit.
Make a statement—you should if you
are serious about it, if you are honest
about it—or maybe file something with
the Federal court, maybe a formal fil-
ing to say: Here is why I oppose the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3351
June 12, 2019
lawsuit. File a brief. Do something.
But at least tell the American people
the truth. If you are going to be for
preserving these kinds of protections,
you can’t be for the lawsuit. In fact,
you would have to be unalterably op-
posed to the lawsuit if you really care
about those kinds of major healthcare
issues, including Medicaid.
If you were really concerned about
Medicaid and you wanted to preserve
most of it and you had ideas about how
to change it for the better, you can’t
support the sabotage by the adminis-
tration because the effect in a number
of these States with these waivers is
that people lose their Medicaid cov-
erage—as I said, we now know that in
2018, 18,000 people in Arkansas lost cov-
erage. That will be replicated in other
States. Tennessee now is one of the
States considering a block-grant pro-
posal. Utah—I mentioned what they
are doing—tying Medicaid to the State
budget, instead of covering folks who
are eligible as opposed to tying cov-
erage and care to how much money is
in the State budget.
I think that if you are going to make
an argument in favor of Medicaid, you
have to oppose the lawsuit and you
have to stop the sabotage.
The third thing you can do to be hon-
est about what you say you believe in—
and constructive here—is to say we
shouldn’t cut Medicaid by $1.5 trillion
over the next 10 years, as the adminis-
tration proposed. Just say you are
against what the administration pro-
posed and you don’t think we should
cut it by $1.5 trillion. And you should
add your opposition to the cuts to
Medicare. The administration proposal
is to cut Medicare by $845 billion over
10 years. You should oppose that as
well.
If you do that—if you oppose the sab-
otage, oppose the lawsuit, and oppose
the budget cuts—then we can have a
conversation about lowering the cost of
healthcare, lowering the cost of pre-
scription drugs, and preserving Med-
icaid as much as humanly possible even
when costs go up. It is pretty apparent
to me that a lot of Americans rely
upon Medicaid.
How about if you represent a State,
for example, that has a substantial
rural population? I represent the State
of Pennsylvania, which has 67 counties,
but 48 of them are considered rural. We
have a lot of rural communities, a lot
of counties where there may not be ag-
riculture in every corner, but there are
a lot of small towns and a lot of rural
communities, and they tend to be one
and the same. These are communities
that are faced with several levels of
challenges. They often have job loss be-
cause a substantial employer has left.
They often have infrastructure prob-
lems because they have a lot of bridges
that are structurally deficient. They
have all kinds of other economic chal-
lenges that sometimes relate to the
markets and agriculture and so many
other problems. Many of these commu-
nities also have a so-called digital di-
vide—they are living in a county where
40, 50, 60 percent of the people who live
in that county don’t have access to
broadband, high-speed internet.
In addition to all those problems in
some rural areas, they also have a
problem with healthcare access. The
good news here is that there are a lot
of kids in rural areas who get their
healthcare through—guess what—Med-
icaid. Big numbers. In some places, the
numbers of children covered by Med-
icaid and the Children’s Health Insur-
ance Program are much higher than in
urban areas.
In a rural area, if you start cutting
Medicaid and eliminating Medicaid ex-
pansion, as many around here want to
do, you are not only going to hurt a
child in an urban community or in a
small town, but you are also going to
hurt a child in a rural community very
badly.
It gets worse from there. If you cut
Medicaid, rural hospitals that are al-
ready on the brink of failure or bank-
ruptcy or at least downturn in their
ability to balance their budgets—a lot
of those rural hospitals will fail. We
know that. The data is pretty clear on
that.
If all of your focus is on a rural area
and you think rural children should
have the chance for good-quality
healthcare, and if you think rural hos-
pitals—sometimes the biggest employ-
ers in a community—should remain
open, you should really care about
Medicaid. You should really be worried
about proposals to cut it by $1.5 tril-
lion over a decade, as the administra-
tion proposes. You should be very con-
cerned about proposals to eliminate
Medicaid expansion because guess what
is another challenge in a lot of these
communities—the opioid substance use
disorder crisis.
My colleagues are here, and I want to
make sure they have an opportunity to
weigh in as well. We are privileged to
be joined by two colleagues.
I yield the floor to my colleague from
the State of Oregon, the senior Senator
from the State of Oregon.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon.
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before
Senator CASEY leaves the floor, I just
want to make a couple of remarks, as
the senior Democrat on the Finance
Committee, a ranking member. I par-
ticularly want to praise Senator CASEY
for being our go-to person on the whole
issue of Medicaid.
Ever since we began to see the sub-
stantial cuts in 2017, as Senator CASEY
knows, he has been the person we have
said is our go-to leader for the most
vulnerable Americans who count on
Medicaid being there for them.
I want to tell a short story about one
of Senator CASEY’s many contributions
to those who find Medicaid to be just a
healthcare lifeline. When the Trump
administration began its attack on
Medicaid benefits, I had been the direc-
tor of the Gray Panthers at home be-
fore I got involved in public service,
and a lot of folks came to me. They
said: Ron, that probably isn’t a big deal
for seniors because Medicare covers
most of those nursing home bills. And
I had to say: Gosh, that is really not
the case. Medicare really covers only a
small fraction of nursing home bills. It
covers the bills that are essentially for
hospital-like services, and most of
nursing home care in America really
ends up getting picked up by Medicaid.
Something like two out of every three
beds in long-term care facilities, which
are custodial facilities, end up being
funded by Medicaid.
Senator CASEY basically took it upon
himself, as part of this effort, to lead
the Democrats on the Finance Com-
mittee and to lead the Democrats in
our caucus to go out and talk about
what this really means to the most
vulnerable people in America. As my
colleagues know, probably 4 or 5
months into this debate with this re-
lentless attack on Medicaid coming
week after week after week, most
Americans began to understand a little
bit about what was on the line for mil-
lions of senior citizens.
I thank my colleague because he
really began the effort to make the
point that growing older in America is
really an expensive proposition. Even
when you save and you scrimp, you
don’t go on a vacation, you don’t buy
the boat, and you don’t do the extra,
growing older is really an expensive
proposition. So if you have a widower
on the corner in your neighborhood,
and he always mowed his lawn, and he
always helped with the sports teams
and the like, and now he is getting
kind of frail and may need some nurs-
ing home care, now we still have a safe-
ty net, an essential safety net for those
people.
I am going to talk a little bit about
some of the challenges of Medicaid.
But I would like particularly to begin
my remarks—Senator CARDIN has been
an advocate in the Finance Committee,
as well, on Medicaid—by pointing out
that Senator CASEY, really, at the very
outset of this discussion, began the ef-
fort to make the case that a lot of peo-
ple weren’t aware of, and that is that
Medicaid is a safety net for millions of
older people.
Here is the story of Medicaid in 2019.
For the vulnerable in America, our
people want to make sure that there is
more access to Medicaid. Unfortu-
nately, on the other side of the aisle,
Republicans are taking that very ac-
cess away. Just for a few minutes, I am
going to draw out this contrast because
there is quite a difference of opinion
between how the majority party in the
Trump White House are working
against the interests of vulnerable
folks across the country.
As I mentioned, 2016 saw the begin-
ning of this all-out attack by Repub-
licans on Medicaid—hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars in cuts, proposed caps,
block grants, basically an unravelling
of the program as we know it today.
Essentially, from Portland, OR, to
Portland, ME, people said: No way. We

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3352 June 12, 2019
are not going to support this kind of
attack on Medicaid. So in some States,
like Utah, they chose the ballot box to
actually expand Medicaid under the Af-
fordable Care Act. The voters chose
more access to Medicaid, not less. But
Republican lawmakers in Utah had de-
cided to deny them their choice. Just
think about that one.
I sure hear a lot of talk on the other
side of the aisle about States’ rights
and empowering people at home. This
is an example of where voters chose
more access to Medicaid, not less. The
Republican lawmakers said: Hey, we
know better than that. We are not
going to give folks that choice. So
Utah lawmakers took a hatchet to the
plan that voters approved on election
day and started carving it out. The
only expansion they would allow is a
lot smaller than what voters wanted—
spending more money to cover fewer
people.
Then lawmakers in Utah followed a
path cleared in other Republican-con-
trolled States, and that was to punish
those who were enrolled in Medicaid
with essentially bureaucratic water
torture, with such a barrage of paper-
work that it was almost impossible to
penetrate what was really necessary to
get through the program. This has been
seen in Arkansas, Kentucky, and else-
where.
All of this, of course, is not couched
in the bureaucratic maze of redtape it
actually is. The discussion is always:
Well, this is just about work. That is
just not true. It is about getting people
kicked off their healthcare.
When you talk about Medicaid pa-
tients, you are talking about people
who are working and people who want
to work. What we are up against are a
host of Republican schemes that are
basically putting stacks of paperwork
between those who need healthcare and
their doctors.
These are busy working people with
kids to raise, older parents to care for,
and bills to pay. Yet lawmakers are
trying to force them to fill out stacks
and stacks of paperwork just to make
sure that somebody can actually find
their way through the maze and see a
doctor.
If you look at what happened in Ar-
kansas in 2018, you get a sense of how
destructive these bureaucratic schemes
are to people’s healthcare. There were
18,000 people who lost their Medicaid
coverage—18,000 people. Trump offi-
cials swore up and down that those pa-
perwork requirements wouldn’t hurt
anybody, but as we saw when the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services
came before the Finance Committee
earlier this year, they shrugged when
you asked why so many people lost
their coverage in Arkansas after the
paperwork requirements were put in
place.
A Federal judge even weighed in,
blocking all of this paperwork, while
the Trump administration continued to
push the States to take them up. The
schemes spread to States across the
country, and it was not just paperwork.
With the Trump administration’s
blessing, Tennessee is the first State
trying to turn its Medicaid Program
into a block grant. This basically takes
a sledgehammer to Medicaid as we
know it now. Medicaid block grants
mean putting nursing home care—
which I just outlined earlier in dis-
cussing Senator CASEY’s important
role here—at risk for millions of sen-
iors. You risk children and people with
disabilities having to be cut off from
their healthcare. But block-granting
Medicaid is one of the top goals for Re-
publicans in the Trump administra-
tion.
Finally, Trump administration budg-
et slashers are trying a new, additional
scheme that is going to hurt so many
people across the country. In this par-
ticular area, they basically are trying
to bring some mathematical sleight of
hand so they can change key economic
measures in ways that boot vulnerable
people off Medicaid and off food
stamps.
What they are doing here—again,
this is all shrouded in language that
just sounds eminently reasonable—is
basically talking about where the pov-
erty line ought to be, and then they
want to find an artificial way to push
the poverty line down without doing
anything to lift people out of economic
hardship. So you are talking about par-
ents who work long, hard hours and
still struggle to make ends meet, peo-
ple who are trying to find affordable
housing, who have practically given up
the idea of being able to save for retire-
ment, and who are still trying to pay
college tuition. What does the Trump
administration say? These people just
have life too easy.
The impact of this change would be
enormous. Three hundred thousand
children could lose comprehensive
health coverage, and a quarter million
adults could lose their coverage.
Colleagues, this is the Medicaid agen-
da for Senate Republicans and the
Trump administration: Let’s go out
there and look under every possible
rock to find a scheme to restrict access
to Medicaid. That is the agenda. Find a
way to cut the funding, to deny expan-
sion after the voters approved it.
We now have two members of the Fi-
nance Committee with a long, long his-
tory of advocating for vulnerable peo-
ple facing health challenges, so I am
going to close and just say this: Ever
since I was director of the senior citi-
zens—the Gray Panthers—I always said
that the single most important issue in
America is healthcare. Whether it is
North Dakota or Michigan or Mary-
land, if you and your loved ones don’t
have your health, everything else pret-
ty much goes by the board. Somehow
that message has not gotten through to
the majority here in the Senate be-
cause under this majority and under
the Trump administration’s healthcare
agenda, they are buying into a com-
pletely different set of principles. They
are willing to set millions of Ameri-
cans back with respect to their
healthcare needs. On this side of the
aisle, we are going to keep fighting to
protect Medicaid.
As I indicated, our next two speakers
have a long track record of advocating
for the vulnerable. I am just going to
make a unanimous consent request.
Senator CARDIN has been very patient
with respect to waiting to speak.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank
Senator WYDEN for his extraordinary
leadership on the Senate Finance Com-
mittee as our ranking Democratic
member, who recognizes the impor-
tance of healthcare. To Senator CASEY,
who has been our companion in regard
to Medicaid, in regard to children, and
in regard to the basic importance of
healthcare as a matter of right, to Sen-
ator STABENOW, who has really led our
efforts on behavioral health, incredible
efforts that have been made to provide
community services, particularly to
those who are most vulnerable, we rec-
ognize the importance of moving for-
ward and advancing healthcare for all
Americans. That is why we are taking
this time to express our real concern
about President Trump’s proposal, his
budget proposals, which would cut
Medicaid by $1.5 trillion, the effort to
repeal the Medicaid expansion that we
saw under the Affordable Care Act, the
thought of turning Medicaid at the
Federal level into a block grant, cap-
ping our participation and putting the
burdens on our States.
It is a direct attack on vulnerable
Americans, jeopardizing their access to
healthcare. There are 70 million Ameri-
cans that depend on Medicaid. There
are 1.2 million Americans who are vet-
erans and who are women, children,
and seniors.
In Maryland, almost half of our Med-
icaid population are children. For sen-
iors, one out of every five Medicare-eli-
gible beneficiaries also needs Medicaid.
They are dual eligible. And 60 percent
of the adult Medicaid enrollees are
workers, and 70 percent are from com-
munities of color.
Medicaid expansion has made a big
difference in access to healthcare. It
has reduced health inequalities. The
uninsured rate in the State of Mary-
land has dropped from 10.2 percent to
6.6 percent. That is important not just
for the individuals who now have
health coverage. It stops the cost shift-
ing and the distortions in our
healthcare system with people who do
not have health insurance.
If we were to eliminate Medicaid ex-
pansion, 289,000 Marylanders would lose
their coverage—the essential health
coverage that it provides for our chil-
dren in the early periodic screening
and diagnostic treatment so that we
can help children live healthier lives
through correction of healthcare prob-
lems and prevention of more serious
healthcare issues.
As Senator WYDEN pointed out, in
long-term care, three out of five of our

June 12, 2019
residents in nursing-type, long-term
care facilities are Medicaid payments.
It would be devastating with that type
of cut on their long-term care needs.
We made major advancements in
Medicaid on covering behavioral health
and addiction. One out of every three
individuals who are part of Medicaid
expansion have a behavioral health
issue. The opioid crisis is well known
to all of us. We know that part of the
solution is getting people help and
treatment through Medicaid expansion
and the Medicaid Program providing
that safety net to millions of Ameri-
cans.
The expansion of dental services is
something I have been engaged in ever
since the tragedy in 2007 in my State,
when a youngster died from lack of ac-
cess to dental care, Deamonte Driver.
Medicaid is a lifeline for dental serv-
ices.
So in the United States of America,
the wealthiest Nation in the world,
healthcare should be a right, not a
privilege. We made progress in the Af-
fordable Care Act. Let us build on that
success but not move in the wrong di-
rection. Rather than cutting Medicaid,
we should be looking at ways to work
together to improve coverage and af-
fordability. Rather than eliminating
the Medicaid expansion, we should be
looking at additional ways to cover
those who have no health coverage or
inadequate health coverage. Rather
than limiting the Federal program as
part of Medicaid for our States, we
should be looking at ways to strength-
en the Federal-State partnership so
that we work together so that every
American has access to affordable,
quality care.
I urge my colleagues that that should
be our goal. Let’s work together.
Again, I thank Senator CASEY for
bringing us here today under this issue.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan.
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I
was looking to my colleagues because I
think we all understand and are trying
to accommodate each other’s schedules
and have the opportunity to speak on
the floor. So I appreciate the oppor-
tunity to say a few words. I first thank
Senator CASEY for organizing this very
important discussion on the floor, and
Senator CARDIN and Senator WYDEN for
their passion, and I want to join them
in speaking out about protecting Med-
icaid.
We are talking about people, the ma-
jority in nursing homes. We have three
out of five seniors in Michigan who
have nursing home care and get that
through Medicaid, which is critically
important, as well as children and fam-
ilies. So I want to lend my support to
them, and then I wish to expand the
talk about another very important
piece of healthcare and how we bring
down costs for people.
I have always believed that
healthcare is a basic human right and
everyone should be able to afford the
medicines they need. We have seniors
in nursing homes that are there. We
talked about Medicaid. In fact, they
are more likely than not going to be
involved in needing prescription drugs,
some kind of medicines, and I am deep-
ly concerned that people are not able
to get their medications at a price they
can afford to get what they need. Un-
fortunately, that is certainly hap-
pening in Michigan right now.
As we know, over the past decade or
so, the costs of medications have really
skyrocketed. It is actually shocking to
see the numbers going up. Between 2008
and 2016, prices on the most popular
brand-name drugs have gone up over
208 percent. I know that in Michigan
most people’s salaries haven’t gone up
208 percent. And if someone is living on
a pension or Social Security, that cer-
tainly hasn’t gone up 208 percent.
So these are huge increases. And ac-
cording to AARP, the average price of
brand-name drugs that seniors often
take rose at four times the rate of in-
flation just in 2017—four times the rate
of inflation. So even if you are getting
a small little increase, an inflationary
increase in your salary or in a pension,
your medicines could have gone up four
times higher.
I hear from seniors all over Michigan
about what a struggle this is. I know
we all hear this. Some people are
forced to cut back on other necessities,
like groceries or paying their bills.
Others cut their pills in half or skip
doses. You know, this has gone on and
on for too long. Some folks stop filling
their prescriptions altogether, risking
their health.
Suzanne lives in Howell, MI. She
takes several medications, including
insulin, and she shared her story with
me. Unfortunately, for Suzanne, the
price for insulin has gone from $21 a
month to $278 a month to $410 a
month—the same medicine. The same
medicine was $21 a month and now is
up to $410 a month.
Suzanne isn’t alone. In fact, insulin
prices overall have tripled in the past
15 years, and let me just add that insu-
lin was discovered over 100 years ago
by two Canadian doctors who felt they
should not be reimbursed for their pat-
ent because this discovery was so im-
portant for changing people’s lives and
the quality of their lives. They actu-
ally gave the patent to the University
of Toronto for three Canadian dollars
over 100 years ago, and yet we are now
seeing the price triple just in the past
15 years.
This places a real burden on people
with diabetes and their families.
Suzanne said this:
I don’t even take the amount that I’m sup-
posed to take. . . . We can’t put money into
our retirement. My husband has to work past
[retirement age] because we can’t afford to
live.
She added:
This is a life or death drug. I have to have
this drug to live.
Suzanne doesn’t take insulin because
she wants to. She takes insulin because
she will die without it. Nobody should
be forced to risk their health or their
life by cutting back on the medications
they need to survive.
Unfortunately, the pricing of pre-
scription drugs in this country is the
ultimate example of a rigged system.
In 2018, there were 1,451 lobbyists for
the pharmaceutical and health product
industry. That is almost 15 lobbyists
for every Member of the Senate. Their
job is to stop competition and keep
prices high. Our job is to unrig that
system and bring prices down. The No.
1 way we can bring prices down is to let
Medicare negotiate.
Currently, Medicare is prohibited, as
we know, from harnessing the bar-
gaining power of 43 million seniors in
America to bring down prescription
drug costs. Why aren’t we harnessing
the market price through negotiation?
That doesn’t make any sense.
When Medicare part D became law in
2003, that language was put in there to
stop negotiation. It didn’t make sense
in 2003, and it doesn’t make sense
today.
We know negotiation can work be-
cause it works for the VA, or the Vet-
erans’ Administration. The Veterans’
Administration negotiates prices, and
they save about 40 percent compared to
Medicare. In fact, according to a recent
AARP analysis, Medicare could have
saved $14.4 billion on just 50 drugs—
$14.4 billion on just 50 drugs—if they
had had the same prices as the VA, and
this was in 2016—$14.4 billion.
In 2016, Medicare Part D plans spent
$3 billion on a hepatitis C treatment,
HARVONI. Under VA pricing, that cost
would have been $1.7 billion. These are
differences that are related to real
money coming out of people’s pockets
when they are trying to just put food
on the table and live their lives and be
able to survive in many cases.
Medicare Part D plans spent $1.8 bil-
lion on REVLIMID, which treats mul-
tiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer.
Under VA pricing, Medicare Part D and
American taxpayers could have saved
more than half a billion dollars. Given
the potential for such huge savings, it
is no surprise that the American people
support allowing Medicare to negotiate
drug prices.
I hear it everywhere I go: Why can’t
Medicare just negotiate and get a bet-
ter deal—commonsense?
One recent poll showed that 92 per-
cent of voters support allowing Medi-
care to negotiate with drug companies.
Only Republicans in Congress and
pharma lobbyists are stopping negotia-
tion from moving forward. We need to
change the system and put people be-
fore profits. We need to put people be-
fore profits.
The best way to do that is to allow
Medicare to negotiate with the drug
companies. That could make a big dif-
ference for people like Jack, who lives
in Constantine. Jack was diagnosed
with stage IV prostate cancer late last
year. His oncologist wanted him to
start taking a drug called Zytiga. It

was going to cost an astonishing $15,000
for the first month.
A generic medication had become
available, but after Medicare and sup-
plemental insurance, Jack still would
have to pay $3,400 the first month and
more than $400 each month after that.
In his letter to me, Jack wrote this:
I just retired in June, moving back to
Michigan to be closer to my family, and this
cost . . . is an extreme hardship.
He added:
Getting pharmaceutical companies to re-
duce their price so an average retiree can af-
ford to use them would be a great place to
start. I hope and pray you and your col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle would be
able to get something done so people who
need the medication that they need to thrive
and survive are able to get it.
Jack is right. He and Suzanne and
other people like them across Michigan
and across the country deserve better
than what is happening right now. I
could go on, and I will not, through
price after price after price. The re-
ality is prices are too high. We pay the
highest prices in the world. Every
other country gets involved in negoti-
ating prices on behalf of their citizens.
The drug companies told me at a
hearing that they make a profit in
every other country but they make
more here. They charge more here.
Why? Because they can.
So it is time for us to work together
to allow Medicare to negotiate drug
prices and put people before profits.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia.
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I stood
before this body on December 11, ex-
actly 6 months ago, to discuss what I
called then ‘‘an escalating crisis on our
southwest border.’’ Well, 6 months
later, I don’t think this is a subject for
debate anymore. Not only is this a cri-
sis, but it is one that has escalated and
continues to do so. Congress must take
action or I feel it will come to deeply
regret our inaction.
When I called it a crisis in December,
50,000 migrants had been apprehended
crossing our southwest border during
the previous month of November. It is
now June, 6 months later, and we are
looking at the numbers for May that
approach over 133,000 apprehensions—
the highest 1-month total in 13 years.
In 6 short months, the numbers of en-
counters on the border have increased
by more than 156 percent. Over the past
12 months, the number has increased
by more than 229 percent. Those are
staggering figures.
To put this in context for my fellow
West Virginians, in the month of May
alone, the Border Patrol apprehended a
population that is larger than our cap-
ital city, Charleston; Huntington, WV,
our neighbor; and Morgantown, WV,
combined—three of our largest cities in
1 month.
As I said standing at this desk in De-
cember, the flow of people across the
border is not only larger but is also
changing. Twenty years ago, the vast
majority of those crossing our border
illegally were adult men from Mexico.
In fact, in fiscal year 2000, 98 percent of
those people caught at our border were
Mexicans. Under U.S. law, migrants
from Mexico can be immediately re-
turned to Mexico by the Border Patrol,
but today we are seeing families and
not just adults.
Last month, of the over 133,000 peo-
ple, nearly 64 percent of those who
crossed our borders did that as a family
unit, and the vast majority of them are
from other places than Mexico. They
are Guatemalan, Salvadoran, and Hon-
duran. Of the more than 84,000 mem-
bers of family units apprehended by
Border Patrol last month, only 547, less
than 1 percent, were from Mexico.
So unlike folks from Mexico, these
folks who are coming cannot be sent
home immediately under U.S. law.
They remain in our country often for
months or years as their cases work
their way through the system.
To summarize, today we have signifi-
cantly more people crossing our south-
ern border, and because of who they
are, whom they are traveling with, and
where they are traveling from, each of
these individuals causes us to have a
more significant strain on our system.
Our system makes it advantageous for
migrants from places other than Mex-
ico to cross the border with children.
So more people than ever are making
absolutely sure they are accompanied
by a child on their long and often very
dangerous journey from those places
through Mexico.
All of these factors I have discussed
have completely overwhelmed our sys-
tem. Everybody in this Chamber ought
to believe that and know it is true.
Conditions at Border Patrol stations
that were never intended to be used as
migrant shelters are stunning. These
facilities are bursting at the seams,
and our Border Patrol agents are
spending more time caring for these
migrants than they are patrolling our
border, which is their core function. At
any given time these days, somewhere
close to 20,000 individuals are being
housed in Customs and Border Protec-
tion facilities not at all conducive to
extended stays. In other words, these
facilities were not meant for long
stays.
People are upset. It is unsettling see-
ing pictures of people sleeping on con-
crete floors under Mylar blankets. I
have been to these facilities and, yes, it
is heartbreaking to see, but when drug
lords are dropping off busloads of mi-
grants in secluded parts of our south-
west border, where there is virtually no
infrastructure, there is not much to be
done to improve the situation, unless
we provide the resources to deal with
this crisis.
So what is happening? In the last 51⁄2
months, more than 22,000 family units
that crossed our border illegally have
been released into the United States—
often without any place to go—and told
to come back when their case comes
up, which could be years. I am encour-
aged by the President, and I am very
supportive of the President’s plan and
his administration’s, where they suc-
cessfully negotiated an agreement with
Mexico that will lead to more migrants
waiting outside the United States
while their asylum claims are being
processed. I believe the agreement will
improve the situation on the southern
border when it is fully implemented.
While we have to work to improve
the situation going forward, we have to
address the problem we have right here
today. I am the chairman of the Appro-
priations Subcommittee on Homeland
Security. I must repeat to this body
what I repeated here before, 6 months
ago. We do not have a choice. We do
not have a choice, but we must get this
emergency supplemental done. It is the
only choice we have from a humani-
tarian perspective. It is the only choice
we have from a border security per-
spective.
If we fail, the Department of Home-
land Security will be faced with even
more difficult choices. It will either
have to stop their efforts to improve
these horrible conditions on our border
or it will have to raid other agencies
that are vital to our national security.
I don’t want to see that happen.
There was a very robust debate a few
months ago about the crisis on our bor-
der. Was it real or was it manufac-
tured? I stood here 6 months ago and
said it is real and, quite frankly, I
don’t hear that topic up for debate
much anymore. I think we all know it
is real. It is tragic, but we can do some-
thing about it.
The New York Times, no less, is now
deciding the situation is ‘‘a night-
mare’’ and is imploring Congress to
stop ignoring this crisis.
It was 103 degrees this past weekend
at one of our entry points at McAllen,
TX, which is the epicenter of this cri-
sis. We know it is only June, and it is
only going to get hotter. I hate to see
what the situation will look like this
summer if we fail to act.
I will end with this. The men and
women of the Department of Homeland
Security who work our border and are
trying to process this influx of people
are doing incredibly tremendous work.
It is stressful, it is hard, and in many
cases it is not the mission they signed
up for when they joined the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, but they
have stepped up to address a national
need, and it is past time that we
stepped up for them and for these chil-
dren and these families in need.
Thank you.

TAX REFORM
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, there are
a lots of things we know about Amer-
ican workers today; that is, that work-
ers understand that they are working
harder than ever and have less to show
for it. Productivity is up. Stock prices
are soaring. Executive compensation
has gone through the roof. Profits are
up, but wages are largely flat. It is not

a coincidence, not an accident of the
market. It is not an inevitable result of
capitalism that compensation for ex-
ecutives just vaults skyward, that prof-
its are up, and that stock prices are up
and wages are flat. Capitalism doesn’t
have to be that way. It is just the way
it is now.
Wall Street’s laser focus on accumu-
lated wealth for people who already
have great wealth is by their explicit
design. It comes at the direct expense
of American workers. That is why I am
laying out the case for how Wall Street
undermines workers and some of the
changes we need to make in this coun-
try to grow our middle class and make
hard work pay off.
Each installment of this series, what
we are calling ‘‘Wall Street’s War on
Workers,’’ is posted on my media page.
You can follow along at
www.medium.com/@SenatorBrown.
I have talked about how Wall
Street’s business model encourages
companies to pay workers low wages
and to lay off workers. It is the cost of
doing business to minimize the expense
of workers. Today I want to talk about
how corporations use stock buybacks
to withhold profits from workers who
create them. The workers create this
value, these profits and, instead, Wall
Street and these corporations keep
more and more profits for their CEOs
and for Wall Street investors.
Corporations focus on the short-term
performance on the stock market, not
the long-term success of their company
and its workers. Their main goal be-
comes increasing stock prices quarter-
to-quarter. That is how CEO’s perform-
ances are evaluated. They are not
thinking 10 years down the road. They
are certainly not thinking of their
country or community or even long-
term of their company. They are think-
ing about stock prices quarter-to-quar-
ter. That is how their performance is
evaluated. They are compensated, in
large part, with company shares.
Increasingly, corporations juice
those stock prices by repurchasing
their own stock—what we call a stock
buyback. Because there are a finite
number of company shares at any
given time, purchasing shares will de-
crease the number of shares available
to investors and therefore drive up the
value of the remaining shares. Existing
stockholders will see their stock value
increase. Lo and behold, who are those
existing shareholders? Many of them
owning great numbers of shares are—
shocking—the executives of the compa-
nies.
They offer an even more attractive
option to executives than dividends be-
cause buybacks are more flexible, and
they aren’t taxed until the shares are
sold.
Stock buybacks have been a way for
companies to return cash to share-
holders rather than investing in work-
ers, rather than investing in new prod-
ucts since at least the 1980s, but since
the past decade or so, the amount cor-
porations are spending on buybacks
has dramatically increased. Between
2010 and 2017, corporations spent more
than $3 trillion on stock buybacks.
How much is that? Three trillion is
3,000 billion.
You all remember last year down this
hall, as I pointed out before, where
Senator MCCONNELL works, the major-
ity leader’s office, lobbyists were going
in and out of there writing the tax bill
a year and a half ago. We had that dis-
cussion a number of times. Last year,
following President Trump’s tax give-
away to corporations, that tax bill that
was written down the hall in the lead-
er’s office, 75 percent of the benefits of
that tax bill went to the richest 1 per-
cent.
Last year, following President
Trump’s tax giveaway to corporations,
companies spent $1.5 million every
minute of every day on stock
buybacks. Since that bill passed—that
giveaway to the richest people in this
country—companies have spent $1.5
million every minute of every day on
stock buybacks.
A couple of years ago, Home Depot
spent 99 percent of its net-net income
on stock buybacks; IBM spent 92 per-
cent. Think about that—99 percent and
92 percent of its income spent on stock
buybacks. That is not money going to
a $14-an-hour worker at that company.
That is not money going to reinvest in
equipment or building the company or
research. Ninety-nine cents on the dol-
lar is going to stock buybacks to en-
rich the biggest—not the small-time
investors, to enrich the biggest inves-
tors. Companies are spending close to
100 percent of their profits on that—not
on wages, not on other things.
Do you know what? When all this was
going on back when this tax bill was
written—and I remember opening this
door and pointing down the hall to
Senator MCCONNELL’s office—around
that time, President Trump invited
some Senators of both parties to the
White House. He promised us that
every American would get at least a
$4,000 raise; some would get a $9,000
raise. Do you know what happened? I
know the President figured out he
wasn’t really telling the truth. He was
doing his typical exaggeration.
When he said every American would
get a $4,000 pay increase, at least, that
money didn’t go to wage increases. In
those two companies, more than 90 per-
cent of it went to stock buybacks. It
went to increases in salaries and wages
but only to the top executives. Don’t
even try to tell us that these tax cuts
for the rich trickle down to middle-in-
come workers or trickle down to mid-
dle-income Americans. They simply
don’t.
Buybacks jumped even more after
President Trump signed that bill. More
money was spent on stock buybacks in
2018 than on debt payment, capital ex-
penditures, research and development,
on dividends.
Virtually almost every Republican
voted for that tax bill. Don’t try to
come here, my friends on the other side
of the aisle, and say we are going to
vote for this huge tax cut for rich peo-
ple—this bill written down the hall in
Senator MCCONNELL’s office—we are
going to vote for a bill to give big tax
cuts to rich people, and that money is
going to work its way down to help the
middle class. Don’t even bother trying
to lie to us and tell us that. That never
happens.
Proponents of stock buybacks argue
that companies purchase their own
shares only after considering other
value-creating investment options.
There is not a lot of consideration of
other options when more than 90 cents
on the dollar is spent on stock
buybacks. They expect us to believe
America is truly out of ideas. Are all
our factories as updated as they can
be? Are all workers earning a fair wage
they can live on? Of course not.
Talk to any family in Cleveland,
where I live now; or Lorraine, where I
lived before; Mansfield, where I grew
up; or Chillicothe; or Marietta. Talk to
anyone outside of Wall Street or the
richest enclaves of this country. Ask
these families if they can think of a
better investment for the trillions of
dollars in wealth American workers
have created.
It doesn’t have to be this way. The
Tax Code is one of the best tools we
have to influence businesses. Tax re-
form should have been an opportunity
for companies to encourage people to
invest more in workers.
When I went to the White House in
that meeting with President Trump, I
gave him a couple of ideas. I actually
handed him legislation. I handed him
the Patriot Corporation Act. Do you
know what that bill does? It doesn’t
just give tax breaks to the big cor-
porate lobbyists who come in and out
of Senator MCCONNELL’s office. The Pa-
triot Corporation Act says that if your
company pays good wages, if your com-
pany provides decent benefits for
health and retirement, if your com-
pany makes your product in the United
States of America, you get a lower tax
rate.
A comparable bill, the freeloader fee
bill, says that if you, on the other
hand, are a company where a huge
number of your workers receive Med-
icaid because you don’t provide health
insurance, a huge number of your
workers get food stamps because you
don’t pay high enough wages, and a
huge number of your workers get sec-
tion 8 housing tax credits, you pay a
corporate freeloader fee. That corpora-
tion is penalized.
If the company does the right thing,
they should have a lower tax break. If
a company depends on American tax-
payers to subsidize their low-wage em-
ployees, that company should be penal-
ized. It is as simple as that.
The President said he liked these
ideas, but then the special interests
came funneling into Senator MCCON-
NELL’s office, lining up out in the hall
as far as you can see. They were going

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3356 June 12, 2019
into the office petitioning, asking, beg-
ging, pleading for the majority leader
to take care of them, and he did.
If we started corporate tax reform
with the Patriot Corporation Act, we
would have seen rising wages. Instead,
we see exploding stock buybacks.
Again, we know why. Depending on the
size of the companies, stocks can ac-
count for as much as half of an execu-
tive’s compensation. An executives’
personal interest influences decision
making.
One study of 2,500 companies found
that the greater the percentage stock
options in executive compensation
packages, the more likely a company
was to do stock buybacks. No kidding.
If I am a CEO, and I see that my com-
pensation depends on stock buybacks, I
am going to maybe cash in and do
stock buybacks. That is at least what
we have seen.
We shouldn’t be surprised that when
the President and Leader MCCONNELL
handed them a windfall, those execu-
tives turned around, plowed their
money right back into stock buybacks
and into their own pockets.
A good example of that is really close
to home for me. It is what happened to
General Motors. General Motors pays
almost no taxes anyway. It is a profit-
able corporation. Ten years ago, in this
Senate, I was proud of what I did. I
worked with Senator Voinovich, Re-
publican from Ohio; I worked with
President Bush, the second; and
worked with President Obama in sav-
ing those two plant companies, Chrys-
ler and GM. It meant that a lot of
Ohioans and a lot of people around the
country continued to have decent jobs.
What happened 10 years later? They
closed their plants. They do major
stock buybacks. The executives get
richer, and because of this Trump tax
law, more production goes to Mexico.
How do we stop this never-ending
cycle of corporate greed and make sure
the workers share the profits they cre-
ated? It may not seem like it, but there
are already regulations in place to pre-
vent stock price manipulation.
The problem is, the SEC rule put in
place in 1982 has big loopholes. We need
to strengthen the SEC rules to ban
buybacks and provide more trans-
parency.
Some have suggested we ban
buybacks altogether. That might sound
good, but it will not do anything to put
that money in the pockets of workers
where it belongs. The goal is not to tax
the rich. The goal is to quit giving
them tax breaks, and the goal is to
plow money into the middle class, to
help American workers get their fair
share, to help American workers share
in the wealth they create for corporate
America.
My proposal is simple. If corpora-
tions want to transfer wealth to Wall
Street, workers simply get a propor-
tionate share of the pie. For every $1
million passed on to shareholders in
the form of stock buybacks or divi-
dends, corporations will have to pass
on $1 to every worker in that company.
I am calling it a worker dividend, and
all public corporations would be re-
quired to pay it.
I will be introducing legislation to
strengthen SEC rules and to establish
the worker dividend in the coming
weeks. It simply comes back to the dig-
nity of work. We should honor work.
We should respect work. It means bet-
ter wages. It means retirement bene-
fits. It means healthcare. It means
more control over your work schedule.
It means a safe workplace. It means
childcare. It means all the values that
we appreciate as Americans. With the
dignity of work and respecting and
honoring work, we would see a worker
dividend.
Wall Street so often doesn’t recog-
nize that all work has dignity. Whether
you swipe a badge or punch a clock,
whether you work for tips, whether you
work on salary, whether you are caring
for an aging parent, whether you are
raising your children, all work has dig-
nity. Dr. King said there is no job that
is menial if it has adequate compensa-
tion.
Wall Street considers shareholders’
equity in a company to be all that mat-
ters. Workers have equity in a com-
pany too. It is called sweat equity. For
the first time in years in this country,
it is time that workers are rewarded
for their work.
I yield the floor.

ELECTION SECURITY
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, we
are 8 months away from the first pri-
mary of the 2020 election. There is a
false belief that the 2020 election is a
year and a half away when it is 8
months away.
In his May 29 speech, Robert Mueller
made the statement that there were
multiple systematic efforts to interfere
in our election. That allegation de-
serves the attention of every Amer-
ican. FBI Director Chris Wray made
the statement that the 2018 election
was a dress rehearsal for the big show.
There are a few statements that we
can argue about in this body. I find ab-
solutely no one arguing in this body
that the Russians didn’t try to inter-
fere in our election of 2016. If you go all
the way back in history to 2012, the
Russians actively engaged in the
Ukrainian election. In that election,
they found multiple ways to interfere
and to change the stories on social
media. They found multiple ways to
interfere in their election internally.
That interference in 2012 was their
practice run for what they launched on
the United States in 2016.
It is not just against us. The Russian
Federation has attacked every single
NATO country’s election—every one of
them. It just happened to come to us
last. I have no doubt that this will not
be the last time the Russians will try
to interfere in our elections.
As I walk through the entire first
section of it over and over again, what
is clear from the Mueller report is they
repeat what they have found and how
they went through the process of what
the Russians were trying to do in work-
ing with social media entities to try to
create fake American accounts in order
to put out fake information online and
in trying to find as many different
places as they could in order to put out
stories to create confusion and chaos.
I have had multiple folks back in my
State who have asked me, why would
the Russians do this? It is because the
Russians cannot match us militarily,
economically, or culturally, so they
use alternative ways of doing warfare.
For them, their favorite type is just
stirring up chaos. They look for every
time Americans or any free democracy
argues with another, and when they
find democracies arguing with each
other, they reach in and take both
sides and try to elevate the arguments.
Basically, what I have told folks at
home is that it is like two kids on the
playground who are fighting. There is
always a third kid on the edge of the
playground who screams ‘‘fight, fight,
fight’’ in trying to get as many people
as possible to come to the fight. Well,
the Russians are that other kid on the
playground. They are not actually one
of the kids fighting; they are just try-
ing to make it louder and bigger.
The Russians have actively engaged
in trying to stir up any kind of con-
troversy, and elections are just one
place in which a democracy has con-
troversy. They stir up controversy just
as much anywhere else they find it, but
it is easier at election time when
Americans are making decisions and
taking sides on their own. They do this
on social media, but we also know from
the Senate Intelligence Committee and
its excellent work in its bipartisan
process, as well as from the Mueller re-
port, of what they were trying to do in
their reaching into election systems.
There were 21 States that had their
elections systems probed by the Rus-
sians. That means, electronically, the
Russians went in to see if the doors
were locked. If they found that a door
was locked and they couldn’t easily get
into the system, they would move on
to another State and see if they could
find a way to get into its system. The
good news in this process is that the
Russians were not able to get into a
single election as far as their affecting
any of the votes.
Through all of the investigations
from every single State, from an intel-
ligence investigation, from our intel-
ligence community and its investiga-
tions, from the FBI and its work, and
from the Mueller report, there were no
votes that were changed. We know
that. We also know that the Russians
were looking and what they were try-
ing to find. What they did find is access
to voter databases. That tells us, for
the next election, they will be looking
to see if they can get to that again.
This is the lesson we need to learn
from this as they do their
spearfishing—as they reach out to dif-
ferent election systems.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3357
June 12, 2019
Here is what I think we can do in the
days ahead and what we can have as
our basic findings. As a nation, we need
to be prepared for this. There are a
couple of ways we can do it, and we
have made very clear proposals in
order to take this on.
We need to give security clearances
to each and every State so that if we
discover something on the Federal side
and if anyone in the intelligence com-
munity identifies there is a problem,
one can rapidly get to a State and ask,
are you aware of this? That was not
present in 2016. We didn’t have points
of contact between the Department of
Homeland Security and every secretary
of state in each State so they could
also maintain rapid security, not only
just normal communication but at the
classified level as well.
We need the DHS to voluntarily en-
gage with every single State and ask,
would you like an additional layer of
cyber protection? I can’t imagine a
State would not choose to add an addi-
tional layer on top of its existing cyber
protection.
We also need to encourage States to
be attentive to any vulnerabilities they
have in their election systems. This is
not something we can do at the Federal
level. At the Federal level, we don’t
tell States and counties and precincts
how they should do their elections;
that is a State’s unique responsibility.
We have a different election system
in Oklahoma than what they have in
Louisiana and in Texas and in Kansas.
Although there are border States right
around us, you would think we would
all share and do it exactly the same,
but we don’t. That is actually a
strength of our system. The Russians
can’t get into one system, hack into it,
and then get into our entire election
system, because States do it differently
across the country. Yet we do need to
be attentive if any State has a vulner-
able system.
Right now, the greatest challenge we
have is with the States that actually
use paperless voting systems, for there
is no way to verify the accuracy of
those votes. If all of the votes are done
electronically—and there are States
that don’t do it, like mine. We don’t do
it that way, but some States do. In
fact, there are five States that do it
that way. You are basically walking up
to an iPad, pushing different buttons,
and then walking away. That all looks
very clean, and there is no threat like
there was in 2000 of hanging chads be-
cause you can see it there. The problem
is, if there were a problem with that
software, there would be no way to
verify that vote.
In my State, you mark on a paper
ballot, and you run it through an opti-
cal scan. At the end of election day,
they count up all of the things from
the optical scan, and the paper ballots
are secured away. If there is a question
about a machine and its count, we can
go back and verify it.
In other States, they have systems
that are very similar to that of an iPad
in which you can kind of push your
way through the buttons on it, do it all
electronically, and look at it. When
you decide ‘‘this is exactly how I
voted’’ and you push the final button,
it prints a paper receipt, basically, that
is kept there. Then you can verify how
you voted on the paper, which is stored
on the machine, and you can also look
at it electronically. It is very clean and
very easy. There are other places that
only use paper and count it all by hand
because they are in the rural areas.
Any of those systems work. There is
no reason for the Federal Government
to tell each State how to do its local
elections, but we do need to encourage
those States to have systems that
allow them to go back and audit and
verify. We don’t need to have anything
at the end of election day that makes
Americans doubt the strength of our
democracy or the capability of our de-
mocracy to hold an election.
So here are the basic recommenda-
tions that are coming from the Senate
Intelligence Committee and with which
I will concur:
States should continue to run elec-
tions. We do not need to federalize
elections, and we do not need to re-
quire that there be Federal certifi-
cations for election machines. There is
no reason to play Mother May I? with
someone in Washington, DC, on how it
works. States need to run their elec-
tions, but the Federal Government
should always be there to assist States
and to say: If you have a question or if
you want a second opinion, we can
offer that.
The DHS should continue to create
clear channels of communication be-
tween the Federal Government and ap-
propriate officials at the State and
local levels. Again, in 2016, when Jeh
Johnson contacted State officials and
said there was a problem with the elec-
tion that was coming, State election
officials pushed him away and said: We
don’t know who you are, and we don’t
know why you are calling us. We can’t
ever have that again.
The DHS should expedite security
clearances for appropriate State and
local officials.
The intelligence community should
work to declassify information quick-
ly. The last time the warnings came
out about the Russian engagement in
our election, it took over a year for
States to learn that it was the Rus-
sians who had been trying to reach into
their systems. That can never happen
again.
On a national level, we should create
voluntary guidelines on cyber security,
best practices for public awareness
campaigns, promote election security
awareness, and work through the U.S.
Election Assistance Commission, the
National Association of Secretaries of
State, and the National Association of
State Election Directors. All of them
have a role. We should have active
communication among each other and
among the DHS. States should also
rapidly replace outdated, vulnerable
election systems.
I have had some folks say to me: Do
you know what? Those five States that
don’t have auditable systems are going
to need Federal assistance because it is
going to be expensive. That seems like
a great argument unless you look at
the 45 other States that have figured
out how to do it without Federal as-
sistance. This argument that it is
going to take $1 billion to help those
last five States do what the other 45
States have found a way to do without
Federal assistance just doesn’t wash
with me. Those five States can do the
same thing that the other 45 States
have done and have auditable, efficient
election systems.
We don’t want Russia, Iran, or North
Korea to tamper with our elections in
2020 or, for that matter, for there to be
any domestic interference. We need to
be able to prove the accuracy of our
elections, and it shouldn’t be a chal-
lenge for us in the days ahead. We are
8 months away from these elections,
and we need to complete what we have
started.
I do need to mention one thing. I am
exceptionally proud of the DHS and the
work it did in 2018. There were no
grand stories about election problems
in 2018 because the DHS officials
worked tirelessly to help States and
walk alongside them. State secretaries
of state and local volunteers all around
the country worked exceptionally hard
to pay attention to the election issues.
We cannot stop focusing on that. We
need to be aware that the Russians
don’t just do it once; they do it over
and over again, as every one of our Eu-
ropean allies can tell us. They will
keep coming with misinformation, and
they will keep coming to try to desta-
bilize. We, as well, can be clear and
push back on this in the days ahead.
I have a bill called the Secure Elec-
tions Act, which we worked on for a
couple of years, that answers all of
these questions, and I look forward to
its passage. In the meantime, I am
grateful that those at the DHS are pay-
ing attention to this, and I encourage
them to continue to not only consider
these recommendations but to apply
them.
I yield the floor.

trality. What is net neutrality? The
principles are simple. Internet service
providers should be required to treat
all internet content and traffic equally.
They should not be able to block access
to websites, to reduce the speeds at
which consumers browse the internet,
or charge consumers more based on the
types of websites they are visiting.
The Trump administration believes
that companies should be able to freely
block or slow down consumers’ access
to the internet in the interest of higher
profits. My Democratic colleagues and
I believe that all content should be
treated equally, and corporate finan-
cial interests should not be more im-
portant than protecting American con-
sumers.
The fact is that most Americans
agree with us. The decision to rollback
net neutrality was unpopular a year
ago, and it remains unpopular today.
In March of 2019, a poll conducted by
tech research firm, Comparitech, found
that four in five Americans support net
neutrality.
Make no mistake, at times, it seems
like we are living in one of the most
partisan times in our Nation’s history,
but on the topic of net neutrality, 86
percent of Democrats, 79 percent of
Independents, and 77 percent of Repub-
licans support protecting a free and
open internet for American consumers.
Now more than ever, constituents are
engaging with the issues of the day and
are willing to let their elected officials
know their views on what is important
to them. I can tell you that, of the
physical mail and emails my office re-
ceives, net neutrality has been one of
the most important issues to Illi-
noisans. Since January 20, 2017, my of-
fice has received almost 200,000 letters
on the topic of net neutrality, and by a
mile, constituents are in support of the
principles of net neutrality and want
to reverse the action taken by the FCC.
I have got news for you: the Members
of the House have heard their constitu-
ents loud and clear. Two months ago,
the House passed the Save the Internet
Act that would reaffirm the govern-
ment’s commitment to net neutrality
and prevent major corporations from
slowing down, blocking access to, or
charging more for certain websites.
When this bill arrived in the Senate,
what have we chosen to do? A measure
containing principles that 77 percent of
Republicans support and received bi-
partisan support last Congress? Not a
thing.
Leader MCCONNELL and Republicans
have instead proceeded to turn the
Senate into a legislative graveyard.
They have prioritized doling out life-
time appointments to our Federal
courts while refusing to take action on
many of our Nation’s pressing most
issues, including demonstrating a com-
mitment to upholding a free and open
internet.

REMEMBERING MOLLY HOLT
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I
wish to recognize the passing of Molly
Holt. Known affectionately as the
Mother of All Korea’s Orphans, Molly
Holt dedicated her life to advocating
for disabled, often homeless, children
and adults in South Korea. Born to
international adoption pioneers Bertha
and Harry Holt, Molly carried the fam-
ily legacy with a steadfast dedication
to serving those less fortunate.
Molly first traveled to South Korea
as a young nursing graduate, eager to
assist her father as he attempted to
provide care for the many children left
orphaned by the Korean war. She spent
most of her life working tirelessly with
the residents of the Holt Ilsan Center
in Korea, a long-term care facility for
children and adults who have special
physical, medical, or mental needs.
Molly was a champion for the children
at the Holt Ilsan Center, who affection-
ately referred to her as Unnie or big
sister. It was through her steadfast ad-
vocacy that many children housed at
the center were able to find permanent,
loving homes.
Molly Holt will be remembered as an
exceptional Oregonian, a woman who
was guided by her strong convictions
towards a life of charity and compas-
sion. Even in the face of a debilitating
illness, Molly remained committed to
serving the people that she loved with
her whole heart. Her passing is a loss
that will be felt across the world, but
her legacy of earnest, passionate serv-
ice will continue to inspire us for dec-
ades to come.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
150TH ANNIVERSARY OF
TANGIPAHOA PARISH
∑ Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, today I
wish to acknowledge the 150th anniver-
sary of the founding of Tangipahoa
Parish in my home State of Louisiana.
It is a parish filled with hard-working
and patriotic citizens who work day in
and day out to better our State and our
Nation.
Tangipahoa Parish is located in the
section of the State known as the Flor-
ida Parishes. The word Tangipahoa
means ‘‘those who gather corn’’ and re-
fers to a sub-Tribe of Native Americans
called the Acolapissa. The parish is 823
square miles, with the Mississippi
State line serving as its northern bor-
der and Lakes Maurepas and Pont-
chartrain at its southern border.
This part of our State is rich with
history. The Natives used this area as
part of a route to travel between Mo-
bile and Pensacola and through Pass
Manchac to Illinois and the Great
Lakes. The Acolapissa Tribe also led
Bienville and Iberville through
Manchac, where they named two near-
by lakes ‘‘Maurepas’’ and ‘‘Pont-
chartrain’’ to honor the French finance
ministers who supported the New
World colony, which Bienville named
New Orleans.
The French and Spanish controlled
their Louisiana territory for some
time. However, the British controlled
the Florida Parishes. The Louisiana
Purchase gave Louisiana to the United
States, but the Florida Parishes were
not a part of the purchase. It was an
international boundary between the
Spanish and the United States until
1812 when Louisiana was named a
State.
In the mid-1800s, the railroad indus-
try brought development into the area.
However, people felt inconvenienced by
the distance they had to travel to con-
duct business in the nearby parishes.
To solve this, citizens carved out their
own parish from the four surrounding
parishes. The boundaries were solidi-
fied by law in 1869, which created
Tangipahoa Parish.
Tangipahoa Parish is home to the
State’s third largest public university,
Southeastern Louisiana University. It
is also known for its many festivals, in-
cluding the Strawberry Festival, the
Sicilian Heritage Festival, the Italian
Festival, and the Oyster Festival. The
pop icon Britney Spears is from the
town of Kentwood, in Tangipahoa Par-
ish.
Happy 150th anniversary to
Tangipahoa Parish. You are etched in
our colorful and rich history. Thank
you for all of your contributions to our
beautiful State that we are fortunate
to call home.∑

June 12, 2019
100TH ANNIVERSARY OF GARFIELD
COUNTY
∑ Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise
today to honor a ranching community,
a community that knows the meaning
and value of hard work and that truly
embodies the spirit of the great state
of Montana.
Garfield County is 100 years old this
year. After splitting from neighboring
Dawson County in 1919, this group of
homesteading pioneers voted to make
Jordan its county seat and get to work
doing what Montanans do best: making
a living off the land.
Ranching is a way of life out here,
one that has sustained families, built
communities, and contributed to Mon-
tana’s rural heritage.
While ranching and agriculture re-
main Garfield’s top industries, the
county is perhaps most well known for
another export: bones.
Garfield County sits atop the Hell’s
Creek Formation. Millions of years be-
fore European settlers built their
homesteads and long before the Assini-
boine and Crow tribes occupied the
land, Garfield County was home to
some of the most fearsome creatures
ever to roam the Earth. Its Tyranno-
saurus rex and Triceratops fossils are
some of the best preserved, and most
renowned, specimens ever discovered.
Rexy, the mighty Tyrannosaurus rex
who now roams the halls of the Natural
History Museum in New York City, was
discovered just north of Jordan, and is
just one example of the paleontological
contribution Garfield County has
made, a reminder of an ancient history
long forgotten and discovered anew.
The good people of Garfield County
have much to be proud of. I rise today
to honor them and to congratulate
them on 100 great years.
I know the next 100 will be even bet-
ter.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and
were referred or ordered to lie on the
table as indicated:
POM–89. A resolution adopted by the House
of Representatives of the State of Michigan
urging the United States Congress to enact
legislation preventing federal regulators
from sanctioning depository institutions for
providing financial services to legitimate
marijuana-related businesses in states where
marijuana has been legalized; to the Com-
mittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Af-
fairs.
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 101
Whereas, The medical and recreational
marijuana industries are continually grow-
ing across states in the country, contrib-
uting billions of dollars to the economy.
Many states have legalized the use of med-
ical and/or recreational marijuana, while ad-
ditional states may do so in the future; and
Whereas, Voters of the state of Michigan
have approved the legalization of regulated
medical and recreational marijuana use; and
Whereas, Marijuana is still illegal under
federal law, creating confusion and uncer-
tainty in banking, taxation, and other mat-
ters. Because of the federal prohibition,
there is an extreme risk to provide financial
services to marijuana-related businesses and
service providers, resulting in a cash-inten-
sive industry. In turn, it is very difficult for
such businesses to accept noncash payments
from customers and make noncash payments
to employees, suppliers, governments, and
others; and
Whereas, The proliferation of cash in the
marijuana industry has given rise to signifi-
cant public safety risks, including in Michi-
gan’s communities. Holding large amounts of
cash heightens the risk of robbery and vio-
lence; and
Whereas, Bringing the marijuana sector
into the traditional financial services sys-
tem is in the interest of the state and its
residents. This development will increase
public safety, grow the economy, and create
jobs. Moreover, it will make transacting
business with, and collecting taxes from, the
marijuana industry easier. The federal gov-
ernment should respect the authority of
Michigan and other states that have enacted
policies concerning marijuana use; and
Whereas, The Secure and Fair Enforcement
(SAFE) Banking Act of 2019 has been intro-
duced in the U.S. House of Representatives
(H.R. 1595) to provide safe harbor from fed-
eral regulators for depository institutions
that provide financial services to marijuana-
related businesses and service providers in
states that exercise jurisdiction over the
marijuana industry. The measure has re-
ceived bipartisan support: Now, therefore, be
it
Resolved by the House of Representatives,
That we urge the U.S. Congress to enact leg-
islation preventing federal regulators from
sanctioning depository institutions for pro-
viding financial services to legitimate mari-
juana-related businesses in states where
marijuana has been legalized; and be it fur-
ther
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be
transmitted to the President of the United
States Senate, the Speaker of the United
States House of Representatives, and the
members of the Michigan congressional dele-
gation.
POM–90. A concurrent memorial adopted
by the Legislature of the State of Arizona
urging the United States Congress to appro-
priate monies and federal entities to develop
solutions to eradicate salt cedars in Arizona
waterways; to the Committee on Environ-
ment and Public Works.
HOUSE CONCURRENT MEMORIAL NO. 2002
Whereas, the salt cedar tree, also known as
the tamarisk, was brought to the United
States in the 1800s as an ornamental plant to
stabilize soil and control erosion; and
Whereas, salt cedars are now listed as an
invasive species by the United States De-
partment of Agriculture; and
Whereas, salt cedars spread prolifically by
both seed and sprouting, congesting thou-
sands of acres of river land in Arizona; and
Whereas, the density of salt cedars creates
dangerous conditions by congesting flood-
prone areas, impeding water flow and exacer-
bating the impact of flooding; and
Whereas, by increasing the frequency and
intensity of wildfires, salt cedars threaten
existing and future infrastructure in sur-
rounding communities; and
Whereas, this invasive plant out-competes
native cottonwood, mesquite and willow and
displaces riparian and other wildlife habitats
by altering the ecology and hydrology of na-
tive systems; and
Whereas, each salt cedar tree consumes 200
to 300 gallons of water a day, which lowers
the water table and creates large deposits of
salt in the soil; and
Whereas, salt cedars negatively impact Ar-
izona’s economy by jeopardizing agriculture
due to high water usage, tending to obstruct
irrigation canals and limiting recreational
opportunities; and
Whereas, eliminating salt cedars will sus-
tain precious water supplies, reduce the risk
of environmental disasters, and minimize
structural and ecological damage and loss of
life.
Wherefore your memorialist, the House of
Representatives of the State of Arizona, the
Senate concurring, prays:
1. That the United States Congress appro-
priate monies to the State of Arizona to
eradicate salt cedars from Arizona water-
ways.
2. That the United States Department of
the Interior and the United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture develop innovative solu-
tions to control the proliferation of salt ce-
dars.
3. That the Secretary of State of the State
of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial
to the President of the United States, the
President of the United States Senate, the
Speaker of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, the Secretary of the United
States Department of the Interior, the Sec-
retary of the United States Department of
Agriculture and each Member of Congress
from the State of Arizona.
POM–91. A resolution adopted by the Coun-
ty Council of Prince George’s County, Mary-
land memorializing its support for additional
oversight of major public private partnership
agreements; to the Committee on Environ-
ment and Public Works.
POM–92. A resolution adopted by the
Mayor and City Commission of the City of
Miami Beach, Florida, urging the United
States Congress to approve S. 788, ‘‘The
Equality Act,’’ which will serve to extend
federal anti-discrimination protections to
lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender
(LGBT) Americans by providing them with
equal protection under the law; to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr.
ISAKSON, and Mr. KING):
S. 1793. A bill to establish a grant
program for the purpose of public
health data system modernization; to
the Committee on Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions.
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, Our Na-
tion’s public health system needs high
quality, timely, and accurate data to
protect the public from health threats
like opioid overdoses, influenza, mea-
sles, and more. Effective prevention
and response to health threats requires
coordinated efforts between health
care providers and public health offi-
cials across all levels of government.
Unfortunately, the public health data
systems we rely on for our health and
safety are antiquated and fragmented.
Systems lack the interoperability
needed to facilitate timely, secure in-
formation exchange. Too often, public
health departments are forced to rely
on systems with manual processes that
are time consuming and error prone,
such as paper records, faxes, and phone
calls. Only two jurisdictions have
begun the process to receive electronic
case reports directly from health
records, and only for a small number of
diseases. Our public health data infra-
structure lacks the automation, secu-
rity, interoperability, and skilled
workforce we need to confront the pub-
lic health threats of today and tomor-
row.
Today, I am pleased to introduce
with my colleagues, Senator ISAKSON
and Senator KING, the Saving Lives
Through Better Data Act to assist in
building the 21st Century public health
data infrastructure our Nation needs.
The Saving Lives Through Better Data
Act awards grants to State, local, Trib-
al, and territorial public health depart-
ments to improve data collection and
analysis, simplify provider reporting,
enhance interoperability, promote
electronic case reporting, and support
earlier disease detection and response.
Grant recipients must support inter-
operability standards endorsed by the
National Coordinator for Health Infor-
mation Technology or those adopted by
the HHS Secretary.
The Saving Lives Through Better
Data Act also requires the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention to con-
duct activities to improve its public
health data systems. The CDC must
also develop and utilize public-private
partnerships to support State, local,
Tribal, and territorial public health de-
partments in modernizing and expand-
ing electronic case reporting and pub-
lic health data systems. The legislation
calls for reporting on barriers public
health authorities may face in imple-
menting electronic case reporting or
interoperable public health data sys-
tems as well as an assessment of the
potential public health impact of mak-
ing such improvements. We make the
necessary investment to improve our
public health infrastructure by author-
izing $100 million per year for each of
fiscal years 2020–2024.
The Saving Lives Through Better
Data Act will strengthen our public
health data systems so we can be well-
equipped to identify and respond to
public health threats, which will save
lives.
By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr.
BOOZMAN, Mr. TESTER, Mr.
TILLIS, and Ms. SINEMA):
S. 1802. A bill to provide a work op-
portunity tax credit for military
spouses and to provide for flexible
spending arrangements for childcare
services for military families; to the
Committee on Finance.
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I
am introducing the Jobs and Childcare
for Military Families Act, with my col-
leagues Senators BOOZMAN and TESTER.
Enacting this bill would improve finan-
cial stability for Gold Star families
across the Nation.
The families of America’s
servicemembers make sacrifices that
often go unrecognized. Among them is
packing up and moving frequently,
with military spouses regularly having
to quit stable employment to move to
a new area and start over. This is com-
pounded by the complex system of
State licensing and certification re-
quirements, which can limit these
spouses’ from taking jobs that utilize
their expertise and experience. Because
of this, military spouses have unem-
ployment rates substantially higher
than the national average, and are
often underemployed when they do
have jobs. Adding to the financial
struggle that frequent periods of unem-
ployment and underemployment cause,
the rising cost of childcare puts a sub-
stantial burden on many military fami-
lies.
The Jobs and Childcare for Military
Families Act would help these families

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3366 June 12, 2019
in two ways. First, the bill makes mili-
tary spouses an eligible population for
the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. This
tax credit has been proven effective in
improving the employment prospects
for other groups, and extending it to
military spouses would help them find
employment easier after moving to
new areas. Second, the bill instructs
the administration to implement de-
pendent care flexible spending ac-
counts for all servicemembers. These
accounts would allow military families
to contribute pre-tax dollars to ac-
counts that they can then use to pay
for childcare services, helping ease the
financial burden of childcare.
I hope my colleagues will support
this bill to help families who have
made the greatest sacrifice for our Na-
tion.
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Ms.
BALDWIN, Mrs. CAPITO, and Mr.
TESTER):
S. 1803. A bill to modify the Federal
TRIO programs; to the Committee on
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise
today to introduce the Educational Op-
portunity and Success Act, a bill to
strengthen the Federal TRIO Programs
and improve their administration.
Across the Nation, TRIO helps students
from disadvantaged backgrounds gain
access to a college education and pro-
vide many of the supports that they
need to prepare for, succeed in, and
graduate from higher education pro-
grams. I would very much like to
thank Senator BALDWIN, Senator
CAPITO, and Senator TESTER for joining
me as original cosponsors.
In the State of Maine, TRIO Pro-
grams serve students from all over our
State and are focused on increasing
educational opportunities for first gen-
eration, low-income, and disabled stu-
dents. From 2007 to 2017, TRIO has ex-
panded from 20 programs to 28 in our
State and has expanded from serving
6,690 students to nearly 7,500 students
in our State. Over the course of my
Senate service, I have been so inspired
by the stories of countless TRIO stu-
dents with whom I have talked. They
have described to me firsthand the
positive impact of these programs on
their academic success and on their fu-
tures.
For example, Autumn Mallet from
Bangor, ME, graduated from Bangor
High School in 2015, unsure about
whether she even wanted to pursue
higher education. Neither she nor her
parents had any experience with higher
education. That is very typical of what
I found in talking with students who
are enrolled in the TRIO Programs. Au-
tumn decided to enroll at Eastern
Maine Community College, where she
connected with TRIO’s Student Sup-
port Services Program. Autumn called
TRIO ‘‘irreplaceable’’ and her ‘‘full
support system.’’ The academic advis-
ers were her ‘‘go-to people’’ when it
came to signing up for classes, finding
tutors, navigating financial aid, and
advocating for herself.
Autumn graduated in May 2018 with
an associate’s degree in liberal studies
and secondary education, and she has
gone on to the University of Maine
where she is currently earning her
bachelor’s degree. At the University,
she also taps into the resources of the
Student Support Services Program.
And, very movingly, Autumn is giving
back to TRIO. She is a TRIO peer men-
tor at Eastern Maine Community Col-
lege, helping students, just like herself,
successfully navigate higher education
and giving them the tools and the con-
fidence to succeed. For Autumn, TRIO
has made all the difference as she has
pursued her own goals and helped other
students achieve theirs.
Congress created the TRIO Programs
because it recognized that low-income,
first-generation students often face sig-
nificant financial and societal obsta-
cles to accessing and achieving success
in higher education. The Educational
Opportunity and Success Act would
better serve those students by imple-
menting key reforms.
First, and most important, our bipar-
tisan bill would reauthorize the TRIO
Programs for an additional 5 years.
Second, our bill would instruct the
Department of Education to publish
guidance at least 90 days before each
grant competition, giving colleges and
universities adequate opportunity to
prepare the successful applications to
secure the funding needed to offer the
TRIO Programs.
Third, our bill would remove the ad-
ministrative burdens in the application
process for these schools, making sure
that Federal funds get out the door
more efficiently and to the programs
and the students they are meant to
serve. Under the current administra-
tive process, many colleges and univer-
sities experience delays while the De-
partment reviews administrative errors
before making all of the grant awards.
This reform would help to expedite the
grant process.
Fourth, our legislation would insti-
tute commonsense guidelines at the
Department of Education for TRIO
grant applications.
Let me tell you what happened in
2017. In that year, the Department ini-
tially rejected dozens of applications
for the Upward Bound Program based
on arbitrary, nonsubstantive for-
matting criteria, such as line spacing
and font size irregularities. This was
bureaucracy at its worst. One of those
applications was from the University of
Maine at Presque Isle, which had been
a longtime recipient of funding to pro-
vide TRIO Programs. Here is what hap-
pened with the University of Maine at
Presque Isle. It submitted a 65-page ap-
plication. In that application, the Uni-
versity of Maine of Presque Isle used
11⁄2-line spacing instead of double spac-
ing in the text appearing in the graph-
ics on two of its application’s 65 pages.
I am not making this up. For that
reason alone, because the spacing was
11⁄2 lines rather than 2 on just 2 of the
graphs in a 65-page application, the De-
partment of Education rejected it—
based on that alone.
The Department’s bureaucratic deci-
sion would have denied 960 disadvan-
taged Maine high school students the
chance to fulfill their academic poten-
tial. Imagine that—that 960 students,
who needed the support of the TRIO
Program to be successful, would not
have been served because of a tiny for-
matting error on 2 pages of a 65-page
application. It was nothing sub-
stantive, just a formatting error.
After months of advocacy, I was able
to work with the Department of Edu-
cation and my Appropriations col-
leagues to reverse this ill-conceived de-
cision, and I am very happy to report
that the University of Maine of
Presque Isle is today serving those stu-
dents.
Our bill would prevent the Depart-
ment of Education from rejecting ap-
plications simply on the basis of the
formatting criteria that it suggests
and instead would establish a straight-
forward process of correction for appli-
cations with minor formatting or budg-
eting errors. This is a commonsense re-
form that will prevent unnecessary bu-
reaucratic obstacles in the future—ob-
stacles that have a real impact on the
lives of the students who are intended
to benefit from the TRIO Programs.
Fifth, our bill would make it simpler
for students who receive free and re-
duced-priced lunches and Pell grants to
qualify for the TRIO Programs. Prov-
ing income eligibility can be a barrier
to services, and this bill would make it
easier to identify potential partici-
pants for the TRIO Programs.
The bill would also update TRIO eli-
gibility criteria to reflect the most re-
cent requirements for Federal financial
aid. This would ensure that TRIO ad-
ministrators would not have to consult
multiple data sources and can instead
use a student’s most recent financial
aid information to determine eligi-
bility for the TRIO Programs rather
than having them go through an addi-
tional process.
Finally, the bill would require the
Department of Education to conduct
additional virtual training sessions,
better ensuring that all areas of the
country—especially our small, rural
communities—have the ability to know
about and access the TRIO Programs.
As the longtime cochair of the Con-
gressional TRIO Caucus, I have long
supported the TRIO Programs. I have
worked to ensure that they are reach-
ing the students who most need them.
So many students in Maine and across
the country have truly had their lives
changed by these wonderful programs,
such as Upward Bound. They have been
introduced to the world of higher edu-
cation. They have been given the sup-
port they need to succeed. In my State,
where so many families simply do not
have experience with higher education,
the TRIO Programs have made all the
difference for their sons and daughters.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3367
June 12, 2019
I urge my colleagues to support the
bipartisan Educational Opportunity
and Success Act.
By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr.
MERKLEY, Mr. KING, Mr.
SCHATZ, and Mr. REED):
S. 1821. A bill to amend the Energy
Independence and Security Act of 2007
to provide for research on, and the de-
velopment and deployment of, marine
energy, and for other purposes; to the
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources.
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, marine
energy technologies generate elec-
tricity using the natural power found
in ocean waves, tides, currents, and
temperature differences in ocean
water. This nontraditional form of hy-
dropower has the potential to fuel
American homes and businesses with
renewable electricity and address the
very real challenge of climate change.
Additionally, establishing a commer-
cially viable marine energy industry in
the United States would support a ro-
bust manufacturing and construction
supply chain and create thousands of
good-paying clean energy jobs.
The Department of Energy (DOE) es-
timates that marine energy could
produce enough renewable energy to
power millions of homes. Furthermore,
with more than half of the U.S. popu-
lation living within 50 miles of a body
of water, there is vast potential for ma-
rine energy to efficiently provide clean
electricity to communities across the
country—from large cities to remote
coastal communities.
Because these promising marine re-
newable energy technologies are still
in the early stages of development, fed-
eral support is needed to encourage pri-
vate investments in marine energy
projects, moving the United States
closer to large-scale deployment of
these innovative clean energy tech-
nologies.
The Marine Energy Research and De-
velopment Act advances this research
by reauthorizing DOE’s marine renew-
able energy programs from 2020
through 2021. The bill gives priority to
projects and technologies that have the
highest likelihood to lead to commer-
cial utilization of new marine energy
systems.
The bill also directs DOE to research
ways of building a stable marine en-
ergy supply chain in the United States,
as well as ways of harmonizing marine
energy development with ocean naviga-
tion, fisheries, and critical infrastruc-
ture such as undersea cables.
The bill includes funding authoriza-
tion for the National Marine Renew-
able Energy Research Centers, which
are located in Florida, Hawaii and the
Pacific Northwest. These three centers
make use of federal funding and the re-
sources of five universities to test and
refine various marine energy tech-
nologies. The bill also provides DOE
new authority to establish new Na-
tional Marine Energy Centers.
By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr.
REED, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, and Mr.

are pioneers of the LGBTQ movement for
equality;
Whereas, throughout much of the history
of the United States, same-sex relationships
were criminalized in many States and many
LGBTQ people in the United States were
forced to hide their LGBTQ identities while
living in secrecy and fear;
Whereas, on June 26, 2015, the Supreme
Court of the United States ruled in Obergefell
v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, that same-sex cou-

highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sac-
rifice, and family.’’;
Whereas Acquired Immunodeficiency Syn-
drome (referred to in this preamble as
‘‘AIDS’’) has disproportionately impacted
LGBTQ people in the United States, due in

Whereas LGBTQ people in the United

der identity in countries and territories such
as Chechnya, Egypt, Indonesia, and Tan-
zania;
Whereas people and countries around the

of attacks on LGBTQ communities in many
countries, including in Brunei, where a dra-
conian new set of laws was enacted in April
2019 that would impose the death penalty for
same-sex relations;
Whereas, in May 2019, Taiwan became the
first place in Asia to extend marriage rights
to same-sex couples;

Whereas LGBTQ people in the United

equal and just society;
Whereas, despite being marginalized
throughout the history of the United States,
LGBTQ people in the United States continue
to celebrate their identities, love, and con-
tributions to the United States in various
expressions of Pride; and
Whereas the inclusion of LGBTQ people in
the United States continues to expand every
day and LGBTQ people in the United States
remain determined to pursue equality, re-

(1) the term ‘‘covered recommendations’’
means the recommendations made by the
section 809 panel to—
(A) eliminate existing mandatory small
business set-aside requirements for readily
available products and services, with or
without customization; and
(B) prioritize the acquisition of commer-
cial products and services described in sub-
paragraph (A) and non-developmental items
using a price preference instead of using
small business set-aside programs;
(2) the term ‘‘section 809 panel’’ means the
advisory panel established under section 809
of the National Defense Authorization Act
for Fiscal Year 2016 (Public Law 114–92; 129

through the recommendations submitted by
the panel; and
(B) serves an important role in recom-
mending improvements to the defense acqui-
sition process;
(2) while well-intentioned, the covered rec-
ommendations are contrary to the policy set
forth in section 2(a) of the Small Business
Act (15 U.S.C. 631(a)), which states that the
security and economic well-being of the
United States ‘‘cannot be realized unless the
actual and potential capacity of small busi-
ness is encouraged and developed’’; and
(3) to the maximum extent possible, the
Federal Government should aid, assist, and
protect the interests of small business con-
cerns—
(A) in order to—
(i) preserve free enterprise;
(ii) foster increased competition, which re-
duces the costs incurred by the Department
of Defense; and

economy of the United States; and
(B) by ensuring that the Federal Govern-
ment—
(i) awards a fair proportion of the total
number of contracts and subcontracts for
property and services purchased by the Fed-
eral Government, including contracts and
subcontracts for maintenance, repair, and
construction, to small business concerns;

tection organization or law enforcement
training center with demonstrated expertise
in the delivery of law enforcement training—

prosecution, mental health, medical, and
victim advocacy to investigate sexual exploi-
tation, help children heal from sexual exploi-
tation, and hold offenders accountable.
(6) State and local authorities to address
law enforcement capacity in communities
where military installations are located, and
to prevent lapses in jurisdiction that would
undercut the Department’s efforts to prevent
child sexual exploitation.

SEC. lll. ESTABLISHMENT OF A HYBRID
THREAT CENTER ON INFLUENCE OP-
ERATIONS OF FOREIGN ADVER-
SARIES.
(a) DEFINITION OF INTELLIGENCE COMMU-
NITY.—In this section, the term ‘‘intelligence
community’’ has the meaning given such
term in section 3 of the National Security
Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3003).
(b) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Director of Na-
tional Intelligence shall establish a hybrid
threat center (in this section referred to as
the ‘‘Center’’) to assess and track, in a cross-
discipline and holistic manner, influence op-
erations of foreign adversaries carried out
against the United States.
(c) COMPOSITION.—The Director shall en-
sure that the Center is composed of individ-
uals from across the intelligence community
who are experts in the following:
(1) Cybersecurity.
(2) Military communications.
(3) Finance.
(4) Economics.
(5) Disinformation.
(6) Emerging technology.
(7) Leadership.
(8) Regional affairs.
(d) FUNCTIONS.—The functions of the Cen-
ter are as follows:
(1) To assess and track influence oper-
ations of foreign adversaries, including oper-
ations of adversaries carried out domesti-
cally and operations carried out abroad.
(2) To make information available to the
public regarding trends, threats, and tactics
deployed by foreign adversaries to under-
mine democratic institutions and influence
public opinion in the United States.
(3) To monitor disinformation operations
and influence campaigns of foreign adver-
saries.
(4) To give the intelligence community and
policymakers greater visibility into nebu-
lous, cross-border influence operations of
foreign adversaries.
(5) To monitor open source information,
particularly on social media, to analyze
disinformation campaigns and the
weaponization of information and ensure
that open source intelligence is given appro-
priate weight in analytic products of the in-
telligence community.
(6) To monitor technological trends, par-
ticularly important in cybersecurity and
disinformation operations of foreign adver-
saries, so policymakers can adapt the re-
sponses of the Federal Government accord-
ingly.
(7) To share information, as appropriate,
with allied intelligence partners on foreign
influence operations and tactics and in so
doing establish a two-way exchange of threat
information.
(e) ANNUAL REPORTS.—Not less frequently
than once each year, the Center shall submit
to Congress a report on the activities of the
Center and the implications of such activi-
ties to the privacy and civil liberties of the
people of the United States.
(f) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) the Center should supplant existing
task forces at individual agencies that have
mandates and resources which are limited by
their particular mission and budget;
(2) the intelligence community and Con-
gress should work together to resolve exist-
ing legal limitations on elements of the in-
telligence community to monitor
disinformation operations;
(3) the intelligence community and Con-
gress should ensure that appropriate legal
authorities are in place to protect the pri-
vacy and civil liberties of United States citi-
zens; and
(4) lessons learned from post-9/11 counter-
terrorism experiences should be applied to
foreign interference threats.

made available for inspection and
verification by the voter before the voter’s
vote is cast and counted, and which shall be
counted by hand or read by an optical char-

through the use of a nontabulating ballot
marking device or system, so long as the
voter shall have the option to mark his or
her ballot by hand.

voter with an opportunity to correct any
error on the paper ballot before the perma-
nent voter-verified paper ballot is preserved
in accordance with clause (ii).
‘‘(III) The voting system shall not preserve
the voter-verified paper ballots in any man-
ner that makes it possible, at any time after
the ballot has been cast, to associate a voter
with the record of the voter’s vote without
the voter’s consent.

The individual, durable, voter-verified paper
ballot used in accordance with clause (i)
shall constitute the official ballot and shall
be preserved and used as the official ballot
for purposes of any recount or audit con-
ducted with respect to any election for Fed-
eral office in which the voting system is
used.
‘‘(iii) MANUAL COUNTING REQUIREMENTS FOR
RECOUNTS AND AUDITS.—(I) Each paper ballot
used pursuant to clause (i) shall be suitable
for a manual audit, and shall be counted by
hand in any recount or audit conducted with
respect to any election for Federal office.
‘‘(II) In the event of any inconsistencies or
irregularities between any electronic vote
tallies and the vote tallies determined by
counting by hand the individual, durable,
voter-verified paper ballots used pursuant to
clause (i), and subject to subparagraph (B),
the individual, durable, voter-verified paper
ballots shall be the true and correct record
of the votes cast.

requirements of this subparagraph shall
apply to all ballots cast in elections for Fed-
eral office, including ballots cast by absent
uniformed services voters and overseas vot-

any electronic vote tallies and the vote tal-
lies determined by counting by hand the in-
dividual, durable, voter-verified paper bal-

with respect to any election for Federal of-
fice; and
‘‘(II) it is demonstrated by clear and con-
vincing evidence (as determined in accord-
ance with the applicable standards in the ju-
risdiction involved) in any recount, audit, or
contest of the result of the election that the
paper ballots have been compromised (by
damage or mischief or otherwise) and that a
sufficient number of the ballots have been so
compromised that the result of the election
could be changed,
the determination of the appropriate remedy
with respect to the election shall be made in
accordance with applicable State law, except
that the electronic tally shall not be used as
the exclusive basis for determining the offi-
cial certified result.
‘‘(ii) RULE FOR CONSIDERATION OF BALLOTS
ASSOCIATED WITH EACH VOTING MACHINE.—For
purposes of clause (i), only the paper ballots
deemed compromised, if any, shall be consid-
ered in the calculation of whether or not the
result of the election could be changed due
to the compromised paper ballots.’’.

At the end of subtitle B of title VII, add
the following:
SEC. 718. REQUIREMENT TO USE HUMAN-BASED
METHODS FOR CERTAIN MEDICAL
TRAINING.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) The Department of Defense has made
impressive strides in the development and
use of methods of medical training and troop
protection, such as the use of tourniquets
and improvements in body armor, that have
led to decreased battlefield fatalities.
(2) The Department of Defense uses more
than 8,500 live animals each year to train
physicians, medics, corpsmen, and other per-
sonnel methods of responding to severe bat-
tlefield injuries.
(3) The civilian sector has almost exclu-
sively phased in the use of superior human-
based training methods for numerous med-
ical procedures currently taught in military
courses using animals.
(4) Human-based medical training methods
such as simulators replicate human anatomy
and can allow for repetitive practice and
data collection.
(5) According to scientific, peer-reviewed
literature, medical simulation increases pa-
tient safety and decreases errors by
healthcare providers.
(6) The Army Research, Development and
Engineering Command and other entities of
the Department of Defense have taken sig-
nificant steps to develop methods to replace
live animal-based training.
(7) According to the report by the Depart-
ment of Defense titled ‘‘Final Report on the
use of Live Animals in Medical Education
and Training Joint Analysis Team’’, pub-
lished on July 12, 2009—
(A) validated, high-fidelity simulators
were to have been available for nearly every
high-volume or high-value battlefield med-
ical procedure by the end of 2011, and many
were available as of 2009; and
(B) validated, high-fidelity simulators were
to have been available to teach all other pro-
cedures to respond to common battlefield in-
juries by 2014.
(8) The Center for Sustainment of Trauma
and Readiness Skills of the Air Force exclu-
sively uses human-based training methods in
its courses and does not use animals.
(9) In 2013, the Army instituted a policy
forbidding non-medical personnel from par-
ticipating in training courses involving the
use of animals.
(10) In 2013, the medical school of the De-
partment of Defense, part of the Uniformed
Services University of the Health Sciences,
replaced animal use within its medical stu-
dent curriculum.
(11) The Coast Guard announced in 2014
that it would reduce by half the number of
animals it uses for combat trauma training
courses but stated that animals would con-
tinue to be used in courses designed for De-
partment of Defense personnel.
(12) Effective January 1, 2015, the Depart-
ment of Defense replaced animal use in six
areas of medical training, including Ad-
vanced Trauma Life Support courses and the
development and maintenance of surgical
and critical care skills for field operational
surgery and field assessment and skills tests
for international students offered at the De-
fense Institute of Medical Operations.

SEC. 333. SENSE OF SENATE ON PRIORITIZING
SURVIVABLE LOGISTICS FOR THE
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.
It is the sense of the Senate that—
(1) resilient and agile logistics are nec-
essary to implement the 2018 National De-
fense Strategy because it enables the United
States to project power and sustain the fight
against its strategic competitors in peace-
time and during war;
(2) the joint logistics enterprise of the
Armed Forces of the United States faces
high-end threats from strategic competitors
China, Russia, and Iran, all of whom have in-
vested in anti-access area denial capabilities
and gray zone tactics;
(3) there are significant logistics short-
falls, as outlined in the November 2018 final
report of the Defense Science Board (DSB)
Task Force on Survivable Logistics, which,
if left unaddressed, would hamper the readi-
ness and ability of the Armed Forces of the
United States to conduct operations glob-
ally;
(4) the military departments have not
shown a strong commitment to funding lo-
gistics, for example—
(A) the Army and the Air Force, excluding
the reserve components, requested $76,000,000
and $25,000,000 less, respectively, for logistics
between fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020;
(B) since fiscal year 2018, there has been
neither a line item request for the National
Defense Sealift Fund nor a request to in-
crease more prepositioning or surge ships;
and
(C) the Marine Corps only asked for
$5,000,000 more in procurement of commer-
cial cargo vehicles for fiscal year 2020; and
(5) the Secretary of Defense should enact
the full list of recommendations listed in the
November 2018 final report of the Defense
Science Board (DSB) Task Force on Surviv-
able Logistics and, particularly, the Sec-
retary should address the chronic under-
funding of logistics relative to other prior-
ities of the Department of Defense.

SEC. lll. STUDY ON COLLABORATION BE-
TWEEN DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
AND DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY ON
ENERGY RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT,
AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) The Department of Defense will invest
$1,600,000,000 this year in research, develop-
ment, testing, and evaluation (RDT&E) that
is directly related to energy.
(2) Such investment in energy reflects the
Armed Forces’ characteristic pursuit of ad-
vanced technology as a force multiplier.
(3) The Department played a major role in
the development of at least three of the most
important energy innovations of the last 75
years, namely the nuclear reactor, the gas
turbine or jet engine, and the solar photo-
voltaic (PV) cell.
(4) The Department has been the driver for
many major non-energy innovations as well,
including radar, satellites, the Global Posi-
tioning System (GPS), lasers, computers and
semiconductors, robotics, artificial intel-
ligence, and the Internet.
(5) The energy needs of the Department are
changing and growing. Most significant, the
dramatic increase in electrical systems on-
board military platforms is driving elec-
trification of the battlefield. That and the
need to reduce the logistics footprint are cre-
ating requirements for distributed and port-
able power generation, smart energy net-
works, improved energy storage, and wire-
less power transmission.
(6) The approach of the Department to in-
novation is well suited to energy innovation,
including vendors’ need to both demonstrate
their complex technologies at scale, under
realistic conditions (Department bases and
platforms, combined with the Armed Forces’
test-and-evaluation culture are a unique re-
source), and compete on price with low-cost
incumbents (the Department values perform-
ance over price, and the military market is
large enough to yield economies of scale and
learning by doing).
(b) STUDY AND REPORT REQUIRED.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days
after the date of the enactment of this Act,
the Secretary of Defense shall—
(A) complete a study on identifying im-
pediments to, and opportunities for, greater
collaboration between the Department of De-
fense and the Department of Energy on en-
ergy research, development, and potential
technology transfer, particularly in the
areas of solar photovoltaic, micorgrids, en-
ergy storage, and wide bandgap semiconduc-
tors; and
(B) submit to Congress the findings of the
Secretary with respect to the study com-
pleted under subparagraph (A).
(2) IDENTIFICATION OF AUTHORITY GAPS.—In
carrying out the study required by para-
graph (1)(A), the Secretary shall identify
current areas where the executive branch
does not have adequate authority to foster
the collaboration described in such para-
graph.

SEC. 16ll. SENSE OF SENATE ON SUPPORT FOR
A ROBUST AND MODERN ICBM
FORCE TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF
THE NUCLEAR TRIAD OF THE
UNITED STATES.
(a) FINDINGS.—The Senate makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) Land-based intercontinental ballistic
missiles (in this section referred to as
‘‘ICBMs’’) have been a critical part of the
strategic deterrent of the United States for 6
decades in conjunction with air and sea-
based strategic delivery systems.
(2) President John F. Kennedy referred to
the deployment of the first Minuteman mis-
sile during the Cuban Missile Crisis as his
‘‘ace in the hole’’.
(3) The Minuteman III missile entered
service in 1970 and is still deployed in 2019,
well beyond its originally intended service
life.
(4) The ICBM force of the United States
peaked at more than 1,200 deployed missiles
during the Cold War.
(5) The ICBM force of the United States
currently consists of approximately 400 Min-
uteman III missiles deployed across 450 oper-
ational missile silos, each carrying a single
warhead.
(6) The Russian Federation currently de-
ploys at least 300 ICBMs with multiple war-
heads loaded on each missile and has an-
nounced plans to replace its Soviet-era sys-
tems with modernized ICBMs.
(7) The People’s Republic of China cur-
rently deploys at least 75 ICBMs and plans to
grow its ICBM force through the deployment
of modernized, road-mobile ICBMs that carry
multiple warheads.
(8) The Russian Federation and the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China deploy nuclear weap-
ons across a variety of platforms in addition
to their ICBM forces.
(9) Numerous countries possess or are seek-
ing to develop nuclear weapons capabilities
that pose challenges to the nuclear deter-
rence of the United States.
(10) The nuclear deterrent of the United
States is comprised of a triad of delivery sys-
tems for nuclear weapons, including sub-
marine-launched ballistic missiles (in this
subsection referred to as ‘‘SLBMs’’), air-de-
livered gravity bombs and cruise missiles,
and land-based ballistic missiles that provide
interlocking and mutually reinforcing at-
tributes that enhance strategic deterrence.
(11) Weakening one leg of the triad limits
the deterrent value of the other legs of the
triad.
(12) In the nuclear deterrent of the United
States, ICBMs provide commanders with the
most prompt response capability, SLBMs
provide stealth and survivability, and air-
craft armed with nuclear weapons provide
flexibility.
(13) The ICBM force of the United States
forces any would-be attacker to confront
more than 400 discrete targets, thus creating
an effectively insurmountable targeting
problem for a potential adversary.
(14) The size, dispersal, and global reach of
the ICBM force of the United States ensures
that no adversary can escalate a crisis be-
yond the ability of the United States to re-
spond.
(15) A potential attacker would be forced
to expend far more warheads to destroy the
ICBMs of the United States than the United
States would lose in an attack, because of
the deployment of a single warhead on each
ICBM of the United States.
(16) The ICBM force provides a persistent
deterrent capability that reinforces strategic
stability.
(17) ICBMs are the cheapest delivery sys-
tem for nuclear weapons for the United
States to operate and maintain.
(18) United States Strategic Command has
validated military requirements for the
unique capabilities of ICBMs.
(19) In a 2014 analysis of alternatives, the
Air Force concluded that replacing the Min-
uteman III missile would provide upgraded
capabilities at lower cost when compared
with extending the service life of the Min-
uteman III missile.
(20) The Minuteman III replacement pro-
gram, known as the ground-based strategic
deterrent, is expected to provide a land-
based strategic deterrent capability for 5
decades after the program enters service.
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense
of the Senate that—
(1) land-based ICBMs have certain charac-
teristics, including responsiveness, persist-
ence, and dispersal, that enhance strategic
stability and magnify the deterrent value of

triad of the United States;

Subtitle llProtecting Unaccompanied Alien
Children
SEC. ll1. SHORT TITLE.
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Fami-
lies, Not Facilities Act of 2019’’.
SEC. ll2. FINDINGS.
Congress makes the following findings:
(1) On May 13, 2018, a Memorandum of
Agreement between U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement, U.S. Customs and
Border Patrol of the Department of Home-
land Security, and the Office of Refugee Re-
settlement of the Department of Health and
Human Services went into effect to allow for
intergovernmental sharing of personal infor-
mation about unaccompanied alien children,
their prospective sponsors, and adult mem-
bers of sponsor households.
(2) U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforce-
ment is using information obtained under
the Memorandum of Agreement to conduct
civil immigration enforcement actions
against individuals residing in the homes of
prospective sponsors of unaccompanied alien
children.
(3) These civil immigration enforcement
actions have discouraged prospective spon-
sors of unaccompanied alien children, includ-
ing family members, from coming forward to
resettle children in the community as they
pursue lawful claims for humanitarian pro-
tection.
(4) As a result of the lack of qualified spon-
sors, unprecedented numbers of unaccom-
panied alien children (approximately 14,600
in December 2018) are being held in shelters
overseen by the Office of Refugee Resettle-
ment as of the date of enactment of this Act.
(5) The Office of Refugee Resettlement is
struggling to accommodate the growing
number of unaccompanied alien children in
its shelter network, resorting to placing
children in temporary ‘‘emergency influx’’
shelters. The Office contracted with BCFS to
care for more than 6,200 children between
June 2018 and January 2019 in a temporary
shelter at the Tornillo-Guadalupe Land Port
of Entry in Texas, a facility that the New
York Times and other media sources de-
scribed as a ‘‘tent city’’, and announced
plans in January 2019 to nearly double the
number of children held in a previously
closed temporary shelter in Homestead,
Florida.
(6) Temporary shelters are inappropriate
locations to hold unaccompanied alien chil-
dren because such shelters—
(A) have reduced standards of care, includ-
ing insufficient educational services;
(B) offer limited access to clinical and
legal services; and
(C) are not cost-effective, resulting in the
expenditure of more than $750 per day in tax-
payer funds for each child housed in Tornillo
shelter, for example.
(7) Facilities operated under a contract
with the Office of Refugee Resettlement
have faced unacceptable allegations of abuse
and neglect of unaccompanied alien children
that merit additional investigation and over-
sight.
(8) The Office of Refugee Resettlement is
legally required to place children in the least
restrictive setting that is in the best interest
of the child.
(9) Services offered at facilities funded by
the Office of Refugee Resettlement are re-
quired to include classroom education, men-
tal and medical health services, case man-
agement, socialization and recreation activi-
ties, and family reunification services that
facilitate the safe and timely release of un-
accompanied alien children to family mem-
bers or other sponsors that can care for
them.
(10) Providing legal and case management
services to all children while they are housed
in a facility funded by the Office of Refugee
Resettlement and after their release from
such a facility is a cost-effective and humane
way of ensuring that the Office of Refugee
Resettlement meets its statutory obligation
to place children in least restrictive set-
tings.

company Rosneft, using 49.9 percent of
PDVSA’s American subsidiary, CITGO Pe-
troleum Corporation, including its assets in
the United States, as collateral. As a result
of this transaction, 100 percent of CITGO is
held as collateral by PDVSA’s creditors.
(2) CITGO, a wholly owned subsidiary of
PDVSA, is engaged in interstate commerce
and owns and controls critical energy infra-
structure in 19 States of the United States,
including an extensive network of pipelines,
48 terminals, and 3 refineries, with a com-
bined oil refining capacity of 749,000 barrels
per day. CITGO’s refinery in Lake Charles,
Louisiana, is the sixth largest refinery in the
United States.
(3) The Department of the Treasury im-
posed sanctions on Rosneft, which is con-
trolled by the Government of the Russian
Federation, and its Executive Chairman,
Igor Sechin, following Russia’s military in-
vasion of Ukraine and its illegal annexation
of Crimea in 2014.
(4) The Department of Homeland Security
has designated the energy sector as critical
to United States infrastructure.
(5) The growing economic crisis in Ven-
ezuela raises the probability that the
Maduro regime and PDVSA will default on
their international debt obligations, result-
ing in a scenario in which Rosneft could
come into control of CITGO’s United States
energy infrastructure holdings.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) control of critical United States energy
infrastructure by Rosneft, a Russian govern-
ment-controlled entity currently under
United States sanctions that is led by Igor
Sechin, who is also under United States
sanctions and is a close associate of Vladimir
Putin, would pose a significant risk to
United States national security and energy
security; and
(2) a default by PDVSA on its loan from
Rosneft, resulting in Rosneft coming into
possession of PDVSA’s United States CITGO
assets, would warrant careful consideration
by the Committee on Foreign Investment in
the United States.
(c) PREVENTING ROSNEFT FROM CONTROL-
LING UNITED STATES ENERGY INFRASTRUC-
TURE.—The President shall take all nec-
essary steps to prevent Rosneft from gaining
control of critical United States energy in-
frastructure.
(d) SECURITY RISK BRIEFING.—Not later

of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Secu-

infrastructure holdings to—

and Governmental Affairs of the Senate;
(3) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the

of the House of Representatives.

IZATION.
(a) IN GENERAL.—In accordance with this
section, the appropriate discharge boards—
(1) shall review the discharge characteriza-
tion of covered members at the request of
the covered member; and
(2) if such characterization is any charac-
terization except honorable, may change
such characterization to honorable.
(b) CRITERIA.—In changing the discharge
characterization of a covered member to
honorable under subsection (a)(2), the Sec-
retary of Defense shall ensure that such
changes are carried out consistently and uni-
formly across the military departments
using the following criteria:
(1) The original discharge must be based on
Don’t Ask Don’t Tell (in this Act referred to
as ‘‘DADT’’) or a similar policy in place prior
to the enactment of DADT.
(2) Such discharge characterization shall
be so changed if, with respect to the original
discharge, there were no aggravating cir-
cumstances, such as misconduct, that would
have independently led to a discharge char-
acterization that was any characterization
except honorable. For purposes of this para-
graph, such aggravating circumstances may
not include—
(A) an offense under section 925 of title 10,
United States Code (article 125 of the Uni-
form Code of Military Justice), committed
by a covered member against a person of the
same sex with the consent of such person; or
(B) statements, consensual sexual conduct,
or consensual acts relating to sexual orienta-
tion or identity, or the disclosure of such
statements, conduct, or acts, that were pro-
hibited at the time of discharge but after the
date of such discharge became permitted.
(3) When requesting a review, a covered
member, or the member’s representative,
shall be required to provide either—
(A) documents consisting of—
(i) a copy of the DD–214 form of the mem-
ber;
(ii) a personal affidavit of the cir-
cumstances surrounding the discharge; and
(iii) any relevant records pertaining to the
discharge; or
(B) an affidavit certifying that the mem-
ber, or the member’s representative, does not
have the documents specified in subpara-
graph (A).
(4) If a covered member provides an affi-
davit described in subparagraph (B) of para-
graph (3)—
(A) the appropriate discharge board shall
make every effort to locate the documents
specified in subparagraph (A) of such para-
graph within the records of the Department
of Defense; and
(B) the absence of such documents may not
be considered a reason to deny a change of
the discharge characterization under sub-
section (a)(2).
(c) REQUEST FOR REVIEW.—The appropriate
discharge board shall ensure the mechanism
by which covered members, or their rep-
resentative, may request to have the dis-
charge characterization of the covered mem-
ber reviewed under this section is simple and
straightforward.
(d) REVIEW.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—After a request has been
made under subsection (c), the appropriate
discharge board shall review all relevant
laws, records of oral testimony previously
taken, service records, or any other relevant
information regarding the discharge charac-
terization of the covered member.
(2) ADDITIONAL MATERIALS.—If additional
materials are necessary for the review, the
appropriate discharge board—
(A) may request additional information
from the covered member or the member’s
representative, in writing, and specifically
detailing what is being requested; and
(B) shall be responsible for obtaining a
copy of the necessary files of the covered
member from the member, or when applica-
ble, from the Department of Defense.
(e) CHANGE OF CHARACTERIZATION.—The ap-
propriate discharge board shall change the
discharge characterization of a covered
member to honorable if such change is deter-
mined to be appropriate after a review is
conducted under subsection (d) pursuant to
the criteria under subsection (b). A covered
member, or the member’s representative,
may appeal a decision by the appropriate dis-
charge board to not change the discharge
characterization by using the regular ap-
peals process of the board.
(f) CHANGE OF RECORDS.—For each covered
member whose discharge characterization is
changed under subsection (e), or for each
covered member who was honorably dis-
charged but whose DD–214 form reflects the
sexual orientation of the member, the Sec-
retary of Defense shall reissue to the mem-
ber or the member’s representative a revised
DD–214 form that reflects the following:
(1) For each covered member discharged,
the Separation Code, Reentry Code, Nar-
rative Code, and Separation Authority shall
not reflect the sexual orientation of the
member and shall be placed under secretarial
authority. Any other similar indication of
the sexual orientation or reason for dis-
charge shall be removed or changed accord-
ingly to be consistent with this paragraph.
(2) For each covered member whose dis-
charge occurred prior to the creation of gen-
eral secretarial authority, the sections of the
DD–214 form referred to paragraph (1) shall
be changed to similarly reflect a universal
authority with codes, authorities, and lan-
guage applicable at the time of discharge.
(g) STATUS.—

whose discharge characterization is changed
under subsection (e) shall be treated without
regard to the original discharge character-
ization of the member, including for pur-
poses of—

ernment to an individual by reason of service
in the Armed Forces; and

acterization of the member.

TERIZATION FOR VETERANS BENEFITS.—For
purposes of the provision of benefits to which
veterans are entitled under the laws admin-
istered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs
to a covered member whose discharge char-

the date of discharge of the member from the
Armed Forces shall be deemed to be the ef-
fective date of the change of discharge char-
acterization under that subsection.
(4) CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this sub-
section shall be construed to authorize any
benefit to a covered member in connection
with the change of discharge characteriza-
tion of the member under subsection (e) for
any period before the effective date of the
change of discharge characterization.

(1) The term ‘‘appropriate discharge board’’

Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,
should—
(1) ensure the dignified, safe, sustainable,
and voluntary return of all those displaced
from their homes, especially from Rakhine

proof, and the opportunity to obtain appro-
priate compensation to restart their lives in
Burma;

or restored full citizenship and all the rights
that adhere to citizenship in Burma;
(3) offer to those who do not want to return
meaningful opportunity to obtain appro-
priate compensation or restitution;

nally displaced persons camps or ‘‘model vil-
lages’’, but instead make efforts to recon-
struct Rohingya villages as and where they
were;
(5) facilitate the return of any funds col-
lected by the Government by harvesting the
land previously owned and tended by
Rohingya farmers for them upon their re-
turn;
(6) fully implement all of the recommenda-
tions of the Advisory Commission on
Rakhine State; and

gladesh and in internally displaced persons
camps in Burma, have freedom of movement,
including outside of the camps, and under no
circumstance are subject to unsafe, involun-
tary, or uninformed repatriation;
(2) to ensure the dignified, safe, sustain-
able, and voluntary return of those displaced
from their homes, and offer to those who do
not want to return meaningful means to ob-
tain compensation or restitution; and

ecute violence against women, sexual vio-
lence, or other gender-based violence.

SGT. FIRST CLASS WILL D.
LINDSAY TRIBUTE
HON. SCOTT R. TIPTON
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Sgt. First Class Will D. Lindsay from
Cortez, Colorado, an American soldier who
was recently killed defending our country in
the Kunduz Province of Afghanistan. He and
Spc. Joseph Collette, both Fort Carson based
soldiers, were killed in an attack fighting
against the Taliban.
Sgt. Lindsay was born in Cortez in 1985.
The grandson of World War II veteran Richard
Lindsay and World War II veteran Warren
Waldorf, he was no stranger to service. He fol-
lowed his grandfather’s footsteps when he en-
listed into the Army in 2004, ultimately getting
selected into the elite 10th Special Forces
Group. This prestigious fighting group deploys
to some of the world’s most heated combat
zones and Sgt. Lindsay bravely deployed with
them seven times including five tours in Iraq,
one in Tajikistan and this final deployment to
Afghanistan.
As a highly decorated combat veteran, Sgt.
Lindsay had an expansive list of military
awards and decorations to include a Silver
Star, Purple Heart, four Bronze Stars, two
Meritorious Service Medals, two Meritorious
Unit Awards, the Valorous Unit Award, the
Army Superior Unit Award, four Army Good
Conduct Medals, the National Defense Service
Medal, the Global War on Terror Service
Medal, the NCO Professional Development
Ribbon with numeral four, the Army Service
Ribbon, two Overseas Service Ribbons, the
NATO Medal, the Special Forces Tab, the
Combat Infantry Badge, the Military Free Fall
Jumpmaster Badge, the Master Parachutist
Badge, the Chilean Airborne Wings, and the
Senior Instructor Badge. Sgt. Lindsay’s record
is a testament to his commitment of putting
country before self, as he did in the Army for
nearly 15 years.
I stand before the House of Representatives
with a heavy heart thinking about his family
and their great loss, especially his wife Sarah,
his four daughters and his parents Grant and
Tammy. I join the town of Cortez, his brothers
and sisters in arms, and the entire nation in
mourning his untimely death. I have gotten to
know Sgt. Lindsay’s family over the years and
his loss will be felt by many in our small com-
munity.
Madam Speaker, Sgt. Lindsay’s death is a
painful reminder of the sacrifices our men and
women in the military endure as well as their
families. Sgt. Lindsay was a true American
hero from one of the most rural areas in Colo-
rado who died protecting his men and the
country he loved. He dedicated his life to self-
lessly protect our great nation and we are all
proud of him. His loss is tragic, but his legacy
will be remembered for generations to come,
and the world is a better place because of
him.
JOHN KELLY
HON. JACKIE SPEIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, on May 20,
2019 the world lost an icon, a Samaritan, a
teacher, a mentor, a friend who made San
Mateo County a better place. John Kelly
passed away at age 90 after dedicating his
entire life to others. He was a social justice
giant who believed in everybody and never
gave up on anybody, even the most
marginalized in society. He was a priest, a
teacher at Serra High School, a mentor to in-
mates at San Quentin Prison, and the first Ex-
ecutive Director of Samaritan House in San
Mateo. Samaritan House epitomizes what
John believed: everyone has the right to live
in dignity and we have a common responsi-
bility to help those in need. Samaritan House
was founded in 1974 and provides services to
people living in poverty, including shelter and
housing assistance, medical and dental clinics,
clothes for children, and personalized case
management. Most importantly, while pro-
viding the emergency services, it guides peo-
ple to self-reliance.
During his tenure from 1985 to 1999, John
Kelly nurtured Samaritan House from a fledg-
ling operation to a full-service non-profit orga-
nization. Whatever John touched thrived and
made a difference in people’s lives. He made
a difference in my life. Like so many in our
community, I deeply admired his generosity,
integrity, moral compass and wonderful sense
of humor. The spirit of John Kelly will forever
live on in San Mateo County.

HONORING COACH LAMPKIN FOR
HER 40-YEAR CAREER AT HER-
MANN HIGH SCHOOL
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to congratulate Coach Linda
Lampkin on her retirement after a remarkable
40-year career at Hermann High School.
Coach Lampkin is a Missouri high school
sports icon. Growing up in Berger, she spent
her childhood in the same school district she
would later dedicate four decades of her adult
life to—Gasconade County R–I schools in
Hermann, MO. At Hermann High she excelled
in softball and volleyball before going on to
play volleyball at Southwest Missouri State
University in Springfield, Missouri.
In 1979 Coach Lampkin returned to Her-
mann to begin her teaching and coaching ca-
reer. Throughout her years at Hermann High,
she filled a variety of positions including: phys-
ical education, health, and weightlifting teach-
er; athletic director, assistant principal, and
coaching both volleyball and softball. Starting
as the assistant volleyball coach, she became
head coach in 1980 and held the position for
an astonishing 39 years.
Throughout her Hall of Fame career, Coach
Lampkin’s teams accomplished unbelievable
success. Her teams won 22 Four Rivers Con-
ference championships, 32 district champion-
ships, qualified for the final four 24 times, and
won 13 state championships. 49 young
women who played for Coach Lampkin have
received All State honors. It’s safe to say if
you played volleyball at Hermann High over
the last 40 years, you experienced a great
deal of success.
Twelve times over the course of her career
Coach Lampkin was named Coach of the
Year by the Missouri Coaches Association. In
2011, she was named to the Missouri High
School Volleyball Coaches Association Hall of
Fame. Two years later she was inducted into
the Missouri Sports Hall of fame.
Even with all that success and countless ac-
colades I believe Coach Lampkin would say
her greatest accomplishment was the positive
impact she had on so many lives. She helped
shepherd countless young women into adult-
hood who, in many cases, got to watch their
own daughters play for arguably the best
volleyball coach in Missouri’s history. As a
parent and grandparent there are few greater
comforts than knowing when your children
leave for school they’re being taught and
cared for by people of the highest integrity.
Thanks to Coach Linda Lampkin, parents in
Gasconade County have been given that com-
fort for 40 years.
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating Coach Linda Lampkin on an ex-
traordinary career and wish her all the best in
her much-deserved retirement.

HONORING DOUG WILSON FOR RE-
TIRING AS MAYOR OF HENRY, IL
HON. DARIN LaHOOD
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I would like
to honor Doug Wilson for his retirement as the
mayor of Henry, Illinois.
Mayor Wilson will retire after eight years of
service in local government. Wilson began
serving as a member of the City Council in
2011 before becoming mayor in 2014. One of
the most important causes that Mayor Wilson
championed was the Port of Henry. Wilson
worked tirelessly to lure in a new industry with
the ability to spark considerable economic
growth to the area. After nearly a decade of
dedication to the people of Henry, Mayor Wil-
son’s public service has left a profound impact
on our community.
I am grateful for Mayor Wilson’s time and
commitment to the city of Henry. His work as
a public servant has left a legacy in our com-
munity that will remain for generations to
come.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE TRADI-
TION OF BREAKFAST ON THE
FARM IN WAUPACA COUNTY
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the tradition of Breakfast
on the Farm in Waupaca County located this
year in Weyauwega.
Breakfast on the Farm is an iconic Wis-
consin tradition that provides the community
an opportunity to learn about the significant
role the dairy industry plays in Wisconsin’s
economy. Community members meet dairy
farmers, explore farm equipment, and enjoy a
hearty meal together.
I am grateful for the Weyauwega-Fremont
Future Farmers of America for organizing
Waupaca County’s Breakfast on the Farm.
Their work to recruit sponsors and volunteers
is integral to the success of this terrific event.
In addition to breakfast, the event includes a
petting zoo, hayrides, children’s activities and
viewings of farm equipment. All proceeds from
the Waupaca County Breakfast on the Farm
are used for FFA leadership conferences, con-
ventions, and scholarships.
The National FFA Organization is a youth
organization that prepares students for leader-
ship and career success in the field of agri-
culture. Since 1928, the National FFA Organi-
zation has been fostering student engagement
in agricultural education through hands-on ex-
periential learning opportunities, national
events and conferences, and scholarship and
grant programs. The organization has seen
much success over the years, and currently
supports 669,989 members in 8,630 chapters
throughout the country.
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this
body to join me in commending the efforts of
Breakfast on the Farm to educate the commu-
nity through this time-honored tradition. Thank
you to the Weyauwega-Fremont Future Farm-
ers of America and the countless sponsors
and volunteers for their continued support of
Wisconsin’s dairy industry.

IN HONOR OF THE DEDICATION OF
THE SERGEANT DONALD
BURGETT POST OFFICE BUILD-
ING IN HOWELL, MICHIGAN
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, today I rise
to honor Sergeant Donald Burgett, an Amer-
ican hero to whom the people of the 8th Dis-
trict of Michigan, along with the entire nation,
are deeply indebted. As Congress has
deemed, the United States Post Office in
Howell, Michigan, shall henceforth be known
as the Sergeant Donald Burgett Post Office
Building, enshrining the legacy of this valiant
champion of freedom for generations to come.
Sergeant Burgett was born in Detroit in
1925 and served as a rifleman and machine-
gunner in the 101st Airborne Division’s 506th
Parachute Infantry Regiment. His service took
him throughout the European theater and in-
cluded parachuting into Normandy in the
opening hours of D-Day.
His devotion to country did not end with his
service, however, as he returned to Howell
after the war and committed himself to
bettering the community through veterans’ or-
ganizations and civic leadership, and by
chronicling the war’s events in several highly
acclaimed books.
Sgt. Burgett was deeply committed to re-
cording the experiences of his colleagues-in-
arms so that their legacy would live on. Now,
we have the distinct honor of doing likewise,
by dedicating a public building in his name.
I can think of no more fitting tribute on this
Flag Day, which comes just days after the
commemoration of the 75th anniversary of D-
Day, than to honor the heroism of a man who
lived and died under the flag and whose very
name is synonymous with its ideals.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in paying tribute to Sgt. Burgett and his
extraordinary life and legacy of service. May
all who enter the building that now bears his
name be inspired to the principles of service
over self and love of country by which he
lived.

TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF DEBORAH
L. FENG
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor a woman who has made extraor-
dinary contributions to our nation, devoting
more than 32 years of her professional life to
management of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) at Ames Re-
search Center, Moffett Field, California.
Deborah Feng’s responsibilities at NASA in-
cluded working with and understanding the op-
erations of city government; financial manage-
ment and budgeting; master planning and fa-
cilities construction; information technology;
human resources; partnerships, safety and
mission assurance; and communications and
outreach. More recently, she has become
widely known for her leadership in large leas-
ing transactions for NASA Ames, notably the
Moffett Federal Airfield Lease (2014). The cul-
mination of her NASA career was serving as
Associate Center Director.
In December 2018, Deborah Feng com-
pleted negotiations to build housing, including
affordable apartments, on NASA property.
This is the first such project in the nation for
NASA employees and those who attend
school on the property.

for over 30 years, providing a great service to
the people of North Carolina.
I am honored and humbled to represent a
woman who served her state with such dedi-
cation, courage, and selflessness. Tiawana
Ramsey began her career with North Carolina
Emergency Management in November of 1988
as Secretary. She performed her job with
great attention to detail and was promoted to
Program Assistant in January 1994. After well-
deserved promotions to Administrative Assist-
ant and then Emergency Management Planner
Specializing in Earthquakes, Mrs. Ramsey
was honored with the job title of Area 12 Co-
ordinator in July 2007. In this role, Tiawana
oversaw a three-tiered response system which
serviced disaster events in both familiar and
unfamiliar areas in the counties of Ashe,
Avery, Caldwell, McDowell, Mitchell, Watauga,
and Yancey.
In her positions of responsibility, Tiawana
demonstrated poise, foresight, and account-
ability in constructing disaster preparation and
disaster response plans. Her efforts have un-
doubtedly saved numerous lives and pre-
vented many deaths from natural disasters in
the areas she has served.
Mrs. Tiawana Ramsey is the proud wife of
Mr. Jimmie Ramsey, who also serves in the
North Carolina Division of Emergency Man-
agement. Mrs. Ramsey has had a tremendous
impact on her community, and she will always
be remembered for her diligent, professional
service to the state of North Carolina. I thank
Tiawana for her three decades of service and
wish her the best in her retirement.

CONGRATULATING THE TUCSON
BOTANICAL GARDEN DISPLAY IN
OUR CAPITAL
HON. RAÚL M. GRIJALVA
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate the Tucson Botanical
Gardens for their achievement in bringing a
piece of Tucson’s rich cultural heritage to the
National Mall in Washington, D.C. and recre-
ating their Barrio Garden in the U.S. Botanical
Gardens. For 55 years, the Tucson Botanical
Garden has demonstrated an unwavering
commitment to connecting people with plants
and nature through art, science, history, and
culture, and I’m proud their work will be
shared in the heart of our nation’s capital.
As the oldest botanical gardens in North
America, the U.S. Botanical Garden’s displays
include plants and visual elements to provide
visitors with a deeper understanding of the va-
riety of flora and garden cultures found across
the country—including their styles, regional
characteristics, and missions.
The theme of this year’s exhibit is Gardens
Grow Diversity, and I can think of no better
representative of this than the Tucson Botan-
ical Gardens. As one of only 14 public gar-
dens to be selected, the Tucson Botanical
Garden will share Tucson’s own Barrio culture
and the rich local heritage it represents with
the millions of guests who visit Washington,
D.C. every summer.
Founded in 1964, the Tucson Botanical Gar-
den has been committed to creating a garden
that was aesthetically appealing and edu-
cational. Containing an extensive collection of
over 5,400 plants, this garden serves to show-
case the local community and the diversity it
reflects. The Tucson Botanical Garden has re-
ceived numerous honors and was named one
of the top ten gardens to visit in North Amer-
ica by Readers Digest and the Canadian Gar-
den Council.
I am especially grateful for their dedication
to creating a community resource for Tucson’s
learners of all ages, knowledge levels, and
abilities. In hosting events such as farm to fork
feasts, dog days, and exhibits showcasing
local and national art, the garden has lived up
to their mission, and is an invaluable resource
to the Tucson community.
I congratulate the Tucson Botanical Gar-
dens on being selected for this honor, and am
excited to see a piece of Southern Arizona’s
Sonoran Desert culture in Washington, D.C.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE TRADI-
TION OF BREAKFAST ON THE
FARM IN KEWAUNEE COUNTY
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the tradition of Breakfast
on the Farm in Kewaunee County hosted this
year by Kinnard Farms in Casco.
Breakfast on the Farm is an iconic Wis-
consin tradition that provides the community
an opportunity to see first-hand how a dairy
farm operates and learn about the significant
role the dairy industry plays in Wisconsin’s
economy. Community members meet dairy
farmers, explore the barns and equipment,
and enjoy a delicious meal prepared on the
farm.
I am grateful to Kinnard Farms for hosting
the 2019 Kewaunee County Breakfast on the
Farm. Kinnard Farms was founded on April 9,
1948 by Alvin and Milly Kinnard with the pur-
chase of eighty acres, fourteen cows, and
seven heifers. Today, the Kinnard Family
farms over 10,000 acres and milks 7,200 cows
between two locations. Ninety percent of to-
day’s herd originates from the bloodline of the
original fourteen cows purchased by Alvin and
Milly.
Kewaunee County Dairy Promotion orga-
nizes the annual Breakfast on the Farm by re-
cruiting host farms, sponsors and volunteers
to support this terrific event. In addition,
Kewaunee County Dairy Promotion provides
educational opportunities to the community to
increase awareness of Wisconsin’s daily in-
dustry and the products produced by area
daily farmers.
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members of this
body to join me in commending the efforts of
Breakfast on the Farm to educate the commu-
nity through this time-honored tradition. Thank
you to the Kinnards, Kewaunee County Dairy
Promotion, and the countless sponsors and
volunteers for their continued support of Wis-
consin’s dairy industry.

IMPORTANCE OF FUNDING HIV/
AIDS RESEARCH
HON. DAVID B. McKINLEY
OF WEST VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Speaker, as a
member of the Congressional HIV/AIDS Cau-
cus, I rise today in support of provisions of the
Labor-H Appropriations bill which would fund
President Trump’s initiative to end HIV/AIDS
by the year 2030.
Our nation is facing a continuing HIV crisis
which has made its way into all of our commu-
nities and has destroyed the lives of too many
of our constituents. Significant progress has
been made in the fight against HIV/AIDS over
the past several decades, but the CDC reports
that over one million Americans still struggle
with this terrible disease. In 2019, this is sim-
ply unacceptable.
The Labor-H Appropriations bill being voted
on today includes many controversial matters
which are sure to guarantee it is dead on ar-
rival in the Senate. Despite this fact, the HIV/
AIDS provisions enjoy broad bipartisan sup-
port. It is my wish that we could come to-
gether as one body to pass beneficial, bipar-
tisan provisions which would make all Ameri-
cans better off.
We cannot set this issue to rest until HIV
has been fully eradicated from the United
States. The administration has made this
issue a priority and it is about time Congress
follows suit. Many of us have known family,
friends, or constituents who suffer from this
abominable disease. We owe it to all of them
to put aside our partisan differences and fund
the initiative to eradicate HIV/AIDS from the
United States by 2030.

Isidore Shapiro, on the occasion of his 100th
birthday this past February 2, 2019.
After graduating with a Master of Social
Work degree from the University of Pennsyl-
vania in 1952, Mr. Shapiro committed his ca-
reer to helping those who were struggling.
During his storied career of public service,
starting with serving as the Executive Director
of the Queens County Mental Health Society
and concluding as the first social worker to be
appointed Commissioner of the Nassau Coun-
try Department of Mental Health, Mental Re-
tardation, and Developmental Disabilities, Mr.
Shapiro continually displayed both compassion
and respect for the people he served and a
devotion to seeing them attain success. Dur-
ing my years as Special Assistant to the Chief
Deputy County Executive and then as County
Comptroller I worked closely with Isidore. He
is a true friend and dedicated public servant.
After his time as Commissioner, Mr. Sha-
piro, along with his loving wife Goldie, happily
retired to sunny Tuscan, Arizona. For his and
Goldie’s service to Nassau County, it is a
privilege to wish him a happy 100th birthday.

IN RECOGNITION OF POLICE CHIEF
WILLIAM H. HOLLINGSED
HON. MARK MEADOWS
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Police Chief William H.
Hollingsed of Haywood County, North Carolina
on his retirement from public service. I would
like to honor the service of Chief Hollingsed
and his significant impact on the town of
Waynesville and the great state of North Caro-
lina.
Chief Hollingsed’s career began with the Or-
ange County Sheriff’s Office in Orlando, Flor-
ida, where he served for 13 years as a mem-
ber of the SWAT team and achieved the rank
of Lieutenant. He then moved to North Caro-
lina, where he was appointed as the Chief of
Police at Western Carolina University. In 1999,
he became the Chief of Police for the
Waynesville Police Department where he has
selflessly served since.
Throughout his remarkable career, Chief
Hollingsed has served in numerous capacities.
He is an Executive Board member and former
President of the North Carolina Police Execu-
tives Association, he serves on the Attorney
General’s Law Enforcement Opioids Task
Force, the Task Force on Reforms for Opioid
Drug Convictions, and the North Carolina Joint
In-Service Training Committee. He further
serves as Chairman of the NC Criminal Jus-
tice Education and Training Standards Com-
mission, as Regional Director of the NC Asso-
ciation of Chiefs of Police, and as the Police
Chiefs representative for the Governor’s Im-
paired Driving Task Force. He was appointed
by the NC League of Municipalities as a mem-
ber of the Risk Management Assessment
Team. Dedicated to the safety of his commu-
nity, Chief Hollingsed was recently honored
with the North Carolina Dogwood Award.
In addition to his career, Chief Hollingsed is
dedicated to his wife, Karen, and their three
daughters. Furthermore, Chief Hollingsed has
served on a number of boards and commis-
sions, including Kids Advocacy Resource Ef-
fort (KARE), United Way, Salvation Army,
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers (MADD), Big
Brothers and Big Sisters, Child Abuse and Ne-
glect Task Force, Boy Scouts of America,
Waynesville Rotary Club, Domestic Violence
Task Force, Folkmoot Board, Criminal Justice
Partnership Program, and the Haywood Arts
Council.
Chief Hollingsed earned his Bachelor’s De-
gree in Criminal Justice from Columbia Univer-
sity and earned his Master’s of Public Admin-
istration Degree from Troy University. Desiring
to equip the next generation, Chief Hollingsed
has spent the last 20 years as an Adjunct Pro-
fessor of Criminal Justice at Western Carolina
University and is a member of the Haywood
Community College Board of Trustees.
It is my sincere honor to acknowledge Chief
Hollingsed for his hard work and selfless dedi-
cation to our country and his community. His
diligent pursuit of excellence is evident
through his 35 years of law enforcement, dedi-
cation to his family, and passion for serving
his community.

RECOGNIZING DEE SARTON
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON
OF IDAHO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the distinguished career of Dee
Sarton. Four decades ago, she started work-
ing at KTVB Channel 7 in Boise, Idaho. Ida-
hoans who live in both the Treasure Valley
and the Magic Valley know Dee as the face of
the evening news. She is the anchor on
KTVB’s 4 p.m., 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. newscasts.
But Dee is so much more than an anchor, she
is a friend of the community who cares deeply
about the people around her and it shows
every day.
Make no mistake, Dee is a compassionate
reporter, but she isn’t afraid to tackle hard hit-
ting news or ask the tough questions. Dee is
a great storyteller, and she tells stories about
people of Idaho. She asks the right questions
and is very engaging. When Dee talks, people
listen.
I’ve had the pleasure of knowing Dee
throughout my political career. I have always
appreciated her thoroughness when covering
a news topic and I will miss seeing her at
KTVB.
Not only is she an incredible news anchor,
Dee is also an Idaho Hall of Fame journalist
and a National Academy of Television Arts
and Sciences Silver Circle inductee and a
champion for children and education, serving
on numerous non-profit boards, including the
Special Needs Adoption Board of Directors,
Children’s Home Board, the Hidden Springs
Charter School Board, the Literacy Lab Advi-
sory Board and the Assistance League Com-
munity Advisory Council. Her weekly Wednes-
day’s Child feature helped hundreds of North-
west foster children find adoptive homes.
Congratulations to Dee. I am happy for her
and I know she will enjoy the next chapter in
her life.
WOMEN’S VETERANS DAY
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, on
June 12, 1948, President Harry S. Truman
signed into law the Women’s Armed Services
Integration Act, allowing women to serve as
regular members of the military.
On May 5, 2017, State Representative Vic-
toria Neave filed House Bill 2698, establishing
Women Veterans Day.
HB2698 was later incorporated into Texas
Senate Bill 805 and on June 9, 2017 was
signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott des-
ignating June 12th as Women Veterans Day.
I am honored to represent over 170,000 dis-
tinguished women veterans in the state of
Texas.
Moreover, I am proud to work alongside the
four women veterans serving in the 116th
Congress. On this day, it is imperative that we
highlight women’s role in the military and com-
memorate their valor and sacrifice.
It should be no secret that women play an
integral role in our nation’s armed forces.
They volunteer for the same reasons as
men, but their service can come at a steep
personal price.
4.3 percent of women in the military re-
ported being sexually assaulted in 2016.
Female veterans are three to four times
more likely than their civilian counterparts to
become homeless and 2.5 times more likely to
commit suicide.
Today’s events, in part, were designed to
help women veterans find resources.
I am in awe of the invaluable contributions
and unwavering commitment that women vet-
erans have given this country and my home
state.
I vow to continue my support of women and
men veterans alike in the House of Represent-
atives, as we owe all veterans our gratitude
and respect.
But on this Women Veterans Day in Texas,
I urge you to join me celebrate and work to
understand the sacrifices of women veterans
among us.

WORLD SCIENTISTS WARNING TO
HUMANITY: A SECOND NOTICE
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, climate
change is an existential threat to all of human-
ity, and it is essential that we start acting—
now—to stop and reverse the destructive ef-
fects of climate change.
In 2017, Oregon State University Professor
Dr. William Ripple published ‘‘World Scientists’
Warning to Humanity: A Second Notice,’’
which has been endorsed by more than
15,000 scientists from 184 countries. He out-
lined the irrefutable proof of the damage cli-
mate change has caused over the last twenty-
five years. He also provided effective steps we
can take to combat climate change.
I urge my colleagues to read his report and
take action before it is too late.

Twenty-five years ago, the Union of Con-
cerned Scientists and more than 1,500 sci-
entists, including the majority of living
Nobel laureates in the sciences, penned the
1992 ‘‘Scientists’ Warning to Humanity’’ (see
supplemental material). These scientists
called on humankind to curtail environ-
mental destruction and cautioned ‘‘a great
change in our stewardship of the Earth and
the life on it is required, if vast human mis-
ery is to be avoided.’’ In their manifesto,
they showed that humans were on a collision
course with the natural world. They ex-
pressed concern about current, impending, or
potential damage on planet Earth involving
ozone depletion, freshwater availability, ma-
rine fishery collapses, ocean dead zones, for-
est loss, biodiversity destruction, climate
change, and continued human population
growth. They proclaimed that fundamental
changes are urgently needed to avoid the
consequences our present course would
bring.
The authors of the 1992 declaration feared
humanity was pushing the Earth’s eco-
systems beyond their capacity to support the
web of life. They described how we are fast
approaching the many limits of what the
planet can tolerate without substantial and
irreversible harm. They pleaded that we sta-
bilize the human population, describing how
our large numbers—swelled by another 2 bil-
lion people since 1992, a 35% increase—exert
stresses on the Earth that can overwhelm
other efforts to realize a sustainable future
(Crist et al. 2017). They implored that we cut
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and phase
out fossil fuels, staunch deforestation, and
reverse the trend of collapsing biodiversity.
On the 25th anniversary of their call, we
look back at their warning and evaluate the
human response by exploring available time-
series data. Since 1992, with the exception of
stabilizing the stratospheric ozone layer, hu-
manity has failed to make sufficient
progress in generally solving these foreseen
environmental challenges and, alarmingly,
most of them are getting far worse (Figure 1,
supplemental table S1). Especially troubling
is the probability of catastrophic climate
change due to rising GHGs from burning fos-
sil fuels (Hansen et al. 2013), deforestation
(Malhi et al. 2008), and agricultural produc-
tion, particularly from farming ruminants
for meat consumption (Ripple et al. 2014).
Moreover, we have unleashed a mass extinc-
tion event, the sixth in roughly 540 million
years, wherein many current life forms could
be annihilated or at least committed to ex-
tinction by the end of this century.
Humanity is now being given a second no-
tice as illustrated by these alarming trends
(Figure 1). We are jeopardizing our future by
not reigning in our intense but highly un-
even material consumption and by not per-
ceiving continued rapid population growth as
a primary driver behind many ecological and
even societal threats (Crist et al. 2017). By
failing to adequately promote family plan-
ning, implement carbon taxes, incentivize
renewable energy, and set aside substantial
swaths of habitat in well-protected reserves,
humanity is not taking the urgent steps
needed to safeguard our imperiled biosphere.
As most political leaders respond to pres-
sure; scientists, media influencers, and lay
citizens must insist that their governments
take immediate action, as a moral impera-
tive to current and future generations of
human and other life. With a groundswell of
organized grassroots efforts, dogged opposi-
tion can be overwhelmed and political lead-
ers compelled to do the right thing. It is also
time to re-examine and change our indi-
vidual behaviours, including limiting our
own reproduction (to replacement level, at
most) and drastically diminishing our con-
sumption of fossil fuels, meat, and other re-
sources.
The rapid global decline in ozone-depleting
substances shows that we can make positive
change when we act decisively. We have also
made advancements in reducing extreme
poverty and hunger. Other notable progress
(which does not yet show up in the global
datasets in Figure 1) includes: the rapid de-
cline in fertility rates in some regions at-
tributable to investments in girls’ and wom-
en’s education, the promising decline in the
rate of deforestation in parts of the Amazon
(which might still be reversed), and the rapid
growth in the renewable-energy sector. We
have learned much since 1992, but the ad-
vancement of urgently needed changes in en-
vironmental policy and human behavior is
still far from sufficient.
Sustainability transitions come about in
diverse ways and all require civil-society
pressure and evidence-based advocacy, polit-
ical leadership, and a solid understanding of
policy instruments, markets and other driv-
ers. A dozen examples of diverse and effec-
tive steps humanity can take to transition
to sustainability include: 1) prioritizing the
enactment of connected reserves for a sig-
nificant proportion of the world’s terrestrial
and marine habitats, 2) maintaining nature’s
ecosystem services by halting conversion of
forests, grasslands, and other native habi-
tats; 3) rewilding regions with native species,
especially apex predators, to repair damaged
ecosystems; 4) developing and adopting ade-
quate policy instruments to redress the cur-
rent poaching crisis and the exploitation and
trade of threatened species; 5) reducing food
waste through education and better infra-
structure; 6) promoting dietary shift towards
mostly plant-based foods; 7) further reducing
fertility rates by ensuring women have ac-
cess to education, family-planning services,
especially where such resources are still
lacking; 8) increasing outdoor nature edu-
cation for children; 9) developing progressive
tax incentives for reducing overconsump-
tion; 10) reducing the consumption rate of
raw commodities by banning planned obso-
lescence of goods; 11) devising and promoting
new green technologies and massively adopt-
ing renewable energy sources; and 12) esti-
mating a scientifically defensible, sustain-
able human population size for the long-term
while rallying nations and leaders to support
that vital goal.
To prevent widespread misery and cata-
strophic biodiversity loss, humanity must
practice a more environmentally sustainable
alternative to business-as-usual. This pre-
scription was well articulated by the world’s
leading scientists twenty-five years ago, but
in most respects, we have not heeded their
warning. It is about to be too late to shift
course away from our failing trajectory, and
time is running out. We must recognize, in
our day-to-day lives and in our governing in-
stitutions, that the Earth with all its life is
our only home.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE LIFE,
LEGACY, AND SERVICE OF MR.
RICHARD GENAL
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I
rise in honor of the life, legacy, and service of
Mr. Richard Genal.
Mr. Genal graduated from Appleton High
School in 1959. Feeling the call to serve his
country, he enlisted in the United States Army.
Under the buddy program, he completed basic
training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. After
further training at Fort Ord, California, he
began active duty on June 22, 1959 as a con-
struction draftsman.
Mr. Genal served many assignments in the
U.S. during his time on active duty, including
stations at Fort Belvoir and Fort Lee in Vir-
ginia. On July 23, 1960 he married Mary Lou
Gerth, and they had two children, Eugene and
Rene. While in service, he was diagnosed with
myxedema and discharged with a 10 percent
disability rating on August 8, 1962.
Following Mr. Genal’s discharge, he
furthered his education and graduated from
the Milwaukee School of Engineering with a
master’s degree. After successful careers with
Master Lock in Milwaukee and Nu-Line Indus-
tries in Suring, Mr. Genal retired from being an
engineer and started enjoying life on the golf
course.
Even though Mr. Genal removed the uni-
form, his service did not end. Mr. Genal was
involved in many veteran organizations. Vets 4
Vets of Northeast Wisconsin, an organization
with a mission to foster a sense of support,
pride, and enthusiasm among veterans in
Oconto County, became his passion. Before
his death, Mr. Genal started plans for a flag
memorial at Riverside Park in Suring. To
honor Richard’s legacy, Vets 4 Vets of North-
east Wisconsin will carry out his mission and
see the memorial through fruition.
On April 23, 2019, Richard Lee Genal of
Suring, Wisconsin left our lives to be with his
heavenly Father and family.
Madam Speaker, it is truly an honor to rec-
ognize Mr. Genal’s selfless service to our
country. His love for his country, veterans and
community will always be remembered. I offer
my sincerest condolences to his family.

HONORING DR. JOSÉ SIMÓN VILLA
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor Dr. José Simón Villa, an
educator, philanthropist, and leader.
Dr. Villa is a proud native of San Juan,
Texas. José became the first in his family to
graduate from college when he earned his
bachelors degree from the University of Or-
egon. Dr. Villa went on to complete his Ph.D.
in educational administration at the Ohio State
University. His dissertation research focused
on the educational aspirations and opportuni-
ties of migrant youth and children. Dr. Villa
served many years in higher education at
Ohio State as the Assistant Vice Provost for
the Office of Minority Affairs, Director of the
College Assistant Migrant Program, and Pro-
gram Coordinator for Hispanic Affairs. Addi-
tionally, he has served as Program Consultant
for the U.S. Department of Education and as
an Educational Consultant and State Director
of Migrant Education for the Ohio Department
of Education.
Furthermore, Dr. José Simón Villa has
served as the Chief Executive Officer of the
East Coast Migrant Head Start Project
(ECMHSP) for the past five years. The
ECMHSP is the largest Migrant and Seasonal
Head Start provider in the country with 38
centers across the area from Lake Okee-
chobee in Florida to Lake Erie in Pennsyl-
vania. It is a non-profit organization that advo-
cates for farm worker communities and pro-
vides quality Head Start services to young
children. Under the leadership of Dr. Simón
Villa, the ECMHSP has helped over 10,000
children and has expanded further into Florida
to include Palmetto and Jennings.
Madam Speaker, Dr. José Simón Villa has
worked tirelessly to give migrant families and
children the opportunities they need to suc-
ceed. He serves as both a light in our commu-
nity and as a generous leader. It is an honor
to represent a dedicated and selfless indi-
vidual who has greatly impacted the edu-
cational journey of thousands of children
across the United States. I wish Dr. Villa the
best in his future endeavors.

TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE
ROGER CLECKLEY
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN
OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor a dedicated public servant and
dear friend, Roger Cleckley. Roger is a man
driven by faith, duty and honor. He has spent
most of his career in public service and all of
us are the beneficiaries of his tremendous
commitment to building a better community,
state and nation.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, ‘‘ev-
erybody can be great . . . because anybody
can serve . . . you only need a heart full of
grace and a soul generated by love.’’ By that
definition, Roger Cleckley is among the great-
est among us.
Roger is a native of the Cope-Cordova com-
munity of Orangeburg County, South Carolina.
He was the third of four children born to Sol-
omon and Celia Mae Cleckley. He attended
G.W. Carver High School and Voorhees Col-
lege both in Denmark, South Carolina. He has
also earned a Certificate of Leadership Train-
ing from the University of South Carolina.
He began his commitment to service by
joining the United States Army. He served a
tour of duty in Vietnam as a combat infantry-
man. His distinguished service earned him nu-
merous awards and medals. After two years
on active duty, Roger received an honorable
discharge with the rank of Sergeant (E–5).
A veteran of the Civil Rights Movement,
Roger never shies away from standing up for
what he believes is right. After returning from
Vietnam and a year in Washington, D.C., he
took a job with Tepeck Industries in St. Mat-
thews, South Carolina, and quickly discovered
that racial injustice in his home state were still
prevalent. He fought against these injustices in
his workplace, which ultimately resulted in his
dismissal from the company.
Undeterred, Roger found work selling insur-
ance at the A.L. Williams Insurance Company
and became active in the NAACP. In 1986, he
felt the call to public service and ran for
Orangeburg County Auditor. His hard-won vic-
tory made him the first African American elect-
ed to serve in this capacity in South Carolina
since the post-Reconstruction era. When I of-
fered for Congress in 1992, Roger and his
wife hosted my maiden community event in
their home and he became my Orangeburg
County Chairman. When Roger retired he held
the distinction as the longest serving local
elected official in Orangeburg County.
Over the years, Roger has tirelessly worked
for his church and community and has been a
relentless voice for the voiceless. He is pres-
ently Chairman of the Forfeited Land Commis-
sion, Secretary of the Orangeburg County Fis-
cal Education Commission, and Chairperson
of the County Democratic Party Nominations
Committee.
Roger has held many positions in the Afri-
can Methodist Episcopal Church from Sunday
School, Steward Board, Class Leader, and the
Lay Organization. He is currently the outgoing
Seventh Episcopal District Lay Organization
President, which comprises the entire state of
South Carolina.
His wife, Bessie Idella Cleckley, has been
his partner and soul mate for fifty years. She
has always been a tremendous source of en-
couragement to him as he served the people
of South Carolina. They are the parents of
sons, Roger ‘‘Al,’’ Adrian, and Kendrick, and
the grandparents of five.
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my col-
leagues join me in offering congratulations and
sincere gratitude to Mr. Roger Cleckley on the
occasion of his retirement. His extraordinary
work has had a profound impact on all who
have been touched by his selfless service. I
believe he exemplifies the sentiment found in
Matthew 25:23, ‘‘well done, my good and faith-
ful servant,’’ and I offer my best wishes as he
embarks on this new phase of his life.

HONORING BETTY DEAN AND HER
SERVICE AS CHAIRMAN OF THE
PRINCE WILLIAM CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the accomplishments of outgoing
Chairman of the Prince William Chamber of
Commerce, Betty Dean and to thank her for
her immeasurable contributions to Prince Wil-
liam County businesses and residents.
In 2000, Betty moved to Occoquan in Prince
William County from Delaware. For nearly 20
years she has given much back to our com-
munity through her advocacy, volunteerism,
and desire to leave a positive impact in the
county. Betty joined the Prince William Cham-
ber in 2001, and she has been one of the
most active members since that time. She
spent nearly two decades in marketing re-
search and planning, but most importantly,
she worked diligently to strengthen business-
to-business ties and business-to-community
ties. In 2016, she started Betty Dean & Asso-
ciates, which provides marketing and strategic
planning advocacy services for nonprofits and
small businesses. Due to the success of her
business, her active community involvement,
and continued work in the Chamber, she was
elected Chairman of the Chamber in July of
2018.
Betty said that as Chairman she wanted to
be a vocal advocate for the business commu-
nity and continue encouraging chamber mem-
bers to do business with one another. Through
her leadership the Chamber did just that, and
her hard work did not go unnoticed. This year
she was named one of Prince William’s Most
Influential Women by Prince William Living, a
well-deserved recognition of her leadership in
empowerment and commitment to service and
our community. She is truly one of the most
influential persons in both the county and the
Northern Virginia region. Betty is a pillar of the
community and we thank her for her service to
the Prince William Chamber.
Betty’s dedication to improving our commu-
nity has extended far beyond the Chamber.
She is the immediate past president and cur-
rent president of the Greater Prince William
Coalition for Human Services, is the co-found-
er and president of Occoquan River Commu-
nities, serves as a member of the board of di-
rectors and chair of the communications com-
mittee of People, Inc., and is past secretary
and service chair of the Rotary Club of Lake
Ridge. She is fondly known as the ‘‘Queen of
the Occoquan,’’ a title she has earned through
her advocacy.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in thanking and congratulating Betty Dean
on a successful term as Chairman of the
Prince William Chamber of Commerce. I com-
mend her for her efforts on behalf of the busi-
ness community and County and wish her
continued success.

WILLIAM CHAMBER OF COM-
MERCE VALOR AWARD RECIPI-
ENTS OF THE MANASSAS VOL-
UNTEER FIRE COMPANY
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the Manassas Volunteer Fire Com-
pany and its outstanding members who have
demonstrated superior dedication to public
safety and are the 2019 recipients of the pres-
tigious Prince William Chamber of Commerce
Merit Award and Valorous Unit Award for their
service. The annual Prince William Chamber
of Commerce Valor Awards recognize remark-
able heroism and bravery above and beyond
the line of duty exemplified by our public safe-
ty and law enforcement professionals.
For the past 33 years, the Prince William
Chamber of Commerce has paid tribute to our
firefighters, police officers, and emergency
personnel for their extraordinary service.
These brave men and women put their lives at
risk on a daily basis to keep our families and
neighborhoods safe. These dedicated service
members of a combination career and volun-
teer system fight fires, provide emergency
medical services, perform rescues, and work
in our community to promote fire safety and
prevention. In recognition of their acts of valor,
it is my honor to include in the RECORD the fol-
lowing names of the Manassas Volunteer Fire
Company public safety personnel:
Bronze Medal for Valor: Firefighter Terry
Norling.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing the 2019 Prince William
Chamber of Commerce Valor Award recipients
of the Manassas Volunteer Fire Company.
The selfless acts of heroism by this distin-
guished group of men and women truly merits
our highest praise. I thank each honoree, as
well as all the Manassas Volunteer Fire Com-
pany public safety professionals for their dedi-
cation and commitment to the protection of our

VALOR AWARD RECIPIENTS
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize an outstanding group of
men and women in Northern Virginia. These
individuals have demonstrated superior dedi-
cation to public safety and have been awarded
the prestigious Valor Award by the Northern
Virginia Chamber of Commerce.
This is the 41st Annual Valor Awards spon-
sored by the Northern Virginia Chamber of
Commerce. This event honors the remarkable
heroism and bravery in the line of duty exem-
plified by our public safety officers. Our public
safety and law enforcement personnel put
their lives on the line every day to keep our
families and neighborhoods safe. This year’s
ceremony will present 123 awards to recog-
nize extraordinary actions above and beyond
the call of duty in a variety of categories in-
cluding the Lifesaving Certificate, the Certifi-
cate of Valor, and the Bronze and Silver

MPO Neil Patrick Shaw of the Town of Vi-
enna Police Department is being awarded the
Certificate of Valor this year for his exceptional
service in the line of duty. It is with great pride
that I include in the RECORD his name.
Madam Speaker, I congratulate the 2019
Valor Award Recipients, and thank all of the
men and women who serve in the Town of Vi-
enna Police Department. Their efforts, made
on behalf of the citizens of our community, are
selfless acts of heroism and truly merit our
highest praise. I ask my colleagues to join me

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE NORTHERN VIR-
GINIA REGIONAL COMMISSION
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the Northern Virginia Regional Com-
mission on its 50th anniversary. This momen-
tous occasion carries great significance for
me, as I served as Chairman of the NVRC
during my time as Chairman of the Fairfax
County Board of Supervisors.
Serving on a regional board or commission
is a unique responsibility and can place a poli-
tician in an unusual position: advocating for
and working for someone else’s constituents.
More often than not, you have to travel out-
side of the district or community that you rep-
resent and you have to make decisions that
balance the interests of the region, not just
your constituents. It can often be a thankless
task, but it is so important to the continued
long-term health and viability of our community
as a whole. That’s why it is so critical that we
continue to plan at the regional level and be-
yond. Indeed, in Northern Virginia, part of the
reason why we enjoy such a high quality of
life is because we have placed such a high
emphasis on coordination and planning at the
regional level. That emphasis goes back dec-
ades, as evidenced by this anniversary.
While there are many different ways that re-
gional planning has benefitted Northern Vir-
ginia, two areas in particular come to mind.
The first is the environment, where NVRC has
been an invaluable partner on a hosts of
projects including expanding solar power
through Solarize NoVa, protecting and main-
taining local water resources through the
Occoquan Basin Nonpoint Pollution Manage-
ment Program, and cleaning up and pre-
serving the Chesapeake Bay for future gen-
erations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E760 June 12, 2019
The Cool Counties Initiative to help address
climate change at the local level and the de-
velopment of a regional energy strategy were
other important elements in that ongoing
struggle. All of these initiatives have improved
our quality of life and ensured that future gen-
erations can continue to have that same qual-
ity of life that we currently enjoy.
Another area we have seen a tremendous
return on investment is in demographic re-
search. NVRC was among the first regional
bodies to seriously study the coming demo-
graphic changes to our region. When I first
moved to Fairfax County, the population was
3 percent foreign-born. Today that number is
over 30 percent. This diversity has become
one of Fairfax County and Northern Virginia’s
greatest strengths. However, such a rapid de-
mographic change in a relatively short time
period could have led to serious disruptions if
the region’s infrastructure was not prepared to
accommodate it. Thanks to cutting-edge re-
search by NVRC, we were able to foresee
these changes and plan to accommodate
them as they occurred.
Madam Speaker, bodies like NVRC are a
testament to good government and all of the
benefits that good government can bring. I
commend my colleagues on NVRC and all the
other regional boards and commissions in the
National Capital Region for the work they do
every day on behalf of the greater good. I ask
my colleagues in this body to join me in con-
gratulating NVRC on its 50th anniversary and
in thanking them for their continued service to
all our communities.

Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commend the 2019 Northern Virginia
District PTA Annual Award recipients. Parent
Teacher Associations (PTAs) and Parent
Teacher Student Associations (PTSAs) in
Northern Virginia serve a critical role in help-
ing to provide the best possible educational
environment for our students.
The Northern Virginia District PTA rep-
resents a region with 225 schools representing
over 50,000 members. Maintaining a healthy
and strong organization is an important part of
allowing these groups to have the greatest
possible impact on the students they serve. To
encourage such strength, it is important to
note the individual PTAs that excel in this mis-
sion, as well as the individual Volunteers of
the Year.
I am pleased to congratulate the following
PTAs and individuals on being recognized by
the Northern Virginia District PTA for their im-
measurable contributions to the education of

member of the Fairfax County Board of Super-
visors selects two people from his or her dis-
trict who have demonstrated outstanding vol-
unteer service, heroism, or other exceptional
commitments and contributions to our commu-
nity. Since the program’s inception in 1984,
approximately 600 individuals have earned the
honor of being named a Lord or Lady Fairfax
by his or her representative on the Board of
Supervisors
This year, the Fairfax County Board of Su-
pervisors will recognize those individuals who
have made tremendous impacts through their
support of our public schools, parks, youth
sports leagues, arts community, public safety,
and human service programs. It is nearly im-
possible to fully describe the diversity of ac-
complishments of the honorees. Their efforts
contribute greatly to the quality of life for the
residents of Fairfax County and are worthy of
our praise and sincere appreciation.
It is my honor to include in the RECORD the
names of the 2019 Lords and Ladies Fairfax:

nearly 2 million members of the VFW and its
Auxiliaries contribute more than 8.6 million
hours of volunteerism in the community, in-
cluding participation in Make A Difference Day
and National Volunteer Week.
With approximately 600 Comrades and 150
Ladies Auxiliary members, the Springfield
VFW Post 7327 stands out for the depth of its
commitment to our community. Often called
‘‘The Friendliest VFW Post in Virginia,’’ Post
7327 has one of the most aggressive ADOPT-
A UNIT programs in the entire VFW organiza-
tion to support our service members stationed
overseas. VFW Post 7327 visits the VA hos-
pital at least quarterly, bringing along goodie
bags for our Wounded Warriors. Each Thanks-
giving and Christmas, VFW Post 7327 adopts
military families in need through the USO and
provides them with meal baskets for each holi-
day, gifts for children, commissary cards for
the parents, and a Christmas party where the
children can meet Santa and receive a gift-
filled stocking. The Ladies Auxiliary members
collect, sort, and distribute more than 2,000
pieces of clothing each month to various chari-
table organizations.
VFW Post 7327 is a strong supporter of
local youth organizations including the Boys
Scouts, Girl Scouts, and Little League Base-
ball that contribute greatly to the education

RECOGNIZING THE 2019 PRINCE
WILLIAM CHAMBER OF COM-
MERCE VALOR AWARD RECIPI-
ENTS OF THE PRINCE WILLIAM
COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF FIRE
AND RESCUE
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the Prince William County Depart-
ment of Fire and Rescue and its outstanding
members who have demonstrated superior
dedication to public safety and are the 2019
recipients of the prestigious Prince William
Chamber of Commerce Merit Award and Val-
orous Unit Award for their service. The annual
Prince William Chamber of Commerce Valor
Awards recognize remarkable heroism and
bravery above and beyond the line of duty ex-
emplified by our public safety and law enforce-
ment professionals.
For the past 33 years, the Prince William
Chamber of Commerce has paid tribute to our
firefighters, police officers, and emergency
personnel for their extraordinary service.
These brave men and women put their lives at
risk on a daily basis to keep our families and
neighborhoods safe. For fire and rescue per-
sonnel, no two days are alike. Always on the
front lines, the Prince William County Depart-
ment of Fire and Rescue is comprised of three
sections: community safety, operations, and
support systems. Dedicated service members
of a combination career and volunteer system
fight fires, provide emergency medical serv-
ices, perform rescues, and work in our com-
munity to promote fire safety and prevention.
The Department of Fire and Rescue was
founded in 1966, when just about 50,000 peo-
ple lived in Prince William County. Through
the years, the Department has had to continu-
ously adapt as the population rapidly ex-
panded to over 430,000 people. Yet, our Fire
and Rescue department continues to provide
high quality and efficient firefighting and emer-
gency medical services to our community.
They provide around the clock services from
22 fire stations in a county spanning 348
square miles.
In recognition of their acts of valor, it is my
honor to include in the RECORD the following
names of the Prince William County Depart-
ment of Fire and Rescue public safety per-
sonnel:
Merit Award for Valor: Technician I Cody
Durham, Lieutenant Nick Feliciano, Technician
II Chris Gott, Lieutenant Kenneth Zack.
Valorous Unit: Technician II Christopher
Clark, Technician II Daniel Jackson, Techni-
cian I Kevin Ganssle, Technician I Michael
Baker, Captain Brian Ferguson, Technician I
Victor Vega, Technician I Aldo Bonilla, Techni-
cian I Michael Chergosky.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing the 2019 Prince William
Chamber of Commerce Valor Award recipients
of the Prince William County Department of
Fire and Rescue. The selfless acts of heroism
by this distinguished group of men and women
truly merits our highest praise. I thank each
honoree, as well as all Prince William County
Department of Fire and Rescue public safety
professionals for their dedication and commit-
ment to the protection of our communities.

RECOGNIZING THE SHEPHERD’S
CENTER OF OAKTON-VIENNA
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 12, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the Shepherd’s Center of Oakton-
Vienna and to thank them for their many con-
tributions to the Northern Virginia community.
Organized in 1997, the Shepherd’s Center of
Oakton-Vienna (SCOV) is a non-profit that
provides services to help older adults continue
living independently, and it offers programs
that supply opportunities for enrichment, learn-
ing, and socialization. Services are available
free of charge to anyone age 50 or older who
resides in the local community.
Last year, 250 volunteers provided 3,000
hours of service to the Northern Virginia com-
munity. Volunteer drivers provided more than
900 round-trip rides for medical reasons and
other errands. Volunteers also made regular
contact with individuals who may have limited
interaction and may feel isolated in their
homes. ‘‘Handy Helpers’’ made minor home
repairs to help older adults keep their homes
safe and livable. The Health Team provided
individual health counseling, referral to com-
munity resources, and blood pressure read-
ings. Volunteers also run programs such as
Lunch n’ Life, Adventures in Learning, trips
and outings, special events, and caregivers’
support groups. In 2014, SCOV was recog-
nized for these efforts as an Outstanding Vol-
unteer Caregiving Program by the National
Volunteer Caregiving Network.
The services and programs offered by this
extraordinary organization help to ensure that
our seniors stay connected to the community
through the promotion of active lifestyles, on-
going social integration, and availability of re-
sources for older residents to use and share
their experience, training, and skills. This year,
a number of volunteers are receiving awards
for their dedicated service to the community
through the Shepherd’s Center and its pro-
grams. It is my honor to include in the RECORD
the names of the following individuals:
Bob Abbott, Jean Bastien, Marsha Komandt,
Jerry O’Shaughnessy, Lynn Rafferty, Lynn
Rhoads, Burt Sharp, Wanda Snuggs, Kathy
Tugenhadt, Pat Wood.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
join me in thanking the many volunteers who
generously dedicate their time and efforts to
the welfare of our neighbors. The value of
their contributions cannot be overstated and
are truly deserving of our highest praise.
