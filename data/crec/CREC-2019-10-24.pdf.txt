PRAYER
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick

Eternal God, we give You thanks for
giving us another day. You endow all
Your people with gifts of various de-
signs, meant to be used in service to
others. May the pressures that come to
bear upon the Members of Congress not
obscure honest self-reflection and eval-
uation of the gifts that each has to
bring to the needs of this time in the
people’s House.
Bless all Members with a sense of
their collective responsibility to our
Nation and to this assembly so that the
American people might have a renewed
respect and trust in those whom they
have elected.
As the House attends to the farewell
of a beloved colleague, may we be truly
grateful for the service of Elijah Cum-
mings, that of all who have served
since our Nation’s inception, and the
service and sacrifices of those who
serve now in the 116th Congress.
May all that is done today, and in
the days to come, be for Your greater
honor and glory.
Amen.

f
NOMINATION OF JUSTIN REED
WALKER
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
later today, the Senate will have the
opportunity to confirm another bril-
liant nominee to the Federal judiciary.
In this case, I am proud to say this new
lifetime judge will be another fine Ken-
tuckian.
For those of us who know Justin
Walker and have seen his work up
close, it is clear that President Trump
made an outstanding choice to be a dis-
trict judge for the Western District of
Kentucky.
Mr. Walker has sharpened his legal
skills at the highest levels, including
premier clerkships to then-Judge Brett
Kavanaugh of the DC circuit and
former Justice Anthony Kennedy.
As a prominent attorney and law pro-
fessor, he has earned the respect of his
peers in the legal world and of the com-
munity that he will serve on the bench.
For his students, Mr. Walker has
been a mentor who helps push them to
fulfill their potential in the classroom
and throughout their legal careers.
His thoughtful and deliberate ap-
proach fit the mold of a Federal judge
who—imagine this—will uphold the
laws and the Constitution as they are
actually written, not as he might wish
them to be.
So I am confident Mr. Walker will
serve our Commonwealth and the coun-
try extremely well as a district judge.
I look forward to voting to confirm
him, and I certainly urge my col-
leagues to join me.
f
OPIOID EPIDEMIC
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on another matter, too many times I
have had to come to the floor to speak
about the pain inflicted on families and
entire communities by opioid addiction
and substance abuse.
It is a crisis present in every ZIP
Code, one that has wrecked lives
throughout our country.
My home State of Kentucky has been
hit particularly hard, but I am relieved
to say that we are seeing at least a
glimmer of hope on the horizon.
This past summer brought news of
the first nationwide decrease—de-
crease—in overdose fatalities in almost
three decades. Kentucky saw a nearly
15-percent drop. After so much suf-
fering, this is an indication that the
tide may be starting to turn.
The result has been hard-won, after
years of coordinated efforts between
States, localities, and Washington. It
has been a nationwide response, and we
in Congress, along with the Trump ad-
ministration, have been focused on
doing our part.
Today marks the 1-year anniversary
of one key part of our ongoing efforts.
One year ago today, President Trump
signed into law our landmark opioid
legislation that will hopefully spare
more families from the pain of addic-
tion.
This legislation included work from 5
different committees and 70 Senators.
Thanks to Chairman LAMAR ALEX-
ANDER and so many of our colleagues,
this significant package focused on
providing innovative solutions, pro-
moting long-term recovery, and em-
powering local leaders and first re-
sponders out on the frontlines.
A little more than a year ago, it
passed the Senate with overwhelming

bipartisan support. I am proud that
two of my own bills were included in
that package. The Protecting Moms
and Infant Act safeguards of the addic-
tion crisis from its heartbreaking con-
sequences, and the CAREER Act ad-
dresses the major role that stable em-
ployment plays in long-term recovery.
It encourages treatment facilities to
form partnerships with local businesses
and short-term housing facilities to
‘‘hand up’’ to those who need it.
We are proud of what we accom-
plished a year ago, and I am proud that
my Kentucky colleague, Representa-
tive ANDY BARR, is leading the push for
the CAREER Act’s companion legisla-
tion over in the House.
But we know all too well that, unfor-
tunately, this work is far, far from fin-
ished. That is why, this very week, the
Senate is moving forward $25 million
more for the CAREER Act’s transi-
tional housing pilot program in the do-
mestic appropriations we are advanc-
ing here on the floor.
The work will not stop there. This
fight has been one of my top priorities
since I became majority leader. We
have put cutting-edge tools into the
hands of healthcare professionals and
first responders who face this crisis
every single day.
In my State alone, I helped secure an
unprecedented $200 million to address
the urgent crisis facing Kentuckians—
a funding increase of more than 400
percent on this issue for Kentucky
since I became majority leader.
We have committed to a comprehen-
sive strategy of prevention, treatment,
and enforcement efforts. At my invita-
tion, the White House drug czar, Jim
Carroll, saw some of Kentucky’s inno-
vative leadership firsthand when he
visited this past April. We have pushed
the boundaries of research to find new
ways to treat addiction and help fami-
lies escape its painful consequences.
Earlier this month I joined Secretary
Azar, NIH Director Collins, and an all-
star research team at the University of
Kentucky to celebrate the largest Fed-
eral grant in the University of Ken-
tucky’s history. These new resources
will fuel UK’s bold commitment to cut-
ting overdose deaths by 40 percent in 16
counties over the coming 3 years. I was
proud to help secure those funds.
Kentucky is proud that we are lead-
ing the national response, but I know
my colleagues each have their own in-
spiring stories of how States are fight-
ing back.
As I said, the work is far from over,
but today we take a moment to cele-
brate the progress of the past year. To
help mark this anniversary, the First
Lady of the United States joined us
here in the Senate yesterday.
I am proud to stand with her and the
Trump administration and my col-
leagues in this body as we recommit
ourselves to this effort.
f
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
this anniversary also reminds us of
how many urgent issues are crying out
for substantive, bipartisan, bicameral
cooperation for the good of the Amer-
ican people.
I am talking about funding our
Armed Forces and the Department of
Defense, just as both sides agreed to do
back in the summer when we signed on
to a bipartisan, bicameral budget
agreement that Democrats have lately
sort of wandered away from—just wan-
dered right away from it.
I am talking about passing the
USMCA, the most consequential up-
date to North American trade policy in
a generation, which Speaker PELOSI
has put on ice in order to move Demo-
crats’ impeachment obsession to the
front burner, despite the fact that
there are 176,000 new American jobs on
the line if we pass the USMCA.
The needs of the American people
have not been put on pause just be-
cause Washington Democrats have de-
cided it doesn’t suit them to get along
with the White House.
My friends in Democratic leadership
insist over and over that their focus on
undoing the 2016 election will not keep
them from the substantive legislation
that American families need. Well, our
Armed Forces are still waiting for
their funding; our workers and small
businesses are still waiting on their
new trade agreement.
Our Senate Democratic colleagues
have enough time to push partisan res-
olutions, such as their effort yesterday
to enact a new tax cut—listen to this—
their effort yesterday to enact a new
tax cut for wealthy people in blue
States, like New York and New Jersey,
at the expense of working families ev-
erywhere else.
But so far we have seen little—lit-
tle—indication that they are really
ready to put our differences aside and
come to the table on significant bipar-
tisan subjects that can actually be-
come law.
I worry that something like the land-
mark opioid package that we are cele-
brating today would not have moved
through the Congress today, just one
year later. I worry it would have been
another victim of Democrats’ decision
to avoid working with Republicans and
the White House on basically anything,
to keep all of their focus trained on im-
peachment.
I hope I am mistaken. I hope we
make real progress soon. The American
people are waiting on us.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized.
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
over the past few weeks, the House of
Representatives has continued to hear
testimony as part of its impeachment
inquiry, which stems from allegations
that President Trump pressured a for-
eign leader to investigate a domestic
political rival. These allegations were
deemed ‘‘credible’’ and an ‘‘urgent con-
cern’’ by the inspector general of the
intelligence community, who is a
Trump appointee. That is how this all
started, not with some Democrat stir-
ring the pot but with a Trump ap-
pointee, a very well-respected man,
saying that these allegations were
credible and urgent.
The public record—the public
record—shows that the White House
delayed more than $391 million in cru-
cial security assistance to Ukraine to
help the country stave off Russian ag-
gression. In a memorandum of the
President’s phone call with Ukrainian
President Zelensky, released by the
White House itself, the President re-
quested Ukraine undertake investiga-
tions that would benefit him politi-
cally.
Only a few days ago, as we all know,
the Chief of Staff to the President,
Mick Mulvaney, admitted publicly that
the administration held up security as-
sistance for the same political reasons.
Mr. Mulvaney, of course, later at-
tempted to retract his comments, but
his original statements were quite
clear, and I would say that anyone who
is not biased believed the original.
The White House continues to claim
that fighting corruption in Ukraine
was its only intent, but that is belied
by the fact that it has proposed mas-
sive cuts to the State Department’s
budget to fight corruption around the
world. On the one hand they say we

want Ukraine to fight corruption, and,
on the other hand, they cut in the
budget huge amounts of money aimed
at fighting corruption.
No one believes the President these
days on so many things, but this issue
is pretty clear. If you believe in fight-
ing corruption, you don’t cut the funds
to fight corruption and at the same
time pick out one country.
The facts are part of the public
record. They are deeply troubling, and
they come before Ambassador Taylor’s
testimony this week. By all accounts,
Mr. Taylor’s testimony was explosive
and undeniably credible, detailing a
pattern of activity that corroborated
the account provided by the whistle-
blower—this time from a career dip-
lomat, a West Point graduate who has
served every administration, Democrat
and Republican, since 1985.
Taylor is the kind of person Ameri-
cans admire—down the road, non-
political, served the country, West
Point, served Democrat and Republican
administrations ably well. But all of a
sudden, of course, he is an anathema
because he spoke truth to power. Presi-
dent Trump doesn’t like that, and our
Republican friends who cower before
President Trump don’t like it, but
Americans know what is going on.
Mr. Taylor’s written statement re-
ferred to additional documentation for
the events he described in his testi-
mony, notes and memos that are in the
custody of the State Department.
These records are part of a broader set
of documents that is under subpoena
by the House of Representatives, which
the State Department is refusing to
turn over to Congress. Yesterday, the
House issued a new request for Mr.
Taylor’s documents.
What is it, Trump administration?
What is it, Republicans? On the one
hand, you say you want everything to
be public when it comes to the hear-
ings, but you will not give up any docu-
ments. Pompeo will not come and tes-
tify. Again, the hypocrisy, the self-
serving nature of the President’s state-
ments and his Republican allies’ here
in the House and Senate are glaring:
We don’t want any sunlight when it
comes to documents, when it comes to
even bringing Secretary Pompeo here.
But all of a sudden, because they don’t
like what is being heard in the hear-
ings, we need everything public.
Well, one way or the other, I would
like to see everything public—these
documents—and the House has said
that they will have public testimony.
But the hypocrisy of our Republican
friends and of the President is glaring
on these issues.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo—
usually very eager to state what he
thinks boldly, he is ducking, he is run-
ning. He hasn’t explained this brazen
disregard for the law and defiance of
congressional oversight. Where is Sec-
retary Pompeo? The pattern of Presi-
dential misconduct alleged in the whis-
tleblower complaint runs straight
through his Department. It concerns
the most sensitive diplomatic interests
of the United States, our national secu-
rity, and the potential corruption of
foreign policy. Where is Representative
Pompeo?
We know people have disagreed and
had the guts to disagree with the Presi-
dent. General Mattis is at the top of
the list. We heard from Brett McGurk
yesterday. He is there. Probably John
Bolton is, too, even though I don’t
agree with his views on a whole lot of
stuff. We all know that Representative
Pompeo, when he was in the House,
would be incensed with this defiance of
congressional prerogatives. When he
ran the Benghazi hearings—many be-
lieve extremely unfairly, in a partisan
and biased way—he wanted everything
to come out. Now he is ducking. Now
he is hiding. We need Representative
Pompeo back here, the one who said
things should be made public, when it
was a different administration.
To make matters worse, not only is
Secretary Pompeo ducking, but maybe
he is complicit in all of this, because
his name has surfaced on multiple oc-
casions in the tale of the administra-
tion’s very questionable dealings with
Ukraine. For instance, Ambassador
Taylor’s written statement indicates
that on August 29, at the suggestion of
National Security Advisor John
Bolton, Mr. Taylor sent a first-person
cable directly to Secretary Pompeo re-
laying his concerns about the delay in
security aid. The State Department’s
stonewalling creates the appearance
that the Secretary is covering up not
only for the President but also for him-
self.
Without question, the State Depart-
ment documents described by Mr. Tay-
lor must be provided to Congress and
the stonewalling of Congress must end.
Secretary Pompeo must explain him-
self. He has too many questions to an-
swer about events that concern his De-
partment, his subordinates, and his ac-
tions. If he has any—any—regard for
his own reputation, he would do these
things.
Ideally, all Members of the House and
Senate would agree on the need for
Congress to see the full records here,
but yesterday, as we know, a rump
group of House Republicans stormed
the secure facility in the Capitol—
many with their cell phones in hand,
even though that is against the rules—
in an attempt to highlight the pur-
ported secrecy of the process. Some
Representatives reportedly asked—let
me repeat: asked—to be arrested.
It was an obvious and outrageous
breach of House rules and of the secu-
rity measures that exist to protect sen-
sitive information from our adver-
saries, even more so because it was so
transparently a stunt—a puerile, child-
ish stunt. It is not the kind of thing
that the House of Representatives—any
Member of the House of Representa-
tives—should stand for. The hypocrisy
of those who stormed the Chamber is
glaring. According to the reports, more
than one-third of the House Repub-
licans who stormed the SCIF—the
closed-off place that is secured—are
Members who were already allowed in
the closed hearings. They are allowed
to ask questions of witnesses and par-
ticipate in the factfinding. They know
as well as I do that there will be public
hearings in the future once the evi-
dence is gathered.
This is not about process; this is a di-
version. That is certain. This is be-
cause House Republicans do not like
the facts and want to suppress them.
That is the reason they are storming,
trying to create this childish, infantile
fuss. They don’t want to open up the
process; they want to shut it down.
If the White House and its congres-
sional allies truly wanted an open and
transparent process, the White House
would provide the documents Congress
requested. It wouldn’t defy subpoenas.
It wouldn’t forbid executive branch em-
ployees from testifying. You can’t just
flip a switch—one day, suppress evi-
dence, and the next, argue for a trans-
parent and open process. The hypoc-
risy, the self-interested dealing, is self-
evident.
Rather than stomp their feet in a fit
of staged political theater, House Re-
publicans—all Republicans—should
join us in getting all the facts. That is
what we ask for in this Chamber. We
are not prejudging the facts. We may
be a jury, but we want the facts to
come out, not some but all. That is our
responsibility, to get the facts out, all
of us. Matters as grave as the ones that
form the basis of the House impeach-
ment inquiry require us to put country
over party. That is what Democrats
will do. That is what Republicans must
do as well.
All the facts must come out. Those
who are attempting to obstruct this
factfinding inquiry may regret the day
they said all they want to do is open up
the process. Our Republican friends
may get what they wished for—all the
facts coming out. They will regret it
because, at least from reports, the
facts are very troubling.
TURKEY AND SYRIA
Madam President, yesterday, in an
address from the White House, Presi-
dent Trump announced he was can-
celing proposed sanctions against
Erdogan, this time after Assad,
Erdogan, and Putin got more than they
could ever hope for out of President
Trump’s abrupt decision to withdraw
U.S. troops from northern Syria. It was
another nonsensical and counter-
productive foreign policy decision by
President Trump. The notion that the
United States should trust Erdogan or
Assad or Putin to secure ISIS fighters
and sympathizers is not only delu-
sional, it is downright dangerous.
President Trump’s weakness in the
face of strongmen and his reckless de-
cisionmaking are putting the lives of
our partners and allies and Americans
at risk. As Assad, Erdogan, and Putin
exert more influence on the region, as
the Syrian Kurds are driven from the
region and killed, as ISIS-connected

detainees escape and regroup—many of
them planning to hurt us here in our
homeland—again, President Trump ar-
ticulates no plan to fix what he has
broken.
His top officials—Secretary of State
Pompeo and Secretary Esper—have
canceled two briefings with the Senate,
during which they were supposed to up-
date the Senate on the administra-
tion’s plan. I think they keep canceling
and ducking because they don’t have a
plan and wouldn’t know what to say.
That is very, very disturbing.
My Republican colleagues, please
stand up and speak out about the obvi-
ous dangers to our national security
that President Trump has invited.
Some, to their credit, have done so,
but others have gone so far as to ex-
cuse the President’s decision even if it
results in the ethnic cleansing of the
Kurds, our brave and former partners
in the fight against ISIS. That is not
right. Democrats and Republicans
must continue to press the President
to correct course in northern Syria and
quickly develop a plan of action to con-
tain ISIS and secure its enduring de-
feat.
NOMINATION OF JUSTIN REED WALKER
Madam President, on one last issue—
judges—today the Senate will consider
the nomination of Justin Walker of
Kentucky to serve a lifetime appoint-
ment on the Federal bench. Mr. Walker
is less than 10 years out of law school,
has never tried a case, has never served
as cocounsel, and it is not clear how
much of his 10 years has been spent
practicing law. Unsurprisingly, Mr.
Walker earned a rare ‘‘not qualified’’
rating by the American Bar Associa-
tion. Very few are called ‘‘not quali-
fied,’’ but he is one of them.
It seems the only reason Mr. Walker
has been nominated for an austere
judgeship is his membership in the
Federalist Society and his far-right-
wing views on healthcare, civil rights,
and Executive power.
Unfortunately, Mr. Walker is part of
a well-established pattern of Repub-
licans stacking the Federal bench with
manifestly unqualified judges. Another
brazen example is Steven Menashi, who
was slated to be considered in com-
mittee today before, thank God, it was
delayed. Mr. Menashi’s record of ex-
treme views is well documented. He
pushed Betsy DeVos’s anti-student
agenda at the Department of Education
and worked closely with Stephen Mil-
ler at the White House on policies that
harm immigrants. His past writings
show scorn for LGBTQ Americans and
women. Menashi’s conduct before the
Judiciary Committee was insulting, his
contempt for the Senate reprehensible,
and his refusal to be forthcoming about
his record should be outright disquali-
fying. Senators GRAHAM and KENNEDY,
in the committee, noted that his re-
fusal to answer questions was trou-
bling.
Folks like Mr. Walker and Mr.
Menashi have not earned the privilege
of a lifetime appointment to the bench.
I am glad that one of my Republican
colleagues has said they will oppose
Mr. Menashi’s nomination, and other
Republicans should follow suit on his
nomination and on Mr. Walker’s vote
today.
I yield the floor.

UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, we
are rapidly approaching the 1-year
mark since President Trump and the
Prime Minister of Canada and the
President of Mexico signed a new trade
agreement to strengthen our econo-
mies.
The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement,
or USMCA, will replace NAFTA, the
North American Free Trade Agree-
ment, or NAFTA, and continue to
guide trade with our northern and
southern neighbors in the future.
It is estimated by the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce that the number of jobs
in the United States that have been
created directly as a result of trade
with Mexico ranges around the 5 mil-
lion figure, with another 8 million from
binational with Canada, so this is no
small matter.
Since NAFTA was enacted in 1994, a
lot has changed. The way we commu-
nicate and the way we shop and even
go about our daily lives rely heavily on
technology that didn’t exist 25 years
ago.
Make no mistake—NAFTA has been
a huge benefit to our country, and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6139
October 24, 2019
Texas has arguably benefited more
than any other State. In 2018, Texas ex-
ported nearly $110 billion in goods to
Mexico, and we imported $107 billion
worth of goods from Mexico.
When you consider actions being
taken by China to counter our inter-
ests all over the world, our reliance on
North American partners has become
increasingly important. That only un-
derscores the need to ratify the
USMCA and strengthen our trading re-
lationship to ensure we are not left be-
hind as the global economy continues
to evolve.
The USMCA is the most significant
update to U.S. trade policy in a genera-
tion and will propel our growing econ-
omy into the 21st century. It takes into
account businesses and practices that
didn’t exist when NAFTA was created,
such as 2-day shipping, online micro-
retailers, and digital products like
eBooks and music. It also requires Can-
ada and Mexico to raise their de mini-
mis shipment value levels, meaning ad-
ditional classes of shipments can enter
all three countries with expedited
entry procedures. That is a big win for
small and medium-sized businesses,
which often lack the resources to pay
customs duties and taxes.
The USMCA prohibits restrictions on
the cross-border movement of data. It
increases goods market access. It sup-
ports small businesses. It boosts digital
trade and safeguards intellectual prop-
erty and supports agriculture. It also
keeps jobs here at home.
In short, this trade agreement is a
big win for the American people. Some
even argue that the USMCA is more
important than restoring our normal-
ized trading relationship with China.
Earlier this year, the International
Trade Commission provided insight
into what we could expect to see once
the USMCA is ratified. Within 6 years,
they say, we are looking at 176,000 new
American jobs and an increase in the
gross domestic product by more than
$68 billion. That is a bigger impact
than the Trans-Pacific Partnership
trade agreement.
The USMCA is expected to have a
positive impact on every industry sec-
tor in the U.S. economy. We can look
forward to a more than $43 billion in-
crease in exports and more than $31 bil-
lion in imports. That is great news for
North American workers, farmers,
ranchers, and business men and women
who will reap the benefits of this agree-
ment.
When I am meeting with my con-
stituents back home or here in Wash-
ington, one of the most common ques-
tions I get asked is, ‘‘When is the
USMCA going to pass?’’
Mexico has already ratified the
agreement, and Canada is waiting for
us to move before acting. The agree-
ment has broad support in the Senate,
and clearly the President is on board as
well. So the only holdup in the entire
process is the House of Representa-
tives.
Up until about a month ago, I told
my constituents that I thought the
prospects for passage sometime this
year were looking pretty good. House
Democrats did have some concerns, but
Speaker PELOSI was reportedly work-
ing in good faith with the administra-
tion to work through them. There were
indications of progress and productive
conversations with Mexico and Canada
to address their concerns as well.
It looked as though we were moving
along a path to a deal, but then the
House blew up all plans for a produc-
tive year in Congress. They marched
headlong into impeachment and tossed
aside important legislation. Forget
working on a trade deal that will ben-
efit every sector of the economy; House
Democrats are too busy conducting se-
cret hearings in an effort to force the
President—someone they despise—out
of office.
Whether they intend to allow the
USMCA to receive a vote in the House
is unknown, but I sincerely hope that
House Democrats have enough good
sense to avoid blowing up a vital trade
deal over political disagreements with
the President. As we all know, the clos-
er you get to an election, the more
challenging legislating actually be-
comes, and the clock is ticking away.
It is a shame that the House continues
to put politics ahead of good policy
that will benefit the entire American
people.
The USMCA is good for the economy,
good for business, good for workers,
and it sure is good for Texas. It is time
for the House to quit playing games so
we can ratify this trade agreement
without further delay.
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2625
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it has
been 21⁄2 weeks since the President an-
nounced he was abruptly withdrawing
U.S. forces from Syria—betraying our
Kurdish allies and derailing the inter-
national fight against ISIS in Syria.
In the course of one tweet, this Presi-
dent blindsided our allies in the re-
gion—yes, the Kurds—but the Israelis
and others as well. He blindsided our
diplomats and blindsided our military
from the top brass down to our forces
who serve on the ground. Frankly, the
only one who seemed to know that this
was coming was the Turkish President,
Mr. Erdogan.
As a result, brave men and women
who have fought alongside the United
States are now at risk of being slaugh-
tered by Turkish forces. Already, Kurd-
ish fighters and unarmed civilians have
been killed by Turkish armed groups—
militias. Already, hundreds of ISIS de-
tainees have escaped from prison, and
ISIS is being given the space and time
to regroup.
Simply put, we may be witnessing
one of the most significant counterter-
rorism setbacks in recent history.
With nowhere else to turn, the Kurds
have aligned themselves with the
Assad regime. That is good news for
one of history’s most brutal dictators—
a man who gases his own people. It is
also good news for his allies in Iran.
No one has, perhaps, benefited more
from this disaster than Vladimir Putin.
Just this week, Russia and Turkey
agreed to a new joint strategy in Syria,
green-lighting Russian and Syrian
forces to clear the border region of any
of our remaining Kurdish allies and,
unfortunately, expanding Russia’s foot-
print in the Middle East.
The truth is that I believe the Presi-
dent’s sudden withdrawal from Syria
without his having a plan and without
there being serious consideration for
our Kurdish allies is a disaster that
may haunt our foreign policy for dec-
ades to come.
If this is how the United States
treats its allies, how will anyone trust
the United States on a going-forward
basis?
Frankly, I fear most of the damage
may have already been done. No tweet,
no press conference, and no personal
assurance from Erdogan or anyone else
can rebuild the years of trust and
progress that have been destroyed. The
least we can do—and perhaps, unfortu-
nately, the most we can do—is to make
sure those Kurdish allies who served
alongside U.S. forces as translators and
in other military support roles are not
left to die in Syria.
That is why I have introduced the
Syrian Allies Protection Act. This leg-
islation is similar to programs in the
past which have granted special immi-
gration visas to Iraqi and Afghan na-
tionals who have served alongside U.S.
forces. The truth is these Kurdish al-
lies and their families are now at risk
because of their work with U.S. forces.
They are threatened not only by the
Turkish incursion but also by freed
ISIS fighters and Assad regime forces.
This legislation would provide per-
manent American residence to Syrian
nationals who have worked for the U.S.
Armed Forces for at least 6 months,
who have obtained a favorable rec-
ommendation from a general or a flag
officer in the chain of command, and
who have passed a thorough back-
ground check and screening.
The legislation also directs the ad-
ministration to evacuate eligible indi-
viduals to safety. If their lives are at

risk by remaining in Syria, they can
either be brought to the United States
or to a third country while appropriate
vetting takes place.
This legislation will not reverse what
we did to our Kurdish allies, but it will
show those who have worked with our
military forces—in many cases, we
have heard of translators and others
whom the American forces left without
having even said goodbye because they
had to withdraw so quickly—that the
American people appreciate the pro-
found sacrifices they have made in
their supporting U.S. forces in the
fight against ISIS. It would at least re-
move part of the sting.
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the
Committee on the Judiciary be dis-
charged of S. 2625 and the Senate pro-
ceed to its immediate consideration;
further, that the bill be considered read
a third time and passed; and that the
motion to reconsider be considered
made and laid upon the table with no
intervening action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Kentucky.
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, in reserv-
ing the right to object, ironically, the
Syrian Kurds may be closer to having
some degree of autonomy or homeland
than they have been in decades.
With the new arrangement—or rear-
rangement—of alliances, the Syrian
Kurds now will have an alliance with
someone who will remain in Syria.
Whether you like him or not, the Assad
government is there to stay. There was
never going to be a U.S. presence for
long enough or one great enough to
preserve or to create a homeland for
them. I think there is every possibility,
in alliance with Assad, that there will
be some Kurdish arrangement. It hap-
pened in Iraq. In Iraq, the oil proceeds
are shared. The Kurdish wanted more
in Iraq. They didn’t get as much as
they wanted, but they got some degree
of autonomy within their province.
I think that sort of encouraging the
Syrians Kurds to abandon their coun-
try is really premature and doesn’t
really recognize the fluidity of what is
going on on the ground there. There is
actually the potential, for the first
time in 8 years, to break through to a
peace agreement. Peace agreements
have been unable to be achieved in the
past because people have refused to ac-
knowledge that Assad is staying. It is
easy to say Assad is all of the things
that he likely is, but it is harder to ac-
knowledge that no matter who he is, he
is staying and that peace on the ground
will, ultimately, for the Syrian Kurds,
probably come through an arrange-
ment with Assad’s regime.
There has been a huge diplomatic
breakthrough. As much as we have all
of the talk of Sturm und Drang—that
the world is ending and there is going
to be a Kurdish genocide—perhaps the
opposite is going to happen. I don’t
think we yet know, as no one can pre-
dict the future with certainty, but it
actually looks as if there has been a
somewhat reasonable withdrawal. You
have the Syrian Kurdish generals now
saying they have agreed to the with-
drawal. There is now in place, hope-
fully, a long-term cease-fire.
So, while nothing is ever perfect in
Syria and while nothing is ever perfect
in the Middle East, I think, rather than
saying it is the end of the world, we
should say that this is a big transition,
that this is a big realignment of inter-
ests there, and that there is a possi-
bility that the Kurds could get a home-
land.
The last thing you would want is to
say to all of the leaders in the Kurdish
community, to all of the intellectuals,
to those who speak English, and to
those who are open to western ways,
‘‘Hey, come over here, and abandon
your country.’’ It would be equivalent
to France’s saying to George Wash-
ington during or after the war, ‘‘Hey,
guys. Hey, Founding Fathers. Why
don’t you all come to France?’’ It is
not a good notion to ask the leaders of
a country and a movement to leave and
abandon their country.
With that, I respectfully object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Virginia.
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I dis-
agree with my friend from Kentucky
about what may or may not happen.
I believe that one thing we agree
with him on is that we have not often
had well-organized plans in the Middle
East.
The unique thing about our alliance
with the Kurds was that after trying in
Iraq, Afghanistan, and other places
around the region to find allies who
would actually stand up and fight, in
the Kurds, we found those allies, and
they did a remarkable job dismantling
ISIS.
Now, the prognostication of the Sen-
ator from Kentucky I don’t agree with
it, but time will tell. The one area,
though, and what my legislation would
have done and where I am disappointed
we were not able to move forward on, is
regardless of the changed cir-
cumstances that the Assad regime may
have in terms of treating people with
more respect or the Turkish militias,
which we have already seen evidence of
their killing of Kurdish fighters, the
one group—the one group I think that
it is probably safe to say will be the
targets of both the Syrians, the
Turks—the militias—will be those
Kurdish individuals who worked di-
rectly for the U.S. military.
Even if the prognostication of the
Senator from Kentucky plays out on a
more macro basis, I don’t think anyone
with a straight face can say the Kurd-
ish translators, who 2 weeks ago were
working for the American forces, will
not be victims of—whether it be Turk-
ish, Syrian, Russian, or other—aggres-
sion.
I think it would have been the right
thing. I am going to continue to try to
find ways to bring this legislation to
the floor. I know it will be broadly bi-
partisan supported. I hope we will have
a chance to revisit this.
I don’t think we can ever fully re-
verse the actions this President has
taken, but at least in terms of these
transfers—I am not talking about tak-
ing the whole Kurdish leadership—but
these, generally, men who 2 weeks ago
were working for the American mili-
tary, I think we owe them a greater
debt of obligation than to simply say
good luck.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky.
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I think one
of the interesting things about the
Kurdish situation and about Syria in
general is how quickly the Kurds and
Assad actually did align.
If you watched the war over the last
8 years, the Kurds and Assad have
largely not fought each other. There
isn’t a great deal of the blood sort of
lust or curdling animosity between the
two, and it was actually pretty re-
markable how quickly they came to-
gether.
One of the things is we think we are
doing best, and we try to do the best
when we insert ourselves in the Middle
East, but sometimes we get unintended
consequences.
So we have been there. We want
peace, but we refuse to allow the Kurds
to talk to Assad. There is a stalemated
civil war that has gone on 8 years. Had
we never been involved, Assad likely
would have crushed the rebellion in 6
months, maybe 500,000 people wouldn’t
have died, maybe 3 million people
wouldn’t have left, and you would still
have a dictator.
Instead, we have 500,000 people dead,
3 million refugees, and we still have a
dictator.
So I think we need to question our
strategy as to what our intended goal
is and what ends up happening.
Syria is an utter disaster but made
no better by our intervention, the
Saudis’ intervention, and the Qataris’
intervention.
There is a great deal of unknowns as
to whether the Sunni extremists who
were supported by the Saudis, Qataris,
and sometimes us would actually be
more humanitarian or more for human
rights than Assad is.
I think we can agree that Assad has
abused his people, has used chemical
weapons, et cetera, et cetera, but on
the other side were Sunni extremists
allied with the ideas of radical Islam,
with radical jihad, with the things that
led to 9/11.
So it is a very complicated situation
over there, but I think we cannot say
with certainty that there will not be a
deal that sticks, actually, between
Assad and the Kurds.
If the Kurds want a homeland and
they believe Assad is staying, it makes
all the sense in the world for them to
work together. If Assad wants to actu-
ally protect that region of north Syria,
either from Turkey or from others, and
the Kurds are willing to help him do it,

the Kurds have proven they are good
fighters.
The Kurds would probably have to
acknowledge there is a greater Syria
and that they are part of it. If they
want to break off from Syria, there
will be continual war. If they are able
to make an arrangement with Assad,
there is a chance that there could be an
oil-sharing arrangement like we have
in Iraq.
The bottom line is, we sometimes see
the world in black-and-white terms and
think we can get Thomas Jefferson in
Syria or in Libya or in Iraq, but what
happens is, time and time again, we
topple a dictator, we get chaos, we get
more terrorism. ISIS sprang out of the
vacuum that was Iraq after a govern-
ment that was incapable of doing it
after we get rid of the same. The same
thing happened when we got rid of Qa-
dhafi in Libya. I think we need to
rethink our approach to the Middle
East.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia.
Mr. WARNER. I will not belabor the
point. I know my friend from Con-
necticut is here to raise another issue.
I don’t agree with the analysis of the
Senator from Kentucky. I hope he
proves to be right. I would agree with
him; sometimes our notion that we are
going to find Thomas Jefferson to re-
build these countries has not proven to
be the case.
This legislation I am proposing is not
broad policy changing; it is simply say-
ing let’s look at a very limited uni-
verse of individuals who 2 weeks ago
were working with the American mili-
tary.
My fear is, at least in terms of how
those translators and their families
will be viewed by both the Turks and
by the Assad forces, that they will not
be viewed as Thomas Jeffersons, but
they will be viewed as Benedict
Arnolds, and my fear is their fate will
be on our hands.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1247
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I
want to thank my colleague from Vir-
ginia for his advocacy on this critical
measure, and I support him on it and
also for his advocacy on the FIRE Act.
It is very similar to the measure on
which I am going to ask for unanimous
consent. He has done wonderful and
dedicated work on both measures.
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the
Rules Committee be discharged from
further consideration of S. 1247; that
the Senate proceed to its immediate
consideration; that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed; and
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table,
with no intervening action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Kentucky.
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, reserving
the right to object, I am concerned
that this bill would put an undue bur-
den on anybody who decided to run for
office in the sense that you would be
burdened with trying to understand ev-
eryone you talk to anywhere in the
United States—whether or not they are
an agent of a foreign government or an
agent of a foreign principle, such as a
foreign company.
For example, I might run into Hunter
Biden in the airport. I know he is an
American citizen, but this bill doesn’t
prevent American citizens from being
an agent of a foreign principle. Hunter
Biden also worked for a Ukrainian oli-
garch and a company with mysterious
origins that may well have something
to do with our foreign policy.
So if I meet Hunter Biden, I am con-
cerned that now it may be against the
law or I could be reprimanded or fined
by the FEC for talking to Hunter
Biden.
The same might also exist—I enjoy
going to the Indian New Year in Louis-
ville, and I sometimes see 5,000 to 6,000
Indian Americans, but I can’t tell you
how many of them are brand new to
the country, what their visa status is,
whether they have a relative from gov-
ernment there who might come up to
me.
So I think we need to be very careful
about putting forward law, particularly
by unanimous consent, that hasn’t
been scrutinized and might end up hav-
ing a burden that we don’t really agree
with.
There has been a certain degree of
hysteria over the Russian thing. Some
on the other side of the aisle can’t get
over they lost the Presidential elec-
tion, and so they continue to blame the
Russians for losing the election.
It is so bad that their candidate from
the last election, Hillary Clinton, had
to go after TULSI GABBARD, a Demo-
cratic Member of the Congress, a sit-
ting Congresswoman, the first female
combat veteran to run for President,
and she has been labeled by Hillary
Clinton a Russian asset.
So you can see that the hysteria over
Russia is a little bit concerning; that
we may be going too far in this
hysteria.
Then, once we apply this to the
world, is there going to be a hesitancy
to talk to someone who looks different
than you, who dresses different than
you, who has a different color skin
than yours because you are concerned
they might be from a foreign country?
So I think this would have the abil-
ity of stifling speech—stifling political
speech—and I think it is a reactionary
way to look at things, and it really fits
in with this unseemliness of Hillary
Clinton’s thinking everybody is a Rus-
sian agent to many of the Democrats
saying: Donald Trump is a Russian
agent.
We spent $35 million on this notion.
This was probably a notion promul-
gated by people within the intelligence
community who already hated Donald
Trump before he was elected. I hope we
get to the bottom of this, but I am not
about to allow, by unanimous consent,
an attempt to politicize our election
process and make it so absurd that you
would have to worry about whom you
talk to as you travel the country.
I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard.
The Senator from Connecticut.
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I
truly regret the objection by my col-
league. I regret even more the reasons
for his objection, characterizing the
threat of Russia interference as
hysteria.
Well, I suggest that my friend from
Kentucky spend a little bit of time—it
will not take a lot—with members of
the intelligence community, any mem-
ber of the intelligence community, all
the members of the intelligence com-
munity, who agree unanimously that
the threat of Russian interference is
real. In fact, it is ongoing.
That is the warning we have received
from the CIA, the Director of National
Intelligence, and, most pointedly, from
the Director of the FBI. They have
warned us, in no uncertain terms, that
the Russians are interfering now,
spreading disinformation, creating
false accounts and sites and that they
are planning to do it even more in-
tensely. It is not only the Russians but
other nations.
That was the warning of Robert
Mueller when he said that the Rus-
sians’ interference in our last election
was sweeping and systematic and that
they were doing it again and we need
to pay attention to it.
That is exactly what my colleagues
and I have been doing for the past few
days, raising for floor consideration
various election securities bills. We
have done it not only in the last few
days but for months—the PAVE Act,
the Honest Ads Act, the SHIELD Act,
but my colleague from Kentucky says
it is hysteria.
Well, it is a well-founded fear based
on fact. As one of our former col-
leagues, Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
once said: People are entitled to their
own opinions; they are not entitled to
their own facts. The facts here are in-
disputable, set forth in numbing detail
by the Mueller report but also by the
intelligence community, independ-
ently, in the hearings that have been
conducted by various of our commit-
tees, in open and public, in Armed
Services and Judiciary, and also behind
closed doors. Some of them the intel-
ligence community—which produced a
report, most recently by the Senate In-
telligence Committee, a bipartisan re-
port, showing how the Russians scan
every single State to penetrate them,
seeking to disrupt them, and that is an
absolutely chilling fact-based, evi-
dence-founded prospect that we need to
counter, and that is the reason my col-
leagues and I have come to the floor for
these measures. A number of them I
have been proud to cosponsor and
helped to lead.
The one that brings me here now is
the Duty to Report Act, S. 1247, and it

S6142 October 24, 2019
very simply says there is a duty to re-
port. If there is an illegal offer of as-
sistance, if anyone knows of an illegal
acceptance of assistance from a foreign
leader or foreign national or foreign
government, there is a duty to tell the
FBI or some other law enforcement of-
ficial.
The plain fact is our elections are
under attack, and 2016 was only a dress
rehearsal.
Just this week, talk about hysteria,
Facebook banned dozens of fake Rus-
sian and Iranian accounts attempting
to spread misinformation and
disinformation to Americans—the pur-
pose: to disrupt the 2020 election.
It isn’t necessarily an ad for one can-
didate or another. It may be an ad that
seeks to suppress the vote. The point
is, that attack will continue, and oppo-
sition to it is based on hysteria about
the potential political implications.
What saddens and angers me is that
our Commander in Chief—not just
some of our colleagues—refuses to be-
lieve that our elections were attacked
and will be again. He is actively work-
ing to undermine our democracy.
The President’s attempts to invite a
foreign leader, the Ukrainian Presi-
dent, to interfere in our democratic
elections was a betrayal of his oath of
office and an abuse of power. It is an
impeachable offense. But it will occur
again by others, as well as him, if we
do not pass measures like the Duty to
Report Act.
It started with a whistleblower com-
plaint, but now we have call notes be-
tween the President and Ukraine Presi-
dent Zelensky, the corroborating state-
ments of multiple witnesses in the gov-
ernment, and President Trump’s own
statements—his own words—on live
television, admitting that he did this.
The transcript of his call chillingly
shows how he literally pressured and
extorted the Ukrainian President,
using the threat of a cut or elimination
of military aid vital to Ukrainian lives
and Ukrainian defense against an ongo-
ing Russian attack, not to mention the
visit to the White House, also used as
leverage with these 10 powerful words:
‘‘I would like you to do us a favor
though.’’ The favor was digging dirt on
a political opponent through a full in-
vestigation to favor himself over that
opponent.
The invitation to interfere in our
elections goes to the core of our demo-
cratic institutions. It is literally
condoning and, in fact, inviting and en-
couraging an attack on our democratic
institution, and the President has said,
when he was asked, that if he were of-
fered foreign assistance, he would take
it. His son, during the last campaign,
was offered Russian assistance, and his
response was: ‘‘I love it.’’
That is not the appropriate response
for the offer of an illegal act of assist-
ance. It should be to go to the FBI or
another law enforcement agency.
Every Republican should be asked to
answer the question—in fact, forced to
answer this question: Is it acceptable
to solicit or accept the assistance of a
foreign power to win an election?
We cannot allow this kind of practice
to become the new normal. It is al-
ready illegal to accept or solicit such
an assistance from a foreign govern-
ment or leader, and what we want to do
is make it illegal to fail to report it.
Finally, as for my colleagues’ objec-
tion that it would inhibit somehow an
active and honest campaign, someone
who has reason to know that there is
an illegal offer of assistance and some-
one who knows that that assistance is
being solicited by his or her campaign
or a member of their family, certainly,
should feel a duty to report as a matter
of simple patriotism and moral obliga-
tion, not to mention legal responsi-
bility.
With the 2020 Presidential election
looming, we must stop this kind of for-
eign interference. We must take active
and effective measures against it. We
must ensure that the American peo-
ple—not Russia or China or Iran, and
they are all gunning for our democratic
institution—decide who the leaders of
this country will be and what direction
our democracy will take.

am on the Senate floor now, where in a
moment I will be asking for unanimous
consent for the Senate to take up and
vote on a House-passed bill that would
provide full mandatory funding for his-
torically Black colleges and univer-
sities and other minority-serving insti-
tutions.
The reason I am here is that the au-

expired 24 days ago, and we have it
within our power right now to remedy
that situation. We can take up a vote
on what is called the FUTURE Act. We

October 24, 2019
championed by Senators JONES and
SCOTT, and we have before us at the
desk a bill passed by the House of Rep-
resentatives by voice vote, which
passed unanimously by the House of
Representatives.
Without the passage of this bill, the
FUTURE Act, our Nation’s historically
Black colleges and universities will
lose $85 million a year in critical fund-
ing aimed at bolstering their resources,
improving their management, and en-
hancing their academic programs.
In my home State of Maryland, we
have four terrific HBCUs—Bowie State,
Coppin, Morgan State, and University
of Maryland Eastern Shore. Collec-
tively, they stand to lose over $4 mil-
lion a year, which they need for things
like classroom upgrades, experiential
learning opportunities, and services for
supporting students and helping them
stay in school.
I realize there are some who say that
since we just enacted fiscal year 2019
funding, there is no urgency to take up
and pass this bill now. But just this
past Saturday, I met with board mem-
bers of the Thurgood Marshall College
Fund. That is the organization that
represents our Nation’s public HBCUs.
When they asked me why, when there
is so much agreement and support for
this program, we couldn’t pass the ex-
tension, I couldn’t give them a good
answer.
They gave me a letter they had sent
to the U.S. Senate just last week, try-
ing to dispel the myth that there is no
urgency to the current situation. Their
president, Dr. Harry Williams, wrote:
The expiration of this program is already
having real consequences. . . . We already
have examples of campuses notifying em-
ployees that their positions and programs
will be terminated as of September 30, 2020,
if not sooner. These are real jobs, held by
people who interact with students everyday,
in programs that play a critical role in grad-
uating and retaining students in the STEM
fields, among other disciplines.
He goes on to write:
The longer we wait to give certainty to
these universities, the more institutions will
be left with no choice but to begin winding-
down programs that materially benefit stu-
dents and employees alike, and strip away
the institutional knowledge bases that our
schools have built over time.
That is from Dr. Harry Williams, the
president of the Thurgood Marshall
College Fund.
I heard the same thing from our
Maryland HBCUs, that they have to
plan now for what is going to happen
next year. They can’t budget and they
can’t plan on hope; they have to budget
and plan on reality.
So I understand—our colleague, the
Senator from Tennessee and the chair-
man of the HELP Committee, is on the
floor, and, like him, I hope we do a
broader higher ed reauthorization. I
think we need to do that. I know the
House wants to do that. I spoke earlier
today with the House Education and
Labor Committee Chairman, BOBBY
SCOTT. He wants to do something too.
He has introduced it. But he and the
House also understand that time is of
essence when it comes to this piece
dealing with minority-serving institu-
tions, which is why the House sent it
over to us in the first place. So there is
really no time to waste. We need to
give these universities and colleges
certainty.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of Calendar No.
212, H.R. 2486; that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed; and
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table
with no intervening action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Tennessee.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, with all re-
spect, this is no way to help histori-
cally Black colleges and minority-serv-
ing institutions. What the Senator
from Maryland is suggesting is that we
pass a bill that would have 2 years’
funding that is supported by a budget
gimmick that will never pass the U.S.
Senate. If we are relying on that pro-
posal to fund historically Black col-
leges, it is all over.
What I have offered instead—and I in-
troduced 3 weeks ago on the floor of
the Senate—is a bipartisan package of
bills that begins with permanent fund-
ing for historically Black colleges and
minority-serving institutions that is
fully paid for.
So if the choice is between 2 years of
a gimmick that will never pass the
Senate and permanent funding that is
fully paid for, that is not much of a
hard decision for me.
In addition to that, I suggested at
the same time that we pass some other
proposals that are bipartisan and have
been drafted by 32 Senators—18 Demo-
crats, 14 Republicans. In addition to
the long-term, permanent solution for
minority-serving institutions of $225
million a year, we include simplifying
FAFSA, which would help 20 million
families a year. Senator JONES and I
introduced a bill to do that just yester-
day. That can pass this week and go to
the President and be signed into law.
There is also Pell grants for prisoners,
short-term Pell grants. Senator DAINES
and Senator PORTMAN and many others
have suggested that. We have a pro-
posal that simplifies the aid letters. We
have a way to pay for the package. We
have a way to keep parents from hav-
ing to send two sets of tax information
to two different agencies of govern-
ment—all in this package.
The eight bills—and three bills I hope
to include later—ended up being co-
sponsored by 48 Senators, 25 Democrats
and 23 Republicans. All of this is ready
to be considered by the Senate and sent
to the President and can pass this year.
So I am about to object, but what I
want to make clear to the historically
Black colleges—and there are six of
them in Tennessee—is that the Sec-
retary of Education has written a let-
ter assuring them that there are suffi-
cient funds for another year and that
the proposal by the Senator from
Maryland would only be 2 years, is a
budget gimmick, and will never pass
the Senate.
So let’s work together to perma-
nently fund historically Black colleges,
simplify the FAFSA, 2-year Pell
grants, increase the number of stu-
dents who get Pell grants—all of that
can be done now. Let’s not keep pre-
tending that we are helping the col-
leges with a proposal that is short-
term, a budget gimmick, and will never
pass the Senate.
I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Maryland.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I
would just say to the chairman of the
HELP Committee that I believe the
best judge of what is good for HBCUs is
HBCUs themselves. They have asked
the Senate to act immediately on the
legislation that passed the House
unanimously on a voice vote. So while
we all would like to work toward com-
prehensive reform and reauthorization
of higher education, there is no need to
wait on this provision that is sitting in
the Senate.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD the
letters we received from the Thurgood
Marshall College Fund and from the
UNCF, both organizations that advo-
cate on behalf of HBCUs.

rial was ordered to be printed in the

appointed that the Senate did not pass the
FUTURE Act prior to the September 30th
deadline to prevent the Title Ill Part-F pro-
gram from expiring.
While it is true that Historically Black
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are fund-
ed through the academic school year ending
in April 2020, the expiration of this program
as set forth in the plain language of 20 U.S.C.
§ 1067q, means that no more grants will be
made available to HBCUs going forward and,
as such, our institutions will be without the
ability to preserve the status quo as it re-
lates to the student programs and jobs sup-
ported by this funding.
In fact, the expiration of this program is
already having real consequences on the
campuses of the publicly-supported HBCUs
that we represent. Despite having expired
only two weeks ago, we already have exam-
ples of campuses notifying employees that
their positions and programs will be termi-
nated as of September 30, 2020, if not sooner.
These are real jobs, held by people who inter-
act with students everyday, in programs
that play a critical role in graduating and
retaining students in the STEM fields,

among other disciplines. The longer we wait
to give certainty to these universities, the
more institutions will be left with no choice
but to begin winding-down programs that
materially benefit students and employees
alike, and strip away the institutional
knowledge bases that our schools have built
over time with the support of Title III, Part
F.
While we welcome a potential long-term or
‘‘permanent’’ solution to Title III, Part F,
what we are hearing from our campuses is
clear—they simply do not have the time to
wait for Congress to work out a deal, par-
ticularly on bills that have an uncertain fu-
ture in both houses of Congress. Therefore,
the Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF)
strongly encourages the Senate to finally
take-up the House-passed, bi-partisan and bi-
cameral FUTURE Act immediately and pass
the bill before permanent damage is done to
our campuses. This course of action is the
cleanest and most expedient way to provide
immediate certainty to our nation’s HBCUs
and MSIs.
Following the Senate’s passage of FU-
TURE Act, TMCF looks forward to working
with leaders on both sides of the aisle to de-
velop a longer-term solution for Title Ill,
Part F, and for other HEA-related issues in a
broader bill like the Student Aid Improve-
ment Act or a comprehensive HEA reauthor-
ization that includes the permanent exten-
sion of Title III, Part F funds.

DEAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL, MI-
NORITY LEADER SCHUMER, CHAIRMAN ALEX-
ANDER, AND RANKING MEMBER MURRAY: UNCF
(the United Negro College Fund, Inc.) sub-
mits this letter urging you to cosponsor,
support, and pass the House-passed H.R. 2486,
the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by
Unlocking Resources for Education (FU-
TURE) Act. This bipartisan, bicameral bill
passed the House Floor on September 17th by
voice vote and has now been sent to the Sen-
ate for consideration.
UNCF is a non-profit organization with a
mission to build a robust and nationally-rec-
ognized pipeline of underrepresented stu-
dents who, because of UNCF support, become
highly-qualified college graduates and to en-
sure that our network of 37-member, private
Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs) is a respected model of best practice
in moving students to and through college.
The 101 HBCUs that exist today are valu-
able institutions with a large economic foot-
print. Despite only representing 3 percent of
all two-and four-year non-profit colleges and
universities, HBCUs (1) enroll 10 percent of
all African American undergraduates; (2)
produce 17 percent of all African American
college graduates with bachelor’s degrees;
and (3) graduate 21 percent of all African
Americans with bachelor’s degrees in STEM
fields. Moreover, these institutions have a
strong economic impact, especially on the
regions in which they are located, by cre-
ating 134,090 jobs, producing $10.1 billion in
terms of gross regional product, and having
a total annual economic impact of $14.8 bil-
lion.
Despite the large economic impact of these
institutions, they continue to be under-
resourced and have endowments that lag be-
hind those of non-HBCUs by at least 70 per-
cent. Unfortunately, this is common for
HBCUs and Congress has recognized this and
sought out ways to find parity between
HBCUs and non-HBCUs. One strategic way in
attempting to help HBCUs receive adequate
resources was initially through the College
Cost and Reduction Act of 2007. This bill al-
lowed for HBCUs, Tribal Colleges and Uni-
versities (TCUs), Hispanic-Serving Institu-
tions (HSIs), and other Minority-Serving In-
stitutions (MSIs) to receive $255 million an-
nually in mandatory funds for Fiscal Year
(FY) 2008 and FY 2009. These mandatory
funds were directed in the Higher Education
Act of 1965 to be used solely for science, tech-
nology, education, and mathematics (STEM)
education, among other uses largely cen-
tered around STEM. Instead of allowing this
funding stream to expire, Congress continued
to recognize the need of these institutions to
offer quality STEM programs on their cam-
puses and continued this funding stream in
the Student Aid Fiscal Responsibility Act
(SAFRA) of 2009. SAFRA extended funding
for these institutions from FY 2009 to FY
2019 at $255 million annually and was in-
cluded in the Health Care Reconciliation Act
of 2010 that ultimately passed both the
House and Senate to became law. Every vote
taken on the mandatory funding stream for
these institutions has been bipartisan, and it
is our desire to have the same outcome for
H.R. 2486.
It is imperative that the Senate pass the
FUTURE Act because funding for HBCUs,
TCUs, HSIs, and other MSIs expires Sep-
tember 30, 2019. While we support a perma-
nent extension of mandatory funding, H.R.
2486, due to its passage in the House of Rep-
resentatives, is the surest way for these in-
stitutions to maintain funding for FY 2020
and FY 2021. We strongly believe that pass-
ing this bill now will address the immediate
funding needs of our institutions and allow
Congress to continue to work towards a per-
manent extension of this funding moving for-
ward.
Should you have any additional questions
regarding this letter, please feel free to
reach out to Emmanual Guillory, Director of
Public Policy and Government Affairs.
Sincerely,
MICHAEL L. LOMAX, PH.D.,
President and CEO.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I just underscore
the fact, with respect to the chairman,
that the best judge of what is good for
HBCUs, I think, is HBCUs. They are
worried because they are already hav-
ing to provide notice to their profes-
sors and their staff that funding might
not be available next year. I know, in
the Senate, sometimes we think that
no one needs to plan ahead, but most of
the world needs to plan ahead.
We will be back on this floor in the
future again, asking that we pass this
urgent matter.
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING CHARLES T. JONES
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I am
here to recognize an unbelievable indi-
vidual who contributed so much to my
home State and to our country.
My home State of West Virginia has
lost a beloved family man, a noble vet-
eran, a legendary businessman, a very
proud West Virginian, and a very dear
friend.
President John Kennedy, when vis-
iting our State during our centennial
in 1963, said: ‘‘The sun does not always
shine in West Virginia, but the people
always do.’’
Charles T. Jones, whom we called
‘‘Captain Charlie,’’ exemplified this,
and his light will forever shine through
the many people who knew and loved
him best. He was truly one of a kind.
He was one of the most warm, kind
people I ever had the privilege of know-
ing.
Last year, I had the privilege of sub-
mitting a CONGRESSIONAL RECORD
statement for Charlie’s 100th birthday.
He credited his longevity to good
genes, good luck, a great wife, and very
supportive family, colleagues, and
friends.
Charlie was an innovator. He always
had ideas for how to make something
better or run more smoothly, making
him a joy to work with and to work
for.
There is no greater reward in life
than to be in a position to give back to
the place that made you who you are.
While he grew up on the banks of the
Kanawha River in West Virginia, Char-
lie attended school in New Jersey, later
earning a degree in business from Bab-
son Institute in Massachusetts.
Charlie then served his country in
the U.S. Navy during World War II
with the Navy Seabees in Guadalcanal
and on a minesweeper as an engineer-
ing officer off the coast of Japan and
the Philippines.
After the war’s end, Charlie came
home to West Virginia and went to
work for his family’s coking coal busi-
ness—Star Coal and Coke Company—
which later became Amherst Coal Com-
pany in 1946. That was the company his
grandfather started in 1893.
Due to the downturn in production of
and demand for coking coal, out of ne-
cessity, the company ventured into
river transportation. In 1951, the fam-
ily bought the Hatfield-Campbell Creek
Coal Company, a business that oper-
ated steamboats, barges, and river ter-
minals along the Kanawha and Ohio
Rivers. He took over the river oper-
ations of the company and renamed
them Amherst Barge Company. Along
the way, the company became Madison
Coal & Supply Company and is now
known as Amherst Madison and still
specializes in marine services like tow-
ing, construction, shipping, and equip-
ment repairs. Amherst and its affili-
ated companies have proudly employed
thousands of Virginians over the past
70 years.
Charlie was one of the most hard-
working, humble, and giving people the
Mountain State has ever known and
was a longtime supporter of many busi-
ness, charitable, and community orga-
nizations throughout the Kanawha

Valley. Over the years, he served on
numerous boards and committees, in-
cluding the Yeager Airport Authority
Board, Board of Trustees for the Uni-
versity of Charleston, Chairman Emer-
itus of the Inland Waterways Users
Board, Trustee Emeritus of the West
Virginia Chapter of the Nature Conser-
vancy, Director Emeritus of the Mari-
ners’ Museum, past Chairman of the
West Virginia Mining and Reclamation
Association, former Director of the
Charleston Area Medical Center Foun-
dation, One Valley Bancorp, the West-
ern Pocahontas Corporation, Ohio Val-
ley Improvement Association, and so
many more.
In recent years, Charlie was honored
as a Distinguished West Virginian by
the Governor, entered into the Honor-
able Order of Kentucky Colonels by the
people of the Commonwealth of Ken-
tucky, inducted into the West Virginia
University College of Business and Eco-
nomics Business Hall of Fame, and rec-
ognized as a West Virginia ‘‘Who’s
Who’’ by the State Journal.
Additionally, he received previous
honors, such as the Charleston YMCA’s
Spirit of the Valley Award, induction
into the Coal Mining Hall of Fame,
Charleston Gazette-Mail’s West Vir-
ginian of the Year, Seamen’s Church
Institute Lifetime Achievement
Award, and the National Rivers Hall of
Fame Achievement Award, to name
only a few.
Put simply, Charlie was a regular
Renaissance man. What stands out
about Charlie’s character was he that
he was beloved by those who worked
with him and knew him. He was com-
passionate and considerate and was
also a strong leader and motivator
with an unparalleled work ethic. It was
an honor to call him a friend.
Once again, Gayle and I send our
deepest condolences to his children,
Laura Jones Pray, C. Tandy Jones, and
Jennifer Jones. I am honored to join
each of you in remembering Charlie’s
legacy, as well as the unwavering love
he had for his loved ones, community,
and, most importantly, our home
State.
I know he and Mary Ellen and their
son Nelson are looking down on each of
them fondly today.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida.

VENEZUELA
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President,
I rise today to speak about the crisis in
Venezuela, a defining human rights
issue of our time. Nicolas Maduro is
starving his own people, and innocent
children are dying. What is happening
in Venezuela is pure genocide. With
every day that passes, the situation in
Venezuela grows more dire.
I will not stand by and let Maduro
continue terrorizing his people. I will
not let Democrats in Congress use the
Venezuelan people as a political prop. I
will not allow the inaction to continue.
Americans have always stood up for
freedom, and today is no exception.
That is why I am here again to ask
unanimous consent to pass my amend-
ment to H.R. 549, granting temporary
protective status for Venezuelans flee-
ing Nicolas Maduro’s oppressive re-
gime. Even though Senate Democrats
blocked the same proposal last month,
I refuse to give up. I stand with the
proud Venezuelans.
My proposal has the support of all
Senate Republicans. I believe that the
President will sign this into law. It is
the only solution that stands a chance
of becoming law. We have to act.
We also need to be responsible. The
courts have, basically, made a tem-
porary program permanent, which is
not sustainable. Despite what some
confused Democrats, including Speaker
PELOSI may say, the ‘‘T’’ in TPS actu-
ally does mean ‘‘temporary.’’
In addition to protecting Venezuelan
people right now, my amendment
makes much needed reforms to our
TPS program and returns the program
to its intended purpose. We want those
seeking refuge from war and oppressive
regimes to have a safe haven in our
country, but we need a system that
works and is truly temporary. We need
to act now to save the Venezuelan peo-
ple.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to address the Senate in Spanish.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. (English
translation of the statement made in
Spanish is as follows:)
We need TPS now.
I stand with the people of Venezuela,
and I will continue to fight for freedom
and democracy in Latin America.
It is time for Maduro and his thugs to
leave power.
f
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—
H.R. 549
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President,
I ask unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged
from further consideration and that
the Senate proceed to the immediate
consideration of H.R. 549. I ask unani-
mous consent that my amendment at
the desk be agreed to, that the bill, as
amended, be considered read a third
time and passed, and that the motion
to reconsider be considered made and
laid upon the table.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRAMER). Is there objection?
The Senator from Maryland.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, in
reserving the right to object, I share
the concerns expressed by my col-
league, the Senator from Florida,
about the situation in Venezuela.
I have met with many of my con-
stituents of Venezuelan heritage and
have discussed with them the crises
that their relatives back in Venezuela
face every day—shortages of food,
water, medicine, and state-sponsored
violence, which has caused 4.3 million
people to flee the country.
That is exactly why I joined many of
my colleagues in supporting legislation
from many months ago of granting
temporary protected status to people
who flee the horror in Venezuela. Of
course, the House of Representatives
passed legislation to do exactly that. I
have a copy of H.R. 549 in my hand, and
it is sitting here in the U.S. Senate.
I say to my colleague, the Senator
from Florida, that I am happy to sit
down with him and discuss how we can
revise and reform the entire TPS sys-
tem in our going forward. In fact, I in-
troduced legislation back in March of
this year, S. 879, to extend temporary
protected status to all of the people
who are, right now, in great fear of
being deported from the United States
when their protected statuses expire.
Yet I recognize there may be reforms
we can make to the overall system.
I suggest that a bill that is just fo-
cused on TPS to Venezuela is not the
place to try to reform the entire TPS
system, about which I am more than
happy to have a discussion. As the Sen-
ator knows, we have people with TPS
status from many countries, including
El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,
Haiti, and a number of African coun-
tries. To try to overhaul the entire sys-
tem in one piece of legislation by pass-
ing something right now for Venezuela
doesn’t make a lot of sense, which is
why I support what the House did, for
it immediately addresses the situation
in Venezuela with our current TPS sys-
tem.
Let’s not try to rewrite the whole
TPS set of rules now. Let’s address the
emergency situation right now. The
Senate can do that by passing the
House bill, which, in a moment, I will
ask to take up.
I object to the Senator’s request to
pass this version, which also tries to
overhaul the entire TPS system.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Maryland.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged
from further consideration and that
the Senate proceed to the immediate
consideration of H.R. 549. I ask unani-
mous consent that my amendment at
the desk be agreed to, that the bill, as
amended, be considered read a third

my unanimous consent request.

and that the Senate proceed to its im-
mediate consideration; further, that
the bill be considered read a third time
and passed and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Florida.
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President,
in reserving the right to object, I ap-
preciate the opportunity to work with
my colleague from Maryland, and I
look forward to working with him
again in the future. It would be great if
we could work together to try to figure
out how to provide temporary pro-
tected status for Venezuelans and also
to fix the program so it continues to
work not just for Venezuelans but for
people all over the world.
The Democrats know their proposal
cannot become law. It lacks support in
the Senate, which is why I proposed an
amendment that has support and that
can actually become law immediately.
My amendment grants TPS to Ven-
ezuelans for 18 months. It requires con-
gressional approval for TPS extensions
of no more than 18 months at a time.
My amendment limits the ability of il-
legal aliens who have no connection to
the TPS designation to benefit from
TPS. It ensures that human rights vio-
lators who are identified under the
Magnitsky Act are not eligible for TPS
status. It includes provisions to distin-
guish that TPS status does not count
as an admission for purposes of the Im-
migration and Nationality Act. Under
my amendment, TPS recipients cannot
return to the TPS country during the
period of designation. Finally, the
amendment requires that current TPS
designations come up for congressional
review 2 years after the enactment of
this amendment.
My amendment is the only way to
help the Venezuelan people. It is the
only proposal that can become law.
There is no path forward for the Demo-
crats’ plan, and, unfortunately, they
know it.
It is clear, now more than ever, that,
unfortunately, the Democrats don’t
want to get anything done on this
issue. That is why they are standing in
our way. All Republican Senators have
signed off on this. Unfortunately, the
Democrats have decided to use the
Venezuelan community as a political
prop instead of working with us to find
a solution.
We cannot lose sight of the fact that
Nicolas Maduro is killing his citizens.
It is a genocide. Who will we be if we
turn our backs on a genocide right here
in our hemisphere? We cannot. We
must help Venezuelan families.
It is also time to reform TPS in this
country. Temporary protected status
was never meant to be endless. It was
meant to help families in need. So let’s
get the program to work.
I look forward to working with my
colleague from Maryland and with all
of my colleagues to help the families in
Venezuela and to finally create a long-
term solution to TPS. I will not rest
until we do.
My colleague Senator RAND PAUL
asked that I object to the Senate
Democrats’ proposal. On behalf of Sen-
ator PAUL, I object.

TURKEY AND SYRIA
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want
to take the next 15 or 20 minutes today
to talk about the ongoing situation in
Syria and the region surrounding that
country.
It is a part of the world that some
folks might not be all that familiar
with, so let’s take a look at the area
that I will be discussing today: Syria,
the Mediterranean, with Greece up
here.
Just north of Syria, we have Turkey.
To the southeast of Syria, we have
Iraq. Further to the east of Iraq, we
have Iran. To the south-southwest of
Syria, we have Lebanon, Israel, and
Jordan. South of Jordan is Saudi Ara-
bia. Over here we have Egypt, the Red
Sea, and Georgia—not the State, the
country. That gives us just a little bit
of the lay of the land. The focus of my
remarks today will be on Syria.
Three years and 4 months ago this
week, I stood here on the Senate floor
in front of a map of Syria and spoke of
the progress that was about to be made
in that country in the battle to de-
grade and destroy ISIS.
We are going to look at another map.
It is pretty much the same area, blown
up—Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Lebanon, Jor-
dan, and Israel. The area here in what
I call a peach color is where ISIS was
running the show or had undue influ-
ence.
At this particular point in time, ISIS
had been making undeniable progress
in building what they called their ca-
liphate, their country, their capital.
Again, this is the area they covered at
the height of their influence.
ISIS at that time had recruited more
manpower than any terrorist group in
the world and was also the richest ter-
rorist group in the world. They would
literally go into an area of the town or
country and loot the banks, empty the
vaults, take the cash, take the money,
and run.
Through their dominant social media
presence, ISIS was attracting some
2,000 foreign fighters per month. That
included 10 Americans per month,
which would mean over 100 Americans
per year on an annual basis. ISIS con-
trolled most of northern Syria, includ-
ing Raqqa, which it claimed as its cap-
ital, and the strategic city of Manbij,
which is close by.
ISIS was able to project an image of
strength to the world, reeling in poten-
tial recruits by touting their victories
in the region. You know how everybody
wants to be the winner in football, and
you see a lot of people wearing Boston
Patriots clothing. We will probably see
a lot more Nats fans in the months to
come and Houston Astros fans as well.
But ISIS was projecting an image of
strength to the world, and they were
reeling in potential recruits by touting
their victories in the region and their
growing territory.
Three years and four months ago,
when I stood here on the Senate floor,
progress was actually being made in re-
versing ISIS’s growth. U.S. and Kurd-
ish forces had recaptured Manbij, send-
ing ISIS recruitment tumbling, from
about 2,000 fighters a month down to
200. I will say that again. They were re-
cruiting 2,000 a month, and they were
down to about 200.
We had found where they kept a lot
of their money, not all of it, but we de-
stroyed about one-third of it. ISIS had
previously held the strategically im-
portant Sunni Triangle in nearby Iraq.
But when I spoke on the floor, right
here, 3 years ago, in 2016, Iraqi forces
recaptured the cities of Tikrit,
Fallujah, and Ramadi, and we were
poised to make additional gains in the
months that followed in the battle
against ISIS.
Just over a year later, in 2017, Raqqa
was recaptured from ISIS control.
Around that time, and in the months
that followed, ISIS’s sphere of influ-
ence undoubtedly diminished by about
two-thirds.
I referred to that map already, but
we will look at it again. This is where

they were about 3 years and 4 months
ago. That is basically where they were.
In short order, from there, they lost
about two-thirds of the land they were
controlling and are down to this point
right here.
When I speak of the progress we
made, I am not just referring to U.S.
forces or the United States alone or
one or two of our allies. I am speaking
of a coalition—get this—of over 60 na-
tions that would come together to
fight the rise of ISIS and prevent it
from establishing the caliphate that I
referred to earlier.
Each member of the coalition found
that it was in their own naked self-in-
terest to join this fight as part of a big-
ger coalition. Among the forces that
contributed the most, though, were—
believe it or not—the Syrian Kurds.
If you asked most people, who are the
Kurds, where are they from, tell us
something about the Kurds, they would
have no idea. It turns out, the Kurds
are one of the largest ethnic groups in
the world without a nation of their own
to call their own home. There are 30
million of them. They are largely di-
vided across four countries: Syria, Tur-
key, Iran, and Iraq.
For decades, the Kurds have sought
self-determination and basic rights,
something we all want for ourselves
and our families. But too often, in-
stead, they have been victimized, at-
tacked, and slaughtered, including by
President Erdogan of Turkey.
Over the last several years, though,
Kurdish soldiers trained and fought
against ISIS alongside of our soldiers
as part of the Syrian Democratic
Forces. They call themselves the SDF,
or the Syrian Democratic Forces. The
Kurdish soldiers put their lives at risk
to stop ISIS from successfully estab-
lishing a caliphate from which to
wreak even more havoc around the
globe and even here in the United
States.
In fact, the Kurdish SDF fighters
were the ones carrying out most of the
ground operations, while U.S. troops
provided support. Their willingness—
the willingness of the Kurdish fight-
ers—to risk their lives and shed their
blood likely meant that countless
American lives were spared.
I am going to say that again. The
willingness of Kurdish fighters to risk
their lives and shed their blood likely
meant that countless American lives
were spared.
Some 11,000 Kurdish fighters have
been killed in combat while fighting
ISIS. Compare that to the four Amer-
ican lives we have lost during the same
campaign. Think about that. Eleven
thousand Kurdish fighters laid down
their lives. Four Americans lost their
lives. That is too many, but what an
imbalance. We have heard it said often-
times: They laid down their lives to
spare ours. And that is exactly what
happened.
Earlier this month, President Trump
abruptly announced that he would be
pulling the remaining coalition forces
from Syria, effective immediately. He
did not do so after thoughtful consider-
ation of the risks involved to U.S. in-
terests. He did not consult with our al-
lies. As far as I know, he did not con-
sult with our military leadership—cer-
tainly not some of the ones retired now
who are speaking up, raising their
voices. Rather, he did so after a week-
end phone call with Turkish President
Erdogan.
In the process, he left our Kurdish al-
lies hanging out to dry.
As someone who has actually served
this Nation in uniform at a time of
war, I have served with coalitions be-
fore. Two of the most important fac-
tors in building a successful coalition
are communication and trust.
Our abrupt abandonment of Kurdish
forces and their people will not serve to
encourage other countries around the
world to risk the lives of their soldiers
and join a coalition led by us, the
Americans. In fact, what we have done
in abandoning the Kurds is going to
discourage other nations from deciding
to join a coalition with us in the fu-
ture—certainly in the near future and
maybe longer than that.
The decision to abandon our Kurdish
allies isn’t just morally wrong—and it
is. It is not just harmful to our credi-
bility with allies around the globe—and
it is harmful. It is a gift to several of
our greatest adversaries.
Here is what President Trump’s ab-
rupt decision to pull U.S. ground forces
from Syria has achieved. He has cre-
ated almost overnight a power vacuum
in which ISIS can regroup and wreak
havoc again. According to recent news
reports, ISIS fighters are cheering
President Trump’s decision on social
media channels viewed around the
world.
Just this week, our Secretary of De-
fense confirmed that over 100 ISIS pris-
oners have escaped, adding that the
United States does not know where
they are today. And what does our
President say in response to all of this?
He tells us that captured ISIS pris-
oners are secured. Unfortunately, that
does not appear to be true.
And, when presented with the possi-
bility that ISIS prisoners might be re-
leased as a result of his hasty with-
drawal, what did our President say?
This is what he said: ‘‘Well, they’re
going to be escaping to Europe.’’ Think
about that. ‘‘Well, they’re going to be
escaping to Europe.’’
Who do we know in Europe? Do we
have friends? Yes, we do—NATO, which
we have been a part of for half a cen-
tury. They are our friends. They are
our allies.
Somehow, the idea that that is where
the escaped ISIS folks are going to
head is OK. Well, it is not OK. Those
words, in my view, are disgraceful.
As chairman and ranking member of
the Senate Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs Committee for a
number of years, I worked with my col-
leagues—Democrats and Republicans
alike—and others to find ways to effec-
tively combat ISIS.
Of course, it was critical to degrade
and destroy ISIS extremists overseas
on the battlefield, but, unfortunately,
in today’s day and age, ISIS’s message
of hate doesn’t need a visa and doesn’t
need a plane ticket to reach our shores.
It has been just as important to find
ways to counter ISIS’s abhorrent and
twisted messages in order to prevent
the radicalization of American citizens
right here at home, in the United
States of America.
We worked tirelessly during the
Obama administration to reach out to
communities across our country and
worked with local officials, with faith
leaders, and with family members to
combat terrorist groups’ efforts to
radicalize and recruit our own citi-
zens—our own citizens who might be
vulnerable to their hateful ideology.
ISIS fighters never have to step foot
on American soil to spread their hate
and inspire unspeakable violence. For
our President to brush off the escape of
100 or more of these prisoners and say
it is not our problem because they will
go to Europe I think is callous. I think
it is thoughtless. It is foolish, and it
demonstrates a fundamental lack of
understanding of the ever-evolving ter-
rorist threats we face in this world
today.
President Trump’s decision to pull
out of Syria without a plan to protect
our gains hasn’t just energized ISIS
fighters there. It has also given Rus-
sian President Vladimir Putin a long-
desired foothold in the Middle East.
Just yesterday, President Putin and
Erdogan announced that their forces
will jointly establish and patrol a 20-
mile-wide safe zone along the Syrian-
Turkish border.
I don’t know if we can look at this.
Here is Syria. Turkey is up here. Close
to the Euphrates, there is an area
there, about a 20-mile safe zone, that
will be patrolled not by the Syrian
Kurds but by the folks from Russia and
the soldiers from Turkey.
If the Kurds want help fighting
Erdogan’s ethnic cleansing and chem-
ical attacks, instead of turning to the
United States, they now have only an-
other dictator to turn to, and that is
Vladimir Putin. And because we left
the region without a plan for exit, Mr.
Putin has secured an important public
relations win of his own.
At least one base where American
forces used to work side by side with
Kurdish forces in Syria to gather and
share critical intelligence regarding
ISIS’s movements—now it not in our
hands, not in the hands of the Syrian
Kurds, but it is in Russian hands. You
know what they are doing with that
change of hands? They are tweeting
their videos to prove it and laughing
all the way to—I don’t know—where
ever they go.
If empowering Russia, Erdogan, and
ISIS wasn’t enough, President Trump’s
decision to leave the region also cre-
ates a golden opportunity for Iranian
hardliners to achieve a long-desired
goal of their own—that is, to establish

a land bridge across the Middle East in
order to further antagonize our allies
the Israelis.
President Trump has repeatedly
promised to fulfill his campaign prom-
ise to end what he calls America’s end-
less wars. We should not be fooled. Not
one war has ended during his Presi-
dency. In fact, more troops have actu-
ally been deployed to the Middle East
than have come home.
Today, roughly 200,000 U.S. troops are
deployed all around the globe. Some of
those troops are in war zones, in places
like Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, and a
small number remain in Syria. Even
more troops remain overseas from leg-
acy missions, in places like Japan, Ger-
many, the Philippines, and Australia.
For instance, right now more than
28,000 U.S. troops are stationed in
South Korea. Just 2 weeks ago, Presi-
dent Trump announced that he would
be sending an additional 3,000 troops to
Saudi Arabia.
Prior to President Trump’s reckless
withdrawal from Syria, there were
roughly 1,000 American troops sta-
tioned in the northeastern corner of
that country. Compared to America’s
military presence elsewhere, that is a
small fraction. Think about that. Some
200,000 American troops are spread
around the world. Roughly 1,000 of
them, which is less than one-half of 1
percent, were serving in this part of
the world, in Syria.
In spite of their strategic presence,
President Trump chose to abruptly pull
a small number of troops out of Syria.
As it turns out, with the death of John
McCain, I am the last Vietnam veteran
serving in the U.S. Senate. I know well
what it is like to come home from a
long deployment. When I was with my
squadron, we deployed overseas 6
months three times to Southeast Asia.
I agree that we cannot afford to en-
tangle our men and women in uniform
in endless conflicts around the globe. It
is not fair to them, and it is not fair to
their families. But what Donald Trump
has achieved is not a carefully nego-
tiated cease-fire to shore up the gains
we have made against ISIS and to ful-
fill our commitments to the allies who
helped us along the way. Oh, no, make
no mistake, this is a retreat.
The last thing I will say is this: I am
not alone. In fact, I am far from alone
in criticizing this administration’s de-
cision with respect to the withdrawal
of a small number of troops from Syria.
In the past week, I have been joined
by some unlikely colleagues to warn
about the dangers of Mr. Trump’s Syria
policy. We have also heard from top na-
tional security officials, past and
present—in uniform and out of uni-
form—who have extensive experience
when it comes to American foreign pol-
icy and military policy.
Just last week, a senior member of
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee described the Trump adminis-
tration’s decision to pull American
troops out of Syria as—in his words—
‘‘out of line’’ and also as ‘‘dangerous.’’
That Senator also warned that—
these are his words—‘‘ISIS is the big-
gest beneficiary.’’ That is what he said.
‘‘ISIS is the biggest beneficiary.’’ Of
what? Of the administration’s abrupt
decision to pull U.S. troops out of
Syria and leave our Kurdish allies open
to predictable invasion and, unfortu-
nately, likely slaughter by the Turks.
You might be surprised to learn
those remarks were made by a Repub-
lican colleague from South Carolina,
someone who was also in uniform in his
life, LINDSEY GRAHAM.
Another one of our colleagues stood
right here on the Senate floor this last
week and said that President Trump’s
decision to abandon our Kurdish allies
‘‘strikes at American honor.’’ He goes
on to say: ‘‘What we have done to the
Kurds will stand as a bloodstain’’—as a
bloodstain—‘‘in American history.’’ He
went on to say that the ceasefire deal
described last week by Vice President
PENCE as a victory—and these are
words of our colleague—‘‘does not
change the fact that America aban-
doned an ally, adding insult to dis-
honor.’’
That Senator went on to say:
The administration speaks cavalierly, even
flippantly, even as our ally has suffered
death from casualty. Their homes have been
burned and their families have been torn
apart.
Again, those are the words of not a
Democratic colleague but a Republican
colleague—our friend from Utah, Sen-
ator MITT ROMNEY.
Just this past weekend, we were
warned by a highly decorated, retired
U.S. Marine Corps general, one who
served in the Persian Gulf war, one
who served in the war in Afghanistan,
and one who served in the Iraq war. In
his warning, he said that the adminis-
tration’s abrupt withdrawal of U.S.
troops from the Syrian-Turkish border
will lead to ‘‘disarray’’—disarray in
Syria—and that ‘‘ISIS will resurge.’’
Those are not my words, not a Demo-
crat’s words, but the words of Presi-
dent Trump’s former Defense Sec-
retary, Gen. Jim Mattis, affectionately
known as ‘‘Mad Dog.’’
Colleagues, I am not describing a
misguided foreign policy here today. I
am describing an abandonment of the
values that we as Americans have em-
braced since the founding of our de-
mocracy. I am going to say that again.
I am not describing a misguided for-
eign policy—oh, no. I am describing
something much bigger than that—an
abandonment of the values that we as
Americans have embraced since the
founding of our democracy.
A bipartisan group of Senators, in-
cluding myself, have introduced a
package of sanctions that ought to be
passed and imposed on Turkey. These
sanctions are stronger than the ones
President Trump imposed on Turkey
this week, which he has already, appar-
ently, lifted. He lifted those sanctions
as part of the retreat negotiated by his
administration, and he lifted those
sanctions in the face of evidence that
Turkish forces continue to attack
Kurds outside of the agreed-upon safe
zone and continue to commit possible
war crimes. But even strong sanctions
such as those contained in our bill, if
passed, would not solve the urgent cri-
sis President Trump has created by
abandoning our Kurdish allies.
Here is what the President said in
the last week or two: ‘‘I alone can fix
it.’’
Well, Mr. President, for once, that
might be true. You alone can fix it.
After a single phone call with an au-
thoritarian leader, you created this
mess, and maybe you alone can reverse
that decision. I urge you to do so. In
fact, I think we urge you to do so.
Don’t turn your back on the Kurds.
Don’t give up on the gains against ISIS
that our service men and women, along
with our allies, fought for so bravely.
That would be leadership. That would
protect our national security. And that
is what the American people and our
allies look to the President of the
United States to do.
Tom Friedman, a noted author and
columnist for the New York Times and
someone who has been here in the Cap-
itol a number of times, has something
he calls the Trump Doctrine. He said
the Trump Doctrine is—it goes some-
thing like this: Barack built it. I,
Trump, broke it. You fix it.
I want to turn the Trump Doctrine
on its head and say: No, no, no, Mr.
President. You broke it. It can be fixed,
and you need to do the fixing.
With that, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SUL-
LIVAN). The Senator from Virginia.
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I thank
my colleague from Delaware for his
comments.
I rise to continue to speak about the
U.S. retreat from Syria and our alli-
ance with our Kurdish allies.
The hasty withdrawal of the United
States from northern Syria produced
vivid and painful pictures of U.S.
troops being pelted with stones and
rotting vegetables as they walked away
from the Kurdish allies they had stood
alongside in the fight against ISIS for
years—those Kurdish allies who had
fought so valiantly with the United
States—our best battlefield partners—
in the defeat of ISIS.
The Trump retreat has been pitched
by the President as a great victory for
American foreign policy. It isn’t. It is a
grave failure that will ultimately
make our country less safe. It is paving
the way for potential ethnic cleansing.
That has been testified to by adminis-
tration officials.
In the last 2 weeks, 176,000 Kurds—
more than half of them children—have
been displaced.
President Trump claims that the
Kurds understand we are doing them a
great service. That is just flatly wrong.
The Trump retreat empowers Russia,
empowers Iran, empowers the Syrian
dictator, Bashar al-Assad, who is an
international pariah because he is re-
sponsible for human suffering at an un-
imaginable scale, and it also empowers

October 24, 2019
Turkey, which, despite being a NATO
member, has undergone a troubling
slide toward authoritarianism.
The Trump retreat has led us to
abandon a steadfast U.S. ally, the Syr-
ian Kurds. It is more than just aban-
doning them and walking away from
them; the President reached out per-
sonally to say that they were no an-
gels, thrashing them on the way out of
the door. For what reason?
The Trump retreat has already led to
more than 100 ISIS prisoners escaping,
according to the testimony of the spe-
cial Ambassador who has been charged
to be the envoy for the region, Ambas-
sador Jeffrey. The President declared
that they had ‘‘been largely recap-
tured,’’ but when Ambassador Jeffrey
was asked yesterday about the Presi-
dent’s claim, he stated: ‘‘We do not
know where they are.’’
Based on testimony from military
leadership and diplomats—testimony
which was just read by Senator CAR-
PER—it is pretty clear that the Presi-
dent has increased the likelihood of a
resurgence of ISIS with this move. We
hope that does not happen, but it has
largely been predicted by our defense
leaders.
What is the grand strategy here? If
you look at this highly consequential
decision, which is literally a life-and-
death decision, and you look at how it
was made, it becomes pretty clear to
me that there wasn’t a grand strategy.
President Trump encouraged a career
State Department diplomat, Ambas-
sador Jim Jeffrey, who spent his whole
life in this region, to come out of re-
tirement and take a portfolio of re-
sponsibility for Syria and the anti-ISIS
campaign. Ambassador Jeffrey was
charged directly with this task, but
Ambassador Jeffrey testified before the
Foreign Relations Committee the other
day that he was not even asked or con-
sulted about the cause of action that
this President took.
Imagine how that would make you
feel. You have retired. You are re-
cruited by the President to come and
lead the coalition against ISIS, to be
responsible for the Syrian portfolio.
The President makes a life-and-death
decision about the Syrian mission and
does not even ask you for your advice
about it. This speaks volumes about
the chaotic nature of the retreat.
In July, Ambassador Jeffrey an-
nounced—and this was good news—that
he and the team had convinced Britain
and France to add troops to the mis-
sion—the anti-ISIS mission in Syria—
to deal with this ISIS threat. That was
announced 2 to 3 months ago. But what
we heard after President Trump’s an-
nouncement was that he did not con-
sult with Britain and France, the na-
tions that had made commitments and
then bulked up their troop strength in
the area. President Macron of France
said he heard of President Trump’s de-
cision by tweet.
So when neither the U.S. Ambassador
charged with the responsibility of this
mission, nor the British and French al-
lies, who are also together with us on
the battlefield, were consulted about
this, that adds to the sense of chaos.
I believe this: If the administration
had come to Congress 3 months ago or
3 weeks ago and said: Here is our pro-
posal. We want to empower Russia,
Turkey, Iran, and Assad. We want to
raise the risk of ISIS reconstituting.
We want to walk away from the Kurds.
We want to make other allies wonder
about whether we will be loyal to
them. And we want to send a message
that protecting oil wells is more impor-
tant than protecting allies—if the ad-
ministration had come to the Armed
Services or Foreign Relations Com-
mittee and said ‘‘We have an idea. This
is what we want to do. What do you
think?’’ I know what we would have
done. I think virtually everyone in the
body would have asked questions but
would have laughed the strategy out of
the room.
But the President didn’t come to
Congress, didn’t come to the relevant
committees to share his thought or his
idea about what should be done. In-
stead, he took the unilateral action,
and now we are seeing the con-
sequences of the Trump retreat.
The Trump retreat was promoted at
a press conference by the President
yesterday with a branding, and the
branding was ‘‘Mission Accomplished
and Promise Kept.’’ That branding sent
a very bizarre, chaotic, and contradic-
tory message: We are protecting oil-
fields but not our allies from ISIS. We
are pulling out of the region, but we
are also putting thousands more troops
in Saudi Arabia. We are pulling out of
the region, but we have, in fact, added
14,000 more troops to the gulf since
May. We are pulling back from the safe
zone that we spent months trying to
implement, just to put Russia in
charge of that safe zone. We are em-
powering dictators, but we are aban-
doning allies. We are sending the signal
in Saudi Arabia that the reason we are
putting troops there is, as the Presi-
dent said, because they will pay for it,
sending the message that our military
are now mercenaries, that we would go
to the country where the country will
pay for it regardless of the human
rights situation in that country.
The withdrawal has made it very dif-
ficult for anybody to think about
partnering with us in the future
against a threat like ISIS.
The Syrian Kurds and the Iraqi
Kurds, by the way, are both very, very
strong partners in the battle against
ISIS. If ISIS does resurge, the normal
reaction would be to go to our best bat-
tlefield partners and ask them if they
would help us to defeat ISIS. The
President has made it virtually impos-
sible for us to go back to the Syrian
Kurds and say: OK, well, now can you
help us defeat ISIS again? And I think
the President’s actions this week have
sent a message to other nations as well
that when the United States asks you
to get on the battlefield, you have to
be worried about whether the United
States will abandon you when it has
decided your time is up.
I want America—and I know the Pre-
siding Officer does as well because of
his background—to be the country that
tells the world ‘‘You can count on us,’’
not the country about which the world
says ‘‘Don’t believe a word they say.’’
In my capacity as a member of the
Senate Armed Services and the Senate
Foreign Relations Committees, I have
spoken with a number of Senate col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle about
what we can do because I don’t think
the President is going to reverse
course. But there are things we can do
as the article I branch here to repair
some of this or at least start on the
road to repair.
There is strong bipartisan support for
the passage of the Risch-Menendez bill,
which provides a path forward. This is
a bill that deals with sanctioning Tur-
key for its behavior and calling the ad-
ministration forward to present us
with the anti-ISIS plan that should
exist right now. I urge the Senate to
take up that bill and pass it imme-
diately. It has strong bipartisan sup-
port.
I further urge the Senate to pass ei-
ther the House resolution condemning
the President’s action or the resolution
that Senator MCCONNELL has intro-
duced to condemn the President’s ac-
tion. I think either or both of those
would be strong statements that the
Senate could make.
For some reason that has not yet
been explained, the administration has
refrained from implementing the man-
datory CAATSA sanctions against Tur-
key following Turkey’s purchase of the
S–400 missile system from Russia.
These are mandatory sanctions. By
law, the President was supposed to
have implemented them by now.
We have heard from Brett McGurk,
who is working in the region, that
Vladimir Putin has looked at Ameri-
cans and said: Hey, look, Turkey
bought our system, and you guys
haven’t sanctioned Turkey yet, so you
are a paper tiger.
The actions of these sanctions are
noticed in the region, and the region is
wondering: They are mandatory. Yet
the United States isn’t implementing
the sanctions. Why not?
I call on the administration to re-
verse this decision and immediately
implement the sanctions to send an im-
portant message to both Turkey and
Russia.
I call on Congress and the adminis-
tration to be focused on the need for
increased humanitarian assistance in
the region. The 176,000 Kurds who have
been displaced from their land already
are likely to be followed by tens or
hundreds of thousands more, and we
should focus on what we might do in
the humanitarian space to assist them.
I believe that humanitarian assistance
to international NGOs is important
and, also, I would argue, humanitarian
assistance to the KRG—to the
Kurdistan Regional Government.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6150 October 24, 2019
Naturally, as the Kurds leave the
space in northern Syria under attack
from Turkey, one of the places they are
likely to go is to Kurdistan and north-
ern Iraq. In the first 10 days, nearly
9,000 Kurdish refugees from Syria have
crossed the border into Iraq.
So as we are looking to humanitarian
assistance to deal with the scope of
this crisis created by President
Trump’s action, I hope we will consider
humanitarian support to the KRG as
Kurds cross the border.
I call on Congress to pass the bill
that has been introduced by Senators
WARNER and BLUMENTHAL, which would
provide special immigrant visa oppor-
tunities for Kurdish translators and
others who have worked alongside our
military. This is something we have
had a good track record of doing with
people who supported our troops in
Iraq and supported our troops in Af-
ghanistan and then are left in harm’s
way because of that support. Those on
the Kurdish side who have worked to-
gether with our troops in northern
Syria, I think, should be extended the
same special immigrant visa status.
The administration should be asked
to come to both Houses of Congress and
testify about the plan to prevent a re-
surgent ISIS. This is something Ameri-
cans should be afraid of. Maybe the ad-
ministration has a plan about how they
will try to protect against that hap-
pening, but whether they have a plan
or not, they should come to Congress,
and we should ask them about it.
Finally, I want the White House to
release the transcript of the call be-
tween President Trump and President
Erdogan in which this deal was hashed.
When I heard the testimony of Ambas-
sador Jeffrey at the hearing yester-
day—the testimony was public—that
he wasn’t consulted and that the Brit-
ish and French, who have just recently
put in troops, weren’t consulted, I still
have real questions about why this de-
cision was made. I believe those ques-
tions would largely be answered if the
transcript of the call between Presi-
dents Erdogan and Trump were deliv-
ered, whether in a classified or other
context to Congress, so I call on the
White House to release the transcript.
I am going to conclude with this:
Along with many of our colleagues
today, I gathered here in the Chamber
at 10:30 to go over to the memorial
service for Elijah Cummings, and it
was a powerful one. It was a powerful
one. Not many Members of Congress—
Senate or House—lie in state in the
Capitol, and it was a moving occasion.
I knew Elijah Cummings pretty well,
being kind of a next-door neighbor of
Virginia and Maryland. Over the years,
we did a number of events together.
One of the things that Representative
Cummings used to say in one of these
voices that sounded like it was coming
out of the Old Testament—you know,
it was a fire-and-brimstone voice—was
this powerful, powerful statement: ‘‘We
are better than this.’’
He would say that, and when he
would say it, he would say it about a
number of circumstances. He said it
probably most recently, most vividly,
when pictures emerged of children in
cages at the border. But he would often
say it, and he would say it to criticize
actions. It would sound like a tough
criticism.
But as some of the eulogists today
were mentioning that statement of
Representative Cummings, I thought
about ‘‘We are better than this,’’ what
it means, and it suddenly struck me as
not a critical statement. It suddenly
struck me as an extremely optimistic
and positive statement. I hadn’t really
thought of it that way until I heard it
earlier today.
Why do I say it was optimistic and
positive? The statement ‘‘We are better
than this’’ says that whatever the im-
perfections of the day, we are really
more defined by our ideals than our im-
perfections. We are more defined by
our values than our vices. And, sure,
when he would use that statement, he
would be criticizing an imperfection of
the day—a bad decision or bad policy—
but he would be criticizing it by saying
that we as a country, we as a Congress,
we as a Senate, even we as individuals
are actually better than this. Our
ideals are better than the way we are
acting right now.
If you look at reality, you can define
it by its imperfection or you can try to
define it by its ideals, and I would like
to have a judge who looked at me and
judged me by my ideals more than my
imperfections, even while calling me to
live up to my ideals.
The fact that an Elijah Cummings,
who had suffered throughout his life
many kinds of second-class treatment
of discrimination, even being routed
into special ed classes as a kid because
people thought he was slow when he
was actually really, really gifted, the
fact that he would go through life and
still believe so strongly that our coun-
try’s values and ideals were a more ac-
curate reflection of who we are than
our imperfections and vices is some-
thing that I found pretty inspirational
as I thought about his life.
I do believe we are better than this
with respect to this particular issue. I
think we are better than abandoning
battlefield allies. I think we are better
than empowering authoritarian dicta-
torships. I think we are better than
suggesting we care more about oil than
we care about people. I think we are
better than facilitating ethnic cleans-
ing of a proud population, including
kids. I think we are better than this.
So in the spirit of Representative
Cummings, I am going to define us as a
nation, us as a Senate, us as individ-
uals more by our ideals than by our im-
perfect actions and then call us to live
up to it. There are concrete steps we
can take—some of which I have out-
lined—that I think will be more in tune
with who we actually are and the
ideals we hold.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CUBA
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the trav-
el section of the New York Times on
Sunday, October 6, 2019, included a
lengthy article about the extraor-
dinary music of Cuba and the rich cul-
ture that has developed over many gen-
erations around the creation and per-
formance of music in that country. The
article is too long to insert into the
RECORD, but I encourage all Senators
to read it as it describes in colorful de-
tail the unique creativity, ingenuity,
and complexity of Cuban music that
derives from the infinite variety of
sounds, instruments, artistry, and tal-
ents of Cuban musicians drawing on
their African, Haitian, and European
heritage.
I mention this because it is illus-
trative of the many aspects of Cuban
society today that Americans should
be able to experience for themselves.
The Cuban people, who endure many
hardships, are as resilient, ingenious,
and hard-working as any people I have
met. Despite an economy broken by
mismanagement that discourages pri-
vate initiative, a one-party political
system that punishes dissent, racial,
and gender inequality, and only dreams
for a better future, they know how to
enjoy life’s pleasures and to make
strangers feel welcome.
Unfortunately, rather than encour-
aging Americans to travel to Cuba to
experience Cuban society and build re-
lations with the Cuban people, as we do
with people living under other auto-
cratic governments, President Trump
has slammed the door.
Egged on by a handful of Cuban-
American hardliners in the White
House, the State Department, and Con-
gress—few, if any, of whom have ever
set foot in Cuba—the President has
adopted a bankrupt approach toward
that country that is steeped in hypoc-
risy.
These are the same people who for
years have unreservedly supported

spending hundreds of millions of dol-
lars on TV and Radio Marti, despite
abundant evidence that they were lit-
tle more than anti-Cuba propaganda
broadcasts masquerading as objective
journalism. Finally, thanks to a recent
investigation, the Office of Cuba
Broadcasting has new leadership and
reforms are underway. Those reforms
should include relocating the Office to
Washington, DC, where it would be less
vulnerable to the political interference
and ideological influence that has
plagued it in the past.
Every few weeks or months, this
White House devises a new way to
ratchet up pressure on the Cuban Gov-
ernment and, in doing so, cause greater
hardship for the Cuban people on whose
behalf the White House professes to
act. The latest was announced last
week, when the Commerce Department
said it is revoking licenses for aircraft
leases to Cuban airlines and will deny
future applications for aircraft leases.
It will also expand sanctions to cover
more foreign goods containing as little
as 10 percent U.S. content.
Since this, like other sanctions
against Cuba, will backfire, there is
only one rational explanation: The
White House, and their enablers in
Congress, care little about the impact
of these punitive policies on the Cuban
people. They are motivated by personal
and ideological animus.
The White House has imposed oner-
ous restrictions on travel by Ameri-
cans who want, and have a right, to
visit Cuba as they can to every other
country, except North Korea, and by
Cubans who want to visit or resettle in
the United States. Just to apply for a
U.S. visa, Cubans must now travel to a
third country at a cost of hundreds of
dollars that very few can afford. Cuban
entrepreneurs, whose fledgling small
businesses depend on American cus-
tomers, have seen their incomes plunge
as visits to Cuba by Americans have
fallen by 50 percent.
For the first time that I can remem-
ber, Cubans with claims of being
threatened and arrested for their polit-
ical activism in Cuba and who have re-
quested asylum in this country have
been locked up in U.S. jails and de-
ported.
The White House has severely limited
remittances, on which many Cuban
families depend. President Trump ap-
parently believes it is his prerogative
to dictate to Cuban-Americans how
much—or how little—of their hard-
earned income they can send to needy
relatives.
The State Department ordered the
departure of U.S. Embassy personnel
from Havana and Cuban Embassy per-
sonnel from Washington, which has
brought diplomacy to a virtual halt.
Discussions on a wide range of topics,
from public health to climate change
that began under President Obama
have all but ceased, and our top dip-
lomat, Secretary of State Pompeo, has
nothing but praise for a failed policy
that is completely at odds with the
mission of his Department. Exhaustive
investigations have not produced any
evidence that illnesses suffered by U.S.
Government personnel in Havana that
triggered the ordered departure were
caused by the Cuban Government, as
some initially charged. Yet, 3 years
later, our Embassy is barely func-
tioning with a skeleton staff, and the
State Department has done nothing to
try to mitigate the adverse impact this
is having on our relations with Cuba.
Under President Obama, negotiations
began to seek a resolution of the
thorny issue of expropriated property
claims. The Trump White House sum-
marily abandoned that process and has
instead encouraged lawsuits against
American companies that want to do
business in Cuba, if doing so involves
property confiscated during the Cuban
revolution 60 years ago. Airports, sea-
ports, warehouses, hotels, homes, and
restaurants, many of which were once
owned by Cuban elites who profited off
the spoils of the U.S.-supported Batista
dictatorship, are now off limits. This is
a legitimate issue that needs to be ad-
dressed, but tying up U.S. courts for
years and hurting American companies
is not the way to do it.
The White House has insisted that
each of these and other punitive ac-
tions is designed to bring democracy to
Cuba and human rights to the Cuban
people. And I have little doubt that
creative minds in the White House will
conjure up additional sanctions in the
coming months. None of them will
achieve those goals or anything posi-
tive for Cuba or its people.
Anyone who knows Cuba, and who
knows the Cuban Government, under-
stands the fallacy of the White House’s
approach. I wish it were otherwise, but
human rights have not improved since
President Trump announced his puni-
tive policy 3 years ago. In fact the situ-
ation is worse, as the recent re-arrests
of Jose Daniel Ferrer, Berta Soler, and
other dissidents illustrates. As access
to the Internet in Cuba has increased,
so has persecution of critics of the gov-
ernment. With only a handful of staff
at our Embassy in Havana, there is no
one to regularly interact with the
Cuban dissident community or their
families.
Cuba is no closer to being a multi-
party democracy than it was 3 years
ago, nor is the Cuban Government any
closer to withdrawing its support for
Nicolas Maduro despite his corrupt,
abusive, and disastrous reign in Ven-
ezuela. So yes, we have profound dis-
agreements. But while the administra-
tion continues to tighten the screws on
Cuba, making the lives of the Cuban
people even more difficult, President
Trump sings the praises of other for-
eign dictators and pretends to be con-
cerned about corruption in Ukraine.
He called Egypt’s President al-Sisi a
great leader. He invited President
Erdogan to the White House. He ad-
mires Vladimir Putin and Roberto
Duterte. He has spoken endearingly of
Kim Jung Un, and he has praised Xi
Jinping and the Saudi Crown Prince.
How can one possibly reconcile em-
bracing these ruthless, corrupt
strongmen while at the same time
throwing the book at Cuba, a tiny, im-
poverished country that poses no
threat to the United States and whose
people want closer ties with the United
States?
This is what happens when national
policy is subverted by local politics,
when promises derived from campaign
contributions take precedence over the
national interest, when family griev-
ances and the personal vindictiveness
of a few with political influence tram-
ple on the aspirations of the majority
of Americans.
This administration’s policy toward
Cuba is no different from past failed at-
tempts to force the Cuban Government
to transform itself into a democracy,
or to incite the Cuban people to rise up
and overthrow it. It has not worked,
and it won’t work. And in the mean-
time, the Russians are eagerly filling
the vacuum, only this time it is 90
miles from Florida, not 6,000 miles
away in Syria. Russia’s Prime Minister
Medvedev visited Cuba just 3 weeks
ago.
No one is saying that we should pro-
vide aid or sell weapons to the Cuban
Government the way this administra-
tion does to despotic governments in
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the Phil-
ippines.
No one is saying that we should not
criticize the Cuban Government for its
repressive policies and its abuse of
those who speak out for greater polit-
ical, economic, and journalistic free-
dom.
No one is saying that we should ex-
cuse Cuba’s support for Maduro or for
the corrupt and repressive Ortega Gov-
ernment in Nicaragua.
What we are saying is that pursuing
a policy that has failed for more than
half a century is nonsensical, indefen-
sible, and wrong. It has achieved none
of its objectives, while it is harming
the Cuban people and infringing on the
rights of the American people.
And if we are serious about control-
ling the spread of deadly viruses; miti-
gating the effects of climate change;
combating organized crime, drug traf-
ficking, and human trafficking; pro-
tecting fisheries and other marine re-
sources; addressing the causes of mi-
gration; expanding export markets for
American companies; and countering
the influence of Russia and China in
this hemisphere, we need to engage
with every one of our neighbors wheth-
er we agree with their policies or not.
I hope the new National Security Ad-
visor will review this policy. I hope he
will put it to the test of time and com-
mon sense. I hope he will assess wheth-
er it is achieving its objectives and
whether it is serving our national in-
terests. I hope he will ensure that the
right people, who will put the national
interest first, are the architects of our
policy toward Cuba. And I hope he will

POLIO
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today is
World Polio Day, and I want to com-
ment briefly about the funding to sup-
port global polio eradication efforts in
the Senate version of the fiscal year
2020 Department of State and Foreign
Operations appropriations bill, which
was reported unanimously by the Ap-
propriations Committee on September
26.
Polio is a highly infectious, crip-
pling, and potentially fatal disease.
While there is no cure, there are safe
and effective vaccines. The global
strategy to eradicate polio, therefore,
focuses on preventing infection by im-
munizing every child until trans-
mission stops and the world is polio-
free.
Through the U.S. Agency for Inter-
national Development, USAID, the
United States provides financial sup-
port and technical leadership around
the world to support the eradication
strategy. USAID focuses specifically on
recognizing and raising the importance
of identifying and reaching mobile pop-
ulations, cross-border coordination,
communications, and the need for more
women vaccinators and community-
based disease surveillance.
Since global polio eradication efforts
began 30 years ago, when cases num-
bered 350,000 annually, polio has been
eliminated in more than 120 countries
and remains endemic in only three—Af-
ghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan.
While significant progress has been
made, much work remains. Cases of
polio persist in insecure areas and in
countries with porous borders and
large migratory populations, posing
considerable obstacles to eradication.
However, while there have been real
setbacks, and the goal posts continue
to change, complacency is not an op-
tion.
To that end, the Appropriations Com-
mittee has recommended $61 million in
fiscal year 2020—an increase of $2 mil-
lion over last year—for USAID’s polio
eradication activities. Increased re-
sources are necessary to get over the
finish line in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and
Pakistan, and to demonstrate the con-
tinued U.S. commitment to polio eradi-
cation. It is our hope that this increase
will cause other donors to follow our
example.
I am not alone in my support for
these activities. The State and Foreign
Operations Subcommittee heard from
more than 20 members, Republicans
and Democrats, requesting funding for
global polio eradication efforts in fiscal
year 2020.
So while many Senators have advo-
cated for this critical funding, I want
to be sure that all 100 Senators are
aware of these efforts which are essen-
tial to achieving a polio-free world.
REMEMBERING ELIJAH CUMMINGS
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, my
heart is heavy today as we mourn the
loss of Congressman Elijah Cummings.
He was a powerful voice for the people
of Baltimore, a champion of justice for
our country, and a dear friend to me
and so many others.
I first met Elijah when he was elect-
ed to the Maryland House of Delegates,
where I was the speaker, but our lives
had intersected in formative ways even
before that. We both grew up in Balti-
more and shared a deep and abiding
love for the city. We went to the same
high school—Baltimore City College
High School—and we both earned law
degrees from the University of Mary-
land before balancing private law prac-
tices with public service in the Mary-
land General Assembly.
So when I met Elijah, I couldn’t help
but feel a kinship with him, but I think
that was perhaps just Elijah’s power—
the ability to build kinship with any-
one and the commitment to do so with
everyone. He was constantly searching
for common ground, always looking to
make human connections. As a result,
he developed meaningful friendships
with people all over the political, so-
cial, religious, and geographic map.
Elijah’s talent for building con-
sensus, as well as his work ethic and
dedication to his constituents, pro-
pelled him early on to positions of
leadership in the Maryland House of
Delegates. There, he became the
youngest ever chairman of the Legisla-
tive Black Caucus and the first African
American to be named speaker pro
tempore. He served in that chamber for
14 years, during which he worked tire-
lessly to advance the rights and oppor-
tunities of Maryland residents.
Then, in 1996, Elijah was elected to
represent Maryland’s Seventh District,
including our home of Baltimore, in
the U.S. House of Representatives. He
filled a seat previously occupied by
civil rights legacies Parren Mitchell
and Kweisi Mfume, and, let me tell
you, there was no person more pre-
pared to carry on their fight for equal-
ity and freedom.
Elijah was the son of sharecroppers
who worked the same land in South
Carolina where his ancestors had been
enslaved. His parents moved to Balti-
more to build a better life for their
family, but the city was rife with ra-
cial intolerance. From a young age,
Elijah faced prejudice and discrimina-
tion. He attended a segregated elemen-
tary school, and he was pelted with
bottles, rocks, and jeers when he and
other children integrated the local pub-
lic swimming pool.
In the face of all that hatred, he
found the hope and determination to
overcome every obstacle set before him
so that he could rise up and lift others
up too. He worked diligently, excelling
as an undergraduate at Howard Univer-
sity, going to law school even though
people told him he could never become
a lawyer, successfully practicing law,
and then launching a career of public
service that led him to the U.S. Con-
gress. Elijah continued to climb until
he was elected Chairman of the House
Oversight Committee.
All the while, he remained firmly
based in his community. He lived in
the same house in West Baltimore for
more than 30 years—in the inner inner
city, as he put it—and he returned
home every night after a long day of
work in DC. He was known to sit on the
stoop of that house and feed the neigh-
borhood pigeons. And every Sunday, he
went to church, where he was often
met by a line of people waiting to share
their concerns, and he would listen to
them and try to help them all.
Elijah never for a moment forgot
that his purpose was to represent the
folks back home in his district, to be a
voice for the many who were silenced.
He once said that while it was his
‘‘constitutional duty to conduct over-
sight of the executive branch,’’ it was
his ‘‘moral duty’’ to fight for his con-
stituents. And fight, he did. In the 23
years that he spent in Congress, he was
a fierce advocate for his district, espe-
cially for Baltimore. Where others saw
problems and danger, he saw opportu-
nities and solutions. He advanced
measures to improve education, to ex-
pand affordable housing, to curb addic-
tion, to enhance public infrastructure,
to promote gun safety, and to reform
police practices. He worked to erase
the racial and class divides that he had
grown up with, so that future genera-
tions of Baltimoreans would not face
the same obstacles he did.
Although he never shied away from
contentious issues, he also understood
when harmony and healing were need-
ed. After the tragic death of Freddie
Gray, Elijah went to the streets to ask
the citizens of Baltimore to come to-
gether and find a peaceful path for-
ward. Then, true to form, he launched
into action, pushing hard for policies
and programs to help the city recover.
Because of his heroic service to his
constituents, Elijah was beloved by his
community, perhaps more than any
other elected official I have known. His
loss is a devastating blow to Baltimore
and to Elijah’s entire congressional
district.
But it is not just Maryland that will
feel this loss—Elijah’s passing leaves
an unfillable void for the Nation as a
whole. He loved this country deeply.
Elijah believed in the potential of
American ideals, so he held us to the
highest moral standards. In moments
of moral crisis, he would famously re-
mind whoever was listening, ‘‘We are
better than this!’’
He was passionate about rooting out
corruption, protecting our democracy,
and achieving equality and freedom for
all. As chairman of the Oversight Com-
mittee and in life, he fought for what
was right simply because it was right.
And Heaven forbid anyone should stand
between Elijah Cummings and justice,
because, while Elijah was always calm
and respectful, he was never afraid to
hold someone’s feet to the fire.

Cummings has ripped a hole in the fab-

HONORING RADIOMAN 2ND CLASS
FLOYD A. WELLS
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I rise
today to honor the life and patriotism
of Radioman 2nd Class Floyd A. Wells.
A native of Cavalier, ND, he answered
the call to defend his country during
World War II. At the age of 24, he made
the ultimate sacrifice on December 7,
1941, along with 2,402 other soldiers and
sailors during the Japanese attack on
Pearl Harbor.
It was not until earlier this year that
his remains were positively identified,
and on October 1 he was brought home
to be buried at the North Dakota Vet-
erans Cemetery. Attending this burial
were members of his family who trav-
eled from across the Nation to pay
their respects to this beloved member
of their family. Even though most of
them had never met him, together they
mourned the lost blessings of Floyd not
being a part of their family for the past
78 years.
He was remembered as a generous
man and a gifted athlete who had a full
life ahead of him. Floyd’s life could
have included competing in sports at
college and having a family and home
of his own.
Floyd’s burial service was a poignant
reminder of how the sacrifice of heroes
defending our country has an impact
on those who knew and loved them far
into the future. He died so Americans
could live in peace and prosperity. I am
thankful he is now back in his home
State, lying in eternal rest with other
North Dakota heroes, and I am grateful
for the continued work of the many pa-
triots who are committed to identi-
fying the remains of all unknown sol-
diers and bringing them home.
Mr. President, to the family of Ra-
dioman 2nd Class Floyd A. Wells, I join
citizens across the Nation in sending
our sincere condolences. It is heroes
like Floyd whose service has kept our
communities, State, Nation, and world
safe. His life made a difference in the
lives of all of us, and we are forever
grateful.
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
REMEMBERING THOMAS
D’ALESANDRO III
∑ Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I stand
here today to grieve the loss and honor
the memory of Thomas D’Alesandro
III, a true public servant. I feel ex-
tremely fortunate to have benefited
from Tommy’s wisdom, his friendship,
and his example over the years. He will
be dearly missed.
Thomas—or ‘‘Little Tommy,’’ as he
was known—was born in Baltimore in
1929. He grew up in a very politically
active home. His father was a Con-
gressman and three-term mayor of Bal-
timore. His sister, NANCY PELOSI, went
on to become the first female Speaker
of the U.S. House of Representatives.
So, in a sense, it seems that Tommy
was destined for life in the public
sphere. But he never behaved like lead-
ership was his birthright. Whatever the
import his name carried, Tommy was
always humble, always hard-working,
always determined to earn the support
and trust of his community. And that
is exactly what he did. As president of
the Baltimore City Council and then as
the city’s mayor, Tommy was on the
ground, fighting alongside his constitu-
ents for what was right.
Tommy was the mayor of Baltimore
from 1967 to 1971. It was a tumultuous
time for Baltimore and for the entire
Nation. After just 4 months in office,
Tommy had to lead his city through
the grief and unrest that followed the
assassination of Martin Luther King,
Jr. Despite being personally dev-
astated, he did that with courage and
grace. He went on to serve a term
marked by an unyielding commitment
to civil rights.
Tommy passed laws to ban discrimi-
nation in housing and public accom-
modations. He fought the racist prac-
tice of blockbusting in real estate. He
funded anti-poverty programs and new
schools in underserved neighborhoods.
And he appointed more African Ameri-
cans to public posts than any Balti-
more mayor before him, including to
positions that had only previously been
held by White people.
He was a man of ideals, certainly. His
Catholic upbringing instilled in him
the values of generosity and fairness.
He had a nuanced understanding of ra-
cial inequality in the United States,
and he was profoundly disturbed by the
intolerance plaguing the country.
But I believe that he earned the sup-
port and trust of his community be-
cause he didn’t just espouse ideals—he
didn’t simply demand justice or con-
demn hatred. He delivered concrete,
meaningful action to make Baltimore
a more equal and harmonious place.
Tommy did all of this because he sin-
cerely cared, not because it was politi-
cally convenient. In fact, he faced a lot
of criticism for his leadership on civil
rights from those who wished to pre-
serve their own privilege. The easy
thing would have been to turn a blind
eye to the injustices around him and
protect the status quo, but that wasn’t
Tommy. He wasn’t concerned with
what was easy; he was concerned with
what was right. He had a good heart,
and he listened to it.
Even after leaving political office,
Tommy continued to give back as a
mentor and adviser to future leaders. I
am immensely grateful for the counsel
that he offered me as a budding law-
maker. As a Baltimore native myself, I
have long looked up to Tommy and
strived to follow in his footsteps. I can
only hope to emulate his integrity,
bravery, and compassion.
We have lost a hero and a legend but
not a legacy. Tommy was somebody
who always led by example. Even
though he is no longer here with us, his
example lives on. It lives on in the
blossoming Baltimore that he cul-
tivated. It lives on in the generations
of dedicated public servants that he in-
spired. And it lives on in the quest for
justice that he championed.
Nevertheless, this loss is a painful
one. My heart and prayers are with
Tommy’s wife, children, grandchildren,
great-grandchildren, and all of his
loved ones as they grieve and heal.∑

fessions around town. Her STEAM Sat-
urdays bring students together to col-
laborate on science, technology, engi-
neering, arts, and mathematics
projects, and Strides for Sunnyside is a
running group encouraging students to
embrace healthy habits and physical
fitness. Through these programs and
her genuine love for teaching and
learning, Ms. Medalen has made a pro-
found difference at Sunnyside School.
She is an inspiration to her students,
parents and fellow educators across
North Dakota.
Mr. President, I congratulate Sara
Medalen on this well-deserved recogni-
tion. We all remember favorite teach-
ers from our own schooldays, and no
doubt they share many of the good
qualities that Ms. Medalen brings to
her classroom. WalletHub recently
ranked North Dakota as one of the best
States for teachers, and my State has
many top quality educators who are
just as remarkable as Sara Medalen.
We cannot thank them enough for the
positive impact they have every day on
North Dakota students.∑

TRIBUTE TO JOCELYN TAYLOR,
MICHAELA OSBORNE, AND
ADDISON EVANS
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this
week I have the honor of recognizing
Jocelyn Taylor, Michaela Osborne, and
Addison Evans of Cut Bank Middle
School in Glacier County for their ex-
traordinary impact on the local com-
munity.
Jocelyn, Michaela, and Addison all
had grandparents who suffered from
cancer. Because of that, the three
young women wanted to do more in
their community to raise awareness for
cancer with hopes to help folks detect
the disease early.
Jocelyn’s mom, Cherie, suggested
that the girls aim their fundraising ef-
forts towards upgrading the Winkley
Women’s Center mobile mammography
unit that visits Cutbank often. Kali-
spell Regional Healthcare had been
working to raise the funds for a new
unit.
Jocelyn, Michaela, and Addison
joined Kalispell Regional Healthcare at
the Lewis and Clark Festival in July to
bake goods for a bake sale. They man-
aged to raise $109.50 and donated all
proceeds to the cause.
Kalispell Regional Healthcare Foun-
dation shared the story of the girls’ ef-
forts with their supporters, and the
story caught fire. The message about
their donation kept spreading, and on
October 1, $750,000 was raised because
of their dedication and work.
Thanks to the extraordinary efforts
of these inspirational young women,
they were able to make a tremendous
impact on their local community and
raise funds for a cause that can save
Montana lives.
It is my honor to recognize Jocelyn,
Michaela, and Addison for their amaz-
ing endeavor. Montanans across our
State are proud of the work they
achieved, and I look forward to fol-
lowing the future accomplishments of
these bright young women.∑

TRIBUTE TO MICHIGAN’S
VETERANS
∑ Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President,
today I wish to pay special tribute to
the more than 580,000 Michigan resi-
dents who have proudly served in our
Nation’s Armed Forces.
For as long as Michigan has been a
State and even before, our people have
heard the call to serve and bravely
stepped up. From the War of 1812 to
Vietnam, from the Civil War to today’s
fight against terrorism, time and again
the people of Michigan have proudly
worn the uniform and proven their
deep sense of patriotism.
Sergeant Don Burgett of Howell was
one of these people. His story really
could be a major motion picture.
Imagine landing in Normandy on D-
day as a 19-year-old, parachuting into
the Netherlands for Operation Market
Garden, fighting behind German lines
for 72 days, surviving the Battle of the
Bulge, and helping to capture Hitler’s
retreat in Germany.
Sergeant Burgett lost two rifles when
they were shot out of his hands, was
wounded three times, and wrote four
highly acclaimed books about his expe-
rience, one of which received rave re-
views from both President Dwight D.
Eisenhower and historian and author
Stephen E. Ambrose.
Of 200 soldiers in his original com-
pany, only 11 made it home. Sergeant
Burgett was very lucky—and so was
Michigan. He returned to Howell and
kept on serving his fellow veterans and
his community as an active member of
the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the
American Legion, Disabled American
Veterans, and the Military Order of the
Cooties. He passed away in 2017 at age
91.
I was so honored to champion the
legislation that renamed the Howell
Post Office after Sergeant Burgett and
to be there during the renaming cere-
mony this past June. It was touching
to see just how big of an impact one
veteran can have on an entire commu-
nity.
Sergeant Burgett isn’t alone. His
story is just one of so many examples
all across Michigan of veterans serving
their communities.
Whether it is North Oakland VFW
Post 334 donating more than $13,000 to
the VFW National Home for Children
in Eaton Rapids, which serves the chil-
dren and families of veterans; or the
Grand Haven American Legion Squad-
ron 28’s annual Salmon Boil Dinner,
which supports local charities and
events, including Boys and Girls State;
or Amvets members hiking 22 miles
from Howard City to Big Rapids to
bring awareness to veterans suicide
and to connect veterans with services
and support organizations; or Disabled
American Veterans in Detroit hosting
a job fair to help veterans and their
spouses find jobs with employers who
understand their sacrifice; or the Stu-
dent Veterans of America University of
Michigan chapter’s dedication to vol-
unteering, including at Food Gatherers
Community Kitchen in Ann Arbor,
when Michigan veterans hang up their
military uniform, they often put on an-
other, whether as coach, teacher, po-
lice officer, paramedic, firefighter,
elected official, or community volun-
teer. These patriots understand that
service isn’t something you do just
once. Instead, it is a way of living, and
this way of living benefits us all.
Today and every day, we salute
Michigan’s veterans and thank them
for their service, both in our military
and in our communities. They truly
are what makes America great. Thank
you.∑
f
REMEMBERING WILLIAM S. WHITE
∑ Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President,
today I wish to pay tribute to someone
who spent his career in service to oth-
ers, from his Flint neighbors, to com-
munities across the country, to people
around the world, someone whom I was
proud to call my friend.
William S. White may not have been
a native of Michigan—he was born in
Cincinnati in 1937—but he was Michi-
gan through and through, and his devo-
tion to serving the people of his adop-
tive State was truly inspiring.
Bill earned his bachelor of arts from
Dartmouth University in 1959, his mas-
ter’s degree in business administration
from the Tuck School of Business the
next year, and then spent 2 years in the
Army. During that time, he also had
the good sense to fall in love with and
marry a Michigander, Claire Mott of
Flint, whose grandfather, Charles
Stewart Mott, cofounded General Mo-
tors and created the Charles Stewart
Mott Foundation.
Claire’s father, C.S. Harding Mott,
was impressed by Bill’s hard work and
business skills. He brought him on as a
consultant to help modernize the foun-
dation in the wake of the Tax Reform
Act of 1969. Bill did that job so well
that, by 1971, he was named vice presi-
dent and secretary of the foundation
and elected to its board of trustees.
Over the years, Bill’s role grew and
so did the foundation. What started out
as a small organization that mainly
supported local causes in southeastern
Michigan became a philanthropic pow-
erhouse, a $3 billion foundation that is
internationally recognized for its good
work around the globe.
That’s not all Bill’s doing, of course;
he was fortunate to be supported by his
wonderful family and an amazing team.
However, Bill possessed a number of
qualities of leadership that helped
make the Mott Foundation what it is
today.
Bill was creative. He was willing to
think big and take big risks to solve
big problems. Offering $5 million to
help launch the Federal Government’s
21st Century Community Learning
Centers initiative sounded crazy at the
time, but Bill saw a need and a way to
meet it. Today, this program provides
1.7 million children every year with ac-
tivities that strengthen their academic
skills to help them succeed in the
classroom and beyond.
Bill was compassionate. I know just
how hard the Flint water crisis hit him
and how hard he worked to help his
hometown recover. He showed that
same heart whether providing families
with access to clean drinking water,
promoting peace and reconciliation in
post-apartheid South Africa, sup-
porting our Nation’s Historically Black
Colleges and Universities, protecting
our Great Lakes, or helping Gulf Coast
communities rebuild after Hurricane
Katrina.
Above all, Bill was dedicated. He
served as chairman of Mott’s board of
trustees until the day he died. And just
2 days before, he gave an emotional
speech at the Council of Michigan
Foundations’ annual conference inspir-
ing philanthropic leaders to keep doing
good works and sharing their suc-
cesses.

‘‘Tell your stories,’’ he implored
them. ‘‘Tell people what your passion
is. Tell them what your results are.
Tell your stories. Get out there, and
tell them.’’
Bill had passion, and Bill got results.
His story will live on in the foundation
he built, the lives he touched, and all
of the good he did.
My deepest condolences go out to ev-
eryone who loved him, including his
wife Louise Hartwell, his children and
grandchildren, and his many friends
across Michigan and around the world.
Thank you, Bill.∑

SENATE RESOLUTION 377—DESIG-
NATING OCTOBER 30, 2019, AS A
NATIONAL DAY OF REMEM-

THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS PRO-

NER, Mr. BENNET, Mr. PORTMAN, Mr.
BROWN, Mrs. MURRAY, Ms. CANTWELL,
Mr. ROBERTS, Mr. MANCHIN, Mr. RUBIO,
Mr. MARKEY, and Mrs. BLACKBURN) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which
was referred to the Committee on the
Judiciary:
S. RES. 377
Whereas, since World War II, hundreds of
thousands of patriotic men and women, in-
cluding uranium miners, millers, and haul-
ers, have served the United States by build-
ing nuclear weapons for the defense of the
United States;
Whereas dedicated workers paid a high
price for advancing a nuclear weapons pro-
gram at the service and for the benefit of the
United States, including by developing dis-
abling or fatal illnesses;
Whereas the Senate recognized the con-
tributions, services, and sacrifices that those
patriotic men and women made for the de-
fense of the United States in—
(1) Senate Resolution 151, 111th Congress,
agreed to May 20, 2009;
(2) Senate Resolution 653, 111th Congress,
agreed to September 28, 2010;
(3) Senate Resolution 275, 112th Congress,
agreed to September 26, 2011;
(4) Senate Resolution 519, 112th Congress,
agreed to August 1, 2012;
(5) Senate Resolution 164, 113th Congress,
agreed to September 18, 2013;
(6) Senate Resolution 417, 113th Congress,
agreed to July 9, 2014;
(7) Senate Resolution 213, 114th Congress,
agreed to September 25, 2015;
(8) Senate Resolution 560, 114th Congress,
agreed to November 16, 2016;
(9) Senate Resolution 314, 115th Congress,
agreed to October 30, 2017; and
(10) Senate Resolution 682, 115th Congress,
agreed to October 11, 2018;
Whereas a time capsule for a national day
of remembrance has been crossing the United
States, collecting stories and artifacts of
workers of the nuclear weapons program
that relate to the nuclear defense era of the
United States, and a remembrance quilt has
been constructed to memorialize the con-
tribution of those workers;
Whereas the stories and artifacts reflected
in the time capsule and the remembrance
quilt reinforce the importance of recognizing
the workers of the nuclear weapons program
of the United States; and
Whereas those patriotic men and women
deserve to be recognized for the contribu-
tions, services, and sacrifices they made for
the defense of the United States: Now, there-
fore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) designates October 30, 2019, as a na-
tional day of remembrance for the workers
of the nuclear weapons program of the
United States, including the uranium min-
ers, millers, and haulers; and
(2) encourages the people of the United
States to support and participate in appro-
priate ceremonies, programs, and other ac-
tivities to commemorate October 30, 2019, as
a national day of remembrance for past and
present workers of the nuclear weapons pro-
gram of the United States.

MCSALLY, and Mr. SULLIVAN) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which
was referred to the Committee on
Rules and Administration.:
S. RES. 378
Whereas one of the cornerstones of the
American Constitution is due process: the
right to confront your accuser, call wit-
nesses on your behalf, and challenge the ac-
cusations against you;
Whereas the House of Representatives is
abandoning more than a century’s worth of
precedent and tradition in impeachment pro-
ceedings and denying President Trump basic
fairness and due process accorded every
American;
Whereas, in our nation’s history, the House
has on three occasions moved to formally in-
vestigate whether sufficient grounds exist to
impeach a President, and in all three of
these cases, the full House voted on a resolu-
tion authorizing the House Judiciary Com-
mittee to determine whether to impeach the
President;
Whereas, in the case of President Trump, a
formal impeachment process involving de-
bate and a vote by the full House prior to
taking each step in the process has been re-
placed by a press conference by the Speaker
of the House;
Whereas the proposition that the Speaker
acting alone may direct committees to ini-
tiate impeachment proceedings without any
debate or a vote on the House floor is un-
precedented and undemocratic;
Whereas the House is denying President
Trump due process within the ‘‘inquiry’’
itself;
Whereas, for the impeachment investiga-
tions of President Richard M. Nixon and
President William J. Clinton, the House Ju-
diciary Committee adopted rules of proce-
dure to provide due process rights and ensure
fairness;
Whereas these rights included—
(1) allowing the President to be rep-
resented by counsel;
(2) permitting the President’s counsel to be
present at all hearings and depositions;
(3) permitting the President’s counsel to
present evidence and object to the admission
of evidence;
(4) allowing the President’s counsel to call
and cross-examine witnesses; and
(5) giving the President’s counsel access to,
and the ability to respond to, the evidence
adduced by the Committee;
Whereas, by contrast, the House’s current
impeachment ‘‘inquiry’’ provides none of
these basic rights and protections to Presi-
dent Trump;
Whereas the main allegations against
President Trump are based on assertions and
testimony from witnesses whom he is unable
to confront, as part of a process in which he
is not able to offer witnesses in his defense
or have a basic understanding of the allega-
tions lodged against him;
Whereas all witness interviews that have
been conducted thus far in the House have
been behind closed doors with limited minor-
ity participation;
Whereas the House’s current impeachment
‘‘inquiry’’ ignores the procedural rights
given to the investigating committee’s mi-
nority in previous Presidential impeach-
ments, including granting equal subpoena
power to both the chair and ranking member
of the committee;
Whereas, the House is denying President
Trump the same basic pre-inquiry rights af-
forded to President Clinton;
Whereas the Whitewater Investigation in-
volved nearly five years of painstaking in-
vestigative work by a special counsel and an
independent counsel before the House even
voted to have the Judiciary Committee open
an impeachment inquiry;
Whereas President Clinton vigorously
fought that investigation, including by rais-
ing multiple privilege claims and he was per-
mitted to fully litigate those claims through
the courts;

October 24, 2019
Whereas President Trump, by contrast,
fully cooperated with Special Counsel Robert
S. Mueller’s investigation;
Whereas, during the course of the Mueller
investigation, President Trump never raised
privilege claims, he turned over more than
one million pages of documents, he directed
senior aides to testify freely, including mak-
ing the White House Counsel available to
testify for more than thirty hours, and he
agreed to answer written questions on pen-
alty of perjury; and
Whereas, rather than giving President
Trump the same due process rights that
President Clinton had to raise and litigate
claims of constitutional privilege, House In-
telligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff
has repeatedly threatened to use President
Trump’s assertion of his constitutional
rights as evidence of obstruction and to im-
peach President Trump for trying to litigate
those claims: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) calls on the House of Representatives,
prior to proceeding any further with its im-
peachment investigation into President
Trump, to vote to initiate a formal impeach-
ment inquiry;
(2) calls on the House of Representatives to
provide President Trump, like every other
American, with due process, to include the
ability to confront his accusers, call wit-
nesses on his behalf, and have a basic under-
standing of the accusations against him that
would form any basis for impeachment; and
(3) calls on the House of Representatives to
provide members of the minority with the
ability to participate fully in all proceedings
and have equal authority to issue subpoenas
and other compulsory process.

PORTING THE DESIGNATION OF
SEPTEMBER 2019 AS ‘‘NATIONAL
ALCOHOL AND DRUG ADDICTION
RECOVERY MONTH’’
Mr. KING (for himself, Mrs. CAPITO,
and Mr. MANCHIN) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to.:
S. RES. 379
Whereas the theme for National Alcohol
and Drug Addiction Recovery Month in 2019
is ‘‘Join the Voices for Recovery: Together
We Are Stronger’’;
Whereas an estimated 68,000 people in the
United States suffered a fatal overdose in
2018, with an average number of 186 fatal
overdoses per day;
Whereas there are roughly 23,000,000 people
in the United States in recovery from alco-
hol and drug addiction;
Whereas the estimated total cost to the
economy of prescription opioid misuse is
$78,500,000,000 annually, and includes the cost
of healthcare, lost productivity, and involve-
ment of the criminal justice system;
Whereas people with substance use dis-
order may face stigma from health profes-
sionals as well as friends and family;
Whereas it has been demonstrated that
stigma can be a barrier for people with sub-
stance use disorder to access treatment and
engage in recovery; and
Whereas peer-supported communities offer
people with substance use disorder better
success in recovery by addressing the per-
sonal and emotional effects of addiction and
easing reintegration: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) recognizes the importance of education
for the prevention of substance use disorder;
(2) supports efforts to explore how inte-
grated care, community, and sense of pur-
pose can lead to effective and sustainable
treatment; and
(3) shows appreciation and gratitude for
family members, friends, and other individ-
uals who support individuals in recovery.

THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFETIMES
Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. CARDIN,
Mr. ALEXANDER, Ms. HASSAN, Mr.
YOUNG, Mr. JONES, Ms. COLLINS, and
Mrs. MURRAY) submitted the following
resolution; which was considered and
agreed to:
S. RES. 380
Whereas people in the United States are
living longer and the cost of retirement is in-
creasing significantly;
Whereas Social Security remains the bed-
rock of retirement income for the great ma-
jority of the people of the United States but
was never intended by Congress to be the
sole source of retirement income for fami-
lies;
Whereas recent data from the Employee
Benefit Research Institute indicates that, in
the United States—
(1) 40.6 percent of households in which the
head of household is between the ages of 35
and 64 are likely to run out of money in re-
tirement; and
(2) the amount that workers have saved for
retirement is much less than the amount
those workers need to adequately fund their
retirement years;
Whereas the financial literacy of workers
in the United States is important so that
those workers understand the need to save
for retirement;
Whereas saving for retirement is a key
component of overall financial health and se-
curity during retirement years and the im-
portance of financial literacy in planning for
retirement must be advocated;
Whereas many workers may not—
(1) be aware of the various options in sav-
ing for retirement; or
(2) have focused on the importance of, and
need for, saving for retirement and success-
fully achieving retirement security;
Whereas, although many employees have
access through their employers to defined
benefit and defined contribution plans to as-
sist the employees in preparing for retire-
ment, many of those employees may not be
taking advantage of those plans at all or to
the full extent allowed by Federal law;
Whereas saving for retirement is necessary
even during economic downturns or market
declines, which makes continued contribu-
tions all the more important;
Whereas all workers, including public and
private sector employees, employees of tax-
exempt organizations, and self-employed in-
dividuals, can benefit from developing per-
sonal budgets and financial plans that in-
clude retirement savings strategies that
take advantage of tax-preferred retirement
savings vehicles;
Whereas effectively and sustainably with-
drawing retirement resources throughout
the retirement years of an individual is as
important and crucial as saving and accumu-
lating funds for retirement; and
Whereas the week of October 20 through
October 26, 2019, has been designated as ‘‘Na-
tional Retirement Security Week’’: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Retirement Security Week, including
raising public awareness of the importance
of saving adequately for retirement;
(2) acknowledges the need to raise public
awareness of a variety of tax-preferred re-
tirement vehicles that are used by many peo-
ple in the United States but could be used by
more; and
(3) calls on States, localities, schools, uni-
versities, nonprofit organizations, busi-
nesses, other entities, and the people of the
United States to observe National Retire-
ment Security Week with appropriate pro-
grams and activities, with the goal of in-
creasing the retirement savings and personal
financial literacy of all people in the United
States, thereby enhancing the retirement se-
curity of the people of the United States.

Whereas several hundred thousand mem-
bers of the Armed Forces rotate each year
through deployments to more than 150 coun-

Whereas more than 2,000,000 members of
the Armed Forces have deployed to the area
of operations of the United States Central
Command since the September 11, 2001, ter-
rorist attacks;
Whereas the United States is kept strong
and free by the loyal military personnel from
the total force, which is comprised of the
regular components, the National Guard, and
the Reserves, who protect the precious herit-
age of the United States through their dec-
larations and actions;
Whereas the United States remains com-
mitted to providing the fullest possible ac-
counting for personnel missing from past
conflicts ranging from World War II through
current day conflicts;
Whereas members of the Armed Forces
serving at home and abroad have coura-
geously answered the call to duty to defend
the ideals of the United States and to pre-
serve peace and freedom around the world;
Whereas the United States remains com-
mitted to easing the transition from deploy-
ment abroad to service at home for members
of the Armed Forces and the families of the

Whereas members of the Armed Forces per-
sonify the virtues of patriotism, service,

Whereas the families of members of the

cant sacrifices for the United States; and
Whereas the Senate has designated October

Whereas principals work collaboratively

pending in the Superior Court for the Dis-
trict of Columbia, the Government has sub-
poenaed for testimony Jason Covey, an em-

Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of
the United States and Rule XI of the Stand-

Whereas, when it appears that evidence

BRATING THE 30TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE FALL OF THE
BERLIN WALL, THE REUNIFICA-
TION OF BOTH GERMANY AND
EUROPE, AND THE SPREAD OF
DEMOCRACY AROUND THE
WORLD
Mr. RISCH (for himself, Mr. MENEN-
DEZ, Mr. JOHNSON, and Mrs. SHAHEEN)
submitted the following resolution;
which was referred to the Committee
on Foreign Relations:
S. RES. 385
Whereas November 9, 2019, marks the 30th
anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall,
one of the most visible symbols of com-
munism and the ‘‘Iron Curtain’’ that divided
Europe, which led to the reunification of
Germany;
Whereas, beginning with the Russian Revo-
lution of 1917, communist governments
around the world denied freedom to and per-
secuted their citizens for most of the 20th
Century, resulting in the deaths of up to
100,000,000 people;
Whereas, in the aftermath of World War II,
the Soviet Union established control over
countries in Central and Eastern Europe and
further increased its power through the foun-
dation of the Warsaw Pact military alliance
between the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary,
Poland, and Romania;
Whereas the Soviet Union blockade of West
Berlin in the summer of 1948 left West Ber-
liners with only one month’s worth of provi-
sions;
Whereas, in what became known as the
‘‘Berlin Airlift’’, the United States and
United Kingdom responded to the blockade
by airlifting 2,325,809 tons of food and sup-
plies during 277,569 total flights into West
Berlin;
Whereas the Soviet Union was forced to
lift the blockade of West Berlin on May 12,
1949, in light of the success of the Berlin Air-
lift;
Whereas the Berlin Wall, built in 1961, sep-
arated communist East Germany from demo-
cratic West Germany, dividing the German
people and symbolically dividing the world
into democratic and authoritarian spheres;
Whereas, in West Berlin in 1963, President
John F. Kennedy spoke out against the Ber-
lin Wall and communism, declaring that
‘‘[f]reedom has many difficulties and democ-
racy is not perfect, but we have never had to
put a wall up to keep our people in, to pre-
vent them from leaving us’’;
Whereas, during the 28 years of the Berlin
Wall’s existence, more than 75,000 people
were imprisoned for attempting to leave
East Germany, and more than 1,000 people
are estimated to have been killed trying to
escape;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6163
October 24, 2019
Whereas Soviet forces brutally repressed
demonstrations against repressive com-
munist governments in Hungary in 1956,
Czechoslovakia in 1968, and Poland in 1980;
Whereas the United States Congress played
a crucial role in the founding of Radio Free
Europe and Radio Liberty, independent and
uncensored news outlets that broadcast be-
hind the Iron Curtain and have been credited
by former Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and former Czech President Vaclav Havel
with playing a significant role in the ending
the Cold War;
Whereas, in West Berlin in 1987, President
Ronald Reagan, standing at the Brandenburg
Gate, symbolically referred to both the phys-
ical wall and the division of the world and
implored Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev
to ‘‘tear down this Wall!’’;
Whereas President Reagan stated, ‘‘As long
as this gate is closed, as long as this scar of
a wall is permitted to stand, it is not the
German question alone that remains open,
but the question of freedom for all man-
kind.’’;
Whereas, on August 23, 1989, several mil-
lion people across the Baltic States of Esto-
nia, Latvia, and Lithuania, which were ille-
gally annexed in 1940 by the Soviet Union,
demonstrated bravery and resilience by join-
ing hands to form a 500-kilometer long
human chain to peacefully demand their
independence;
Whereas, at midnight on November 9, 1989,
the Berlin Wall symbolically fell, and East
Berliners were allowed to cross into the
West;
Whereas, that night, East Berliners took
pickaxes to this hated symbol of oppression,
and during the following three days more
than 2,000,000 people visited West Berlin from
the East;
Whereas, on November 13, 1989, the United
States Senate welcomed ‘‘the opening of the
Berlin Wall as symbolic of the beginning of
the process of reform taking place in the
German Democratic Republic (East Ger-
many) and throughout Eastern Europe’’;
Whereas, after the fall of the Berlin Wall,
a wave of democratic governance swept the
world;
Whereas, by the summer of 1990, democrat-
ically elected governments had been formed
in all former Warsaw Pact countries;
Whereas the reunification of Germany was
officially declared on October 3, 1990;
Whereas the process of German reunifica-
tion faced significant economic, structural,
cultural, and political challenges both with-
in Germany and in Europe and took dedi-
cated political leaders and citizens, with the
support of allied nations, over a decade to
achieve;
Whereas, on December 25, 1991, the Soviet
flag was lowered from over the Kremlin for
the final time, replaced by the Russian flag;
Whereas Mr. Gorbachev later said, ‘‘The
Soviet model was defeated not only on the
economic and social levels; it was defeated
on a cultural level. Our society, our people,
the most educated, the most intellectual, re-
jected that model on the cultural level be-
cause it does not respect the man, oppresses
him spiritually and politically.’’;
Whereas, since its reunification, Germany
has become the world’s fourth largest econ-
omy, has served as a leading voice in the Eu-
ropean Union (EU), the Group of 7, and the
United Nations, and has been consistently
rated by Freedom House as one of the
world’s freest countries;
Whereas the United States and Germany
share a close and multidimensional relation-
ship, including security cooperation and an
economic and trade partnership;
Whereas the United States and Germany
share values of freedom, democracy, and
human rights and work in tandem to support
and uphold these three pillars globally;
Whereas the 30th anniversary of the fall of
the Berlin Wall coincides with the 70th anni-
versary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-
zation (NATO) and the 15th anniversary of
the European Union ‘‘Big Bang’’, when 10
mostly post-communist countries joined the
EU’s community of democracies;
Whereas many former Soviet and com-
munist countries are prospering as a result
of their democratic and economic reforms,
reflected in their memberships in the EU and
NATO; and
Whereas the fall of the Berlin Wall sig-
nified the end of the division of Europe and,
ultimately, the triumph of democracy over
communism: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) recognizes the 30th anniversary of the
fall of the Berlin Wall as the start of German
reunification and democratic change in East-
ern Europe and much of the rest of the
world;
(2) values the significant efforts made by
German and European citizens to reunify
and reinvigorate a united Germany;
(3) recognizes Germany for its steadfast al-
liance and friendship with the United States,
its leadership within the European Union, its
commitment to democracy, rule of law, and
market-based economics, and its efforts to
support these values around the world;
(4) congratulates the former communist
countries of Europe for their substantial
progress over the past 30 years towards
strengthening their democracies, protecting
human rights, combating the corruption en-
demic to communist regimes, transitioning
to market-based economies, and resolving
longstanding disputes; and
(5) reaffirms the United States commit-
ment to supporting democratic reform, and
urges these countries to continue this
progress so that their democracies and
economies can thrive and their people can
prosper.

zure or detention of an individual pursuant
to a detainer issued by the Department of

SHELBY to the bill H.R. 3055, making
appropriations for the Departments of
Commerce and Justice, Science, and
Related Agencies for the fiscal year
ending September 30, 2020, and for
other purposes; which was ordered to
lie on the table; as follows:
At the appropriate place in title II of divi-
sion D, insert the following:
SEC. 2ll. It is the sense of Congress
that—
(1) more than 17,000,000 people live in man-
ufactured homes and benefit from high-qual-
ity affordable homes which provide stability;
(2) owners of manufactured homes have
disproportionately low-income households,
and in 2013, the median annual household in-
come for living in manufactured housing was
$28,400;
(3) approximately 75 percent of manufac-
tured home households earn less than $50,000
per year;
(4) more than 10 percent of veterans in the
United States live in manufactured homes;
(5) in late 1990, manufactured housing rep-
resented 2⁄3 of the new affordable housing
produced in the United States and remains a
significant source of unsubsidized affordable
housing in the United States;
(6) in 2015, the average cost per square foot
for a new manufactured home was 48 dollars,
less than half of the cost per square foot for
a new-site built, structure-only home, which
was $101;
(7) in 2009, 43 percent of all new homes that
sold for less than $150,000 were manufactured
homes;
(8) manufactured homes account for 23 per-
cent of new home sales under $200,000;
(9) more than 50,000 manufactured home
communities, also referred to as ‘‘mobile
home parks’’, exist throughout the United
States;
(10) more than 2,900,000 manufactured
homes are placed in manufactured home
communities;
(11) manufactured home communities pro-
vide critical affordable housing, but receive
very little Federal, State, or local funds to
subsidize the cost of manufactured homes;
(12) manufactured home owners in such
communities may own the home, but they do
not own the land under the home, which
leaves the home owners vulnerable to rent
increases, arbitrary rule enforcement, and in
the case of a manufactured home community
owner converting the land to some other use,
community closure;
(13) an eviction or closure of a manufac-
tured home community is very disruptive to
a resident who may be unable to pay the
thousands of dollars it takes to move the
manufactured home or find a new location
for the manufactured home;
(14) in an effort to preserve a crucial source
of affordable housing within the past two
decades, a national network of housing pro-
viders has helped residents purchase and own
the land under the manufactured home com-
munity, and manage the manufactured home
community;
(15) nationwide, there are more than 1,000
stable, permanent ownership cooperatives or
nonprofit-owned developments in more than
a dozen States;
(16) members of manufactured home com-
munities continue to own such homes indi-
vidually, own an equal share of the land be-
neath the entire manufactured home com-
munity, participate in the governing of the
community, and elect a board of directors
who make major decisions within the manu-
factured home community by a democratic
vote;
(17) in New Hampshire, more than 30 per-
cent of manufactured home communities are
owned by residents;
(18) resident-owned cooperatives and non-
profit owned communities have also flour-
ished in Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Is-
land, Washington, Oregon, and Minnesota;
(19) nationwide, only 2 percent of all manu-
factured home communities are resident or
nonprofit-owned;
(20) when the owner of a manufactured
home community or his or her heirs sell the
community to the highest bidder, it can re-
sult in displacement for dozens and some-
times hundreds of families; and
(21) Congress should endeavor to protect
residents of manufactured home commu-
nities by encouraging the owners of those
properties to sell them to nonprofit organi-
zations or to the residents themselves to own
cooperatively.

RECOGNIZING THE 20TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE AMERICAN BUS
ASSOCIATION’S BUS INDUSTRY
SAFETY COUNCIL
HON. SAM GRAVES
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, October 24, 2019
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker,
today I wish to recognize the American Bus
Association (ABA) and its Bus Industry Safety
Council or ‘‘BISC.’’ This year BISC will be
celebrating its 20th anniversary as the only
private motorcoach safety organization in
North America. In 2000, ABA had the foresight
and dedication to establish BISC for the sole
purpose of enhancing the safety of commer-
cial passenger-carrying motor vehicle oper-
ations. Initially, the group was made up of 30
passionate and dedicated bus industry safety
directors but has since grown into a vital net-
work of highway safety advocates, including
members of the motorcoach industry, federal
and local safety oversight and enforcement of-
ficials, research entities, and international or-
ganizations. I would like to congratulate ABA
and the Bus Industry Safety Council on this
auspicious occasion and recognize BISC’s 20
years of commitment to improving bus and
motorcoach safety.
In response to the horrific events of a bus
crash that claimed 23 lives just outside New
Orleans on May 10, 1999, Mother’s Day, and
a year that saw a high-water mark of 32 mo-
torcoach passenger fatalities, ABA supported
the formation of BISC. The founding goal of
the Council was, and remains today, to contin-
ually raise the level of safety in the intercity
bus and motorcoach industry through collabo-
rative efforts with industry, government offi-
cials, and other safety professionals in a work-
shop and educational environment. To its
credit, BISC has and continues to successfully
meet this goal.
Through BISC’s education and outreach ef-
forts, onboard motorcoach passenger fatalities
have continued to decrease since its estab-
lishment, annually providing nearly 600 million
passengers with safe transportation. The BISC
has played a critical role in assisting the in-
dustry to adopt safety technology and prac-
tices. Growing from that initial core of 30
founding members, BISC now counts over 400
individuals among its membership, rep-
resenting every aspect of the motorcoach in-
dustry. BISC members provide expertise in
areas such as security, mechanical, safety,
and operational and maintenance responsibil-
ities, with leadership from across the entire
North American motorcoach industry. The
group meets regularly to discuss issues and
innovations in areas of safety, regulatory com-
pliance, mechanics, technology, and pas-
senger security, to address the transportation
safety needs not only of today but for the fu-
ture of the national transportation system.
I would like to join with ABA and the entire
motorcoach industry in saluting this safety or-
ganization. We recognize the many contribu-
tions BISC has made to highway safety and
the success in bringing the traveling public
safely to their destinations. Congratulations to
the Bus Industry Safety Council on 20 years of
dedication and commitment to bus and motor-
coach safety. Keep up the good work, as we
look forward to the next 20 years.

RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL
HON. G.K. BUTTERFIELD
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, October 24, 2019
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate the 150th anniversary
of the first college football game ever played
on November 6, 1869, and to recognize the
importance of college football in our country
today. Since the initial game 150 years ago,
more than 5.33 million Americans have played
college football and millions more have be-
come devoted fans of the game. Over the past
150 years, college football has become woven
into the fabric of our society and the lives of
countless Americans.
Many Americans have had the joy and privi-
lege to participate in college football, including
many of our nation’s greatest leaders—rep-
resenting all different backgrounds—who often
cite their experiences as college football play-
ers as critical factors in their development and
their long-term success. College football play-
ers have become U.S. Presidents, Rhodes
Scholars, actors, activists, chief executives of
major businesses, successful entrepreneurs,
academics and elected officials. The game
promotes camaraderie among players which
has translated into lifelong friendships for so
many and has grown throughout the years
with almost 80,000 student-athletes taking to
the field every fall.
In North Carolina’s First Congressional Dis-
trict, I represent a number of schools across
several divisions within the National Collegiate
Athletics Association (NCAA): the Duke Uni-
versity Blue Devils, the East Carolina Univer-
sity (ECU) Pirates, the North Carolina Central
University (NCCU) Eagles, the Chowan Uni-
versity Hawks, and the Barton College Bull-
dogs who will field a team in 2020.
College football allows us, as participants
and spectators, to put our differences aside
and celebrate a game, that in many ways, em-
bodies the spirit of what makes us great as a
country—our diversity. It brings together a di-
verse pool of participants with different back-
grounds, experiences, and creeds. On Novem-
ber 6, 2019, we celebrate college football for
the stories and memories that it has helped
create over these last 150 years.
Madam Speaker, college football is special
to so many, and I am honored to recognize
such a significant milestone and achievement
in the history of this game.
COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF
PRIVATE WILLIAM BLOUNT
HON. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, October 24, 2019
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I rise to
commemorate the life of Private William
Blount, a resident of New York’s 13th Con-
gressional district who recently passed away.
Private Blount grew up in the neighborhoods
of Manhattan and proudly answered the call of
his country, when he was drafted into the
United States Army on February 14, 1968,
and was assigned to the HHD 523rd Signal
Battalion. Private Blount was deployed to fight
in Vietnam for 11 months with his combat tour
ending on April 10, 1969.
For his 11-month deployment and combat in
Vietnam, Private Blount was awarded the Na-
tional Defensive Service Medal, Vietnam Serv-
ice Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal, Para-
chutist Badge, and for his marksmanship, a
Sharpshooter Badge for the M–14 Rifle. While
Private Blount was overseas, he was given or-
ders to join another unit. However, record of
this order and Private Blount’s transfer was
lost or unaccounted for in the midst of the
Vietnam War. Like many soldiers, Private
Blount was designated as ‘‘AWOL’’ for nearly
75 days by the U.S. Army. This inaccurate
representation of Private Blount’s service, like
many other Vietnam War veterans, is an error
both President Ford and President Carter rec-
ognized, and both submitted Amnesty of Par-
dons for Vietnam veterans under AWOL or
Deserter Status.
Private Blount’s record was never cleared
and was discharged Under Conditions Other
Than Honorable. While this design permitted
Private Blount to receive health care services
through the VA, he and his family had been
prevented from receiving many veterans’ ben-
efits while he was alive. It is with great sad-
ness that Private Blount passed away late last
month on September 29, 2019, and due to his
designation was not permitted to receive a
military burial. Private Blount’s circumstance is
not abnormal from other Vietnam veterans
whose discharge from active service on am-
biguous grounds and have been denied the
benefits and dignity they deserve.
Private Blount’s death is a reminder of the
sacrifices required to defend our country. But
to recognize Private Blount only from his pass-
ing is a diminution of his life and career fol-
lowing his active service. Private Blount was
an active member of the United States Army
Garrison Ft Hamilton’s Equal Opportunity Pro-
gram and has countless volunteer hours
logged. He received numerous Garrison Com-
mander’s Certificate of Appreciation for out-
standing service and dedication to the Equal
Opportunity Program.
Private Blount’s unwavering patriotism, in-
valuable knowledge of military tactics as a
combatant and lifelong student, and ardent
representation of combat as a tireless sacrifice

country. May he rest in peace.
