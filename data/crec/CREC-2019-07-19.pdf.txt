PRAYER
Reverend Dr. Dan C. Cummins, Cap-
itol Worship, Washington, D.C., offered
the following prayer:
Heavenly Father, in loving our neigh-
bor unconditionally is Your law ful-
filled. But if we continuously devour
one another, are we not consumed by
our lust, incapable of walking in such
love?
Yet, if we belong to Christ, those de-
vices have been crucified, because we
have received the power of Your holy
spirit, who bears witness in our life of
Your graces: love, joy, peace,
longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,
faith, meekness, temperance.
In these virtues, we must walk, re-
storing those who have been overcome
by sin.
For this purpose, Your Son ascended
to Heaven’s throne to bestow these
healing graces upon us, Your children,
allowing us to walk in the spirit, desir-
ing to love one another, heal one an-
other.
Father, we know how to give good
gifts to our children, but You promised
these greater gifts to us, these gifts of
the spirit, if we ask.
So, Father, we ask: Give us Your
spirit.
In Jesus name we pray.
Amen.

HONORING THE ORLAND FIRE
PROTECTION DISTRICT ON TWO
MILESTONES
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, July 19, 2019
Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the Orland Fire Protection District as
it celebrates 125 years of fighting fires and 50
years as an organized fire district. I am privi-
leged to recognize the Orland Fire Protection
District on this occasion.
The Orland Fire Protection District traces its
roots back to 1894, the year sewn onto the
flag of the early Volunteer Fire Department.
With 14 original members, the department op-
erated a four man, hand-pulled pumping en-
gine and a hose cart out of a wood-framed
building on Beacon Avenue that doubled as
the village hall.
In 1914, Peter J. Pitts was named Fire Mar-
shal, taking charge of the 25-member volun-
teer fire department and its $100 annual budg-
et. The Orland Fire Department would serve
the community for 75 years in total until voters
approved a referendum creating the Orland
Fire Protection District in 1969. Fire Chief Ar-
thur Granat Sr., who joined the ranks as a vol-
unteer in 1946 and was elected Fire Chief in
1957, was essential in overseeing this transi-
tion. In honor of Chief Granat’s service to the
community, the Orland Fire Protection District
Training Facility was named in his honor.
While the Orland Fire Protection District
traces its 125-year history to humble begin-
nings, it now operates a model, contemporary
service for the community and its residents.
Appointed in 1988, Fire Chief/Administrator
Robert M. Buhs played a large role in the Fire
Protection District’s modernization. Today, Fire
Chief Michael Schofield provides excellent
leadership and has established the Orland
Fire Protection District as a regional leader in
fire safety and training. The Fire Protection
District also deserves recognition for its signifi-
cant community engagement work on opioids
and other issues.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing the rich history of service
that the Orland Fire Protection District has
provided. May the selfless dedication to com-
munity of all the employees of the OFPD
serve as an example to us all.

HONORING GLENN GILLESPIE FOR
HIS 20 YEARS OF SERVICE ORGA-
NIZING THE CLINTON COUNTY
FAIR ON THE OCCASION OF HIS
RETIREMENT
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, July 19, 2019
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Glenn Gillespie for his 20 years
of service organizing the Clinton County Fair.
After 20 years and on the 71st anniversary,
this year marks the last time Glenn will be
heading the event after recently announcing
his retirement.
The Clinton County Fair has been a main-
stay of the community since 1948 with genera-
tions of North Country residents attending the
fair each year. Whether it be the rides, the
music, or the animals, the fair has something
for everybody and has been a celebration that
has bonded our communities for generations.
Thanks to Glenn’s vision and passion, the
fair has grown in attendance every year and
expanded the list of attractions. During his ten-
ure, Glenn introduced the Plattsburgh Blue-
grass Festival to the fairgrounds and brought
in booster clubs from local schools. Glenn’s
accomplishments extend statewide having
served as a representative to the state con-
vention of fairs during his tenure and serving
as-president of all state fairs in 2008. In 2016,
Glenn’s contributions were recognized when
the New York State Agricultural Fair Associa-
tion named a stage on the fairground in his
honor.
Glenn Gillespie has left a permanent mark
on the Clinton County Fair and the North
Country at large. His accomplishments have
strengthened our community and brought joy
to countless North Country residents. On be-
half of New York’s 21st Congressional District,
I want to thank Glenn and wish him and his
family the best as they move into this new
chapter in their lives.

HONORING NELSON MANDELA
HON. MAXINE WATERS
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, July 19, 2019
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor a man who absolutely put his life and
freedom on the line for a cause greater than
himself: South African President Nelson
Mandela.
Nelson Mandela was a transformative lead-
er who was imprisoned for 27 years, but rose
to become the first black President of South
Africa. He used his tenure to dismantle apart-
heid, combat institutional racism, and heal his
nation.
Nelson Mandela’s courageous leadership in-
spired my own involvement in the anti-apart-
heid movement in the United States, where I
was a national leader of the Free South Africa
Movement and TransAfrica, and fought for the
passage of my bill, Assembly Bill 134, which
forced California to divest $ 12 billion in state
pension funds tied to South Africa’s apartheid
regime.
Nelson Mandela will always be a personal
hero and a dear friend to me. I cherish the op-
portunities that I had to visit him in South Afri-
ca, and host him in the United States: first, as
the chair of a Welcome Home Celebration that
filled the Los Angeles Coliseum, and again at
a Congressional ceremony that I hosted in his
honor in the U.S. Capitol.
Today, on what would have been his 101st
birthday, let us all remember the powerful les-
son of courage, sacrifice, and service that is
the legacy of our beloved ‘‘Mandiba.’’
