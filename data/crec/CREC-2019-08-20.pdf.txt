God, who stretched the spangled
heavens, we Your children, in Your
likeness, share inventive powers with
You.
Thank You for the delightful and
awesome creation of which we are a
part. Thank You, also, for the sci-
entists of this Nation, especially those
who serve in our government. We are
sorry for the times our laziness, igno-
rance, greed, and fear have caused us to
misuse Your gifts of science and tech-

riosity, and compassion regarding the
science and technology issues before
us.
Help legislators and staff members
craft legislation, appropriate funds,
and provide oversight to support and
encourage scientific study, advance

our understanding of human societies
and bodies.
In all we learn and do, may we care
for creation, serve our neighbors, and
honor You, great creator.
Amen.

TRIBUTE TO THE WASATCH FRONT
REGIONAL COUNCIL
HON. BEN McADAMS
OF UTAH
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, I would
like to congratulate the Wasatch Front Re-
gional Council on the occasion of its 50th an-
niversary, celebrated this year on March 28,
2019.
WFRC is the Metropolitan Planning Organi-
zation for the majority of the Wasatch Front
Region in Utah. It is a collaborative body com-
prised of city and county officials, transpor-
tation agencies, and other stakeholders, who
work together to plan for the future of the Re-
gion. As a convener, WFRC works with its
partners to build consensus and enhance
quality of life by developing and implementing
visions and plans for a well-functioning multi-
modal transportation system, livable commu-
nities, a strong economy, and a healthy envi-
ronment.
The Region’s geography is unique. Bounded
east and west by mountains and lakes, the lin-
ear metropolitan area extends 100 miles north
to south, along the Wasatch Mountains. The
majority of Utah’s population lives in the Re-
gion. Since 1969, Utah’s population has grown
from just over 1 million to over 3 million today,
and it is projected to top 5 million by 2050.
This growth presents challenges, but also tre-
mendous opportunities, on which WFRC
seeks to capitalize through proactive, collabo-
rative planning and implementation.
Utah is widely referred to as the Crossroads
of the West. The multi-modal transportation
system that distinctively serves the broader
Wasatch Front Region—and the nation—found
its birth in the WFRC plans. These plans were
also fundamental in development of Utah’s
Unified Transportation Plan, the first com-
prehensive, coordinated, multimodal statewide
transportation plan in the nation, which has re-
ceived recognition as a national best practice
from the U.S. Department of Transportation
and others.
On transportation and other quality of life
issues such as land use, housing, and eco-
nomic development, WFRC and its partners
have kept an eye to the future and a coopera-
tive spirit. This has been instrumental to devel-
oping and maintaining one of the top-rated
economies and most enviable places to live,
work and play in the nation.
The Wasatch Front Regional Council is a
fine example of how collaborative efforts will
continue to shape plans looking ahead to
2050 and beyond, helping to ensure high qual-
ity of life for Utah’s current residents and gen-
erations to come.
IN HONOR OF CHIEF OF STAFF,
TIM WALSH
HON. JUAN VARGAS
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor my departing Chief of Staff, Tim
Walsh, and his years of dedication to our
country and the communities of California’s
51st Congressional District. After eight years
of service as my Chief of Staff, first at the
California State Senate and later in the United
States House of Representatives, Tim Walsh
is departing my office with a track record of
success and leaving behind an unparalleled
team reflective of his dedicated leadership.
Tim Walsh is a native of California and a
proud San Diegan. His professional experi-
ence spans the public and private sector as
the founding member of two companies at the
highest levels of public management as well
as an adjunct university professor. Coinciden-
tally, we are both Magna Cum Laude grad-
uates of the University of San Diego with
Bachelors of Arts in Political Science. Tim is
also a graduate of the inaugural class of the
Master of Arts in Peace and Justice Studies
Program of the University of San Diego, where
he was awarded a Gandhi Fellowship, as well
as a graduate of the Price School of Policy,
Planning and Development at the University of
Southern California.
As you may know, in 2016, I was named
one of the ‘‘Hardest-Working Members of Con-
gress.’’ While I am proud of that recognition,
every Member of Congress relies on a dedi-
cated team. I would not have received this
award, garnered nearly one billion dollars of
infrastructure funding for my district, or accom-
plished many other things for this wonderful
country and my district, without Tim’s dedi-
cated leadership.
If asked, Tim will share that his greatest
source of pride is his family. As the youngest
of six children in a proud Irish Catholic clan,
he credits his parents, Bill and Penny Walsh,
with providing a secure foundation leading all
his brothers and sisters to lives of great oppor-
tunity. As a new father, he is excited about the
opportunity to spend more time with his baby
girl, his remarkable wife, and the rest of their
loving family.
Madam Speaker, I would like to echo the
teachings of John Wooden who said, ‘‘It is
amazing how much can be accomplished if no
one cares who gets the credit.’’ Tim truly lives
by this motto. I am certain that Tim Walsh’s
future success will eclipse his significant past
accomplishments.
On behalf of California’s 51st Congressional
District, I would like to formally honor Tim
Walsh on his years of dedicated service to the
nation and California’s 51st Congressional
District.
GUNNERY SGT. SCOTT A.
KOPPENHAFER
HON. SCOTT R. TIPTON
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the life and service of Marine Gun-
nery Sgt. Scott A. Koppenhafer of Mancos,
Colorado. Gunnery Sgt. Koppenhafer was
killed in combat on Saturday, August 10, 2019
while serving alongside the Iraqi Security
Forces in a planned operation in northern Iraq.
Instead of pursuing a job in business fol-
lowing his degree completion at Adams State
University, Gunnery Sgt. Koppenhafer decided
to enlist in the U.S. Marine Corps. His deci-
sion to serve was made during an intense pe-
riod of war against radical terrorists who con-
tinue to threaten our nation’s liberties and
freedom. Knowing the dangers that accom-
pany serving in war, Gunnery Sgt.
Koppenhafer heroically put aside his civilian
life ambitions and instead chose to serve his
country.
As one of the world’s most lethal fighting
forces, Marines are also well-known for their
motto, Semper Fidelis, or always faithful. Gun-
nery Sgt. Koppenhafer adhered to this motto
and perhaps best exemplified it during his time
in service which spanned nearly 14 years and
three deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. He
built an impressive resume over that period
which includes two Bronze Stars, a 2018 Ma-
rine Corps Forces Special Operations Com-
mand’s Critical Skills Operator of the Year
award, honor graduate for the special oper-
ations training school, and dozens of other
prestigious military medals and decorations.
Gunnery Sgt. Koppenhafer set himself apart
from his peers by setting the example with his
remarkable record and dedication to putting
country over self.
Madam Speaker, Gunnery Sgt.
Koppenhafer’s life was taken all too soon. His
death not only impacts his brothers and sisters
in the Corps, but he also leaves behind two
children, his wife, and his parents Gerald and
Carla. Among his fellow Marines and family
members, his hometown of Mancos bears the
immense weight of his loss. With a population
the size of many high schools across the
country, the loss of one from our small com-
munity is felt by all who live there. It is with a
heavy heart that I, along with so many from
the area, say goodbye to such an upstanding
citizen and a true American hero. I send my
deepest condolences to Gunnery Sgt.
Koppenhafer’s family and pray that God’s
grace provides them with the comfort they
need to heal.

CONGRATULATING KOBY BRACK-
ENMEYER FOR HIS WIN AT THE
STATE FINALS BOYS’ TRACK
AND FIELD TOURNAMENT IN
THE 4X800 METER RELAY
HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Koby Brackemeyer, a junior from
Morrison High School, for winning the Illinois
High School Association’s Class 1A State
Finals Boys Track and Field Tournament in
the 4X800 Meter Relay. Koby and his team
finished first with a time of 7:57.85.
Koby ran the opening leg and turned in a
1:57.8 to put Morrison ahead instantly. By giv-
ing his teammates such an advantage, the
team was in an incredible position to finish
first. As a former athlete, I appreciate the for-
titude Koby displayed to achieve his dream of
being a state champion and commend him for
his athleticism and leadership. Koby is an ex-
ample of the importance of dedication and a
strong work ethic. I am elated with the pres-
ence of such young talent in our community
and to see him represent Morrison so well
throughout the state.
It is because of student leaders such as
Koby that I am especially proud to serve Illi-
nois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam
Speaker, I would like to again formally con-
gratulate Koby Brackemeyer on his Class 1A
State Finals title in Boys Track and Field.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF ROSE
MARY HANSHAW
HON. TIM RYAN
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life of Rose Mary Cicero Hanshaw,
who passed away surrounded by her loving
family on August 11, 2019, at the age of 81.
Born Aug. 12, 1937, in Warren, Rose was
the daughter of Nicholas and Carmella Nardo
Cicero. As a devoted wife, mother, grand-
mother and great-grandmother, Rose’s family
meant everything to her.
She was a licensed beautician for many
years, working for Helen Accordino’s Beauty
Salon. She later worked as a cook at her
cousin’s and godfather’s grocery store: Cic-
ero’s Market in Niles. During those years, she
built lifelong friendships with many of her co-
workers and customers.
Engaging her Italian heritage, Rose enjoyed
baking, cooking and Sunday macaroni dinners
with her entire family. She always looked for-
ward to family celebrations for birthdays and
holidays. She loved yardwork as well as work-
ing in her flower beds.
She was a graduate of Niles McKinley High
School, Class of 1956, and was a lifelong
member of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Parish
in Niles. In her younger years, she was active
at working the parish festival in the sausage
booth as well as being a part of the ladies
auxiliary group who cleaned the Church before
the celebrations of Christmas and Easter and
special events.
On June 13, 1959, Rose married the love of
her life, Marvin Hanshaw, who died June 4,
2018, and during their 58 years together, they
enjoyed the love and joy that family brought to
them.
She will be deeply missed by three sons,
Deacon Michael Hanshaw and his wife,
Stacey, of Liberty, David Hanshaw of
Lordstown and Frank Hanshaw and his wife,
Jessica, of Howland.
Her grandchildren brought much joy and
pride into Nana’s life, as she was affection-
ately known as, and she delighted in sharing
in all of the significant moments of their lives
from school sporting events to high school
graduations. They include Nick Hanshaw, Kyle
Hanshaw, Chance (Jaclyn) Hanshaw, Melissa
Hanshaw, Arianna Hanshaw and Nathaniel
Hanshaw. Great-grandchildren include Bentley
Edward Lane, Madalynne Rose Hanshaw and
Braelynn Rae Meely.
Rose is also survived by one brother, Car-
men Cicero of Garden Grove, California.
My wife Andrea and I are blessed to be
long-time friends of her son, Mike, who is the
deacon at my childhood church. I give my
deepest condolences to Rose’s family. She
will certainly be missed.

RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF
CONNIE JONES
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Connie Jones, who is retiring after 35
years of serving her community as Executive
Director of the Southwest Minority Economic
Development Association, which operates
Santa Ana’s Southwest Community Center.
Each day, Ms. Jones and the Southwest
Community Center carry out their mission of
‘‘helping people help themselves.’’ The South-
west Community Center serves as a vital life
line to single mothers, seniors, veterans, re-
covering addicts, the disabled, the homeless,
those who suffer from mental illness, as well
as neighborhood families and children.
Under Ms. Jones’ direction, her dedicated
staff and volunteers serve 10,000 meals a
month, distribute food baskets, clothing, pro-
vide health screenings, rental and utility assist-
ance, transportation vouchers, job referrals,
and much more. The Center has also created
an environment that fosters friendship and a
sense of belonging.
Ms. Jones, a Santa Ana native, has worked
tirelessly to continue the vision started by her
grandmother, the late Annie Mae Tripp, who
began serving meals in her garage to home-
less men, while struggling to make ends meet
as a domestic worker with seven children.
From that starting point in 1970, her ministry
for the poor and homeless expanded to a
rented building that—with the help of other
dedicated neighborhood women, area church-
es, community and business sponsors, and
hundreds of volunteers—went from serving
soup and bread to 12 homeless men to pro-
viding a life-saving services for thousands in
need.
Even a devastating fire in 2009 did not stop
the success of the Southwest Community
Center. Like a phoenix rising from the ashes,
the Center continued operations in rented fa-
cilities until a beautiful new building opened
two years later.
The new Center was built nearly for free by
contractors who wanted to give back to their
community. One of those contractors grew up
in the neighborhood served by the Southwest
Community Center. The Center’s services and
caring atmosphere helped him thrive and suc-
ceed, which is also true for hundreds of other
men, women, and children from this Santa
Ana neighborhood.
Ms. Jones’ receipt of the ‘‘Lifetime Achieve-
ment Award’’ from the Community Action Part-
nership of Orange County is a true testament
to her spirit and love for the Santa Ana com-
munity. It is my distinct honor to recognize my

HONORING DR. WILLARD
LEWALLEN
HON. JIMMY PANETTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the retiring Superintendent-President
of Hartnell Community College District, Dr.
Willard Lewallen, for his career in higher edu-
cation and commitment to serving the people
of the central coast of California. His leader-
ship has touched the lives of many, and I am
honored to acknowledge his legacy today in
the House of Representatives.
Throughout his seven years in his role as
Superintendent-President, Dr. Lewallen has
remained committed to a philosophy of ‘‘stu-
dents first.’’ He has set an inspiring example
for Hartnell College employees and its sup-
porters, leading initiatives and partnerships
that have yielded tremendous success and
strengthened Hartnell and the entire Salinas
Valley. The continual growth and development
of the college itself is due in large part to Dr.
Lewallen’s investment of time and expertise
into improvement of campus programs and fa-
cilities. Dr. Lewallen’s record of service to
Hartnell and the Salinas Valley has certainly
left a lasting impact on the City of Salinas and
the Monterey Peninsula.
Student success has been a priority of Dr.
Lewallen throughout his time at Hartnell and is
reflected by an overwhelming increase in com-
pletion of degrees and certificates. The num-
ber of students pursuing four-year degrees
has also risen during Dr. Lewallen’s tenure,
preparing these students to transfer to the
California State University and University of
California systems to complete their degrees.
Dr. Lewallen has left an indelible mark on
the central coast with Hartnell’s recently devel-
oped partnerships with California State Univer-
sity, Monterey Bay (CSUMB) and Salinas Val-
ley Memorial Healthcare System. Dr. Lewallen
helped initiate programs like the CSin3 pro-
gram, which allows students to complete a
B.S. in computer science in three years, and
the Teacher Transfer Pathway program, which
enables students to begin at Hartnell and con-
tinue seamlessly at CSUMB and earn a teach-
ing certificate within five years.
Growth and development have been re-
markable under the leadership of Dr. Lewallen

and has impacted faculty and staff in construc-
tive ways. The steady increase in the number
of employees and full-time faculty and has
been paired with substantial investments
made in future construction sites within the
Hartnell College system. Dr. Lewallen has
helped to secure funding for the construction
of new Hartnell education outreach centers in
Soledad and Castroville, a state-of-the-art
nursing and health sciences building on the
Main Campus in Salinas. He has also over-
seen efforts to refurbish classroom buildings
on the Main Campus and the transformation of
the Central Plaza.
As Dr. Lewallen celebrates his retirement, I
am proud to commend him on his invaluable
work as a higher education leader. On behalf
of residents across the Central Coast, I ask
my colleagues to join me in thanking Dr. Wil-
lard Lewallen for his service and wishing him
a long and healthy retirement.

HONORING FLOYD ‘‘SKIP’’ BRANCH,
JR.
HON. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in great sadness to share the passing of
Floyd ‘‘Skip’’ Branch, Jr. and honor his life and
legacy.
For generations of children, Skip, as he was
known to the community, was a fixture of their
daily lives.
In 1995, Skip founded the NYC Bombsquad
Basketball Classic, where he worked each
summer with nearly 300 young boys and girls.
But his impact was not merely honing basket-
ball skills, although he certainly did. On the
court and off the court, his lessons tran-
scended basketball and made better the lives
he touched and the community he loved.
Skip displayed an unyielding love for his
community and inimitable belief that basketball
was a constructive tool for the development
and enrichment of children and adolescents.
Responsibility. Teamwork. Academic achieve-
ment. Community engagement. Fraternity. So-
rority. These are the tenets that Skip incul-
cated in every one of his students and will re-
main a part of his indelible legacy.
His program grew and had such an impact
on young people’s lives that many of them re-
turned to teach and coach new participants.
Skip believed that basketball and the funda-
mental lessons he taught should not only be
shared with his students at Rice High School,
Cardinal Hayes, or Hostos Community Col-
lege. He also used the playground at East
100th Street and Third Avenue as a haven for
youth in East Harlem where he instilled the
fundamentals of teamwork, sportsmanship and
respect in his students. Anyone who knew
Skip knows he loved every moment spent
doing this important work.
Floyd ‘‘Skip’’ Branch, Jr. was a beloved hus-
band, brother, father, and grandfather. To his
wife Carole, son Floyd III, brother Dr. Kent
Branch, and all those close to Skip, I share
my sincerest condolences in this time of grief
and hope they find solace in knowing his leg-
acy lives on in the many young lives he im-
pacted.
HONORING THE MARTINEZ ARTS
ASSOCIATION
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Mar-
tinez Arts Association for its dedication to pro-
moting the arts in our community and to cele-
brate its 50th annual Arts in the Park Festival,
an event to support local art teachers and
Martinez students who study art in college.
The Martinez Arts Association is a 501(c)3
nonprofit that provides opportunities to local
artists and fosters arts education in Martinez
schools.
Founded in 1968, the Martinez Arts Asso-
ciation has a long history of supporting local
artists and creativity in our community. The or-
ganization is led by a volunteer board of direc-
tors who are dedicated to increasing accessi-
bility to the arts. The Martinez Arts Association
is backed financially by Association members
and generous local sponsors who are invested
in cultivating the arts in Martinez.
The Arts in the Park festival draws a larger
crowd with each passing year. This year there
are over sixty vendors, live music, activities,
and a silent auction to spark people’s imagina-
tions and enable them to give back to our
community. The Martinez Arts Association
puts on other incredible events including the
SWAN (Support Women Artists Now) Day
Celebration, participates in local parades, and
contributes rotating art exhibits at the library.
Every year, the Martinez Arts Association
awards $3,000 grants to Martinez elementary
and high school teachers to help offset budget
cuts to arts education. In addition, the organi-
zation runs a scholarship program that awards
over $3,000 each year to local high school
seniors who intend to study visual arts in col-
lege.
Madam Speaker, the Martinez Arts Associa-
tion has been an ardent advocate of the arts
in our community since 1968. It is therefore fit-
ting and proper that we honor the Martinez
Arts Association here today.

HONORING SANTA ANA VALLEY
HIGH SCHOOL
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Santa Ana Valley High School in
Santa Ana, California for their 60 years of
dedicated service to high school students in
our local community.
Founded in 1959, amid Orange County’s
population boom, Santa Ana Valley High
School was the second high school opened in
the City of Santa Ana. In its first year of oper-
ation, it served only grades 10 and 11. Now,
Santa Ana Valley High School prepares stu-
dents in grades 9–12 with the skills necessary
to meet the career and academic challenges
of our 21st century global society.
Graduates of Santa Ana Valley High School
over the past several decades have gone on
to successful careers in a variety of careers,
including professional sports, music, entrepre-
neurship, medicine, and more.
Today, Santa Ana Valley High School edu-
cates over 2,200 students and boasts a 90
percent 4-year graduation rate, which is above
the California state average. Students from
this year’s graduating class will be attending
elite institutions such as Stanford University,
Georgetown University, UC Berkeley, among
many others, which is a testament to Santa
Ana Valley High School’s growth and ad-
vancement over the past 60 years.
Santa Ana Valley High School always seeks
to innovate student service and preparation for
college and the workforce. One notable exam-
ple of this is High School Inc., a non-profit or-
ganization housed at Santa Ana Valley High
School that has helped their students secure
hundreds of internships, earn over 400 certifi-
cations, and attend dozens of industry relevant
competitions. This unique college and career
readiness that started at Santa Ana Valley
High School has now become an emerging
mode for schools nationwide.
Santa Ana Valley High School has also de-
veloped successful extracurricular programs to
support a variety of student interests in be-
coming more well-rounded individuals. Addi-
tionally, Santa Ana Valley High School has nu-
merous incredibly successful athletics pro-
grams, winning several CIF championships of
various sports over the years.
Santa Ana Valley High School has made
countless achievements over the past 60
years, and they are on track for even more
success in the future. For this reason, I ask
my colleagues to join me in honoring and rec-
ognizing the accomplishments and service of
Santa Ana Valley High School.

Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Kyle Kruhtoff, a senior from Erie-
Prophetstown High School, who won the Illi-
nois High School Association’s Class 1A State
Finals Boys Track and Field Tournament in
Pole Vaulting. Kyle set the Class 1A record at

16 feet 3 inches held by two others.
Kyle is a record-setter with the talent to go
even further in the athletic world. He broke

a former athlete, I appreciate the fortitude Kyle
displayed to achieve his dream of being a
state champion and commend him for his de-
termination and passion. Kyle is an example
of the importance of dedication and a strong
work ethic. I am delighted to see such young
talent in our community and to see him rep-
resent Erie-Prophetstown so well throughout
the state.
It is because of student leaders such as
Kyle that I am especially proud to serve Illi-
nois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam
Speaker, I would like to again formally con-
gratulate Kyle Kruhtoff on his Class 1A State
Finals title in Boys Track and Field.

IN RECOGNITION OF SUE MOORE
FOR A DISTINGUISHED CAREER
WITH THE BELLEVILLE POLICE
DEPARTMENT
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Sue Moore on her retire-
ment and recognize her thirty-two years of dis-
tinguished service in the Belleville Police De-
partment. Her contributions to the community
are worthy of commendation.
Sue Moore has been an important member
of the Belleville Police Department since 1987.
Serving as the Police Department Records
Clerk, Moore has been responsible for a host
of duties that are necessary for a police de-
partment to function effortlessly. For over
three decades, Moore has kept a watchful eye
on budgets, handled all department billings,
scheduled officers’ enrollment in various train-
ing and schools, and prepared and edited an
innumerable amount of warrants, among other
tasks. Throughout her tenure, Moore has
served under five police chiefs and worked
tirelessly with the prosecutor’s office, state offi-
cials, and numerous other individuals.
Sue Moore is known for her high degree of
professionalism, kind demeanor, and passion
for helping all she encountered. Over these
thirty-two years, Moore has become a pillar of
the Belleville Police Department and will al-
ways be remembered for her outstanding job
performance. Through her work, Moore has
truly demonstrated a commitment to the entire
Belleville community, and it is my honor and
privilege to recognize her great dedication
today.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring Sue Moore for her thirty-two
years of service to the Belleville Police Depart-
ment and congratulate her on completing her
final day with the department on June 28,
2019. We thank her for her outstanding work
and wish her the best of luck in her future en-
deavors.

HONORING SERGEANT FIRST
CLASS THOMAS F. VAUGHNS
AND THE TUSKEGEE AIRMEN
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN
OF ARKANSAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Sergeant First Class Thom-
as F. Vaughns, a Tuskegee Airman and World
War II and Korean War Veteran. On August
21, 2019, Sergeant First Class (SFC) Vaughns
will be recognized for his service and commit-
ment to the United States.
SFC Vaughns, of White Hall and resident of
the Fourth District of Arkansas, began his
service during World War II at Camp Robin-
son, North Little Rock, Arkansas. After Basic
Combat Training in California, he reported to
several locations around the country where he
worked as a mechanic on B–25 bombers. He
eventually ended up at the air base in
Tuskegee, Alabama, where he helped ensure
B–25s were operational and safe for training.
At the end of the war, he completed high
school in St. Louis and then returned to Ar-
kansas where he attended the Arkansas Agri-
cultural, Mechanical and Normal College
(AM&N), now the University of Arkansas at
Pine Bluff (UAPB). He graduated in 1950, just
in time to be called up again for service during
the Korean War. In 1951, now SFC Vaughns,
served as a supply sergeant at Fort Hood,
Texas. The Army discharged him at his re-
quest one year later in 1952.
After his military service, he worked several
different jobs but ended his career as a horti-
culture specialist at UAPB.
The Tuskegee Airmen were a highly trained
and specialized group of America’s first Afri-
can American pilots and ground crews for the
U.S. Army Air Corp and eventually the Army
Air Forces. Their impressive performance dur-
ing war-time earned them more than 150 Dis-
tinguished Flying Crosses. The unit obtained a
distinguished reputation for their ability to safe-
ly escort American bombers into enemy terri-
tory, resulting in the fewest loses in the 15th
Air Force during the war.
I am honored to recognize Sergeant First
Class Thomas F. Vaughns and the Tuskegee
Airmen for their rich history of service and
bravery. I thank each and every one of them
for protecting the freedoms of this country and
hope their legacy continues for generations to
come.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF THE
HONORABLE PATRICK JOSEPH
UNGARO
HON. TIM RYAN
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life of former Youngstown, Ohio
mayor, the Honorable Patrick Joseph Ungaro,
who passed away peacefully at his home with
his family at his side, on Saturday, August 17,
2019.
Patrick was born March 3, 1941, in Youngs-
town, to Victor and Mary (Mast) Ungaro and
grew up in the Smokey Hollow neighborhood
of Youngstown.
He graduated from The Rayen School in
1959 and attended Youngstown College,
where he played football and eventually
earned a bachelor’s degree in Education. He
received his master’s degree in Counseling,
Administration and Superintendent Certifi-
cation from Westminster College and served
in the U.S. Army during the Berlin Crisis.
Pat began his professional career in 1965
as a teacher and school counselor at The
Rayen School where he would also coach
football and track and field. Pat was eventually
named the head football coach at Rayen,
leading some of the most successful teams in
Rayen history. He then left Rayen and coach-
ing to become the Assistant Principal at South
High School until 1984. It was during these
years spent in education that Pat had the
most pleasure and reward, helping countless
kids from Youngstown reach their potential
and go on to become productive people. Many
of his former students still approach his family
crediting his calm, compassionate demeanor,
firm discipline and most of all his genuine care
for them as people as credit for their success
to this day.
Pat ran for Youngstown City Council in 1976
at the urging and support of his wife to make
a difference in the Third Ward. He was elected
and eventually became Council President the
following year, serving in that capacity until
1982. In 1983, Pat ran for Mayor of Youngs-
town, during turbulent times and won the first
of five terms, serving as mayor for 14 years.
He often credited his win to walking door to
door every day during the election in the city;
always remembering the number of great peo-
ple he had the opportunity to meet; people
who would help him become elected and who
he would eventually serve with humility and in-
tegrity. He often said that hard work, persever-
ance and being honest in your dealing with
people will always pay off. This working-class
ethos carried him to three additional terms as
mayor, where he eventually retired 1997, serv-
ing as the longest tenured mayor in the history
of the city.
Pat attempted retirement unsuccessfully and
eventually returned to education, serving as
the Assistant Principal at Youngstown City
West Elementary in 2001. In 2002, he was ap-
proached by Liberty Township to become the
Township Administrator, where he served until
June of this year. Pat made many friends in
Liberty Township and Trumbull County and
was always grateful for the opportunity to
serve Liberty until his final days.
Pat was a loving husband, father and grand-
father who cherished his family and enjoyed
many fun vacations to Ocean City, Maryland
for 40 years. Pat’s son, Eric, continues his
family’s commitment to public service as a
township trustee.
The Honorable Pat Mayor Ungaro was one
of the greatest leaders to ever come out of our
community. He began the effort to revitalize
Youngstown’s downtown, reclaimed Brownfield
sites, and was a stand tough opponent of or-
ganized crime. He made it a point to meet
with me days after I was first elected to Con-
gress. The positive things happening in
Youngstown today are because Pat Ungaro
had the guts to lead. I join the entire
Mahoning Valley in celebrating his life and leg-
acy. He will be missed.

HONORING BRIGADIER GENERAL

HON. JENNIFFER GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN
OF PUERTO RICO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN of Puerto Rico.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to recognize
Brigadier General Dustin A. Shultz of the 1st
Mission Support Command in the Caribbean
Army Reserve. Brig. General Shultz arrived in
my Congressional district of Puerto Rico days
before Hurricane Irma hit the Island on Sep-
tember of 2017. Since then, she has served
tirelessly over the last two years, where she
consolidated 5,000 Army reserves soldiers
from around the Caribbean to become a
united front. She quickly adapted and inte-
grated herself seamlessly with the locals and
led recovery efforts that were vital in our
greatest moment of need.
Since the beginning of her career in 1989,
she has served as the Headquarters Company
Commander of the 647th Area Support Group,
as an Intelligence Analyst for JTF–N, and in
2007 became the Executive Officer of the
373rd MI Battalion under the 201st MI Brigade
and just three years later, assumed command
of the Battalion. She then served as a Joint
Planner in the J9, supporting Haiti relief ef-
forts. Finally, in 2017, she was promoted to
Brigadier General and was appointed to Puer-
to Rico. Under her exemplary leadership, the
1st Mission Support Command was activated
full time in Puerto Rico for the first time and
has been carrying out relief efforts since.
Throughout her career, Brig. General Shultz
has been highly decorated with the Legion of
Merit, the Bronze Star, the Joint Service Com-
mendation Medal, the Meritorious Service
Medal, and the General Douglas MacArthur
leadership award among many others.
Her command in Puerto Rico ends this Au-
gust after 2 years of hard work and dedication.
She will move on to become the Operations
and Training Officer for the Army Reserve
Command. As the sole representative from
Puerto Rico, I thank her tremendously for all
she has done and wish her much success in
her next command.

Donville James, Lizbeth Jaquez-Mena,

Murray, Natalia Ocampo, Pedro Ocampo,
Noemi Padilla, Alex Palomar, Aliyah Plummer,
Lori Ruiz, and Kaitlyn Torres for their admit-
tance into the Waukegan to College (W2C)
program.
A year-round college readiness service,
W2C launched in 2009 and seeks to advance
local students’ intellectual and emotional de-
velopment, cultivating a strong commitment to
community and a profound belief that they can
build a brighter future for themselves, their
families and their communities. By establishing
high academic expectations and counseling
students and their families on the college ap-
plication process, W2C helps students realize
their full potential by making the dream of col-
lege a reality.
All of these students will be the first in their
families to attend college, and were selected
for the W2C program due to both their impres-
sive academic achievements as well as their
contributions to their communities. As leaders
inside and outside the classroom, these stu-
dents show tremendous dedication and poten-
tial.
Strengthening our communities requires re-
building the ladders of opportunity so that all
Americans have the opportunity to succeed
and thrive. This begins with providing each
and every child, regardless of zip code, ac-
cess to a high quality, affordable education
and continues by ensuring all families can af-
ford to send their sons and daughters to col-
lege.
When our nation’s talented young people
pursue their passions and follow their dreams,
they accomplish far more than personal
growth. They serve as role models in their
communities and their achievements inspire
and motivate other young people to equally
strive and achieve. These students truly are
Champions of Change. I wish them the very
best of luck in their higher education and in all
their future endeavors.

COMMEMORATING THE ONE HUN-
DREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF
CUMMINS INC.
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to
commemorate the one hundredth anniversary
of Cummins Inc.
In 1919, Clessie Cummins and his business
partner, William G. Irwin, joined together to
form the Cummins Engine Company, devel-
oping diesel engines. From these humble be-
ginnings, the Cummins Engine Company has
grown to become Cummins Inc., a leader
among independent engine manufacturers
producing a wide variety of engines and en-
gine system components. Today Cummins is
listed as a Fortune 150 company, employing
more than 62,000 people worldwide.
While their headquarters may be located in
Columbus, Indiana, Cummins Inc. has a long
history with Jamestown, New York. In 1974,
Cummins acquired a more than one million
square foot facility in Jamestown to manufac-
ture engine components. Since the James-
town Engine Plant produced its first engine in
1981 it has built more than two million en-
gines. The engines made in Jamestown serve
customers around the world and the plant
serves an important role in the company by
serving a wide variety of markets. The James-
town Engine Plant is also dedicated to improv-
ing the community around them, annually con-
tributing one million dollars through charitable
donations. It is a pleasure to recognize the
success of Cummins and celebrate the con-
tributions that the Jamestown Engine Plant
has made to our communities over the last
forty-five years.
One hundred years of successful business
and forty-five years of serving the community
is certainly a cause for celebration. I congratu-
late Cummins Inc. on this impressive mile-
stone and look forward to their continued suc-
cess in the years to come.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
commemorate the one hundredth anniversary
of Cummins Inc.

ers. Members of Toastmasters, both past and
present, have used their skills and experi-
ences from the organization and applied them
to careers in politics, teaching, and more.
Notably, one member placed in the top
three at the World Championship Competition
of Public Speaking, surpassing over 30,000
competitors. Furthermore, the member was in-
vited to speak at a TEDx event as well as in
various countries throughout Europe, the Mid-
dle East, and Asia. They believe that although
there are many types of speeches, if you can
master one, you can master them all. Toast-
masters provides the tools and valuable expe-
rience to practice and master skills such as
speaking on a global platform. Through the
experience, members are better equipped to
achieve their goals.
I ask my colleagues to join me in com-
mending the Toastmasters Founder’s District
for its dedication to our local community and
in honoring its 75 years of achievements and
innovation in communication and leadership
skills.

TRIBUTE TO CAROL S. LARSON
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor and celebrate the career of Carol S.
Larson, President and CEO of the David and
Lucile Packard Foundation, who is retiring at
the end of 2019 after 30 years with the Pack-
ard Foundation and 15 years serving as its
President and CEO. Carol’s dedication to
helping children and families in California, the
United States, and around the world has im-
proved countless lives and made immeas-
urable contributions to the field of philan-
thropy.
A graduate of Stanford University and Yale
Law School, Carol joined the Packard Founda-
tion in 1989 and assumed the role of Director
of Research and Grants, Law and Public Pol-
icy at the then-titled Center for the Future of
Children where she focused her grantmaking
on child health and welfare issues. She edited
and contributed to the journal publication The
Future of Children on topics ranging from
drug-exposed infants, to school-linked serv-
ices, to home visiting, to juvenile courts, and
taught two courses at Stanford Law School on
child abuse and neglect.
Carol became President and CEO of the
Packard Foundation in 2004. Under her lead-
ership, the Foundation averaged $300 million
in annual grantmaking and deployed $500 mil-
lion in total mission investments to hundreds
of partners, ranging from community-based or-
ganizations around the world to renowned in-
stitutions in the Bay Area. During Carol’s ten-
ure, the Foundation also provided $349 million
in funding to organizations and efforts working
to improve the health and well-being of chil-
dren through the Packard Foundation’s Chil-
dren, Families, and Communities program.
This funding has helped increase health care
coverage for uninsured children; enrolled more
children in preschool and introduced a new
Transitional Kindergarten for four-year-olds;
improved pediatric and obstetric care through
the world-renowned Lucile Packard Children’s
Hospital at Stanford University; strengthened
the quality of early childhood programs; and
ushered in a new understanding that the well-
being of children must be viewed through the
lens of the whole family. The Packard Founda-
tion’s integration of two-generation strategies
that seek better outcomes for parents and chil-
dren together into its work promoting the well-
being of children has shaped how philan-
thropy, policymakers, and advocates act on
behalf of families.
Under Carol’s tenure, the Packard Founda-
tion has also reinforced the Packard family’s
strong commitment to Northern California.
Since 2008, the Foundation has devoted over
$156 million through its Local Grantmaking
program to organizations committed to in-
creasing opportunities for families and commu-
nities in the Bay Area, raising the bar for other
Silicon Valley philanthropists to support local
organizations.
In recognition of her work and her contribu-
tions to the field of philanthropy, Carol re-
ceived the Council on Foundation’s Distin-
guished Service Award in 2016; the American
Leadership Forum—Silicon Valley’s 2019 John
W. Gardner Award; and the World Affairs
2019 Global Citizenship Award for her leader-
ship and dedication to the public good.
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of
Representatives to join me in congratulating
Carol S. Larson on her extraordinary career
and expressing our deepest appreciation to
her for dedicating her life to improving the
lives of children and families, and strength-
ening our county immeasurably.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE GOLD
MEDAL CONGRESSIONAL AWARD
ACHIEVED BY MR. TREVOR REY
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate Mr. Trevor Rey’s ac-
complishment in receiving the Gold Medal
Congressional Award, Congress’s highest
honor for the youth of our country. In attaining
this award, Mr. Rey demonstrated his commit-
ment to succeed in both his academic endeav-
ors and athletic events. Such an achievement
could not have been done without the support
and dedication of his family and community. I
am honored and proud to represent the exem-
plary work of young people like Trevor Rey in
Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District.
The Congressional Gold Medal Award re-
quires much from those who seek to attain it,
including a tenacity and drive that few pos-
sess. The Congressional Award was originally
created in 1979 in an effort to recognize initia-
tive, service, and achievement in young peo-
ple. In order to receive such a prestigious
award, applicants must complete a wide array
of assignments, including at least 400 hours of
voluntary public service, 200 hours of personal
development and physical fitness, and a 5-day
expedition. In order to complete his 400 hours
of public service, Mr. Rey split his time among
several community organizations. First, he
served as a troop guide for his local Boy
Scout Troop, Troop No. 46, on their trip to the
Philmont Scout Camp, where they worked to
earn merit badges and learn how to be good
scouts. Mr. Rey also volunteered at his
church, the Red Bridge United Methodist
Church, and at his high school, Center High
School in Kansas City. In addition, Mr. Rey
serves in the United States Naval Sea Cadet
Corps where he developed an appreciation for
our country’s rich naval history and helped
senior citizens affected by Hurricane Harvey in
Houston, Texas by cleaning debris and paint-
ing houses. Mr. Rey also set physical goals in
order to become a better wrestler for his high
school. In order to fulfill this goal, Mr. Rey at-
tended a wrestling camp to learn advanced
wrestling skills and improve his endurance and
strength. Through his commitment, Mr. Rey
demonstrated what it means to work for the
betterment of your community and achieve
personal growth in the process. Mr. Rey and
his fellow recipients continue the great legacy
of those receiving the Congressional Award.
Madam Speaker, please join me and all of
Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District in con-
gratulating Mr. Trevor Rey for receiving the
Gold Medal Congressional Award. I encourage
my fellow citizens to follow the example of Mr.
Rey and the rest of the Congressional Award
recipients and commit ourselves not only to
personal improvement, but to the improvement
of our communities as well.

CONGRATULATING HUNTER NEW-
MAN FOR HIS WIN AT THE
STATE FINALS BOYS’ TRACK
AND FIELD TOURNAMENT IN
THE 4X800 METER RELAY
HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Hunter Newman, a freshman
from Morrison High School, who won the Illi-
nois High School Association’s Class 1A State
Finals Boys’ Track and Field Tournament in
the 4x800 Meter Relay. Hunter and his team
finished first with a time of 7:57.85.
Hunter and his teammates easily overcame
the second-place team for their win at state.
As a former athlete, I appreciate the fortitude
Hunter displayed to achieve his dream of
being a state champion and commend him for
his efforts and attitude. Hunter is an example
of the importance of dedication and a strong
work ethic. I am proud to see him represent
Morrison so well throughout the state with his
talent and passion.
It is because of student leaders such as
Hunter that I am especially proud to serve Illi-
nois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam
Speaker, I would like to again formally con-
gratulate Hunter Newman on his Class 1A
State Finals title in Boys’ Track and Field.

IN RECOGNITION OF SHERIFF
STEVE F. DEMPSEY
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of Sheriff Steve Dempsey
from King George. Steve’s service to his com-
munity goes without question, and I believe he
is worthy of recognition.
Sheriff Dempsey’s extensive training in-
cluded both the Metropolitan Police Academy
in Washington, D.C. where he was K–9 cer-
tified and the FBI Academy where he was
able to learn countless hours of information on
how to handle increasingly difficult situations
ranging from terrorism to financial crime.
Sheriff Dempsey, along with his wife
Charlene and their family, comes from a long
line of public servants—as is evident in Sheriff
Dempsey’s commitment to his community.
Steve was in the Virginia National Guard and
served until 1978. He has been with the King
George County Police Department for 39
years, serving as both an officer and a men-
tor. He was the first K–9 officer in the county
and served as a patrol deputy for 7 years.
And, on top of all this, he has taught for al-
most 20 years at the regional academy; pass-
ing on vital experience and lessons to mem-
bers of law enforcement who benefit from his
teachings.
Not stopping there, he served as the Spe-
cial Olympics Chair for the Commonwealth
from 2017 to 2018 and is currently serving as
President of the Virginia Sheriff’s Association.
I am filled with pride to know all the good that
this man has done for his community and our
district.
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in
recognizing the accomplishments, hard work,
and dedication of Sheriff Dempsey. Words
alone cannot express our pride, and I am
proud to represent him. May God bless him
and his family.

RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF
JOHN SCRIBNER
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the extraordinary contributions of Mr.
John Scribner and his well-deserved retire-
ment. Through his leadership and devoted-
ness, he has influenced and dedicated a life-
time service to the people of California.
In the 1970s, Mr. Scribner began his public
service career to better the lives of Califor-
nians. Mr. Scribner has dedicated his life’s ca-
reer to leading and assisting Elected Officials.
In 1980, as a young professional he assisted
in various assembly campaigns throughout the
State of California. By 1992, Mr. Scribner suc-
cessfully ran for office in the Sacramento
County Board of Education. A few years later,
in 1997 Mr. John Scribner worked under
Freshman Assemblymember Scott Wildman,
catering to the needs of our fellow Califor-
nians. In 1999, I had the honor to work along-
side Mr. Scribner as he became Capitol Direc-
tor to my Sacramento office. His passion and
enthusiasm reflected in his work for the con-
stituents of my district.
In 2006, Mr. Scribner became Political Di-
rector in my Capitol office, where he continued
to fight for the welfare of Californians. He fo-
cused on various issues including infrastruc-
ture and addressing school bullying.
Mr. Scribner continues to believe that when
ordinary people come together to work to-
wards a common goal, they can make the
world a better place. He demonstrates tremen-
dous leadership and serves as a great exam-
ple and inspiration for many. He empowers
others to give back to their communities and
inspires others to choose the path of public
service.
Today we celebrate Mr. Scribner’s well-de-
served retirement and wish him many more
years of success. For these reasons, I ask my
colleagues to join me in honoring Mr. John
Scribner’s civil service career to the State of
California.

RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF KRUTA’S BAKERY
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the 100th anniversary of Kruta’s
Bakery, a family-run business that has be-
come an iconic institution in my hometown of
Collinsville, IL.
In 1919, Russian immigrant Frank Kruta,
Sr., saw an opportunity around the expanding
meat-packing industry in East St. Louis, IL,
and started a bakery on 8th Street in the city.
Numerous fellow natives of eastern Europe
flocked to the business, and it grew, as did
Frank’s family, many of whom would work at
the bakery. Frank Kruta, Jr., eventually took
over from his father, then was succeeded by
his son, Jim.
Kruta’s Bakery relocated a few miles east to
Collinsville in 1974. It has come to be known
for its signature Stollen pastries, breads, Dan-
ish rolls, and cakes for special occasions,
such as marriages, baptisms, confirmations,
and birthdays. I just enjoyed one of its cakes
in honor of my father’s 91st birthday and my
nephew’s return from overseas military serv-
ice.
A number of recipes brought from eastern
Europe by Frank Kruta, Sr., are still used to
this day by the bakery, now under a fourth
generation of the family, led by Paul Kruta,
son of Jim and his wife, Mary. Although tech-
nically retired, Jim still joins Mary in helping
out Paul and the many other family members
and employees who are involved in the still-
thriving business.
In honor of Kruta’s 100-year milestone, the
city of Collinsville closed St. Louis Road in
front of the bakery on August 18 for a celebra-
tion, which included music, artists, magicians,
and—of course—free bakery items. Money
was raised for the American Warrior Initiative.
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to congratu-
late Kruta’s Bakery for a century of excellence,
and I send my best wishes for another 100
years or more.

HONORING THE RECIPIENTS OF
THE CONGRESSIONAL VETERAN
COMMENDATION
HON. ADAM KINZINGER
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the 2019 recipients of the
Congressional Veteran Commendation in the
16th District of Illinois.
The five veterans receiving this commenda-
tion have served this country honorably and
fought for the freedoms we hold dearly. These
veterans answered their country’s call by join-
ing the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, and U.S.
Marines. As a fellow veteran, I thank them for
their patriotism and sacrifices on behalf of our
nation.
After these veterans served their country,
they came home to serve their communities.
They are civic leaders, active citizens, and
many continue to serve their military brothers
and sisters through veteran service organiza-
tions. Although their mission has changed
since returning to civilian life, their leadership
and tenacity have not.
The recipients of the 2019 Congressional
Veteran Commendation are: SGT Thomas
Cleland of Roscoe, IL; CPL Neil Dreier of
Durand, IL; 1LT Stephen Koppenhoefer (USA)
of Seneca, IL; A1C Leo McCauley of McNabb,
IL; and SMSGT Edward Stash of Ottawa, IL.
I am proud and honored to be able to rec-
ognize these notable veterans. The recipients
of this commendation serve as the embodi-
ment of both military and civil service, and it
is my hope they will inspire the next genera-
tion of our Nation’s leaders.

RECOGNIZING HAMILTON CHAPEL
BAPTIST CHURCH ON THEIR
105TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. VAN TAYLOR
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 20, 2019
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, in 1914,
Hamilton Chapel Baptist Church was estab-
lished as Frisco, Texas’ first African American
church. Pastored by Reverend Jack Hamilton,
the congregation spent its first several years
gathering out of Reverend Hamilton’s home.
In 1920, services would be moved to its cur-
rent location on Ash Street in Frisco. The
original building and lot were donated by Rev.
Hamilton, and in 1924 a new building was
erected in the same space. During the week,
the building would serve as Hamilton Elemen-
tary, a school for African American students in
the community. While the school would close
its doors in 1964, the church would remain as
a consistent source of spiritual unity within the
growing and closely knit community.

In the late 1960s and 1970s, the building
would be renovated under the leadership of
Reverend Arthur Maxwell, who led the church
for thirty-three years. Today, the church proud-
ly stands under the leadership of Rev. Henry
Thomas. While Hamilton Chapel Baptist
Church has undergone many changes in its
105-year history, its overall mission has
stayed the same.
Madam Speaker, today I urge my col-
leagues to join me in recognizing Hamilton
Chapel Baptist Church for serving as a place
of praise and worship in the Frisco community
for the past 105 years.
