CONGRATULATING DAVID BLOM
ON HIS RETIREMENT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY) for 5 minutes.
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to express my deepest gratitude
and to recognize the career of David P.
Blom, who is retiring as president and
CEO of OhioHealth after 36 years.
David became president of Grant Med-
ical Center, located in downtown Co-
lumbus in my district.
Dave set out to make healthcare
more accessible to underserved and di-
verse populations. Providing care to
our most at-risk population was a
focus of his for 30 years, and it is one
that he has never lost. Mr. Speaker, I
know that firsthand because I had the
opportunity to witness his work.
I am so honored that David is with us
today in the gallery.
As president of the entire OhioHealth
system for the past 17 years, Dave has
molded and elevated OhioHealth’s com-
mitment to all of the communities it
serves as the largest hospital system in
central Ohio.
Let me tell Members what I have wit-
nessed.
When we talked about our babies and
infant mortality, I remember it so well
when Dave made that call and said we
are going to keep our babies healthy.
Thus, he spearheaded Wellness on
Wheels’ Women’s Health, or as we like
to call it in our home district, WOW,
and what a wow it has been.
There is not enough time for me to
highlight all the things that this in-
credible leader has done, but let me
fast-forward to my time in Congress. I
can remember how and when Congress-
man STEVE STIVERS and I talked about
the great work, and there was an op-
portunity when then-Speaker Boehner
wanted to revise the whole system for
our veterans. STEVE STIVERS, a vet-
eran, and Dave Blom, caring about our
veterans, thus, he was appointed to the
Federal commission to reform the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs.
I can remember the exciting day
when Dave Blom walked into my office,
and it was the same day that we were
having the House Chamber’s joint ses-
sion to hear the Japanese Prime Min-
ister. I remember how excited he was
to hear that we were going to host the
Japanese Prime Minister, how great it
was when he sat front and center in the
gallery to hear that message.
The list goes on and on, but today is
simply a day to say the two most pow-
erful words that I can say about a great
leader, about someone who has changed
the healthcare system not just for my
district or Columbus, but for the Na-
tion, and those two words are ‘‘thank
you.’’
Thank you for being a leader. Thank
you for being a public servant. But
most of all, Dave P. Blom, thank you,
thank you for being my friend. I salute
you.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair would remind Members to avoid
referencing occupants of the gallery.
f
CONGRATULATING DAVID BLOM
ON HIS RETIREMENT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Ohio (Mr. STIVERS) for 5 minutes.
Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the career of Dave
Blom as he retires after 17 years of
service as president and CEO of
OhioHealth this July.
While his leadership in the industry
is unparalleled, as a veteran, I want to
focus on what strikes me about Dave
the most, and that is his commitment
to improving access to healthcare for
those who have served our Nation.
In 2014, the Department of Veterans
Affairs was facing rising numbers na-
tionally, and, unfortunately, many vet-
erans were not receiving the good care
that they deserved. As a result, the
Congressional Commission on Care was
formed, a 15-person task force that
would make recommendations about
how to best serve our Nation’s veterans
with healthcare.
I knew Dave’s knowledge of
healthcare and longstanding commit-
ment to our Nation’s heroes made him
an outstanding candidate for that Com-
mission, and I was proud to work with
my colleagues, Representative BEATTY
and Representative Tiberi, at the time,
to secure him an appointment from
Speaker Boehner.
In 2015, Dave Blom and the Commis-
sion got to work. After over 10 months

of effort, they ultimately produced 18
reforms for the VA and Congress, in-
cluding the VA Mission Act, which
gives veterans access to local providers
outside the VA system and guarantees
timely access to care.
Dave was a vital contributor to these
reforms, and I know he counts his time
on the Commission among the most re-
warding experiences of his life.
It is impossible to quantify the im-
pact that he has had on the lives of
millions of veterans and their families
across this country, but it is certain to
resonate with veterans far into the fu-
ture.
I am incredibly grateful for Dave’s
service and his leadership, and I wish
him all the best in his next chapter of
life. I am confident that he will remain
involved in central Ohio and its com-
munities for a long time to come. I am
also fortunate to call him a friend. He
is a great leader in healthcare, and he
has been a great leader for our country.
I thank Dave Blom for his service to
our veterans, and I congratulate him
on an incredible career in healthcare.
f
STOP ANTI-SEMITISM
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER) for 5 minutes.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, on
Saturday, our Nation was again
stunned by yet another horrific attack
on Americans gathered at worship.
Saturday’s shooting at the Chabad of
Poway synagogue in California came as
Jews around the world celebrated the
last day of Passover.
One woman, Lori Gilbert Kaye, was
murdered in the attack and three oth-
ers were wounded. I continue to pray
for the recovery of those injured in the
shooting and offer my deepest condo-
lences to the family and friends of the
victims.
The latest attack happened exactly 6
months to the day after the assault on
worshipers at the Tree of Life syna-
gogue in Pittsburgh, which claimed the
lives of 11 people, the deadliest attack
on the American Jewish community in
our history.
These shootings were committed
against a backdrop of rising anti-Semi-
tism both here at home and around the
world.
According to the Anti-Defamation
League, in 2017, anti-Semitic incidents
surged in the United States by 57 per-
cent. This represented the largest sin-
gle-year increase on record and the sec-
ond highest number of incidents since
the ADL started tracking such data in
1979. In 2018, we saw nearly the same
number of reported incidents as in 2017.
In recent weeks, there have been
other chilling displays of anti-Semi-
tism beyond our borders as well. In
February, a Belgian carnival float fea-
tured grotesque caricatures of Ortho-
dox Jews standing on large piles of
money. On Easter Sunday in a small
Polish village, adults and children beat
and burned an effigy of Judas, but the
effigy did not look like a character
from Biblical times. Rather, it was a
stereotypical Orthodox Jew dressed in
ninth century Hasidic garb.
Feeding into these dangerous inci-
dents, just last week, the international
edition of The New York Times pub-
lished a disgusting anti-Semitic car-
toon. The paper subsequently apolo-
gized, but the damage was already
done. It was an astonishing editorial
failure by one of the Nation’s most im-
portant papers of record. I was pleased
today to see the editorial board of the
Times directly address this issue.
Especially at these times of growing
anti-Semitism, we must all be extra
vigilant, lest we add fuel to the flames
of hate and intolerance.
Whenever and wherever we see anti-
Semitism, we must speak out to stanch
it, for what begins as stereotypes and
cartoons far too often leads to violence
that has claimed so many lives
throughout our history.
Our Nation was founded on the idea
that every American of every religion
has the fundamental right to practice
their faith without fear of persecution
or violence. This was established in the
very first amendment to our Constitu-
tion and enshrined in our Bill of
Rights. But this right has been shat-
tered far too many times at the syna-
gogues in Poway and Pittsburgh; at an
African American church in Charles-
ton, South Carolina; and at a Sikh
temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin.
I will not repeat the Poway shooter’s
name or give him the notoriety he
sought, but it is clear that he was mo-
tivated by white supremacism and
anti-Semitism, citing the shootings at
the mosque in Christchurch, New Zea-
land, and the Tree of Life synagogue in
Pittsburgh in his manifesto.
The sad truth is, far-right white su-
premacists have been responsible for
more terror attacks and deaths in the
United States in the past two decades
than any other domestic extremist
movement. We need to update our laws
to reflect the growing threat of domes-
tic terrorism.
That is why I introduced, with Sen-
ator RICHARD DURBIN, the Domestic
Terrorism Prevention Act, legislation
that would strengthen coordination
among the Federal agencies in moni-
toring radicalized groups and individ-
uals and, hopefully, preventing hateful
acts of violence.
This is a necessary first step to help
our law enforcement agencies contain
the threat, and I urge my colleagues to
join me on this legislation.
We also have a duty to responsibly
update our gun laws. I am proud that
this House voted earlier this year to
pass universal background checks and
close the Charleston loophole, a loop-
hole that allowed the Emanuel AME
shooter to acquire a firearm before the
results of his FBI background check
were complete.
We need the Senate to stop
stonewalling and bring these bills up
for a vote.
Mr. Speaker, I cannot help but re-
flect that, this week, the United States
is observing Holocaust Remembrance
Week and honoring the 6 million Jews
and millions of others murdered by the
Nazi regime.
In the memory of all of those lost to
anti-Semitism and other forms of hate,
we have a moral responsibility to
stamp out intolerance and prejudice in
our time. Otherwise, as the late Elie
Wiesel famously said: ‘‘To forget the
victims means to kill them a second
time.’’
f
HONORING HOLOCAUST VICTIMS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL) for 5 minutes.
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor the 6 million Jewish
men, women, and children who were
violently murdered for their religious
beliefs by the Nazi regime.
This week remembers the victims
who lost their lives to this evil regime
and honors the survivors who beat the
unthinkable odds.
Sonia Warshawski, a Kansan from
Overland Park, was a young teenager
when Nazi Germany invaded her home
in Poland. She was imprisoned, locked
inside a Nazi concentration camp, and
then later sent to the Auschwitz death
camp. There, she saw human hatred in
a way many of us today cannot com-
prehend.
Sonia tells a story of waking up each
day suffering from starvation and see-
ing thousands of bodies stacked where
she was imprisoned. She watched as
her mother was forced into a gas cham-
ber. And still, through this torture and
through it all, she never gave up hope
or abandoned her faith.
Sonia will not forget the hatred and
horrific injustice that the murderous
Nazi regime put her and millions of
others through in the name of anti-
Semitism and neither will this coun-
try.
As the most well-documented geno-
cide in human history, a genocide doc-
umented and confirmed by General Ei-
senhower, the evil and unimaginable
torture throughout the Holocaust will
forever haunt us. We must never tol-
erate or overlook anti-Semitism in any
form.
In 2017, I had an emotional experi-
ence at the Holocaust museum in Israel
with my wife. There, we met and heard
from many survivors and walked
through the Hall of Names honoring
the 6 million victims of the Holocaust.
Sadly, we have recently seen the ugly
face of anti-Semitism rearing its ugly
head. We must continue to fight it with
full force. It should be made abun-
dantly clear to those with this deep ha-
tred of Jewish people in their heart
that this country has zero tolerance for
this type of evil.
Mr. Speaker, I stand with the sur-
vivors like Sonia and those who lost
their lives during the darkest days in
the history of our world, and I stand
against anti-Semitism.

JUDICIAL OVERREACH
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to discuss my disappointment at
the judicial overreach by my home
State’s supreme court this past Friday.
In a 6–1 vote, the radical Kansas
courts ruled the State’s constitution
guarantees unlimited rights to an abor-
tion. This verdict came in response to
a 2015 State law that prohibits per-
forming a dismemberment abortion
procedure in the second trimester, ex-
cept when necessary to save the life of
the mother. Two doctors who per-
formed this barbaric and painful proce-
dure in the second trimester of preg-
nancy have challenged the law.
As someone who has dedicated my
career to bringing life into this world
and has delivered 5,000 babies in my
home State of Kansas, please forgive
me and allow me to be graphic for just
a moment.
This horrid procedure literally tears
the live baby apart limb by limb in the
womb and then evacuates the dis-
membered baby body parts one at a
time from the uterus. Then the person
who performs the procedure pieces
these parts back together to make sure
they have removed the entire baby.
This very pain-capable baby literally
bleeds to death to end its life.
Sadly, the method is used today in 95
percent of second trimester abortions,
even though the child’s heart is beat-
ing and the baby is breathing and, as I
said earlier, is quite capable of feeling
pain. It is despicable, and this proce-
dure should be banned nationwide.
It sickens me to the core that the
Kansas Supreme Court violated the
sanctity of life and voted to deny the
rights of the unborn in our State.
Today, I call upon our State legisla-
tors to quickly pass a constitutional
amendment that overrules and protects
these precious babies.
Many of us have fought our whole life
to defend the unborn. Now, we must all
fight harder than ever. I ask for you to
fight alongside me.
f
HONORING REV. DR. CHARLES E.
BOOTH
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I
know that Representative JOYCE
BEATTY would join me today in what I
am about to say.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a great
American and a distinguished man of
God, the Reverend Dr. Charles E.
Booth. Dr. Booth transitioned from
this earthly plain on Saturday, March
23, 2019, after a valiant battle with can-
cer.
Dr. Booth’s life and mine moved
along many of the same paths.
Through those shared experiences, we
developed a deep personal bond.
He was born in my hometown of Bal-
timore, Maryland, on February 4, 1947,
to Hazel Willis Booth and William W.
Booth. He attended the same high
school as I did, Baltimore City College
High School in Baltimore. We also at-
tended the same college, Howard Uni-
versity.
Dr. Booth went on to earn a master’s
of divinity degree from Eastern Theo-
logical Seminary in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania. He then earned a doc-
torate of ministry degree from United
Theological Seminary in Dayton, Ohio.
As a testament to his commitment to
Christian education, Dr. Booth served
as a member of the board of trustees of
that institution from 2011 until his re-
cent passing.
At the age of 23, Dr. Booth pastored
his first church, St. Paul’s Baptist
Church in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
In 1978, he became pastor of Mount Oli-
vet Baptist Church in Columbus, Ohio,
where he remained the faithful leader
for 41 years.
Dr. Booth proudly made Columbus
his home, but he never forgot his roots.
He visited Baltimore often to preach at
various churches and spend time with
family and friends. In fact, he preached
revival services each year in my own
church, the New Psalmist Baptist
Church, where Dr. Bishop Walter Scott
Thomas, Sr., is the pastor. When I was
not in Washington, I was at church to
listen to his prolific sermons.
As the son of two preachers, I under-
stand the power of the preached word,
and Dr. Booth could deliver like none
other. They often called him a preach-
ing machine. He had a commanding
presence in the pulpit with his tow-
ering stature and baritone voice. He
studied the Bible voraciously and had
the uncanny ability to make Biblical
text relevant to the issues we face
today in our daily lives. At a time
when people are turning away from
traditional religion, Dr. Booth made
Christianity accessible and inspired
people to deepen their faith.
Dr. Booth was a pastor’s pastor. He
traveled the world to preach the gos-
pel, and he was tremendously respected
by his peers. He found joy in mentoring
young preachers and made time to lis-
ten to their concerns and offer his
counsel.
In 2011, Dr. Booth founded the
Charles E. Booth Preaching Con-
ference, which focuses on the tenets of
keeping passion in one’s preaching,
Christ-centered preaching in contem-
porary life, building relationships with
preachers, strengthening the preacher’s
devotional life, and remaining true to
the sermonic ingredients of informa-
tion and inspiration.
Education was central to Dr. Booth’s
life. Not only was he continually learn-
ing, but he also encouraged others to
use education as a key to open doors of
opportunity. In 1994, he founded the
Gloria S. Friend Academy, a fully ac-
credited elementary school at his
church that emphasized academic ex-
cellence and cultural enrichment cen-
tered on African American history. Dr.
Booth also authored several books fo-
cused on Christian education.
A pillar in his community, Dr. Booth
used his position as a faith leader to be
a strong voice for the voiceless. He
worked tirelessly to help create solu-
tions to issues such as poverty, home-
lessness, unemployment, and access to
quality healthcare.
As I mourn the loss of my friend, I
am comforted by the inspiring legacy
he leaves for all of us. In the New Tes-
tament book of Titus, the Apostle Paul
writes: ‘‘Show yourself in all respects
to be a model of good works, and in
your teaching show integrity, dignity,
and sound speech.’’
Dr. Booth lived this creed. Through
his example, he encouraged everyone
he encountered to do the same.
He leaves to mourn his wonderful
wife, Crystal. He was a tremendous
blessing to his family, his church, his
Nation, and, indeed, the world.
He will be sorely missed, but we give
great thanks that God allowed our
lives to eclipse with his.

TEACHER APPRECIATION WEEK
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5
minutes.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, as
we approach Teacher Appreciation
Week, I would like to recognize an ex-
traordinary educator in Bucks County,
Pennsylvania, who is making a dif-
ference in the lives of our community’s
young people.
George Daka, a U.S. history teacher
at Bensalem High School, was recently
selected as an honoree for the 13th an-
nual Teacher as Hero Awards. Later
this month, George will receive his
award at the National Liberty Museum
in Philadelphia alongside 11 other out-
standing educators from Pennsylvania
and Delaware.
George sees his job as more than just
teaching his students about history,
and he seeks to inspire them about our
Nation’s rich traditions. We applaud
George on this well-deserved award,
and we wish him and his family all the
best.
We would also like to thank Kathryn
Hinshaw, an English teacher at
Bensalem High School, for nominating
George for this well-deserved honor.
CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF MARJORIE
BURTIS
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the 100th birth-
day of a Bucks County resident who is
sharing her talent and creativity with
others.
Last month, Langhorne resident
Marjorie Burtis celebrated her incred-
ible milestone with more than 100 fam-
ily members and friends.
This was no ordinary birthday cele-
bration, however. It also served as the
unveiling of Marjorie’s new art exhibit
at the Bucks County Visitor Center.
Despite her many life experiences,
Marjorie discovered her passion for wa-
tercolor painting merely 12 years ago
after taking an art class. Since that

Mr. Speaker, we wish Marjorie a very

congratulate her on her exhibit.
We thank Marjorie and her family for

RECOGNIZING THE BENSALEM HIGH SCHOOL JAZZ
BAND
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize a talented
group of young musicians from Bucks
County, Pennsylvania, who were re-
cently honored for their performances.
Last month, the Bensalem High
School Jazz Band traveled to perform
in the Cavalcade of Bands Jazz Cham-
pionships. Bensalem High School Jazz
Band, well-known for their outstanding
performances, was the only band given
the superior rating at the event and
was also named grand champion.
This is the third time that Bensalem
High School Jazz Band has been named
grand champion over the past 11 years,
a testament to the band’s skills, dedi-
cation, and work ethic.
Critical to the success of these young
people is the director of the Bensalem
High School Jazz Band, Michael Zim-
merman. We extend our gratitude to
him for working with our community’s
youth and students to sharpen their
musical abilities, and we congratulate
all performers in the Bensalem High
School Jazz Band for their earned dis-
tinctions.
f
RECOGNIZING MILTON ‘‘WOODY’’
WOODSIDE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Mr. Milton
‘‘Woody’’ Woodside for serving more
than 30 years as president of the Bruns-
wick-Golden Isles Chamber of Com-
merce.
After graduating from the Citadel,
Mr. Woodside has dedicated his entire
career to public service. Without his
work, coastal Georgia would likely
look very different than it does today.
To start, he worked 13 years for the
First Congressional District of Georgia
with Representatives Bo Ginn and
Lindsay Thomas. Since his work with
the House of Representatives, he has
held the top position with the Chamber
of Commerce and is one of the longest
continually serving chamber leaders in
Georgia.
In his position with the chamber, Mr.
Woodside advocated for the creation of
the South Georgia Parkway, funding to
deepen the Port of Brunswick, a re-
placement for the Sidney Lanier
Bridge, the building of both the Golden
Isles Convention Center along with the
Career Academy, and much more.
Whether it was at the Capitol in
Washington, D.C., the statehouse in
Georgia, or the mayor’s office in
Brunswick, Mr. Woodside was con-
stantly working to help Brunswick
grow. Although he is retiring on May
15, I am sure that Mr. Woodside will
continue to help the Brunswick com-
munity in any way he can.
Woody, thank you for your service.
You have been an inspiration to all of
us. You were an icon in our commu-
nity. Our community thanks you, our
State thanks you, our country thanks
you, and I thank you, my friend.
REMEMBERING ROY KENT HODNETT
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember the life of
Mr. Roy Kent Hodnett who passed
away at the age of 98 on Friday, April
26.
Known throughout Glynn County in
the First Congressional District as a
gentleman with a caring personality,
he brightened the day of everyone
around him.
He served in France during World
War II directly after D-day, earning the
Purple Heart, Bronze Star, and Victory
Medal. When he came home to the
United States, he stopped in St. Si-
mons Island while vacationing, fell in
love with the area, bought a home that
same weekend, and started raising a
family.
While there, he built one of the most
successful companies in the area,
Hodnett Cooper Real Estate and Vaca-
tion Rentals.
Through all of this, Mr. Hodnett’s
passion was with his family and his
community. For him, the key to a suc-
cessful business was having a wife of 75
years who has stood beside him and be-
lieved in him. He also mentored and ad-
vised countless young people, helping
them to find their own paths through
life.
I am proud to have had Mr. Hodnett
spend so much of his life in the First
Congressional District of Georgia. His
family and friends will be in my
thoughts and prayers during this time.
f
FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI) for 5 minutes.
Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I am
proud to be cosponsoring H.R. 9, which
we will be voting on this week.
H.R. 9 reaffirms the United States’
commitment to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. It is long past time that we
do more to fight climate change.
Fighting climate change has been a
priority of mine since I got to Congress
more than a decade ago. In 2007, in an
era of divided government, we were
able to make some progress. I was able
to get two bills passed into law that
address climate change. One required
the Federal Government to cut energy
usage by installing energy-efficient
light bulbs in Federal buildings. The
other created a new prize competition
to encourage development of clean
transportation fuel. It seemed that we
were starting to take climate change
seriously.
In 2009 and 2010, more steps were
taken. In order to make a major break-
through, in 2009, I helped introduce the
first bipartisan bill to impose a rev-
enue-neutral carbon fee. However, in
2010, Congress failed to pass major cli-
mate legislation, and since then, we
have failed to make more progress.
Today, I have renewed hope. H.R. 9 is
a good first step, but much more needs
to be done. I am an original cosponsor
of the bipartisan Energy Innovation
and Carbon Dividend Act, which would
institute a carbon fee with the revenue
returned to Americans with a dividend
check. This bill would bring green-
house gas emissions down 90 percent by
2050.
I have sponsored several other cli-
mate change bills, including the Chal-
lenges & Prizes for Climate Act, which
would incentivize and reward develop-
ment of innovative solutions with di-
rect benefits to the climate. These are
all ways to harness American inge-
nuity to solve our climate crisis.
b 1030
In doing so, by coming up with an
American solution, we could build our

CLIMATE CHANGE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Utah (Mr. CURTIS) for 5 minutes.
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, Utahns
believe in being good stewards of our
planet, leaving the Earth better than
we found it.
When I served as the mayor of Provo,
we pursued policies to construct
LEAD-certified buildings, create more
environmentally friendly transit op-
tions, and educate our residents on how
they can be better stewards of the envi-
ronment. We considered these efforts
to be meaningful steps in the right di-
rection.
But, imagine my surprise when I ar-
rived in Congress and learned of the
dangerous winner-take-all system of
governing that has overtaken Wash-
ington, especially on issues impacting
the environment.
Instead of a pragmatic approach to a
positive change through small and con-
sistent consensus, an all-or-nothing ap-
proach dominates the debate and
villainizes all but the most extreme po-
sitions.
Congress is a place where ideological
purity is rewarded more than results.
It is easy to vote on a messaging bill
that the sponsor knows will never be
passed into law and then go home and
take the applause from the like-minded
constituents, but it is difficult to leave
the echo chambers and work across the
aisle with individuals who have dif-
ferent backgrounds than yourself and
find common ground.
The most obvious example of this is
the climate change debate in our coun-
try where, today, my Democratic col-
leagues have taken the easy path. The

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3347

bill we are voting on today has 224
Democratic sponsors and not a single
Republican sponsor.
Instead of working with Republicans
on our four-part approach to address-
ing climate change through innova-
tion, conservation, adaptation, and
preparation, we are sending a partisan
bill to die in the Senate.
I attempted to work with my col-
leagues on this bill. I offered a good-
faith amendment that would increase
transparency and competition by com-
paring emissions produced by all the
countries in the Paris Agreement. This
amendment wasn’t even allowed a vote
by the Democratic leadership, although
there was no problem allowing votes
from their Democratic friends’ amend-
ments.
In fact, only three Republican
amendments will be considered, and 26
Democratic amendments will be of-
fered for debate.
It is as if my colleagues on the other
side are afraid of hurting the feelings
of China and Russia by pointing out
that they are not pulling their weight.
I have long been a proponent for the
environment, and I was proud to re-
ceive the Utah Clean Air Partnership
Person of the Year award in 2017. I have
championed hundreds of thousands of
acres of bipartisan conservation in
Utah.
I, like all Utahns, care deeply about
conserving our planet and our way of
life for future generations, but I cannot
vote for H.R. 9 because I believe it fur-
ther divides us apart, reinforcing the
false narrative that all Republicans
don’t care about the environment be-
cause they are unwilling to get on
board with an all-or-nothing, unreal-
istic approach to addressing climate
change.
H.R. 9 completely ignores the serious
and legitimate concerns about the cost
and effectiveness of the Paris Agree-
ment.
H.R. 9 ignores that President
Obama’s pledge to the Paris Agreement
could cost the United States $250 bil-
lion and nearly 3 million jobs in this
next 6 years; and it ignores that, in the
next 20 years, this commitment could
cost us $3 trillion and 6.5 million Amer-
ican jobs.
H.R. 9 also ignores that, because of
innovation and technological improve-
ment, the United States is already
leading the world in reducing green-
house gas emissions. Since 2000, the
United States has decreased annual
carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 800
million tons, the largest absolute de-
cline among all countries since 2000.
H.R. 9 ignores the fact that, if the
United States cut CO2 emissions to
zero, it would not even come close to
offsetting the emissions coming from
the rest of the world.
H.R. 9 even ignores that the Paris
Agreement allows China, the Earth’s
largest greenhouse gas polluter, to in-
crease their emissions through 2030
with little evidence to show that they
plan to comply in the future.
I have heard over and over that the
U.S. must remain in the Paris Agree-
ment to show leadership. And I ask
you: What kind of leadership leads to
double-digit unemployment in rural
America but lets China off the hook?
I agree that America must continue
to show leadership, but let’s focus on
leadership that goes back to the core
principles of innovation, conservation,
adaptation, and preparation. This bill
fails to do any of that.
Let’s continue leading the world and
bettering our environment, but let’s
not pretend that H.R. 9 is a silver bul-
let to our evolving world.
I hope that we can stop with the
easy, cheap rhetoric that offers false
promises and divides our country even
further and focus on those things that
make meaningful change.

HONORING RALPH VANNI
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to honor my
friend Ralph Vanni, the senior House
audio technician who retired earlier
this month.
For 34 years, Ralph has been the man
behind this microphone and every
microphone in this Chamber. When he
took his job as the House technician in
1985, Ralph was no stranger to Capitol
Hill. At the age of 16, he landed an in-
ternship with the then-Senate majority
leader.
After two more internships and grad-
uating college, Ralph had a hand in
nearly every corner of the Capitol
building, from doorkeeper for the Ser-
geant at Arms to working in the Sen-
ate Cloakroom.
In his most recent role, Ralph saw six
Presidents give their State of the
Union speeches, but the day he has said
he will never forget is running audio
from that perch right up there for Pope
Francis’ address to this Chamber in
2015.
I remember meeting Ralph on my
first day as a newly elected Member of
Congress during orientation in 2013.
With the Speaker’s permission, we
could take photos on the House floor
that day, and I took a minute to take
one with Ralph and some of his team
and the many folks who do a wonderful
job guarding this Chamber every day.
Ralph became my friend that day and
has been my friend for the last 61⁄2
years I have had the chance to serve in
this great institution. I wish him the
best in his retirement. And I want to
thank him personally, on behalf of
every Member of Congress who stands
behind any microphone in this institu-
tion.
Ralph made us sound better, and we
appreciate him for doing that. I wish
him good luck in his retirement and
thank him for all his years of service.
I am going to miss Ralph, looking up
in that perch, but I am going to get to
know the folks who have replaced him
so well. He has led a great generation
into that seat to replace him now.
I thank Ralph Vanni.

SOLITO, SOLITA
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. SPEIER) for 5 minutes.
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, innocent
children shouldn’t pay the price for the
President’s cruel immigration agenda.
Steamrolling the facts and the law, he
has implemented policy after failed
policy, playing catch and release with
his own cabinet.
As the President ratchets up his
threats to close the border and cut aid
to Central America, thousands of mi-
grants are fleeing their home countries
to seek refuge in the United States.
I recently met with the editors of the
book ‘‘Solito, Solita’’—Alone, Alone—a
collection of oral histories that tells
the stories of young refugees in their
own words. I rise today to read ex-
cerpts from one of them, Gabriel
Mendez.
His story begins in a poor, dangerous
neighborhood in the capital of Hon-
duras. He says:
When I was just a boy of 7, my cousins
raped me for a long time—for a year. They
raped me at the river, where they collected
water—and in my own home.
. . . Some of my fellow students who be-
longed to the maras took weapons to school.
I told the mareros that I didn’t want to bring
weapons to school. I was afraid of them.
They also wanted me to bring drugs into
school. I didn’t want to do it, so I left that
school. . . . Now the maras were looking for
me—to kill me. They were asking my neigh-
bors if they knew me.
When Gabriel was 14, he convinced
his mother, who was living in San
Francisco, to pay a coyote $6,000 to
bring him to the United States. Gabriel
recounted the horrors he encountered
along the way.
. . . they kept us locked in a house with
eight other people for a week. We kept mov-
ing. Many days passed without eating or
drinking water.
We were taken to the river, where there
was a raft. We crossed the river into the
United States and moved to a safe house. We
spent 4 nights in the desert, including the
night of my 15th birthday.
. . . We came upon another group of people
who’d been traveling 2 days ahead of us. A
young man, under 18, had perished from ex-
posure and lack of water and food. I got
stuck in some barbed wire in the desert. The
coyote kicked me, ripping my flesh to set me
free.
. . . We got to Los Angeles on December 17,
2013. If we didn’t pay more money, they
threatened to cut off our heads and all kinds
of horrible things. My mom said she’d give
them another $50, and they piled another 8
people in a van and brought us to San Fran-
cisco.
In San Francisco, Gabriel feared for
years he would be sent back to Hon-
duras. With the support of his mother
and an attorney, he was eventually
granted asylum.
Now he is a student at the University
of California at Berkeley, with dreams
of becoming a lawyer himself.

In an essay, he wrote:
My experience of childhood sexual and do-
mestic abuse has shaped my dreams to be-
come a lawyer, to defend victims and fight
for children’s rights around the world. My
immigration lawyer was a role model for me
because she listened to my experiences. I
want to continue studying to help children
feel protected by the law . . .
If we want to understand the why be-
hind mass migration, we need to listen
and learn from these stories.
As Members of Congress, it is our job
to uplift these voices and use them to
fix a broken immigration system. We
must insist on due process for asylum
seekers; we must insist on humane
treatment of our families; and we must
insist on aid to Central America to
stem the drivers of migration.
Together, we can prevent more chil-
dren from risking their lives.

Almighty God, we come before Your
throne of grace and salvation in prayer
for the men and women of this Con-

with Your peace and protection.
Give them strength to rely upon
Your faithfulness, always serving oth-

Give them strength to be a rock and
a mighty fortress when feeling crushed
by an avalanche of criticism.
Give them strength to collaborate
and spur each other on toward good
works. As iron sharpens iron, may they
sharpen one another.
Give them strength to display cour-
age with the power of persistence in ad-
vancing American ideals, their feet
closely following Your steps without
turning aside. For You are their guide,
their moral compass. You are the way,
the truth, and the life.
Secure their leadership in Your di-

of Your blessing for every American,
now and forever.
Amen.

WELCOMING REVEREND DR.
ANDREW CHANEY
The SPEAKER. Without objection,

Reverend Dr. Andrew Chaney, along
with his wife, Christine, and my wife,
Barbara, in the gallery, and the Hargis

as the senior minister at the historic
First and Calvary Presbyterian Church
in Springfield, Missouri, a church that
is a very special place for my family.
Reverend Chaney serves as an impor-

PAVING THE WAY FOR WOMEN IN
STEM
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker,
science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics, or STEM, is an industry
comprised of physicists, chemical and
biomedical engineers, and professionals
creating and developing innovative
technologies.
Demand for workers in these fields is
high, but women remain underrep-
resented, especially in engineering and
computer sciences. According to a
study by the National Girls Collabo-
rative, women make up nearly 50 per-
cent of the overall workforce but less
than 30 percent of careers in STEM.
Women have made tremendous
strides in this field over the last few
decades, but women’s underrepresenta-
tion in STEM limits discoveries and
holds back our economy. Today I want
to tell Members about an outstanding
woman in my district who is paving
the way for women in STEM.
Aria Soha from Batavia, Illinois,
works as the installation coordinator
for the Short-Baseline Neutrino Pro-
gram at Fermi National Laboratory.
Aria was an outstanding student in
math throughout school and chose to
major in physics her second year of col-
lege at Carnegie Mellon University.
In college, Aria worked relentlessly
to find research opportunities and got
the chance to build microwave tele-
scopes, tools to examine high-energy
radio waves that are hard to observe
from the ground. After graduating,
Aria accepted a job at Fermi Lab, a
world-class research facility we are
proud of in the 14th District.
There are so many hidden figures in
STEM, and I am proud to shine a
bright light on the strong, smart
women in the 14th District leading and
making a difference in our community.

REMEMBERING FORMER SENATOR
RICHARD LUGAR
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize
former Senator Richard Lugar, who
passed away Sunday at the age of 87.
Senator Lugar served the State of In-
diana for 36 years in Congress and was
a leading voice on issues at home and
abroad.
Senator Lugar was a man of strong
integrity who stood by what he be-
lieved in, and Senator Lugar always
was willing to work with colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to reach a shared
goal: bipartisanship.
In 2003, the State Department estab-
lished a Kennedy-Lugar YES Abroad
program, named for Senator Lugar and
Senator Ted Kennedy. The program
provides scholarships for students from
the United States and countries with
significant Muslim populations to
spend 1 year in the other’s country. It
fosters the same goals that Senator
Lugar dedicated his life to achieving:
understanding, collaboration, and
friendship with the rest of the world.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Senator Lugar
for his legendary service. Senator
Lugar leaves a long record of legisla-
tive accomplishments. I offer my con-
dolences to his family.
May Senator Lugar rest in peace, and
may we learn from the example that he
set.

ics team for being crowned the world
champions.
They are the home of the Coyotes,
and this hardworking group of 15 stu-
dents from my district, otherwise
known as MadTown Robotics, beat out
more than 400 teams not only through-
out the country, but throughout the
world, in a competition in Houston,
Texas, in the last week. They worked
long hours on this project, with each
student member putting in more than
200 hours, including weekends.
The community celebrated their suc-
cess last weekend with a parade
through Madera and a rally at the
school gym, which I participated in. I
am exceptionally proud of these stu-
dents, their teachers, and the faculty
for their accomplishments.
Madera is a wonderful, growing area,

ley is not only a world leader in agri-
culture, but also in innovation, for fu-
ture generations across our country.

MAY 1 IS THE DEADLINE FOR
DISASTER SUPPLEMENTAL
(Mr. DUNN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
because we have failed our military
and all the victims of 2018 disasters
across the country.
On October 10, Tyndall Air Force
Base took a direct hit from a category
5 hurricane. Over 6 months later, no
disaster funding has been provided. Air
Force Secretary Wilson warned us that
if she did not receive supplemental
funding by May 1, all new work on Tyn-
dall Air Force Base would stop. This
delays the return of base operations,
impacts flight operations throughout
the Air Force, and forces our airmen to
work in degraded facilities.
Mr. Speaker, May 1 has come, and I
stand before you today because we
have failed to deliver funding, and now
our military readiness is suffering. We
only have until May 15 to provide fund-
ing to the Air Force before they start
cutting airplane repairs.
I urge the leadership of the House
and the Senate to pass a clean disaster
supplemental immediately. It is nec-
essary, and it is the right thing to do.

BUILDING BUFFALO’S
WATERFRONT
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and

Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr.
Speaker, a $50 million Federal invest-
ment to create a parkway opened ac-
cess to Buffalo’s outer harbor water-
front 10 years ago. That parkway was
the catalyst for new development that
started with Gallagher Beach; a new
State park, Wilkeson Pointe; and new
parkland on the former NFTA property
from terminal A and B to the Seaway
Pier and beyond.
This Thursday, the Canal Corpora-
tion will announce more than $100 mil-
lion in new investments to open up 180
acres and improve access to the outer

falo waterfront development is coming,
development to move Buffalo forward
with a new, exciting waterfront of pos-
sibilities.

Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today with some great news for the
residents of my district, the Fifth Dis-
trict of Virginia.
Southern Virginia was selected as
Microsoft’s newest TechSpark commu-
nity. The goal of the TechSpark pro-
gram is to accelerate economic growth
through expanding broadband
connectivity, career pathways in dig-
ital transformation.
This $5 million investment has a po-
tential to be a game changer for south-
ern Virginia, and this project partners
perfectly with the work I have been
doing in Congress providing rural
broadband and increasing economic op-
portunities in Southside Virginia.
Private investment is always encour-
aged and preferred, but we also need to
use private-public partnerships to ex-
pand access to broadband.
Communities in my district are in
desperate need of broadband access,
and this investment in South Boston
will be an example of how we can en-
courage innovation and spur economic
growth that will help families around
this country.

MUELLER REPORT
(Mr. TED LIEU of California asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute and to revise

Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr.
Speaker, in the last 24 hours, we have
discovered that Special Counsel Robert
Mueller wrote a letter to Attorney
General Bill Barr saying that the At-
torney General mischaracterized the
Mueller report. That is an extraor-
dinary letter.
I am now going to read into the
House CONGRESSIONAL RECORD the rel-
evant portions of that letter, which is
dated March 27, 2019, from Robert
Mueller to Bill Barr.
He writes: ‘‘The summary letter the
Department sent to Congress and re-
leased to the public late in the after-
noon of March 24 did not fully capture
the context, nature, and substance of
this Office’s work and conclusions. We
communicated that concern to the De-
partment on the morning of March 25.
There is now public confusion about
critical aspects of the results of our in-
vestigation. This threatens to under-
mine a central purpose for which the
Department appointed the Special
Counsel: to assure full public con-
fidence in the outcome of the inves-
tigations.’’
Bill Barr is supposed to be the attor-
ney for all Americans. He is supposed
to be the people’s attorney, not Donald
Trump’s personal attorney. He does not
understand that. He needs to resign.

Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise as we
mark National Minority Health Month,
and I urge my colleagues to stand with
one voice as we demand universal
healthcare coverage for every Amer-
ican, not as a privilege, but as a human
right.
Your healthcare should not depend
on your ZIP Code. But for far too many
Americans, healthcare disparities
mean higher rates of chronic illness,
less access to quality care, and shorter
life spans.
In the U.S. in 2019, African Ameri-
cans, Latinos, and Native Americans
still suffer from much higher rates of
diabetes, cancer, heart disease, stroke,
substance abuse, infant mortality, low
birth weight, HIV, and AIDS.
These deadly disparities are rooted in
economic injustice, racism, and our
failure, as a nation, to value and pro-
tect the health and well-being of every
American equally.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support full funding for lifesaving re-
search, federally qualified health cen-
ters, and public health programs that
promote prevention and healthy life-
styles.

own lives. That is over 7,000 veterans a

PLIGHT OF PUERTO RICO
(Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois asked and

House for 1 minute.)
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker,
tomorrow, at a hearing examining
Puerto Rico’s Financial Oversight
Board, I plan to stand strong with the
Puerto Rican families I represent and
demand to hear the board’s plan for re-
versing Puerto Rico’s plight.
At a time that families are leaving
the island, schools are closing, and
homes and communities destroyed by
Hurricane Maria still have not been re-
built, the fiscal board is forcing Puerto
Ricans to sacrifice pensions, wages,
and crucial government services.
People are hungry, using plastic
tarps as roofs, and living without elec-
tricity or heat.
I toured the devastated areas earlier
this year and met with families in my
district whose relatives are still suf-
fering last week.
Well over a year after Maria, less
than 20 percent of the aid that the fis-
cal board anticipated has been deliv-
ered.
How can Puerto Rico recover while
its oversight board continues to
squeeze the island and President
Trump continues to block disaster aid
and food stamps?
Tomorrow, I will stand with our
brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico and
demand answers to these questions.

FOUR PILLARS FOR AN
INFRASTRUCTURE DEAL
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-

Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, House
Democrats have an opportunity to cre-
ate substantive, innovative, and cost-
effective legislation that will bring
jobs and economic growth to America
through an infrastructure bill.
As co-chair of the New Democratic
Coalition’s Infrastructure Task Force,
we are actively drafting policy prior-
ities to be considered for a House infra-
structure bill. It is important to have
Americans of all sectors’ voices as we
do this, and last week the infrastruc-
ture listening sessions were hosted by
Representatives COLIN ALLRED and
MARC VEASEY in Dallas and JOE
CUNNINGHAM in Charleston.
New Democrats are intensely focused
on receiving and implementing for-
ward-looking and practical ideas to
help everyday Americans use infra-
structure that supports job creation
and advancement, multiple forms of
transportation, policy proposals to
mitigate climate change, and stream-
line bureaucracy.
It is my hope that the President and
Republicans will join us as we focus on
four pillars for an infrastructure deal:
modernize America’s infrastructure
and seek new revenue, create an infra-
structure bank to finance the project,
create incentives for communities
most in need to finance those projects
through grant programs, and encour-
age innovation and reform through re-
sponsible regulatory streamlining and
the utilization of public-private part-
nerships that work.
Building and renovating roads,
bridges, ports, greener schools and hos-
pitals, and broadbands all need the sup-
port of Congress to advance the flow of
America’s goods and services. It is
what we need to do to keep our domi-
nance in the economy.

CLIMATE CHANGE IS OUR
PRESENT
(Mr. ROUDA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, climate
change isn’t a question of if or even
when. Climate change is not our fu-
ture. It is our present.
Kids with asthma are finding it hard-
er and harder to breathe on their walks
to school or to the playground. Raging
fires have reduced whole communities
to ash in my home State of California.
Rising seas threaten to swallow family
homes on the coast. Extreme weather
has devastated our country from the
coast of Puerto Rico to the coast of Or-
ange County.
So, it bears asking: What will it take
for politicians to see what the Amer-
ican people already know to be true?
Americans are already suffering from
climate change, and the threat to hu-
mankind grows every day.
In 2015, almost every country in the
world recognized the climate crisis and
signed the Paris Agreement. The
United States led the way.
In 2017, this administration abdicated
the throne of American global leader-
ship and joined Russia, Turkey, and
Iran in the cheap seats.
This administration failed to lower
carbon emissions and protect the
lungs, homes, and wallets of the Amer-
ican people.
The Climate Action Now Act de-
mands accountability from this White
House. It is an up-and-down vote on
whether the Members of this body sup-
port a livable future for humankind.
f
PAWNS
(Mr. RYAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, the workers
of the United States of America are
tired of being pawns in this big cor-
porate game.
President Trump came to my com-
munity and said: Don’t sell your house.
Don’t sell your house. We are going to
get these house prices back up.
And, since that time, we lost the sec-
ond shift at our General Motors plant;
and General Motors, on that same day
that the workers were walking out, an-
nounced they are building a new fac-
tory in Mexico.
President Trump said: Don’t sell
your house.
A few months later, General Motors
lays off the first shift. They tell the
workers 2 days after Thanksgiving.
And, just a couple of days ago, a
trucking company, Falcon Transport,
just outside of Youngstown, Ohio, their
workers get a text message—600 work-
ers get a text message at 8:00 on a Sat-
urday night: You lost your job.
We got bailout money for every bank
that wants one. Every savings and
loan, every corporation gets a tax cut
to the tune of $2.3 trillion, and no one
gives a damn about the workers.
If we can bail out the corporations
that have done everything wrong, we
can start helping the workers who have
done everything right.
f
CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL
(Mr. KILMER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, there is
no denying it, climate change is real,
and Congress has a moral obligation to
act.
The communities that I represent in
Washington State are already experi-
encing the impacts. Coastal Tribes are
in the process of trying to move to
higher ground. Changing ocean chem-
istry is impacting our marine life and
the industries that depend on it.
The Department of Defense has
called it a threat multiplier that
makes our world less safe.
And, today, Congress will take an im-
portant, tangible step toward address-
ing climate change by passing the Cli-
mate Action Now Act, a bill that reaf-
firms America’s commitment to the
Paris climate agreement and directs
the administration to develop a com-
prehensive plan to meet the significant
emission reductions that we as a Na-
tion, and nearly every Nation in the
world, committed to back in 2015.
We know that making progress is not
only about protecting our environ-
ment, but also about protecting our
economic interests and our national se-
curity.
The American people are not just de-
manding action, but leadership, to
counter the impacts of climate change.
This legislation is an important first
step toward meeting our long-term car-
bon emission goals, and I am proud to
cosponsor it and vote in favor of it.

PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION
OF H.R. 9, CLIMATE ACTION NOW
ACT
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, by di-
rection of the Committee on Rules, I
call up House Resolution 329 and ask
for its immediate consideration.
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 329
Resolved, That at any time after adoption
of this resolution the Speaker may, pursuant
to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the
House resolved into the Committee of the
Whole House on the state of the Union for
consideration of the bill (H.R. 9) to direct the
President to develop a plan for the United
States to meet its nationally determined
contribution under the Paris Agreement, and
for other purposes. The first reading of the
bill shall be dispensed with. All points of
order against consideration of the bill are
waived. General debate shall be confined to
the bill and shall not exceed 90 minutes, with
60 minutes equally divided and controlled by
the chair and ranking minority member of
the Committee on Foreign Affairs and 30
minutes equally divided and controlled by
the chair and ranking minority member of
the Committee on Energy and Commerce.
After general debate the bill shall be consid-
ered for amendment under the five-minute
rule. The bill shall be considered as read. All
points of order against provisions in the bill
are waived. No amendment to the bill shall
be in order except those printed in the report
of the Committee on Rules accompanying
this resolution. Each such amendment may
be offered only in the order printed in the re-

to the House with such amendments as may
have been adopted. The previous question
shall be considered as ordered on the bill and
amendments thereto to final passage with-
out intervening motion except one motion to
recommit with or without instructions.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. TED
LIEU of California). The gentleman
from Massachusetts is recognized for 1
hour.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, for
the purpose of debate only, I yield the
customary 30 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO),
pending which I yield myself such time
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts?
There was no objection.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on
Monday, the Rules Committee met and
reported a rule, House Resolution 329.
It provides for the consideration of
H.R. 9 under a structured rule that
makes 30 amendments in order.
It also provides for 90 minutes of gen-
eral debate, with the chair and the
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs controlling
60 minutes, and the chair and ranking
minority member of the Committee on
Energy and Commerce controlling 30
minutes.
Mr. Speaker, the measure we are con-
sidering today makes clear that under
this Democratic majority science is
once again respected here in the House
of Representatives, that facts matter,
and that the word of the fossil fuel
lobby is not going to rule the day, be-
cause there is no debate on our side
about something as basic as climate
change.
The evidence is overwhelming. It is
happening, Mr. Speaker, and human
beings are playing a defining role.
Now, you don’t have to take my word
for it. You can ask virtually any sci-
entist working in the field today, be-
cause 97 percent of all climate sci-
entists agree that it is happening—97
percent.
There is a United Nations body
charged with looking at the science
here called the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change.
Do you know what it has found? That
the evidence is unequivocal.
The facts are as clear as day.
But you don’t even need to read the
report to know that something is hap-
pening here. Just look out your win-
dow. Once-in-a-generation hurricanes
are becoming commonplace; record-
breaking storms are becoming the
norm; and drastic temperature swings
are now just the way it is.
My district is home to more than
1,800 farms, and I visit with farmers
often. Climate change isn’t just an
issue on their minds; it is sometimes
the top issue on their minds when they
are asked about the challenges that
they face.
These farmers have told me about
how heat waves disrupt what was once
a reliable growing season and how un-
expected frosts have completely wiped
out their crops. Rainfall that once ran
like clockwork has given way to
droughts that could wipe out their en-
tire profits.
They don’t question what is going on.
They are not debating the science of
whether climate change is real. They
know. They know.
b 1230
They can see it, seemingly every day
as it impacts their livelihoods. I wish
the Republicans took climate change
as seriously. But instead of treating it
as a threat, they treat it as a punch
line.
A Republican Senator once brought a
snowball onto the Senate floor, trying
to prove that climate change isn’t real
because it still snows sometimes. You
can’t make this stuff up.
Just the other day, President Trump
mocked clean energy by suggesting
that windmills cause cancer. Are you
kidding me? That is the President of
the United States.
I won’t pretend to know what goes on
in the President’s head, but I know
this: His announcement in June 2017
that he would be pulling the United
States out of the Paris climate agree-
ment was indefensible.
This agreement set an ambitious goal
of keeping warming below 2 degrees
Celsius and established binding com-
mitments for countries to meet to re-
duce emissions. It recognized climate
change is a global problem that re-
quires a global solution.
If the President gets his way and ac-
tually withdraws the United States, we
would stand alone as one of the only
nations in the world not to be part of
it. Even Syria, a nation embroiled in
war, announced that it would sign on.
Thankfully, we are not out of it yet,
but we could be starting as early as
2020.
H.R. 9 would ensure the President
wouldn’t get his way by requiring him
to develop a plan to meet our commit-
ments under the Paris Agreement.
It is called the Climate Action Now
Act because we can’t wait, Mr. Speak-
er. Climate change isn’t some far-off
threat. It is not a problem for our
great-grandchildren or even our grand-
children to solve. It is our problem. It
is here today, impacting our Nation
and our future.
It is not just about the weather. Cli-
mate change also negatively impacts
public health and our national secu-
rity. Experts have even developed a
new term to describe those displaced
by its destructive impacts, ‘‘American
climate refugees.’’
This is not the time for handwringing
or indecisiveness and not the time to
let the fossil fuel industry that funds
some campaigns outweigh the facts. It
is certainly not the time for more
stunts or snowballs on the floor.
This is the time to act boldly, to lis-
ten to what the scientists are telling
us, and to protect our planet for future
generations. That is what H.R. 9 is all
about.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3352 May 1, 2019
I ask my colleagues to let the facts
rule the day once again in the people’s
House of Representatives. Let’s sup-
port this rule and the underlying legis-
lation and send an undeniable message
that, under this majority, we value
science and recognize the urgent need
to act on climate change.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Chairman MCGOVERN for yielding me
the customary 30 minutes, and I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, we find ourselves on the
floor, yet again, to consider a rule for
a piece of legislation that is nothing
more than another messaging bill
against the President of the United
States.
This new Democratic majority has
spent nearly 20 percent—20 percent—of
the time debating bills on the floor
that are nonbinding messaging pieces
of legislation. H.R. 9 is just another ex-
ample of this majority’s intent on mes-
saging against the President and the
lack of any true agenda for the Amer-
ican people.
The reality is that we all want clean
air, clean water, and a healthy environ-
ment. Who doesn’t? However, this bill
isn’t the solution.
Addressing environmental policy
should not include extreme policies
like the Green New Deal, nor should it
involve binding ourselves to inter-
national agreements that put the
United States at a disadvantage to its
main security and economic competi-
tors in the world, and with no regard to
cost for American consumers and rate-
payers.
Republicans have a better approach.
We can protect our environment by
promoting policies favoring clean en-
ergy, like nuclear, hydropower, natural
gas, wind, solar, and carbon capture,
and removing barriers to the deploy-
ment of new technologies and innova-
tion.
The United States is already leading
the world in reducing greenhouse gas
emissions through innovation and
technological development. Between
2000 and 2014, in fact, the U.S. reduced
emissions more than 18 percent.
We should be focused on continuing
to reduce emissions, developing and ex-
porting clean energy technologies, and
making our communities more resil-
ient, all while ensuring affordable and
reliable energy prices and prioritizing
the consumer and American security
and prosperity.
We have serious questions concerning
costs, effectiveness, and the feasibility
of the U.S. commitments made by the
Obama administration under the Paris
Agreement 4 years ago. Even then-Sec-
retary of State Kerry noted during the
Paris negotiations that if the United
States cut its CO2 emissions to zero, it
would still not offset the emissions
coming from the rest of the world.
The Obama administration’s commit-
ments in Paris were made without a
clear plan to meet those promises,
without a full view of the costs to
American consumers, and, certainly,
without a strategy that had broad bi-
partisan support of Congress.
If H.R. 9 were enacted into law, it
would put the United States into a po-
sition where it could not enforce any
other country’s action and would put
us at a disadvantage.
I have heard from some of my Demo-
cratic colleagues that their energy
policies are good for consumers, that it
creates many jobs and benefits the
economy. When they argue this, they
point to States like California, with
their renewable energy mandates.
However, California finds itself in the
precarious situation where it actually
pays Arizona to take their energy. This
is not good energy or economic policy.
If Democrats were serious about solv-
ing big problems for the American peo-
ple, they would partner and work
across the aisle to find bipartisan solu-
tions that they knew would have a
chance to pass in the U.S. Senate and
be signed by the President.
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the
rule, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Before I yield to the gentleman from
Texas, let me make a couple of points.
First of all, just so the RECORD is
clear, under President Trump’s poli-
cies, which are now taking effect and
are now reversing some of the advances
that we made under previous adminis-
trations, basically, these policies have
consequences. In 2018, our emissions
rose by 3.4 percent. We are going in the
wrong direction.
When the gentlewoman talks about
all these other alternative energy
sources that are clean and green that
my Republican friends support, she ne-
glects to point out that this President
hasn’t seen a fossil fuel that he hasn’t
wanted to embrace. In fact, he wants to
go back and invest more in coal, which
is hard to believe, given all the sci-
entific evidence that exists about the
dangers of coal for our atmosphere.
There is no question where this
President is coming from. He doesn’t
believe in climate change, and that is
what is so shocking, that the whole
world, the scientific community all
over the world, has warned us time and
time again that this is a real problem,
and we have a President who doesn’t
believe it. It is stunning. It is stunning,
but that is what we are dealing with.
Basically, this is an attempt to try
to get us back on the right track, to
take this problem, which is already
having significant negative con-
sequences in our country, and do some-
thing about it.
It is time to come together and tell
the President, who doesn’t believe in
science, that science is real, that it is
something we ought to take seriously,
and that we ought to do something
about it.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT).
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, climate
change is already wreaking economic
and security havoc: deep freezes; an in-
credible 5 feet of water dumped on
Houston, Texas, by a hurricane; in
other areas, droughts, amazing
wildfires, and extensive disease.
What we need is alternative energy,
not Trump ‘‘alternative facts,’’ and de-
cisions that are based on science, not
on mythology. President Trump’s re-
jection of sound climate change facts
only makes Chinese clean energy great
again.
We need to lead on the road to clean
green energy, not get run over. Fight-
ing climate change is an existential
challenge, but it is also an amazing
economic opportunity. We can create
green jobs right here with technology
that is exported to the world, instead
of letting our international competi-
tors prevail.
Recommitting to the Paris climate
agreement is more than bipartisan. It
is joining 2,000 American businesses. It
is joining 23 States. It is joining cities
across America, like San Antonio and
Austin, that have already pledged that
they want climate action, not more
nonsense and climate denying.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Texas.
Mr. DOGGETT. It is joining 21 senior
Defense officials who identify climate
change action as a way to address a
major national security challenge.
President Trump continues to block
meaningful environmental action by
clogging the corridors of power with
fossil fuel industry cheerleaders. A
Green New Deal is an alternative to
the same old dirty deal threatening our
planet with dark money, where the
only thing green is that money clog-
ging and polluting our democracy.
Climate action does bear some costs,
but inaction has even greater costs.
Let’s embrace the simple truth that
preserving the Earth is worth it. Let’s
embrace an America that is leading on
a green economic revolution.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. SCALISE), my good friend
and the Republican whip.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank
my colleague from Arizona for yielding
and for leading on this issue for the
economy of the United States of Amer-
ica and for hardworking families.
If you look at what getting back in
the Paris accord would do, Mr. Speak-
er, it would wreck our economy in
many different ways.
The people hardest hit by the United
States getting back in the Paris accord
are the very people who don’t need to
be hit the most, those with the lowest
income in our country, because it
would increase energy costs. By out-
side estimates, this bill, complying
with the unachievable requirements
that they have in this bill, would cost
up to 2.7 million American jobs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3353
May 1, 2019
Those jobs wouldn’t just evaporate,
Mr. Speaker. Those jobs, ironically, if
we were to get back into the Paris ac-
cord, would go to China and India be-
cause China and India, according to the
accord, are exempt until 2030. They
don’t even have to comply.
By the way, why don’t we look at the
countries that are begging us to get
back into the Paris accord? Not one of
the countries in the entire European
Union is in compliance with the
unachievable targets set in the Paris
accord. In fact, France, which Paris is
in, is not even in compliance with the
target.
Then they tell us: Hey, America, why
don’t you come into this thing, this
disaster of an agreement that none of
the countries in Europe are in compli-
ance with?
Then you look at what it would do,
again, to wreck America’s economy.
Let’s talk about carbon emissions. If
this is really about carbon emissions,
like the Green New Deal and other
crazy ideas that would wreck the
American economy, get rid of fossil
fuels. You don’t have to fly around on
planes anymore. You don’t have to
worry about missing a flight because
there wouldn’t be any flights. That is
how ludicrous their ideas are, yet they
believe in them.
They all do this under the guise of
carbon emissions. As they say on the
other side, climate action does have
some cost. Let’s talk about that cost:
$250 billion in higher taxes, as well as
lower wages for American families.
You wonder why they are rioting in
the streets of France. In Paris, where
the accord was signed, they are having
riots over this radical idea. By the
way, again, they are not even in com-
pliance with it.
Then you look at where these jobs
would go. The jobs would go to China
and India, which are not only exempt,
Mr. Speaker, but those countries actu-
ally emit four or five times more car-
bon than we do here because we have
good environmental standards in
America.
b 1245
We have been decreasing our carbon
emissions in America. In fact, we have
decreased our carbon emissions down
to the level that they were at in the
year 2000.
We are doing it not by signing some
radical job-killing accord; we are doing
it through American ingenuity, some-
thing we have always celebrated in this
country, something that we are the
world leader at.
Why would we want to give that ad-
vantage away? And not just giving it
away in the name of saving the planet,
giving it away to countries like China
and India, who are increasing carbon
emissions dramatically higher than us.
This is a disaster for our economy.
We need to reject this bad deal.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the
words from our distinguished minority
whip, but I would point out that the
cost of climate inaction will far out-
weigh the cost associated with acting
now.
According to the Fourth National
Climate Assessment, by 2090, lost
wages will reach $155 billion, mortality
from extreme temperatures will sur-
pass $140 billion, and coastal property
damage will approach $120 billion. All
told, the U.S. economy could lose more
than 10 percent of its GDP under the
worst-case scenario.
So people can deny that this is a
problem all they want, but they do so
at great economic risk for our country
and for other economies around the
world.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentlewoman from Washington
(Ms. DELBENE).
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, I rise
in support of H.R. 9, the Climate Ac-
tion Now Act.
Washington’s First District is home
to some of our Nation’s most beautiful
parks, mountains, and waterways, and
we are already seeing the consequences
of climate change:
Snowpack in the north Cascades is
currently 20 to 40 percent below normal
amounts;
Last year, wildfires ravaged the West
Coast, resulting in poor air quality and
public health issues;
Washington State just had the sec-
ond driest March on record, and there
is a greater likelihood of more fires
through the summer.
This is why Congress must take ac-
tion and pass H.R. 9. We need to be
moving forward, not backward.
President Trump’s statement of in-
tent to withdraw from the Paris cli-
mate agreement is a grave mistake
that would have lasting effects on our
planet and our economy.
H.R. 9 is an important step forward,
ensuring the United States upholds our
commitments under the agreement and
leads in the green economy.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the rule and
the underlying legislation.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
4 minutes to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. COLE), my good friend and
the ranking member of the Rules Com-
mittee.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I thank
my very good friend, Mrs. LESKO, for
yielding.
Well, we are here again, Madam
Speaker, on yet another bill that isn’t
going to pass the Senate, isn’t going to
become law, and doesn’t really do any-
thing.
As they have done over and over
again over the past few months, my
Democratic friends seem content to
bring up virtue-signaling messaging
bills as a substitute for passing real bi-
partisan legislation to solve problems
facing the American people.
Today’s bill purports to force the
President to return the United States
to the Paris Agreement on climate
change, never mind that he hasn’t ac-
tually pulled the United States from
that agreement yet, nor can he until
the day after the next Presidential
election in 2020. But on that day, to be
fair, I think he will.
Ineffective though it may be, the bill
does nothing to address the serious
fundamental flaws in the Paris Agree-
ment, nor does it offer any substantial
legislation to consider the problem of
our own changing climate.
Instead, like many other bills the
majority has offered in Congress, to-
day’s legislation is all talk, no action.
It is simply another messaging bill to
allow the majority to go on record in
opposition to President Trump. That is
not legislating.
Madam Speaker, it didn’t have to be
this way. We had an opportunity to im-
prove this bill both at the committees
of jurisdiction and again at the Rules
Committee this week, and we could
have made the bill better if we had
made more amendments from both
sides of the aisle in order for consider-
ation on the floor. Legislating is better
and more effective when all Members
can have their ideas considered before
final passage.
Making more amendments in order is
a pledge that we have heard time and
time again from my good friend and
my good chairman, Mr. MCGOVERN, so
it is unfortunate that this rule misses
a perfect opportunity to have robust
debate on ideas from both sides of the
aisle.
At the Rules Committee Monday
night, 91 amendments were proposed
and considered. Of those, 45 were pro-
posed by Democrats, 44 by Republicans,
and 2 were bipartisan. Of the 44 Repub-
lican amendments, 35 had no points of
order against them or any parliamen-
tary issues, yet when the final rule was
proposed and passed out of committee,
it made in order 30 amendments: 1 bi-
partisan amendment, 26 Democratic
amendments, and just 3 Republican
amendments.
Is that really how the majority wants
to operate going forward, 58 percent of
the Democratic amendments allowed
to come to the floor, but just 6 percent
of the Republican amendments and just
8 percent without points of order? That
is an abysmal result.
For example, my good friend RODNEY
DAVIS of Illinois proposed an amend-
ment that simply would have noted
that the 2018 farm bill is relevant to
achieving the goals of reducing green-
house gas emissions and would have re-
quired the President to add the Com-
mittee on Agriculture to any reports
he sends on this topic to the Foreign
Affairs and Energy and Commerce
Committees. This is a commonsense
amendment that takes into account
the role agriculture can play in reduc-
ing greenhouse gas emissions, yet the
amendment was blocked from consider-
ation on the floor.
What is the harm, I ask, in debating
that amendment here on the floor and

bringing our Nation’s farmers into the
discussion?
Dr. BURGESS, my fellow member of
the Rules Committee and a member of
the Energy and Commerce Committee,
submitted two amendments that re-
quired the President to consider how
carbon emission-free nuclear power and
other forms of renewable energy with
zero emissions, like hydropower, could
contribute to meeting the United
States’ obligation under the Paris
Agreement.
It seems logical to me that, when you
are seeking to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, using energy sources that
are emission-free makes sense, yet the
majority didn’t even want to discuss
that on the floor and blocked both of
Dr. BURGESS’ amendments. What harm
was there in discussing them?
I could go on and on, but the reality
is that the majority has used its power
at the Rules Committee to block con-
sideration of dozens of amendments
that could have and should have been
discussed on the floor.
When the Democrats took majority
control in the House, they promised a
more inclusive process with more mi-
nority voices heard, more Republican
amendments considered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. CAS-
TOR of Florida). The time of the gen-
tleman has expired.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
an additional 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE).
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding me addi-
tional time.
When the Democrats took majority
control of the House, they promised a
more inclusive process, more minority
voices heard, more Republican amend-
ments considered. If today’s action is
any indication, we have a long way to
go in making that promise a reality.
Instead, we are moving forward with a
deeply flawed bill that could and
should have been improved through the
amendment process.
I have been a member of the Rules
Committee for a long time, including
many years in the majority. It is fair
to ask: How did we do when we were in
the majority? Let’s look at the record.
In the 115th Congress, under Repub-
lican control of the Rules Committee,
45 percent of the amendments made in
order were Democratic, 38 percent were
Republican, 17 percent were bipartisan.
The statistics for today’s rule is a far
cry from the fairness of that record.
If the majority truly wants to ad-
dress the environment and wants to
legislate, then we can all certainly do
better than the bill before us today,
and we can do better than the process
we saw with this bill. All Members
should have an opportunity to be
heard, and we should all have an oppor-
tunity to make the bill better today.
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to
the rule and the underlying legislation.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, let me just say to
my ranking member, whom I have
great respect for, that I think we al-
ways need to figure out a way to do
better and to be more accommodating,
and I will continue to work with him
to try to do that. But I will point out
for the record that the committee has
made in order 30 amendments, a total
of 31 pages of amendments on a 6-page
bill.
I think we have a long way to go to
achieve the record of closed rules that
the previous Congress had, well over
100 closed rules. That broke, I think,
every closed rule record in history. We
certainly don’t want to get there, but
we need to continue to figure out ways
we can be more accommodating, and he
has my word that I will do that.
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes
to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms.
PINGREE).
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, I
thank Mr. MCGOVERN for his good work
and for yielding me the time.
Greenhouse gas emissions did not
happen in isolation. They have wide-
spread impact and will not be curbed
without global coordination. The
Obama administration understood that
fact, and that is why they entered
America into an international compact
to curb emissions on a global scale.
When the Trump administration re-
treated from the Paris accord last
year, it meant the effects of climate
change would only get worse in my
home State of Maine. In Maine, cli-
mate change isn’t an abstraction, it is
not a silly floor debate that has no
meaning. It is a very real threat to our
economy and to our way of life.
I recently met with farmers in my
State who told me climate change is
here now and we need real solutions to
adapt and to mitigate.
I met with climate scientists from
the University of Maine who told me
invasive species are threatening the
livelihoods of our foresters.
I also met with shellfish growers and
harvesters who are grappling with the
effects of ocean acidification, of ex-
treme weather events, and of the very
real fact that the Gulf of Maine is
warming faster than 95 percent of the
Earth’s other waters.
This is real, and I don’t want my
grandchildren looking back and saying:
‘‘Why didn’t Congress fix the problem
when they could?’’
H.R. 9 is the first piece of positive
climate change legislation to receive a
vote in the House in years. The bill will
reaffirm America’s commitment to
fighting climate change and will put
this Congress on a course to take on
the climate crisis before it is too late.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
3 minutes to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. NEWHOUSE), my good
friend.
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman from Arizona
for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition
to the rule that is before us today. As
Democrats in the House bring forward
legislation in the name of supporting
the environment and climate, I would
like to talk a little bit about the proc-
ess.
My good friend Chairman MCGOVERN
and the Democratic majority of the
House Rules Committee received a
total of 91 amendments submitted for
consideration on the legislation that
we have before us, and as you just
heard from Mr. COLE, of the 45 Demo-
cratic amendments, more than half
were made in order, 26 of those; but of
the 44 Republican amendments sub-
mitted for consideration, only 3—let
me repeat that—3 of those were made
in order.
Myself, I offered 2 of those 44 amend-
ments. They were noncontroversial.
They were ruled germane to the legis-
lation before us by the House Parlia-
mentarian, and all they did, simply,
was recognize the clean, renewable ben-
efits of hydropower and the clean emis-
sions-free benefits of nuclear power,
but Chairman MCGOVERN and his com-
mittee refused to allow this recogni-
tion.
So we have got to ask ourselves,
Madam Speaker:
Why? Why, if we are supposedly here
to debate policy affecting our environ-
ment and our climate, why would they
not want to discuss the clean energy
that comes from hydroelectric dams
like those in my district along the Co-
lumbia and Snake Rivers?
Why would they not want to discuss
the emissions-free energy produced by
nuclear power plants like the Columbia
Generating Station in my district in
central Washington.
It is because the efforts put forward
by Democrats in the House, be it the
flawed Paris agreement legislation
that is before us or the radical Green
New Deal proposal—which, I might
add, has no mention of hydropower and
actually calls for the end of nuclear
power in our Nation—have nothing to
do with science and everything to do
with politics.
The majority party, the Democrats,
with these proposals, is more focused
on pushing a mandated top-down sys-
tem that will inevitably do nothing to
help our environment.
What we should be doing, and what
my Republican colleagues continue to
advocate for, is focusing on the free
market approach spurred by collabora-
tion and innovation between our na-
tional laboratories, research univer-
sities, Federal partners, and the pri-
vate sector.
Madam Speaker, I would say to my
friend Mr. MCGOVERN that, when Re-
publicans were in the majority, we
made a conscientious effort on the
Rules Committee to provide equitable
treatment of amendments offered to
legislation. With the process before us
today, it is disappointing to see the
chairman not following in that good
faith effort, and I would urge a ‘‘no’’
vote.

May 1, 2019
b 1300
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, oh my God, just lis-
tening to the gentleman from Wash-
ington State give his remarks. He was
on the Rules Committee when the Re-
publicans were in charge last time and
voted for a record number of 103 closed
rules. That meant that not a single
amendment, Republican or Democrat,
could be made in order. Never once,
never once, did I hear him express res-
ervation about the historic closed proc-
ess that the Republicans embraced.
And as far as his amendment goes, as
the gentleman knows, the Paris cli-
mate agreement operates under the
theory that parties should be able to
satisfy their compliance plans any way
they choose. There are neither pre-
ferred nor prohibited ways to reduce
emissions.
Since the Paris Agreement is fuel
and technology neutral, we think this
bill should be too. But I just find it
hard to sit here and to listen with any
level of seriousness to the gentleman’s
complaints. When he was on the Rules
Committee, they broke every record in
the history of Congress being the most
closed Congress in the history of our
country. Can we do better? Yes, we can,
and we should do better.
But I will remind the gentleman,
again, that there were 30 pages of
amendments made in order on a 6-page
bill, a bill, by the way, that the gentle-
woman, Mrs. LESKO, said is not a seri-
ous bill anyway. So, I am not quite
sure what the messaging is here: that
it is not serious or that it is serious
enough where we need to have more
amendments. I can’t quite figure their
logic out here.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentlewoman from the District of
Columbia (Ms. NORTON).
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding, and
I thank him for his important work on
this urgent bill.
It is too late to overstate the ur-
gency of the climate crisis. It has al-
ready assumed emergency status in
parts of the world, including parts of
States like Florida.
The threatened withdrawal of the
U.S. from the Paris climate accord
should be considered an international
crime. The United States is the only
nation to threaten to withdraw from
the agreement, but others, such as
Brazil, seem willing to follow our lead.
I am encouraged, though, that in our
country, even though we have record
polarization today, Americans over-
whelmingly want the United States to
remain in the agreement. The absurd-
ity of sealing our own fate by faking
blindness to the climate catastrophe is
not lost on the American people we
represent. This is the most serious
issue faced by the Congress of the
United States in our history. We must
vote for the life, not the end of the
planet.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. KELLY), my good friend.
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for
yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in
strong opposition to H.R. 9.
Madam Speaker, if we are really
going to speak about what makes
sense, what doesn’t make sense, or
what does have a relevance, let’s not
forget about who bears the brunt of the
cost of what we are talking about. It is
hardworking Americans.
I find it interesting that we talk
about: Well, do you know what, you
guys did stuff the last time that pre-
vented us from getting amendments in,
so we are following along with the
same thing. I have great respect for the
chairman of the Rules Committee, but
I have to say that if the whole purpose
of this is what I think it is, then I
would like to go back to the actual be-
ginning where this should have been
treated as a treaty and it should have
gotten the advice and consent of the
Senate. Why did President Obama not
do that? Obviously, he did it because he
couldn’t get the advice and consent of
the Senate, so he decided to do it this
way.
If our whole job in coming to the peo-
ple’s House is to defend the American
people, then we need to take a real
long look at what it is that we are try-
ing to defend. This bill today is a mes-
saging bill, there is no question about
it.
If you look at the damage that could
be done to the American people—I am
talking about the American people
now, not a philosophy that is out there,
not an agenda that is out there, but I
am talking about hardworking Ameri-
cans: a loss of nearly 400,000 jobs—this
is according to the Heritage Founda-
tion—an average manufacturing loss of
over 200,000 jobs, a total income loss of
more than $20,000 per family, a GDP
loss of over $2.5 trillion, and increases
in household electricity expenditures
between 13 percent and 20 percent. The
biggest offenders in the world are
China and India, and they aren’t part
of this so-called agreement.
If we are really concerned about pro-
tecting the people who sent us here to
be their voice, then we ought to look at
what their voice is and who bears the
burden of a philosophy, a failed philos-
ophy, that has no chance of working
itself into law. We know that, and yet
today we will come here, and we will
rail against something that isn’t really
on the list of what the American people
have the greatest concerns over.
The people who I represent back in
Pennsylvania, they thank me every
day for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act be-
cause it has reduced their utility bills.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, let me just remind
my colleagues that the impact on our
economy is astronomical if we do noth-
ing. We are already seeing the negative
impacts on our economy because of cli-
mate change. It is hard to believe that
we are having a debate on the floor of
the House of Representatives where
people are denying that climate change
is a real threat or that our constitu-
ents somehow don’t care about this
issue, which they do.
And just one other thing. I want to
make sure that the RECORD is clear on
process. This bill went through two
committee hearings—Foreign Affairs
and Energy and Commerce—and two
markups before it went to the Rules
Committee where we granted a struc-
tured rule and we are having a debate
here on the floor. That is called regular
order. I know some of my Republican
friends don’t know what regular order
is, because when they were in charge
bills routinely came to the Rules Com-
mittee that bypassed committees of ju-
risdiction and then were closed up and
sent to the floor with no amendments
at all.
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes
to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.
SCHAKOWSKY), the distinguished chair-
woman of the Energy and Commerce
Subcommittee on Consumer Protection
and Commerce.
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
I thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
the rule and the underlying bill.
Climate change is the greatest, the
greatest, and most urgent challenge of
our time and this government should
never put corporate profits and those
kinds of concerns ahead of the health
and safety of our children and our fu-
ture.
Climate change isn’t just a Demo-
cratic or a Republican issue. It is an
existential issue for our species on this
planet.
I am hearing so many mischaracteri-
zations of what the Paris accord is.
These standards that are applied to the
United States are not from the outside,
not coming from across the pond. We
agree to reduce carbon emissions on
our own terms. Every country develops
its own plan and its own program.
This issue about jobs is just ridicu-
lous. Everyone understands that our
future is not in the fossil fuel industry.
The future is in the green technologies
that are being developed by entre-
preneurs. Young people get it. The 21st
century jobs of the future are clean
technologies that make sure our planet
is good and that entrepreneurs can ac-
tually succeed.
The costs of not doing this right now
are so enormous. We are seeing, prac-
tically every year, what are called 500-
year floods. They are only supposed to
happen once every 500 years, and now
we are seeing State after State, in my
own Midwest, under water, and it hap-
pens all the time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield an additional 30 seconds to the
gentlewoman.

Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. What is the cost
that we are bearing in all of our States
and at the Federal level to mitigate
the problems that are caused by cli-
mate change? And I want to just say to
my colleagues: These words are on the
RECORD. You might want to consider
not embarrassing your children and
your grandchildren and future genera-
tions of yours with making the kinds
of statements you are.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from South
Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN), my good friend.
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to oppose the rule and the under-
lying legislation that is both ill-ad-
vised and misguided.
The environment in the United
States isn’t getting dramatically worse
as those on the other side claim. We
are using more while actually reducing
air pollutants.
The total emissions of the six major
air pollutants has dropped by 68 per-
cent since 1970. This is a feat no other
country has accomplished.
How did we do this? These milestones
have been reached due to free-market
innovation and technological advances
only possible in a capitalistic society.
This is how to solve problems, not
through disastrous plans like the Paris
climate accord that imposes burden-
some and costly regulations not ap-
proved by Congress. Remember that:
not approved by Congress.
The accord, which was negotiated
unilaterally by the Obama administra-
tion with little congressional over-
sight, was flawed in both process and
substance. The Obama administration
skipped the ratification process in the
Senate and tied the American people’s
hands through executive power.
In fact, I offered an amendment in
committee to delay this legislation
until the Senate performed their con-
stitutional duty, but the other side
would rather send billions of taxpayer
dollars to other countries without con-
gressional approval. If the American
people are forced to put aside their per-
sonal needs in order to help the global
good, the Constitution should be fol-
lowed, and the Senate should perform
their proper role.
The substance of the Paris climate
accord was equally flawed and would
have significantly damaged the Amer-
ican economy. It is estimated that the
Paris climate accord would result in a
loss of 400,000 jobs, a total income loss
of $20,000 or more per family of four,
and an aggregate gross domestic prod-
uct loss of over $2.5 trillion.
While causing harm to the U.S. econ-
omy, the accord does nothing to hold
the biggest offenders of the emissions
accountable, nations like Russia and
China. Again, an amendment was of-
fered in committee to hold these na-
tions—Russia and China—to the same
standards the United States would be
held to and it was shot down by the
other side.
We can’t have effective climate pol-
icy that puts the United States at a
disadvantage to its main security and
economic competitors in the world.
This is not an America First agenda.
This legislation is more of a redistribu-
tion of wealth scheme than actual
sound environmental policy.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. DUNCAN. I think it is telling
when former U.N. climate official
Ottmar Edenhofer said regarding inter-
national climate policy, ‘‘We redis-
tribute de facto the world’s wealth by
climate policy.’’
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to defeat this rule and defeat
the underlying legislation.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
include in the RECORD a Washington
Post article entitled ‘‘Trump on cli-
mate change: ‘People like myself, we
have very high levels of intelligence
but we’re not necessarily such believ-
ers.’ ’’
[From the Washington Post, Nov. 27, 2018]
TRUMP ON CLIMATE CHANGE: ‘PEOPLE LIKE
MYSELF, WE HAVE VERY HIGH LEVELS OF
INTELLIGENCE BUT WE’RE NOT NECESSARILY
SUCH BELIEVERS’
(By Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker, Brady
Dennis and Chris Mooney)
President Trump on Nov. 26 reacted to a
major report issued Nov. 23 that said climate
change will challenge the economy, environ-
ment, and human health. (The Washington
Post)
President Trump on Tuesday dismissed a
landmark report compiled by 13 federal agen-
cies detailing how damage from global
warming is intensifying throughout the
country, saying he is not among the ‘‘believ-
ers’’ who see climate change as a pressing
problem.
The comments were the president’s most
extensive yet on why he disagrees with his
own government’s analysis, which found that
climate change poses a severe threat to the
health of Americans, as well as to the coun-
try’s infrastructure, economy and natural
resources. The findings—unequivocal, urgent
and alarming—are at odds with the Trump
administration’s rollback of environmental
regulations and absence of any climate ac-
tion policy.
‘‘One of the problems that a lot of people
like myself, we have very high levels of in-
telligence but we’re not necessarily such be-
lievers,’’ Trump said during a freewheeling
20-minute Oval Office interview with The
Washington Post in which he was asked why
he was skeptical of the dire National Climate
Assessment his administration released Fri-
day.
‘‘As to whether or not it’s man-made and
whether or not the effects that you’re talk-
ing about are there, I don’t see it,’’ he added.
Trump did not address the fundamental
cause of climate change. The president riffed
on pollution in other parts of the world. He
talked about trash in the oceans. He opined
on forest management practices. But he said
little about what scientists say is actually
driving the warming of the planet—emis-
sions of carbon dioxide from the burning of
fossil fuels.
‘‘You look at our air and our water and it’s
right now at a record clean. But when you
look at China and you look at parts of Asia
and you look at South America, and when
you look at many other places in this world,
including Russia, including many other
places, the air is incredibly dirty, and when
you’re talking about an atmosphere, oceans
are very small,’’ Trump said in an apparent
reference to pollution around the globe.
‘‘And it blows over and it sails over. I mean
we take thousands of tons of garbage off our
beaches all the time that comes over from
Asia. It just flows right down the Pacific. It
flows and we say, ‘Where does this come
from?’ And it takes many people, to start off
with.’’
Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at
Texas Tech University, said in an email
Tuesday that the president’s comments risk
leaving the nation vulnerable to the ever-
growing impacts of a warming planet. ‘‘Facts
aren’t something we need to believe to make
them true—we treat them as optional at our
peril,’’ Hayhoe said. ‘‘And if we’re the presi-
dent of the United States, we do so at the
peril of not just ourselves but the hundreds
of millions of people we’re responsible for.’’
Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric
sciences at Texas A&M University, struggled
to find a response to the president’s com-
ments. ‘‘How can one possibly respond to
this?’’ Dessler said when reached by email,
calling the president’s comments ‘‘idiotic’’
and saying Trump’s main motivation seemed
to be attacking the environmental policies
of the Obama administration and criticizing
political adversaries.
In his comments, Trump also seemed to in-
voke a theme that is common in the world of
climate-change skepticism—the idea that
not so long ago, scientists feared global cool-
ing, rather than the warming that is under-
way today.
‘‘If you go back and if you look at articles,
they talk about global freezing,’’ Trump
said. ‘‘They talk about at some point, the
planet is going to freeze to death, then it’s
going to die of heat exhaustion.’’
This may refer to an oft-cited 1975 News-
week article titled ‘‘The Cooling World’’ or a
1974 Time magazine story titled ‘‘Another
Ice Age?’’ But researchers who have reviewed
this period have found that while such ideas
were indeed afoot at the time, there was ‘‘no
scientific consensus in the 1970s’’ about a
global cooling trend or risk, as there is today
about human-caused climate change.
In other words, scientists’ understanding
of where the planet is headed, and the con-
sequences, is far more developed now than it
was in the 1970s.
At present, Earth has warmed roughly one
degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) above
late-19th-century, preindustrial levels. Mul-
tiple analyses have shown that without rapid
emissions cuts—well beyond what the world
is undertaking—the warming will continue
and could blow past key thresholds that sci-
entists say could lead to irrevocable climate-
related catastrophes, such as more-extreme
weather, the death of coral reefs and losses
of major parts of planetary ice sheets.
On Tuesday, a U.N. report underscored
again how the world is far off course on its
promises to cut greenhouse-gas emissions.
The report found that, with global emissions
still increasing as of 2017, it is unlikely they
will peak by 2020. Scientists have said carbon
emissions must fall sharply in coming years
if the world is to have a chance of avoiding
the worst consequences of climate change.
Trump also made reference to recent dev-
astating wildfires in California, which sci-
entists say have been made more intense and
deadly by climate change. But the president
instead focused on how the forests that
burned have been managed. Previously, he
has praised Finland for spending ‘‘a lot of
time on raking and cleaning’’ its forest
floors—a notion that left the Finnish presi-
dent flummoxed.

‘‘The fire in California, where I was, if you
looked at the floor, the floor of the fire, they
have trees that were fallen,’’ Trump said.
‘‘They did no forest management, no forest
maintenance, and you can light—you can
take a match like this and light a tree trunk
when that thing is laying there for more
than 14 or 15 months. And it’s a massive
problem in California.’’
‘‘You go to other places where they have
denser trees, it’s more dense, where the trees
are more flammable, they don’t have forest
fires like this because they maintain,’’ he
said. ‘‘And it was very interesting I was
watching the firemen, and they were raking
brush. . . . It’s on fire. They’re raking it,
working so hard. If that was raked in the be-
ginning, there would be nothing to catch on
fire.’’
Trump wasn’t the only administration offi-
cial on Tuesday to shrug off the federal gov-
ernment’s latest climate warnings. In a tele-
vision appearance in California, Interior Sec-
retary Ryan Zinke acknowledged that fire
seasons have grown longer in the state but
added, ‘‘Climate change or not, it doesn’t re-
lieve you of responsibility to manage the for-
est.’’
Meanwhile, asked Tuesday about the find-
ings of the nearly 1,700-page climate report
the administration released on Black Friday,
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders
echoed her boss.
‘‘We think that this is the most extreme
version and it’s not based on facts,’’ Sanders
said of the National Climate Assessment.
‘‘It’s not data-driven. We’d like to see some-
thing that is more data-driven. It’s based on
modeling, which is extremely hard to do
when you’re talking about the climate.
Again, our focus is on making sure we have
the safest, cleanest air and water.’’
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
do that because I want the RECORD to
reflect this President’s ignorance on an
issue that is not only of national con-
cern but of international concern.
In the past three annual worldwide
threat assessments, the U.S. intel-
ligence communities have cited cli-
mate change as a national security
threat and a multiplier of threats that
create instability, food and water
shortages, refugee and population mi-
gration, and economic disruption. This
is a matter that we can’t ignore any-
more. We need to pass this bill.
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes
to the gentlewoman from California
(Ms. JUDY CHU).
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam
Speaker, climate change is a crisis
that demands our immediate attention.
Its effects are ongoing. It will impact
all of us eventually, whether through
worse storms, bigger wildfires, less
food and water, or conflicts over re-
sources.
The good news is, we still have the
time and ability to halt the worst ef-
fects. That is what the Paris climate
agreement achieved. This landmark
agreement was the first ever to unite
195 countries around the common goal
of protecting our planet from the worst
impacts of our own actions. That is
why we must pass H.R. 9, to keep the
President from pulling us out of this
deal and require the administration to
develop concrete plans to meet our
emissions reduction targets.
Under the Paris Agreement, each
country agreed to meet our own goals
to keep global temperatures from rais-
ing more than 2 degrees Celsius. De-
spite Trump’s step backwards, I am
proud that my State of California
shows change can be made with com-
monsense steps.
Investments in important tech-
nologies like renewable energy, clean
cars, and green buildings mean that
California is on track to drop our emis-
sions to 80 percent of 1990 levels by
2050. Now the Federal Government
must follow.
The urgency of fighting climate
change cannot be in question. Neither
can our commitment to the Paris
Agreement. I urge passage of this bill.

Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, may I
inquire as to how many minutes I have
remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Arizona has 10 minutes
remaining. The gentleman from Massa-
chusetts has 11 minutes remaining.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman
from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER).
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I
thank my colleague for yielding me the
time.
Madam Speaker, it has been nearly 2
years since President Trump recklessly
announced the United States’ with-
drawal from the Paris climate accord.
We are now the only country in the
world not firmly behind this agree-
ment.
There are times where we must stand
alone. This is not one of them. Climate
change and its impacts are an existen-
tial threat, and American leadership
has an important role to play, but
under the Trump administration, we
are retreating from our responsibility
and giving up our seat at the table.
Two years ago, more than 180 Rep-
resentatives joined my resolution con-
demning President Trump’s withdrawal
from the Paris Agreement, but the Re-
publican leadership refused to let this
body vote its will. Today, that changes.
That is because this House is finally re-
flecting the will of the American peo-
ple, which, by a 5-to-1 margin, support
staying in the agreement.
We need to work with the rest of the
world, and the nations of the world are
looking to us to lead. Staying in the
Paris Agreement and developing a plan
to meet emission reduction targets
agreed to would be an important first
step.
As this House takes action to pass
H.R. 9, I hope the Senate will follow
our lead and promptly take up the leg-
islation, and I hope today’s vote—this
vote—represents just the first of many
efforts to reduce our greenhouse gas
emissions and prevent a global climate
disaster.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman
from Vermont (Mr. WELCH).
Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in support of H.R. 9, the Climate
Action Now Act.
Climate change is here, and it is
worth highlighting some of the impacts
that are underway.
This year, we have seen record flood-
ing in the Midwest, unprecedented
wildfires in the West, and record tem-
peratures across the country.
In Vermont—and talk about eco-
nomic impacts—the ski season is get-
ting shorter. In one study, it has noted
that, even under the most optimistic
climate change models, all the ski
areas in southern New England will no
longer be economically viable by 2040.
That would be thousands of jobs melt-
ing away as a result of climate change.
We have had 16 disasters in 2017 with
damage exceeding $1 billion, spending
$306 billion on weather-related disas-
ters that year.
Climate change is a priority for
young people and local officials. It now
must become a priority for Congress.
The Climate Action Now Act takes
an important step in this direction by
keeping us—or getting us back into the
Paris climate agreement and not taken
out by the action of a single person.
This bill is just the start of fulfilling
our obligations and our opportunity to
slow climate change.
Now, some folks are fearful about the
economic consequences of addressing
climate change, but a confident nation
faces its problems; it doesn’t deny
them. It is in facing these problems
that we are actually going to create
jobs, not lose jobs.
So, Madam Speaker, I commend Rep-
resentative CASTOR for her leadership
on this legislation. I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill as the be-
ginning of undertaking the opportunity
that we have economically to build a
stronger and safer environment.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. BROWNLEY).
Ms. BROWNLEY of California.
Madam Speaker, climate change is an
existential threat that requires the en-
tire international community to solve.
The Paris Agreement was a monu-
mental achievement, rightly praised
across the world and in Congress. The
President’s impulsive decision to pull
out of the agreement was one of the
most dangerous acts of his Presidency.
My district, Ventura County, knows
all too well the devastating economic
and human toll of climate change,
which has increased the frequency and
severity of deadly wildfires in our com-
munity.
Climate change is also a threat to
our national security and military
readiness.
I am the proud Representative of
Naval Base Ventura County, and I
know that climate change will increase
problems with coastal corrosion at our
Navy base and other U.S. military in-
stallations worldwide. In Ventura

As sea levels rise and the severity of

nately, House Democrats have recog-
nized these threats, and we have devel-
oped plans to address them through the
creation of the Select Committee on
the Climate Crisis, on which I proudly
serve.
The Climate Action Now Act is our
pledge to the world that many in the
United States Congress want our Na-
tion to be a global leader in solving
this crisis. I urge my Republican col-
leagues to vote to protect our chil-
dren’s and our grandchildren’s future
and our national security. I urge a
‘‘yes’’ vote on the rule and on the bill.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
include in the RECORD a letter from
leading public health advocates in sup-
port of H.R. 9, as well as a letter signed
by many of the leading environmental
organizations in support of this legisla-
tion.
APRIL 29, 2019.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: The undersigned
public health and medical organizations urge
you to support H.R. 9, the Climate Action
Now Act. The bill would help ensure that the
United States adheres to the science-based
targets in the Paris Agreement and develops
a plan to meet them, both essential steps to
protecting public health from the impacts of
climate change.
Climate change is a public health emer-
gency. The science clearly shows that com-
munities across the nation are experiencing
the health impacts of climate change, in-
cluding enhanced conditions for ozone and
particulate air pollution, which cause asth-
ma attacks, cardiovascular disease and pre-
mature death; increased instances of ex-
treme heat, severe storms and other desta-
bilizing weather patterns that disrupt peo-
ple’s access to essential healthcare; in-
creased spread of vector-borne diseases; and
longer and more intense allergy seasons.
These threats are no longer hypothetical,
and Americans across the country have expe-
rienced them firsthand.
Every American’s health is at risk due to
climate change, but some populations are at
greater risk, including infants, children, sen-
iors, pregnant women, low-income commu-
nities, some communities of color, people
with disabilities and many people with
chronic diseases. Evidence and experience
shows that these populations will dispropor-
tionately bear the health impacts of climate
change without concerted action to both
mitigate and adapt to climate change.
The science is also clear that limiting in-
crease in global temperatures to no more
than 1.5 degrees Celsius is essential. The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
found dramatic differences in health impacts
between 1.5 and 2 degrees, including in heat-
related morbidity and mortality, ozone-re-
lated mortality, and vector-borne diseases.
The Paris Agreement’s goals are to keep the
world well under 2 degrees Celsius and to
pursue efforts to further stay below 1.5 de-
grees.
H.R. 9 is an important step toward what
must become a comprehensive set of policies
protect public health from the worst impacts
of climate change. The nation urgently needs
to implement strong, science-based measures
to reduce the emissions that cause climate
change. The U.S. must also invest in health
adaptation strategies to help communities
address the varied health impacts they are
already facing.
On behalf of the patients and communities
we serve, we urge you to vote YES on H.R. 9,
the Climate Action Now Act.
Sincerely,

Nurses for Healthy Environments, American
Lung Association, American Public Health

APRIL 29, 2019.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of our
millions of members and supporters across
the country, we urge you to support H.R. 9,
the Climate Action Now Act, to ensure the
U.S. meets its commitments under the Paris
Agreement and to reinforce our national re-
solve to address climate change.
The Paris Agreement is a global response
to the greatest environmental challenge of
our time. It includes, for the first time, spe-
cific commitments from all major countries
and a pathway for each country to strength-
en its own domestic climate actions in the
years ahead. United States leadership and
participation was crucial in bringing the
world together to act. But now, by threat-
ening to exit the agreement, the Trump ad-
ministration risks isolating itself, under-
mining global climate action, and weakening
America’s international influence on a broad
array of critical foreign policy issues.
Americans are experiencing climate
change here and now in a rising tide of ex-
treme weather disasters, from hurricanes in
the southeast, to wildfires in the west, to
flooding right now in the country’s heart-
land. It’s no surprise that polls consistently
show that concern over the climate crisis is
rising across generational, geographic, and
partisan lines.
Americans’ personal experience is under-
scored by a raft of new scientific reports.
Last fall the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) confirmed that cli-
mate change is already happening, and ambi-
tious action to curb carbon pollution is need-
ed starting now to stave off steadily wors-
ening impacts in the U.S. and across the
globe. The last four years have been the hot-
test on record since global measurements
began in 1880, according to the National Oce-
anic and Atmospheric Administration and
the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration. And the National Climate Assess-
ment—prepared by 13 federal agencies and
released by the Trump Administration last
year—lays out the stark reality of current
climate impacts in all regions of the nation
and projects how much worse they could get.
Without significant global action, the Na-
tional Climate Assessment concludes: ‘‘ris-
ing temperatures, sea level rise, and changes
in extreme events are expected to increas-
ingly disrupt and damage critical infrastruc-
ture and property, labor productivity, and
the vitality of our communities.’’ ‘‘[C]oastal
economies and property are already at risk,’’
especially communities disproportionately
comprised of low-income and minority
Americans. In short, climate change is al-
ready here in America and it’s already harm-
ing Americans’ lives.
Despite these dire forecasts, we can still
stave off the worst effects of climate change.
Congressional leadership is more important
than ever, and the Climate Action Now Act
will go a long way to ensure that the United
States fulfills our commitments under the
Paris Agreement and stays on the path to se-
rious action on climate change.
This legislation demonstrates leadership
and vision needed to tackle the climate cri-
sis. We urge you to support the Climate Ac-
tion Now Act to help make the future cli-
mate safe for our children and grandchildren
and honor America’s commitments to help
confront this global challenge.

Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN).
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now
Act.
The simple fact of the matter is that
climate change is real, and it is cre-
ating enormous consequences for the
United States. It is a threat to coast-
lines and property values, to public
health, and to our economy.
But it is also affecting our military
readiness, our national security, and it
is changing the strategic environment
in which our country and our troops
operate. That is why I added language
to the fiscal year 2018 National Defense
Authorization Act making it clear that
Congress acknowledges climate change
is a threat to our national security.
My amendment also requires the De-
partment of Defense to assess the mili-
tary bases most threatened by climate
change, including an analysis of future
costs of how to deal with and mitigate

those challenges. Only through sober
and rigorous analysis can we recognize
the true cost of climate change to
American strength and capabilities.
Madam Speaker, it is absolutely im-
perative that we address the impacts of
climate change now, and we have more
work to do. This year, on the Armed
Services Committee, we will continue
to require the Pentagon to better as-
sess and report on the climate threat.
Madam Speaker, the Climate Action
Now Act is about honoring our global
commitments. As Americans, we rise
to meet our challenges; we do not hide
from them. We solve problems. We de-
velop new technologies, and we inno-
vate to create a more sustainable
world. That is our Nation’s proud herit-
age, and that is the spirit that we
should bring toward engaging this cli-
mate threat.
The Paris Agreement was crafted
through the work of American nego-
tiators with other countries around the
world. It was signed by an over-
whelming 174 countries, plus the Euro-
pean Union. This agreement represents
a clear consensus to get serious and
combat climate change.
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill. The threat
is real. Time is of the essence. The
time to act is now.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to provide additional
consideration of H. Res. 109, the noto-
rious Green New Deal.
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous
consent to insert the text of my
amendment in the RECORD, along with
extraneous material, immediately
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Arizona?
There was no objection.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, it is
about time that the American people
know where Members of Congress stand
on this radical proposal of the Green
New Deal, which will change nearly
every aspect of Americans’ lives. Even
the sponsor of this legislation has re-
quested hearings on this proposal since
the Speaker and the Democratic lead-
ership refuse to give the Green New
Deal any legislative hearings. I would
like to lay out some of it here.
Estimations show energy bills under
the Green New Deal would spike by as
much as $3,800 per year, per family.
The resolution calls for upgrading
all—all—existing buildings in the
United States and constructing new
buildings to achieve maximal energy
efficiency, which could range between
$1.6 trillion, with a t, and $4.2 trillion
in cost.
What is the estimated total price tag
for the Green New Deal? Up to $93 tril-
lion. That is with a t, trillion dollars.
So where is this money going to
come from? The Green New Deal could
cost nearly $65,000 per year, per house-
hold, much higher than the average
family income.
We have seen the Democratic major-
ity bring messaging bill after mes-
saging bill to the floor. Why not this
one? Why not the Green New Deal?
Why not truly let the American people
know where the Democrats stand on
what I believe is a radical proposal
that will hurt our Nation and kill jobs?
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. HICE),
my good friend.
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, I thank my good friend, Mrs. LESKO,
for yielding some time.
H.R. 9 is an attempt simply to force
the President to reenter an ineffectual
international agreement, one that
pushes the United States to adopt bur-
densome, painful measures and hold us
to a standard that no other country
that is a part of the agreement has
bothered to meet themselves, all to do
something that we are already doing,
and that is lowering greenhouse gas
emissions.
But H.R. 9 is not the real agenda of
our Democratic colleagues. To under-
stand what the real Democratic Party
wants to do, one need look no further
than H. Res. 109, better known as the
Green New Deal.
Look, people in my district are not
asking where I stand or what I think
about the Paris climate agreement, but
they are asking, eagerly, where I stand
on the Green New Deal. Everywhere I
go, people are asking about it.
Last night, on a telephone townhall,
several questions were asking where I
stood on this. They are concerned that
their Representative might support a
proposal that would drastically in-
crease their energy bills.
And businesses I talk to want to
know whether or not I would support
what amounts to a torrent of heavy-
handed regulations.
I assure you, as I did them, that I do
not. I strongly oppose the Green New
Deal, but I cannot say the same for my
colleagues across the aisle.
Madam Speaker, 92 Democrats have
cosponsored the Green New Deal, and
nearly every Democrat running for
President has endorsed it. It seems
clear that this really is the new policy
platform for the Democratic Party.
I know that many of my Democratic
colleagues disagree with me. They be-
lieve strongly in the policies of the
Green New Deal, and I am sure some of
their constituents would agree as well.
But I am also positive that their con-
stituents, Democratic constituents,
want to know where their Representa-
tive stands on this issue just as much
as mine want to know where I stand.
So let’s have a vote.
But let’s be frank with each other.
The Speaker would not allow a re-
corded vote. Speaker PELOSI knows
very likely that to have a vote on the
Green New Deal could cost the Demo-
crats the majority.
So, look, here is the deal. We Repub-
licans are more than happy to go on
record with our opposition to the
Green New Deal, and we are more than
happy to help our Democratic col-
leagues go on record with their support
for the Green New Deal. So help us de-
feat the previous question.
As my friend, Mrs. LESKO, has said, if
we defeat the previous question, then
we will amend the rule and enable a
vote on the Green New Deal, and I hope
to have support in that regard.
But I understand it may be difficult
for some of my colleagues across the
aisle to do so, and if they are unable to
help support us on this previous ques-
tion, then I have another opportunity.
b 1330
If we do not defeat the previous ques-
tion immediately following this vote
series, I am going to file a discharge
petition to ensure a vote on the Green
New Deal. I encourage all Members
here to vote against the previous ques-
tion, vote against the rule, and sign
the discharge petition. Let’s have a
vote on the Green New Deal.
Again, I thank the gentlewoman for
yielding this time.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, in closing, we all
want to protect the environment, both
Republicans and Democrats, and en-
sure that we are leaving a better world
for on our children, grandchildren, and
future generations.
Unfortunately, H.R. 9 is not, in my
opinion, a legitimate solution. H.R. 9 is
little more than a messaging bill that
is intended to undermine the President
and message to the Democratic base.
We do have an opportunity to get
things done here, but it takes a will-
ingness from those in power to work
with us in a bipartisan fashion for a so-
lution.
Republicans want to focus on clean
and affordable energy solutions that
will create stability for consumers at
affordable rates. We should be working
together on these solutions and on real
pieces of legislation that have the abil-
ity to pass the U.S. Senate and be
signed by the President.
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote
on the previous question and a ‘‘no’’
vote on the underlying measure, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker,
how much time do I have remaining?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts has 41⁄2
minutes remaining.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
This is like the theater of the absurd,
when I listen to my Republican col-
leagues. We have a bill, H.R. 9, that
says that the United States should not
remove itself from the Paris climate
accord. I have one colleague saying
that it is a messaging bill that means
nothing. I have other Republican col-
leagues saying that if we pass this, it is
the end of the world because it is going
to have all these implications.
Then we get lectured to by my Re-
publican colleagues for almost an hour

now that 30 amendments are not
enough on a 6-page bill, that we need
more and more amendments in order.
Then, the gentleman from Georgia
comes to the floor and says: I want to
offer the Green New Deal, and I want
to offer it under a closed rule where no-
body can amend it.
I mean, you can’t make this stuff up.
The Republicans are saying: We don’t
want hearings, and we don’t want
markups. We want nothing. We just
want to bring it to the floor under a
closed rule so that nobody, Democrats
or Republicans, can amend it.
I support the Green New Deal. I have
some ideas to make it a little bit bet-
ter. I would like to have some amend-
ments made in order. But my Repub-
lican friends say no amendments,
closed rule, shut it all down. Old habits
die hard.
When the Republicans were in
charge, they presided over the most
closed Congress in the history of our
country, and they just can’t break that
old habit.
Well, you know what? We want to
move on a Green New Deal, but we
want to do it right. We want to do
hearings, and you can have some of
your friends and allies who are cli-
mate-change deniers come to testify
against it if you want. We will bring
experts and scientists because we be-
lieve in science. We will have them
come to talk about why it is important
and how we can improve it.
We look forward to that, but not
under a closed rule with no hearings
and no markups. This is embarrassing.
Madam Speaker, the United States
has a unique role to play in fighting
climate change, not just because we
should be leading the way on innova-
tion or because we have the largest
economy anywhere but because we
played a major role in furthering this
crisis.
Between 1970 and 2013, the U.S.
ranked number one in total carbon
emissions. We released more carbon
into the atmosphere than China,
Japan, or any of the other 40 global na-
tions. That is according to the Emis-
sions Database for Global Atmospheric
Research. I don’t think we should be
turning our back on a problem that we
helped create.
It isn’t a radical or partisan idea. Ex-
perts consider 1988 to be the year that
the science behind climate change be-
came widely known and accepted, and
that is the year when a Republican
Presidential nominee, George H.W.
Bush, pledged that he would fight the
greenhouse effect with the ‘‘White
House effect.’’
We have come a long way since then,
Madam Speaker, and I don’t mean posi-
tively. There was a time when Repub-
licans cared about the environment,
when they understood that issues like
the climate crisis were something that
we needed to work on in a bipartisan
way. Now they have become the party
of climate change deniers.
This is the challenge of our genera-
tion. It is more important than petty
partisanship.
President Trump seems obsessed with
dismantling anything that Barack
Obama has ever done. That doesn’t
mean that Congress should sit idly by
when it comes at the expense of the fu-
ture of our planet.
With climate change, public health is
at risk and our national security is en-
dangered. The President may be un-
willing to rise to the challenge, but
this Democratic majority is not. Con-
gress shouldn’t let another one of his
temper tantrums ruin our planet.
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote
on the previous question, and I urge a
‘‘yes’’ vote on this rule and the under-
lying resolution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
The text of the material previously
referred to by Mrs. LESKO is as follows:
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 329
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing:
SEC. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this
resolution, the House shall proceed to the
consideration in the House of the resolution
(H. Res. 109) recognizing the duty of the Fed-
eral Government to create a Green New
Deal. The resolution shall be considered as
read. The previous question shall be consid-
ered as ordered on the resolution and pre-
amble to adoption without intervening mo-
tion or demand for division of the question
except one hour of debate equally divided
and controlled by the Majority Leader and
the Minority Leader or their respective des-
ignees. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not
apply to the consideration of House Resolu-
tion 109.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time, and
I move the previous question on the
resolution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on ordering the previous
question.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, on
that I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair
will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum
time for any electronic vote on the
question of adoption of the resolution.
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 228, nays

So the resolution was agreed to.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.

er, had I been present, I would have voted

RAISING A QUESTION OF THE
PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam
Speaker, I rise to offer a question of
the privileges of the House previously
noticed.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the resolution.
The Clerk read as follows:
H. RES. 304
Whereas Michael Cohen testified under
oath as a witness before the House Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform on February
27, 2019;
Whereas Michael Cohen falsely testified
under oath, ‘‘I have never asked for, nor
would I accept, a pardon from President
Trump’’;
Whereas in truth and fact, attorney for Mi-
chael Cohen, Lanny Davis, admitted on
March 6, 2019, that Cohen ‘‘directed his at-
torney to explore possibilities of a pardon at
one point with Donald J. Trump lawyer Rudy
Giuliani as well as other lawyers advising
President Trump’’;
Whereas in truth and fact, attorney for Mi-
chael Cohen, Michael Monico, admitted in a
March 12, 2019, letter that Cohen’s testimony
was inaccurate;
Whereas in truth and fact, the ex post rep-
resentation by Cohen’s attorney does not
annul Cohen’s intentionally false and mis-
leading testimony;
Whereas in truth and fact, Cohen’s testi-
mony under oath was delivered in the con-
text of apologizing for all his criminal ac-
tivities;
Whereas in truth and fact, Cohen’s denial
of ever seeking a pardon contained no quali-
fiers about the context of his statement;
Whereas in truth and fact, Cohen’s denial
of ever seeking a pardon, as uttered under
oath in his testimony, was absolute and un-
equivocal;
Whereas in truth and fact, Cohen testified
under oath that he and his lawyers spent
hours editing his written statement sub-
mitted to the Committee on Oversight and

Reform preceding his testimony, which in-
cluded the written assertion, ‘‘I have never
asked for, nor would I accept, a pardon from
President Trump’’;
Whereas in truth and fact, Cohen’s denial
in his written statement of never asking for
a Presidential pardon was an unqualified as-
sertion;
Whereas Michael Cohen falsely testified
under oath that he ‘‘did not want to go to
the White House’’ and he ‘‘did not want a
role or title in the administration’’;
Whereas in truth and fact the United
States Attorney’s Office for the Southern
District of New York submitted to Federal
court a sentencing memorandum expressing
Michael Cohen’s desire to work in the White
House, explaining: ‘‘during and after the
campaign, Cohen privately told friends and
colleagues, including in seized text mes-
sages, that he expected to be given a promi-
nent role and title in the new administra-
tion. When that did not materialize, Cohen
found a way to monetize his relationship
with and access to the President’’;
Whereas Michael Cohen falsely testified
under oath on other factual matters of mate-
rial significance;
Whereas Michael Cohen’s intentionally
false testimony was aimed at obscuring the
truth and ameliorating the extent of his own
personal embarrassment;
Whereas intentionally false testimony to a
committee of the House of Representatives
harms the integrity of the proceedings of the
House;
Whereas it is a Federal crime to provide
false information to Congress and the failure
to enforce this crime further undermines the
integrity of the House; and
Whereas it is the judgment of the House of
Representatives that providing a copy of the
official transcript of the hearing of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform on February
27, 2019, to the Department of Justice would
aid the Attorney General’s consideration of
investigation and potential prosecution of
Michael Cohen’s criminal conduct: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, that the House of Representatives
directs the chair of the Oversight and Re-
form Committee to submit to the Attorney
General an official copy of the transcript of
the hearing during which Michael Cohen tes-
tified under oath on February 27, 2019.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution qualifies.
MOTION TO TABLE
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I have
a motion at the desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion.
The Clerk read as follows:
Mr. HOYER moves that the resolution
be laid on the table.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion to table.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.

May 1, 2019
MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING
THE LIFE OF CONGRESSWOMAN
ELLEN TAUSCHER
(Ms. PELOSI asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise with
great sadness to mark the passing of a
leader of exceptional courage and firm
principles, our colleague and dear
friend, Congresswoman Ellen Tauscher.
The presence of so many members
from our California delegation is a
beautiful tribute to her beautiful life.
Thank you all for being here.
Ellen’s passing is a great official loss
to the people of California and to the
Nation and a deep personal loss for all
of us who are blessed to call her friend.
Our hearts break for her daughter,
Katherine. Personally, it was a joy for
many of us to see her expect Katherine.
Katherine came. Katherine is growing
up. She took such delight in being
Katherine’s mother.
Ellen was an extraordinary force for
progress who made a difference. Her
smart, strategic leadership strength-
ened our democratic institutions and
kept America safe, and her relentless
commitment to nuclear nonprolifera-
tion beautifully honored the oath we
take to support and defend the Con-
stitution and protect the American
people.
Ellen was a pioneer who made his-
tory when she became the youngest
ever and one of the very earliest
women members of the New York
Stock Exchange, where she was a pow-
erful voice for technology, science, and
innovation.
Ellen’s friendship was a gift, and her
legacy was one of outstanding leader-
ship marked by deep patriotism and
tireless commitment to progress.
May it be a comfort to Ellen’s be-
loved daughter, Katherine, and her
many, many loved ones that so many
share their loss and pray for them at
this sad time.
Mr. Speaker, I now ask that Members
and guests in the gallery rise to ob-
serve a moment of silence.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
SWALWELL of California). All present
will rise to observe a moment of si-
lence.

There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 329 and rule
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in
the Committee of the Whole House on

ation of the bill, H.R. 9.
The Chair appoints the gentleman
from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER) to pre-

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
consideration of the bill (H.R. 9) to di-
rect the President to develop a plan for
the United States to meet its nation-
ally determined contribution under the
Paris Agreement, and for other pur-
poses, with Mr. BLUMENAUER in the
chair.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the
House the bill is considered read the
first time.
General debate shall not exceed 90
minutes, with 60 minutes equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs, and 30 min-
utes equally divided and controlled by
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Energy and
Commerce.
The gentleman from New York (Mr.
ENGEL) and the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. MCCAUL) each will control 30 min-
utes, and the gentleman from New Jer-
sey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gentleman
from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each will
control 15 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New York.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself as much time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now
Act.
I shouldn’t need to persuade anyone
in this Chamber that we desperately
need to take serious action on climate
change. Just look at the news. We are
already seeing the consequences of our
inaction: natural disasters, famines, in-
stability, human suffering.
The time for action to avoid the
worst effects of climate change is rap-
idly closing. We must demonstrate to
the rest of the world and to future gen-
erations that we are still committed to
taking on this fight.
Climate change is a national security
threat that transcends borders and re-
quires international coordination. That
is why it is so critical that we work
shoulder to shoulder with our friends
and partners around the world.
The negotiation of the Paris Agree-
ment was a defining moment for the fu-
ture of our planet. For the first time,
the countries of the world came to-
gether to face this global crisis.
At challenging times like these, the
international community usually looks
to the United States for leadership. So
when President Trump announced his
intention to withdraw from this land-
mark agreement, it sent an unmistak-
able message that America is on the re-
treat. It is really just shameful.
Every nation in the world has now
signed on to the Paris Agreement. If we
withdraw, we will be the only country
unwilling to step up to this challenge.
We can—we must—do better.
The Climate Action Now Act keeps
the United States in the Paris climate
accord, renewing our country’s pledge
to address climate change head-on.
The Paris Agreement allows every
country to determine its own pollution
reduction targets and to develop a pub-
lic plan for how to meet those targets.
This bill follows that same model. It
gives the executive branch total flexi-
bility to decide what approach we need
to follow and what kind of technology
we need to use to reach our national
targets.
H.R. 9 gives us all an opportunity to
show Americans that we hear them,
that we take their concerns seriously,
and that we are addressing this danger
that is hurting their health and safety.
Mr. Chair, it is time for Congress to
put our country back on the right path
to address the climate change crisis
facing the world. I strongly support
passage of H.R. 9, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself as much time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chairman, we can all agree that
the climate is changing and we need to
take positive steps to address it. How-
ever, I oppose H.R. 9 because it is just
a messaging bill that is dead on arrival
in the Senate and that the President
will veto.
I oppose H.R. 9 because, among other
problems, it attempts to codify Presi-
dent Obama’s unrealistic and unilater-
ally determined greenhouse gas reduc-
tion pledge under the Paris Agreement.
This pledge was submitted on behalf of
the United States without any notifi-
cation, consultation, or role for Con-
gress.
At a recent hearing, when we asked
whether any of the witnesses agreed
that President Obama should have sub-
mitted the Paris Agreement to the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3364 May 1, 2019
Senate for ratification, all four wit-
nesses, including the three Democrat
witnesses, agreed it should have been
submitted to the Senate.
In addition to not involving Con-
gress, the Obama administration also
did not seek meaningful input from
private-sector stakeholders, such as en-
ergy companies.
Not only that, the administration
provided no cost-benefit analysis or
economic justification to rationalize
its pledge—its arbitrary pledge—to cut
greenhouse gases by 26 to 28 percent
below 2005 levels by 2025.
A recent study by the Chamber of
Commerce estimates it could cost U.S.
GDP $250 billion and 2.7 million jobs by
2025. By 2040, it could cost the United
States economy $3 trillion and 6.5 mil-
lion industrial sector jobs.
But the good news is that, even be-
fore the United States entered the
Paris Agreement, the United States
started making progress to signifi-
cantly reduce our greenhouse gas emis-
sions. According to the EPA, from 1990
to 2014, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions
per GDP declined by 40 percent, and we
are at the lowest emissions levels since
2000.
In addition, over the last decade, U.S.
greenhouse gas emissions have de-
creased by 14 percent, Mr. Chairman,
while China’s emissions doubled. Sadly,
China, the world’s largest greenhouse
gas emitter, under this agreement, will
continue to increase its emissions
through 2030 under its unenforceable
Paris Agreement pledge.
Other major greenhouse gas emitters,
like Russia, have signed the Paris
Agreement but have not ratified it.
Instead of doubling down on a pledge
that Congress had no role in setting
that will have a potentially cata-
strophic impact on the United States
economy and which will do nothing,
Mr. Chairman, to address China and
other countries’ growing emissions, we
should work on bipartisan legislation
to boost research, advance tech-
nologies, promote innovation, and de-
velop real solutions.
That is why I offered an amendment
calling for bipartisan solutions to ad-
dress this challenge, providing a mean-
ingful role for Congress regarding the
Paris Agreement, and requiring our
greenhouse gas reduction commit-
ments to undergo a rigorous cost-ben-
efit analysis. Sadly, this amendment
failed by a party-line vote in the com-
mittee and the Rules Committee, deny-
ing it from even being debated on this
House floor.
So for that, Mr. Chairman, and many
other reasons, I oppose H.R. 9, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself as much time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chairman, my friend on the
other side of the aisle just said that all
four witnesses at our April 2 hearing in
the Foreign Affairs Committee ex-
pressed agreement that President
Obama should have submitted the
Paris accord to the Senate for ratifica-
tion. I was there and chaired the hear-
ing. I didn’t hear that.
Let me tell you that, first of all, we
were proud to welcome a distinguished
panel of national security leaders, in-
cluding former military officials. They
offered detailed descriptions of the
risks that climate change poses to our
national security.
They talked about how climate
change acts as a threat multiplier and
a source of international conflict, how
it makes individuals more vulnerable
to recruitment by violent extremist or-
ganizations, how it is increasing great
power competition and tensions in
places like the Arctic, and how it is the
driver of extreme weather and natural
disasters that require dangerous and
expensive military responses.
More to my point, there was a fleet-
ing question about whether any wit-
ness disagreed with the statement that
President Obama should have sub-
mitted the Paris Agreement to the
Senate for ratification. The only re-
sponse, I believe, came from one re-
tired admiral, who simply said, ‘‘mili-
tary, not political,’’ meaning he is not
the right guy to ask, nor were any of
the other witnesses, so they all sat in
silence.
As my colleague should know, silence
is not an assent, whether it is at a con-
gressional hearing or at a deposition or
even in the exit row of an overcrowded
commercial airplane. A person must
give a verbal ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no’’ for their
answer to be accepted and relied upon.
So I just want to clear the record, be-
cause what really happened is one of
my colleagues posed a question to the
wrong person and got no answer.
So when it comes to arguing that the
Paris Agreement needed to be sub-
mitted to the Senate for ratification,
my colleagues are incorrect as a mat-
ter of international law and incorrect
as a matter of U.S. law. The previous
President had the authority to enter
into the Paris Agreement, derived from
the Constitution, the Senate-approved
United Nations Framework on Climate
Change, and domestic law.
We all know that the vast majority
of international agreements entered
into by the U.S. are not approved by
the Senate, and the Paris Agreement is
no different.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.
CASTOR), the author of this bill.
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair, I
thank Chairman ENGEL of the Foreign
Affairs Committee for yielding the
time.
Mr. Chairman, I rise humbly as a
Representative of my home State of
Florida and as a patriotic American
but, especially today, as a mother of
two daughters and future generations
because I feel the weight of our moral
responsibility to address climate
change.
This is a historic day here in the
House of Representatives. This is the
first time in 10 years that major cli-
mate legislation is being heard in the
people’s House.
b 1445
H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act,
is where we will start by honoring
America’s commitment to address the
climate crisis, and it is a crisis. The
last time global monthly temperatures
were below average was in February of
1985. That means everyone who is 34
years of age or younger has grown up
in a world that has been forever altered
by the change in climate.
How severe the impacts of climate
change will be to us personally over
time depends on the actions that we
take now.
Based on the latest science from the
administration’s own National Climate
Assessment, we have reason to worry.
Seas are rising. America’s heartland
and farms have suffered unprecedented
floods. Snowpack is shrinking, and
that is bad for clean water supplies.
Droughts are getting worse. Hot,
humid heat waves are becoming more
intense, with more days where people
cannot safely work or play outside.
Higher temperatures mean that pollut-
ants, like ground-level ozone from car
exhaust, will become more damaging
to our health.
One-and-a-half years ago, I had to
pack up my home, board up the win-
dows and doors, pack up my most cher-
ished belongings, and flee as Hurricane
Irma, that monster hurricane, threat-
ened the State of Florida. We were
scared of a huge storm surge coming up
from the Gulf of Mexico and into
Tampa Bay. We were petrified.
Fortunately, we had time to get out
of the way, but that isn’t true for so
many Americans who have suffered
floods, fires, and more. They haven’t
been as lucky. And the risks and costs
going forward are likely to be more se-
vere.
What is necessary to combat the cli-
mate crisis is to stop carbon pollution
from accumulating in the atmosphere.
That requires action, urgent action,
ambitious action.
Fortunately, we have made some
progress in recent years in cutting car-
bon pollution. Thousands of businesses,
houses of worship, States, and commu-
nities are taking action. Now they are
demanding that we do the same.
A few years ago, there was also good
news. After years of finger-pointing,
the United States, China, India, Eu-
rope, and other countries, all of the
countries around the world, came to-
gether and agreed to cut carbon pollu-
tion. With America’s leadership and en-
gagement, the U.S. led other nations in
committing to take climate action in
an international agreement called the
Paris climate accord. The agreement
was a breakthrough.
After years of playing the blame
game, nearly every other country said,
here is our plan, and each country de-
veloped its own individual plan, and
America has done just that. That plan
has incredible upsides.

We are creating millions of clean en-
ergy jobs right now, and they are good-
paying jobs. We are saving billions of
dollars on home energy bills, and busi-
nesses are saving huge amounts of
money through energy efficiency. We
can finally address climate injustice.
And despite what the Trump admin-
istration says, America is still in the
international agreement. We have not
formally withdrawn. If this bill be-
comes law, we never will, because
America does not cut and run, America
keeps its commitments, and we will re-
commit to doing so when we pass this
bill.
My Climate Action Now bill is
straightforward. It would block the ad-
ministration from spending any money
on withdrawal, and it would require
the Trump administration to release
its plan to cut carbon pollution.
Americans overwhelmingly support
U.S. leadership on the climate crisis
because they understand that when
America leads, we win. Ask the 23
States, 300 cities, and more than 2,000
businesses who have pledged to honor
the Paris goals. Now they will be
joined by the House of Representatives.
Some of the fastest growing jobs in
America are clean energy, engineering,
green building, solar installers, and
wind turbine technicians. This is just
the beginning, but we have to stay on
course.
The CHAIR. The time of the gentle-
woman has expired.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I yield an
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman.
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. In addition
to sending an important signal to clean
energy, job-creating businesses, this
will send an important signal to our al-
lies across the world. We expect ambi-
tious action from them.
I have heard my friends on the other
side of the aisle say, but China. Well, if
the President forces a retreat here,
other countries will retreat, as well. A
vote against H.R. 9 is a vote to let
China off the hook. This is a patriotic
vote. Vote for America, vote for our fu-
ture, and keep us in the climate Paris
Agreement. I thank the hundreds of my
colleagues who have joined this, and I
thank the brave Republicans who will
join us in this patriotic vote for Cli-
mate Action Now.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chairman, I am
pleased to yield 31⁄2 minutes to the dis-
tinguished gentleman from Florida
(Mr. YOHO), a member of the Foreign
Affairs Committee.
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the chairman for yielding.
Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong
opposition to H.R. 9, the Climate Ac-
tion Now Act, not because we don’t
want clean water or clean air or deny a
world-changing climate. H.R. 9 is a di-
rect attack on this administration for
withdrawing from the flawed agree-
ment and is a purely political move by
my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle.
The Paris Agreement requires each
signatory country to determine, plan,
and regularly report on the contribu-
tions that it undertakes to mitigate
global warming with no regard for
American consumers; it places burden-
some regulations on American busi-
nesses that are already employing en-
vironmentally friendly practices; and
it places the cost of the Paris Agree-
ment to supplement other nations on
the backs of the moms, dads, and citi-
zens of America.
In August 2016, President Obama uni-
laterally accepted the Paris Agreement
under the United Nations climate
change treaty. Rather than bringing it
to this body, where it could be ratified
with the advice and consent of the Sen-
ate, this was a blatant power grab by
the executive branch encumbering
America and future generations.
I had been opposed to President
Obama’s decision to circumvent con-
gressional approval of the Paris Agree-
ment from the beginning. It was a clear
violation of the Constitution to leave
Congress out of the approval process of
an agreement that will have far-reach-
ing implications on our economy and
our citizens.
During the 114th Congress, I even in-
troduced H.R. 544, expressing the sense
of the House that the President should
submit any binding international
agreement on climate change to the
Senate as a treaty. By accepting the
Paris Agreement without congressional
approval, the Obama administration
made promises that are too expensive
and too difficult and not science-based
as far as the results. In fact, in a cur-
rent hearing, it was stated that if the
U.S. were to cut emissions to zero, it
would not change global warming.
A report prepared by NERA Eco-
nomic Consulting in 2017, found that
meeting the commitments President
Obama made could cost the U.S. econ-
omy $3 trillion and 6.5 million indus-
trial-sector jobs by 2040. There are seri-
ous concerns surrounding costs, effec-
tiveness, and feasibility of U.S. com-
mitments made under the Paris Agree-
ment.
Greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.
fell by 14 percent from 2005 to 2017, our
manufacturing output increased 4 per-
cent, and our energy consumption went
down 2 percent. That is American lead-
ership done by the private sector, not
by government mandates or encum-
bering agreements.
The United States is already leading
around the world in reducing green-
house gas emissions. This agreement
does not address the world’s largest
carbon emission offenders, as you have
heard—China and India. These coun-
tries are not held to any enforcement
standards besides being required to
provide a report to the United Nations
every 5 years.
Again, the Paris Agreement ties the
hands of the American consumers to
pay for countries, like China and India,
whose total commitment is, ‘‘We will
try to reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions’’—not do it, but we will try—
while they continue to increase our
carbon footprints around the world,
again at the cost of nearly $3 trillion to
the American consumer.
The CHAIR. The time of the gen-
tleman has expired.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chairman, I yield
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Florida.
Mr. YOHO. China is building or plan-
ning to build over 700 coal-fired power
plants around the world with one-fifth
of these plants located in countries
outside of China, making it virtually
impossible for them to meet goals set
in the Paris Agreement.
Additionally, of the 195 signatories,
13 countries have still not ratified the
agreement, including Russia, Turkey,
Yemen, Iraq, and Iran. Russia accounts
for nearly 5 percent of the global green-
house gas.
While I do believe that climate
change should be addressed, I do not
agree that forcing the President to re-
main in an agreement that had no
oversight, cost-benefit analysis or
stakeholder input is the right way to
go.
As we continue to have discussions
about how to address climate change,
we should focus on solutions for the
world body.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. LEVIN), a valued member of
the Foreign Affairs Committee.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair-
man, I thank Chairman ENGEL for
yielding, and I congratulate Represent-
ative CASTOR for her great leadership
on this issue.
Mr. Chairman, I feel it is odd listen-
ing to the very same argument that we
can’t go forward with this because
there is nothing to hold China or India
to account because there are no re-
quirements, and, at the same time, the
very same document puts a huge bur-
den on America by putting enforced re-
quirements on us. It doesn’t make any
sense.
Mr. Chairman, for decades, the sci-
entific community has understood the
need to fundamentally transition ev-
erything about how we live, work, and
move about this planet to protect life
on Earth as we know it. We have
known this for decades. And yet, know-
ing how destructive climate change is
to our health, our safety, and our na-
tional security, President Trump de-
cided to withdraw from the Paris
Agreement and neglect, not just the
fundamental responsibility to protect
Americans, but an enormous economic
opportunity.
I feel like I am listening to argu-
ments from lobbyists from the horse
and carriage industry against rail-
roads, or for the buggy whip industry
against paving roads because cars are
such a threat.
President Trump made a huge mis-
take by backing away from the com-
mitment we made in Paris. We are here
today to correct that mistake and to
steer our country back in the right di-
rection.

the-top emissions reduction commit-
ments.
There are two principles, I believe,
that should guide our international
agreements.
First, they should be fair and bene-
ficial to the American people.
Second, they should not put the
United States at a disadvantage vis-a-
vis other nations of the world.
The Paris Agreement fails on both
counts.
As already noted, if we implement
the commitments made by the Obama
administration as part of this agree-
ment, it could cost the U.S. gross do-
mestic product $250 billion and elimi-
nate 2.7 million jobs. That is hardly
fair and beneficial to the American
people.
As it is, the Paris Agreement allows
countries to determine their own com-
mitments, without regard to their
emissions. Should this remain the case,
the United States will forever be at a
disadvantage to self-interested coun-
tries, like China and Russia, whose
emissions continue to grow. Mean-
while, our emissions were the lowest in
2017 since 1992. Despite this, our com-
mitments far outweigh those made by
the worst greenhouse gas offenders.
I submitted an amendment that
would have, at the very least, ad-
dressed the disadvantage of this agree-
ment. My amendment would have
changed the enacted date of H.R. 9 to
whenever the Secretary of State could
certify that Russia and China were
making commitments equivalent to
ours.
I regret that it was not made in order
and that my colleagues across the aisle
denied us the opportunity to do right
by the American people. H.R. 9 is an
outrage, Mr. Chairman, and I urge my
colleagues to vote against it.

Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, I yield myself
such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, I want to remind my col-
leagues that the United States was
once a global leader in pushing for cli-
mate action, but the current adminis-
tration has largely abandoned our ef-
forts to mitigate the effects of a warm-
ing world. As a result, our progress in
reducing pollution has dwindled and is
now reversing itself.
The Environmental Protection Agen-
cy’s latest data shows that reductions
in greenhouse gas pollution fell to just
half a percent in 2017, and, according to
the International Energy Agency, U.S.
carbon dioxide pollution actually rose
by 3.1 percent in 2018.
Think about that for a minute. At a
time when the world desperately needs
to decrease emissions, ours increased.
In a year, where more dirty coal plants
closed than almost any other year in
history, our emissions increased. So
this bill is absolutely important.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms.
SPANBERGER), a valued member of the
Foreign Affairs Committee.
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of
H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act.
Back in 2003, 16 years ago, the Pen-
tagon commissioned a report on how
climate change would impact our abil-
ity to keep our country safe. Its con-
clusion? That we should move beyond
scientific debate and treat ongoing eco-
logical damage as a serious national
security threat.
Our military and intelligence com-
munities agree that climate change ex-
acerbates conflict and instability. It
weakens fragile governments, contrib-
utes to food and water insecurity, and
perpetuates poverty.
These are threat multipliers, and
they present real risk to U.S. interests
around the globe, especially in areas
vulnerable to extreme weather, such as
the Middle East and sub-Saharan Afri-
ca.
As a former CIA officer, I recognize
that combating climate change is a na-
tional security imperative, and the
first step in this fight is to keep our
word to cooperate with our allies and
partners in this battle. By staying in
the Paris Agreement, we demonstrate
that the United States takes our plan-
et’s fate seriously, keeps its word, and
can be a steady partner in future agree-
ments. Going forward, we must use our
country’s tremendous diplomatic, mili-
tary, and economic strength as assets
in this global fight.
Today, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation because our coun-
try cannot afford to abdicate its role of
leadership.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON).
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chair, I thank my
friend from Texas.
Mr. Chairman, we are here today be-
cause the previous administration
wanted to score political points before
leaving office by saving the world for
America’s leadership on greenhouse gas
emissions.
The former administration’s chasing
glory on foreign soils signed the Paris
climate agreement, or, as folks back
home call it, ‘‘the kill America’s econ-
omy agreement so China can take my
jobs.’’
The Constitution, Article II, Section
2, paragraph 2, sentence 1, says very
clearly: ‘‘He shall have the power, by
and with the advice and consent of the
Senate, to make treaties, provided two-
thirds of the Senators present concur.’’
The Paris Agreement looks, smells,
and feels like a treaty.
The worst offender for climate
change in the world, China, had their
legislature approve the Paris Agree-
ment. President Obama never sent that
to the Senate for approval, and since
the Paris Agreement was never ap-
proved, it has the same power as this
blank piece of paper.
Here are some numbers, some facts:
From 2000 to 2014, America’s global
leadership has reduced our emissions
by 18 percent.
From a study by the EIA, despite
having an increase of 3.1 percent of CO2
in 2017, we are down 14 percent from
1990 levels for CO2.
Former Secretary of State John
Kerry noted through negotiations from
Paris that if America and all of the de-
veloped countries of the world cut their
gas CO2 emissions to zero, emissions
for the world would take over, and we
would still be in the same position.
The CHAIR. The time of the gen-
tleman has expired.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chairman, I yield
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Texas.
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chair, in conclusion,
America does not need the Paris Agree-
ment.
Russia needs the Paris Agreement;
China needs the Paris agreement; India
needs the Paris Agreement; the Euro-
pean Union needs the Paris Agreement.
We don’t have to take this. We have
proven to the world with technology
and the free market, we can make this
Earth cleaner.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to vote for the families, vote for the
local jobs—vote against H.R. 9.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, let me
say, the whole world—not just the
United States and not just China—
needs to do more if we are to be spared
from the worst damage of climate
change.
Under Paris, China committed to lev-
eling off its carbon emissions no later
than 2030 and reducing its carbon in-
tensity by 60 to 65 percent from 2005
levels by 2030. And that is a big step to-
wards sustainability.
Meanwhile, global action on climate
change has already spared public and

private-sector investments and green
innovation. China has created the
world’s largest carbon market, pumped
approximately three times as much
money into renewables as we have, and
surpassed the United States in terms of
both the number of electric vehicles on
the road and the number of publicly
available charging stations.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.
LEE), the distinguished chairwoman.
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chair, I
thank the chairman for yielding, for
his tremendous leadership on this and
so many issues.
Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support
of H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act.
This piece of legislation is an ex-
tremely important first step in pro-
tecting our environment—major first
step—and we have to move forward and
do even more.
H.R. 9 ensures that the United States
remains in the Paris Agreement and
prohibits Federal funding to exit the
agreement. It is critical that the
United States takes the lead on ad-
dressing climate change on the world’s
stage.
Let me be clear. The Trump Adminis-
tration is plugging their ears and pre-
tending that climate change doesn’t
exist.
America was once a global leader in
fighting climate change. It was our
leadership that led so many nations to
commit to climate action. Yet this ad-
ministration has abandoned plans to
address climate change and, instead,
has weakened our leadership in the
world. It is really shameful, and this
needs to stop.
Climate change is an urgent matter.
It creates more flooding and super-
storms, threatening the safety of mil-
lions of Americans and people around
the world.
People around our country and
throughout the world are breathing in
polluted and unhealthy air. Here in our
own country, communities of color and
low-income communities also, dis-
proportionately, are impacted by the
effects of climate change and have a
lack of access to adequate healthcare
services on top of that.
We owe it to our children and future
generations to do more for the environ-
ment. I urge my colleagues to vote
‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 9 and ‘‘yes’’ on fighting
climate change.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. KEVIN
HERN), a member of the Natural Re-
sources Committee.
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Mr.
Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R.
9, the Climate Action Now Act.
America has long been the standard
of leadership, freedom, and innovation.
We do not allow other countries to
take advantage of us.
While H.R. 9 has many issues, my op-
position is founded in its attempt to
strip our President of his constitu-
tional executive authority and force us
to remain locked in an agreement that
hurts American taxpayers.
After the Obama administration’s
international apology tour, it is a re-
freshing change to have a strong hand
at the wheel. I am glad to see President
Trump defending our exceptionalism
instead of sacrificing our economy for
the sake of other countries.
My colleagues across the aisle would
have us believe that we are headed for
doom within a decade, that Americans
are behind the curve. In reality, we
lead the world in reducing greenhouse
gas emissions, while other countries
are growing emissions; yet America is
paying the lion’s share in the Paris Cli-
mate Accord.
American innovation and techno-
logical advancements are second to
none. These are the same qualities of
American excellence that made us the
greatest country on this planet. We
should not lower our standards and
allow other nations to take advantage
of us.
This poorly negotiated deal will do
nothing to address the growing emis-
sions from China and other industrial
countries. It only hurts American jobs,
especially the energy industry that em-
ploys hundreds of thousands of people
in Oklahoma and brings high-paying
jobs to my district. These are people
who are hurt by the continuation of
the Paris Climate accord.
I applaud President Trump’s leader-
ship on this issue and support his au-
thority to remove us from the Paris
climate accord.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, there is a
lot of misinformation out there about
the Paris Agreement, including the
idea that it will hurt the U.S. econ-
omy. The Paris Agreement will cost
little or nothing, and allowing climate
change to proceed would certainly be
very expensive indeed.
A raft of studies from environmental
organizations, Citibank, and the Orga-
nization for Economic Cooperation and
Development all argue that a failure to
mitigate the effects of climate change
could cost the U.S. economy trillions
of dollars. Citi found that investing in
low-carbon energy to address climate
change would save the world $1.8 tril-
lion through 2040, but not acting will
cost an additional $44 trillion by 2060.
Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to
how much time each side has remain-
ing.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
New York has 121⁄2 minutes remaining.
The gentleman from Texas has 151⁄2
minutes remaining.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 min-
utes to the gentleman from New Jersey
(Mr. PASCRELL).
Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today because I know climate change is
real, and its impacts are already here.
In New Jersey, we know those impacts
all too well.
Superstorm Sandy sent an unprece-
dented storm surge up the Hudson and
the Hackensack Rivers that destroyed
homes, businesses, police departments,
and critical infrastructure that our
neighbors are still digging out of this
day.
These once-in-a-generation storms
have a human toll. In 2017, the destruc-
tion and failed response to Hurricane
Maria by the Trump Administration
led to over 3,000 Americans dying—
3,000.
The time for waiting is over. We need
to act right now. Climate scientists are
in universal agreement. Our planet is
warming, and it will continue to inflict
catastrophic devastation.
Military and intelligence experts
have warned it is a national security
threat. You are no longer going to edu-
cate Americans to hide their head in
the sand.
We need to work together, one na-
tion, as an international community.
The goals some have set above have
been called overly ambitious. You bet
they are ambitious. These are big prob-
lems, and Americans tackle big prob-
lems with big solutions.
Supporting H.R. 9 would do just that.
It shows the world the United States is
committed to the Paris Agreement,
that we are serious about setting tar-
gets for carbon emissions reductions.
This agreement is the bare minimum
we can do to prevent against the im-
pacts of climate change.
We need to be serious about getting
this right, that we are serious about
preserving the world for our people, for
our children, like my grandchildren
and their grandchildren, Mr. Chairman,
because that is who this is about.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chairman, let me
first say to my good friend from New
Jersey that there are many of us on
this side of the aisle who agree the cli-
mate is changing, and I think it is a
question of how we get there and the
solutions and innovation and tech-
nology.
I hope that—it will not move for-
ward; it will be, obviously, vetoed—
maybe we can work together in a bi-
partisan way on something that can re-
duce emissions using innovation tech-
nology. I personally think nuclear
power should be examined as well.
With that, I yield 2 minutes to the
distinguished gentleman from New
York (Mr. ZELDIN), a member of the
Foreign Affairs Committee.

Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Chair, I thank Mr.
MCCAUL for his statements, and I agree
with everything that was just stated. I
have great respect for Chairman ENGEL
and the bill’s sponsor, Ms. CASTOR, and
for their intentions and their advocacy.
I look forward to working with them
on this issue and many others because
this is a very important issue for us to
be working on, on both sides of the
aisle in both the House and the Senate.
We all have constituents who want
access to clean air and clean water. It

gan, or you are in Tampa, Florida, or

want to advocate for that for our con-
stituents.
I was concerned with the negotiation
of the Paris climate deal, that there
wasn’t more discussion. There wasn’t
any discussion in Congress. There
weren’t hearings and votes. There
wasn’t enough of an analysis done of
the impact on the economy.
There is a debate now over numbers.
I wish it was fleshed out. What will be
the impact on GDP? What will be the
impact on jobs? What will be the im-
pact on energy costs for my constitu-
ents? There are a lot of numbers that
are going around that are very con-
cerning to my constituents.
Other countries were having debates,
and they were having votes publicly. In
this case, this was not submitted to the
United States Senate for ratification,
and there was some discussion earlier
about what happened at the House For-
eign Affairs Committee meeting on
this topic.
What I asked of the witnesses was:
‘‘Do any of the witnesses disagree with
the statement that President Obama
should have submitted it to the Senate
for ratification?’’ That was the exact
wording of my question.
If you look at the video of the re-
sponse, no one disagreed. I asked:
‘‘Does anyone disagree?’’ No one dis-
agreed. There was one person, Admiral
McGinn, who specified that his role
was military, not political.
The CHAIR. The time of the gen-
tleman has expired.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chair, I yield an
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman
from New York.
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Chair, I thank the
ranking member for yielding.
He said his role was military, not po-
litical, but nobody disagreed with that
statement.
I believe it should have been sub-
mitted.
I also think it is outrageous that
China and India are not doing more.
They are emitters. China, in fact,
won’t even comply to reduce its carbon
emissions until 2030. Many other coun-
tries that made commitments aren’t
fulfilling their commitments.
We needed a better deal for the world
and other countries to step up and do
more, more transparency and debates,
and a vote here in Congress. That is in
the best interests of all our constitu-
ents.
Hopefully, we can agree on the num-
bers and a process going forward, and
we can work together on a bipartisan
basis.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentlewoman from Or-
egon (Ms. BONAMICI).
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chair, climate
change is one of the greatest existen-
tial threats of our time. I am honored
to serve on the House Select Com-
mittee on the Climate Crisis with the
leadership of the author of this bill,
Representative CASTOR.
In Oregon, smoke from raging
wildfires makes the air unhealthy to
breathe. Acidic oceans are threatening
our fishing industries. Droughts and
extreme weather patterns jeopardize
the livelihoods of our farmers. Warmer
water in the Columbia River is further
threatening endangered salmon.
My home State of Oregon is one of
the many States committed to meeting
the Paris climate agreement targets,
but climate change is a global crisis,
which is why more than 175 countries
have signed on to the agreement.
The Climate Action Now Act is a
clear signal to our international allies
and to the world that the United
States, at least the United States
House of Representatives, supports up-
holding our Nation’s commitments to
the planet. This is about U.S. leader-
ship.
The cost of inaction on climate
change is too high to wait any longer.
We can protect the planet, unleash in-
novation, and create good jobs. This
bill is an important first step.
Mr. Chair, I thank Chair ENGEL,
Chair MCGOVERN, and Chair CASTOR for
their leadership. I urge all my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to
support this important bill.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chair, I am pleased
to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
MEUSER).
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Chair, I thank
Ranking Member MCCAUL for yielding.
Mr. Chair, in my district in Pennsyl-
vania, we are conservationists. But
with this bill, H.R. 9, the Climate Ac-
tion Now Act, more appropriately
known as the U.S. energy disadvantage
act, the American people are being told
yet again that Big Government is the
solution to all of the people’s problems.
The American people know better than
that, and they expect solutions, not
more government.
The latest data is revealing. The U.S.
is actually a global leader in the reduc-
tion of greenhouse gas emissions.
In 2017, while global CO2 emissions
increased by 1.6 percent, the United
States reduced its CO2 emissions by
more than 42 million tons, an annual
reduction of 0.5 percent, the largest re-
duction of any country in the world.
The data also underscores that we
have not seen this type of progress
from other countries that are still part
of the Paris Agreement. American
leadership is ongoing while countries
like Spain, Canada, India, South Korea,
and China and the EU are all increas-
ing their CO2 emissions by 100 million
tons and more.
If the U.S. stayed party to this agree-
ment, it would be a huge and unneces-
sary drag on our economy that would
be passed on to the American taxpayer.
Moreover, it would not improve the sit-
uation, as most of the world is moving
in the wrong direction.
The U.S. is reducing our emissions
without the heavy hand of this Con-
gress. This will continue, and it will be
factual, as it will be measured.
We need to harness American talent
and energies, not squander them with
bogus plans like the Green New Deal or
ineffective climate agreements.
We need access to affordable, reli-
able, and clean energy sources, includ-
ing natural gas, nuclear, oil, and clean
coal. We need to empower our private
sector to continue to innovate and de-
velop new technologies. What we need
is a true all-of-the-above and all-of-the-
below energy plan.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
consider this and vote against this bill.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, it is now my
pleasure to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. CRIST).
Mr. CRIST. Mr. Chair, I thank Chair-
man ENGEL for yielding me the time.
I rise in strong support of the Cli-
mate Action Now Act written by my
dear friend and the chairwoman of the
Select Committee on the Climate Cri-
sis, KATHY CASTOR. We are both blessed
to represent the Tampa Bay region of
Florida, which is the most economi-
cally vulnerable to climate change in
the world.
For the people back home, this isn’t
a partisan issue. It is real. It is hap-
pening. It threatens our environment,
our quality of life, and our economy.
I know there are friends and col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle
struggling with this issue, and I want
to offer encouragement: Do not wait
for the next 1,000-year flood to hit your
district or the next freak Category 5
hurricane that explodes over warming
seas right before landfall. Do not wait
for the next drought-fueled firestorm
to destroy one of your towns or for ris-
ing sea levels to flood the streets when
it rains during high tide, as it does in
parts of my district.
The time to act is yesterday. Please
vote ‘‘yes.’’

gan (Mr. WALBERG).
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chair, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Chair, as a member of the Energy
and Commerce Committee, I rise today
in opposition to H.R. 9, more appro-
priately named the U.S. energy dis-
advantage act.
The bill attempts to lock us into a
bad deal. While the United States is
continuing to lower its emissions and
to lead the world through techno-
logical innovation, other countries
around the world are not meeting even
their targets. Some aren’t making tar-
gets. Those countries came up with
targets on their own, and they still
aren’t living up to them.
Staying in the Paris Agreement
would raise energy prices and slow eco-
nomic growth without curbing emis-
sions in a meaningful, global fashion.
Mr. Chair, we are not the ones who
are polluting the air and the water. We
are cleaning it up. We are doing it as a
result of doing the right thing. Yet,
Mr. Chair, today, the ones that are pol-
luting greatest are doing nothing other
than just being told to think up some-
thing by 2030.

to get to work on legislating, not polit-
ical messaging.
The American people sent us here to
work on solutions to healthcare, infra-
structure, education, the economy, and
much more. Let’s get to work on that,
and let’s encourage the nations of the
world to do the right thing and get in-
volved in doing what the United States
has done already and, by the way, will
continue to do.
Mr. Chair, I oppose this bill. We all
should.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, I yield myself
such time as I may consume.
When President Trump announced
plans to withdraw the U.S. from the
Paris climate agreement in 2017, hun-
dreds of businesses from all over the
country immediately responded that it
was a mistake and that they would re-
double their own efforts to cut emis-
sions.
In a separate declaration a few days
later, a group called We Are Still In
said that, despite Trump, they con-
tinue to support climate action. They
argued that compliance with the Paris
Agreement would open markets and
generate jobs.
Today, We Are Still In is comprised
of over 3,500 leaders, including Gov-
ernors, mayors, universities, and over
1,800 companies working together to
uphold America’s promise to meet the
goals of the Paris Agreement.
Included in the coalition are some of
the country’s most successful compa-
nies, and I think you will recognize the
names: Adobe, Amazon, Apple, Belkin,
Ben & Jerry’s, Campbell’s, Chobani,
Citi, DuPont, eBay, Gap, Google, The
Hartford, Hewlett-Packard, Intel,
Johnson & Johnson, Levi Strauss, Lyft,
Mars, McDonald’s, MGM Resorts Inter-
national, Microsoft, and I can go on
and on.
The Paris Agreement will not on its
own solve our global warming prob-
lems, but it does present business and
investors with a historic opportunity
by signaling a new global consensus
that the transition to a clean energy
economy is underway.
The argument that the Paris Agree-
ment is somehow antibusiness or will
hurt our economy just doesn’t hold
water. So I encourage my friends on
the other side of the aisle to listen to
American businesses and treat climate
change as both the threat and oppor-
tunity that it is.
Mr. Chair, it is my pleasure to yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), our majority leader.
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chair, the over-
whelming majority of scientists in the
world, not just in the United States,
believe that climate change is one of
the major crises confronting the global
community.
We went to Paris, and the world com-
munity got together and adopted an
agreement that was voluntary in its
implementation. No sovereignty was
given up by any nation. They said that
scientists say we have a crisis and that
we need to respond to it.
My friend from Michigan who spoke
earlier, Mr. WALBERG, said that we
ought to be focused on education, hous-
ing, healthcare, and job creation. He is
right, but to ignore this problem is
dangerous and unacceptable.
Climate change is perhaps one of the
greatest threats we face as a nation
and as a planet. Those who deny it do
so at great peril to the health, secu-
rity, and economic prosperity of our
country.
H.R. 9 will not solve climate change.
The first step in any journey does not
get you there. But without it, you get
nowhere.
House Democrats are laying down a
marker today that we are committed
to tackling this challenge with the se-
riousness it deserves.
Recognizing and combating climate
change must be a global effort. This
legislation prohibits the Trump admin-
istration from using any funds to with-
draw from the Paris climate agree-
ment.
I tell my friends in the House that I
believe the overwhelming majority of
Americans support that proposition, as
do the citizens of the world.
b 1530
We have been the leader of the free
world. Withdrawing from an agreement
that was voluntarily entered into by
over 170 nations shrugs off the mantle
of leadership, moral and intellectual. If
the United States withdraws, then we
will be the only nation in the world not
to be part of this historic agreement
which embraces the goals previously
set by our country—joined by the con-
tribution of other nations—to reduce
carbon pollution, promote techno-
logical innovation, and help avoid the
most catastrophic consequences of cli-
mate change.
If we ignore the challenges of climate
change, then we will also close our-
selves off to opportunities to take the
lead in the race to develop and deploy
cleaner and more efficient tech-
nologies, which would create jobs and
grow businesses and be a boon to our
economy.
So I would suggest to my colleagues
that those who argue against this bill
argue not for economic progress, not
for the creation of jobs, but exactly the
opposite, and they deny the future: the
future of the economy, the future of
our health, the future of our environ-
ment, and the future of our children.
America, if it is to be great, must not
sit on the sidelines and shrug like
Atlas in confronting the rest of the
world. We must act on climate change.
Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my
dear friend, the chair of the Foreign
Affairs Committee, Mr. ENGEL, for his
leadership and his strong voice on be-
half of what is an international issue.
It is an issue for us, but it is an inter-
national issue.
I want to thank, as well, my dear
friend, Representative KATHY CASTOR,
for her leadership as chair of the House
Select Committee on the Climate Cri-
sis and for introducing H.R. 9.
I also want to thank Chairman
PALLONE and the Energy and Com-
merce Committee for their leadership.
There have been over 30 hearings on
this issue. All concluded we must have
a concerted effort to address climate
change, and House Democrats will con-
tinue to do our part. But this ought to
be a bipartisan vote. Every citizen—Re-
publican, Democrat, Independent, and
nonaffiliated—are going to be affected
if we do not deal with climate change,
and their children as well.
I look forward to bringing to the
floor future legislation from our com-
mittees which seeks to tackle the cli-
mate crisis with substantive proposals,
but I urge my colleagues: Let’s take
this first step. Let’s say that we are
not going to withdraw from the rest of
the world. Let’s say we are going to
continue to lead on an issue that there
is a global consensus on that we must
deal with climate change. Take this
step. Assert America’s leadership.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. GRAVES).
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr.
Chairman, I want to thank the distin-
guished leader for his statement.
I, too, wish this were a bipartisan
bill. I do. I wish it were a bipartisan
bill. Unfortunately, as the ranking
member of the House Select Com-
mittee on the Climate Crisis, I found
out about this from the press, not from
the chairman of the committee. I found
out from the press about this bill. That
is not how you pursue bipartisan legis-
lation. If there were a true attempt and
a true desire to do bipartisan legisla-
tion, certainly this would have been
handled differently.
Let me be clear, Mr. Chairman, I
fully agree that the climate is chang-
ing. I agree that humans are contrib-
uting to that change. I agree that there
is something that we need to do about
this, and we need to be aggressive.
As we heard from scientists just yes-
terday in the House Select Committee
on the Climate Crisis, they have con-
firmed to us that the United States can
eliminate all emissions, and we are
still going to see warming. We are not
going to see changes in the tempera-
ture if we eliminate all of our emis-
sions.
Mr. Chairman, China, right now, is
the top emitter. They are emitting 80
percent more than the United States.
As a matter of fact, Greenpeace found
last year they are actually increasing
their emissions. Here we are, the
United States, for about the last 20
years, the largest absolute reduction in
emissions of any country in the world.
The Paris accord is fundamentally
flawed. It is not the solution. We can
eliminate all of our emissions, Mr.
Chairman, and you are going to have
countries like China that are allowed,
under the Paris accords, to come in and
more than replace all of our emissions

reductions. That doesn’t make sense,
and it is not fair. This coming from a
country that has already stolen tril-
lions of dollars in intellectual property
and cost this country millions of jobs.
Let me say it again: Climate change
is real, and we need to take action.
This agreement is fundamentally
flawed. It benefits China.
Of course other countries agree. It is
on the back of the United States, the
nation that spends more money on cli-
mate change science and more money
on climate change technology than any
other country in the world.
Mr. Chairman, this bill is fundamen-
tally flawed. This whole agreement is
fundamentally flawed. China has an en-
tirely different metric to measure their
emissions reduction than the United
States, and they don’t even have to re-
duce a single degree of emissions until
after 2030.
Mr. Chairman, this is a flawed bill,
and I urge rejection.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. MATSUI).
Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today as a proud original cosponsor of
H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act,
which preserves our Nation’s commit-
ment to the Paris Agreement and
keeps our promise to the American
people to take meaningful action on
climate change.
The Paris Agreement paved the way
for our Nation to develop a robust plan
for cutting emissions which both
threaten public health and contribute
to global climate change. Part of this
plan was to clean up the transportation
sector, now the largest single source of
emissions in the country.
My home State of California was
critical in the effort to establish more
stringent vehicle emissions standards.
When the administration irresponsibly
chose to abandon part of this plan by
rolling back Obama-era vehicle emis-
sions standards, I introduced legisla-
tion that would protect these stand-
ards and the benefits that they ulti-
mately bring to our communities.
I am pleased to see so many of my
congressional colleagues join me in
proposing meaningful solutions to com-
bat climate change, but we must do
more. We must act together as a nation
to lead the way.
Our Nation cannot afford to cede its
international leadership. By not par-
ticipating in the Paris Agreement, we
risk irreversible damage to our planet
and endanger the American people.
I think about my grandchildren,
Anna and Robby. It is their future I am
thinking about. They will be greatly
impacted if we don’t do something now.
Tackling climate change is and al-
ways has been my top priority. We
must act now to mitigate the effects of
climate change before it is too late. I
have spent the last decade helping lead
on this effort, and I am immensely
pleased to be able to support the Cli-
mate Action Now Act on the floor
today.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKIN-
LEY), who is a member of the Energy
and Commerce Committee.
Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, let’s
be clear. We must have a global ap-
proach to the climate crisis, but giving
a pass to countries like China and
India subverts that process. Look at
their record. Since 2001, there has been
a 290 percent increase in emissions;
India, 235. We have got a negative 16.
We are reducing that.
So because of their miserable record
of curtailing greenhouse gases, we still,
in America, across the country, in
rural areas, are going to face droughts,
wildfires, and sea level rise. Because of
India and China, experts are saying
that Miami, Florida, and Baltimore are
still going to flood.
So let’s be honest. The Paris accord
is really nothing more about political
theater than actually addressing cli-
mate change.
Instead, we should have an agree-
ment that is enforceable with legally
binding targets and specific financial
support that provides for liability or
compensation for damages that could
be caused and an understanding that
global communities are still fossil fuel
driven.
America should not unilaterally
transform our energy policies while
gambling that other nations will vol-
untarily—and I underscore that, volun-
tarily—reduce their emissions. History
and past agreements indicate other na-
tions are not following the lead of the
United States.
Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ on H.R.
9.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chairman, I have
no further speakers, and I yield myself
the balance of my time.
Mr. Chairman, I just want to start off
by saying that I respect the chairman.
I respect his point of view, and I re-
spect the arguments that have been
made on this floor. I believe they are
genuine. I believe that most Members
of this Chamber agree that climate
change is real and that climate change
presents a risk.
I sat down with a scientist from
NASA, which is in my home State. We
talked about the data. He said: I am
not a policymaker. Here is the data.
Here is what is going to happen if we
do nothing.
But I think, as the majority leader
said, H.R. 9 does not solve this prob-
lem.
You have heard from my side of the
aisle very genuine arguments about the
cost to the economy, the fact that we
have reduced our emissions but coun-
tries like China and India have doubled
theirs. We want to get something done
to solve this crisis, and I admit it is a
crisis.
This bill is a messaging bill. It is a
feel-good bill. It won’t get through the
Senate. It will be vetoed by the White
House. I submit to all those listening
to this debate that when that happens,
we work on something real, that is bi-
partisan.
We heard the ranking member from
the new House Select Committee on
the Climate Crisis say that he found
out about this bill in the press. That is
no way to lead a bipartisan effort in
the Congress.
So when this fails, and it will, I sub-
mit we go back to the drawing board
and do things that we know do work,
and that is let’s work on innovation,
clean energy technologies, and, yes,
nuclear power.
We are showing we are being a leader
reducing our emissions while other
countries are not. Let’s lead by exam-
ple. Let’s come back with some real
legislation that is going to make a dif-
ference, reduce emissions, and get us
out of this crisis.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Chairman, in closing, let me say
that I am very glad that the Foreign
Affairs Committee has jurisdiction
over this bill.
I would also like to note for the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD that we have three
additional Members who intended to
cosponsor H.R. 9, Congresswoman KAP-
TUR, Congresswoman GABBARD, and
Congresswoman UNDERWOOD.
Let me also say that I include in the
RECORD 9 letters in support of H.R. 9.
Specifically, I have letters from a
group of four dozen environmental or-
ganizations led by Oxfam; the Sierra
Club; the Union of Concerned Sci-
entists and others; the League of Con-
servation Voters; The Wilderness Soci-
ety; EDF Action, which is an advocacy

DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of our
millions of members and supporters across
the country, we urge you to support H.R. 9,
the Climate Action Now Act, to ensure the
U.S. meets its commitments under the Paris
Agreement and to reinforce our national re-
solve to address climate change.
The Paris Agreement is a global response
to the greatest environmental challenge of
our time. It includes, for the first time, spe-
cific commitments from all major countries
and a pathway for each country to strength-
en its own domestic climate actions in the
years ahead. United States leadership and

participation was crucial in bringing the
world together to act. But now, by threat-
ening to exit the agreement, the Trump ad-
ministration risks isolating itself, under-
mining global climate action, and weakening
America’s international influence on a broad
array of critical foreign policy issues.
Americans are experiencing climate
change here and now in a rising tide of ex-
treme weather disasters, from hurricanes in
the southeast, to wildfires in the west, to
flooding right now in the country’s heart-
land. It’s no surprise that polls consistently
show that concern over the climate crisis is
rising across generational, geographic, and
partisan lines.
Americans’ personal experience is under-
scored by a raft of new scientific reports.
Last fall the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) confirmed that cli-
mate change is already happening, and ambi-
tious action to curb carbon pollution is need-
ed starting now to stave off steadily wors-
ening impacts in the U.S. and across the
globe. The last four years have been the hot-
test on record since global measurements
began in 1880, according to the National Oce-
anic and Atmospheric Administration and
the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration. And the National Climate Assess-
ment—prepared by 13 federal agencies and
released by the Trump Administration last
year—lays out the stark reality of current
climate impacts in all regions of the nation
and projects how much worse they could get.
Without significant global action, the Na-
tional Climate Assessment concludes: ‘‘ris-
ing temperatures, sea level rise, and changes
in extreme events are expected to increas-
ingly disrupt and damage critical infrastruc-
ture and property, labor productivity, and
the vitality of our communities.’’ ‘‘[C]oastal
economies and property are already at risk,’’
especially communities disproportionately
comprised of low-income and minority
Americans. In short, climate change is al-
ready here in America and it’s already harm-
ing Americans’ lives.
Despite these dire forecasts, we can still
stave off the worst effects of climate change.
Congressional leadership is more important
than ever, and the Climate Action Now Act
will go a long way to ensure that the United
States fulfills our commitments under the
Paris Agreement and stays on the path to se-
rious action on climate change.
This legislation demonstrates leadership
and vision needed to tackle the climate cri-
sis. We urge you to support the Climate Ac-
tion Now Act to help make the future cli-
mate safe for our children and grandchildren
and honor America’s commitments to help
confront this global challenge.

Re Support H.R. 9, Climate Action Now Act.
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: The League of Con-
servation Voters (LCV) works to turn envi-
ronmental values into national priorities.
Each year, LCV publishes the National Envi-
ronmental Scorecard, which details the vot-
ing records of members of Congress on envi-
ronmental legislation. The Scorecard is dis-
tributed to LCV members, concerned voters
nationwide, and the media.
We write in strong support of H.R. 9, the
Climate Action Now Act. This important leg-
islation honors America’s commitments to
the Paris Climate Agreement, recognizes the
urgency of tackling climate change, and lays
the groundwork for further action.
Climate change is already having dev-
astating impacts on communities across the
country and the world. More extreme
storms, record-breaking floods, and raging
wildfires are hurting our families and even
taking people’s lives. It is unacceptable that
these impacts and the burden of toxic pollu-
tion hit lower income, communities of color,
and Indigenous peoples first and worst. Poll
after poll shows that an overwhelming ma-
jority of voters—across ideological lines—
want strong action on clean energy and cli-
mate solutions.
H.R. 9 is a strong rebuke of the Trump Ad-
ministration’s denial of the climate crisis,
efforts to undermine progress, and ill-con-
ceived decision to become the only country
in the world to reject the landmark Paris
Climate Agreement. In response to this utter
failure of leadership, governors, mayors, uni-
versities, businesses, faith leaders, and inves-
tors are stepping up to support climate ac-
tion to meet this agreement.
This momentum is only growing. Just this
year, six new governors have joined the U.S.
Climate Alliance, bringing the total to 23
states and territories committed to meeting
the Paris Climate Agreement’s goals. New
Mexico Governor Lujan Grisham signed into
law legislation that moves the state’s elec-
tricity to 100% carbon free by 2045. Gov-
ernors Walz (MN), Evers (WI), and Mills (ME)
have all announced plans to move their state
to 100% clean energy. After passing both
chambers unanimously, Nevada Governor
Sisolak signed into law legislation moving
the state to 50% renewable energy by 2030.
The Washington state legislature just passed
a 100% clean energy bill, the Maryland legis-
lature passed a 50% clean energy bill by 2030,
and a comprehensive 100% clean energy
package has been introduced in Illinois.
After eight years of the Republican leader-
ship in the U.S. House taking us backwards
in the fight against climate change, we are
thrilled to see this important first step in
the right direction and LCV urges you to
SUPPORT H.R. 9. We will strongly consider
including votes on this bill in the 2019 Score-
card. If you need more information, please
call my office and ask to speak with a mem-
ber of our government relations team.

Hon. GREG WALDEN,
Ranking Member, House Committee on Energy

DEAR CHAIRMAN PALLONE, RANKING MEM-
BER WALDEN, AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE
COMMITTEE ON ENERGY & COMMERCE: On be-
half of The Wilderness Society’s over one
million members and supporters, I write in
support of H.R. 9, The Climate Action Now
Act. This legislation would take a necessary
and welcome step to reestablish the United
States as a global leader and to tackle cli-
mate change at the scale required to avert
the worst impacts of this crisis. The Wilder-
ness Society urges you to vote for H.R. 9
when it is marked up in committee later this
week.
Climate change represents the greatest
threat facing our public lands and the com-
munities that depend on them, from Amer-
ica’s thawing Arctic to regions devastated by
extreme drought and wildfire. President
Trump’s decision to withdraw the United
States from the Paris Agreement on climate
change was a misguided step back from the
kind of leadership the world expects of
America. By deliberately undermining the
global agreement and reversing policies to
address U.S. emissions, President Trump has
moved the United States and the world in
the wrong direction at precisely the moment
we need accelerated progress. H.R. 9 rep-
resents a much-needed step to confront the
climate crisis by taking steps to prevent for-
mal withdrawal from the Paris Agreement
and requiring the Administration to develop
a plan to meet national greenhouse gas tar-
gets.
The Wilderness Society believes that our
640 million acres of public lands can and
must play a prominent role in addressing cli-
mate change in a comprehensive, sustainable
and equitable way. We have a significant op-
portunity to reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions from fossil fuel energy development on
public lands, which currently accounts for
more than 20% of all U.S. emissions, and sup-
port responsibly-sited renewable energy
projects. We must also protect large, con-
nected landscapes, including our forests,
deserts and other wild places that can help
species adapt, store carbon, and provide nat-
ural infrastructure to safeguard commu-
nities from intensifying storms and extreme
weather events. H.R. 9 takes an important
first step in establishing a framework that
allows for our public lands to be part of the
climate solution, and no longer a significant
contributor to the United States’ carbon
footprint.
The Wilderness Society looks forward to
seeing passage of this bill, without amend-
ment, as a first step in solving the climate
crisis, and we welcome the opportunity to
work with Congress to make public lands
part of our national solution to climate
change.
Sincerely,
DREW MCCONVILLE,
Senior Managing Di-
rector of Government
Relations, The Wil-
derness Society.

[From EDF Action]
H.R. 9: THE CLIMATE ACTION NOW ACT
The Climate Action Now Act is a much-
needed step toward reasserting American
global leadership in the fight to solve cli-
mate change.
This bill gives Congress the opportunity to
take common sense action against one of our
country’s most dangerous threats.
We need immediate action to reduce cli-
mate pollution and move our country toward
100% clean energy across the economy by
2050.
Taking action on climate change is nec-
essary to:
Protect our health and our kids’ future,
Strengthen the U.S. economy through in-
novation and investment,
Protect against trillions of dollars in dam-
ages,
Allow America to lead the next techno-
logical and energy revolution.
WHAT IS THE PARIS AGREEMENT?
In 2015 in a historic breakthrough, vir-
tually every country in the world came to-
gether and committed to addressing climate
change by reducing emissions. The an-
nouncement, known as Paris Agreement, al-
lows each country to make its own plan to
fight pollution.
A recommitment to the goals of the Paris
Agreement would show the world that Amer-
ica takes its promise to cut pollution seri-
ously, encourage other nations to honor
their climate pledges as well, and give Amer-
ica a stronger voice in ongoing climate nego-
tiations.
AMERICANS SUPPORT CLIMATE ACTION
The Trump administration has surrendered
American leadership in the fight against cli-
mate change, isolating our country, and ig-
noring two-thirds of Americans who support
climate action.
Recommitting to the Paris Agreement
goals follows the lead of the over 3,500 elect-
ed officials, and tribal, university, busi-
nesses, and faith leaders, representing mil-
lions of Americans, who have pledged to con-
tinue to support climate action.
BLUEGREEN ALLIANCE,
April 30, 2019.
Re BlueGreen Alliance Supports H.R. 9, Cli-
mate Action Now Act.
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: As a coalition of
the nation’s largest labor unions and envi-
ronmental groups, collectively representing
millions of members and supporters, we
write to express the BlueGreen Alliance’s
support for H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now
Act.
The United States’ adoption of the Paris
Agreement was an historic step to lead in
the fight against global climate change. The
Trump Administration’s stated intention to
withdraw from this agreement is a mistake
with dire consequences for the United States
and the rest of the world. The effects of cli-
mate change are already being felt in com-
munities across the country in the form of
more frequent and severe extreme weather
events, wildfires, droughts, and rising sea
levels.
Removing the United States from the
Agreement would be an abdication of our na-
tion’s responsibility to the world and to fu-
ture generations to lead in the fight against
climate change. Our country can and should
lead the world in driving the significant eco-
nomic growth and job creation that can re-
sult from clean energy technologies and in-
frastructure required to reduce climate
change-driving pollution. The Paris Agree-
ment holds all countries accountable for
their emissions, and is a critical tool at our
disposal to create a level playing field for
U.S.-based manufacturing in the race against
our global economic competitors to build the
clean technologies of the future.
America is currently meeting the chal-
lenge of making our energy, transportation,
and other systems cleaner and more effi-
cient. We have already begun putting mil-
lions of people to work in jobs designing,
manufacturing, and installing the clean en-
ergy technology and infrastructure needed to
reduce the pollution that is driving climate
change. At the same time, we must ensure
that the jobs we’re building in new clean
technologies are quality, family-sustaining
jobs. Additionally, we must address the chal-
lenges of this transition to ensure that no
communities or workers are left behind by
making available the tools and resources for
workers to transition to new, good jobs and
for communities to diversify their local and
regional economies and create new opportu-
nities.
Ultimately, we have everything we need to
meet our commitment made in the Paris
Agreement. American innovation has the po-
tential to lead the world in solving our envi-
ronmental problems while creating good jobs
for workers.
The Climate Action Now Act recognizes
this reality and would block President
Trump’s dangerous threat to remove the
United States from the Paris Agreement and
require the Administration to create a plan
that demonstrates how the U.S. will go
about meeting our commitments for climate
change mitigation. By addressing climate
change the right way—with investments in
infrastructure and job training, and devel-
oping technologies of the future—our coun-
try can lead the world in driving the signifi-
cant economic growth and job creation that
comes from the design, manufacturing, and
installation of the clean energy economy.
For these reasons, BlueGreen Alliance urges
Congress to swiftly pass this legislation.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
MICHAEL WILLIAMS,
Interim Co-Executive Director,
BlueGreen Alliance.
UNITED STEELWORKERS,
April 2, 2019.
Re United Steelworkers support H.R. 9, Cli-
mate Action Now Act.
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the
850,000 members of the United Steelworkers
(USW), we urge you to support the Climate
Action Now Act (H.R. 9). This simple and
straightforward legislation prevents the
Trump Administration from withdrawing
from the Paris Agreement and requires a
plan for the United States to meet its emis-
sions targets.
In our union’s 1990 report titled Our Chil-
dren’s World, we stated that, ‘‘[Climate
change] may be the single greatest problem
we face.’’ The situation has become more ur-
gent, and for many years the United States
has been a leader in innovation and tech-
nology to combat this crisis.
The Paris Agreement is an ambitious, non-
binding, and transparent achievement in the
global fight against climate change. The
President’s 2017 announcement of his intent
to withdraw was reckless and opposed by
labor, environmental, and business leaders.
Withdrawal would be an inexcusable blow to
the U.S. economy, as the diplomatic and
trade impacts would be felt for years.
We applaud the House Democratic Leader-
ship for introducing H.R. 9 to reverse this
Administration’s decision. We urge all mem-
bers to support the Climate Action Now Act
(H.R. 9).
Sincerely,
LEO W. GERARD,

Washington, DC.
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY,
Minority Leader, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCAR-
THY: We are members of the Leaders Circle of
the largest coalition ever assembled for cli-
mate action in the United States, and are
among the over 3,750 U.S. businesses, cities,
states, tribes, colleges and universities, in-
vestors, faith groups, cultural institutions,
and health care organizations who declared
‘‘We Are Still In’’ the Paris Agreement and
the fight against climate change.
Since We Are Still In launched two years
ago, more and more American leaders have
stepped forward to declare their support for
the global solution to climate change. Our
3,750 signatories come from all fifty states,
represent half of the U.S. population and
over half of the U.S. economy.
In that time, the science around climate
change has only become increasingly clear.
Last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change detailed the dire global con-
sequences of allowing global temperature in-
creases to exceed 2.7° F/1.5° C. Similarly, the
National Climate Assessment detailed that
the impacts of climate change are already
impacting every place and walk of life in the
United States. Our future is at stake.
For these reasons, we endorse H.R. 9: Cli-
mate Action Now Act, which advances our
commitment to address climate change and
support the Paris Agreement, and hope that
leaders from both sides will choose to stand
behind the legislation. It is in America’s best
interest to improve our global leadership and
reputation on this issue by honoring our con-
tribution to the Paris Agreement.
For our part, we will continue our commit-
ment to tackling climate change by reducing
our emissions and working together for a
broad transformation of the U.S. economy.
We look forward to welcoming strong, smart,
national policies to address the climate chal-
lenge while unleashing substantial economic
and public health benefits.

DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the
NAACP, our nation’s oldest, largest and
most widely-recognized grassroots-based
civil rights organization, I strongly urge you
to support and vote in favor of H.R. 9, the
Climate Action Now Act. The earth’s climate
is now changing faster than at any point in

the history of modern civilization, primarily
as a result of human activities, and as the ef-
fects of climate change intensify, so too will
the stark differences in consequences experi-
enced by the privileged and the disadvan-
taged. Low-income populations and in Amer-
ica people of color will suffer more dire re-
percussions because of climate change.
From Hurricane Katrina in 2005, to the
more recent flooding in Houston due to Hur-
ricane Harvey in 2017, as well as numerous
other weather-related catastrophes including
heat waves, hurricanes, cyclones, and floods
we have witnessed the inconceivable loss of
life and property that can be caused by more
dangerous weather systems. The increased
ferocity of these storms is but one result of
climate change, yet it perhaps offers us the
best insight into its disparate impact. Low
income Americans and racial and ethnic mi-
norities have fewer resources with which
they can prepare for, defend against, or use
to clean up after a disaster.
While H.R. 9 does not offer the resources
which are necessary to defend against a cri-
sis situation, it does make it less likely that
we will be faced with catastrophes on the
scale to which we are growing sadly increas-
ingly accustomed. Specifically, H.R. 9 would
require that the United States remain a
partner in and part of the 2016 Paris agree-
ment on climate change. The United States
was once a global leader in pushing for cli-
mate action, but we have recently lost our
way. As a result, our progress and that of
some other nations in reducing emissions
has dwindled and is now reversing itself.
There is not time to waste: we need to take
decisive action to address this increasing
problem while we still can. It is not an un-
derstatement to say that our future depends
upon it. Please support and vote for H.R. 9,
the Climate Action Now Act, and urge your
colleagues in the other body, as well, as the
President, to take the threat of climate
change seriously. Should you have any ques-
tions or comments, please do not hesitate to
contact me at my office.
Sincerely,
HILARY O. SHELTON,
Director, NAACP Washington Bureau and
Senior Vice President for Policy and
Advocacy.
APRIL 29, 2019.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: The undersigned
public health and medical organizations urge
you to support H.R. 9, the Climate Action
Now Act. The bill would help ensure that the
United States adheres to the science-based
targets in the Paris Agreement and develops
a plan to meet them, both essential steps to
protecting public health from the impacts of
climate change.
Climate change is a public health emer-
gency. The science clearly shows that com-
munities across the nation are experiencing
the health impacts of climate change, in-
cluding enhanced conditions for ozone and
particulate air pollution, which cause asth-
ma attacks, cardiovascular disease and pre-
mature death; increased instances of ex-
treme heat, severe storms and other desta-
bilizing weather patterns that disrupt peo-
ple’s access to essential healthcare; in-
creased spread of vector-borne diseases; and
longer and more intense allergy seasons.
These threats are no longer hypothetical,
and Americans across the country have expe-
rienced them firsthand.
Every American’s health is at risk due to
climate change, but some populations are at
greater risk, including infants, children, sen-
iors, pregnant women, low-income commu-
nities, some communities of color, people
with disabilities and many people with
chronic diseases. Evidence and experience
shows that these populations will dispropor-
tionately bear the health impacts of climate
change without concerted action to both
mitigate and adapt to climate change.
The science is also clear that limiting in-
crease in global temperatures to no more
than 1.5 degrees Celsius is essential. The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
found dramatic differences in health impacts
between 1.5 and 2 degrees, including in heat-
related morbidity and mortality, ozone-re-
lated mortality, and vector-borne diseases.
The Paris Agreement’s goals are to keep the
world well under 2 degrees Celsius and to
pursue efforts to further stay below 1.5 de-
grees.
H.R. 9 is an important step toward what
must become a comprehensive set of policies
protect public health from the worst impacts
of climate change. The nation urgently needs
to implement strong, science-based measures
to reduce the emissions that cause climate
change. The U.S. must also invest in health
adaptation strategies to help communities
address the varied health impacts they are
already facing.
On behalf of the patients and communities
we serve, we urge you to vote YES on H.R. 9,
the Climate Action Now Act.

Mr. ENGEL. I think that it is very
clear to say that this is a broad-based
bill, and I do hope that we will pass it.
We have the ability to work together
to do it.
I thank the ranking member for his
offer to work together. We have a tra-
dition of doing that on the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee, and we will do it
again.
But climate change, global warming,
is a factor. We can put our heads in the
sand like an ostrich and pretend it is
not there, but it is there and it is big;
and if we don’t do something about it
soon, we are all going to pay the price
in the future.
Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote for
this important bill, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I rise in strong support of H.R. 9, the
Climate Action Now Act.
President Trump’s decision to with-
draw from the Paris Agreement is un-
justified and, I believe, dangerous. It
abdicates U.S. leadership on climate
action and puts the health and safety
of our communities at great risk. It
also jeopardizes our national and eco-
nomic security.
We can’t live in the past. China, the
EU, and others are moving towards a
low-carbon economy, building solar
panels, wind turbines, and cornering
the market on renewable industries.
We can and should be a leader in that
transition so that our industries, our
workers, and our communities benefit
from the new opportunities created.
The United States has always been at
the forefront in the creation of new
technologies and new jobs; but, rather
than leading right now, President
Trump and his administration are sim-
ply sticking their heads in the sand,
acting like this is the 19th century.
We have to be future oriented, not
live in the past, or we will simply be
left behind.
The President is actually making the
climate crisis worse. The Trump ad-
ministration gutted regulations to con-
trol methane pollution from the oil and
gas sector, rolled back stronger fuel ef-
ficiency standards for vehicles, and il-
legally blocked improved appliance ef-
ficiency standards.
These actions led to a rise in green-
house gas emissions last year.
Now, back in my district, I want you
to understand, this is not a partisan
issue. Everyone sees the harm climate
change is doing to our shoreline, our
oceans, and the health and well-being
of our residents.
States and local governments are
taking action on climate change. They
are concerned about the health of their
constituents, asthmatics who are nega-
tively impacted by dirty air, cancers
that are aggravated by increased tox-
icity.
I have a lot of Republican mayors
and county and State legislators, and I
don’t know one of those Republican
mayors or elected officials who thinks
that the Federal Government should
withdraw from climate action.
It is the cost of inaction that is real-
ly painful. We have all seen them. In
2017, the United States experienced 16
natural disasters with costs totaling
$360 billion. Superstorm Sandy hit my
district very hard.
But I want to say that we still have
time to avoid a deeper climate crisis,
while strengthening and modernizing
our economy at the same time, and
H.R. 9 is an important step in that re-
gard.
So—please—I call on my colleagues, I
beg my colleagues, let’s take this op-
portunity to prevent the withdrawal
from the Paris Agreement and, at the
same time, call upon this administra-
tion to come up with ways of achieving
the goal of the Paris Agreement.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, clearly, today is, un-
fortunately, more about the politics of
climate change than actually rolling
up our sleeves and getting to work on
American solutions.
Climate change is real, but address-
ing climate change should not involve
binding ourselves to international
agreements that put United States
workers and jobs at a disadvantage to
our main competitors around the world
and with no regard to the cost for
American consumers and ratepayers.
We should have a serious, solutions-
oriented discussion about how to ad-
dress climate change risks through

American innovation, American con-
servation, and preparation.
But we all know that long-term, sus-
tainable policy is best developed
through a thoughtful, logical, and
strong bipartisan process. That is the
approach we have taken over the last
several Congresses as Republicans and
one I think we should continue in this
Congress.
In fact, in the last Congress, Repub-
licans worked with Democrats to re-
move regulatory barriers to new tech-
nological advances in power genera-
tion, from hydropower to small mod-
ular nuclear, from tax policies that ac-
tually encourage carbon capture and
storage to reforms of the Nation’s elec-
tric grid.
There are many bipartisan policies
Congress could further pursue to accel-
erate innovation and to create indus-
trial, electrical, and technological in-
frastructure that actually will enable
cleaner energy systems for the future;
such as, furthering advanced nuclear
reactor technologies, easing the per-
mitting of clean-energy infrastructure,
and modernizing our electric grid.
We need to do all of those, Mr. Chair-
man.
We can also look to better manage-
ment of our Federal forests to reduce
the risk of catastrophic wildfires,
which choke the communities, like
those in my home State of Oregon,
with smoke and fill our atmosphere
with untold pollutants.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Cli-
mate Change found that sustainably
managing our Federal forests—in fact,
all forests—will create the longest sus-
tained carbon mitigation benefit.
Those are the findings of the U.N.
IPCC.
But H.R. 9, it just does not represent
that kind of bipartisan policy that we
should be considering today. This bill
is being considered, frankly, without
the benefit of regular order in any com-
mittee of jurisdiction. It has no com-
panion in the United States Senate.
H.R. 9 represents the Democrats’ re-
flexive response to the President’s
June 1, 2017, announcement that the
U.S. would withdraw from the Paris
Agreement.
Now, the Obama administration’s
commitments in Paris were made with-
out a clear plan to even meet those
provisions, without a full view of the
costs to American consumers, and cer-
tainly without a strategy that had
broad bipartisan support from Con-
gress.
Further, H.R. 9’s unquestioning focus
on U.S. domestic action ignores the
evidence that the bulk of the future
global emissions growth will be in
China, it will be in India and the rest of
the developing world.
If implemented, it would lock in the
United States to expensive commit-
ments that will harm consumers; our
communities; and, frankly, our eco-
nomic security.
Republicans offered a number of
amendments to debate these matters,
but, unfortunately, most of those
amendments were rejected by Demo-
crats.
If my colleagues on the other side of
the aisle are serious about reducing
emissions and addressing other climate
change risks, and doing so quickly,
they would acknowledge the reality of
global energy needs. They would ac-
knowledge that the United States is re-
ducing greenhouse gas emissions
through innovation and through tech-
nological development, frankly, better
than any country on the planet.
That is what we are doing as Ameri-
cans. That is what we do. We innovate.
We lead. And we are doing that in
emissions reduction; we are doing that
with new energy technologies; and that
is where we should be focused as a Con-
gress to incentivize those going for-
ward.
Now, instead of spending a week of
precious legislative time talking about
a bill that, frankly, has little teeth,
will never move in the Senate, would
get vetoed by the President if it ever
got to his desk, we could be legislating
on how to ease the overly burdensome
hydropower licensing process.
The Northwest is a great place for
hydroelectricity. We know a lot about
it, and it has zero carbon emissions.
Or we could be passing bills that sup-
port nuclear energy. You look at the
small modular nuclear technologies
that are on the cusp of an energy fu-
ture for baseload power, and you under-
stand just what that could be, with no
emissions.
We could either do that through li-
censing reform or through these ad-
vanced technologies.
Let’s focus on the new technology
necessary for future energy systems,
for future transportation systems, for
advances in manufacturing and indus-
try to emit fewer greenhouse gases.
That is what we should be doing.
Let’s work together on the bills that
are going to lead to ribbon-cutting
ceremonies for new energy infrastruc-
ture or to an American getting a new,
well-paid job in the energy industry.
That infrastructure could be a wind
farm. It could be a natural gas pipeline.
That new job could be as a solar in-
staller, or it could be a nuclear engi-
neer.
I am not talking about picking win-
ners and losers here when it comes to
energy, the environment, or the cli-
mate. I am talking about unleashing
American innovators to do what they
do best, and that is develop new and
better technologies that benefit con-
sumers, benefit the environment, and
benefit the good, old United States of
America.
So we should reject H.R. 9 and focus
on realistic solutions to prepare for the
future and on policies that work for
the American public.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCNERNEY), a member of
the Energy and Commerce Committee,
Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the chairman for allowing me 2
minutes.
We are here today to talk about a
global problem that demands a global
solution. Since the Industrial Revolu-
tion, a significant amount of carbon
has been building up in the atmos-
phere; and, until just recently, the
United States was the number one
emitter of carbon pollution.
As China ramped up its emissions, we
lost that dubious title, but we are still
dumping massive amounts of carbon
into the atmosphere.
This carbon in the atmosphere has
caused energy to accumulate in the
oceans and the skies, and that is now
causing changes in our environment.
And these changes will continue to
grow.
The global solution we need is one
that the United States actually had a
hand in crafting. We led the efforts in
the development and adoption of the
Paris climate accord; but now, because
of this administration’s decision, we
are telling the world to do as we say,
not as we do.
The Paris climate accord is one of
the most comprehensive deals to date
and is a worldwide agreement to begin
reducing carbon emissions. It is the im-
portant first step in the battle to stop
the dangerous spiral of climate change.
If we retreat from the Paris accord,
we are condemning future generations
to a world filled with catastrophic cli-
mate change and conflict.
H.R. 9 will help heal this rift by put-
ting us in alignment with the rest of
the global community and holding us
to standards that we helped put in
place.
My Republican colleagues say they
believe in climate change but have al-
ways refused action.
The Paris climate agreement is ac-
tion. Let’s get with the program.
The United States has led by exam-
ple, so, today, I inform my colleagues:
Adopt H.R. 9. Don’t make us the past
villain for future generations.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio
(Mr. JOHNSON), a very important mem-
ber of our committee.
Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Chair-
man, put simply, this legislation forces
President Trump’s hand to carry out
the goals of his predecessor, but this
administration was elected to tackle
our energy issues differently, our envi-
ronmental issues differently.
Americans asked for this change in
direction. And we got that last Con-
gress, where Republicans worked with
this administration to find creative
ways to streamline the development
and use of all of our energy sources and
technologies.
We examined grid modification
issues, looked at ways to encourage the
creation and adoption of advanced nu-
clear energy, along with creative ways
to encourage new coal and natural gas
technologies.
We looked at how market forces are
driving new energy technologies and

how the Federal Government can play
a supportive role in that advancement,
not pick winners and losers.
I worry that today’s legislation could
bring us back to a prescriptive ap-
proach to our Federal energy policy. It
could cause significant ratepayer hikes
on families and small businesses in
eastern and southeastern Ohio who
simply cannot absorb higher electric
bills.
H.R. 9 was rushed through our com-
mittees. The Energy and Commerce
Committee held no hearings on it, but
simply a full committee markup. Mem-
bers had no time to debate it—only
vote.
E&C Democrat leadership even ex-
pressed frustration over the expedited
pace of this bill.
Because of these reasons and the
issues raised by my colleagues, I urge a
‘‘no’’ vote on H.R. 9.
b 1600
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL), another
member of the Energy and Commerce
Committee.
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today in strong support of H.R. 9, the
Climate Action Now Act, that is laid
before this House now for final consid-
eration.
‘‘The Earth’s climate is now chang-
ing faster than at any point in the his-
tory of modern civilization.’’ This is a
direct quote from the Fourth National
Climate Assessment issued by our top
scientists from across 13 government
agencies.
Sea levels are rising; average tem-
peratures are warming; ice is dis-
appearing; and extreme weather is in-
tensifying and becoming more fre-
quent. And we know that in this Cham-
ber, because we are dealing with the
consequences of the hurricanes, the
fires, too often because of our constitu-
ents that are being hurt.
We know this is affecting the lives of
growing numbers of Americans all
across the country. And even as I stand
here, right now, we have floods in my
district.
Climate change is an urgent, existen-
tial threat we all face, and bold action
is demanded at this moment. We have
to act together, not as Republicans or
Democrats, but as Americans.
We don’t change treaties. We don’t
change things because we have had a
change in who has been elected Presi-
dent. We respect that office. The con-
sequences of inaction are real, and not
only are future generations put at risk
each day if we do nothing, so are we.
This begins by ensuring America
honors its commitment under the Paris
Agreement. Withdrawing is not the an-
swer.
The Climate Action Now Act would
simply prevent the United States from
using Federal dollars to withdraw from
the Paris Agreement; and calls on the
President to develop and make public a
plan for how the United States will
meet its nationally-determined con-
tributions submitted to the world in
2015.
The bill is technology-neutral, so the
President has the flexibility to set cli-
mate policies and marshal renewable
forms of energy. I urge my colleagues
to support this bill.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. PETERS).
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, Presi-
dent Trump has made clear what cli-
mate action he doesn’t like. He doesn’t
like the Paris Agreement, which con-
templated that every nation in the
world would set a target to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.
He doesn’t like the Clean Power
Plan, which encouraged each State to
create its own strategy to lower green-
house gas emissions. And he doesn’t
like the CAFE standards that required
automakers to lower emissions from
cars and trucks.
Now, last month, the President’s own
EPA administrator came to the Energy
and Commerce Committee, and he tes-
tified, and he agreed that climate
change is happening, and that it is
driven largely by human activity.
So the question is, what climate ac-
tion does President Trump support?
And that is the point of the Climate
Action Now Act, which simply invites
the President to tell us his strategy.
Now, there are many options, many
bipartisan options, many mentioned by
my colleague from Oregon, Mr. WAL-
DEN. These are increasing research into
energy storage technologies, pricing
carbon, incentivizing more renewable
energy, requiring or incentivizing en-
ergy efficiency, easing regulation for
developing renewables, developing car-
bon capture and negative emissions
technology, or investing in resiliency
and more.
And we don’t even need the President
to draft new ideas. We have got exist-
ing bills from the last Congress and
from this Congress we have assembled
into The Climate Playbook, which you
can find right on my Congressional
website.
Mr. President, we get that you don’t
like President Obama’s climate action
ideas. Now tell us your climate action
plans.
I encourage each of my colleagues,
Democrats and Republicans, to join me
in making that request to President
Trump by supporting and passing H.R.
9. Congress has a Climate Playbook.
Mr. President, tell us yours.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. SABLAN).
Members are reminded to address their
remarks to the Chair.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
3 minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT) to speak on this
matter.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, I
am probably going to be a little dif-
ferent than some of the folks you are
going to have come speak from our
side. I actually, though, like the goal
that we agreed to, or the President
agreed to in 2015.
I believe it is an abdication, though,
of our responsibility to actually build
what the plan is—we will call it the
smorgasbord of options out there—be-
cause, if you think about it, once
again, it is Congress passing the buck
saying, well, here’s the goal; let some-
one else take the blows of it.
So if we are going to have an honest
conversation, let’s say I am a State
that uses heating oil. Heating oil is
functionally filthy. Okay. Are you will-
ing to encourage that community, that
State, to allow more natural gas ex-
traction, more pipelines so we can ac-
tually hit the numbers? Or is it easier
passing it on to the White House to let
them take the slings and arrows of
what it takes policy-wise?
If you actually look at the reality,
2015, the year that President Obama
agreed to this, that year, every func-
tioning benefit from all of the solar
that was adopted in 2015 was removed
because of the amount of nuclear that
went offline that year. Are we ready
here to step up and say, hey, if we want
baseload, clean, non-CO, non-green-
house emitting, we are going to step up
and get this nuclear back online, be-
cause it is a type—just that 1 year of
the number of nuclear facilities that
closed equaled every solar panel in the
country that was added.
Are we willing to continue to do as
we did in Ways and Means last year,
moving forward with carbon sequestra-
tion tax credits?
Turns out there is some new amazing
technology of mining CO2 right out of
the air. There is a utility scale, indus-
trial scale facility going up in Canada
now that has broken the Holy Grail on
the code on how to do it. These are pro-
growth policies that we, as this body,
should be adopting, not passing it off
to the bureaucracy and the administra-
tion to make the hard choices.
Understand, we did some math a cou-
ple of years ago that, if we would do a
pipeline loop in West Texas to capture
methane flare-off, capture that gas and
make it—utilize it, it had a huge effect
in getting us, like right now, that last
13 points of gap that we have to get in
the next 7 years.
How many of my brothers and sisters
on the other side are ready to stand up
and promote more natural gas, more
pipelines, more tax credit mechanisms
for carbon sequestration? Those are
policy decisions. That is our job here in
the House.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. TONKO), who is the chairman
of our Environment and Climate
Change Subcommittee.

the gentleman from New Jersey for
yielding, and I thank him for his lead-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3376 May 1, 2019
Certainly, as chair of the Sub-
committee on Environment and Cli-
mate Change, I understand the
prioritization that we need to make as
a House with climate change. We are
doing it with this caucus, with the
Democratic Caucus. We have lan-
guished without a policy or hearings in
the committee for quite some time
and, finally, the Democrats are show-
ing their forcefulness.
Global problems require global co-
operation, and we accept this as a
given when it comes to countless secu-
rity, health, and economic challenges.
And climate change will impact all of
these areas, and more.
But global climate action will not
succeed without America at the table,
leading by example. Other nations un-
derstand this, as do thousands of
United States cities, businesses, uni-
versities, and nonprofit organizations.
That is why the ‘‘We Are Still In’’
campaign was formed, and why its
many members support this bill. The
contributions of subnational actors can
achieve two-thirds of our 2025 national
commitment, but we need Federal ac-
tion to fill the gap.
President Trump has made it clear
that he does not appreciate the pre-
vious administration’s policies to
achieve America’s Paris target. There-
fore, Mr. President, we have a very fair
question of you. What is your plan?
Our colleagues on the other side of
the aisle have taken the opposite ap-
proach, throwing up their hands and
saying this bill is a waste of time be-
cause the President would veto it.
I could not disagree more. This vote
will show the American people and the
international community who in Wash-
ington understands and acknowledges
the threat of climate change; who rec-
ognizes the importance of building
global cooperation to address it; and
who will work to enact the policies
that will result in a safer, healthier
planet, a planet that will be safer for
future generations.
Based on the President’s statements,
the answer is clearly, not him. And the
clock is ticking.
I hope next time we are on the floor,
we will be debating concrete solutions
that will lead to meaningful emissions
reductions and accelerate the clean en-
ergy transition. We can start that
process today by stating in clear and
resounding fashion: We Are Still in.
Support this bill.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
21⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON).
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Chairman, at
the heart of America’s economic pros-
perity and unrivaled security is an
abundant, affordable and reliable sup-
ply of domestic energy.
The lion’s share of America’s energy
supply, nearly 90 percent, comes from
fossil energy resources, and the hard-
working energy producers of West
Texas are leading the way. This is
thanks to the great American work
ethic, entrepreneurial spirit, and drive
for innovation.
In the Permian Basin in West Texas,
we went from producing a million bar-
rels of oil a day in 2012 to four million
today, and we are on a path to pro-
ducing 8 million barrels a day within
just a few years.
The blessings of these natural re-
sources have allowed us to become the
most powerful and prosperous nation
on the face of the planet. It has allowed
us to build the largest middle class in
the world; helped us to produce the new
technologies and innovations that have
improved the quality of life and given
us the highest standard of living in the
world.
It has been the lifeblood of this land
of opportunity, where we now have
more jobs than we actually have people
to fill them.
Having an abundant supply of energy
doesn’t just fuel this economy. It also
is an overwhelming advantage in terms
of national security. Energy independ-
ence gives us choices that many na-
tions would be envious of. It allows us
to export that same freedom to our al-
lies and to democracies around the
world.
Forcing our President to stay in this
terrible deal would undermine many of
those advantages, and it would penalize
the American people, and cost hun-
dreds of billions of dollars. It would
cost us millions of jobs.
At best, the Paris Agreement is a
feel-good-do-nothing political window
dressing, at best. At worst, it is a tax
on the middle and working class. It is
a millstone around the neck of our job
creators. And it is a gift to our en-
emies, and we must oppose it.
It would punish the American people.
It would punish our children and their
future in this country.
Look, I want responsible stewardship
of the environment, like everybody in
this Chamber. And I want clean water
and clean air for my kids. But I also
want them to grow up in the safest,
strongest, freest nation in the world.
The irony of this discussion is that
the United States is leading this de-
bate. We are leading in our actions.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman has expired.
Mr. WALDEN. I yield the gentleman
from Texas an additional 30 seconds.
Mr. ARRINGTON. The irony is the
innovations and technology that cre-
ated the shale revolution have already
resulted in significant reduction in car-
bon. Since 2000, the U.S. has led the
way by cutting emissions by almost 20
percent.
We need policies that are not hostile
to America’s main source of energy. In-
stead, we should put forth solutions
that encourage the continued develop-
ment of all energy resources, while set-
ting high and responsible standards for
environmental quality and human
health. And we should carry out this
mission in partnership, not in hos-
tility, in partnership with States and
industry.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, can I
inquire about how much time remains
on both sides?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from New Jersey has 41⁄2 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from Oregon
has 11⁄2 minutes remaining.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon
(Mr. SCHRADER).
b 1615
Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Chairman, I
rise in support of H.R. 9, the Climate
Action Now Act. I am a proud cospon-
sor of the bill and a longtime supporter
of the Paris climate accord.
With the Northwest on catastrophic
fire alert every year, everyone out west
knows full well that climate change is
a real and serious threat that needs ad-
dressing.
To that end, we cannot abdicate the
United States’ very serious responsi-
bility to lead the world in curbing the
effects of climate change. That is why
I have strongly opposed the President’s
reckless decision to withdraw from the
Paris Agreement, which has seriously
damaged U.S. credibility on the world
stage.
The Paris Agreement stresses the
dire importance of international co-
operation in combating the climate
crisis. We must work together with
countries around the world if we are to
achieve any sort of meaningful dent in
greenhouse gas emissions.
I am proud that my State of Oregon
remains committed to the goals of the
Paris Agreement, but one State’s ef-
forts cannot combat climate change
alone. We need the Climate Action Now
Act to keep the entire country com-
mitted to the Paris Agreement.
I urge support for the bill.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
I don’t believe we have any other
speakers on our side, so I will conclude
my comments and then be happy to
hear from the chairman of the com-
mittee.
I think we have had a good debate
here, a thorough debate, and at the end
of the day, it is important to remember
America is actually leading, through
new innovation and technology in the
energy sector, the reduction in emis-
sions. Again, we are leading as a coun-
try.
You look at other countries, com-
petitors of ours like China, wouldn’t
have to begin making reductions until
2030, so they can keep adding emis-
sions-spewing power plants. They could
do all kinds of things until 2030. Mean-
while, we are supposed to shut down
our economy in a lot of ways if you go
down certain paths.
We don’t think we should take that
bargain. We don’t think we have to
take that bargain. Instead, Repub-
licans believe we should continue to
rely on our great innovators in Amer-
ica to develop even new technologies to
reduce emissions and produce power
like we have done in the energy sector,
as my friend from Texas described.
And like my friend from Arizona de-
scribed, there are companies around

the world that are figuring out how to
remove carbon from the atmosphere
and use it for another purpose. Repub-
licans led the effort on tax credits to
say let’s incent you to put carbon into
other use or into the ground, and we
will even give you a bigger incentive to
put it in the ground.
We should be doing more in the area
of advanced battery research, like is
being done at Pacific Northwest Na-
tional Laboratory across the river from
Oregon, and get to where we can har-
ness the renewable intermittent power
sources to more firm power; and the
same with streamlining hydro, with
pump storage.
There is a lot we can do working to-
gether to make sure we have a safe, se-
cure, reliable grid that is adequate to
make all this seamlessly work together
because, at the end of the day, we want
to make sure we don’t have riots in the
streets because you have driven up
costs too high, like they are having in
France today. We want to make sure
that we are creating the jobs and tech-
nology here, because if somebody is
going to lead this effort internation-
ally, it should be us.
Mr. Chairman, this bill is going no-
where after this vote today, and I
would urge opposition.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, I have listened to my
colleagues on the other side of the
aisle, particularly the last two speak-
ers, and it just seems that they are try-
ing to invent something that doesn’t
exist.
They talk about jobs. They talk
about innovation. They talk about the
freedom to let people do what they
want, but what is really happening
here is the Trump administration is ac-
tually trying to force the old ways,
saying, well, okay, maybe coal is not
as competitive as it used to be, but we
will find a way to make it competitive.
We will find a way to say that fossil
fuels have a future where they can be
used even more so.
Government policy has to lead inno-
vation. That is what it is all about.
What we are seeing is that our com-
petitors like China, for example, real-
ize that renewables are the future.
They realize that the fossil fuels and
continued use of coal, for example, are
actually polluting the environment, so
they are taking the lead and they are
creating innovative technologies, and
they are creating the jobs that go
along with it.
A few years ago, if I can use my home
State of New Jersey, when Governor
Christie was first elected, a Republican
Governor in New Jersey, he started out
by saying that he was going to have
wind turbines built in New Jersey. He
was going to have us manufacture solar
panels. He was going to have us be the
renewable center for the country.
Then, very quickly after that, when he
decided to run for President, he
dropped all that and actually pulled
out of RGGI, our regional agreement.
And what happens? The other States
or the other countries, they start de-
veloping these new technologies, and
they then corner the market on things
like wind turbines or solar panels.
More and more of those are being man-
ufactured in China and then shipped
over here. So we lose the competitive
edge that we would have had through
innovation that is essentially driven by
good government policy. Then what
happens is we lose the jobs and our
economy falls behind.
You know, the same thing is true
with climate disasters. My district was
more impacted by Superstorm Sandy
than any other district in the country.
What happens? You know, we lose jobs.
Our tourism economy was destroyed in
the summer because there was so much
damage and destruction. People lost
their jobs; they had to look elsewhere;
their income was reduced.
So this notion that somehow if you
do nothing or if you withdraw from
international agreements because of
your fear of the future, that this is
going to help you, help your economy,
help your jobs, it is not true. It is, in
fact, just the opposite.
I don’t want our country to fall be-
hind. I don’t want us to look towards
19th century solutions while other
countries are looking towards 21st cen-
tury innovations. We can’t be like an
ostrich where we just put our head in
the sand and we assume that every-
thing is going to be the same in the fu-
ture. That is simply not the case.
I don’t care whether it is the Euro-
pean Union. I don’t care whether it is
Japan, China, or India. They under-
stand where the future is. They under-
stand that these new technologies have
to be fostered at the Federal level, the
same way they are being fostered at
the State and the local level.
So let us not kid ourselves and think
that somehow actions in Washington
don’t make a difference. They do. One
of the purposes of government is trying
to find ways to innovate and create
jobs for the future and not rely on the
past, and that is all we are saying.
So we have to send a message with
H.R. 9: Withdrawal from the Paris
Agreement is not good for this coun-
try; it is not good for our jobs; it is not
good for our economy.
Please support this bill. Let us be on
the right path again.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I offer this
amendment on behalf of myself, Congressman
MOULTON of Massachusetts and Congress-
woman HAYES of Connecticut, and express my
appreciation to them for their assistance and
support.
The Jackson Lee/Moulton/Hayes Amend-
ment improves the bill by adding a finding
which emphasizes the importance of inter-
national cooperation and multilateralism in re-
sponding to the global challenges facing the
international community.
The Paris Climate Accord was an example
of the international leadership, commitment,
and resolve that defeated fascism, created
NATO, the European Union, the Marshall
Plan, the World Bank, International Monetary
Fund, and most importantly, preserved peace
and freedom for the last 75 years.
Collective international action is also needed
to combat growing international challenges
such as terrorism, human trafficking, and
black-market sales of illegal weapons, drugs,
and tobacco.
No one country can solve these problems
on its own, and this amendment emphasizes
the importance of collective international ac-
tion.
The landmark Paris Climate Accord was es-
tablished to combat climate change and to ac-
celerate and intensify the actions and invest-
ments needed for a sustainable low carbon fu-
ture.
This also brings all nations into a common
cause to undertake ambitious efforts to com-
bat climate change and adapt to its effects,
with enhanced support to assist developing
countries to do so.
And in these efforts, we promote the impor-
tance of continued international cooperation
that has sustained the global community
through epidemics, famines, and natural disas-
ters.
A collective of rational actors acting in a
selfless manner to achieve a rational result
such as this requires leadership and systemic
reasoning.
Without this type of collective action and
selfless resolve, we leave ourselves vulner-
able to a Tragedy of Commons.
When countries act solely in their best inter-
ests without regard to combatting international
threats, everyone suffers.
That is why a great person and former Sec-
retary of State, Hillary Clinton, so eloquently
said: ‘‘We are stronger together.’’
The Jackson Lee/Moulton/Hayes Amend-
ment reflects this important insight.
I urge support of the Jackson Lee/Moulton/
Hayes Amendment.
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chair, I rise in
support of H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act.
The Paris Agreement codified what many
across the world already knew must be done
to meaningfully address our most serious envi-
ronmental challenge: climate change. Four
years ago, 190 countries came together to
make a commitment. Now, however, the
United States stands alone in its intent to with-
draw from it.
Establishing a commitment to action, not for
some, but for all countries, is the first step to-
wards limiting the worst effects of a changing
climate. Scientific reports like the Fourth Na-
tional Climate Assessment and the IPCC’s
Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 De-
grees, both released at the end of last year,
summarized 50 years of scientific evidence.
These reports concluded that every bit of
warming matters, for our economies, for our
families, and for public health.
I cosponsored H.R. 9 because it represents
a simple, bold, and achievable goal. It lays out
common-sense steps that will lead to a
healthier environment, because acting on cli-
mate change is not only an environmental im-
perative, but a public health and economic
one as well.
Without action, climate change will be cost-
ly. With the right signals from the federal gov-
ernment, however, addressing climate change
can also lead to business opportunities. This

bill sends a signal to the private sector that a
stable framework for action will be put in
place, enabling private actors to invest, inno-
vate, and inspire further action.
It promotes the transition to a clean econ-
omy. And perhaps, most importantly, it sends
a strong and much needed signal to the rest
of the world about the seriousness of the
United States in addressing climate change. It
restores meaningful international engagement.
The United States has been a leader in
global initiatives on climate solutions before
and should be again. This Congress my col-
leagues and I have worked to re-establish the
U.S.’s climate leadership. On the Committee
on Science, Space, and Technology, we have
held hearings examining the findings of major
climate reports, discussing the warming,
deoxygenation, and acidification of our
oceans, and how our interconnected energy
and water systems are stressed by a changing
climate. The House Science Committee has
marked up four bipartisan bills that address
ocean acidification, as well as the Energy and
Water Research Integration Act, which I re-
introduced with my colleague and Ranking
Member of the House Science Committee, Mr.
LUCAS. It instructs the Department of Energy
to incorporate the consideration of water use
and treatment into all of its relevant research,
development, and demonstration programs.
We hope to continue the momentum of dis-
cussion and action on climate change, and
urge my colleagues to support passage of this
bill.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, I include in the
RECORD the following letters of support for
H.R. 9.
DEAR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, Congress will
soon vote on legislation that would compel
the Trump administration to honor and plan
for meeting the United States’ commitment
under the Paris Agreement. We, the under-
signed members of E2 (Environmental Entre-
preneurs), strongly urge you to vote in sup-
port of this bill to ensure that we continue
to focus on actions to protect our climate
and grow our economy.
E2 is a national, nonpartisan group of busi-
ness leaders who advocate for smart policies
that are good for the economy and good for
the environment. Our members have founded
or funded more than 2,500 companies, created
more than 600,000 jobs, and manage more
than $100 billion in venture and private eq-
uity capital.
As business leaders, investors and profes-
sionals from every sector of the economy
who live or do business in every state, we un-
derstand the enormous economic promise
that can arise if the United States leads on
this issue and stays a party to the Paris
Agreement.
Thanks in part to federal leadership, more
than 3 million Americans now work in clean
energy and vehicles jobs. These are residents
of every state who go to work every day in-
stalling solar panels on homes and commer-
cial buildings, manufacturing wind turbines,
and making our homes, schools, vehicles and
offices more efficient. By honoring our obli-
gations in the Paris Agreement, America can
continue to drive demand for innovative
technologies and industries that grow our
economy and create jobs.
Studies show that delivering on the Paris
Agreement would unlock at least $19 trillion
in economic growth globally. The inter-
national clean energy market is already
worth an astounding $1.4 trillion a year—and
set to grow, with America’s share pegged at
$200 billion annually. This economic activity
could fuel an additional $26 billion in GDP
growth in the United States alone by 2020,
which would also provide greater opportuni-
ties for U.S. businesses to lead in emerging
clean economy markets.
The Paris Agreement is good for American
businesses and its workers. Ensuring that we
maintain our obligations under this historic
agreement is a chance to ensure America
leads in clean energy, agriculture, transpor-
tation, infrastructure, technology and other
sectors instead of falling behind our overseas
competitors.
We urge you to vote in favor of legislation
that keeps the United States in the Paris
Agreement and creates a plan for meeting
our nation’s commitments.

Re H.R. 9, The Climate Action Now Act
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE, on behalf of the
Business for Innovative Climate and Energy
Policy (BICEP) network, a 51 company coali-
tion of major American businesses rep-
resenting many sectors across the U.S. econ-
omy, I write to respectfully request that you
vote in support of H.R. 9, The Climate Action
Now Act, which would ensure that the
United States does not withdraw from the
2015 Paris Climate Agreement. As you know,
H.R. 9 will be brought up for consideration
the week of April 29th.
As a network of major businesses based
throughout the United States and around the
world, BICEP sees international engagement
and maintaining U.S. commitments under
the Paris Climate Agreement as critical to
our continued economic success. Climate
change is a global problem and requires a
global solution. The United States cannot
solve the climate problem on its own, which
is why a strong international framework is
required to assure that other countries also
meet their commitments, reduce their green-
house gas emissions, and do so in a trans-
parent and verifiable manner.
Every nation in the world has signed on to
the Paris Agreement, which creates a struc-
ture for countries to submit non-binding,
voluntary targets for greenhouse gas emis-
sions reductions. Only one, the United
States, has announced its intent to with-
draw. Since the development of this global
agreement, the understanding of the impacts
of global warming has only become more
clear. The Intergovernmental Panel on Cli-
mate Change—the world’s foremost body of
climate scientists, has released it’s 2018 IPCC
1.5 Report, which details the consequences of
allowing average global temperature in-
creases to exceed 2.7 F /1.5 C. Additionally,
the most recent U.S. National Climate As-
sessment report projects the impacts that
American industry and communities will
face (and are already facing) from climate
change-related impacts.
Days after the administration’s June 2017
announcement of its intent to withdraw the
United States from the Paris Agreement,
many BICEP members joined other sectors
of the U.S. economy, including states, cities,
universities, faith groups, healthcare sys-
tems, and others to declare that ‘‘We Are
Still In.’’ The now 3,750+ signatories to We
Are Still In include members from all 50
states and represent $9.46 trillion of the
American economy—demonstrating signifi-
cant real economy support for U.S. partici-
pation in the Paris Climate Agreement.
Remaining in the Paris Climate Agree-
ment is essential for the U.S. to retain a seat
at the table, contribute in a positive manner
to international negotiations, and reflect the
deep ambition among U.S. businesses to
fight climate change and protect from the
worst economic impacts associated with a
warming world.
As companies across the United States,
BICEP recognizes that a zero-carbon econ-
omy is necessary to achieve long-term cli-
mate goals and are taking steps in their own
operations to accelerate this transition.
However, domestic and international policy
structures are critical to drive change at the
scale and speed necessary to reflect our lat-
est understanding of the science. Maintain-
ing our participation in the Paris Agreement
is one such policy structure that the U.S.
should retain.
On behalf of the businesses in our BICEP
network, I respectfully request that you vote
in support of H.R. 9, The Climate Action Now
Act when it comes up for a vote.
Thank you for your consideration of this
request. I am happy to connect further on
this issue and answer any questions you may
have. Please do not hesitate to follow up.
Sincerely,
ANNE L. KELLY,
Vice President, Government Relations.
AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS,
LEADING INTERNAL MEDICINE, IM-
PROVING LIVES,
Washington, DC, May 1, 2019.
Hon. KATHY CASTOR,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR REP. CASTOR: On behalf of the Amer-
ican College of Physicians (ACP), I am writ-
ing to express our strong support for the Cli-
mate Action Now Act (H.R. 9), which directs
the United States to uphold its commitment
to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
We applaud your leadership in introducing
this legislation and urge its quick passage in
the U.S. House of Representatives today.
ACP is deeply concerned about the negative
impact that climate change is having on
public health and patients, and that these ef-
fects will worsen without immediate action.
This is an important issue for the medical
community and patients, and we all need to
be part of finding a solution.
The American College of Physicians is the
largest medical specialty organization and
the second largest physician group in the
United States. ACP members include 154,000
internal medicine physicians (internists), re-
lated subspecialists, and medical students.
Internal medicine physicians are specialists
who apply scientific knowledge and clinical
expertise to the diagnosis, treatment, and
compassionate care of adults across the spec-
trum from health to complex illness.
Because physicians are on the front lines
of patient care, they are witnessing—here
and now—the harmful health effects that cli-
mate change can and does have on the
human body. These harmful effects include:
higher rates of respiratory and heat-related
illness, increased prevalence of vector-borne
and waterborne diseases, food and water in-
security, and malnutrition, as outlined in
ACP’s 2016 position paper, ‘‘Climate Change
and Health,’’ published in the Annals of In-
ternal Medicine. People who are elderly,
sick, or poor are especially vulnerable to
these potential consequences. As climate
change worsens, an increase in global tem-
perature and frequency of heat waves will
raise the risk of heat exhaustion. Asthma

and other chronic lung conditions will be ex-
acerbated by increased particulate matter
and ground-level ozone in the atmosphere.
Exposure to infectious disease from vectors
such as ticks and mosquitoes, which carry
the harmful Zika virus, has and will con-
tinue to escalate.
Physicians, both individually and collec-
tively, are encouraged to advocate for cli-
mate change adaptation and mitigation poli-
cies and communicate about the health co-
benefits of addressing climate change in ob-
jective, simple language to their community
and policymakers. For its part, the Amer-
ican College of Physicians is committed to
working with lawmakers, its international
chapters and with other professional mem-
bership and public health organizations
within the United States and globally to pur-
sue the policies recommended in its position
paper. ACP is a founding member of the Med-
ical Society Consortium on Climate and
Health, which brings together 22 medical as-
sociations representing approximately
550,000 clinical practitioners. Just two days
ago on Monday of this week, I joined my col-
leagues from the Consortium to educate
members of Congress about how climate
change affects health and the need to take
action now. In addition, ACP was pleased to
submit its perspective and recommendations
on climate change to the House Resources
Committee earlier this year.
Your legislation represents a vital step in
the fight against climate change, and in
maintaining this nation’s role as a leader in
combatting the harmful impact of climate
change. H.R. 9 prohibits the use of funds to
advance the withdrawal of the United States
from the Paris Agreement and requires the
President to develop and submit to the ap-
propriate congressional committees and
make available to the public a plan for the
United States to meet its nationally deter-
mined contribution under the Paris Agree-
ment.
A global effort is required to reduce an-
thropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and
address the health impact of climate change.
The United States must commit to taking
both a leadership and collaborative role in
developing, implementing, and ensuring the
success of such a global effort and in reduc-
ing its own contributions to greenhouse gas
emissions. For this reason, ACP remains
strongly opposed to the United States’ with-
drawal from the Paris Agreement. Climate
change adaptation strategies must be estab-
lished, and mitigation measures, like switch-
ing to clean, renewable energy and pro-
moting active transportation, must be
adopted.
ACP looks forward to continuing to work
with you in your leadership role on this crit-
ical issue. We stand ready to serve as a re-
source for you and other lawmakers in help-
ing to communicate the harmful impacts of
climate change on the public’s health.
Sincerely,
ROBERT M. MCLEAN, MD, FACP,
President.
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Chair, the people of the
Northern Mariana Islands, whom I represent,
are on the front line of climate change. In the
past year, back-to-back typhoons struck our
islands. Lives were lost. We suffered hundreds
of millions in damage.
No single weather event can be attributed to
climate change. But science tells us that glob-
al warming means more frequent and more in-
tense storms of the kind that hit the Marianas.
And we know the sudden increase in inten-
sity of one of those storms, Super Typhoon
Yutu, just before landfall in the Marianas, is
characteristic of a new normal caused by high-
er atmospheric temperatures and warmer
ocean waters. We saw the same acceleration
of force as Hurricane Michael came ashore in
the Gulf last year.
Today, Congress has an opportunity to act
to slow climate change and reduce the disas-
ters being caused. We can vote to return the
United States to the company of nations that
is working to reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions in accordance with the Paris Agreement
of 2015. I support H.R. 9, the Climate Action
Now Act.
There are those who argue it is too expen-
sive to lower carbon pollution of our planet’s
atmosphere. I point to the disaster supple-
mental appropriation bills this House will take
up shortly and previously passed in January.
If we are willing to spend billions to repair the
impact of climate change on communities
around our nation, should we not be willing to
spend to prevent that damage in the first
place? Would that not be wise?
I make this plea especially for people in the
Marianas and other Pacific islands. We are in-
creasingly battered by storms. As sea levels
rise, our islands are disappearing. And the
coral reefs that protect our coasts and give us
nourishment are dying before our eyes.
We are the front line of the consequences,
yet had little to do with the decades of carbon
pollution that are causing this destruction.
Nevertheless, we in the islands are willing to
transform, just as our nation as a whole must
transform to reduce carbon emissions and
protect our safety in the decades ahead.
A yes vote on H.R. 9 is an important first
step.
The Acting CHAIR. All time for gen-
eral debate has expired.
Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be
considered for amendment under the 5-
minute rule and shall be considered as
read.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 9
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Climate Ac-
tion Now Act’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) In Paris, on December 12, 2015, parties
to the United Nations Framework Conven-
tion on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reached a
landmark agreement to combat climate
change and to accelerate and intensify the
actions and investments needed for a sus-
tainable low carbon future.
(2) The Paris Agreement’s central aim is to
strengthen the global response to the threat
of climate change by keeping a global tem-
perature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius
above pre-industrial levels and to pursue ef-
forts to limit the temperature increase even
further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
(3) The Paris Agreement requires all par-
ties to put forward their best efforts through
nationally determined contributions (NDCs)
and to strengthen these efforts in the years
ahead.
(4) The Paris Agreement further requires
each party to update its nationally deter-
mined contribution every 5 years, with each
successive nationally determined contribu-
tion representing a progression beyond the
previous nationally determined contribu-
tion, and reflecting the party’s highest pos-
sible ambition.
(5) The United States communicated its
nationally determined contribution to
achieve an economy-wide target of reducing
its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 per-
cent below its 2005 level in 2025 and to make
best efforts to reduce its emissions by 28 per-
cent.
(6) A number of existing laws, regulations,
and other mandatory measures in the United
States are relevant to achieving this target,
including the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et
seq.), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public
Law 102–486), and the Energy Independence
and Security Act of 2007 (Public Law 110–140).
(7) On June 1, 2017, President Trump an-
nounced his intention to withdraw the
United States from the Paris Agreement,
which would leave the United States as the
only UNFCCC member state that is not a
signatory to the Paris Agreement.
(8) Under the terms of the Paris Agree-
ment, the earliest possible effective with-
drawal date by the United States is Novem-
ber 4, 2020. However, the United States is
still obligated to maintain certain commit-
ments under the Paris Agreement, such as
continuing to report its emissions to the
United Nations.
SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS TO AD-
VANCE THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE
UNITED STATES FROM THE PARIS
AGREEMENT.
Notwithstanding any other provision of
law, no funds are authorized to be appro-
priated, obligated, or expended to take any
action to advance the withdrawal of the
United States from the Paris Agreement.
SEC. 4. PLAN FOR THE UNITED STATES TO MEET
ITS NATIONALLY DETERMINED CON-
TRIBUTION UNDER THE PARIS
AGREEMENT.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 120 days
after the date of the enactment of this Act,
the President shall develop and submit to
the appropriate congressional committees
and make available to the public a plan for
the United States to meet its nationally de-
termined contribution under the Paris
Agreement that describes—
(1) how the United States will achieve an
economy-wide target of reducing its green-
house gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below
its 2005 level by 2025; and
(2) how the United States will use the
Paris Agreement’s transparency provisions
to confirm that other parties to the Agree-
ment with major economies are fulfilling
their announced contributions to the Agree-
ment.
(b) UPDATES TO PLAN.—Not later than one

AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. ESPAILLAT
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 2 printed in
House Report 116–42.
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 5, after line 19, insert the following:
(3) The Paris Agreement acknowledges
that all ‘‘Parties should, when taking action
to address climate change, respect, promote
and consider their respective obligations on
human rights, the right to health, the rights
of indigenous peoples, local communities,
migrants, children, persons with disabilities
and people in vulnerable situations and the
right to development, as well as gender
equality, empowerment of women and
intergenerational equity’’.
(4) The Paris Agreement notes the impor-
tance of ‘‘climate justice’’ when mitigating
and adapting to climate change and recog-
nizes ‘‘the need for an effective and progres-
sive response to the urgent threat of climate
change’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentleman
from New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New York.
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Chairman, my
amendment today lays before this
House a very simple fact, an undeni-
able fact: Communities of color across
this great Nation and, in fact, across
the world are least responsible for cli-
mate change. They contribute far less
to the carbon footprint of the world;
they don’t drive as many cars; in fact,
they most often take public transpor-
tation. So they contribute less to cli-
mate change, and yet they suffer the
most harm from its impact.
The most vulnerable among us, from
my home in Washington Heights, in
Harlem and the northwest Bronx com-
munities and around the world, are all
experiencing greater impacts and stand
to suffer even more.
At home, I see it in the worsening of
asthma rates among African American
and Latinx children when parents come
to my office looking for help for bal-
looning healthcare costs that they can-
not afford.
I see it with seniors who have an
array of respiratory diseases, in many
cases contributing to long illnesses, if
not death.
I see it in Central America, where ex-
treme drought endangers livelihoods
and has led to violence and outward
migration.
I see it in the Caribbean and even
here in the United States, where cli-
mate change has increased the mag-
nitude and frequency of hurricanes, af-
fecting millions who do not have the
capacity to prepare for worsening
storms and have barely recovered from
one before the next one hits.
I see it in southern Africa and in
south Asia and in small island devel-
oping states, where climate change af-
fects food scarcity and access to clean
water, damaging public health and in-
creasing political instability and re-
gional violence.
Mr. Chairman, in the United States
and around the world, climate change
has an unequal impact on communities
of color because it compounds existing
injustices of racial and economic dis-
parities. This is fundamentally unjust,
Mr. Chairman.
The amendment that I bring before
you today is a very simple amendment,
one that says that poor communities
that are very often communities of
color suffer disproportionately from
climate change, although they do not
contribute more to that ill.
My amendment makes it clear that
the Paris Agreement seeks to address
issues of environmental justice and the
disparate impact climate change is
having and will continue to have on
vulnerable communities and people of
color.
If adopted, I believe it will send a
strong message, a very strong message
that, with this bill, the United States
of America’s commitment to remain in
the Paris climate agreement also
means our agreement to address envi-
ronmental injustices.
When it comes to mitigating climate
change, we cannot forget disenfran-
chised communities. We cannot forget
communities of color. We cannot forget
indigenous communities. We cannot
forget low-income communities. We
cannot forget climate refugees, and we
cannot forget the children who will
bear this burden when we are all gone.
In every piece of legislation on cli-
mate change considered by this House,
in every bill on environmental issues
we pass, and at every hearing that we
hold regarding this important matter,
we must ensure that issues of environ-
mental justice are equally addressed
and that the disenfranchised commu-
nities and communities of color are
heard, because, again, Mr. Chairman,
they contribute far less to the carbon
footprint, they contribute far less to
climate change, and yet they suffer
tremendously. So this is, fundamen-
tally, an injustice.
Mr. PALLONE. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. ESPAILLAT. I yield to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I just want
to say, on behalf of the Energy and
Commerce Committee and the Foreign
Affairs Committee, we support this
amendment. It is a good amendment.
Mr. Chair, I also want to thank Mr.
ESPAILLAT for working with the com-
mittees to make changes to his amend-
ment.
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in

Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chair, I will close

I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Chair, I want
to thank Chairman ENGEL and the
leadership, Chairman PALLONE, for
working with me to advance this im-
portant issue.
I want to, further, thank my col-
leagues who have cosponsored this
amendment and are similarly dedi-
cated to advancing environmental jus-
tice: Congress Members MCEACHIN,
OMAR, JAYAPAL, PRESSLEY, CARBAJAL,
CISNEROS, and MOORE.
Finally, I want to thank many other
groups in my district that continue to
advocate day in and day out for envi-
ronmental justice, a strong and diverse
coalition that I am proud to represent.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.

Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chair, let me first
say, like everyone in this Chamber, I
support human rights and climate jus-

technologies, and promoting innova-
tion.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

that parties ‘‘should strengthen their co-
operation on enhancing action on adapta-

Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Minnesota.
Ms. OMAR. Mr. Chair, I rise today in
support of my amendment to H.R. 9,
the Climate Action Now Act.
My amendment includes findings rec-
ognizing the importance of the Paris
climate agreement’s task force ad-
dressing the impact of climate change
on displacement and the global refugee
crisis.
The United States is responsible for
nearly a third of the excess carbon di-
oxide in the atmosphere today and,
thus, bears more responsibility for the
climate crisis than any other country.
But the climate crisis is a major con-
tributing factor of yet another dev-
astating crisis we are facing today: the
global refugee crisis.
In 2017, more than 60 percent of the
internal displacements in the world
was a result not of conflict but of nat-
ural disasters. Since 2008, an average of
24 million people has been displaced by
catastrophic weather disasters each
year.
Within three of the most vulnerable
regions of the world—sub-Saharan Afri-
ca, South Asia, and Latin America—143
million people could be displaced by
climate change impacts by 2050.
We do not need to look that far from
home to know this. At least 400,000
residents of New Orleans were dis-
placed by Hurricane Katrina for at
least a few days, and many were dis-
placed permanently. A dispropor-
tionate number of them were Black
Americans.
We saw it happen last year in Puerto
Rico when 3,000 people died because of
Hurricane Maria and our current ad-
ministration failed to help them re-
cover.
At a time when climate change is
making droughts and famines worse,
making conflicts fiercer and repression
more brutal, our country is resettling
historically low numbers of refugees.
The United States should be offering
protection and support to climate
change refugees. Instead, we have
capped the number of refugees that we
resettle to only 30,000 people next year.
Citizens of some of the countries that
have been hit hardest by climate
change, including Yemen, Iran, and So-
malia, are currently subject to an arbi-
trary and racist Muslim ban. We can-
not be willing to turn our backs on
those suffering because of the effects of
global catastrophes.
We have to acknowledge that this
tragedy is not going to go away any
time soon. As food security, drinking
water, and energy supplies become
scarcer, more and more families are
going to be forced to leave their homes.
Countries that are responsible for
perpetuating the climate crisis, like
the United States, should rise as lead-
ers in offering protection and refuge for
displaced communities. It is our duty,
as one of the richest countries in the
world, to support the Paris Agreement
and its task force on the impact of cli-
mate change on displacement and the
global refugee crisis.
Mr. Chairman, I ask for support for
this amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chairman, I claim
the time in opposition to this amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman

Ms. OMAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield

Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chairman, let me
first say, again, I agree with the
premise of this amendment. I met
today with U.N. officials on the refugee
crisis. I have been to the camps in Jor-
dan and Turkey, so I agree with the
premise of this amendment. But, again,
it does nothing to reduce our emis-
sions.
We should be debating, I think, bipar-
tisan solutions, such as boosting re-
search, technology, and innovation.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

encourage and assist other parties to the
Agreement to fulfill their announced con-
tributions.

House Resolution 329, the gentlewoman

a Member opposed each will control 5

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania.
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Chairman, I
rise today in support of my amendment
to H.R. 9.
Inaction on climate change will lead
to the demise of the human species.
Science is not a partisan issue, and the
science in this case is crystal clear:
Climate change is happening, and we,
as humans, are causing it.
The amendment that I am offering
today would require the President to
include in the administration’s strat-
egy how the United States will be able
to use all the diplomatic tools avail-
able to help our partners around the
world meet their own goals.
It is simple. Their success is our suc-
cess; their failure is our failure. We all
share the same planet, the same envi-
ronment, and the same atmosphere. We
cannot fight this alone. We have to be
in this fight with every tool available
to us, and that includes our diplomacy.
My amendment recognizes the lead-
ership role that our country can and
should play in addressing global cli-
mate change. This administration has
taken a back seat to facing one of our
most pressing national security
threats, and this amendment puts us
back in the global arena, leading this
vital charge.
Some naysayers and doubters have
expressed concern that developing
countries are and will take advantage
of the Paris Agreement, placing the
burden of addressing climate change on
the U.S. This is misleading. The agree-
ment requires all parties to develop
their own plans to reduce carbon emis-
sions. Rather than retreat from that
effort, we should lead it.
I serve on the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee. Just today, Ranking Member
MCCAUL said that we have always been
leaders on the global stage, and when
we are not involved, we leave a power
vacuum. This applies militarily and
diplomatically with respect to humani-
tarian aid and in the case of climate
action as well.
The best way for us to secure the
safety and health of our planet is for us
to be an aggressive leader in the fight
against climate change. Pulling out of
the Paris Agreement would send a re-
sounding message to the international
community that the United States is
not in this fight to save this planet,
and that is unacceptable.
Let us be clear: The fight to stop cli-
mate change is not just a fight to save
our environment. It is a fight for our
economy. It is a fight for the health of
everyone and for social justice. It is a
fight for national security. And, yes, it
is a fight for our children, for our fu-
ture generations, and for humanity.
I introduced this amendment because
the threat is too grave for us, as a
country, to be doing the bare minimum
as laid out in the Paris Agreement. We
must also work aggressively with each
country to combat climate change at
every turn. Inaction is a death sen-
tence for us all.
We have the opportunity before us to
stand up for our fellow Americans and
brothers and sisters around the world. I
am sure my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle and in both Chambers of Con-
gress would agree: This country we call
home and this planet we call home are
worth fighting for.
I served our country in the Air Force.
I believe in this country, and I believe
it is worth fighting for.
Yes, climate change poses one of, if
not the, gravest existential threats to
our country, but its threats are not in-
surmountable.
Just 2 days ago, Pennsylvania be-
came the 24th State to join the U.S.
Climate Alliance, committing to work
toward cutting greenhouse gas emis-
sions in line with the Paris Agreement.
We in Pennsylvania are still in.

new section (and redesignate the subsequent
section accordingly):
SEC. 5. REPORT.
Not later than 6 months after the date of
the enactment of this Act, the President
shall produce a report that examines the ef-
fect of the Paris Agreement on clean energy
job development in rural communities.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentlewoman
from New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER) and
a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New Hampshire.
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr.
Chairman, I thank Ms. CASTOR for her
tireless leadership on this landmark
legislation.
Nearly 2 years ago, the United States
ceded global leadership when President
Trump announced plans to withdraw
from the Paris climate agreement, a
sweeping accord amongst the over-
whelming majority of nation-states to
curb carbon pollution and mitigate the
damaging effects of climate change.
The Climate Action Now Act reverses
this misguided decision by ensuring
that America honors its commitments
to the Paris Agreement and prevents
any taxpayer dollars from being used
to take any action to advance the
United States’ withdrawal from the
agreement.
I am proud to support this legislation
and to offer an amendment that would
require the President to produce a re-
port examining how rejoining the Paris
Agreement will bolster clean energy
job creation in rural communities.
Contrary to the claims that have
been made here today by my colleagues
across the aisle, we have seen the posi-
tive impacts across my district and
across New Hampshire that the deploy-
ment of clean energy can have on our
communities, both for our economy
and our environment.
Our rural communities are home to
some of the hardest working Ameri-
cans who are committed to securing
good-paying jobs to support themselves
and their families. Clean energy jobs
are good-paying jobs.
b 1645
In New Hampshire, a clean energy job
pays 50 percent more than the State’s
median wage.
Rejoining the Paris climate agree-
ment will spur a new clean energy
economy that weans America off fossil
fuels from countries that do not share
our values, protects our environment
by reducing carbon pollution, and cre-
ates good paying jobs.
My amendment is straightforward. If
we are going to rejoin the Paris Agree-
ment, we must ensure that rural com-
munities benefit from the subsequent
job creation and manufacturing. My
amendment would create a framework
for how rural America can thrive and
combat climate change.
We know that rural communities
face unique economic challenges, and
it is imperative that they are not left
behind as we move toward the 21st cen-
tury clean energy economy.
We also know that rural commu-
nities can lead the clean energy revolu-
tion, and I am very proud to represent
five communities that have made a
commitment to use 100 percent renew-
able energy by 2030: Concord, Keene,
Plainfield, Hanover, and Cornish.
I am proud and pleased to offer this
amendment with my colleague, Con-
gressman CHRIS PAPPAS, and I urge my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to
vote ‘‘yes’’ on the amendment and the
underlying bill.
Mr. PALLONE. Will the gentle-
woman yield?
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. I
yield to the gentleman from New Jer-
sey.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I just

mittee chair. I want to thank Ms. CAS-
TOR for her leadership on this issue,
and I want to urge my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to help us to cre-
ate good jobs in our rural communities.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I
didn’t get a chance to come down dur-
ing the debate on the underlying bill,
and the committee, of course, raised
this issue.
The hope is that the President is
going to sign a bill to go back into an
agreement that he already decided to
get out of. So, when the statement is
made—it only reverses the President’s
action if the President signs the bill.
The President is not going to sign this
bill.
So why are we here? Why are we
spending a whole week? I understand
we need to get this climate debate off
our chest and eventually move forward,
and I hope we will do that in a bipar-
tisan manner.
As to the amendment that we are de-
bating here, not bad, I think, trying to
understand the green jobs that will
occur. But I think those of us from fos-
sil fuel areas, coal mining areas, mar-
ginal oil, well, we would probably like
to see an evaluation of job losses that
could occur as part of this.
They are going to tout the job cre-
ation. Let’s look at the areas—and
they touted rural America. Let’s look
at the areas where coal mines will
close, coal-fired power plants will
close, and the economic impact that
will be impacted there.
We are pretty excited about working
with the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee on, as is, I think, the ranking
member of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, conservation, innovation,
adaption. Our focus is going to be:
Let’s affect the carbon dioxide emis-
sions without raising energy costs and
slowing the economic activity.

I think we have one of the best

and we do have an increase in carbon
dioxide this last year because the eco-

Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Chair, I yield myself such time as I

Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an
amendment to H.R. 9, the Climate Ac-
tion Now Act.
My grandsons’ generation will re-
member President Trump’s decision to
leave the Paris Agreement as the day
that he condemned them to a world of
manmade devastation.
Today, we have a chance to change
that. Which side do we want to be on,
the side of future generations or the
side of those who would profit at their
expense?
H.R. 9 mandates that the United
States Government honor the commit-
ments we made in the Paris Agree-
ment.
We also need to protect the rights of
cities and States to go above and be-
yond to meet the unique strains cli-
mate change puts on their regions.
For example, California has com-
mitted to source 100 percent of its elec-
tricity from renewable sources by 2045.
This is necessary, considering the toll
climate change has taken on Cali-
fornia, including historic droughts,
deadly fires, and terrible flooding.
Despite this, President Trump has
tried to make it harder for California
to regulate its own greenhouse emis-
sions. I have offered an amendment to
H.R. 9 that would stop President
Trump from using the plan mandated
in this act to limit cities and States
like California from taking more ambi-
tious action to reduce greenhouse
emissions.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I claim the
time in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I will close
after my colleague yields back her
time.
I reserve the balance of my time
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. GOMEZ).
Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Chair, I rise in sup-
port of this amendment.
I would like to point out that often-
times the opposition party talks about
States’ rights, but when it comes to
fighting for climate, cleaning up our
air and our water, making sure that
people can combat a climate crisis,
then: Do you know what? We are going
to get involved. We are going to stop
these States from doing something
that they have been doing.
California is a leader in combating
climate change—a leader. We have re-
duced greenhouse gas emissions, and
we are on target to implement a lot of
our top goals: 100 percent renewable en-
ergy and carbon neutrality by 2045,
zero-emission vehicles, and curbing
greenhouse gas emissions.
I also, when I was in the State legis-
lature, passed a law that said that
more of the money from greenhouse
gas emission fees must go to the most
disadvantaged and the most impacted
communities of climate change. That
means that not only are we reducing
our carbon footprint, but we are also
giving resources directly back to these
communities.
So let’s not get in the way. Let’s not
stop California’s progress, because it is
a leader for not only the country, but
the world.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. ROUDA).
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Chair, I stand today
as a cosponsor of this important
amendment offered by my colleague
and fellow Californian, Representative
TORRES.
Our State and many others across
the country are showing the world how
to take meaningful steps to meet our
Paris climate agreement commit-
ments.
While the current administration
continues to do everything in its power
to prioritize industry conflicts of inter-
est over the sustainability and future
of our planet, I am proud of the for-
ward-thinking work being done in our
cities, like the ones in my district, in
Orange County, and States like the one
I call home, California. These impor-
tant efforts must not be prohibited.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Chair, if we don’t take an aggressive
step to deal with this problem, our
grandchildren and their grandchildren
will pay the price.
A United States Government report
found that our economy will lose over
$1 trillion dollars by the end of this
century due to climate change. Clean
energy is an investment, not only for
our communities, but for future gen-
erations.
California has over 500,000 jobs cre-
ated within the clean energy sector.
That is about 10 times the number of
coal jobs nationwide. This amendment
ensures that California’s progress and
commitment will not be sabotaged.
I would like to thank the gentle-
woman from Florida (Ms. CASTOR) for
offering this critical legislation.
Mr. Chair, I urge passage of my
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I urge
opposition to this amendment.
Listen, in the transmission world,
other than Texas, no State is alone.
California is in the Western inter-
connect. So we have great support for
States’ rights, but decisions made by
California will affect Nevada and will
affect Arizona.
For example, we have seen how deci-
sions in some areas actually benefit
the fossil energy in other areas, such as
support of fossil and nuclear power in
Arizona for California’s electricity re-
quirements.
The basic underlying amendment
really does nothing to address things
that we would like to support—con-
servation, innovation, adaption—try-
ing to, in a bipartisan approach, ad-
dress the real issue, which is how do we
reduce carbon dioxide emissions in a
way that protects the economy, grows
the economy. We also feel that our citi-
zens are better served when they have
good paying jobs and they are working
versus a risk of not doing that if you
move down an unchecked path.
Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from California (Mrs.
TORRES).
The amendment was agreed to.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3386 May 1, 2019
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentlewoman
from Florida (Ms. SHALALA) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Chairman, since
1950, the sea level in south Florida has
risen 8 inches and it is only speeding
up. By 2030, the sea level in south Flor-
ida is projected to rise up to 12 inches,
and by the end of the century, perhaps
80 inches. If we continue to do nothing
on climate change, my community,
and, in fact, my district, will dis-
appear.
We have a moral obligation to miti-
gate and adapt immediately, as we are
already seeing the effects of climate
change and sea level rise.
That is why I was so heartened when
the international community came to-
gether to sign the Paris Agreement,
and that is why I was so devastated
when this administration announced
the United States’ withdrawal.
The Paris Agreement strengthens the
international response to climate
change adaptation, mitigation, and ca-
pacity building. It is our best, collec-
tive effort to combat climate change.
The withdrawal from the Paris
Agreement and the failure to act on
climate is a mistake with global impli-
cations and catastrophic consequences
for my south Florida community.
I am proud to support H.R. 9 because
it rejects the decision to withdraw
from Paris and requires the President
to develop a plan to meet the United
States’ commitment under the agree-
ment.
My amendment strengthens the bill
because it makes clear that addressing
climate change means addressing its
effects that are ravaging our coastal
communities, sea level rise, saltwater
intrusion, and flooding.
My region’s drinking water is seri-
ously threatened as the sea rises and
the saltwater reaches further inland
and gets dangerously close to our frag-
ile aquifer.
In south Florida, it no longer takes a
strong hurricane to flood our streets.
They now flood just from a particu-
larly high tide, such as the king tides.
In fact, tidal flooding has become three
times as common in south Florida in
just the past 19 years, causing so-called
sunny-day flooding. We simply cannot
wait.
Coastal communities around the
world, including my south Florida
community, are counting on us. I urge
support for this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE).
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I represent
a coastal district, so the threat of
worsening sea level rise is especially
important to me, so I am glad my col-
league from Florida offered this
amendment.
It is a good amendment and speaking
on behalf of the Energy and Commerce
Committee and the Foreign Affairs
Committee, we support its adoption.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chairman, I claim
the time in opposition to this amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chair, I will close
after the gentlewoman closes.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Chairman, I have
completed my statement. This is abso-
lutely critical to my south Florida
community.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chairman, let me
first say, I agree with the premise of
this amendment. Addressing sea level
rise is a serious issue as well as salt-
water intrusion and flooding.
I am a member of the House Oceans
Caucus, but, again, it does not reduce
our emissions. It is not, to me, ger-
mane to the underlying bill.
I think we should debate, once again,
bipartisan solutions on boosting re-
search, advancing technologies, and
promoting innovation.
I yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Florida (Ms. SHALALA).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 8 OFFERED BY MR. DESAULNIER
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 8 printed in
House Report 116–42.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 8, after line 20, insert the following
new section (and redesignate the subsequent
section accordingly):
SEC. 5. REPORT.
Not later than 6 months after the date of
the enactment of this Act, the President
shall enter into a contract with the National
Academy of Sciences to produce a report
that examines the potential impacts of a
withdrawal by the United States from the
Paris Agreement on the global economic
competitiveness of the United States econ-
omy and on workers in the United States.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentleman
from California (Mr. DESAULNIER) and
a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I
am very glad to follow the previous dis-
cussion that was taking place under
Mrs. TORRES’ amendment, having spent
a long time in California on air regula-
tion as an appointee to the California
Air Resources Board by three Gov-
ernors—Republicans and Democrats—
where we worked in a bipartisan fash-
ion under Federal regulation in the
Clean Air Act, and California regula-
tion, first to improve the air quality
for Californians, but other States that
followed us under the U.S. Clean Air
Act, on criteria pollutants, but now to
do it on carbon.
So my amendment would direct the
administration to work with the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences to evaluate
the negative economic impacts to the
United States’ global competitiveness
and to our workforce by leaving the
Paris treaty.
Our experience in California has
been, by transitioning to renewables
and alternative fuels, one of the best
arguments—of course, secondary to
saving the planet, in my view—is the
economic benefit. So, I hear and I re-
spect some of the conversations and
perspectives from people from different
parts of the country, but that has not
been our experience.
Our experience has been that we
passed a bill in 2006 that I was involved
with in the legislature that called for
the California Air Resources Board to
drop CO2 emissions by 2020 to 1990 lev-
els. We were told by industry that
there was no way we could do that. We
are actually on track to do that.
In fact, the last Governor, Governor
Brown, signed legislation to decrease
our CO2 levels and, again, directed the
California Air Resources Board to im-
plement a strategy to do that in regu-
lations to 40 percent by 2030.
On the renewable side, we went to 33–
1/3 percent, a third of our renewables
by 2020 on the stationary source side,
and the industry came when I was in
the legislature and said: We can’t do
this. We want your help.
We went through with it, and, in fact,
we did it. So now there is legislation
saying that by 2030, we should decrease
it or only have 50 percent renewables.
So what has that done to the econ-
omy? Our economy is the fifth largest
in the world. We get more venture cap-
ital in the United States for renewables
and alternative fuels than the total,
combined research investment in ven-
ture capital in the other 49 States.
We get half of the venture capital in
total in the whole country into Cali-
fornia, and it continues to provide for
transition and new jobs. Many of our
workforce are transitioning from fossil
fuel to renewables.
When we get mass-produced electric
cars—and I am fearful that my grand-
children will drive Chinese electric
cars—but we know that our car compa-
nies are transitioning and being some-
what successful and we hope that they
will continue to be, as General Motors
has indicated it would. It is in our best
interest to continue this movement.
My hope is that we would work col-
lectively with the people who are being
displaced, whether they are coal min-
ers in West Virginia, or refinery work-
ers in the four refineries in my county,
to make sure that they don’t lose out
as the new economy takes over. The
world benefits and the economy bene-
fits. So that is the purpose of this
amendment.
I do want to say that right now, 3.3
million Americans now work in clean
energy jobs; 2.3 million different jobs

are energy efficient; and 318,000 jobs
are in California. The World Bank has
an analysis that says the Paris accord
will contribute $23 trillion to the world
economy.
So on the basis of that and the fact
that there are three times more jobs in
the renewable and alternative fuel
right now in the world than there are
in the fossil fuel industry, I think that
my colleagues should support this
amendment so that we get the facts
from the National Academy of
Sciences, and the administration can
see that what we are supporting not
only benefits the planet and public
health, but it benefits the economy and
the future of American competitive-
ness.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chairman, I claim
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chair, let me say
first to the gentleman from California,
that I appreciate the Californians and
the California tech companies expand-
ing to my home city of Austin, Texas,
but I find this amendment contrary to
the premise of this bill, which prohibits
withdrawing from the U.S. Paris
Agreement. In fact, it withdraws fund-
ing.
So for that reason, I am in opposition
to it, and, again, I think, as the gen-
tleman stated, we should be advanc-
ing—if this bill doesn’t make it
through the Senate, doesn’t get signed
into law—advancing the clean energy
technologies I think both of our States
want to advance.
I yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from California (Mr.
DESAULNIER).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 9 OFFERED BY MR. PALLONE
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 9 printed in
House Report 116–42.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, as the des-
ignee of Ms. JACKSON LEE, I speak in
support of the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as
follows:
Page 7, after line 5, add the following:
(9) The Paris Agreement is an example of
multilateral, international cooperation
needed to overcome challenges facing the
international community, such as reducing
emissions, promoting economic growth, and
deploying clean energy technologies.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentleman
from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New Jersey.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, I am offering this amend-
ment on behalf of myself, Congress-
woman SHEILA JACKSON LEE, Congress-
man MOULTON of Massachusetts, and
Congresswoman HAYES of Connecticut,
and I express my appreciation to them
for their assistance and support.
This amendment improves the bill by
adding a finding which emphasizes the
importance of international coopera-
tion and multilateralism in responding
to the global challenges facing the
international community.
Mr. Chair, the Paris climate accord
was an example of the international
leadership commitment and resolve
that defeated fascism, created NATO,
the European Union, the Marshall
Plan, the World Bank, the Inter-
national Monetary Fund, and most im-
portantly, preserved peace and freedom
for the last 75 years.
Collective international action is
also needed to combat growing inter-
national challenges such as terrorism,
human trafficking, and black-market
sales of illegal weapons, drugs, and to-
bacco.
No one country can solve these prob-
lems on its own, and this amendment
emphasizes the importance of collec-
tive international action.
The landmark Paris climate accord
was established to combat climate
change and to accelerate and intensify
the actions and investments needed for
a sustainable, low-carbon future. This
also brings all Nations into a common
cause to undertake ambitious efforts to
combat climate change and adapt to its
effects with enhanced support to assist
developing countries to do so.
In these efforts, we promote the im-
portance of continued international co-
operation that has sustained the global
community through epidemics, fam-
ines, and natural disasters.
Mr. Chairman, a collection of ration-
al actors acting in a selfless manner to
achieve a rational result, such as this,
requires leadership and systematic rea-
soning. Without this type of collective
action and selfless resolve, we leave
ourselves vulnerable to a tragedy of
the commons.
When countries act solely in their
own best interests without regard to
combating international threats, ev-
eryone suffers. That is why a great per-
son and former Secretary of State Hil-
lary Clinton so eloquently said, ‘‘We
are stronger together.’’
The Jackson Lee-Moulton-Hayes
amendment reflects this important in-
sight by Mrs. Clinton, and I urge sup-
port of this amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.

Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chairman, I claim
time in opposition to this amendment,
but I am not opposed to this amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Texas is rec-
ognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chairman, I will
close once the gentleman from New
Jersey yields back.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
the balance of my time to the gentle-
woman from New York (Ms. CLARKE),
who is a member of the Energy and
Commerce Committee.
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr.
Chairman, I thank the chairman of our
committee for yielding me time.
The Paris Agreement will still stand
with or without the U.S. not meeting
our commitment, and it doesn’t hurt
the Paris Agreement, it just hurts the
U.S. diplomatically and economically.
So it is so critical that we use this op-
portunity to express to the world and
to express to our own Nation that cli-
mate change is a priority for this Con-
gress.
Beyond the diplomatic consequences
around the world, a decision to with-
draw from the Paris Agreement hurts
Americans right here at home. The
U.S. is in the midst of a major transi-
tion to clean energy. As consumers de-
mand access to cleaner energy and
cleaner air, prices for renewables are
falling across the board. With the mar-
ket forces increasing favoring renew-
ables, dirty energy is no longer a smart
investment.
So I want to thank my colleague,
KATHY CASTOR, and I want to thank the
members of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee for continuing
to stand strong and stand firm in our
commitment to the American people,
because ceding the leadership role on
the global stage means losing economic
opportunities in the global clean en-
ergy economy, hurting American work-
ers and businesses.
As we talk about the international
framework, we see China, India, and
other countries would lead if America
does not.
This decision is just another bad
Trump deal for the United States of
America. It won’t bring the coal indus-
try back, and it cedes ground to cre-
ating renewable energy jobs that put
Americans to work.
This is the new industrial revolution
of the 21st century. Let us not cede our
leadership to others around the globe
but let us lead them. Let us provide the
technology that the world will utilize
to make sure that we save and preserve
this planet, not only for our genera-
tion, but generations to come.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chairman, as I
stated, I am not opposed to this amend-
ment. I think the international com-
munity should reduce emissions. I
think the issue is that the inter-
national community is not living up to
the expectations of this agreement,
particularly China and India. While we
have reduced emissions by 14 percent,
they have doubled their emissions, and
they have until 2030 to reduce any
emissions. That is why fundamentally I
think this is a flawed agreement.
But I am not opposed to an inter-
national consensus to reduce emis-
sions. I don’t think this is the right
way to do it.

H3388 May 1, 2019
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise in sup-
port of this amendment on behalf of myself,
Congressman MOULTON of Massachusetts and
Congresswoman HAYES of Connecticut, and
express my appreciation to them for their as-
sistance and support.
The Jackson Lee/Moulton/Hayes Amend-
ment improves the bill by adding a finding
which emphasizes the importance of inter-
national cooperation and multilateralism in re-
sponding to the global challenges facing the
international community.
The Paris Climate Accord was an example
of the international leadership, commitment,
and resolve that defeated fascism, created
NATO, the European Union, the Marshall
Plan, the World Bank, International Monetary
Fund, and most importantly, preserved peace
and freedom for the last 75 years.
Collective international action is also needed
to combat growing international challenges
such as terrorism, human trafficking, and
black-market sales of illegal weapons, drugs,
and tobacco.
No one country can solve these problems
on its own, and this amendment emphasizes
the importance of collective international ac-
tion.
The landmark Paris Climate Accord was es-
tablished to combat climate change and to ac-
celerate and intensify the actions and invest-
ments needed for a sustainable low carbon fu-
ture.
This also brings all nations into a common
cause to undertake ambitious efforts to com-
bat climate change and adapt to its effects,
with enhanced support to assist developing
countries to do so.
And in these efforts, we promote the impor-
tance of continued international cooperation
that has sustained the global community
through epidemics, famines, and natural disas-
ters.
A collective of rational actors acting in a
selfless manner to achieve a rational result
such as this requires leadership and systemic
reasoning.
Without this type of collective action and
selfless resolve, we leave ourselves vulner-
able to a Tragedy of Commons.
When countries act solely in their best inter-
ests without regard to combatting international
threats, everyone suffers.
That is why a great person and former Sec-
retary of State, Hillary Clinton, so eloquently
said: ‘‘We are stronger together.’’
The Jackson Lee/Moulton/Hayes Amend-
ment reflects this important insight.
I urge support of the Jackson Lee/Moulton/
Hayes Amendment.

AMENDMENT NO. 10 OFFERED BY MR. GOSAR
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 10 printed
in House Report 116–42.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 7, after line 5, insert the following:
(9) The Paris Agreement is a treaty and
should be treated as a treaty. Therefore, be-
fore any action can be taken to execute the
goals in the Paris Agreement, the Senate
should approve a resolution of advice and
consent to ratification of the Paris Agree-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentleman
from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Arizona.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today to offer my amendment ensuring
the constitutionality of the Paris
Agreement. The previous administra-
tion refused to abide by the Constitu-
tion and called this an agreement, not
a treaty, despite the agreement having
an impact on every American.
Article II, Section 2 of the Constitu-
tion states that the President shall
‘‘have power by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate to make
treaties provided two-thirds of the Sen-
ators present concur.’’
My amendment simply states that
the Paris Agreement is a treaty, and
before anything can be implemented to
abide by the agreement, it should be
submitted to the Senate for approval.
My good friend from Virginia, Rep-
resentative MORGAN GRIFFITH, said it
best yesterday in our Special Order
when he eloquently stated: ‘‘If we are
going to bind our hands and seal our
fate to be the number two or number
three or number five economy in the
world instead of being the number one
economy in the world, if that is what
we are going to do, then there ought to
be votes taken down the hall. Men and
women in the United States Senate
should put their name on the line and
say yes or no. And the American people
then will know who has voted yes and
who has voted no. They won’t be hiding
behind any games or circumstances or
procedural maneuvers. Then the Amer-
ican people can use the power that was
given to them by our Constitution and
an inalienable right granted by God to
use the ballot box to make a decision
as to whether or not they wanted to be
bound, whether or not they wanted to
have their economy reduced, and have
their children and grandchildren to be
lesser than what we have today in our
economic wealth.’’
Many radical environmental groups
are saying the Paris Agreement does
not need to go to the Senate, that the
agreement reiterates obligations al-
ready contained in article 4 of the 1992
United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change, or the UNFCCC.
This is completely a falsehood.
The Congressional Research Service
has already proven them wrong.
Let me quote the CRS: ‘‘The George
H.W. Bush administration stated that
Article 4.2 of the UNFCCC, which com-
mits the parties to, inter alia, adopt
national policies and, accordingly,
mitigate climate change by limiting
GHG emissions did ‘not require any
new implementing legislation nor
added regulatory programs.’ Perhaps,
most importantly, it stated that an
amendment or future agreement under
the UNFCCC to adopt targets and time-
tables for emissions reductions would
be submitted to the Senate for its ad-
vice and consent.’’
Furthermore, in a subsequent report,
the Senate Committee on Foreign Re-
lations wrote:
‘‘A decision by the conference of par-
ties to adopt targets and timetables
would have to be submitted to the Sen-
ate for its advice and consent before
the United States could deposit its in-
struments of ratification for such an
agreement. The committee notes fur-
ther that a decision by the executive
branch to reinterpret the convention to
apply legally binding targets and time-
tables for reducing emissions of green-
house gases to the United States would
alter the ‘shared understanding’ of the
convention between the Senate and the
executive branch and would therefore
require the Senate’s advice and con-
sent.’’
The previous administration pur-
posely ignored the will of Congress by
refusing to send the Paris Agreement
to the Senate. I often hear Members
from both sides of the aisle lament
about executive overreach.
Here we have a clear case of the exec-
utive branch telling Congress it doesn’t
matter.
If Congress refuses to exercise its
constitutional authority and not de-
mand the Paris Agreement to be sent
to the Senate, then this body is telling
future Presidents that there are no
checks and balances.
Madam Chair, I urge the adoption of
my amendment that preserves the con-
stitutional checks and balance, and I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I rise
in opposition to the gentleman’s
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR (Ms. NORTON). The
gentleman from New Jersey is recog-
nized for 5 minutes.

Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I yield 30
seconds to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. MCCAUL).
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, I strong-
ly support this amendment. It has been
the thrust of our argument.
I support the U.S. Constitution Arti-
cle I authority. This process cir-
cumvented that. I do believe it re-
quired Senate ratification. But not
only that, the President didn’t even
consult with the Congress. There was
not one hearing on this during the
Obama administration and therefore
circumventing the American people.
For that reason, I strongly support this
amendment.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, may I in-
quire how much time I have remaining.

that tell us whether they are an agree-
ment or whether they are a treaty.
So let me highlight just four or five
of these.
Number one, the extent to which the
agreement involves commitments or
risks affecting the nation as a whole.
This obviously impacts everybody
across this country, therefore, ratifica-
tion by the Senate.
Whether the agreement is intended
to affect State laws.
This will bind all State laws, because
they have to fulfill the ratification
based on that activity. So, therefore,
it, once again, has to be a treaty.
Whether the agreement can be given
effect without the enactment of subse-
quent legislation by the Congress.
This agreement obligates U.S. tax-
payer funds to the Green Climate
Fund, which is a slush fund, but it still
obligates those applications and that
money to that fund. Therefore, it must
be fulfilled by a treaty.
Madam Chair, I ask Members to
adopt my amendment, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, we have heard this ar-
gument over and over again. The Re-
publicans said the same thing in the
markup before the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, but these Repub-
lican arguments are not going to
change the facts.
The fact is the Paris Agreement
itself is not a treaty. It is an agree-
ment under an existing treaty, and
that is the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change, that is
UNFCCC, pronounced UNF triple C,
and that was signed by President
George H.W. Bush and approved by
both Republicans and Democrats in the
Senate in 1992.
There is no requirement for the Sen-
ate to approve subsidiary agreements
around already approved treaties.
In fact, the vast majority of inter-
national agreements to which the
United States is a party are not trea-
ties. According to the Congressional
Research Service, more than 90 percent
of international legal agreements
which the United States supports are
agreements that do not require Senate
ratification.
Now, President Obama did not have
to submit the Paris Agreement to the
Senate for ratification for two reasons:
first, because the emissions targets are
not legally binding; and, second, be-
cause the legally binding commit-
ments, which are almost entirely pro-
cedural, generally either elaborate or
repeat obligations under the UNFCCC.
It is also not true that an agreement
with any legally binding provisions
must be ratified by the Senate. There
are many ways in which the United
States can enter into international
agreements with legally binding com-
mitments.
As I previously mentioned, the vast
majority of international agreements
the United States enters into are not
approved by the Senate. Using exam-
ples of that, we have the U.S.-Canada
Air Quality Agreement, the Minamata
Convention on Mercury, and the Con-
vention on Long-Range Transboundary
Air Pollution.
Arguments that the GOP are using,
that the Paris Agreement needs to be
ratified are disingenuous. They are,
frankly, trying to avoid climate action
at all costs. I really find it unfortunate
that rather than arguing on the merits,
that they use these arguments about
ratification that are simply disingen-
uous.
For those reasons, I oppose this
amendment, and I urge my colleagues
to join me in voting against it.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I demand
a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Arizona will be
postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 11 OFFERED BY MR. GOSAR
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 11 printed
in House Report 116–42.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Strike section 3 (and redesignate the sub-
sequent sections accordingly).
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentleman
from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Arizona.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I rise
today to offer an amendment that
strikes section 3 of the bill. Section 3
prohibits the use of funds to advance
the withdrawal of the United States
from the Paris Agreement. My amend-
ment ensures any decision made on the
Paris Agreement will be based on the
merits, not politics.
I have said this before, and I will say
it again: Either the Paris Agreement is
a treaty, or it is not. If it is not a trea-
ty, then the current administration
may independently terminate the
agreement without congressional ap-
proval, as the previous administration
entered into the agreement without
congressional approval.
Makes sense, right?
What one administration does by ex-
ecutive action can be undone by the
next administration by executive ac-
tion.
If the Paris Agreement is not an
agreement entered into by the United
States by executive action and con-
stitutes a treaty, then it should be pre-
sented to the Senate and put on the
floor for a two-thirds vote per Article
II, Section 2 of our Constitution.
b 1730
For the last several years, Demo-
cratic Members have crowed at the top
of their lungs about none of the funds
provisions and forced the U.S. Senate
to agree to only take up appropriation
bills if they don’t include political rid-
ers. Riders have not been included in
the final appropriations bills signed
into law as a result.
Well, folks, section 3 is a political,
none-of-the-funds rider, whose sole
ability is to try and prevent the admin-
istration from doing something they
currently have the authority to do.
The hypocrisy here is outrageous, and
this amendment should pass based on
that precedent utilized over the last
several years alone.
We have heard folks on the other side
of the aisle claim we need to stay in
the Paris Agreement in order to pro-
tect future generations. Americans for
Tax Reform estimates the Paris Agree-
ment will cost the U.S. an estimated
6.5 million jobs by 2040 and reduce our
GDP by over $2.5 trillion.
NERA Consulting estimates those
numbers are even higher, and that the
Paris Agreement will cost the U.S. an
estimated 31.6 million jobs by 2040 and
reduce our GDP by over $3 trillion.
How does killing 6.5 to 31.6 million
jobs and costing our economy more
than $3 trillion protect future genera-
tions? I don’t know.
The European Climate Action Net-
work reported that no single country
in Europe is performing sufficiently to
meet the Paris Agreement goals.
A recent United Nations Emissions
Gap report found that all participating
countries will have to at least triple
their efforts in order to meet the Paris
Agreement’s basic goals.
China and India, the world’s two big-
gest polluters, have said they will not
even consider reducing carbon emis-
sions until 2030 at the earliest, while
we are pledging to reduce our emis-
sions by 26 to 28 percent by 2025.
How does tying ourselves to a non-
binding agreement that puts us at a
competitive disadvantage and that
countries throughout the world are
failing to implement protect the Amer-
ican people?
This is not a partisan issue, Madam
Chairwoman. This is about doing what
is right for America and about pro-
tecting freedom and opportunity for
our children and grandchildren.
If the administration didn’t already
have the authority to withdraw the
United States from the fundamentally
flawed Paris Agreement, then there
should be no reason to include the sec-
tion 3 political rider being debated here
today.
But since the United States Senate
has failed to take up the Paris Agree-
ment and weigh in one way or the
other whether the Paris Agreement is a

treaty or not, this body should not at-
tempt to tie the administration’s
hands with a political none-of-the-
funds rider.
Either you are for the Constitution
or you are not. Either you believe exec-
utive action can be taken to enter and
leave the Paris Agreement or you
don’t.
I urge adoption of my amendment,
which removes the politics from the
bill and allows any decision made on
the Paris Agreement to be based on
merits, not politics.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I claim
the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from New Jersey is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Once again, Madam
Chairwoman, this is an important ap-
plication. Once again, you have to real-
ize that we are talking about the Con-
stitution.
The other side talks out of both sides
of their mouth. They want it one way
when they are in the minority, they
want it the other way when they are in
the majority, and they can’t have that.
This is about the rule of law and
about good policy. Good process builds
good policy builds good politics, and
that is just not what is here today.
So when we start looking at the ap-
plications here, let’s make sure the
American taxpayer, the American fam-
ily, is treated fairly, not put at a dis-
advantage by the rest of the world.
Too often we have taken the short
end of the stick. It is fine for us to
stand up.
And, by the way, if I am not mis-
taken, in 2015, 2016, and 2017 we led the
world in carbon emissions reductions.
Yes, it is that very application of
entrepreneurialism and technology
that has driven that boat. Let’s con-
tinue doing it that way. Let’s get back
to good process.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I rise in opposition to Mr. GOSAR’s
amendment, which would gut the heart
of the bill, the section that prevents
the President from withdrawing from
the Paris Agreement.
Now, the Paris Agreement sets a
strong foundation for action that will
accelerate the shift to a clean energy
economy and put us on the path to a
safer, healthier planet for generations
to come. It is the most ambitious cli-
mate change agreement in history and
builds upon the unprecedented partici-
pation of roughly 200 parties to the
convention, including India and China,
something that my Republican col-
leagues have wanted for many years.
It provides a framework for reducing
U.S. carbon pollution, while also grow-
ing our economy. More energy-efficient
appliances, buildings, and vehicles will
result in lower energy costs for con-
sumers, all while lowering emissions of
harmful air pollutants and keeping our
manufacturing industries competitive
in this global transition towards low
carbon practices.
So, first and foremost, what H.R. 9 is
doing is stopping President Trump’s
reckless withdrawal from the Paris
Agreement, the very agreement our
country was instrumental in negoti-
ating. But this move has real diplo-
matic consequences, further dimin-
ishing America’s credibility around the
world.
Let me be clear, the Paris Agreement
will still stand with or without the
United States; but not meeting our
commitments doesn’t hurt the Paris
Agreement, it just hurts the United
States diplomatically and economi-
cally. Other countries, not to mention
U.S. cities and States, are still moving
forward on climate action, making the
Trump administration only appear
more isolated and irrelevant as the
world moves past us.
But beyond the diplomatic con-
sequences around the world a decision
to withdraw from the Paris Agreement
hurts Americans at home.
The U.S. is in the midst of a major
transition to clean energy. As con-
sumers demand access to cleaner en-
ergy and cleaner air, prices for renew-
ables are falling across the board. With
market forces increasingly favoring re-
newables, dirty energy is no longer a
smart investment.
Ceding the leadership role on the
global stage means losing economic op-
portunities in a global clean energy
economy, hurting American workers
and businesses. China, India and other
countries will lead if America does not.
Leaving the Paris Agreement is just
another bad Trump deal for the United
States. H.R. 9 is trying to prevent this
bad Trump deal from becoming our re-
ality. The Gosar amendment would all
but guarantee that the United States
feels the full weight of the economic
and diplomatic consequences of aban-
doning our friends and allies.
This amendment ensures we lose the
clean energy development race to
China or India.
This amendment locks the United
States and the world into a future of
catastrophic warming that puts all of
our lives and livelihoods at risk.
I said this earlier when we spoke on
the bill: We cannot look backwards. We
can’t look back into the 19th century.
We have to look forward, with new in-
novation, with an economy that cre-
ates more jobs.
Don’t let us fall behind the rest of
the world and not lead on such an im-
portant issue. It is a huge mistake.
That is why we are saying in H.R. 9, in
this bill, that the President should not
be allowed to withdraw and should put
together a plan that leads us forward
toward a clean economy and meeting
the Paris goals.
So, I oppose the Gosar amendment. I
urge my colleagues to join me in vot-
ing against it, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 6, after line 5, insert the following
new paragraph:
(5) The Paris Agreement recognizes that
the ocean ecosystems covering more than 70
percent of the Earth’s surface have an inte-
gral role in climate balance. Seventy percent
of nationally determined contributions
under the Paris Agreement are ocean-inclu-
sive, and 39 Paris Agreement signatories are
focused on the inclusion of ocean action in
nationally determined contributions through
the Because the Ocean Initiative.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentleman
from Hawaii (Mr. CASE) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Hawaii.
Mr. CASE. Madam Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, I rise in support of my
amendment to H.R. 9, which would rec-
ognize the importance of the oceans to
our global climate system and the
international efforts under way to in-
clude our oceans in nationally deter-
mined contributions, or NDCs, under
the Paris Agreement.
When we talk about the impacts of
manmade climate change, we focus on
the worlds of our lands and air, but we
tend to forget the largest world of all,
our oceans. Yet, some of the foremost
negative consequences of climate
change, as well as the positive vital
processes that have kept our climate
on an even keel until recently and can
continue to do so, lie in the ocean.
We cannot forget the oceans. No cli-
mate change solutions can work if our
oceans are not in the room.
The ocean covers more than 70 per-
cent of the Earth and directly affects
weather around the globe. The tem-
perature and currents of the ocean de-
termine storm patterns and strength.
We have seen increases in measures
of intensity, frequency, and duration,
as well as the number of the strong-
est—category 4 and 5—storms since the
1980s.
The ocean also absorbs many of the
most immediate consequences of car-
bon pollution, buffering us from some

of its most damaging impacts. The
ocean has absorbed 93 percent of the
total excess heat energy taken up by
greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Ad-
ditionally, the ocean is the largest sink
for anthropogenic carbon dioxide, or
CO2, absorbing roughly one-third of CO2
emissions.
The increase in temperature and car-
bon in the atmosphere and oceans are
directly impacting communities
throughout the world. According to the
2018 Fourth National Climate Assess-
ment, or NCA, released by the U.S.
Global Change Research Program,
made up of 13 Federal agencies:
‘‘Human-caused carbon emissions in-
fluence ocean ecosystems through
three main processes: ocean warming,
acidification, and deoxygenation.’’
Additionally, the NCA states: ‘‘The
social, economic, and environmental
systems along the coasts are being af-
fected by climate change. Threats from
sea level rise are exacerbated by dy-
namic processes such as high tide and
storm surge flooding, erosion, waves
and their effects, saltwater intrusion
into coastal aquifers and elevated
groundwater tables, local rainfall, river
runoff, increasing water and surface air
temperatures, and ocean acidifica-
tion.’’
In just one compelling instance of
many from around the world, my State
of Hawaii’s oceans and coastlines are
on the front lines of dealing with the
impacts of climate change in our
oceans and coasts.
For example, the Honolulu tide
gauge, a constant for over a century
now, has measured a sea level rise of
nearly half a foot since 1905.
Over 70 percent of our beaches in Ha-
waii are in a state of chronic erosion,
likely caused by a combination of
shoreline hardening and ongoing sea
level rise.
The frequency of high tide flooding in
Honolulu since the 1960s increased from
6 days per year to 11 per year.
We have also seen in Hawaii sea level
rise impact traditional and customary
practices, including fishpond mainte-
nance, cultivation of salt, and gath-
ering from the nearshore fisheries.
About 550 cultural sites, 38 miles of
major roads, and more than $19 billion
in assets will be vulnerable to chronic
flooding resulting from a 3.2-foot in-
crease in sea level. Such widespread
flooding will change the character of
the islands by affecting cultural herit-
age and daily commerce and lifestyle,
and this is chronic throughout the en-
tire Pacific.
We also, in Hawaii, face just one ex-
ample of the impacts of ocean warm-
ing, acidification, on our reefs.
We have seen globally averaged sea
surface temperature increase by 1.8
percent Farenheit over the past 100
years.
We have seen over nearly 30 years of
oceanic pH measurements, based on
data collected from Station ALOHA,
Hawaii, show a roughly 8.7 percent in-
crease in ocean acidity over this time.
We have seen increased ocean acidifi-
cation reduce the ability of marine or-
ganisms to build shells and other hard
structures, adversely impacting coral
reefs and threatening marine eco-
systems.
We have seen extended periods of
coral bleaching, which did not even
occur first until 2014 but now are be-
coming much longer.
This is, again, true throughout the
entire Pacific Ocean. And we are not
alone, because the ocean is inter-
connected throughout our world, and
we are a clear example of what the
world is facing.
These impacts are happening all over
the world and our country.
Madam Chair, 39 countries—con-
spicuously, not including the U.S.—
have embraced the challenges and
promise of our oceans in facing climate
change by signing the Because the
Ocean initiative, which has encouraged
progress on the incorporation of the
ocean in climate change policy debate,
with a special focus on the inclusion of
ocean action into nationally deter-
mined contributions under the Paris
Agreement. The efforts of these coun-
tries and their partners will be invalu-
able as we face the crisis of climate
change.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman from Hawaii has expired.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, I claim

ment.

from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, let me

oceans’ ecosystems, 70 percent of the
Earth’s surface. I am a member of the
Ocean Caucus.
This really has nothing to do with re-
ducing our emissions. It is simply a
finding. We ought to be focused on bi-
partisan solutions and boosting re-
search, advancing technologies, and
promoting innovation.

AMENDMENT NO. 13 OFFERED BY MR. BOST

to consider amendment No. 13 printed
in House Report 116–42.
Mr. BOST. Madam Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 8, after line 20, insert the following
new subsection:
(d) PUBLIC COMMENT.—The President
shall—
(1) in making the plan under subsection
(a), and updates under subsection (b), avail-
able to the public, and before submitting
such plan and updates to the appropriate
congressional committees—
(A) publish the plan or update, as applica-
ble, in the Federal Register; and
(B) provide a period of at least 90 days for
public comment; and
(2) after each such period for public com-
ment, continue to make the proposed plan or
update, as well as the comments received,
available to the public on regulations.gov (or
any successor website).
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentleman
from Illinois (Mr. BOST) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Illinois.
Mr. BOST. Madam Chair, any time
Congress considers legislation that will
radically change our economy, the
American people deserve an oppor-
tunity to be heard first. And make no
mistake, the underlying bill is a rad-
ical change to our economy, and not
for the better.
My amendment is simple. Before
Congress considers legislation to com-
ply with the Paris climate agreement,
let’s give the American people 90 days
of public comment. That is a standard
exception for legislation as big as this.
Who would dare deny our job cre-
ators, working families, farmers, coal
miners, and manufacturers the oppor-
tunity to be heard?
If you support the underlying bill,
then I would think you would need to
hear how this agreement will impact
people’s jobs and their bottom lines. No
one will escape higher prices for en-
ergy, food, housing, transportation, or
just about anything else. If you come
from an industrial State, like my home
State of Illinois, you can be especially
hard hit.
According to recent studies, the
Paris Agreement will devastate em-
ployment in steel, iron, cement, and oil
refining by killing over 1 million jobs.
Manufacturing jobs are good jobs,
and they are jobs that are multipliers,
with every new steel job leading to
seven additional jobs in the region in
which they are created.
We just worked our tail off with the
President, President Trump’s adminis-
tration, to help bring nearly 2,000 jobs
back, the steel jobs that were in Gran-
ite City that were lost. The underlying
bill would throw these jobs right back
out the window.
What about our farmers? They have
faced tougher times and more uncer-
tainty than at any other time, and this
would cripple them.
Coal miners have a proud heritage in
my district. They are barely hanging
on, and this would be the final nail in
the coffin.
All of this risk, and for what? A glob-
al climate agreement that holds Amer-
ica to a higher standard than China,
India, and other emerging nations with
bigger emissions and pollution prob-
lems?
Look, I have 11 grandchildren. I want
to leave a healthier world for them. I
want future generations to look back
and say that we cared about the future
of our planet. But we also have to
worry about the people’s security in
the present. We need to work together
to find solutions that protect jobs and
protect the planet.

AMENDMENT NO. 14 OFFERED BY MS. MENG
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 14 printed
in House Report 116–42.
Ms. MENG. Madam Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 7, after line 5, insert the following
paragraph:
(9) The Paris Agreement recognizes ‘‘the
fundamental priority of safeguarding food
security and ending hunger, and the par-
ticular vulnerabilities of food production
systems to the adverse impacts of climate
change.’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentlewoman
from New York (Ms. MENG) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York.
Ms. MENG. Madam Chair, my amend-
ment adds language that recognizes the
fundamental link between climate
change and food security, as recognized
in the Paris Agreement.
The administration’s plan to leave
the Paris Agreement is a betrayal of
America’s global leadership and threat-
ens food security for hundreds of mil-
lions of people in the United States and
around the world.
Vulnerable communities, including
children, the elderly, and low-income
individuals, are at a greater risk of
malnutrition or chronic hunger if the
effects of climate change are not miti-
gated.
According to the 2018 ‘‘National Cli-
mate Assessment,’’ climate change will
lead to reduced agricultural produc-
tivity, and food production will decline
in U.S. regions that experience in-
creased frequency and duration of
droughts, floods, and severe storms.
Climate change will cause irrep-
arable damage to New York’s agri-
culture sector, which is the dominant
ag State in the Northeast.
According to the New York Climate
Change Science Clearinghouse, climate
change may affect food production by
increased heat stress days above 90 de-
grees Fahrenheit, which could stress
livestock and some crops; increased
river flooding, which is likely to cause
soil erosion, soil loss, and crop damage;
and wetter springs, which could delay
planting for crops and reduce yields.
These are just a few examples of how
climate change may affect New York’s
agriculture sector.
However, climate change isn’t just an
American problem. It is a global prob-
lem that will cause already vulnerable
communities to face increased mal-
nutrition and chronic hunger.
According to the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization,
chronic hunger is on the rise. The num-
ber of people facing chronic food depri-
vation increased to nearly 821 million
in 2017 from around 804 million in 2016.
Food insecurity is already a chal-
lenge across the globe and is likely to
become an even greater threat as cli-
mate change impacts agriculture pro-
duction. Food insecurity can also fur-
ther strain communities that are al-
ready facing challenges, from conflict
to job scarcity.
The 2014 ‘‘Worldwide Threat Assess-
ment’’ noted that ‘‘the lack of ade-
quate food will be a destabilizing factor
in countries important to U.S. national
security.’’
The President’s plan to withdraw the
U.S. from the Paris Agreement is mis-
guided and will contribute to food inse-
curity here and abroad. It is imperative
the President understands the con-
sequences of climate change for food
security and ending hunger.
Again, my amendment simply recog-
nizes the critical and inextricable link
between climate change and food secu-
rity, as recognized in the Paris Agree-
ment.
I urge support for the amendment.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, I claim
time in opposition to this amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, I will
close once the gentlewoman yields
back.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. MENG. Madam Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, we all
agree with the premise of this amend-
ment—food security, ending hunger.
Again, this amendment does nothing to
reduce our emissions. We need to de-
bate bipartisan solutions, such as
boosting research, advancing tech-
nologies, and promoting innovation.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

AMENDMENT NO. 15 OFFERED BY MISS
GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN OF PUERTO RICO
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 15 printed
in House Report 116–42.
Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN of Puerto
Rico. Madam Chair, I have an amend-
ment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of the bill, add the following
new section:
SEC. 6. STUDY AND REPORT.
Not later than 1 year after the date of en-
actment of this Act, the Comptroller General
of the United States shall complete a study
and submit a report to the Congress on the
impact of the plan under subsection (a) on
the United States territories, including the
potential positive and negative impacts on
their economies, taking into consideration
their unique energy needs and systems and
the climate change vulnerabilities faced by
communities in these jurisdictions.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentlewoman
from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZÁLEZ-
COLÓN) and a Member opposed each will
control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Puerto Rico.
Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN of Puerto
Rico. Madam Chair, I rise today to
speak on behalf of my bipartisan
amendment, Amendment No. 15. This
bill will provide for a target of reduc-
ing greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to
28 percent below its 2005 level by 2025.
While I share some of my colleagues’
concerns about the effectiveness of
these targets and the underlying bill, I
strongly believe that it is vital that
Congress and the Federal Government
pay particular attention to the needs
of 3.5 million American citizens living
in all five U.S. territories whenever it
is considering and crafting policies
that tackle climate risk.
My amendment will help us achieve
just that. Specifically, it directs the
General Accounting Office to study and
submit a report to Congress on the im-
pact of the President’s plan on the U.S.
territories, including the potential
positive and negative implications on
our economies.
In conducting this analysis, the Gen-
eral Accounting Office will have to
consider our unique energy needs and
systems and the climate risk vulnera-
bilities faced by communities across
our islands.
U.S. territories are at the forefront
of climate risks. Given our geographic
location, we are particularly vulner-
able to extreme weather events. Hurri-
canes Irma and Maria in 2017, for exam-
ple, completely devastated Puerto Rico

We are also vulnerable to rising sea
levels and coastal erosion. In fact, it is
estimated that approximately 60 per-
cent of Puerto Rico’s beaches show
some sign of erosion, negatively im-
pacting critical infrastructure, com-
munities, properties, and the econo-
mies and livelihoods of coastal commu-
nities across our island.
Unlike our fellow Americans in the 48
contiguous States, we are not inter-
connected with a national or larger
power grid. Instead, we have isolated
systems with limited access to cost-ef-
fective fuel sources, heavily rely on
foreign petroleum imports, and face
among the highest electricity rates in
the Nation.
My amendment will allow the study
of whether the President’s plan has any
impact on addressing and tackling
these issues, in terms of providing us
important information to ensure we
are enacting the most effective policies
to help territories become more resil-
ient.
It also allows us to study whether the
President’s plan is a net positive for
territories and ensures it does not fur-
ther raise energy costs, which will be
detrimental to economic growth and
development.
We need to have a comprehensive un-
derstanding of how any climate policy
impacts the U.S. territories and incor-
porates our unique energy needs and
realities.
Madam Chair, this bipartisan amend-
ment—and I thank Congresswoman
PLASKETT and Congresswoman
RADEWAGEN, as well as Congressman
SAN NICOLAS of Guam, for being origi-
nal cosponsors of this amendment—of-
fers a sensible and simple way to
achieve this. That is the reason why I
thank all of them for sponsoring this
amendment, and I urge my colleagues
to join us in supporting this amend-
ment for the U.S. territories.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I claim
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment, even though I am not opposed to
it.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from New Jersey is
recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I yield
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the
Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT).
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Chair, I join
my colleagues today to speak out on
the President’s intent to withdraw
from the Paris climate agreement by
supporting H.R. 9 and specifically in
support of Congresswoman GONZÁLEZ-
COLÓN’s amendment that is before the
floor right now.
The President’s intent to withdraw
from the climate agreement is per-
ilous, misguided, and ignores the in-
creasingly stark reality of the impacts
of climate change in our Nation as well
as in the world.
Rising sea levels are already having
devastating impacts on hundreds of
vulnerable communities across the
country and around the world.
Last week, I visited Charleston,
South Carolina, and listened to the
mayor of Charleston discuss how they
were urgently working to heighten the
seawall in Charleston directly as a con-
sequence of drastically increasing car-
bon emissions, and likely related to
warming sea water and the rise in sea
level and volatility that has caused so
much damage.
The catastrophic effects of global
warming were manifested in 2017 and
2018 natural disasters, where the Na-
tion saw unprecedented natural disas-
ters, from the deadliest wildfires in
California to the worst hurricanes that
hit the East Coast and Puerto Rico and
the U.S. Virgin Islands.
The vulnerability of the island terri-
tories is particularly important, as
they are isolated and have specific en-
ergy issues and concerns that other
places do not due to their isolation and
being surrounded by and part of the
ocean environment.
Madam Chair, I thank Congress-
woman GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN for her work
on this amendment, which requires a
report on the impact of climate change
in the U.S. territories that pays par-
ticular attention and consideration to
their unique energy needs and systems
and the climate change vulnerabilities
faced by communities in this jurisdic-
tion.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support the amendment and passage
of H.R. 9.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentlewoman for her com-
ments, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN of Puerto
Rico. Madam Chair, I yield such time
as he may consume to the gentleman
from Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS).
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, I also
thank Congresswoman GONZÁLEZ-
COLÓN and, actually, Congresswoman
PLASKETT. I was able to visit the Vir-
gin Islands and Puerto Rico during the
last hurricane, and it was devastating.
I appreciate the hospitality shown in
difficult times.
Madam Chair, while this is a ‘‘let’s
do an evaluation of good and bad,’’
versus one of the amendments we
talked about earlier, I am pleased to
support it.
The only caveat we would say is that
we would rather have these reports
done prior to making major decisions
versus making a decision and then see-
ing how it is going to impact. But I am
pleased to support it, and I thank the
gentlewoman for bringing it forward.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I
would inquire if the gentlewoman has
any additional speakers.
Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN of Puerto
Rico. Madam Chair, how much time do
I have remaining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Puerto Rico has three-quarters of
a minute remaining.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, be-
cause I have the right to close, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN of Puerto
Rico. Madam Chair, I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, let me say, this is a
good amendment, and speaking on be-
half of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee and the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, we support its adoption.
Madam Chair, I thank Miss
GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN for working with the
committees to make changes to her
amendment. It has already been men-
tioned by my colleague, Mr. SHIMKUS,
that she was our gracious host when we
went to Puerto Rico and also to the
Virgin Islands in the aftermath of Hur-
ricane Maria, where we saw the devas-
tation of the hurricane.
Of course, part of the reason why we
as Democrats support the Paris Agree-
ment is that we are very concerned
about these severe and more severe
weather conditions that are occurring
because of climate change.
Madam Chair, this is a good amend-
ment, and I would urge my colleagues
to support it. I yield back the balance
of my time.

recognizes that adaptation of the
agreement is a key component of the
global response to climate change.
Climate change is one of the defining
issues of our time, and we are in a de-
fining moment. From shifting weather
patterns that threaten food production
to rising sea levels that increase the
risk of catastrophic flooding, the im-
pacts of climate change are global in
scope and unprecedented in scale.
Without dramatic action today,
adapting to these impacts in the future
will be far more difficult and costlier.
The Paris Agreement for the first
time brought all nations into a com-
mon cause to undertake ambitious ef-
forts to combat climate change and to
adapt to its effects. The agreement
chartered a new course in the global
climate effort.
This amendment stands for the
American leadership that was dis-
played throughout the development
and the adoption of the Paris Agree-
ment.
In order to bring every nation to the
table, it is essential that we retain our
commitment to this agreement. That
is why I urge support for this amend-
ment as well as for the underlying bill.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, I claim

Madam Chair, this amendment basi-
cally attempts to state the following:
Not only is climate change real and not
only are there profound environmental
reasons for addressing it, the Paris cli-
mate agreement was also a tremendous
achievement of U.S. foreign policy.
That is why we must keep it. The
United States must remain in it.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, again, I
agree with the premise of this amend-
ment, but it does not address reducing
emissions. We should debate bipartisan
solutions, as I stated in the past.

AMENDMENT NO. 17 OFFERED BY MR. PANETTA
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 17 printed
in House Report 116–42.
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of section 2, add the following
new paragraph:
(9) American leadership encouraged wide-
spread international participation in the
Paris Agreement.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentleman
from California (Mr. PANETTA) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Chair, I yield
myself as much time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Chair, I rise to offer an
amendment to H.R. 9, the Climate Ac-
tion Now Act.
As we know and as we have been
hearing all day, this bill that we are
considering ensures that the United
States honors our commitments de-
tailed in the Paris Agreement and lays
the groundwork for further action on
climate change.
By including this amendment in this
bill, it will then be crystal clear that it
is the United States that has led and
will continue to lead when it comes to
influencing other nations to partici-
pate in the Paris Agreement.
Now, yes, I do admit that it was the
leadership of the United States that
got other nations of the world to come
together and boldly declare our unified
commitment to dealing with the grow-
ing climate crisis. We did that by ex-
plicitly committing ourselves to play a
leadership role. We had to do that in
order to attract other countries to join
in the goal of limiting the temperature
of our globe.
That is why the United States gave
structural and directional leadership
with ready greenhouse gas reduction
targets and a vision for institutional
design principles.
Moreover, in our efforts to entice
other nations to be a part of the deal,
the United States made recommenda-
tions for financing adaption, energy in-
vestment, and support for developing
countries.
The U.S. then stepped up and led by
example by announcing its intent to
reduce carbon pollution by drastic lev-
els, an act that underscored our role as
a global leader on the issue of climate
change.
It was that American ambition, that
American action, that encouraged
other nations around the world to set
their sights and their standards higher
and to be bolder on the most pressing
issue that we face when it comes to cli-
mate change. As a result, we saw an
unprecedented display of a global com-
mitment to address that pressing issue.
That is why it is all the more dis-
appointing that this administration
announced its intention to withdraw
the United States from the Paris
Agreement, an act that would make
the United States, the country that
pushed us and others into this agree-
ment, the only country to reject this
agreement.
b 1815
If the United States abdicates its
leadership role here, it will not only
cost us influence in this agreement, it
will also invite other countries to walk
away from combating the climate cri-
sis.
As Todd Stern, the former U.S. spe-
cial envoy for climate change, stated
at a World Resources Institute con-
ference on May 30, ‘‘In the absence of
the United States, you have a phe-
nomenon of a fair number of countries
. . . trying to pull back a little bit on
some of the things that were agreed to,
some of the compromises that were
reached in Paris.’’
Madam Chair, we cannot let this hap-
pen. That is why I seek to include my
amendment to H.R. 9 to strengthen
this important bill, to stop the admin-
istration from advancing the with-
drawal of the United States from the
Paris Agreement, and to reclaim our
leadership role in combating climate
change and protecting our planet.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, I claim
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, I agree
with the premise that the world looks
to the United States as a leader. Unfor-
tunately, other countries are not lead-
ing—China and India, for instance.
This amendment, again, does not ad-
dress reducing emissions. We need to
look at leading as a nation on tech-
nology, innovation, and bipartisan so-
lutions.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

and uncertain United States Federal
leadership.
While the current administration
takes steps to actively undermine the
position of the United States on the
global stage with regard to climate
change, an unprecedented coalition of
American States, cities, and businesses
are taking action and working to lead
the United States to a low-carbon fu-
ture, as affirmed by the Paris Agree-
ment.
Cities across the country and in my
home State of California are taking on
the challenge of combating climate
change. These cities are implementing
new sustainability initiatives by tar-
geting 100 percent renewable energy,
recycling 100 percent of wastewater,
and working toward net zero carbon
emission goals.
As California continues to be an
international leader in forward-think-
ing policy and environmental steward-
ship, we are not alone.
When describing the ongoing work
and the action still needed, California
Governor Jerry Brown said, ‘‘We’re at
the base camp of Mount Everest, and
we’re looking up at the long way we
still have to go.’’ That is why, without
Federal leadership, States are left tak-
ing the lead.
The United States Climate Alliance,
a bipartisan coalition of Governors
committed to reducing greenhouse gas
emissions consistent with the goals of
the Paris Agreement, just added its
24th State this week.
I reiterate: This bipartisan coalition
of Governors is committed to taking
real, on-the-ground action to urgently
address climate change by imple-
menting policies that reduce green-
house gas emissions by at least 26 per-
cent below 2005 levels by the year 2025,
tracking and reporting progress to the
global community, and accelerating
new and existing policies to reduce car-
bon pollution and promote clean en-
ergy deployment.
Businesses, large and small, are step-
ping up across a wide range of indus-
tries. Large corporations and small
businesses alike have already taken
steps to develop and deploy high-im-
pact climate action strategies. They
see opportunities in working toward a
low-carbon future and support the aims
of the Paris Agreement.
However, for this transition to suc-
ceed, federal governments must also
lead. That is why I urge my colleagues
to support the adoption of my amend-
ment and the underlying bill. We must
remain in the Paris climate agreement
and work to meet our commitment for
future generations. The time for action
is now.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, I rise
in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, I will
close after the gentleman closes. I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois
(Mr. SCHNEIDER), my colleague.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Chair, I
rise in support of the amendment of-
fered by my colleague, Congressman
ROUDA, of which I am a cosponsor.
It was a low point of the Trump Pres-
idency when President Trump an-
nounced his plans to recklessly begin
withdrawal of the United States from
the Paris climate agreement. This was
an abandonment of our global leader-
ship.
But I took heart watching the many
cities, States, and localities step for-
ward to declare their intention to keep
the emission reduction commitments
of the Paris accord. These include 20
cities and villages in the 10th District
that have joined the Greenest Region
Compact to implement sustainability
plans to reduce the risk of global cli-
mate change and mitigate its effects.
Regardless of the lack of leadership
from the White House on addressing
climate change, our cities continue to
drive the change needed to prevent a
climate disaster.
I am glad this House is finally taking
action with H.R. 9, the Climate Action
Now Act. I fully support this amend-
ment to recognize the actions of our
cities and States that continue to up-
hold the spirit of the Paris climate
agreement.
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, bravo
for our States and bravo for our com-
munities. I think the only problem I
have with the amendment is you seem
to have to believe that the United
States has to be involved in an inter-
national agreement for us to lead. We
are the largest carbon reducer since
2015 in the world.
I think the Energy and Commerce
Committee over the last Congress has
led with bipartisan solutions that have
come to the floor. That is where we
need to get to eventually, instead of
the ‘‘he said, she said,’’ point fingers,
‘‘you are bad.’’
What can we do that gets across to
the Senate? What can we do to get it to
the President’s desk? Moving an
amendment and a bill that says, ‘‘Mr.
President, you got out of the Paris ac-
cord, now sign this bill to undo what
you just did,’’ no one believes he is
going to sign that.
We also know that even if he vetoes
that bill, we will be able to sustain it
on this side.
We look forward to doing things that
we did in the last Congress. We can ad-
dress carbon capture, sequestration,
utilization; advanced nuclear reforms;
hydropower; and clean natural gas,
which has also enhanced our national
security; and energy efficiency.
Republicans are willing to work with
my colleagues on the Energy and Com-
merce Committee on conservation,
things like energy efficiency, new
source review, and forest management.
We are willing to talk about innova-
tion, things like advanced nuclear
power, as I mentioned; carbon capture,
utilization, sequestration, pumped
storage; battery technology through
research and development; adaptation
addressing the grid, adapting to the cli-
mate change issues; resiliency of our
communities; genetically modified
crops, if we have weather conditions or
drier conditions.
There are things that we think we
can move to address this debate that
could get through the Senate and could
get to the President’s desk, but ha-
ranguing and harassing a President
who has already decided to leave the
accord and think he is going to sign a
bill is just not going to happen. That is
why I oppose this amendment.
I disagree with the basic premise of
the amendment. I agree that commu-
nities are doing great things. States
are leading. When you argue that
States are leading, that is contrary to
your argument that we have to lead. If
the States and local communities are
doing it, why does it take the Federal
Government to do that?
We don’t have to bash to work to-
gether and move a policy forward.

ance of my time.

AMENDMENT NO. 19 OFFERED BY MS. PORTER

lows:
Page 7, after line 5, insert the following:
(9) Article 10 of the Paris Agreement states
that ‘‘Parties, noting the importance of
technology for the implementation of miti-
gation and adaptation actions under this
Agreement and recognizing existing tech-

Ms. PORTER. Madam Chair, I am
honored to be here today to introduce
my amendment to the Climate Action
Now Act, which highlights the critical
role of technology in the fight against
climate change. The United States
must continue to invest in research
and development of clean energy tech-
nology in order to meet our nationally
determined contributions under the
Paris climate accord.
We need American leadership in the
fight against climate change. The U.S.
has always led in the field of research
and innovation. Our laboratories and

best in the world, and their ability to

innovate to combat the world’s chal-
lenges are without parallel.
Climate change is an urgent chal-
lenge we must address, and America’s
scientists and technologists have al-
ways risen to this challenge. Yet, in-
stead of fighting climate change, this
administration proposed slashing the
budget for climate research and renew-
able energy programs.
Let’s take a look at the President’s
proposed 2020 budget for the Depart-
ment of Energy. President Trump
would slash the Office of Energy Effi-
ciency and Renewable Energy by more
than 85 percent. This is the home at
the Department of Energy for sup-
porting every kind of renewable tech-
nology that we have developed and im-
plemented.
President Trump proposed com-
pletely zeroing out the ARPA-E budg-
et. ARPA-E was created to incentivize
researchers to develop promising re-
search into game-changing tech-
nologies that can meet our future re-
search needs. Since 2009, 136 of these
projects have attracted billions in pri-
vate follow-on funding, creating pri-
vate-public partnerships and American
jobs.
b 1830
President Trump has even proposed
cutting State Energy Programs, which
help States implement energy effi-
ciency in schools and government
buildings, saving taxpayers money.
That is why I believe that it is so im-
portant that we now recognize and sup-
port the critical role that United
States leadership in research and de-
velopment can and must play in the
fight against climate change.
These programs help our country de-
velop new and improved technologies,
foster entrepreneurship, urge small
business growth, and create clean en-
ergy jobs.
In my home, California’s 45th Con-
gressional District, there are 5,239 re-
newable energy jobs and 14,140 energy
efficiency jobs. That is a total of 21,622
clean jobs. Those programs filter down
to our laboratories, our universities,
and our entrepreneurs leading Amer-
ican innovation.
I am proud to say that some of the
great research and development hap-
pening to combat climate change is
happening in California’s 45th District
at the University of California, Irvine.
UC Irvine is a leader in clean tech-
nology innovation and research, help-
ing bring our country closer to meeting
the goals of the Paris climate accord.
UC Irvine is home to the Advanced
Power and Energy Program and the
National Fuel Cell Research Center,
which focuses on developing new fuel
cell technology.
UC Irvine engineers created the first
power-to-gas hydrogen pipeline injec-
tion project in the country. This pipe-
line takes surplus energy from the
school’s solar panels, converts water to
hydrogen and blends it with gas, which
can be stored for later use. This allows
us to use clean electricity that would
otherwise go to waste, helping reduce
pollutants in our air.
Now is the time to harvest the inno-
vative technologies we have while in-
vesting in improving clean tech-
nologies for tomorrow. I am proud to
champion and advance research and in-
novation.
We need to act now and keep the
commitments we made to our coast-
lines, our community, our country, and
the world when we signed the Paris cli-
mate accord.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support my amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, I will

back.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. PORTER. Madam Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, again, I
agree with the premise of this amend-
ment. Clean energy technologies are
important in my hometown of Austin.
We have a lot of clean energy in
Irvine, California, a lot of clean en-
ergy, a lot of collaboration between our
two States, but this is simply a finding
and does not reduce our emissions.
I again would urge, since I do not
think this will become law, that we
work on a bipartisan solution, talking
explicitly about what you are talking
about. We can pass these bills out of
the House; we can pass them out of the
Senate; and if we can do it
bipartisanly, we can get it signed into
law.

AMENDMENT NO. 20 OFFERED BY MRS. LEE OF
NEVADA
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 20 printed
in House Report 116–42.
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Chair, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 7, after line 5, insert the following
paragraph:
(9) Article 8 of the Paris Agreement states
that ‘‘Parties recognize the importance of
averting, minimizing and addressing loss and
damage associated with the adverse effects
of climate change, including extreme weath-
er events and slow onset events’’ such as
drought conditions and water scarcity.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentlewoman
from Nevada (Mrs. LEE) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Nevada.
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Chair,
my amendment would ensure that the
administration takes into account the
problems caused by water shortages
and droughts when addressing climate
change.
Climate change is no longer a threat
to the future. We are experiencing the
damaging consequences now globally
and regionally in the United States.
According to the Government Ac-
countability Office, climate change has
already cost taxpayers over $350 billion
over the last decade.
Water scarcity and drought condi-
tions as a result of climate change
have direct economic, legal, and na-
tional security implications for our so-
ciety and for our systems of govern-
ance.
In my home State of Nevada, the
water supply at Lake Mead is already
dangerously low and could face emer-
gency levels as soon as next year. As
our water supply continues to dimin-
ish, water prices will continue to rise
for families across southern Nevada,
the United States, and the world.
Under Article 8 of the Paris Agree-
ment, parties must recognize the im-
portance of addressing loss and damage
associated with the adverse effects of
climate change, including drought and
increased water scarcity. And since the
United States cannot leave the Paris
climate accord until November 4, 2020,
we are still obligated to maintain cer-
tain commitments, and that includes
recognizing the fact that rising tem-
peratures pose an imminent threat to
our water supply, especially in already
arid regions.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, I will
close once the gentlewoman yields
back.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Chair-
woman, I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, again, I
agree with the premise of this amend-
ment. Drought conditions, water scar-
city are important in, I know, the gen-
tlewoman’s home State, certainly im-
portant in my home State of Texas. It
will be—as climate change advances,
the entire continent of Africa will face
drought conditions.
But, again, this is a finding. It
doesn’t, in and of itself, reduce the
emissions, and I would again urge bi-
partisan solutions to advancing tech-
nologies and promoting innovation.

RECOGNIZING STATE TEACHERS
OF THE YEAR
(Mrs. HAYES asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
recognize the 57 State teachers of the
year from around the country who
have convened in Washington.
These educators illuminate what is
working in our education system.
Their unique and important achieve-
ments fill me with pride and inspira-
tion about what teachers can do for our
communities when we put students
first.
I welcome these outstanding teachers
to Washington this week and to Capitol
Hill this Thursday as part of a celebra-
tion of excellence.
I would like to congratulate the 2019
National Teacher of the Year, Rodney
Robinson, who is a committed advocate
for all his students and has made it his
mission to bring a voice to the voice-
less and to those who feel unseen or un-
dervalued by their communities.
Mr. Robinson has been teaching so-
cial studies for 19 years to students at
Virgie Binford Education Center inside
the Richmond Juvenile Detention Cen-
ter, teaching some of our Nation’s
most vulnerable students.
Every student deserves a high-qual-
ity, equitable education. Mr. Robinson
and all these educators work every day
to fulfill that promise to their stu-
dents.
Equity and empowerment are at the
core of Mr. Robinson’s work and should
also be at the core of our work here at
the Federal Government.
I also want to thank the Council of
Chief State School Officers, or CCSSO,
which, since 1952, has focused on excel-
lence in public education. They are the
oldest and most prestigious national
honors program for teachers, and their
work to celebrate and elevate the
voices of teachers should be com-
mended.
It is, likewise, our job as Members of
Congress to continue to elevate the
profession of teachers, elevate the
voices of students, and work together
to make sure their dreams are recog-
nized.

CONGRATULATING NATE MACK
ELEMENTARY ROBOTICS TEAM
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, al-
most 2 months ago, I spoke on this
very floor to congratulate the robotics
teams at Nate Mack Elementary and
Greenspun Junior High School for ad-
vancing to the global robotics competi-
tion.
Today, I am proud to report back
that Nate Mack Elementary robotics
team is now the 2019 VEX IQ STEM Re-
search Award World Champions.
Greenspun Junior High also put up a
tough fight and made it to the world
finals.
I have closely followed the journey of
both these robotic teams this year and
even visited them. They are big sources
of pride for Nevada’s Third District,
and we could not be more honored to
have been represented by them.
So, today, I want to congratulate
Nate Mack Elementary robotics team
and their coach, Casey Juliano, for
their well-deserved win and once again
recognize Greenspun Junior High and
their coach, Matt Christian, for mak-
ing it to the world championships.
On behalf of Nevada’s Third Congres-
sional District, congratulations. We
are proud.

WE ALL HAVE A PLACE IN
AMERICA
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, in
light of the recent terror attacks
throughout the world and in our coun-
try, many people are very, very fearful.
The Nation and the Jewish commu-
nity mourn another senseless attack
after the shooting in California during
the Passover celebration, while still
grieving those lost in the attack at the
Pittsburgh synagogue last year.
We stand with our Jewish brothers
and sisters against the face of terror.
These despicable attacks of hate have
no place in our world. We all have a
place in America. Hate, however, does
not.
The American people have the right
to pray together; they have the right
to love together; and they have the
right to worship together without fear.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JUDGE
DAMON KEITH
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to recognize a civil rights icon. Judge
Damon Keith passed away this past
week. He said one of his mentors, Su-
preme Court Justice Thurgood Mar-
shall, would say to him: When you fin-
ish Harvard law, Judge Keith, I want
you to use the law as a means of social
change.
Judge Keith said: That is what I am
trying to do in my lifetime.
The civil rights icon was courageous.
He will be sorely missed by many, but
even more in his home community of
the city of Detroit.
In one of his most famous cases, he
said, in his opinion, that: ‘‘Democ-
racies die behind closed doors.’’
And from a recent Detroit Free Press
article, in 1973, Judge Keith ordered
Detroit Edison to pay $4 million to
Black employees who were victims of
job discrimination and ordered it to
create an affirmative action program.
Some of these are just a little hint of
the incredible contribution that Judge
Keith had to our Nation. He will be
sorely missed, but, hopefully, his leg-
acy on civil rights and justice for all
will continue on in our work here in
this Chamber.

country will cross the graduation
stage, accept their diplomas, and get
ready to begin their careers. It will be
a weekend of well-deserved celebration.
Their hard work and years of study
have paid off. Yet, for too many of
these students, they will soon face the
reality of paying the high price of their
diplomas.
Too many of these students will soon
come face-to-face with a mountain of
debt that will take them years, often
decades to pay. Today, nearly 43 mil-
lion Americans, that is one in six
adults, have Federal student loan debt.
The Federal student loan portfolio has
risen to over $1.4 trillion.
Tomorrow’s graduates will face an
average of $30,000 in debt, a crippling
amount for any young person to shoul-
der before they have even entered the
workforce. That amount of debt in-
creases every single year. How can we
expect young people in this country to
choose the course of their careers, to
contribute to their communities, and
to plan and start their families while
simultaneously allowing lenders to
saddle them with loan burdens on dec-
ades-long repayment timelines?
Among borrowers of all ages with
outstanding student loan debt, the me-
dian self-reported amount owed among
those with less than a bachelor’s de-
gree was $10,000. Bachelor’s degree
holders owe a median of $25,000, and
those with a postgraduate degree owe a
median of $45,000.
I have heard stories from students at
colleges and universities throughout
California’s 45th Congressional Dis-
trict.
Merhpad and her family immigrated
to the United States in 2014. After they
settled in Orange County, earning a
college degree became her primary
goal. But without Federal financial aid
programs, such as the Pell grant, she
would not have been able to afford and
pursue an education. Her commitment
and dedication to her education in-
spired her parents to also attend Irvine
Valley College to pursue degrees.
She uses her financial aid to afford
transportation, food, healthcare, and
school supplies. Because she lives with
her parents, she doesn’t need to spend
financial aid on housing. But other stu-
dents aren’t so lucky.
Community colleges typically don’t
offer housing for their students, and
with an average rent of $1,000 to $2,000
in Orange County, it is almost impos-
sible to afford to live near our colleges’
campuses.
Jose, a student at Saddleback College
in Orange County is studying psy-
chology and playing football. He is the
eighth of 11 kids. He received a scholar-
ship to cover his tuition and meals, but
it isn’t enough to help him afford hous-
ing. Jose was homeless for two semes-
ters, sleeping in his car and at his foot-
ball teammates’ houses. Despite these
challenges, Jose has a 3.8 GPA and he
hopes to graduate from Saddleback to
go on to pursue a degree in clinical
psychology.
He explained, ‘‘I move forward to-
wards graduation, believing that if I
can overcome the adversities I have
faced in my life, anyone can.’’
His persistence and dedication are in-
spiring. But no student should ever
have to choose between getting an edu-
cation and being homeless. Unfortu-
nately, these stories are all too com-
mon. Too many students are struggling
just to keep a roof over their heads.
Recently, I met with students from
the University of California Irvine to
discuss the challenges they are facing.
One of those students was Stephanie, a
first-generation student studying pub-
lic health.
She completed the full college appli-
cation process on her own, including
applying for financial aid. She received
both a Pell grant and a Cal grant, but
she still has to work three part-time
jobs throughout the year to afford
housing and food.
She spends more than 12 hours most
days in class and at her part-time jobs,
fighting to ensure that she doesn’t
have to take on student loans, so she
can go on to pursue a masters in global
public health. Stephanie is not the
only one facing challenges affording
living expenses while in college.
Another one of those students was
Deshay, a junior at UC Irvine who will
soon become the first person in his
family to graduate from college.
Deshay left home at 17, so when he ap-
plied for financial aid a year later, he
did so on his own, declaring himself as
an independent.
His expected family contribution was
zero. While he got the funding nec-
essary to attend UC Irvine, the aid
didn’t cover all of his living needs, in-
cluding groceries. Deshay had a goal
when he started college. He wanted to
graduate loan free. He didn’t want to
take out loans to pay for his living ex-
penses and so he took on two part-time
jobs. But the reality of the cost of liv-
ing in Orange County soon set in.
After nearly 2 months of eating only
one meal a day, Deshay was left with
few choices. When he finishes college
next year, he will graduate with nearly
$30,000 of debt.
Still, he is excited to graduate and to
start giving back to our community.
He plans to move home to Sacramento
and he hopes to open a youth center
modeled after Boys & Girls Clubs
across the country. But Deshay is wor-
ried that he may not be able to suc-
cessfully apply for the loan that he will
need to start his business, in large part
because of the student loan debt he
carries.
College students who have fought to
pursue an education, who work tire-
lessly toward their dreams, are being
forced to put these dreams on hold.
Why? Because the education necessary
to achieve their dreams has left them
buried in debt.
This Congress, as we work on the re-
authorization of key legislation for
students across this country, we need
to ensure that students graduating this
weekend and in coming weeks don’t
have to choose between a job serving
their communities or financial secu-
rity or choose between putting food on
the table and attending classes.
That is why I will be introducing the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
Student Loan Integrity and Trans-
parency Act, along with Senators WAR-
REN, BROWN, and UDALL. The bill does
just what it says. It mandates that the
Department of Education and student
loan servicers share information and
cooperate with the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau’s student loan edu-
cation ombudsman. That ombudsman
is the number one Federal official
tasked with advocating for our stu-
dents who are struggling to repay
loans.
It also requires the ombudsman’s of-
fice be fully staffed at all times so the
office can conduct the level of over-
sight necessary to protect student bor-
rowers.
This is just the first step of many
needed to improve student loan over-
sight and improve college affordability.
I look forward to opportunities to work
with my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle to ensure that our students have
the opportunity to access an affordable
college education.
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I yield to
the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms.
OMAR).
Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to speak about the student debt crisis
that is holding back our students, our
families, and our economy.
Last year, American’s collective stu-
dent loan debt surpassed $1.5 trillion.
The shackles of debt keep former stu-
dents and their families from seeing
the economic prosperity promised to
them by their education.
More than 40 million Americans now
have student debt, and the amount of
debt that the average student carries is
rising. Student loan balances have
more than doubled real terms since
2005. Average real student loan debt per
capita for individuals between the ages
of 24 to 32 has risen from $5,000 in 2005
to $10,000 in 2014.
It is driving down home ownership
rates, especially for young people. One
study found that a $1,000 increase in
student loan debt causes a 1-to-2 per-
cent drop in home ownership rates for
borrowers in their late twenties and
early thirties, threatening to under-
mine the long-term financial stability
of an entire generation.
Young adults who graduate college
with a student debt now have negative
net worth with a median net worth of
$1,900, down from $9,000 in 2013.
Student loan debt does not only im-
pact young people. The number of peo-
ple over 60 with student loan debt has
quadrupled in the last four decades.
Parents are increasingly jeopardizing
their retirement to pay off loans they
took out to pay for their kids’ edu-
cation.
The source of student debt does not
affect all Americans equally. Students

of color face a higher risk of defaulting
on their student loans and struggle to
find jobs to pay off these loans due to
discrimination in hiring practices.
First generation and immigrant col-
lege students face much higher default
rates, and women own two-thirds of the
$1.4 trillion total of student debt.
The burden of this debt will be inten-
sified postgraduation by the gender
gap. It is time we started treating stu-
dent debt like the national crisis it is.
We need urgent action to address it.
That is why I support debt free and tui-
tion-free college and will be intro-
ducing a bill to cancel all student debt.
Our Debt-Free College Act would
make debt-free college a reality for
students within 5 years. We can ensure
that students graduate debt free and
are not at a competitive disadvantage
as a result of the burden of student
loan debt.
Making public 2-year and 4-year col-
leges free and accessible to all is essen-
tial in investing in an equitable future.
It would also provide an enormous mid-
dle class stimulus that would boost
economic growth, increase home pur-
chases, and fuel a new wave of small
business formation.
Student debt is not the result of bad
choices or behaviors. It is the result of
a system that tells the students to get
an education, go to college in order to
have a stable life, but then does not
provide the resources so that they can
afford that education.
But I believe together we can reform
that system.
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, we talk
about opportunity a lot in this Cham-
ber. The opportunity to thrive, the ac-
cess to get ahead in life if you worked
hard. We tell our kids every day that
opportunity is abundant. It is every-
where, in every corner. If you just
work hard, you can have access to a
tremendous amount of opportunity.
b 1900
Yet we know now that many road-
blocks exist through no fault of their
own. This is why it is so critically im-
portant to talk about the college af-
fordability issue and crisis in our coun-
try.
There are many motivations to go to
school. For many first-generation col-
lege students like me, it is to help
their families. Many want to give back
to their community, yet many are not
able to fulfill this dream because of af-
fordability.
In fact, Mr. Speaker, Michigan ranks
among States in the bottom half in col-
lege attainment. Fewer than 30 percent
of Michigan adults hold at least a bach-
elor’s degree. We are closing the door
on those who want to help others,
whether it is their family or their
broader community.
Studies show that first-generation
college students go to college in order
to help their families. Sixty-nine per-
cent of them say they want to help
their families compared to 39 percent
of students whose parents have earned
a degree. This desire also extends to
the community with 61 percent of first-
generation college students wanting to
give back to their communities com-
pared to 43 percent of their non-first-
generation peers.
Regarding college school loan debt,
students used to think about getting
good enough grades when we go to col-
lege. That is what we were focused on.
Not anymore, Mr. Speaker. Students
today are forced to make a decision be-
tween a degree and access to that op-
portunity or debt.
In 2016, 64 percent of Michigan col-
lege graduates left school with debt, an
average of over $30,000 a year, the 11th
highest in the Nation. Even after fac-
toring in grant programs, low-income
families have to pay more than 70 per-
cent of their income to cover college
costs.
I want to share a story of my friend
in college. It took him close to a dec-
ade because he was serving our coun-
try. He came back after serving not
only as a U.S. marine but also doing
civil service work for the United States
Army. He came back, and all he wanted
to do was become a schoolteacher, a
public educator. He loves it. It is his
passion.
As he sits in his classroom every sin-
gle day educating our children, he has
to also deal with the increase in debt,
with the high cost of interest, and with
all those things that now put him in a
financial crisis.
The bottom line, Mr. Speaker, is that
low- and middle-income households al-
ready face higher burdens. They are
less likely to have family assistance
and more likely to have other pres-
sures such as a part-time job or family
caretaking roles in addition to their
schoolwork.
As many low-income students avoid
applying to college altogether due to
costs, borrowers who are tens of thou-
sands of dollars in debt aren’t able to
purchase homes, start their families,
obtain employment in certain fields,
and save for retirement.
Student loan debt is further putting
low- and middle-income students and
their families into a downward spiral
that leaves many worse off than they
were when they started school.
This is not how it has to be. Student
debt has a greater impact on low-in-
come borrowers, as many of us know.
In fact, borrowers in low- and mod-
erate-income households face edu-
cation debt that has averaged 24 per-
cent of their income in 2010 alone. The
average for all households was 6 per-
cent.
Looking at that more deeply and
really unpacking that, we also have to
look at food insecurity and housing in-
security when it comes to college af-
fordability. The current state of col-
lege affordability leaves so many stu-
dents in housing insecurity as well as
food insecurity.
Most college students, Mr. Speaker,
attending at least half-time are not eli-
gible for SNAP assistance unless they
work at least 20 hours per week or they
work part-time in a work-study pro-
gram, have young children, or meet
certain other requirements. Again,
they are stuck in a spiral of insecurity.
However, working 20 hours a week has
been shown to lengthen the time it
takes to graduate, just like for one of
my best friends.
Increased college costs lead to a
heightened risk of dropping out as well.
I have seen many, many of my friends
who started with me who could not fin-
ish because they couldn’t afford it.
On-campus housing comprises any-
where from 24 to 42 percent of students’
total budgets. Meanwhile, the cost of
off-campus housing surrounding uni-
versities tends to be higher than the
standard market rate. We see that in
all our districts across the Nation.
These steep costs have consequences.
One survey alone found that 42 percent
of their undergraduate students had ex-
perienced housing insecurity within
the past year.
In many cases, housing insecurity is
coupled with food insecurity. In one
study, 59 percent of students at a 4-
year university experienced food inse-
curity. What that means is not having
enough to eat, just like my colleague
from California talked about for a spe-
cific resident in her community who
only could afford to eat once a day.
The bottom line, Mr. Speaker, is that
the more college becomes unaffordable
and out of reach for working- and mid-
dle-class families, the more we subject
students to poverty as they try to ob-
tain higher education.
As income inequality increases and
as we see it across our Nation every
single day, and college tuition and liv-
ing expenses go up as well, we are cre-
ating an environment where fewer peo-
ple have an opportunity to thrive,
fewer people can help their families,
and fewer people have the means to
help their community. This should not
happen in our country, and we should
be working day in and day out to cor-
rect this.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3400 May 1, 2019
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be here
tonight to announce that my dear
friend and colleague, Representative
EMANUEL CLEAVER, has joined me in re-
introducing a resolution in recognition
of Fair Housing Month.
Housing, Mr. Speaker, is a basic
human right, but access is too often
limited based upon race, sex, national
origin, and sexual orientation. This
resolution marks the 51st anniversary
of the congressional passage of the Fair
Housing Act, properly styled title 8 of
the Civil Rights Act of 1968.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits dis-
crimination concerning the sale, rent-
al, and financing of housing based upon
race, national origin, religion, sex, or
familial status. This year, Mr. Speaker,
also marks the 31st anniversary of the
Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988.
More than 50 years ago on the steps
of the Lincoln Memorial in Wash-
ington, D.C., Dr. Martin Luther King
delivered his famous ‘‘I Have a Dream’’
speech. It was considered, and it is still
considered, one of the greatest speech-
es in American history.
In his speech, Dr. King called for ra-
cial equality and an end to discrimina-
tion. Passionately, he argued that all
men are created equal and should be
treated equally. Although that was not
the case in America at that time, he
believed it must be the case for Amer-
ica’s future.
I must tell you, we have come a long
way, Mr. Speaker, but we still have a
great distance to go to realize the
dream of Dr. King, a world where per-
sons are judged by the content of their
character, not the color of their skin.
Dr. King was a very strong supporter of
fair housing, and he envisioned a soci-
ety free of discrimination.
I would like to speak just a moment
about access to affordable housing.
Each year, the Department of Housing
and Urban Development releases the
‘‘Annual Homelessness Assessment Re-
port.’’ This is released to Congress. It
provides the best available estimates of
homelessness and how it is impacting
the United States.
According to the 2018 report, there
were 552,830 persons experiencing
homelessness in the United States on a
single night in 2018.
The report also provides details on
the demographics of the people experi-
encing homelessness. For example, for
women and children in 2018, nearly
160,000 children and youth experienced
homelessness, representing nearly 30
percent of the total persons who are in
a state of homelessness. Over 216,000
women and girls experienced homeless-
ness, or 40 percent of the total persons
who experienced homelessness.
Racial minorities were disproportion-
ately represented among people experi-
encing homelessness in 2018. African
Americans comprised 40 percent of all
people experiencing homelessness, de-
spite making up only 13 percent of the
Nation’s general population.
Hispanic or Latino persons comprised
25 percent of the total, despite making
up but 18 percent of the Nation’s gen-
eral population.
Nearly 38,000 veterans experienced
homelessness in 2018, or 9 percent of
the total.
Furthermore, according to the Na-
tional Low Income Housing Coalition,
the U.S. has a shortage of more than
7.2 million rental homes that are af-
fordable and available to the lowest in-
come renters in our country.
After the 2008 financial crisis, it be-
came clear that we need to address the
epidemic of discrimination in lending
where communities of color are dis-
proportionately targeted. I can recall,
having been on the Financial Services
Committee, how we received testimony
from persons who indicated to us that
as a result of this downturn in 2008, the
community of color, the African Amer-
ican community in particular, lost a
generation of wealth. This is some-
thing that we are still trying to re-
cover from.
This is why we need the Fair Lending
for All Act. The Fair Lending for All
Act would create such a fair lending
testing program that would penalize
individuals who discriminate. When
they do so, and they discriminate in-
vidiously and cause harm to persons,
when they hold predatory loans and
they make these loans, they will be
held accountable because we must en-
sure we are not only understanding the
patterns of housing discrimination
more thoroughly but also understand
that we are providing clear oversight
and guidelines to combat housing dis-
crimination.
In 1968, the National Advisory Com-
mission on Civil Disorders, commonly
known and well-known as the Kerner
Commission, concluded in a
groundbreaking report that White rac-
ism led to pervasive discrimination in
employment, education, and housing.
In 2015, the Black homeownership
rate was just over 40 percent, virtually
unchanged since 1968. Over that same
period, White ownership increased 5.2
percentage points to 71.1 percent, 30
percentage points higher than the
Black homeownership rate.
As a result, President Lyndon B.
Johnson signed the Fair Housing Act
on April 11, 1968, 1 week after the assas-
sination of Dr. Martin Luther King. In
fact, there are many people who con-
tend that before the demise of Dr.
King, the Fair Housing Act would not
have been signed as quickly as it was.
Dr. King, as you know, was assas-
sinated. For many of us, it was a sad
and dark day in the history of our
country. We were saddened by what
happened to Dr. King, notwithstanding
the fact that the Fair Housing Act be-
came law as a result of his untimely
demise.
The Fair Housing Act was conceived
to battle discrimination in housing re-
lated to these housing transactions
that are supposed to allow everyone to
access housing but don’t always accom-
plish those goals.
More than 4 million Fair Housing Act
violations occur each year against peo-
ple of all protected classes, including
based on sexual orientation and gender
identity. Less than 1 percent of the vio-
lations of Fair Housing Act laws are re-
ported each year.
b 1915
In 2017, approximately 28,843 housing
discrimination complaints were filed.
Of these, 20,595 complaints, or approxi-
mately 70 percent, were filed with local
private, nonprofit, fair housing centers.
Housing bills in the 116th Congress
include H.R. 123, the FHA Additional
Credit Pilot Program Reauthorization
Act.
We introduced this on January 3,
2019. This would extend section 258 of
the National Housing Act, which estab-
lished an automated process for pro-
viding alternative credit rating infor-
mation for mortgagors and prospective
mortgagors.
I would add that, simply put, this
would give persons who pay their light
bills, their gas bills, their water bills,
all of their utility bills timely but they
don’t have thick credit files—in fact,
they have thin credit files, and some of
them have no credit at all, in addition
to these bills that they pay on a
monthly basis—an opportunity to have
these payments scored so that they,
too, might have the opportunity to
own a home.
Representative VICENTE GONZALEZ is
one of the cosponsors of this legisla-
tion.
H.R. 166, the Fair Lending for All
Act, was introduced on January 3 of
2019, and this would establish an Office
of Fair Lending Testing to test for
compliance with the Equal Credit Op-
portunity Act, ECOA, and to create
criminal penalties for invidious dis-
crimination in lending.
H.R. 149, the Housing Fairness Act,
was introduced on January 3, 2019, and
it would instruct the Secretary of
Housing and Urban Development to
conduct a nationwide testing program.
This nationwide testing program
would be utilized to detect and docu-
ment differences in the treatment of
persons seeking to rent or purchase
housing or obtain a refinance of a home
mortgage loan. It would measure pat-
terns of adverse treatment because of
race, color, religion, sex, familial sta-
tus, disability status, or national ori-
gin of renters, home buyers, or bor-
rowers. And it would measure the prev-
alence of such discriminatory practices
across the housing and mortgage lend-
ing market.
H.R. 165, Improving Access to Homes
for Heroes Act. This was introduced
January 3, 2019. It would provide Con-
gress with the information it needs, as
we work toward ending homelessness
among our veterans, by requiring HUD
to provide Congress with an annual re-
port that gives a comprehensive assess-
ment of the efforts being made to pro-
vide housing assistance to our vet-
erans, and it would also require public
housing agencies to include veterans in
their public housing planning.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3401
May 1, 2019
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be as-
sociated with all of the bills. We are
honored to act as original sponsors of
all of these pieces of legislation, but I
am much more proud of the fact that,
in this country, we are still making
progress, but we really have come a
long way.
I can remember a time when the pub-
lic housing in this country was seg-
regated, literally—tax dollars pro-
viding housing that was segregated.
I am proud to say that we have come
a long way and integrated the public
housing, housing paid for with Amer-
ican tax dollars.
I can remember a time in this coun-
try when there were neighborhoods
that persons of African ancestry were
restricted from living in. Restrictive
covenants were prevalent. And there
are still some neighborhoods that there
is a degree of difficulty acquiring ac-
cess to; but, generally speaking, re-
strictive covenants are no longer in ex-
istence to the extent that they are
commonly used to exclude persons of
color, and other persons as well, based
on religious preferences, from the
neighborhoods.
This is a country that still has a long
way to go, but this is a country that
has made some great strides.
Notwithstanding the strides, how-
ever, we must continue to do our very
best to make sure every person who
wants housing and can afford it can get
housing, which means that we have to
have affordable housing.
I was very proud this week that just
passed, in Houston, Texas, to visit an
area in my district, the Ninth Congres-
sional District of Texas, where a
project had been razed, as in evis-
cerated, and there was a raising, if you
will, of another project.
This project cost approximately $30-
plus million, and it was subsidized in
part from CDBG dollars from this Con-
gress to the tune of about $3 million.
It was a wonderful thing to see this
new growth, if you will, this new hous-
ing development in this community. It
is a wonderful project that has amen-
ities that you might expect to find in
an upscale neighborhood.
Within the center for persons to use,
the common area, there is a business
center right within that complex.
There is also a facility for meetings.
There was an exercise room. And their
plan is to have a swimming pool. Yes,
people who need affordable housing do
swim. They enjoy exercising, and they
want to have the opportunity to go on-
line and conduct business just as other
people do.
So it was a wonderful thing to see
this project have all of these various
amenities that you might find in an
upscale neighborhood.
I was there with a good many people
who were just proud to be a part of the
community and to see this develop-
ment take place within their neighbor-
hood.
As you know, we dwell in our houses,
but we live in our neighborhoods. And
in living in a neighborhood, you want
to make sure that you have got quality
housing. You want parks. You want
schools. You want the opportunity to
have your food source immediately
available to you, readily available.
This is all a part of what is being de-
veloped as a result, in part, of these
new housing projects coming online.
So it is important for us to continue
to use community development dollars
in a very positive way, so that we can
continue to develop, not just homes for
people, but neighborhoods for people to
live in as well as homes for them to
dwell in.
Houston, Texas, I am proud to say,
has a mayor who has made it his mis-
sion to be a good partner in the wise
and judicious use of these community
development dollars. That is but one
project that I can call to your atten-
tion. I have attended the ribbon cut-
ting of many other projects that are
similarly situated.
I would add, as I come to a close,
that the housing crisis that we are ex-
periencing now is one that is quite visi-
ble. In my lifetime, I don’t think I have
seen this number of people dwelling on
the bridges, dwelling along the side of
freeways, dwelling under trees.
We say that home is where the heart
is. If this is true, we have to query:
Where is the heart of the homeless?
Where is the heart of the homeless? Is
it on a bridge or under a bridge or near
a park bench at night? Is it someplace
where those of us who lead lives
adorned with luxury don’t have them
in sight?
Where are the homeless? Where is the
heart?
But the question really isn’t, where
is the heart of the homeless person.
The question is: Where is our heart?
Where is the heart of a nation that is
the richest in the world that can tol-
erate this level of homelessness that is
in plain sight?
You don’t have to look very far to
see it. Many of us take the freeways
and we avoid it, but it is right there for
all to see.
Where is our heart? Where is the
heart of the country that can put peo-
ple on the moon, the country that can
house people in space stations; where is
the heart of the country that can do all
of these magnificent things, yet have
persons who are sleeping under
bridges?
I am proud that the Honorable MAX-
INE WATERS, the chairperson of the Fi-
nancial Services Committee, has a bill
that we are taking up, a bill that would
accord some many billions of dollars
for the homelessness part of it, some
$5-plus billion, and it would attempt to
tackle this problem of homelessness in
a very positive way.
It is not just another Lilliputian ef-
fort. This is a noble effort to do what
we can to provide homes for people who
are living on the streets of life in the
richest country in the world.
So, this month I am proud to bring
this resolution to the floor, and I am
proud to tell you that we are going to
tackle these problems. We may not
solve them immediately, but we have
the will to solve them eventually.
This is our challenge. This is our
quest. And this is what we must do in
the richest country in the world.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Eternal Father, strong to save, whose
arm has bound the restless waves, we
praise You for Your magnificent love
that awakens us each day.
Thank You for lawmakers who strive
to do justly, love mercy, and walk
humbly with You. Lord, continue to
guide their feet and teach them Your
paths.
In these complex times, show your-
self strong on behalf of those who love
You. Solve the riddles that confound
us. Confuse those who seek to hinder
the unfolding of Your loving provi-
dence.
Lord, bring sanity to a world that
often seems to spin out of control.
Nothing is impossible for you, so trans-
form our dark yesterdays into bright
tomorrows.
We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.

PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE,
Washington, DC, May 1, 2019.
To the Senate:
Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3,

appoint the Honorable KEVIN CRAMER, a Sen-
ator from the State of North Dakota, to per-
form the duties of the Chair.
CHUCK GRASSLEY,

Chair as Acting President pro tempore.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY
LEADER
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-

f
NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this
week the Senate is continuing to make
progress in consideration of the Presi-
dent’s nominees. By the end of this
week, three more executive branch and
five court vacancies will have been
filled with thoroughly qualified indi-
viduals.
Already, these uncontroversial nomi-
nees have earned overwhelming bipar-
tisan support. Yesterday, more than
two-thirds of the Senate voted to con-
firm William Cooper to serve as gen-
eral counsel for the Department of En-
ergy. Mr. Cooper’s expertise and energy
policy was evident to Chairman MUR-
KOWSKI and our colleagues in com-
mittee who voted by voice to report
this nomination to the full Senate.
Now we have put a sharp lawyer on the
job at DOE.
Later in the day, we confirmed two
more well-qualified executive branch
nominees to the Pension Benefit Guar-
anty Corporation and the State De-
partment’s Bureau of Political-Mili-
tary Affairs by even wider margins.
Each received bipartisan support in
committee. So, again, I am glad to see
a similar degree of swift, reasonable
consideration here on the floor.
I might add that these are the kinds
of nominees who, a few years ago,
would have been approved on a voice
vote. Today the Senate will turn to a
slate of judicial nominees with their
own impressive trail of credentials—
things like prestigious clerkships and
strong reviews from the American Bar
Association. Most importantly, all
have demonstrated their commitment
to the rule of law.
Celebrating small wins for comity in
the personnel business is, of course,
only necessary in the wake of, lit-
erally, years of unprecedented partisan
obstruction. But I will readily express
my hope that in the coming days and
weeks, we will continue to work to-
ward clearing the Executive Calendar
backlog and confirming more well-
qualified nominees.
f
HEALTHCARE
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on
another matter, while the Senate may
be writing a new chapter of bipartisan
productivity, the same cannot be said
for the House under Democratic leader-
ship. On this side of the Capitol, we
have passed timely legislation to ad-
dress real, urgent policy priorities. S.
1, for example, helps fight back against
anti-Semitism and attends to several
other pressing matters with respect to
American foreign policy in the Middle
East.
The Senate debated the bill and
passed it by a wide bipartisan major-
ity. We sent it over to the House, and
now it is just sitting there, gathering
dust. It is gathering dust because
Democratic leadership is more inter-
ested in making flashy political points
and picking fights with the President
than in making meaningful bipartisan
progress.
House Democrats are uninterested in
our important foreign policy legisla-
tion. What has captured their energy
and attention instead? This week they
are giving prime billing to a scheme

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2534 May 1, 2019
that would snatch away the private
health insurance plans that more than
180 million Americans rely on and jeop-
ardize the Medicare coverage counted
on by tens of millions more. That is
what they are up to this week.
The House Rules Committee, and by
extension the Democratic leadership,
have officially granted a platform to
this proposal, which could best be de-
scribed as Medicare for None. That is
not just some cute phrase. It is lit-
erally what the plan would usher in—
an end to the Medicare Program as
American seniors have known it for
generations. Democrats want to take
the program that seniors have paid
into, which we ought to be shoring up
and stabilizing, and, instead, pile every
other American into it—one size fits
all. That is what it is: End Medicare as
we know it; reuse its name for a new
sort of built-from-scratch, government-
administered plan, and make sure the
resulting Washington nightmare is the
only game in town by outlawing choice
and competition from the private sec-
tor. That is what they want to do.
To the 60 million seniors on Medi-
care, most of whom like things the way
they are, Democrats say: Too bad. To
the 180 million-plus other Americans
who rely on private health coverage
from their employers, many of whom
like their own plans, our Democratic
colleagues say: Too bad. All of these
things that American families count
on, I guess my Democratic colleagues
want to wipe them all away in favor of
this untested government takeover—
completely untested.
In Congresses past, this kind of far-
left proposal would have been unlikely
to even receive a hearing. Democrats
would have taken one look at this so-
cialist steamroller and run away from
it like the plague. Jeopardize current
health coverage for nearly all Ameri-
cans—one way or another—for the sake
of leftwing ideology? Who would go for
that?
Needless to say, times seem to have
changed. Now, across the aisle, this
level of radical intrusion is the proud
rallying cry both here in Congress, and,
of course, out on the Presidential cam-
paign trail. One of the major ironies is
that Medicare is not even safely on
autopilot as things stand right now, let
alone herding every other American
into the system. As I have noted, the
Administrator of CMS herself recently
explained that ‘‘the program’s main
trust fund for hospital services can
only pay full benefits for seven more
years.’’ That is the Medicare we have
now.
Instead of a serious plan to shore up
Medicare or address costs for middle-
class families, Democrats are focused
on raising taxes massively, trading
consumer choice for Washington con-
trol, and destabilizing the current sys-
tem in the process.
Senate Republicans will stay focused
on middle-class families’ priorities. We
will leave the destructive daydreams to
our friends across the aisle.

EXECUTIVE SESSION
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the
Senate will proceed to executive ses-
sion to resume consideration of the fol-
lowing nomination, which the clerk
will report.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read the nomination J. Campbell Bark-
er, of Texas, to be United States Dis-
trict Judge for the Eastern District of
Texas.
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
TAX REFORM
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last week
we got the first estimate of economic
growth for the first quarter of 2019, and
the news was excellent. The economy
grew at a robust 3.2 percent in the first
quarter of 2019, smashing expectations.
The news is particularly notable be-
cause the first quarter of the year is
typically regarded as a weak quarter
for growth.
Then, this morning, CNBC reported
that 275,000 jobs were created in April—
also, far exceeding expectations.
And of course these are just the lat-
est pieces of good news about the econ-
omy. The economy is thriving, unem-
ployment is low, job creation is up,
personal income is up, wages are up,
business investment is up, and much
more.
How did we get here? Well, just a
couple of years ago, our economy was
struggling. Some experts were pre-
dicting that weak growth would be the
new normal and the economic progress
we have made over the past 2 years
wasn’t supposed to happen.
At the beginning of 2017, the Congres-
sional Budget Office projected growth
of 2.3 percent for 2017, 2 percent for
2018, and just 1.7 percent for 2019.
Actual growth, of course, exceeded
those numbers: 2.5 percent for 2017, 3
percent for 2018—a full percentage
point higher than the CBO’s projec-
tion—and 2019 is clearly off to a great
start.
So, again, how did we get here? Well,
after President Trump was elected and
Republicans took office, we set out to
do something about the economy. We
knew that Americans were struggling.
Recovery from the great recession was
long and slow, wages were stagnant,
and too many families were living pay-
check to paycheck. American families
needed relief, and Republicans were
committed to giving it to them. That
meant getting our economy going
again.
If the economy isn’t thriving, then,
American families aren’t thriving. You
need a strong economy to produce the
kinds of jobs, wages, and opportunities
that American workers need to flour-
ish.
So we got right to work trimming
some of the burdensome regulations
that were acting as a drag on economic
growth, and we made it clear to busi-
nesses that we were committed to cre-
ating the conditions that would allow
them to create new jobs and opportuni-
ties for American workers.
But we knew that while cutting op-
pressive regulations was important,
more needed to be done. So at the end
of 2017, we passed a historic reform of
our outdated Tax Code. We lowered tax
rates for businesses, expanded business
owners’ ability to invest in their oper-
ations and their workers, and made
American businesses more competitive
in the global economy.
Now we are seeing the results: a
thriving economy that is producing
good jobs, better wages and benefits,
and more opportunities for American
workers.
Importantly, the benefits of this eco-
nomic growth are being spread far and
wide. In March, the Wall Street Jour-
nal noted:
All sorts of people who have previously had
trouble landing a job are now finding work.
Racial minorities, those with less education
and people working in the lowest-paying jobs
are getting bigger pay raises and, in many
cases, experiencing the lowest unemploy-
ment rate ever recorded for their groups.
They are joining manufacturing workers,
women in their prime working years, Ameri-
cans with disabilities and those with crimi-
nal records, among others, in finding im-
proved job prospects after years of dis-
appointment.
That, again, is from the Wall Street
Journal.
Getting our economy going again was
a huge part of tax reform. We wanted
to make life better for American work-
ers, and we knew that a strong econ-
omy was the only way to create pros-
perity for Americans. We wanted to
make life better for American workers,
and we wanted to make sure that their
families and the employees in the
workplace all participated in a strong-
er economy. So we focused on creating
the conditions for economic growth.
But that is not all we did with tax re-
form. We also cut individual tax rates
across the board, we doubled the child
tax credit, and we nearly doubled the
standard deduction. Thanks to the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act, the average family

of four received a tax cut of more than
$2,000 in 2018.
We also made it easier for millions of
Americans to file their taxes by reduc-
ing the need to itemize. In addition to
promoting economic growth generally,
we created opportunity zones to focus
specifically on helping to revitalize dis-
tressed communities. Championed by
Senator SCOTT, the opportunities zones
provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act provide incentives for long-term
investment in low-income commu-
nities, with the goal of creating new
jobs and economic opportunity for
local residents.
We also took action to provide addi-
tional support to families by creating
an incentive for employers to offer paid
family leave to their workers.
Two-plus years ago, Republicans in
Congress and the President set out
with one goal in mind—to make life
better for American families. I am
proud that tax reform has expanded op-
portunity for Americans and made life
easier for families, and we are not stop-
ping here.
Republicans will keep working to en-
sure that the economic growth that we
are experiencing continues and that
every American has access to a secure
and a prosperous future.

NOMINATION OF RODOLFO ARMANDO RUIZ II
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President,
I rise today in support of the nomina-
tion of Rodolfo Ruiz to serve as a judge
for the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Florida.
I first met Judge Rudy Ruiz in 2012
when I appointed him to the Miami-
Dade County Court, when he was only
33 years old. He served Miami-Dade
County very well, and 3 years later I
had the opportunity to appoint him to
the circuit court bench.
Judge Ruiz has an impressive record.
He graduated from Duke University
and earned his law degree from George-
town University.
Following law school, Judge Ruiz
clerked for Federal Judge Federico
Moreno in the Southern District of
Florida and later served as assistant
county attorney for Miami-Dade Coun-
ty.
With 7 years of distinguished service
as a judge in Florida, it is no surprise
that the administration has nominated
him for this position, and the Amer-
ican Bar Association agrees. They
unanimously rated him as ‘‘well quali-
fied’’ for the robe.
Judge Rudy Ruiz has honorably
served the State of Florida, and I am
proud to support his appointment to
the Federal bench today.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

pore. The clerk will call the roll.

ATTORNEY GENERAL WILLIAM BARR
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as we
speak, Attorney General William Barr
is testifying before a hearing in front
of the Judiciary Committee.
There may not be a member of this
administration with more to answer
for than the current Attorney General,
and that is a pretty high bar. His con-
firmation occurred only a few months
ago. Yet, in a short time, Mr. Barr’s
conduct has raised damning questions
about his impartiality and about his
fitness.
Just last night we learned that Spe-
cial Counsel Mueller sent a private let-
ter more than a month ago to the At-
torney General that took issue with
Mr. Barr’s early description of the Rus-
sia investigation’s conclusions.
I ask unanimous consent to have
printed in the RECORD a letter dated
March 27, 2019, to Mr. Barr.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL’S OFFICE,
Washington, DC, March 27, 2019.
Re Report of the Special Counsel on the In-
vestigation Into Russian Interference in
the 2016 Presidential Election and Ob-
struction of Justice (March 2019).
Hon. WILLIAM P. BARR,
Attorney General of the United States, Depart-
ment of Justice, Washington, DC.
DEAR ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR: I pre-
viously sent you a letter dated March 25,
2019, that enclosed the introduction and ex-
ecutive summary for each volume of the Spe-
cial Counsel’s report marked with redactions
to remove any information that potentially
could be protected by Federal Rule of Crimi-
nal Procedure 6(e); that concerned declina-
tion decisions; or that related to a charged
case. We also had marked an additional two
sentences for review and have now confirmed
that these sentences can be released pub-
licly.
Accordingly, the enclosed documents are
in a form that can be released to the public
consistent with legal requirements and De-
partment policies. I am requesting that you
provide these materials to Congress and au-
thorize their public release at this time.
As we stated in our meeting of March 5 and
reiterated to the Department early in the
afternoon of March 24, the introductions and
executive summaries of our two-volume re-
port accurately summarize this Office’s work
and conclusions. The summary letter the De-
partment sent to Congress and released to
the public late in the afternoon of March 24
did not fully capture the context, nature,
and substance of this Office’s work and con-
clusions. We communicated that concern to
the Department on the morning of March 25.
There is now public confusion about critical
aspects of the results of our investigation.
This threatens to undermine a central pur-
pose for which the Department appointed the
Special Counsel: to assure full public con-
fidence in the outcome of the investigations.
See Department of Justice, Press Release
(May 17, 2017).
While we understand that the Department
is reviewing the full report to determine
what is appropriate for public release—a
process that our Office is working with you
to complete—that process need not delay re-
lease of the enclosed materials. Release at
this time would alleviate the misunder-
standings that have arisen and would answer
congressional and public questions about the
nature and outcome of our investigation. It
would also accord with the standard for pub-
lic release of notifications to Congress cited
in your letter. See 28 C.F.R. 609(c) (‘‘the At-
torney General may determine that public
release’’ of congressional notifications
‘‘would be in the public interest’’).
Sincerely yours,
ROBERT S. MUELLER, III,
Special Counsel.
Mr. SCHUMER. What a stunning in-
dictment of the Attorney General,
whose principal job in all of this was to
make sure—to make sure—that he
wasn’t mischaracterizing or spinning
results. This letter shows what an
awful, awful Attorney General Mr.
Barr has been so far. I will have more
to say on this later.
INFRASTRUCTURE
Mr. President, on infrastructure, yes-
terday Speaker PELOSI and I had a pro-
ductive meeting with President Trump
at the White House on the topic of in-
frastructure. We all agreed on the need
to invest substantial resources in infra-
structure. We all agreed on the need to
modernize and rebuild our roads,
bridges, highways, and also our
schools, our housing, and our power
grids, and there was a specific con-
versation about the need to invest in
expanding broadband to underserved
communities.
We told the President we needed
labor protections, we needed a green
bill, and we needed to see that minori-
ties, women, and veterans got their fair
share when contracts were let out.
It was a good discussion, but there is
more to be decided. So what we agreed
was that we would have another discus-
sion in which the administration will
present proposals for how to pay for
the bill.
Let’s face it, the reason we haven’t
gotten far in infrastructure is that the
administration has come up with no
way for pay-fors. We Democrats put in
a $1 trillion plan—not $2 trillion—but
we paid for all of it. We used tax breaks
on the wealthy and the powerful who
got huge, huge benefits recently to pay
for it. That may not be the way the
President wants to pay for it, but we
want to know how he would because
last time he came up with a bill that
had virtually no real pay-fors—public-
private partnerships, which even he
discredits.
The bottom line is simple. We will
get an infrastructure bill if the Presi-
dent will come up with pay-fors, and
then we can put ours forward—we have

already—and see if we can come to an
agreement.
Seven or eight people at the meeting
all told the President that we will not
get a bill done unless he comes up with
pay-fors. He agreed. He said: I will. He
said: I will take some heat from some
of my fellow Republicans, but I will do
it. We will be waiting. We will be wait-
ing.
At the White House, I made it explic-
itly clear that in an effort to pay for
infrastructure, the administration
must not take the Tax Code and make
it any more regressive than it already
is. I prefer to make it more progres-
sive. To tell the wealthy that they are
getting a huge tax break and then to
tell the middle-class, working people
that they are paying for the bulk of
this is totally unfair and unacceptable
to this Member.
The President said he would come up
with pay-fors, but this morning I was
disappointed. I saw both the Acting
Chief of Staff, Mr. Mulvaney, and the
Wall Street Journal editorial board
mock the effort we are trying to make
to rebuild the Nation’s infrastructure.
Their criticism? Too much spending,
the deficit is too high, and we can’t
find revenue. Funny that we didn’t
hear those same criticisms when the
Republicans in Congress were jamming
through a partisan, unpaid-for $2 tril-
lion tax cut for the wealthiest of Amer-
icans. That doesn’t have to be paid for,
but our roads and bridges do. We are
willing to pay for both, although I am
not willing to pay for any big tax cuts
on the wealthy that didn’t pass with a
single Democratic vote. I hope, for the
good of the country and for the need of
infrastructure—we know when we build
infrastructure, America grows, and
jobs are created. So we hope Mr.
Mulvaney and the Wall Street Journal
editorial board will rethink their knee-
jerk partisan reactions.
Let’s face it. Mulvaney is different.
He was with the President. He sup-
ported the tax cuts. The Wall Street
Journal editorial board believes it is
OK to increase the deficit to reduce tax
cuts on the wealthy but not OK when
you are building infrastructure. Nine-
ty-five percent of all Americans don’t
agree with that. Let’s hope Donald
Trump doesn’t follow their ministra-
tions.
The bottom line is, we hope to hear
from the White House in several weeks,
one way or the other.
Mr. President, what are your pay-
fors? We want to know, and the Amer-
ican people want to know. Right now it
is the biggest barrier to preventing us
from getting an infrastructure bill.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. President, finally, on climate
change, over the past few months, I
have been asking Leader MCCONNELL
and my Republican colleagues three
simple questions on climate: Do they
agree that climate change is real; do
they believe it is caused by humans;
and do they believe we should take sig-
nificant action? It seems that after re-
peating those questions over and over
again, we have finally gotten some re-
sults.
Yesterday the New York Times said
in an article that some Senate Repub-
licans, ‘‘in a switch,’’ are starting to
cite climate change as the reason for
some of their policy suggestions, be
they support nuclear energy or carbon
capture research. That is a first.
The fact that we have been asking
our Republican colleagues the ques-
tion: Do you believe in climate change,
and now the fact that they feel com-
pelled to say yes, even though we don’t
agree with their solutions—which we
may not—is progress. It is not enough
progress, given that the globe is at
stake, but at least it is a step forward,
and we haven’t seen any steps come
out of our Republican friends in a long
time.
Hopefully, our Republican friends are
finally coming around to realizing that
climate change is real and caused by
humans. Maybe they are looking at
poll numbers and realizing that calling
climate change a hoax looks as crazy
as it sounds. Maybe they are seeing the
changes in their own States with the
climate. Whatever the reason, it is at
least a little bit of progress—and we
will have to take whatever little bit we
can get from our normally intransigent
Republican friends on this issue—and
we welcome it.
That said, the types of policies my
Republican colleagues talk about when
they talk about climate do a disservice
to the term ‘‘low-hanging fruit.’’ Of
course, I welcome smart and sensible
solutions from anywhere in this Cham-
ber, but there is a difference between
getting serious on climate change and
just mouthing the words or coming up
with solutions that don’t really solve
the problem.
Some of my colleagues have called
for funding for more research on car-
bon capture, and that is a good idea. It
should be part of any plan, but in the
face of an existential threat of our
time, if they support carbon capture
but don’t go bigger, don’t advocate
more solutions than that, they are not
doing close to enough of what we need.
We must go bolder. We must grapple
with the central challenge—reducing
carbon emissions as quickly as pos-
sible. The good news is, we can do that
with affordable and reliable tech-
nologies that exist today.
We have waited far too long to ad-
dress the climate crisis in a serious
way. We now need to act in a way that
matches the urgency and scale of this
challenge. My Republican colleagues
on the other side of the aisle mocked
the Green New Deal, but the growing
youth movement leading the fight for
the Green New Deal understands some-
thing that I think most Americans do:
We must think big, bold, and fast, and
that we can create jobs and economic
opportunity for working families in
this transition. We welcome the glim-
mer, the little, small green sprouts of
progress, whatever we can get.
Our Republican friends are starting
to answer our pointed questions on cli-
mate change, but now the next step is,
they have to think bigger and talk to
the leader about pursuing real legisla-
tion instead of just partisan stunts.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

pore. The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk

SIDY). The Senator from Oklahoma.

NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President,
every President since 1952 has signed a
national declaration declaring a Na-
tional Day of Prayer. It is bipartisan
cooperation to recognize people who
pray and who set aside time to spend
time with God and pray for the Nation.
Quite frankly, for us as a party and as
a body and as a nation, it is a good
thing to pause.
This year, on May 2, with the theme
‘‘Love One Another,’’ we will again
have a National Day of Prayer. There
is not a requirement for Americans to
pray. There is not a requirement for
people to direct themselves to pray by
a certain method at a certain location.
It is just a call to the Nation to say
that we have great needs as a country.
As we watch the attacks on syna-
gogues in our country, as we watch
bombings of Christians in Sri Lanka,
gun battles that have erupted in
churches in the United States, mosques
that have been attacked, people of
faith being targeted simply because of
their faith, it is reasonable for us as a
nation to pause and say ‘‘How are we
doing?’’ as this year’s theme is ‘‘Love
One Another.’’
We as a nation have a long history of
prayer. Hanging in the Rotunda in this
Capitol Building is a painting called
the Embarkation of the Pilgrims. That
painting depicts the beginning of
America. It has been hanging in that
same spot in the Rotunda since 1843.
The painting is simply of a group of
people on a deck of a ship leaving out
from Europe and huddled around an
open Bible and praying. The painting
was designed and created to depict how
America began in the 1600s—people on
the deck of a ship, around an open
Bible, praying.
That is still something I would en-
courage Americans of faith to stop and
do, and it is still one of the most hum-
bling experiences that I experience
each time someone from my State of
Oklahoma catches me, as someone did
this morning, and says: Every day, my
wife and I pray for you.
It is not a terrible thing to do as a
nation—to love and pray for each other
and for the future direction of our
country.
If I can model for the Nation for just
a moment in my own way and encour-
age the Nation on our National Day of

The controversy, the division in our
Nation, the anger, the struggle. Help us
to be able to love one another. Help us
to be able to see each other as You
have created us and to respect You,
Your wisdom, and Your guidance. Fa-
ther, we admit that we do not know as
much as You, so we need Your help. We
need Your insight.
For our first responders and our mili-
tary scattered around this Nation and
around the world, we pray for Your
protection for them. We pray that You
would give them insight to help them
to represent us well.
For members of our State Depart-
ment, members in our government who
are scattered around the Earth, mem-
bers of our intelligence community and
others who serve us every day, God,
would You guide them and would You
protect them in their tasks and give
them the insight they need.
For Federal employees who serve our
Nation each day and for members of
our Nation who are finding ways to
serve each other in our communities,
would You help us this day to love one
another and to be able to set the tone
for a world that is watching us as a na-

Help us represent well, You, who You
have called us to be as individuals.

CONTRABAND CELL PHONES IN PRISON
Mr. President, on Facebook, a post-
ing was made not long ago, and it was
sent to a correctional facility in Okla-
homa, and this was the posting, simply
a question: ‘‘How do I contact the facil-
ity regarding your inmates that sex of-
fenders have a cell phone in your pris-
on and they are having contact with
children on social media?’’
An inmate who is a sex offender with
a cell phone in a prison in Oklahoma
contacting children should give a chill
to all of us. I wish that were the only
example. Just in Oklahoma last year,
7,518 cell phones that were contraband
cell phones were picked up in Okla-
homa prisons—just last year, 7,518 con-
traband cell phones.
This is within the correctional facil-
ity. This is from one of the facilities.
That table is 12 feet long, and in many
spots, the cell phones are stacked up 10
deep on this picture. These were all
taken from inside the prison. Do you
want to know what that looks like for
the whole State and how that is gath-
ered? The picture would look like this.
This is the gathering of cell phones
from my State, from correctional fa-
cilities across the State.
The challenge that we have is—for all
of us—how do we stop these cell phones
from getting inside the prison? That is
a corruption issue, and sometimes it is
a perimeter issue. It will be wrapped in
duct tape and thrown over the fence. It
will be slipped through at some point.
A guard or someone who works inside
the prison will be paid off to deliver it
and drop it in a certain spot. The result
of it is the same: contact with people
on the outside—contact that leads to
dramatic effects. It is not only contact
with people outside, like these preda-
tors who are sex offenders reaching out
to children from inside the prison, but
over and over again there are con-
sequences.
We have the consequences of individ-
uals—for instance, white-collar crimi-
nals who are continuing to run their
companies. There was the famous occa-
sion of the person known as the
Pharma Bro, who bought out pharma-
ceutical companies, drove out competi-
tion, jacked up the prices, and ended up
going to Federal prison, but even from
prison he was able to get access to a
cell phone and continue running his
pharmacy operation from inside the
prison.
There was an occasion not long ago
in Oklahoma where an individual who
was a murderer and, while he was in
the State penitentiary, used cell
phones to direct others to distribute
methamphetamine for him across all of
Northeastern Oklahoma. He was run-
ning a meth ring with his cell phone
from inside the prison.
There was a prison facility, Lee Cor-
rectional Institution, where there was
a mass riot that broke out inside the
facility. In that riot seven inmates
were killed and 17 others were injured.
This happened in South Carolina.
Afterward the South Carolina Depart-
ment of Corrections director blamed
cell phones for fueling the deadliest
prison riot they had in South Carolina.
In another case, back in an Okla-
homa prison, many of those charged
within the prison have gang ties—MS–
13, Crips, Indian Brotherhood, Uni-
versal Aryan Brotherhood, Irish Mob.
Records show that those individuals
had access to cell phones and were run-
ning their gangs outside the prison
from inside the prison. We have one in-
dividual who is serving 20 years in pris-
on for robbery and assault with a dan-
gerous weapon and drug manufacturing
and who used his cell phone to control
the methamphetamine distribution and
transactions outside the prison.
We have a RICO case in the Northern
District of Oklahoma right now, which
is racketeering, which is happening
from large numbers of cell phones in an
Aryan Brotherhood gang, a White su-
premacist group that is operating a
drug ring outside the prison and co-
ordinating their work and operation in-
side the prison.
This is not unique to Oklahoma. This
is happening in prisons all over the
country. We can go to one after an-
other after another.
The two issues that have to be ad-
dressed are stopping the flow within,
but the second, more obvious question
that I hear from people when I raise
this issue is this: Why can’t the prisons
just jam the cell phones?
That is a great question. Federal law
does not allow State prisons to jam the
cell phones.
Why don’t we change that law?
That is another great question, and it
should have been answered by this
body a long time ago. But communica-
tions companies and cell phone com-
pany lobbyists overwhelmed this body
and pushed back and said: Let’s study
the issue.
For years the cell phone lobby has
come to Members of Congress and said:
We totally agree with you that this is
a problem. Let’s study it.
I have met personally now for several
years with the leadership of the FCC,
which has jurisdiction over this, and
said ‘‘Let’s resolve this issue about
prison cell phones,’’ and every year
when I meet with FCC folks, they say
‘‘We are studying it.’’ At the same
time, meth rings and sexual predators
are operating inside our prisons. ‘‘We
are studying it.’’
I waited patiently until the last
study just came out. The summary of
the last study that just came out on
cell phones in prisons and jamming
them—the study basically came back
and said: We need more study on this
issue. That was the result of the study.
One of the prisons got permission and
a waiver to test a cell phone jammer in
their prison with what is called a
microjammer; they can put a jammer
to block the cell phone coverage in one
particular housing unit. They came
back with the results of that from one
individual State prison and said it was
successful. The cell phone companies
responded by saying: Hey, we wish you
would have included us in that study.
We should have been involved in that
study. We need to do another study on
top of your study to make sure it is all
correct. Study after study after study
is done when this is what is happening
in our prisons.
So let me just bring this up to the
cell phone industry: You do not want
your company name attached to
pedophiles in prisons who are con-
tacting children outside the prison,
waiting until they are released. You do
not want your company name attached
to a meth ring being operated inside a
prison because you wanted to study the
issue more. You do not want your com-
pany name attached to a prison riot
where they directly linked the access
to cell phones as leading up to that
riot.
Every one of the major cell phone
companies in the United States has
done lab testing of jammers in their
labs. This is not something that needs
to be studied again. They all know the
results.
What is worse, if you go back to
2005—New Zealand had already seen
this issue arising in 2005. New Zealand
worked with all of the cell phone com-
panies in their country, and guess
what. They studied it and implemented
a policy to start jamming cell phones
in their prisons in the following years.
The cell phone companies overseas
have already studied this in New Zea-
land.
Let’s take it to the UK in 2012. In
2011, all of the cell phone companies

to jam those signals, and, in 2012, the
UK passed a piece of legislation to get
this resolved.
So this has been studied in labs; it
has been studied in New Zealand; it has
been studied in the UK; and all we are
hearing is it needs to be studied more
here.
My suggestion is simple. Let’s jam
cell phones in prisons for the protec-
tion of our guards, our families, and to
block criminal activity operating from
inside our prisons. We know how to do
this. We have the technology to do
this. This body needs to address it in
law and make sure it gets resolved in
the days ahead. I look forward to pass-
ing that and not doing one more study
to delay action on it.
With that, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota.
Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak for up to
30 minutes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
NOMINATION OF STEPHEN MOORE
Ms. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent.
I think it is fair to say that most
Americans didn’t wake up this morning
thinking about the role the Federal Re-
serve plays in their lives. The people
we represent are focused on putting in
an honest day’s work, taking care of
their families, and gradually climbing
the economic ladder. The Fed is fo-
cused on making sure our economy is
giving them every opportunity to do
just that—or at least it is supposed to
be.
The Fed’s mission is to keep employ-
ment high, prices stable, and our finan-
cial system in good working order.
When it succeeds, we see the full poten-
tial of the American economy, the
greatest force for prosperity the world
has ever known. When it fails, ordinary
people can wind up losing their jobs,
their homes, and their savings.
Even though most Americans don’t
know their names or think about their
work, the seven members of the Fed-
eral Reserve Board of Governors, nomi-
nated by the President and confirmed
by Congress, have an important job to
do.
The Fed is not supposed to be a place
for politics. It is not a job for politi-
cians. It is a job for the most accom-
plished and thoughtful economists and
financial experts we have—men and
women who truly understand not just
what makes an economy work on
paper, but what makes our economy
truly work for working Americans.
Through his choice of nominees for
this position, a President demonstrates
whether he understands the impor-
tance of a functioning financial system
and respects the American people, who
rely on the Fed to keep our economy
on solid footing. Through our consider-
ation of those nominees, we here in the
Senate do the same—which brings me
to the President’s latest choice for this
position: Stephen Moore.
Let’s be clear about who Mr. Moore
is. He is not a professor of economics at
a prestigious university. He has won no
prizes for his intellectual scholarship.
In fact, he has never authored or coau-
thored a single peer-reviewed article or
journal ever.
While some have suggested it might
not be a bad thing to have a range of
experience on the Federal Reserve
Board, it is unclear what experience
Mr. Moore has that would contribute a
useful perspective. He has never run a
bank or a business of any size. In fact,
he has barely any experience in the pri-
vate sector at all. No, Stephen Moore is
a political operative and a pundit.
There is nothing wrong with that, per
se, but the fact is that President
Trump picked him not because of any-
thing he has accomplished in business
or in the study of economics but rather
because of what Mr. Moore believes—or
at least what he goes on TV and says
he believes.
As we try to decide who Mr. Moore is
and whether he is, in fact, suitable for
a job that has never before been held
by someone with his total lack of
qualifications, we might start by tak-
ing a look at the opinions he has
shared over the decades he spent doing
little else but sharing his opinions. For
example, nearly all economists agree
that empowering women to participate
fully and equally in the workforce
would result in huge gains for our
economy. In fact, earlier this decade, a
McKinsey analysis found that the in-
creased number of women entering the
workforce between 1970 and 2011 ac-
counted for roughly a quarter of the
gains in GDP achieved over that time
period.
This McKinsey study noted:
Still, the full potential of women in the
workforce has yet to be tapped. As the U.S.
struggles to sustain historic GDP growth
rates, it is critically important to bring
more women into the workforce and fully de-
ploy high-skill women to drive productivity
improvement.
That is why so many of us in Wash-
ington are focused on empowering
women to find jobs and build careers,
to balance the responsibilities of work
and family, and to participate in the
economy on equal footing with men.
Mr. Moore apparently disagrees. He
believes and has written that ‘‘the
male needs to be breadwinner of the
family.’’ When it comes to pay dis-
crimination, Mr. Moore was uncon-
cerned with the fact that, on average,
women were earning 77 cents on the
dollar compared to men. In fact, just 5
years ago, he warned that raising wom-
en’s pay ‘‘could be disruptive to family
stability.’’
Perhaps Mr. Moore should read the
McKinsey study. After all, it was pro-
duced for the Wall Street Journal,
where he is a frequent commentator
and used to serve on the editorial
board, so I am sure he could get a copy
of it. But the more Mr. Moore’s public
statements are examined, the more it
becomes clear that his views on women
and the economy might have less to do
with the economy and more to do with
women.
Here is just one example. Mr. Moore
apparently believes that efforts to ad-
dress sexual harassment and assault on
college campuses are quote ‘‘draining
all the fun out of college life.’’
He goes on to elaborate:
Colleges are places for rabble-rousing. For
men to lose their boyhood innocence. To do
stupid things. To stay out way too late
drinking. To chase skirts. (At the University
of Illinois we used to say that the best thing
about Sunday nights was sleeping alone.) It’s
all a time-tested rite of passage into adult-
hood. And the women seemed to survive just
fine. If they were so oppressed and offended
by drunken, lustful frat boys, why is it that
on Friday nights they showed up in droves in
tight skirts to the keg parties?
This is the sort of thing a college
freshman writes on his Facebook page
that comes back to haunt him in his
first round of job interviews. Mr. Moore
chose to put those words in a news-
paper column, underneath his name, at
the age of 40.
Then again, anyone familiar with his
record wouldn’t be surprised to learn
that Mr. Moore doesn’t take sexual as-
sault seriously. CNN recently un-
earthed that years earlier he had
mocked the Violence Against Women
Act as ‘‘objectionable pork’’ and re-
ferred to a program designed to pro-
mote gender quality in education as
‘‘vile.’’
So in addition to ‘‘chasing skirts’’ on
college campuses, Mr. Moore seems to
believe that women’s equality is ruin-
ing another favorite pastime—sports.
He wrote that ‘‘co-ed sports is doing ir-
reparable harm to the psyche of Amer-
ica’s little boys,’’ and he mused about
urging his young son to assault a kin-
dergartner named Kate Lynn just be-
cause she was a better soccer player.
In another bit of sports commentary,
Mr. Moore wrote:
Here’s the rule change I propose: No more
women refs, no more women announcers, no
women beer vendors, no women anything.
There is, of course, an exception to this rule.
Women are permitted to participate, if and
only if, they look like Bonnie Bernstein. The
fact that Bonnie knows nothing about bas-
ketball is entirely irrelevant.
At the time Mr. Moore wrote this,
Bonnie Bernstein was a prominent
journalist and ESPN analyst, and he
was a 42-year-old married man. But
that didn’t stop him from further un-
derscoring his creepy affections for Ms.
Bernstein, adding that she should be
required to wear a halter top on the
air. ‘‘If Bonnie were President of the
United States,’’ wrote this adult male
in a national publication about a com-
plete stranger, ‘‘she’d be a Babe-raham
Lincoln.’’ Perhaps that is why Mr.
Moore has also said that powerful men
should never meet alone with women,
because they might wind up being ac-
cused of sexual harassment. Maybe it is
a rule he should follow. Frankly, if I

were Bonnie Bernstein or any woman
who read that column, I wouldn’t want
to be alone in a room with him.
Mr. Moore has tried to explain away
some of these misogynistic comments
as jokes, so maybe he just has a pro-
foundly unfunny sense of humor. But
he didn’t sound like he was joking
when he called for the elimination of
child labor laws, adding, ‘‘I want people
starting to work at 11, 12.’’
He didn’t sound like he was joking
when he went on CNN 2 years ago and
claimed falsely that the Civil War was
not fought over slavery or when he
claimed bizarrely that liberals were to
blame for the rise of White supremacist
violence that resulted in the death of a
young woman in Charlottesville. He
didn’t sound like he was joking when
he attacked equal rights for LGBTQ
Americans, arguing that rulings in
favor of marriage equality were ‘‘over-
turning the will of the people.’’
He didn’t sound like he was joking
when he referred to the unemployment
insurance that millions of Americans
rely on to make ends meet during hard
times as ‘‘paid vacation’’ or when he
warned that guaranteeing paid sick
leave for workers was ‘‘very dan-
gerous.’’
And if he was joking when he referred
to most of the Midwest, including great
cities like Cincinnati and Cleveland, as
‘‘armpits of America,’’ well, I know my
friend Senator BROWN didn’t think that
was funny and neither did I.
Still, Mr. Moore tried to change the
subject from his long history of offen-
sive remarks, and he went on FOX
News last week and said: ‘‘I’m no
angel.’’ No kidding.
Indeed, the best possible argument in
Mr. Moore’s favor is that it is possible
to be a jerk about women, LGBTQ
Americans, low-income workers, and
anyone who has ever lived anyplace
other than New York or Chicago or
Georgetown and that you could still be
that person and be a good economist,
except, of course, that Mr. Moore isn’t
even a good economist.
For example, he opposed the farm
bill that provides the lifeblood to rural
communities that I represent in Min-
nesota, and he believes we should get
rid of safety net programs that help
those rural communities. Well, I think
most people living in rural America
would rather withstand Mr. Moore’s in-
sults than suffer the consequences of
his agenda. The truth is, we need pol-
icymakers who are committed to cre-
ating more economic opportunities in
rural communities by expanding access
to credit, investing in education and
infrastructure, and protecting the agri-
cultural safety net. I guess Mr. Moore
doesn’t care what goes on in those
parts of the country that he calls the
armpits of America.
Here is another example. Mr. Moore
has repeatedly called for a return to
the gold standard, a position described
by a Washington Post reporter as ‘‘a
lot like playing Russian roulette with
the economy.’’ Now, an economist who
believes in a return to the gold stand-
ard is like a zoologist who believes in
the existence of unicorns. It is a plain-
ly ludicrous opinion for a serious ex-
pert to hold, which is probably why Mr.
Moore has tried to deny that he has
ever said this, claiming that he has
‘‘never actually been a gold standard
guy.’’ But he has—consistently and
forcefully.
In 2009, he told a Washington Policy
Center reception: ‘‘We need to go back
to the gold standard.’’ In 2010, he told
an audience at the Fort Henry Club in
West Virginia: ‘‘We have to reestablish
some kind of gold standard.’’ In 2011, he
went on the FOX Business channel and
said: ‘‘I do think we have to peg the
dollar to gold.’’ In 2012, he was asked
on CNBC whether he wanted to go back
to the gold standard, and he answered:
‘‘Yes, I do.’’
In 2015, he told a tea party crowd:
‘‘We have got to get rid of the Federal
Reserve and move towards a gold
standard in this country.’’ In 2016, he
told a group of young conservatives:
‘‘We should go back to some sort of
gold standard.’’
Mr. Moore apparently doesn’t under-
stand that things have changed a lot
since the 1950s, not just when it comes
to the role of women but when it comes
to the ubiquity of video cameras. He is
on tape again and again giving voice to
this crazy idea that he claims he has
never supported. Indeed, his position
on the gold standard isn’t just an ex-
ample of being badly out of step.
Mr. Moore is out of step with main-
stream economics, and it is a pretty
good illustration of his difficult rela-
tionship with the facts. A few years
ago, he was banned from the opinion
pages of the Kansas City Star after he
wrote a column claiming that low-tax
States were performing better than
high-tax States. He wrote:
No-income-tax Texas gained 1 million jobs
over the last five years; California, with its
13 percent tax rate, managed to lose jobs.
Oops. Florida gained hundreds of thousands
of jobs while New York lost jobs. Oops.
It turns out that Mr. Moore got his
facts wrong—never a good thing when
you are in the economics business. In-
stead of adding a million jobs, Texas
had actually added less than half that
number. Florida hadn’t gained hun-
dreds of thousands of jobs; it had lost
nearly half a million jobs. New York
hadn’t lost jobs; it had gained 57,000
jobs. ‘‘Oops’’ is right.
The truth is Mr. Moore is wrong a
lot. He predicted that the Affordable
Care Act would kill jobs. It didn’t. He
claimed that President Trump’s tax
giveaway to corporations would pay for
itself. It didn’t. He argued that the Fed
should return to a rule tying monetary
policy to commodity prices. No such
rule ever existed. I could go on and on,
and it would take me hours to even get
to the kind of scandals that have dis-
qualified previous nominees, like the
$75,000 in unpaid taxes it was discov-
ered he owed after filing what the IRS
called a ‘‘fraudulent’’ tax return, or the
time his political committee agreed to
pay $350,000 in fines for campaign fi-
nance violations, or the time he was
held in contempt of court for failing to
pay $300,000 in alimony and child sup-
port after his divorce, or even the time
he bought his mistress a T-shirt with
the words ‘‘Doing It,’’ which is pretty
amazing coming from a guy who,
again, thinks paying women a fair
wage is, in his words, ‘‘disruptive to
family stability.’’
We would be making a mistake if we
made this story entirely about Mr.
Moore. It is certainly troubling that
President Trump was able to look past
so many red flags in selecting this man
for this important position, but it is
even more troubling to consider why he
wanted to pick someone like Mr. Moore
for this role. It is not hard to figure
out. This President wants an Attorney
General who will act as his personal
lawyer. He wants an Environmental
Protection Agency staffed with sci-
entists who will push the phony science
of his energy industry donors. He wants
a Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau where his Wall Street friends get
a free pass to rip consumers off. Now
President Trump wants a Federal Re-
serve that, instead of acting in the eco-
nomic interest of the American people,
will act in the political interest of the
President. That is the only explanation
for Mr. Moore’s nomination.
You see, Mr. Moore isn’t really an
economist at all. He is a political oper-
ative. When he is wrong—and he is
wrong a lot—it isn’t because he made a
mistake. Mr. Moore has made a career
out of being wrong on purpose.
Catherine Rampell wrote in the
Washington Post:
Moore has repeatedly, and falsely, claimed
that the country is experiencing ‘‘deflation.’’
That means prices are falling, which they
are not. But claiming this gives him cover to
argue that the Fed should pump more stim-
ulus into the economy just as Trump begins
running for reelection.
Conversely, when we were in the
depths of the financial crisis and prices
were falling, Moore claimed that we
were on the brink of Weimar-style
hyperinflation. He therefore called on
the Fed to tighten monetary policy,
which would have crippled the econ-
omy—and, just coincidentally, maimed
President Barack Obama.
If confirmed, Mr. Moore would not see his
job as fulfilling the Fed’s dual mandate of
stabilizing prices and raising employment.
He would not see his job as providing effec-
tive oversight to the financial system. He
would see his job as getting President Trump
reelected, no matter what it meant for
American workers, investors, and businesses.
That is why President Trump picked him.
Two years ago, President Trump al-
lowed his advisers to talk him into
nominating Jerome Powell, an accom-
plished financial expert with long expe-
rience in both public service and in the
private sector, as Chair of the Federal
Reserve Board. Now, Chair Powell and
I certainly don’t agree on every aspect
of monetary policy, but we do agree
that the Fed should be focused on the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2540 May 1, 2019
productivity of our economy and the
protection of American workers, not
partisan political goals. In a recent
hearing, for example, I discussed with
Chair Powell the specific challenges of
the labor market in rural areas, and he
came prepared with a serious and
thoughtful economic analysis that
showed his keen understanding of these
issues.
Chair Powell has resisted pressure
from the White House to intervene in
the economy to produce results in line
with President Trump’s political agen-
da, and that has infuriated President
Trump, who has attacked Chair Powell
on Twitter and harangued him in meet-
ings. The President feels he made a
mistake in choosing an actual, serious,
sober-minded, thoughtful public serv-
ant, and he is set on not making that
same mistake again.
Either President Trump doesn’t un-
derstand what the Fed is for or he is
hoping that we don’t. And whether it is
Mr. Moore or someone with the good
sense to keep his misogyny to himself,
we on the Senate Banking Committee
should be prepared to give special scru-
tiny to any Federal Reserve nomina-
tion that this President sends to us be-
cause, while these issues might not be
the flashiest, they are of critical im-
portance to the people whom we rep-
resent.
Indeed, when I joined the Senate
Banking Committee earlier this year,
few Minnesotans took notice, but I see
it as a chance to make an enormous
impact on people’s lives by opening up
new opportunities for people to bet on
themselves and to build the lives they
want. Our work can help to open up ac-
cess to credit for families and small
businesses and underserved commu-
nities, especially communities of color.
As a Senator from Minnesota who is
proud to represent our States’ Tribal
communities, I know how badly they
have been neglected by our financial
system, and I am determined to rectify
that injustice. As a Senator who is
proud to represent so many rural com-
munities, I am excited to use my place
on this committee to expand opportu-
nities for economic development in
parts of our State that too often go
overlooked.
Our work can make sure that our fi-
nancial system remains on solid foot-
ing, not just so that our economy can
continue to grow but so that more peo-
ple can claim their stake in it—buying
homes, starting businesses, and build-
ing wealth they can pass down to their
next generation. Our work can help to
hold Wall Street greed in check and to
make sure that people don’t get ripped
off when applying for student loans and
mortgages and so that we never again
see a repeat of the great recession that
wiped out so many jobs and pensions.
Yes, our work can help to protect the
integrity of the Federal Reserve from
people who see it as a tool for partisan
politics, as a laboratory for radical
ideas, or as a playground for extremist
ideologues who love to spout off with-
out knowing their facts—people like
Stephen Moore.
So I urge my colleagues to join me in
opposing this nomination. I also urge
us all not to let the important work of
the Federal Reserve slip out of the pub-
lic eye once this nominee is defeated.
Instead, let’s make this a moment to
highlight the important issues that the
Fed deals with every day and ensure
that it is led by men and women who
understand its mission and appreciate
the impact it has on the people that we
all serve.

RAPE KIT BACKLOG
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, from
time to time, our country has listened
with empathy and heartbreak as sur-
vivors of various forms of sexual abuse
come forward, men and women alike,
who have bravely shared their stories,
reviving a national conversation about
sexual violence and inviting others to
share their stories after years or even
decades of silence. We know that these
cases aren’t limited to any class, place,
age, gender, or circumstance. We have
heard from major public figures and
close friends alike, highlighting an
issue that has for too long hidden in
the shadows.
Some of the most disturbing allega-
tions are those that take place against
our children in school. Last month,
Senator HASSAN and I introduced the
Jenna Quinn Law, which would help
educators and caregivers identify and
prevent child sexual abuse. It literally
teaches people how to recognize the
symptoms, what children are saying,
when they are not vocalizing their
plight, by the way they act. It would
allow the use of grant funds for special-
ized training to ensure that teachers
and school personnel are prepared to
recognize and report child sexual
abuse.
This legislation is named after a
brave Texan, a child abuse survivor
herself, and has been modeled after
successful State legislation. It is an
important step in our efforts to stop
sexual abuse, and I hope we can take
these reforms, which have been adopted
now by more than half the States, and
make them nationwide.
Of course, protecting students from
sexual abuse doesn’t end after high
school, as we know. In recent years,
our country has followed high-profile
cases involving students even at our
colleges and universities. We all re-
member 2011, when the now notorious
Penn State football coach, Jerry San-
dusky, was arrested and charged with
52 counts of sexual abuse of boys. What
happened next was a combination of
support for the survivors and disgust
with those who knew about the allega-
tions but did nothing. Employees,
ranging from a graduate assistant to
the university president himself, were
aware of the allegations but remained
silent.
Then there is Larry Nassar, an em-
ployee at Michigan State University
and a former USA Gymnastics national
team doctor. He was accused of molest-
ing hundreds of young athletes under
his care, and more than 250 women
shared their testimony at his sen-
tencing last year. Despite numerous
complaints about Nassar’s behavior,
some dating back to the 1990s, univer-
sity officials kept quiet. Law enforce-
ment was never informed, and his dis-
gusting abuse was allowed to continue
unreported for years.
Sadly, these are not the only in-
stances of university officials turning
to avert their gaze from sexual mis-
conduct. It has happened at other
major universities across the country,
including one in Texas. In each of these
cases, university leaders did not take
action against the abusers despite the
fact that official title IX or external
investigations had been conducted.
Some of them said: ‘‘We just simply
didn’t read the results of the report.’’
These stories of abuse are difficult to
hear, but they have led to positive
changes by highlighting the ineffective
and sometimes nonexistent policies to
handle these types of abuse.
That is why last month, along with
my colleagues from Michigan, Senator
PETERS and STABENOW, I introduced
the Accountability of Leaders in Edu-
cation to Report Title IX Investiga-
tions Act, or ALERT Act for short. The
purpose of this legislation is to ensure
greater accountability by requiring
colleges and universities to submit an
annual certification to the Secretary of
Education, to include the following:
First, it would affirm that the uni-
versity president and the board mem-
bers have reviewed all title IX and
Clery Act sexual offense reports of an
employee involving sexual misconduct.
This would compel administrators to
take this matter more seriously and
thoroughly examine all the allegations.
Secondly, it would require that the
university certify that the president or
board members had not interfered with
or inappropriately tried to influence an
ongoing investigation.
In any educational institution, espe-
cially those that receive taxpayer
funds, administrators should be held
accountable for their actions and place
the health and well-being of their stu-
dents above all else.
The public conversation regarding
these abuses has encouraged more vic-
tims to confront their abusers and pur-
sue justice.
Throughout my career, dating back
to my time as Texas attorney general,
it has been my privilege to work with
advocates for victims’ rights and to
help provide them with the resources
they need in order to heal and recover.
But what if we could do more to pre-
vent people from becoming victims in
the first place? What if we could im-
prove accountability on college cam-
puses related to reports of sexual as-
sault perpetrated by their employees?
Well, it seems to me the answer is obvi-
ous. While there is nothing we can do
to turn back the hands of time and pre-
vent these young men and women from
being taken advantage of in the first
place, we can take action to hold uni-
versities accountable for employee sex-
ual misconduct that they already know
about and stop abusers from con-
tinuing to harm students.
I hope this bill can work its way
quickly through the regular order
through Congress, the House and the
Senate, and make its way to the Presi-
dent’s desk so we can begin to improve
accountability on college campuses all
across our country.
While we continue our work to pre-
vent sexual abuse in all its forms, there
is more we need to do to support vic-
tims. Tomorrow, the Senate Judiciary
Committee will vote on what I have no
doubt will be a major bipartisan
achievement for the 116th Congress.
We see many pieces of legislation
that divide Members of the Senate, and
sadly those are often the ones that get
the most attention. But the Debbie
Smith Act is the type of bill we should
be talking about and celebrating. The
namesake of this legislation is an in-
credibly courageous woman whom I
have had the pleasure of working with
over the years.
Debbie Smith is an ardent advocate
for eliminating the rape kit backlog
and expanding the DNA database to
provide victims with answers and peace
of mind. Sadly, her personal advocacy
was borne from experience. In 1989,
Debbie was home doing laundry when a
stranger broke into her house. He
blindfolded her, abducted her, and took
her to a wooded area behind her home,
where he robbed and repeatedly raped
her. Debbie reported the crime to the
police and went to the emergency room
for a forensic exam, but because of the
nationwide backlog, there were no im-
mediate answers. Her rape kit was not
even tested right away, as it should
have been.
Although exact numbers are difficult
to estimate, experts believe that as
many as 400,000 rape kits remain un-
tested in the United States. We really
don’t know with any precision. Each
one of them represents a story of a sex-
ual assault victim and holds the key to
identifying and apprehending a vile
criminal. Like every other victim
whose DNA evidence sat or still sits on
a shelf, Debbie simply had to wait. In
her case, it took 61⁄2 years before she fi-
nally got the answers she had been
looking for when a cold hit revealed
the identity of her rapist.
Debbie knows the fear and uncer-
tainty that comes upon victims just by
not knowing the answers to who did it
and how we make sure justice is
served. She made it her mission to
eliminate the backlog. She has become
a trusted voice for sexual assault vic-
tims all across this country and, of
course, works the Halls of Congress on
a bipartisan basis to make sure we
don’t lose sight of this important goal,
which is to eliminate the rape kit
backlog.
The Debbie Smith Act was signed
into law in 2004 and provides local and

S2542 May 1, 2019
State crime labs with resources they
need to end the backlog of unsolved
crimes. So far, more than $1 billion has
been provided to forensic labs because
of this law and has led to some pretty
incredible results.
One reason it is important that the
Federal Government assumes part of
this responsibility is because many ju-
risdictions—small police departments,
rural counties—simply don’t have the
tax base, don’t have the money, and
don’t have the expertise to be able to
solve this problem of untested rape
kits. Since 2005, thanks to Debbie
Smith, more than 860,000 DNA cases
have been processed because of the
Debbie Smith Act, accounting for 43
percent of all forensic profiles in the
FBI’s DNA database.
Though the primary goal is to reduce
the rape kit backlog and identify their
assailants, processing this DNA evi-
dence can assist investigations for non-
violent crimes as well. Similar to
criminal fingerprint databases, this
DNA evidence can help convict people
who commit other crimes.
The Debbie Smith Act of 2019 will re-
authorize this important funding that
supports testing of these rape kits so
we can eliminate the backlog and en-
sure it will not grow again in the fu-
ture. This law also authorizes impor-
tant training for law enforcement, cor-
rectional personnel, forensic nurses,
and other professionals who assist vic-
tims of sexual assault.
So I am grateful to Debbie for her
courage and the courage of countless
other survivors who have shared their
stories publicly—it can’t be easy—and
who continue to advocate for reforms
to eliminate the backlog. Two other in-
spiring survivors from Texas, Lavinia
Masters and Carol Bart, have also been
strong advocates in my State and at
the Federal level. It has been my privi-
lege to know them and work with them
on this issue.
This legislation is undoubtedly
stronger because of the input of these
and other brave survivors who are
champions for victims all across the
country. I admire these women who
have given their voice to the voiceless
and continue to fight for these reforms.
I thank Chairman GRAHAM and Rank-
ing Member FEINSTEIN of the Senate
Judiciary Committee for quickly mov-
ing this important legislation through
the committee, and I hope we will soon
be able to vote for it on the Senate
floor.
I yield the floor.

MEDICARE
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, dur-
ing the last week I was home in Wyo-
ming, traveling the State, visiting with
people, talking to constituents, listen-
ing to what they had to say. I had the
chance to attend a couple of health
fairs in Rawlins, WY, and Mountain
View, WY. The health fair is a gath-
ering of the community. It is based on
prevention and early detection of prob-
lems as ways to help lower the cost of
care. For many years, I was the med-
ical director of the Wyoming Health
Fairs bringing low-cost health screen-
ing to people of Wyoming. At the fair,
people come out. There are booths from
the heart association, diabetes associa-
tion, the American Cancer Society.
People learn information about dis-
eases, how they work, and how they af-
fect their bodies. It can aid in early de-
tection of problems. People can get
their blood drawn and visit with
healthcare providers from the commu-
nity to go over blood results. All of
this is aimed at prevention, early de-
tection, and early treatment.
It is interesting that during the same
time Democrats running for President
have been traveling the country talk-
ing about healthcare as well, and spe-
cifically Senator BERNIE SANDERS has
talked about ‘‘BernieCare’’—Medicare
for All.
To me, Medicare for All is going to
drive up costs for Americans in terms
of taxes, and it is also going to take
away the kind of choice people look for
when I talk with them at Wyoming
health fairs.
I come to you today to talk on the
floor about the real problems I see with
this so-called Medicare for All, and I
come to it as a doctor who has prac-
ticed medicine in Wyoming for 25
years, taking care of patients for dec-
ades. When I go to health fairs, more
people refer to me as Dr. BARRASSO
rather than Senator BARRASSO.
I also want to talk as the husband of
a breast cancer survivor. My wife,
Bobbi, has had three operations, chem-
otherapy twice, and is now disease-free
for 15 years, but I know how critically
important it is as a doctor as well as a
husband to make sure that people with
preexisting conditions are protected.
I also speak as the son of a 96-year-
old mother, and she is a motivating
force in our lives. She is a constant re-
minder to me that we must do every-
thing we can to care for our seniors. So
as I have been listening to the Presi-
dential candidates talk about this
Medicare for All proposal, whether it is
Senators HARRIS, WARREN, GILLIBRAND,
or BOOKER, all of them back what Sen-
ator SANDERS has been proposing. I am
just not sure most Americans under-
stand what Medicare for All means and
what it would mean for them person-
ally. Maybe some of the Presidential
candidates don’t even want people to
know what it means.
Senator SANDERS has claimed that
Medicare for All is, as he said, ‘‘a
struggle for the soul of who we are as
a nation.’’ Let’s be clear. Americans
are facing a critical choice. It is a
choice between a big, government-run
healthcare system and a system that
gives Americans access to quality, af-
fordable care that they can choose that
is right for them and their families.
That, to me, is the choice we are fac-
ing.
Medicare for All essentially means a
complete government takeover of all
healthcare in this country. Central
planners in Washington, DC, would
then be in control of the healthcare for
all of us.
Medicare for All would enroll every
American in a government-run
healthcare system. It will take away
America’s healthcare choices. Senator
HARRIS talks about, perhaps, a supple-
mental plan, but the legislation I have
read that has been introduced is crys-
tal clear—Medicare for All outlaws pri-
vate health insurance plans. The only
exception, Senator SANDERS says, is
some limited insurance for cosmetic
surgery—he says procedures like nose
jobs.
With about 180 million Americans
getting insurance through work, cur-
rently covered through their employ-
ers, people who get insurance through
work like the insurance they have. All
of them will lose their coverage under
what is proposed under the Medicare
for All legislation. All of them will be
forced onto this new government pro-
gram—every one of them. Never mind
that 71 percent of Americans covered
through their employer actually say
they like their current plan. A single-
payer Medicare for All proposal says,
basically, if you like your current
healthcare plan, you cannot keep it.
The government will take it away and
make it illegal.
Seniors are going to suffer, too, and,
actually, I think seniors may end up
suffering the most. I am talking about
people who are already on Medicare be-
cause this legislation threatens the 60
million Americans who currently get
their healthcare as part of Medicare.
They get their healthcare today
through Medicare. Medicare is already
expected to run out of money by 2026.
It was confirmed by last month’s trust-
ee report, but the Democrats’ proposal
will even outlaw Medicare Advantage,
a program that 22 million Americans
currently use for their healthcare. It is
called Medicare Advantage because
there are advantages to being on this
program in terms of preventive care
and coordinated care. There is a reason
people sign up for Medicare Advantage.
All 22 million would lose that as well
under the Democrats’ Medicare for All
plan.
Healthcare programs benefiting mili-
tary families and children will also be
eliminated. Democrats plan to abolish
servicemembers’ TRICARE and the
Children’s Health Insurance Plan. All
of that goes away under what the
Democrats’ radical proposal is talking
about.
Perhaps the greatest deception of
Medicare for All is the suggestion that
government-run care would be free. Let
me say to the American people: Do not

be deceived. Do not be deceived. Ameri-
cans will pay a very high price. Medi-
care for All has been estimated at a 10-
year pricetag of $32 trillion. There is
only one way to even try to pay for
this massive plan and that is to dra-
matically raise everyone’s income
taxes to the point where they may need
to pay double. That is what is being
proposed.
So the result will be less freedom,
lower quality of care, and longer lines
as people have to wait to get to a doc-
tor, because Washington will be con-
trolling the doctor-patient medical de-
cisions—and, mark my words, Wash-
ington will ration care. Rationing
means delays and delay means denial
of care. Government-run healthcare is
notorious for producing long lines, long
waiting periods, delay in care—even ur-
gently needed care.
The government-run system has
failed where they tried to put it in
place in Vermont, in Senator SANDERS’
home State. They started it and ended
up having to eliminate it. They
couldn’t afford it. It wasn’t working. It
was too complicated. That is in one
State.
We also have the situation of what is
going on both in England and Canada
right now in terms of costs and limits
of care, the denial of treatment, the
delay in treatment.
I think people watching may have
seen the stories as a result of what is
happening in England, where elderly
patients are going blind in Britain
right now. Why would they be going
blind? Because the government is ra-
tioning cataract surgery. People can
Google ‘‘going blind in Britain.’’ It is
the British healthcare system that is
causing it because of the rationing of
care. So Democrats are promoting this
Medicare for All. Basically they are
saying that ObamaCare needs to be re-
pealed and replaced because it has
failed the American people. The solu-
tion they are offering is not one that I
think would make things better, but it
is one that I think would make things
worse.
Republicans, at the same time, are
working for meaningful, workable solu-
tions that lower the costs of prescrip-
tion drugs, solutions that increase
healthcare choice and transparency,
and solutions that expand all Ameri-
cans’ access to affordable care. We
want to make sure patients can get the
care they need from the doctor they
choose at a lower cost.
So instead of proposing higher taxes,
which is what the Democrats are pro-
posing, instead of proposing healthcare
rationing, which will come with Medi-
care for All, Democrats need to begin
working with Republicans to improve
healthcare for all Americans, and they
should start by rejecting BernieCare.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Ohio.
TRIBUTE TO MARK POWDEN
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise
today to honor the career of my long-
time chief of staff, staff director of the
Democratic staff on the Senate Bank-
ing Committee, former staff director
for Republicans on the HELP Com-
mittee, and my good friend Mark
Powden.
Mark is the model of a public servant
and of a Senate staffer. He spent dec-
ades serving in these Halls, first for
Senator Jeffords, and then, in 2007, he
joined my office, becoming my chief of
staff less than 2 years later.
I was a brandnew Senator. I still had
a lot to learn. There were few better
teachers in this institution and this
city than Mark Powden. He helped
steer our office in its early days, set-
ting up a well-oiled machine, I would
like to think, that would serve Ohioans
at home and advocate for them in
Washington. Under Mark’s leadership,
we delivered results for the 12 million
people in Ohio.
When the country wanted to write off
the American auto industry, we said
no. We weren’t going to abandon this
industry and millions of American
workers—literally hundreds of thou-
sands in Ohio. Mark was passionate
about making sure we got the best deal
possible for Ohio workers. It wasn’t
just auto workers.
Mark took over the job as chief of
staff in my office during the depths of
the recession around the time Presi-
dent Obama took office, after the econ-
omy was tanking with a loss of 800,000
jobs a month at the end of the Bush ad-
ministration. Ohio had lost 423,000 jobs
over a 2-year period—nearly 8 percent
of the jobs in the State. Under Mark’s
leadership, we worked to create the
Hardest Hit Fund, which targeted re-
sources to communities in places like
Ohio that had been devastated by the
financial crisis. Mark and so many oth-
ers have heard me say that the ZIP
Code where my wife Connie and I live
in Cleveland, OH—ZIP Code 44105—at
that point, in the first half of 2007,
there were more foreclosures in that
ZIP Code than in any other ZIP Code in
the United States of America.
Mark always made sure that invest-
ing in Ohio was a priority. We helped
secure $100 million to expand cancer re-
search and treatment at the Ohio State
University Wexner Medical Center and
James Cancer Hospital.
Through all of these accomplish-
ments, Mark remained true to his
Vermont roots. It is where he grew up.
His first major job in Washington was
with a Republican in those days, a Sen-
ator from Vermont. He tried his hard-
est always to bring Vermont’s bucolic
vales to the Nation’s Capital, and he
maintained the utmost respect for the
institution of the Senate.
He had an incredible wealth of
knowledge on the history of this place
and on legislative procedure and tradi-
tion, and he passed it on to other staff-
ers—from my new chief of staff, when
Mark moved over to lead the Senate
Banking Committee, to the LCs new to
the Senate, hoping to learn. We will
miss all that about Mark Powden.
I will miss Mark’s counsel. I will
miss his hard work. I will miss his
sense of humor. I will miss his mod-
esty. I will particularly miss his farmer
jokes that he tells so well after grow-
ing up in rural Vermont. It is not sur-
prising that Mark would not want to be
here today as I honor him because he
just doesn’t want to show up to be hon-
ored. But after decades in public serv-
ice, he has earned a long retirement
with his wife Wendy; his two sons, Jo-
seph and Russell; and his entire family.
Mark, thank you for what you did for
me, thank you for what you did for our
State, and thank you for what you do
for our country.
I would add to this that one of the
people Mark helped to teach is with me
on the floor today. She is about to join
a Presidential campaign. Her name is
Hannah Fine. I want to recognize her
service. This is the first time, I believe,
she has been on the Senate floor for a
moment like this. So, Hannah, thank
you.
NOMINATION OF STEPHEN MOORE
Mr. President, this weekend, the
President’s pick for the Federal Re-
serve, Stephen Moore, said that we
should focus a little less on all of his
offensive and outlandish articles, the
comments he made about women in
print and on the air, the comments he
made about places like Cincinnati and
Cleveland, the attacks he has made on
middle America, on working families.
He said: Forget about all that. Let’s
talk about my economic record.
Well, Mr. Moore should be careful
what he wishes for. His economic
record is dangerous. It is out of touch.
It is a big part of the reason we have
suffered so many of the economic prob-
lems we have had in the last decade.
Even conservative economists have
criticized him.
He has claimed over and over again
that the country is experiencing defla-
tion. In other words, he thinks prices
are falling. I don’t know where he gets
these ideas. I don’t have any constitu-
ents who complain to me about prices
falling—about deflation—but Mr.
Moore seems to see things that aren’t
really there.
Tell someone who is paying college
tuition, whether it is at Sinclair Com-
munity College or whether it is at Ohio
State or Kent State University, that
the prices are going down. Tell it to
someone with diabetes trying to afford
insulin. Tell somebody in Columbus,
OH, who is trying to pay the rent that
prices are falling. It is absurd. He
makes economic statements like that
with so little basis in fact.
He has been a conspiracy theorist. He
thinks government statistics on the
economy can’t be trusted. Maybe that
is where he got the idea that the cost
of living is going down. He wants to re-
turn to the gold standard. He said on
CNBC this morning that instead of
talking about equal pay for women, the
problem actually has been the steady
decline in male earnings. I don’t dis-
agree the problem has been stagnant

wages for men, but I also can’t believe
he would say the problem is not wom-
en’s wages when we know that—I have
spent a lot of time on this floor talking
about the dignity of work. I understand
that so many Americans have seen cor-
porate profits go up; we have seen exec-
utive compensation explode upward; we
have seen workers working harder and
being more productive; and we have
seen wages remain flat. The issue is
that wages are flat, in large part, be-
cause this body and this President have
followed the advice of Stephen Moore
and continued to cut taxes on rich peo-
ple, underinvest in infrastructure,
underinvest in working families,
underinvest in public health, and
underinvest in public education. So to
put it on women and say that the prob-
lem has actually been the steady de-
cline in male earnings—we shouldn’t
even be talking about women’s wages—
just makes no sense.
He doesn’t seem to understand that,
fundamentally, as challenged as so
many working families are with stag-
nant wages and with lack of oppor-
tunity, if you are a woman in this
country, if you are someone of color,
the challenges are even greater. He
should know that. Every economic sta-
tistic shows that. Sentient human
beings walking down the street and lis-
tening should know that. But for some
reason, this man who wants to be a
Governor on the Federal Reserve
thinks otherwise.
He wants the entire country—and
this is probably even more serious. He
wants the entire country to look like
Kansas. He was the mastermind—or
one of the masterminds—behind Gov-
ernor Brownback’s move in Kansas to
basically eliminate tax liability for a
whole group of mostly prosperous peo-
ple, to cut taxes overall on the rich,
and then go after public education and
cut public education. It was so extreme
that once it was enacted in a very Re-
publican State by a Republican Gov-
ernor, it was the Republicans in the
legislature who unenacted it. They re-
pealed most of the things he did and
overrode this far-right Republican Gov-
ernor’s veto, again, based on what Mr.
Moore had suggested. While almost all
of the 50 States were gaining jobs,
once-prosperous Kansas lost jobs dur-
ing this time. He wants that disastrous
economic model to go nationwide, and
we know he is not alone. It is the same
philosophy that so many in this town
say we should do—tax cuts for the rich
and not for working families. It is this
view that if you cut taxes on the rich,
the money will trickle down and every-
body will have a better standard of liv-
ing. We tried that with President
Reagan, and it didn’t work. We tried
that with President Bush, and it didn’t
work. If you remember in the 8 years of
the Bush economy, a few hundred thou-
sand in a country of 300-plus million,
there was no net job growth to speak of
in the Bush 8 years. Then the Trump
tax bill cut taxes on the rich, and
maybe it will trickle down, and we will
have more jobs and more wages and all
that. It just never works. It works for
the rich. They get huge tax cuts. Bill
Clinton, on the other hand—during his
8 years, in which they increased taxes
on upper income people, we saw a 20
million net job increase.
For some reason, Stephen Moore and
his corporate crowd don’t understand
what happens when you cut taxes for
the rich. You don’t grow the economy
by giving more money to the super-
wealthy, who will invest it in Swiss
bank accounts. You focus on the mid-
dle class, and you give the tax breaks
to the middle class like our earned-in-
come tax credit bill. If you focus tax
breaks on the middle class, you will
grow the economy because you are put-
ting money in the pocket of somebody
making $20- or $30- or $50- or $100,000 a
year. They are going to spend it. They
are not going to put it in a Swiss bank
account. When you give tax cuts to
some of the people in the Trump Cabi-
net, they are going to put more in
Swiss bank accounts. They are not
going to spend it. They are not going
to invest it. They are not going to
make any difference in our economy.
So I ask my colleagues to vote no on
Stephen Moore not only because there
is so much about him and what he has
done and what he has written, but
mostly for what he would advocate as a
member of the Federal Reserve.
If you love your country, you will
fight for the people who make it work,
and you respect and honor work. There
is nothing about Mr. Moore’s record
that would suggest he would do that.
We need someone on the Federal Re-
serve who actually understands that.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I
would like to first give approximately
a 1-minute speech and then speak for a
longer time on another subject.
I am happy to recognize small busi-
nesses in Iowa, and, of course, we
should recognize them all across our
country. We do that by celebrating Na-
tional Small Business Week.
In my State of Iowa, 99 percent of all
businesses are small businesses. Also,
almost half of Iowa’s employees are
employed by small businesses.
Government regulations have a dis-
proportionate impact on small busi-
nesses, often costing them 20 percent
more than the average of all busi-
nesses. So we need to remember that
small businesses are the main source of
America’s innovations and economic
strength. We should all be proud of and
support these men and women who
work hard to keep our communities vi-
brant.
This week is devoted to honoring
small business.

tax filing season came to an end. This
filing season was a very important
milestone as it was the first tax filing
season under the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act signed by the President before
Christmas 2017.
Congressional Democrats sought to
turn the filing season into an indict-
ment of the tax reform through a cam-
paign of misinformation and a cam-
paign of half-truths. They were ob-
sessed with finding anything—just any-
thing—they could hang their hat on to
declare that the tax filing system was
a failure.
I will give you a case in point—
maybe, several cases.
They attempted to use early and in-
complete tax reform data to mislead
taxpayers into believing that since the
average tax refunds went down, tax-
payers’ taxes actually went up. Of
course, such a claim is just simple hog-
wash. The size of the tax refund tells
you absolutely nothing about a tax-
payer’s overall tax liability. The tax
refund, as most people ought to know,
tells you how much a taxpayer over-
paid the Federal Government through-
out the year.
None other than the Washington Post
Fact Checker called out Democrat tax
refund falsehoods as, in their words,
‘‘nonsensical and misleading.’’ The
Democrat talking points earned the
Democrats a whopping four Pinocchios
from that Fact Checker. Yet the Demo-
crats wouldn’t let facts or reason get in
their way, because if it did, it wouldn’t
be a political win for them. The Demo-
crats continued to mislead and scare
the public for several more weeks. And
why not? The truth might hurt.
Then, more complete tax refund data
came in showing that the average tax
refunds were actually in line with the
previous years. Much to the Demo-
crats’ chagrin, their favorite talking
point was, once and for all, exposed for
the nonsense that it is.
The fact is that this filing season was
a resounding success for the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act, signed before Christmas
2017. The filing season happened to run
remarkably smoothly. This became
even clearer the further into the filing
season we went and a more complete
picture emerged. On four points, all the
IRS computer systems functioned as
planned, refunds were processed in a
timely manner, the total number of re-
funds sent to taxpayers are up—and the
average refund amount differed by only
$55 compared to the previous tax year—
and, lastly and most importantly, mil-
lions of middle-income taxpayers saw
less of their hard-earned money go to
Washington. And, of course, that was
the purpose of the tax bill in the first
place.
Now, unfortunately, the Democrats
remain yet today as determined as ever

to take down tax reform through a
campaign of misinformation. For
years, they misled the American people
and promoted a narrative full of distor-
tions and misrepresentations about
what the law does and doesn’t do. Even
when the bill was a little more than a
1-page outline, Democrats began their
campaign depicting tax reform as a
giveaway to the wealthy and a tax hike
for the middle class. As the committee
discussed new ideas and as the com-
mittee drafted a final bill, it actually
evolved. It was never like somebody 6
months before said: This is what we are
going to pass, and we are going to pass
it just this way.
No, it evolved considerably from the
initial framework.
Yet the Democrat talking points that
began when we first started talking
about the bill never changed and, still
today, haven’t changed. Analysis after
analysis, ranging from the nonpartisan
Joint Committee on Taxation to even
the very liberal Tax Policy Center,
showed that tax reform would cut
taxes on average for every income
group. These analyses showed that to
the extent there were tax increases,
they were largely concentrated on the
wealthy—in other words, a more ag-
gressive tax law.
That is right. The taxpayers Demo-
crats claimed were the big winners in
the tax reform are actually the ones
most likely to see a tax hike. More-
over, according to the Joint Committee
on Taxation analysis, the largest per-
centage of tax cuts are concentrated
among low- and middle-income groups.
For emphasis, the Joint Committee on
Taxation analysis also shows that tax
reform made the Tax Code more pro-
gressive. I have said it twice now. I say
it a lot of times. I am trying to get
somebody to understand that this is
what experts say, not what this Sen-
ator says.
Millionaires now shoulder an even
larger share of the total tax burden
than under prior law. As you can ex-
pect, Democrats are determined not to
let these facts get in their political
way. Since the beginning, they have ar-
gued that up was down and that tax
cuts were tax increases, and have even
suggested the bill’s passage was a sign
of ‘‘Armageddon.’’
Unfortunately, their constant drum
beat, coupled with little pushback from
the mainstream media, has worked to
mislead too many taxpayers. However,
there are signs that some in the media
are starting to see that the Democrats’
talking points are the nonsense that
those talking points really are. You
might not believe this, but a few weeks
ago the New York Times, of all papers,
published an article highlighting how
Democratic talking points and far too
many Americans’ perceptions of the
law don’t match reality.
I would like to ask you to study this
chart. It compares the liberal Tax Pol-
icy Center’s analysis of taxpayers re-
ceiving tax cuts under the individual
income provisions of the law with a re-
cent survey of taxpayers who think
they received a tax cut.
Follow me on this chart. As you can
see, there is a large gap between how
many taxpayers actually received a tax
cut and those who think they did.
Based on the Tax Policy Center anal-
ysis, nearly 70 percent of Americans
earning between $30,000 and $50,000 saw
a tax cut, but only about 36 percent
think they got the tax cut. Similarly,
more than 80 percent of Americans
earning $50,000 and $70,000 received a
tax cut, but only half that amount, 40
percent, think they got a tax cut. The
gap between perception and reality
continues as you go up the income
scale. Only about half as many people
who did actually get a tax cut think
they did. As noted in the New York
Times:
To a large degree, the gap between percep-
tion and reality on the tax cuts appears to
flow from a sustained—and misleading—ef-
fort by liberal opponents of the law to brand
it as a broad middle-class tax increase.
Now, read ‘‘liberal opponents’’ as
people in the leadership of the Demo-
cratic Party, both in Congress and out-
side of Congress, misleading the people.
You can see from these statistics on
the chart that they were enormously
successful and they probably knew
what the information was, but for some
people, when it comes to politics, the
truth doesn’t matter.
Something I don’t get a chance to do
very often is to applaud the New York
Times for finally calling Democrats
out for their efforts to mislead the
American public, but even in this New
York Times article, the paper was se-
lective in its reporting. The paper
chose to highlight only the Tax Policy
Center’s analysis of the individual in-
come tax provisions rather than its
analysis of all major tax provisions en-
acted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Even the liberal Tax Policy Center rec-
ognizes the person who has the legal
burden of paying a tax isn’t necessarily
the one who bears the economic inci-
dence of that tax. For instance, it is
widely recognized that a portion of the
corporate tax ultimately falls on indi-
viduals in the form of reduced wages,
so we cut the corporate tax rate. There
ought to be a positive benefit from that
for the workers.
Thus, when all major provisions of
tax reform are considered, the percent-
age of taxpayers receiving a tax cut is
not 70 percent, as reported, but 80 per-
cent. Moreover, when you look at tax-
payers with incomes between $50,000
and $70,000, the percentage receiving a
tax cut climbs to 90 percent.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD the
complete Tax Policy Center analysis of
Americans who receive tax cuts under
tax reform.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I
hope that the New York Times article
will be a wake-up call to congressional
Democrats and people outside of Con-
gress to abandon this misleading rhet-
oric. Unfortunately, it is more likely
they will continue their campaign of
misinformation. Yet, as more and more
hard data come in on the benefits of
tax reform, it will become harder and
harder for the American public to take
the Democrats seriously with their
rhetoric.
With the tax filing season now behind
us, we are finally starting to get some
of this hard data. H&R Block has re-
leased data for this filing season based
upon its experience in helping tax-
payers during this filing season, which
demonstrate how taxpayers fared in
each State. Again, as you can see from
this chart, taxpayers who are in red
and blue States alike have all benefited
from tax reform.
One knows what the rhetoric was
around here even before we voted on
this bill: It is an attack on the blue
States. Well, it didn’t turn out that
way. On average for all States, tax-
payers saw a 24-percent reduction in
their tax bills.
This data directly contradict mis-
leading arguments by these Wash-
ington Democrats, as I stated, that tax
reform was an attack on high-tax blue
States due to the cap on the State and
local tax deductions, and we set that
cap at $10,000.
According to H&R Block, not accord-
ing to this Senator, some of the largest
tax reductions are actually found in
the high-tax blue States. On average,
taxpayers in New Jersey saw the larg-
est reduction in their tax bills at 29
percent. New Jersey, based on the last
several elections, is a blue State. Mas-
sachusetts had the second largest re-
duction of 27.6 percent, and California
had the third largest with 27.1 percent.
They are blue States.
The fact is, on average, taxpayers in
every State have benefited from tax re-
form, and in some cases, high-tax blue
States have fared even better than red
States.
I am proud of the work we did on tax
reform. No bill is perfect, and we still
have work to do in addressing a num-
ber of technical correction issues, but
we have kept our promise to enact
meaningful reform that has cut taxes
for the middle class.
Even more important is what tax re-
form means for long-term economic
growth. It doesn’t take a tax expert to
see that income, wages, jobs, and un-
employment numbers have all very
much improved since the enactment of
this tax bill. That then reflects in sig-
nificant benefits obtained by American
workers. Of course, that is on top of
the direct tax relief that hard-working
individuals and families are already re-
ceiving, which I described at the begin-
ning of my remarks.
Annualized growth in real after-tax
personal income averaged 21⁄2 percent
during the Obama administration; it
has averaged 3.3 percent since tax re-
form.
Annualized growth in real average
hourly earnings averaged a mere 0.6
percent under Obama compared to 1.7
percent following the enactment of the
tax bill. So it is about three times as
much.
Monthly job gains averaged 110,000
under President Obama; they averaged
215,000 after this tax bill passed.
There have been nearly 5.4 million
jobs created since January of 2017, with
more than half of that job creation
having occurred since the enactment of
tax reform.
Under President Obama, the unem-
ployment rate averaged a whopping 7.4
percent. Today, it averages 3.9 percent.
Following tax reform and for the
first time since 2001, the number of job
openings in the national economy has
exceeded the number of unemployed
Americans—a phenomenon that has
continued for the past year. That
means an American who wants a job
can get a job.
To say it simply, tax reform is work-
ing for America. For the Democrats to
suggest otherwise is nothing more than
their continued effort to mislead the
American public. I invite the Demo-
crats to take a page from the New
York Times article, acknowledge the
facts, and work with us to continue to
improve the economic environment for
hard-working individuals and families
all across this great country.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
OPPORTUNITY ZONES
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I thank
Senator ERNST for allowing me the op-
portunity to talk about opportunity
zones.
So much has happened since Presi-
dent Trump has been elected that I
think has brought opportunity. The
economy is obviously booming. In the
State of Indiana, for instance, we have
156 opportunity zones in 83 different
cities and 58 counties. That is a lot in
one State. This is investment into
these areas that need jobs. Capital in-
vestment is hard to measure. Thank
goodness it has come along and has
been an opportunity that we in the
Hoosier State have taken advantage of.
We are one of the lowest unemploy-
ment States in the Union. I am from
Dubois County, from the town of Jas-
per, which supports the lowest unem-
ployment rates in our State—a State of
enterprise, a State of commerce. Work-
force development is probably the most
critical issue that faces our State, but
we do a lot of other things well. We live
within our means. We addressed infra-
structure back in 2017 by repairing
roads and bridges and by doing a lot of
things well.
We have 80,000 jobs in our State that
need one simple thing, and that is
proper training.
When I went to school back in the
seventies—it dates me a little bit—I
took industrial arts. You had a shop
class. You had a welding class. You had
practical training that led you into
good-paying jobs. Somewhere along the
way, we kind of almost stigmatized
that pathway called career and tech-
nical education. We have schools like
Ivy Tech. When I was a State legis-
lator, there were 19 different programs,
and we were spending nearly $1 billion
a year, but we were not providing prop-
er training for high-demand, high-wage
jobs.
In our State, we are shipping out
twice as many 4-year degrees as we use.
Something is not right. I just spoke
with an online college, which is an-
other issue I want to mention. The cost
of these 4-year degrees has gotten way
out of hand. Many graduates spend
$80,000, $90,000, $100,000. They take on
that debt and have jobs that are not
marketable.
We need to pay attention to the sim-
ple things that most States need by re-
orienting the focus of education and
providing proper training for jobs that

in many cases pay more than 4-year de-
grees, those that start in the neighbor-
hood of $40,000 to $60,000 and have good
benefits and potential wages of over
$100,000 a year. In our State and in
most States across the country, those
are the jobs that need to be filled.
In my own company, 80 jobs can’t be
filled because, really, there needs to be
a better curriculum at the high school
level, one from which you get basic
skills taught rather than the mis-
guided approach of overemphasizing 4-
year degrees. There is nothing wrong
with that, and everyone should aspire
to that, but the market doesn’t nec-
essarily need it. It will pay more for a
lot less education, and you will not be
walking away with the debt that so
many students do in this day and age.
Tax reform then came along. As a
business owner, I can clearly say that
there has been nothing in the 38 years
of building a little Main Street busi-
ness into a national company that has
catapulted our ability to do more for
our employees than what has happened
with tax reform.
An opportunity zone is a great idea.
We need to have more of it, and we
need to make sure this institution
starts to set an example across this
country whereby we live within our
means and not create $850 billion defi-
cits annually on top of $22 trillion of
debt. We all know that is going to lead
us nowhere other than into despair
down the road.
Again, I am here to tout what tax re-
lief and the JOBS Act did, as well as
opportunity zones, which we have run
with in the Hoosier State. We also need
to fix a few things, like matching
training and education with high-de-
mand, high-wage jobs. If we do that
across the country, I think we will be
into decades of prosperity that will
prevent us from maybe going down
that trail of some of the things we have
heard about recently, like the Green
New Deal, Medicare for All, and a lot of
things that we know we can’t afford
and that will not work.
Thank you.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
PERDUE). The Senator from South
Carolina.
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr.
President, I thank Vice Chair ERNST
for putting this event together on the
floor to talk about the success of op-
portunity zones and what they could
mean for so many Americans who des-
perately need the assistance in so
many places. Without any question,
this is a great part of the tax bill that
has not received enough attention. A
lot of folks know about opportunity
zones, and a lot of folks are excited
about opportunity zones.
I would like to spend a little time
talking about the success of our econ-
omy and touching on some of the
issues that my colleague Senator
BRAUN spoke about as well, those being
the importance of workforce develop-
ment and of making sure our workforce
has the skills that meet the jobs of our
current economy.
One estimate said that perhaps there
are a million more jobs than there are
people looking for work, and a part of
the reason why that is so is because we
still need to make sure that we har-
monize the skill set necessary to do the
work with the skills being taught or
trained to our younger folks and folks
looking for work.
This has been an amazing journey
from an economic perspective, when
you think about where we are finan-
cially as a country.
This past quarter we saw the an-
nouncement of a growth rate of around
3.2 percent. That is astounding because
all of the estimates were so signifi-
cantly lower.
We finished 2018 with a growth rate
of around 3.1 percent. Now, we have not
seen that acceleration in our economy
in a very long time. So it is really good
news for those folks looking for work.
Our unemployment rate is near a 50-
year low—somewhere between 3.8 and
3.9 percent. This is something we
haven’t seen in a very long time. Afri-
can-American unemployment is near 7
percent. Some of the lowest numbers
ever recorded in the history of the
country for African-American employ-
ment are there now. Hispanic unem-
ployment is in the same range—very
low, record lows.
We have seen wages in the last sev-
eral months continue to increase. Wage
growth is now hitting the bottom quin-
tile of our workforce at a 3-percent
growth rate, which is really good news
because it was another one of those
targets that we knew was important
for us to reach.
Said differently, income disparity is
shrinking because of the success of our
Tax Code and the success of our regu-
latory reset, and that is good news for
everyone.
The economic recovery, however, has
been uneven. Part of the challenge that
we see is that there are areas of our
Nation that are not doing as well as
the numbers I have just indicated.
That reinforces the fact that, as a
whole, the Nation is succeeding and the
people of our country are succeeding at
a much higher level and at a faster
clip. However, rural America still lags
a little behind and needs more tools in
the toolkit, more arrows in the quiver
to address some of the challenges that
are endemic and specific to those rural
parts of our country.
I am thankful to have partnered in
the opportunity zone legislation with
folks who are compassionate and who
are committed to making sure that
rural America realizes its full poten-
tial.
I have had an opportunity to travel
this country on my national oppor-
tunity zone tour. I have gone from
places in Florida, with Senator RUBIO,
to parts of our country that I have
really enjoyed seeing, but I can’t ar-
ticulate fully the passion that I saw in
folks from West Virginia, New Hamp-
shire, and Iowa when we had a chance
to tour these three States and learn
more about the rural economy and the
potential in those rural economies.
I remember vividly walking down in
Huntington, WV, with my good friend
Senator CAPITO. We had a great visit in
Huntington, WV, and what we realized
there was the passion of the people and
the willingness to work were evident
and that we needed to bring more re-
sources to the table so that the em-
ployers and would-be employers would
make the investment in Huntington,
WV, and in other parts of rural West
Virginia.
We left there encouraged and enthu-
siastic because the opportunity zone
legislation was seen as a true tool in
the toolkit for rural America that
needed to be rolled out. At that time,
it hadn’t been rolled out like it has
been now.
So today we see over $100 billion mi-
grating toward opportunity funds. That
means good news for rural America. If
we are able to continue that progress,
we will see rural America live its full
potential, and that is great news.
I enjoyed visiting New Hampshire
with Governor Sununu, where the un-
employment rate is 2.4 percent, one of
the lowest in the country. But even in
a place like New Hampshire, where the
unemployment rate is really low, the
rural parts of the State were still dev-
astated and needed an infusion of hope
and opportunity. The O zone, or the op-
portunity zone, has presented itself as
one of the many solutions necessary to
confront some of the rural issues that
we saw in New Hampshire.
I enjoyed my time in West Des
Moines with Senator ERNST, as we had
a chance to visit a potential housing
project incubator at a church, where
folks were fascinated by using the tax
deferral to encourage and to attract
more investment into West Des Moines
because the people are willing to work.
There is dignity in all work, and they
understood that. They were passionate
about opportunities, and they needed
another tool to make it happen.
Opportunity zones are a part of that
toolkit, and I will say, without any
question, that when you think about
great leadership, it is hard to have
missed the compassion and the passion
that JONI ERNST has for her constitu-
ents and her business owners and her
willingness to partner with legislation
like the opportunity zones and partner
with the entrepreneurs of her State
and the folks who are looking for ways
to reinvest in their own neighborhoods
to help encourage and to support a
willing workforce.
That tool of opportunity zones can be
brought to bear against some of the
strongest and hardest challenges in
rural America, and I am here to say
thank you to my colleagues for, a,
making sure that opportunity zones
are a reality; b, for taking this time on
the floor to encourage others, espe-
cially our rural Americans, to stay
hopeful; and, c, to continue to address
some of the challenges that Senator
BRAUN mentioned about the workforce

development and harmonizing the skill
set with the workforce in a way that
allows for those folks to realize their
full potential and live the American
Dream.
I yield to Senator CAPITO.
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia.
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I want
to thank my colleague Senator TIM
SCOTT from South Carolina. I am going
to talk a little bit about our visit later,
but our visit was really tremendous in
West Virginia.
ORDER OF PROCEDURE
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that all postcloture
time on the Brasher nomination expire
at 3 p.m. today and that, if confirmed,
the motion to reconsider be considered
made and laid upon the table and the
President be immediately notified of
the Senate’s action.
I further ask that following disposi-
tion of the Brasher nomination, the
Senate vote on the motion to invoke
cloture on the Ruiz II, Arias-Marxuach,
and Wolson nominations in the order
listed, and that if cloture is invoked on
the nominations, the postcloture time
on the nominations expire at 10:30 a.m.
on Thursday, May 2, and the Senate
vote on confirmation of the nomina-
tions in the order in which cloture was
invoked; and finally, if confirmed, that
the motions to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table and
the President be immediately notified
of the Senate’s action.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
any objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
OPPORTUNITY ZONES
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I am
here to join my colleagues today to
speak about what I believe is one of the
most significant parts of the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act that we passed a little
over a year ago, and that is the oppor-
tunity zones.
Senator SCOTT is the author and the
brains behind this concept that he has
been working on for years, and I was
really proud to be a cosponsor of that
bill and am excited to see what is going
to happen.
Ever since that historic legislation
that we passed and became law in 2017,
I have heard from many individuals,
families, and small businesses back in
West Virginia about all the ways that
they have benefited from this. I have
met with families who have been able
to save for their children, whether it is
to increase their children’s education
or to actually get some things done
around the house that they hadn’t been
able to afford before.
I have spoken with small businesses
that have been able to expand their op-
erations and create new jobs. I have
heard from individuals who have been
able to give back to their churches and
to their communities. I have seen—
which, I think, may even be the most
significant—a renewed sense of opti-
mism and hope about where our econ-
omy is going, not just in our State but
across the country.
Many critics of the tax cut legisla-
tion said folks like those living in West
Virginia wouldn’t feel the positive ef-
fects, but I can tell you that we have
experienced that in West Virginia.
Those same critics then said that the
benefits would only be temporary.
I heard Senator SCOTT talk about the
growth figures over the last quarter. It
is phenomenal. I have seen figures in
West Virginia of how wage growth is
increasing and how our annual salaries
are increasing.
Our unemployment still remains a
little bit high, but it is still moving
down over the last month.
As recently as last week, I met a
small business owner in South Charles-
ton who is currently creating new jobs
because of that tax reform.
But thanks to a specific provision in
the tax reform bill—a provision, as I
said, that Senator SCOTT sponsored and
that several of our colleagues joined
in—I am positive that the new tax law
will continue to drive economic growth
and optimism through opportunity
zones.
Now there is no State better made
for an opportunity zone investment
than our State. I am going to sell it
right here.
As my colleagues before me have ex-
plained, the idea is quite simple. It is
to incentivize private investment in
communities that need it the most—
communities that, for one reason or
another, have struggled more than oth-
ers economically and that have been
hit hard and are in need of not just a
little but a major jump start. They are
communities full of great people—peo-
ple with great ideas and strong ambi-
tion—but they are in need of the cap-
ital to get those ideas off the ground,
to start and expand their businesses,
and to drive that growth and develop-
ment.
That is something that is really not
easy to do in a small State, particu-
larly a small rural State. It is very dif-
ficult.
The New York Times actually re-
ported recently that the rural areas
around our country accounted for just
3 percent of America’s job growth be-
tween the years of 2010 and 2014.
But with the creation of the oppor-
tunity zones, enthusiasm is growing
across the Mountain State when it
comes to our economic potential.
Senator SCOTT talked about his visit
to Huntington, and he did remark on
the enthusiasm that he saw firsthand
when he visited with me and we toured
3 of our State’s 55 opportunity zones.
During that visit, we met with a lot of
businesses. We met with local and gov-
ernment leaders, and we met with edu-
cation officials and city officials about
how opportunity zones can shape
growth in that community, as well as
in others across our State.
I think Senator SCOTT would agree
that the optimism was there and the
excitement was palpable.
The mayor of Huntington, Mayor
Steve Williams, actually put it best
when he characterized the trip as an
opportunity to show not only what the
community has been able to do to at-
tract investment but, better yet, what
the community aspires to do and be-
come in the next generations or the
next decades.
That is really what opportunity
zones are all about—not only driving
investments today but building those
foundations of growth and development
for the future.
I think we can all think of an area we
either live near or we have driven
through in our respective States that
maybe used to be vibrant communities,
whether in, say, Wheeling, where they
had a big steel industry at some point,
or in Weston, where there was a glass
industry at some point. The downtowns
have begun to shrink, but they are al-
most like sleeping bears. They are
ready to wake up, and that is what I
think opportunity zones are going to
do.
Today, a little less than a year ago,
the Governor made the appointments
of 55 areas in our State. Law firms, ac-
counting firms, investors, and several
others are working in our State to use
this new tax provision to bring jobs
and growth to parts of our country
that need it the most.
Communities are developing pitch
books—I have seen a couple on the
internet—to market their projects and
proposals. Our city of Parkersburg is a
great example of that. A nonprofit put
together a pitch book that shows where
the investments can occur in and
around those opportunity zones sur-
rounding Parkersburg.
We have also seen the establishment
of our first opportunity fund, called the
Savage Grant.
So we have some great momentum.
We are working to build on it. My staff
has just done an outreach in almost
every single county, and we just fin-
ished a 3-day educational tour in part-
nership with West Virginia Forward,
the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich-
mond, the West Virginia Department of
Commerce, and the Benedum Founda-
tion to spread the word.
Also, nonprofits are really interested
in seeing this work. It takes some of
the pressure off of them. If the private
investor can come in, then the non-
profits can come in and provide some of
the alternative services and additional
services that would be needed.
So we are going to keep at it, and
with Treasury’s release of the most re-
cent opportunity zone regulations, the
program will be a viable tool that will
be more viable than ever for invest-
ments in our operating businesses.
I am confident that West Virginians
and others will make the most of it,
and we should make the most of it be-
cause this is a great idea and a great
opportunity. It is a way to transform
our communities and to improve our
communities and to lift up individuals
and businesses that contribute, and to

build that bigger and greater founda-
tion for a brighter future.
So these are the kinds of opportuni-
ties that, as Republicans, when we
voted for this bill, we knew that this
was a core part of our mission in terms
of being able to deliver that firm foun-
dation, and we are going to continue to
deliver for West Virginians and for all
Americans.
I wish to thank the Senator from
Iowa as well.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa.
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, today we
have an economy that is booming. Un-
employment is at its lowest in Iowa
since 2000, and wages are up.
In the first quarter of this year, we
saw 3.2 percent GDP growth, which far
exceeded expectations, but we know
economic statistics alone don’t com-
pletely tell the story of the health or
wealth of a community.
More than 52 million Americans, in-
cluding approximately 90,000 Iowans,
live in economically distressed commu-
nities. Some have dubbed these com-
munities as ‘‘left behind’’ due to low
incomes, their high housing vacancies,
people out of work, and not a lot of
hope for the future. For too long, so
many of these communities were lim-
ited not because of lack of ingenuity
but simply by a lack of access to oppor-
tunity. Folks across Iowa have felt the
door to a better job or a higher wage
was closed to them.
The Governor of Iowa, Kim Reynolds,
has been doing a tremendous job work-
ing to help these areas through both
economic development and workforce
development efforts. Programs like Fu-
ture Ready Iowa help folks learn the
skills they need to prepare for reward-
ing careers and the jobs of tomorrow.
Places like Dubuque, through its De-
velopment Corporation and Chamber of
Commerce, are working day in and day
out to improve the local economy, spur
on investment, and get workers trained
and back on their feet. They also rec-
ognize the challenges unique to the
city and its people, like childcare ac-
cess and housing.
At the Federal level, we also took
concrete steps in late 2017 to recognize
the specific needs of these commu-
nities. Senator TIM SCOTT’s wonderful
initiative, Investing in Opportunity
Act, was included in the tax reform
package and created what we now
know as the Opportunity Zones Pro-
gram. I thank Senator TIM SCOTT for
working so hard on this opportunity
for millions of Americans. They are
seeing the benefits. Thank you, Sen-
ator, very much.
The Opportunity Zones Program is
tremendous. This program incentivizes
long-term investment in these low-in-
come and distressed communities by
allowing private capital to be used to
support small businesses, encourage
our entrepreneurs, and to develop di-
lapidated properties in ZIP Codes most
in need of resurgence.
From the heart of Des Moines to
rural areas around my State of Iowa,
opportunity zones are beginning to un-
leash the economic potential of Iowa’s
communities.
Nearly a year ago, the Treasury De-
partment approved 62 opportunity
zones in Iowa, which include the com-
munities of more than 200,000 Iowans.
Last summer, as part of his oppor-
tunity zone tour, Senator SCOTT joined
me in visiting two of these Iowa orga-
nizations located in one of the oppor-
tunity zones. He had talked about
these briefly. One was the Des Moines
Dream Center, and the other was the
Phenix School Apartments in West Des
Moines. Since becoming eligible for
private investment, the Des Moines
Dream Center has been able to carry
out their mission of working to restore
hope and helping Iowans to pursue
their dreams.
Today I am proud to say that with
the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act, we are working for Iowa families
and communities to help them turn a
page and to change the rhetoric from
‘‘left behind’’ to ‘‘moving ahead.’’
One of the best parts of the Oppor-
tunity Zones Programs is that it is
powered by the people on the ground,
not by bureaucrats right here in Wash-
ington, DC. That is a very good thing.
The 62 designated opportunity zones
were nominated by their mayors and
Governors because folks back home in
Iowa know where help is needed the
most.
As a result of the Opportunity Zones
Program, we are seeing greater invest-
ment in Iowa’s small businesses and
entrepreneurs, more educational pro-
grams for our children, and affordable
housing for our families.
Opportunity zones can help power a
renaissance in communities across
Iowa and reopen doors families once
thought were closed. The potential is
truly amazing, and I firmly believe this
is only the beginning.
I thank my colleagues for coming to
the floor today. I thank Senator SCOTT
for his wonderful innovation. We look
forward to seeing many more wonder-
ful years of opportunity presented to
the Americans who need it the most.
With that, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio.
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I
would like to join my colleague from
Iowa and my colleague from South
Carolina, Senator SCOTT, to talk about
opportunity zones.
Senator SCOTT has shown incredible
leadership on this issue. He has a big
heart, and he has a passion for dealing
with communities that have been left
behind.
The tax reform bill we passed is
doing a great job in growing the econ-
omy. If you look at the numbers, they
are unbelievable. In the first quarter,
there was a 3.2-percent economic
growth. That is exactly twice what was
projected by the Congressional Budget
Office, a nonpartisan group in Con-
gress, before tax reform was passed.
Now tax reform has passed, and growth
is twice as fast.
By the way, the same is true with job
creation. Over the last year, we have
created twice as many jobs as was pro-
jected before tax reform was passed.
There is no question but that tax re-
form has helped stimulate develop-
ment, helped stimulate economic
growth, and helped stimulate jobs. Ac-
tually, what is most exciting to me is
that it has also increased wages for
people in Ohio and around the country.
Wages have increased higher in the
last year than they have in the pre-
vious decade. You have to go back to
before the great recession to find wage
growth like we have seen. Wage growth
is great across the board, but it is par-
ticularly encouraging that there is
slightly more wage growth among what
is called nonsupervisory jobs—think
about middle-class jobs and blue-collar
jobs. So this thing is working, and it is
working well.
However, the fact is, the prosperity
we are seeing is not evenly spread.
There are some communities that
haven’t recovered since the great reces-
sion, and those are the communities—
low-income communities that have
been stubbornly poverty stricken—that
the enterprise zones and opportunity
zones are meant to focus on. It is a
critical tool, and it is in the tax legis-
lation. It is designed to help encourage
investment and therefore job creation
in these communities.
As I was listening to others talk ear-
lier, they talked about States that are
identifying urban communities and
rural communities that are most in
need. I will tell you that in my State of
Ohio, we now have 320—320—census
tracts that have been identified. When
I am traveling around the State, it
doesn’t take me long to find one of
these census tracts and to talk with
people who are excited about it.
It allows investors and companies to
defer paying these capital gains taxes,
and, in some cases, if they make a com-
mitment for long enough to invest ad-
ditional money, they can avoid the
capital gains tax altogether. This is
working, and over time it is going to
create more investment in these com-
munities.
Throughout the past year, I have
been traveling to Ohio and talking to
people about this. In Youngstown, OH,
and in Cleveland, OH, we had round-
table meetings with investors, busi-
nesses, and community leaders, and
what I have heard is that people are ex-
cited about it. They think there is
great potential here. To ensure that it
works like it is supposed to work, we
have to make sure everybody is in-
volved, and that does include economic
developers and all levels of govern-
ment, not just the businesses and in-
vestors who are interested in getting
the tax incentives. We have to work to-
gether to make sure these programs
work and do expand opportunities in
these communities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2550 May 1, 2019
By the way, I want to highlight the
promising work Ohio has done to bring
everyone to the table to ensure that
happens. Specifically, last week, Gov-
ernor DeWine announced the creation
of a new website to serve as a one-stop
shop for businesses, investors, and eco-
nomic development officials who are
looking to invest in Ohio’s opportunity
zones. The website includes an inter-
active map that shows investors where
the projects are around the State,
streamlining the flow of capital into
these areas that need it most. These
are the kinds of things we need to be
able to ensure that this works prop-
erly.
I am also encouraged by the ongoing
implementation of this program by
Secretary Mnuchin and the Depart-
ment of Treasury. Since the implemen-
tation process began, I have been urg-
ing the Secretary to issue taxpayer-
friendly regulations and rules with re-
gard to this. In other words, look at
our intent—what we intended to do—
which is, again, to create more jobs
and economic opportunities in these
zones. This includes a letter we sent,
which was bicameral—meaning both
the House and the Senate—and bipar-
tisan to Treasury that named a number
of concerns we had about where we
were up to that point in terms of the
regulations. We asked for some further
guidance on a number of threshold
questions that investors were asking
about, including clarifying an onerous
proposal that was out there that oppor-
tunity zone businesses have to make 50
percent of their revenues within their
specific zones. That doesn’t make sense
for some businesses. I mean, think
about a restaurant that is going to be
built in an opportunity zone. If they
don’t get 50 percent of the revenue
from people who live in that commu-
nity, that is not necessarily a bad
thing. We want to be sure they are hir-
ing people from that community, but it
may be that this 50-percent rule does
not work for all of these businesses, in-
cluding the ones that are going to sell
to the outside or maybe even sell to
other countries from an opportunity
zone.
A few weeks ago, Treasury issued a
second set of regulations that took im-
portant steps to responding to each of
the requests we laid out in our January
letter. I am pleased to see that, specifi-
cally, they addressed the 50-percent
revenue requirement, providing safe
harbors that seem to allow operating
businesses to generate revenue outside
of their opportunity zones without the
risk of losing those tax incentives.
Again, I commend the Secretary and
the Department for taking these steps.
We need that kind of certainty in order
to ensure we take full advantage of
this great opportunity. With the re-
lease of these new regulations, many
more investors are going to have cer-
tainty to start making these invest-
ments in struggling communities
throughout Ohio.
Overall, I am excited about the bene-
fits of this new tax incentive, and I am
committed to doing everything I can
do to make sure Ohio communities
benefit from it.
Thank you.
I yield back my time.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado.
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ap-
preciate the words my colleague from
Ohio has started with and shared and
the work done by this Chamber not
only to cut taxes and grow our econ-
omy for businesses and entrepreneurs
around the country but for individuals,
small towns, and families.
I live in a town of about 3,000 people.
It is a little, tiny town. Growing up, we
had two stoplights, and thanks to some
of the oil and gas development that
took place around our town several
years back, we now have a third stop-
light. It is big time now. The reason it
is, is because we allowed innovation to
flourish. We allowed technology to de-
velop new ways to develop our energy
resources, but while the policies in the
field and in commerce have advanced,
sometimes the policies in this place
have grown stale. That is why I was ex-
cited to support the tax cuts of last
Congress that have energized our econ-
omy, that have created new oppor-
tunity for American workers and fami-
lies, and that have led to billions of
dollars being brought back into the
United States from overseas.
Of course, one of the provisions many
of my colleagues have talked about
today is the Opportunity Zones Pro-
gram that was established in the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act. When we were get-
ting the Opportunity Zones Program
up and running, as a cosponsor of that
legislation, my office heard complaints
that there might not be enough money
for the investments that would be uti-
lized within these opportunity zones.
In fact, we heard from people who were
saying that no one would be interested
in starting a business in struggling
American communities. Other critics
complained it would be too tempting to
pick only census tracts that were al-
ready well-positioned for growth. What
I am hearing and seeing in Colorado
have proven both of those criticisms
wrong.
Clarity is the compass to navigating
any new venture. Treasury has been ac-
tively working to make sure its regula-
tions best position the Opportunity
Zones Program for success.
Real estate investments have experi-
enced early success with this program;
however, we need more than just real
estate investments to make all of
America and all of Colorado pros-
perous. Operational businesses and
other entities will support the long-
term successes of these communities as
well—not just real estate, the oper-
ational side.
With its second round of regulations
recently released, operating businesses
received much awaited, positive news
from the Treasury. Industries like
clean energy, new breweries, or other
capital-heavy businesses received the
clarification they need for opportunity
zones to succeed. These critical tax
provisions—those for accelerated de-
preciation—will encourage money to
come off the sidelines and will trans-
late into large investments in our com-
munities.
While we are still in the infancy of
the Opportunity Zones Program, Colo-
rado already has roughly 40 projects in
the works. The Office of Economic De-
velopment and International Trade,
which is the office tasked with imple-
menting opportunity zones in Colo-
rado, has been working alongside local
and State entities to maximize its pro-
grams for Coloradans. It is in an effort
to ensure that the 126 opportunity
zones—of which about 60 percent are in
rural areas—are successful.
I am going to make sure we continue
to fight to leave no part of Colorado be-
hind, and the Investing in Opportunity
Act will promote growth in all four
corners of our great State.
That little tiny town that I talked
about is going to benefit from the op-
portunity zones that take place.
Whether it is a new manufacturing
plant, a pizza shop, or a movie theater,
investments like these will make a
world of difference to small commu-
nities. It is the difference between peo-
ple staying in the town they love
versus being forced to leave and find a
different job.
Let me give an example. There is a
jewelry store in Wray, CO, Amos Jew-
elry. It is on the main street of this lit-
tle town. My guess is that when this
jewelry store leaves, if there is nobody
to take over the business, maybe that
will be just one more empty storefront
in that town. Nobody will come in to
take it over. There is no Zales or Kay
Jewelers that is going to come in and
replace this smalltown jewelry store.
But through an opportunity zone and
the chances we are giving people to in-
vest in rural areas and underinvested
areas, maybe there can be new life
breathed into these small commu-
nities—that business, that jewelry
store and others like it—to make sure
that we don’t lose businesses and to
make sure that we grow active busi-
nesses and that we start new businesses
as well.
It is the difference between having
access to services on our local Main
Street—like that jewelry store; like
fixing a watch—and being forced to
travel to the next town over and tak-
ing the dollars out of that town and
bringing them to a different city. It is
the difference between going out at all
and staying home. A boarded-up store-
front tells people to go somewhere else;
it is not a ‘‘Welcome Home’’ sign. When
those boards are taken down, the town
comes back to life—new spirit, new op-
portunity. Opportunity zones have the
potential to take those boards down
and to revive our Main Streets.
Whether it is small towns, big cities,
or midsized economies and commu-
nities, the zone shares one common
trait: They are communities across

America that have been left behind.
These opportunity zones can unlock in-
vestment, rebuild infrastructure, and
rebuild hope for so many struggling
families who no longer feel they have
the ability to climb America’s eco-
nomic ladder—those opportunities that
were in reach for America’s previous
generations.
Looking ahead, it will be important
to ensure that these real estate and
commercial developments are bene-
fiting community members. We know
that with new businesses comes new
job opportunities, which in turn pro-
vide investments in struggling edu-
cation systems and housing markets. It
is a tide that lifts all ships. In the end,
these investments are aimed to help all
families who are working to pay rent,
to become homeowners, and to pay
down a mortgage.
We need to work together across the
aisle to ensure that we develop a pipe-
line for the next generation of workers
to enter these new job markets, be-
cause each and every person in Colo-
rado and everyone across our great Na-
tion should have access to the Amer-
ican dream.
I was pleased that not too long ago,
at a White House conference hosted
over at the White House, the mayor of
Silt, CO, was able to join in the discus-
sion at the Opportunity Zones Con-
ference. Mayor Keith Richel and other
officials from Colorado met in Wash-
ington, DC, to discuss opportunities,
and I am very pleased they were able to
do this.
I hope my colleagues, instead of
fighting to repeal the tax law, which
included opportunity zones, will in-
stead embrace the opportunity to in-
vest, to grow, and to create more pros-
perous communities.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as
chairman of the Senate Finance Com-
mittee, I have worked to secure tax
policies to help spur entrepreneurship,
competition, and innovation. Oppor-
tunity zones are a perfect example of
the type of tax policy that creates that
kind of growth in our economy.
Opportunity zones were created
under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed
by the President in December 2017.
That bill stimulates economic develop-
ment and job creation across the coun-
try by incentivizing long-term invest-
ments in economically distressed
neighborhoods. Last year, more than
8,700 census tracts were identified as
opportunity zones by the Governors of
each of the 50 States. These zones are
home to approximately 31 million
Americans, or roughly 10 percent of the
population.
Even in just this short period, we are
already seeing wage increases within
these economically distressed areas
after their having been designated as
opportunity zones. For example, during
the second and third quarters of last
year, our counties with a large pres-
ence of opportunity zones experienced
an annualized wage growth of 8 per-
cent. That is compared to other eco-
nomically distressed counties that
were not designated as zones, which did
not see a significant spike in wages.
We are also seeing States across the
country showing an interest in oppor-
tunity zones, with at least 17 State leg-
islators considering their own oppor-
tunity zone measures at the State
level.
Although States can’t make direct
investments into the Federal oppor-
tunity zone projects, many are consid-
ering measures to encourage initia-
tives such as solar energy or affordable
housing. Even in my home State of
Iowa, cities such as Iowa City and
Coralville have made local investments
in their economically distressed com-
munities and are actively recruiting
investors for development projects in
their opportunity zone areas.
I also want to applaud the efforts of
the Treasury Department to provide
much needed clarity for community
leaders and investors. These include
two packages of proposed regulations
dedicated to implementing opportunity
zone rules.
As the Treasury Department works
to finalize these regulations and pro-
vide other guidance, I will continue
working with Secretary Mnuchin,
States and cities, and the investment
community to ensure that opportunity
zones succeed in driving new business
investment and activity to America’s
low-income communities.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.

BARR HEARING
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, we
have now had a day where the Attorney
General testified before the Judiciary
Committee, and many issues are not
resolved because there are great dis-
crepancies based on Mr. Mueller’s let-
ter that has been made public—two let-
ters, in fact, that have been made pub-
lic between what Mr. Barr has been
saying and what Mr. Mueller believes.
The cloud that hangs over our coun-
try because of Russian interference in
our elections—and, frankly, that hangs
over the President because of the ac-
tions Mr. Mueller outlined in his re-
port—remains. There is a great need to
clear all of that up and to clear all of
it up with no ands, ifs, or buts.
I was shocked when I heard the chair-
man of the Judiciary Committee, my
friend and colleague whom I have trav-
eled with, LINDSEY GRAHAM, come out
of the hearing and say that he was not
going to call Mueller for a hearing. The
fact that he on his own, despite the de-
sires of many other members of the
committee, would simply say that
Mueller is not going to testify was so
outrageous and wrong. So I went to my
colleague here on the floor—my friend
LINDSEY GRAHAM. I said to him: How
can you do this? This is outrageous.
He said: I am just going to ask Mr.
Mueller in a letter if Barr said any-
thing misleading or inaccurate but not
have the hearing.
I was appalled.
Now I see on a tweet by a reporter,
Emma Dumain, that LINDSEY GRAHAM
has slightly modified what he has said.
He said that if Mueller tells GRAHAM in
the letter that Barr said anything mis-
leading or inaccurate today, he would
have the hearing. That is not good
enough. That is a game. He should not
put the onus on Mr. Mueller, a straight
arrow, somebody who believes in a
chain of command, to publicly state
that in a letter.
Mueller should come testify—no
ands, ifs, or buts. Mueller should come
testify—no games as to what he an-
swers in a letter.
What are our colleagues so afraid of
on the other side of the aisle? Are they
afraid Mueller might say things that
are different than what Attorney Gen-
eral Barr said? Are they afraid for the
country to discuss the kinds of things
the President has done, which nobody
much seems to like? Are they afraid
that we talk about foreign interference
in our elections?
I would plead with my colleague
LINDSEY GRAHAM to reconsider. I would
plead with my colleague LINDSEY GRA-
HAM to say: Mueller is coming; no ands,
ifs, or buts so we can question him, in-
cluding our side of the aisle. That is
what Congressional oversight is about.
It is not about the chairman of the Ju-
diciary Committee deciding what
should be heard and what should not be
heard. That is not the job of the chair-
man of the Judiciary Committee, no
matter who he or she is.
Special Counsel Mueller just con-
cluded one of the most important in-
vestigations in our Nation’s history.
The Senate and the American people
have a right to hear from the special
counsel directly about the threat of
foreign interference in our elections
and, yes, the conduct of the President.
It is one of the biggest takeaways from
the hearing; that we need the special
counsel here to testify, to clarify the
discrepancies between what he and the
Attorney General are saying. We don’t
need a letter. We don’t need conditions.
That seems like a game, a dodge, a
ruse, a way to prevent Mr. Mueller
from testifying.
In my view, Attorney General Barr
routinely mischaracterizes the special
counsel’s words, his intentions, his rea-
soning. We know, from the special
counsel’s letter that was publicly re-
leased, that to be true. It is likely that
Attorney General Barr did so again in
the hearings. We need to hear from the
special counsel himself to sort this out
and get the truth, not at the discretion
of the Judiciary Committee chairman
but because America, our system of
government, our rule of law, demands
it.
Congress has always had, from the
days of the Founding Fathers, a duty
to provide oversight for the executive
branch. Just because one party doesn’t
feel like doing it because the President
is from the same party doesn’t measure
up to the grandness of our Constitu-
tion.
My dear friend from South Carolina,
please rethink your position. Back off
of this idea that Mueller shouldn’t tes-
tify or should only testify if he meets
certain conditions only set by you and
call Special Counsel Mueller in to tes-
tify.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri.
MISSOURI FLOODING
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, we
have been stuck for some time now on
having an appropriations bill that
meets the disasters that have occurred
recently in Missouri and, before that,
in the Carolinas and Georgia, and other
places. I want to continue to work hard
to get that done, but I want to talk a
little bit about the effects of what has
happened in the State of Missouri as
part of what has happened with floods
this spring.
We have seen catastrophic and, in
some cases, historic flooding both on
the Missouri and the Mississippi Rivers
over the last couple of months. Along
the Missouri, there was this unusual
thing, and I actually never heard the
term before, a ‘‘bomb cyclone.’’ It is a
wind event that also produced lots of
rain in Nebraska in the Northern
Plains on frozen ground. All of that
water had no place to go except run off,
and it was the equivalent of 8 inches of
rain in a place from which we usually
don’t get water. There had been signifi-
cant rain over the last few days of
March. That created another flood. On
the Mississippi, we have seen signifi-
cant rains there. While they haven’t
set a record, they have certainly con-
sistently ranked the Mississippi crests
among the seventh highest flood levels
that river has ever been from some of
the locks. There are locks north of St.
Louis. You can navigate the river with-
out locks south of St. Louis, but in the
area from the Canton Lock and Dam to
the Winfield Lock and Dam on the Mis-
sissippi, there are significant problems
waiting to happen over the next few
weeks.
After the rains occurred in North-
west Missouri and in Iowa and Ne-
braska, in our State and Kansas, much
of the water is still there. The floods
have stayed up so high for so long that
it is difficult to really evaluate the
damage that has been done. Unlike a
tornado, which we have some famili-
arity with, where you can go in quickly
and evaluate what happened, you can’t
do that nearly as quickly with a flood.
We do know there has been at least
$25 million in damages to public infra-
structure and costs of emergency meas-
ures experienced statewide. There have
been 215 road closures statewide, with
46 roads that continue to be closed as
late as the third week in April. Inter-
state 29, north of St. Joseph, has been
closed since March and is expected to
stay closed until probably June.
This is obviously a very disruptive
set of circumstances for people who
would normally use those roads and
bridges all the time. One of the major
class 1 roadways has been damaged.
That roadway was just raised in 2011 to
deal with the flood in 2011. An ethanol
plant was knocked offline. Electric
substations have been damaged. Grains
stored in bins from last year’s harvest
have been destroyed. Livestock have
been lost. Many farmers will not be
able to get crops in the ground this
year because it will be too wet once the
water goes down—until it is too late to
successfully plant the crops. So thou-
sands of acres and hundreds of farms
just simply will not be able to do what
they do because of the flood.
The scale and scope of these events
has clearly overwhelmed local govern-
ments, overwhelmed county govern-
ments, and stretched the State govern-
ment in a significant way. Most effec-
tively, and most importantly, it has
impacted families and individuals. If
your home is underwater, if it takes 2
more hours to get to school, if you
have no chance of planting your crop
or if you are in a business that relates
to the family who is going to plant the
crop, if you have nobody buying the
seed or paying the repairs for their
equipment, paying for the gasoline—
the things you do to stay in business—
that has all kinds of impact as well.
The Governor of Missouri has re-
quested a Presidential disaster declara-
tion. I am certainly for that, and every

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2554 May 1, 2019
Member of the Missouri delegation
signed the letter asking the President
to grant that declaration. The assist-
ance that would be impacted by this
would be vital. It is important. We
need that kind of assistance now.
I am going to continue to work—and
I hope all our colleagues continue to
work—to make this year’s disasters
and last fall’s disasters eligible for the
funds we appropriate for disaster cov-
erage.
During the flood, a lot has been said
about the Corps of Engineer’s manage-
ment of the Missouri River, and what,
if anything, they could have done that
might have prevented the flood this
time. I think probably not. This is such
an unusual flood that the locks on the
Missouri were north of where the flood
occurred. There was a dam that broke
that would not normally have broken,
and that would normally not even be
part of the Missouri River management
system.
The Corps has been out there trying
to help figure out how to recover rath-
er than figure out what caused this
particular flood. In fact, the Corps and
the permanent staff in places like the
Kansas City office of the Corps under-
stand the Missouri River better than
anybody, in my view, and are helpful
when they can be.
That doesn’t mean the Corps, in a
greater sense, isn’t responsible for
what has become the new normal on
the Missouri River. We have had recur-
rent historic flooding on the river now
for 15 years. Ever since the Corps asked
for a new management plan in 2004 and
got the new management plan, it just
simply doesn’t work.
At least 6 of the top 10 river crests in
recorded history have occurred in the
last 15 years. Floods in 2007, 2008, 2009,
2011—you see the pattern here—2013,
and 2019. The only reason we didn’t
have dramatic floods every year was we
had a couple of drought years in 2009
and 2012.
This all goes back to that 2004 man-
agement plan. What changed in 2004? In
2004, the Corps started to implement
the Missouri River Recovery Program
in response to a Biological Opinion—
‘‘opinion’’ may be the key word here—
Biological Opinion from the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, which took the
position that the existing management
of the river was impacting one species
of fish and two species of birds.
The ultimate result was prioritizing
the management of the entire river to
benefit that fish and those birds. It was
above flood control. It was above navi-
gation. It didn’t consider what was det-
rimental to families, to farms, or the
local infrastructure and was not nec-
essary. Saving wildlife is a worthy
goal, but for that goal to truly be wor-
thy, it has to also include how it im-
pacts families, how it impacts people,
and how it impacts the economy.
We had management plans on the
Mississippi River as well, but the wild-
life management plans didn’t become
the plan that substituted for all other
plans.
The Corps’ management plan brought
about changes to the lower river. There
are six locks and there are six dams,
rather, and reservoirs above the Lower
Missouri that starts roughly in the
place where Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa,
and Missouri all come together. What
happened was they began to destabilize
the banks, constructing pallid sturgeon
chutes that impacted how the water
ran into the river. They no longer
dredged the river like they had before.
Just to understand why that matters, a
9-foot channel of the river carries a lot
more water than a 6- or 7-foot channel
of the river. If you are channeling the
river so you can still navigate the
river, they had interception rearing
complexes, none of which appears to
have made much of a difference, except
they made it hard to control the river
at flood stage.
Modifying or eliminating the river
control systems eliminate the normal
things in a river, such as revetments,
wing dikes, and chevrons that control
the river and send the water in the di-
rection it needs to be for flood protec-
tion, and that just didn’t happen.
Fish and Wildlife and the Corps of
Engineers actually now know that
some of the actions they were carrying
out caused direct negative impacts on
the river and didn’t do any good. There
is a high level of certainty that when
you notch a dike in the river—which
means you cut a hole in a structure
that is designed to channel the water—
that when you do that, bad things hap-
pen. That is why that structure was
put there in the first place for a reason.
One of the most disappointing parts
of what has happened is a relatively
low level of certainty that any of these
things do any good. In fact, the Corps
and the Fish and Wildlife people have
already abandoned the pursuit of what
they constructed, pallid sturgeon
chutes, which they thought would en-
courage the pallid sturgeon to mul-
tiply. By the way, this is a fish we hap-
pen to multiply ourselves at the Neo-
sho National Fish Hatchery, which I
believe is the oldest fish hatchery in
the United States. The U.S. hatchery
system is in Neosho. Pallid sturgeon is
one of the things they do. They didn’t
work, but they did encourage more
flood risk.
I would have one suggestion for the
Corps: If you know an action will in-
crease flood control and you know it
will harm people and harm property
and you don’t know whether it will
help save a species, don’t do it. There
has to be a way you figure out first
whether this is going to work, and then
you might evaluate if it is so impor-
tant that we are going to impact peo-
ple and property.
What we had is a big experiment that
turned out to be the wrong thing to do
to start with. It didn’t serve the pur-
pose, and it did harm the river and peo-
ple who live on the river. Flood control
and navigation needs to be, once again,
elevated to the top two priorities of
managing the river. I look forward to
working with my colleagues to figure
out how to do this in a better way.
There is no question that the Mis-
sissippi River is about to be more im-
portant than it has been in 100 years.
There is also no reason that the Mis-
souri River, as an avenue of commerce
and as an avenue that people can get
near and enjoy from a tourist’s and
traveler’s perspective, can’t be there,
and there is no reason it can’t continue
to be managed in a way that benefits
families, that benefits us economically,
and that doesn’t repeat year after year
after year the flooding that did not
occur under the original management
plan.
We need to look at that plan. We
need to have a management plan that
meets the commonsense standard. The
current plan does not, and we have had
now 15 years to prove that the current
plan does not meet it. I am going to be
working hard with both the Corps, the
Department of the Interior, and Fish
and Wildlife to see if we can’t have a
plan that meets that commonsense
standard.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Georgia.
Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, first of
all, I thank the Senator from Missouri
for his comments about the disaster.
We are having a disaster in the U.S.
Senate because we haven’t been able to
solve our emergency problem yet. It is
not because of Senator BLUNT. He has
done a great job, as have many Mem-
bers of the Senate. We are close now,
and there is a meeting this afternoon
with important Senators. We are close
on Hawaii, on Alaska, on Georgia, on
South Carolina, on Tennessee, on Ala-
bama, on Florida, and on the other
States that have had disasters in the
past year to which we have still been
late on getting disaster emergency
funds.
In fact, in Georgia, this is the 222nd
day, in the case of one emergency, that
those funds have been held up. In the
agricultural season, 222 days is 11⁄2
plants. It is one planting, one picking,
and a second planting. So it is a signifi-
cant part of the agriculture year. We
are getting killed in Georgia. Our
farmers are getting hurt badly because
of the ineptitude, in part and some-
times in whole, of the U.S. Senate.
Finally, cool heads are coming to-
gether. We are getting over some argu-
ments, and we are getting some things
solved. Thanks to the help of Senator
BLUNT and others in the U.S. Senate,
we are going to get help to our farmers
in Georgia, to those in Alabama, and to
those in Alaska from the earthquake
and to those in Hawaii from the lava
flow and the eruptions they have had
there and from all of the other disas-
ters we have had. Finally, that money
is going to start flowing.
REMEMBERING BETTY JO WILLIAMS
Mr. President, I lost two great
friends in the last week—one of them a
Georgian. Nobody in this room knew
her. Her name was Betty Jo Williams,
who was 90 years old.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2555
May 1, 2019
Betty Jo was elected to the Georgia
Legislature in 1978, which was 2 years
after I was elected in 1976 to that same
body. We were two scrawny Repub-
licans in a world of Democrats in Geor-
gia. I was one of the first people to get
elected from Cobb County, which is the
suburban county of Atlanta, and she
was the first woman to get elected to
anything in Georgia. She was one of
the first to break the glass ceiling. A
lot of people may ask: Where is this
glass ceiling? Well, I will tell you
where it is. A lot of people tried to
make their way, but they were always
held back by laws or custom or what-
ever.
Betty Jo fought for women’s rights,
and she fought for women’s rights in
the right way. She saw to it that
women were equally represented and
that they had an opportunity to rep-
resent themselves. She fought hard to
see to it that there was no glass ceiling
to hold back anybody who was trying
to do the right things for the right rea-
sons and had the right qualifications.
I loved Betty Jo. She was great. In
fact, she helped me to get elected as
the minority leader, as the Republican
leader, of the Georgia House of Rep-
resentatives in 1983. I won by one vote.
It was 7 to 6. That shows you how small
a caucus we had. She was one of those
seven who voted for me, and I have
never forgotten it. I am sure, when I
have a funeral one day, somebody will
come and remember on that day some-
thing I did for him. It is something you
never take away.
Betty Jo was a unique person. She
had a husband and three wonderful
children. Her husband passed on, and
she spent the rest of her 25 years of life
living with another gentleman. They
had his children. Between the two of
them, they raised 12 grandchildren, 6
great-grandchildren—wonderful kids
with wonderful opportunities. They
helped those kids grow up to under-
stand the great promise America had.
When Betty Jo served in the legisla-
tive body, even though she was out-
numbered by men by 20 to 1, she was a
woman who broke the glass ceiling.
She also broke custom. In the Georgia
Legislature back in the sixties and sev-
enties, you didn’t find people putting
their numbers in the phonebook. Betty
Jo was the first one. She paid extra to
have her number put in there in big,
bold, black letters. She started the cus-
tom by which, all of a sudden, all who
were in the State legislature got the
Betty Jo Williams rule applied to
them. If they didn’t have their num-
bers in the book, they weren’t in touch
with their constituents. She did little
things like that to make a difference.
She was the first woman to be ap-
pointed to the Judiciary Committee. It
was a great compliment to her, too, for
she was not a lawyer. Even though she
was not a lawyer, she was well re-
spected, even by the speaker of the
house, so she was appointed to the Ju-
diciary Committee.
Speaking of the speaker of the house
in Georgia, his name was Tom Murphy.
I am sure, somewhere in the walls of
this room, his name has been used be-
fore. He was the toughest, most ornery,
hardest working speaker of the house
who ever was. He served as the speaker
of the house in Georgia longer than
any speaker in any house in the United
States of America.
He also didn’t like women represent-
atives, and he let everybody know it.
Yet he couldn’t handle Betty Jo be-
cause she was sweet, kind, and she was
smart, and she always got the best of
him. He would be tough, but she would
be sweet, and she got a lot of things
done that other women couldn’t do be-
cause they would cry. Betty Jo didn’t
cry. She just worked a little harder to
get it done. Tom Murphy finally broke
down and did some things for the
women in the caucus and the women of
the Georgia State Legislature that
hadn’t been done for years—they were
treated more like equals in the legisla-
tive body.
Betty Jo was just one of those spe-
cial, unique individuals who made my
life better by my having known her. I
thank her tonight for the vote she cast
for me a long time ago as minority
leader. I thank her for those children
they raised and great-grandchildren
and children. I thank her for all of the
things she did in her community, for
all of the things she did for women, and
for all of the things she did to make ev-
erybody more equal and more served.
Most importantly of all, I thank her
for breaking that glass ceiling because
there are a lot of women in office today
in this Senate—20 percent of our
body—who wouldn’t be here today if it
had not been for the Betty Jo Williams
of 50 years ago who broke the habits we
had in America that didn’t allow
women to do a lot of things.
I pay tribute to her, and I pay honor
to her for her service and for the great
time I had in knowing her in life. I will
miss her greatly, but I will always be a
better man for knowing Betty Jo Wil-
liams and what she taught me about
life and success.
REMEMBERING RICHARD LUGAR
Mr. President, everybody in this
room, everybody in this Capitol, and
everybody in this country knows who
Dick Lugar was. We lost Dick earlier
this week. Dick Lugar was and is an
American icon.
When I got elected to the U.S. Senate
in 2004, I came here and was put on the
Foreign Relations Committee in 2006,
primarily because we were one Repub-
lican short and because nobody else
would take the seat. So I wasn’t the
unanimous choice; I was the only
choice.
Dick Lugar came to me and said:
Johnny, would you take this seat? I
have to have somebody take this seat,
and I have to have somebody be the
chairman of the Africa Subcommittee.
I said: Well, Dick, I will be happy to
take the seat, but I don’t know a
damned thing about Africa. I have
never been there. I would be a bad
chairman.
He said: No, you wouldn’t. I will take
you over there with me. We will study
it, and you will be great.
Today, 15 years later, I am still on
the Africa Subcommittee. I have been
the chairman of it for half that time. I
fell in love with it because of Dick
Lugar. I have learned more about it,
and America is a better country today
for its being able to open doors in Afri-
ca.
I worked with Dick Lugar on the New
START treaty. Dick Lugar was a quiet
gentleman, but he was a giant when it
came to his ability to solve problems.
He was elected as the mayor of Indian-
apolis, IN, at a time when racial ten-
sions were at their height. He was one
of the most successful mayors in the
history of the country. At the par-
ticular time that he was elected
mayor, he was the most respected
mayor in the country. He received
awards that designated him the best
mayor in America.
He was a man who held on to hope,
who held on to opportunity, and fought
for equality at whatever risk there was
to him to see to it that it happened in
his city. Later, he went on to be elect-
ed to the Indiana Legislature and then
was elected to the U.S. Senate. He was
the longest serving Senator from Indi-
ana in the history of the U.S. Senate.
As I said, I served on his committee
with him, Foreign Relations, but I also
served at the time that Dick got beat-
en. You wouldn’t think a guy who had
served six terms in the Senate and who
had been a Republican would get beat-
en in his own primary by the Repub-
lican Party, but it happened to us. I
know the Acting President pro tempore
remembers those times a few years ago
when our party kind of got divided. We
had tea parties and other types of par-
ties, and people started picking on
folks. All of a sudden, it was a bad
thing to have served for a long time. It
was a bad thing to have been a gentle
giant. It was a bad thing to have been
a guy like Dick Lugar. So they got
some new blood in to shake the place
up, and they beat Dick in the primary.
It was one of the saddest days I ever
had to see. A man who had accom-
plished so much and who was so great
got beaten over things that were really
inconsequential—over political rhet-
oric. It was just to win a point of view,
not to win a case.
I went to Dick after it was over, and
I said: Dick, I am so sorry you lost.
He said: Don’t worry about it. I have
lots to do. I have The Lugar Center. I
have the Lugar-Nunn initiative.
Sam Nunn was the great Senator
from the State of Georgia who, many
years ago, held the seat I have. He and
Dick Lugar did more for nuclear non-
proliferation than any two men in the
history of our country. Dick’s finger-
prints are on every positive nuclear
deal we have ever made in this coun-
try. President Barack Obama gave him
the Congressional Medal of Honor be-
cause of his efforts on behalf of peace.
His efforts were on behalf of the coun-
try and nuclear nonproliferation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2556 May 1, 2019
Sam Nunn and Dick Lugar disman-
tled most of the loose nukes that were
lying on the floor of the Soviet Union
when the wall fell in Berlin. In the
years after that time, he saw to it that
they were disposed of properly rather
than their having gotten into the
hands of some terrorist who would
have made a dirty bomb later on. Dick
Lugar did all of that for his country.
He loved his 604-acre farm back home
in Indiana—his family home—which he
still ran until the day he died. It was
where he served as not a visiting pro-
fessor but as a real professor and not as
an adjunct professor but as a real pro-
fessor. It was where he talked about
peace, love, hope, and humanity. Most
importantly of all, he talked about
people solving the problems of the
world by working together and not
against each other.
I don’t know that I will ever know a
better man than Dick Lugar. I am a
little younger than Dick, although not
by that much. I haven’t served nearly
as long in this body as he had. Yet, in
all of the time I have been here and
from all of the things I have read about
great Members of the Senate and of the
ones I have known, like Sam Nunn
from Georgia, I have never known one
better than Dick Lugar.
As a tribute to Dick—and just so you
will know, the New START treaty is
coming up for renewal in the next cou-
ple of years. The New START treaty is
the treaty by which we broke the ice
on inspecting and verifying nuclear
warheads. Because of what Dick Lugar
and Sam Nunn did and because of what
we did in the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee in the negotiations for that,
along with John Kerry and others, we
saw to it that we got no notice of in-
spections in the Soviet Union and no
notice of inspections in America of our
nuclear warheads.
In 12 hours, we can get somebody to
Moscow. We can knock on the door of
the nuclear storage facility and say:
We are coming in. When we go in, we
can scan the hologram on the nuclear
warhead—it is part of the treaty—
which is embedded so you can count
the warheads. A lot of these nuclear
warheads are not comprised of just 1
bomb—they have 12 or 15. It is so we
will know exactly what they have and
so they will know exactly what we
have.
Knowledge is power. Dick saw to it
that we had the knowledge of what we
had and what they had before we got in
trouble rather than to have an alterca-
tion and then a threat and have to say
that we really didn’t know what they
had or what we had and then to have to
start overcompensating. The next
thing you know, we would be overcom-
pensating with war when we start liv-
ing the lies unnecessarily—when we do
the wrong thing.
When I go down my checklist one of
these days of all of those great people
I had the chance to know, of the people
I learned so much from, of the people I
appreciated were around when I got to
live so my kids could grow up in a
world that was freer and more pros-
perous and more safe than any world
possible, I will know Dick Lugar was
my friend. I will know I had the honor
of serving with him.
To Dick’s family, to his many friends
in Washington, to the people of the
State of Indiana who felt blessed just
by having him so long, Dick lived a
great life.
God bless you. Thank you for your
service.
God bless the United States of Amer-
ica and Dick Lugar.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I
thank my friend from Georgia, who
just gave us some great memories
about Dick Lugar—one of the truly
great Senators who served here in the
last half century. He was a friend and
was someone whom so many of us
looked up to.
One of the things he did that was spe-
cial to Ohio was that he became totally
devoted to his college, Denison Univer-
sity. He served on the board until his
death. He was the longest serving
board member ever, I am sure. He not
only served on the board, but he
showed up. Denison University, which
is in my State of Ohio, is very grateful
for his service, and as a neighbor from
Indiana, again, I miss him, and I appre-
ciate him.
REMEMBERING JOSEPH H. HEAD, JR.
Mr. President, I am here to take a
moment to pay honor to a mentor of
mine who was also one of the great
Ohioans, Joseph H. Head, Jr., who was
known for his leadership, for his un-
wavering loyalty to his city of Cin-
cinnati, OH—my hometown—for his vi-
sion, and for all of his contributions.
He was a tireless contributor to our
community. In fact, I would describe
Joe as a kind of one-person chamber of
commerce for Greater Cincinnati. He
loved his city, and he loved to help
young people. I was a beneficiary of
that.
I first met Joe when I was either in
junior high school or just getting into
high school. As usual, he was very di-
rect. He came up to me and asked me
about my future. I had no idea what
my future was going to be.
He asked: Have you ever been to a
law firm?
I said: No, I have not.
None of my family had been lawyers,
and I hadn’t had any experience with
that.
He said: Why don’t you borrow a tie
from your father and come down to my
law firm.
What do you say to that?
So I said: Yes, I will do that.
I remember I was a little intimi-
dated, but I went downtown with my
tie on—it was a little bit long for me—
and I had an interesting visit with Joe
Head.
Then, when I was in college, Joe
Head gave me my first job in politics.
It was an internship with then-Con-
gressman Bill Gradison. Joe Head had
been the chairman of his efforts and
suggested that I work for him.
Bill Gradison was a Republican from
my hometown, and 16 years later, I
succeeded him in Congress. Trust me, I
had no clue that I was going do that at
the time I interned for him, but that
door was opened by Joe Head.
I went on to practice international
trade law after going to law school.
Again, a lot of that was because of Joe
Head, being exposed to the law through
him. I then came back to Cincinnati
and worked in his law firm, Graydon
Head & Ritchey, where he was man-
aging partner.
Lo and behold, George H.W. Bush got
elected President and asked me to
come to Washington to work in the
White House as Associate Counsel to
the President. Joe Head encouraged me
to do that, but he also encouraged me
to come home when I was done. In fact,
at the farewell party sending me off to
Washington from the law firm, there
was a large card that was presented to
me, and Joe Head wrote on that card:
‘‘Come home when you are done.’’ That
was great advice, maybe some of the
best advice I ever took, because I did
go home, went back to the law firm,
and became a partner in that law firm.
I had not expected to run for Con-
gress, but, again, Bill Gradison had re-
signed unexpectedly, and Joe Head, of
course, chaired my campaign.
He was a guy who didn’t just benefit
people like me; he benefited everybody
in Greater Cincinnati because he was
so involved throughout his life.
In 2016, he and his wife Louise were
honored with the Jake Davis Award
from the Greater Cincinnati Founda-
tion. That is a big deal. It is an annual
award given to only one community-
minded citizen or couple who volunteer
their time and leadership skills to
make Greater Cincinnati a better place
to live and to work. Joe certainly lived
up to that.
Just a couple months ago, Joe also
received another big honor, and that
was the highest honor of the Greater
Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce
called the Great Living Cincinnatian
Award. I had the honor of being there
to watch him receive that award. He
received it for his community service,
his leadership, and his lifetime of help-
ing others in the community—all of his
distinguished accomplishments.
Joe also served his country. Prior to
his service to our community, he
served in Germany with the U.S.
Army’s artillery division for a couple
of years. He also had the Midas touch
in law and in business, both as the

managing partner at the Graydon Head
& Ritchey law firm and then as CEO
and chairman of the Atkins & Pearce
company, an industrial textile busi-
ness.
His active service on area boards was
where he really distinguished himself. I
got into the habit of just calling him
Chairman because he chaired every-
thing. He chaired the Greater Cin-
cinnati Chamber of Commerce, the
Children’s Home of Greater Cincinnati,
the Christ Hospital Board, the Fine
Arts Fund for Cincinnati, and the Cin-
cinnati Business Committee. I know I
have missed a number of entities, insti-
tutions, and nonprofits he chaired. The
point is, no one was a bigger booster or
bigger contributor to our community.
I think I can speak for a lot of people
when I say that we are going to miss
his dedication, his humor, his wisdom,
and his uncanny ability to articulate
and define issues. He was an impressive
leader, a dear friend, and a truly great
Cincinnatian.
To his extraordinary wife, Louise, of
60 years; to his children, Lisa, Jeb, and
Andy, and their spouses, Nirvani, Jack,
and Melanie; to his grandchildren and
his one great-grandchild, Jane and I
send our condolences. We are thinking
about you. Joe was so proud of each
and every one of you.
May we all endeavor to embrace
Joe’s extraordinary commitment to his
community and carry on his profound
legacy.
Godspeed, Joe Head.
Mr. President, I would now like to
yield to my colleague from Delaware
who has just come to the floor, and I
would like to speak after him.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES
STAFF SERGEANT CHRISTOPHER A. SLUTMAN
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want
to thank my friend and colleague from
Ohio for his kindness in yielding to me
today.
I rise this afternoon to pay tribute to
an American hero—this man right
here—an American hero and patriot
who was taken away from us far too
soon.
Earlier last month, I was standing on
the flight line at Dover Air Force Base
alongside Congresswoman LISA BLUNT
ROCHESTER; our colleague in the Sen-
ate, CHRIS COONS; and our Governor,
John Carney. We were there to join the
members of three families who had
come to receive the remains of their
loved ones, all marines who had been
killed in action on April 8—a couple
weeks earlier—when a roadside bomb
went off in Afghanistan near Kabul as
their convey was passing through.
Two of the servicemembers killed
were Active Duty: Cpl Robert A.
Hendriks of Long Island, NY, and SSgt
Benjamin S. Hines of York County, PA,
which is not too far from my State of
Delaware.
There was a third marine, SSgt
Christopher Slutman. Christopher was
a reservist, a 15-year member of the
New York City Fire Department, and a
Delawarean. The 43-year-old U.S. ma-
rine was also a loving husband to his
wife, Shannon, and the father of three
girls: McKenna, age 10; Kenley, age 8;
and Weslynn, age 4.
In life and in death, Staff Sergeant
Slutman epitomized the best of this
country. He selflessly put his life on
the line to protect and serve his coun-
try and his community.
We read in the New Testament these
words, and I will paraphrase them: No
greater love hath a man than his will-
ingness to lay down his life for a friend.
These three marines laid down their
lives for our country, and they also
laid down their lives for a nation we
are allied with, the government and
the people of Afghanistan.
Winston Churchill said a lot of mem-
orable things, but one of the most
memorable to me, a retired Navy cap-
tain, is that a reservist is twice a cit-
izen. A reservist is twice a citizen.
By that measure, Christopher
Slutman was three times a citizen. He
wore two uniforms in service to our
Nation. One of them was this uniform,
the fire department—a 15-year, deco-
rated veteran of the New York City
Fire Department—and also that of a
staff sergeant of the U.S. Marines,
serving in the 25th Marine Regiment,
4th Marine Division in the Marine
Forces Reserve, which is based in Har-
risburg, PA.
Christopher’s family calls him Chris.
Chris had always dreamed of being a
firefighter. He grew up in Maryland. He
graduated from Frederick Douglass
High School, where he played football,
basketball, wrestled, and achieved
Eagle Scout status. As a father of two
Eagle Scouts, that is quite an achieve-
ment. Eventually, he volunteered with
fire departments in Maryland and in
Washington, DC. Most recently, he
spent his time between the Bronx and
Wilmington, DE, where his wife and
three daughters lived full time.
As my colleagues know, I live in
Delaware, and I commute to work here
by train almost every day—3, maybe 4
days a week. Christopher Slutman had
a similar kind of commute. His family
was in Delaware, and instead of coming
this way, he would go north to work as
a firefighter in New York City. He took
the train in the opposite direction to
do his job. He so wanted to serve that
he would travel from his home in Dela-
ware to Ladder Company 27 in New
York City almost every day. In fact, he
was on military leave from Ladder
Company 27 and nearing the end of his
most recent deployment with the Ma-
rine Reserves in Afghanistan when he
and his two comrades lost their lives.
It was for Chris Slutman’s work in
the Bronx that in 2014 he won the Fire
Chiefs Association Memorial Medal for
rescuing an unconscious woman from
the 11th floor of a high-rise apartment
building. I heard a firsthand account of
that rescue, and it tells the story of a
hero and a woman who could easily
have died, and she didn’t, and it was
because of his actions. Staff Sergeant
Slutman lived that kind of profound
love. He dedicated his life to serving
others even at his own peril.
It seems that this kind of selflessness
and devotion to service was a hallmark
of the Slutman household. Staff Ser-
geant Slutman is survived by three
brothers. One of his brothers is in the
Marines, another is in the Army, and
the third is a firefighter in Wash-
ington, DC—right here. Their father
was an Army veteran and was also a
volunteer firefighter, as was Chris
Slutman’s mother. What a family—Ma-
rines, Army, volunteer firefighters,
firefighters up in New York City. I like
to say leadership is leading by exam-
ple. Leaders lead by example. It is not
do as we say, but do as we do. They
provide an incredible example for all of
us.
Last Friday, I was honored to have
been able to join our Governor, John
Carney, and Staff Sergeant Slutman’s
family, friends, and fellow servicemem-
bers in New York City to pay our re-
spects, along with the mayor of New
York City and many other dignitaries
who were there to pay their respects to
a man who gave his life for this coun-
try.
The first speaker at his funeral was
Marine SgtMaj Christopher Arm-
strong—another Christopher—who
served alongside his friend Chris for 8
years. Marine Sergeant Major Arm-
strong remembered Chris Slutman with
these words. Here is what Christopher
Armstrong had to say:
Upon joining the unit, I began observing
the Marines; who they watched, how they
looked at their leaders, and what they said.
There were a small number of men that when
they spoke, silence fell; when they issued an
order, the response was immediate; and when
they were looked upon, it was with rev-
erence. Christopher Slutman immediately
stood out as a leader who was both respected
and admired. He didn’t pound his chest, he
didn’t try to impress or go on about what he
was going to do. He just did it.
He just did it.
Sergeant Major Armstrong contin-
ued:
Chris Slutman placed his Marines’ welfare
before his own. Chris never sought credit,
but he always gave it.
Think about that. That is a good les-
son for all of us, even here. Chris
Slutman never sought credit; he al-
ways gave it to others.
Fire Department New York Commis-
sioner Dan Nigro also spoke. He de-
scribed Chris Slutman as ‘‘the type of
American we can all be proud of.’’ He
continued: ‘‘Chris was a protector of
those in danger and a defender to those
who needed him, a rescuer to those who
needed saving, and a leader who dem-
onstrated his valor on every tour of
duty, both here and abroad.’’ Those are
the words of the Commissioner of the
New York City Fire Department.
I believe there was a poet named
Edgar Guest—like a house guest—
Edgar Guest. I think he spent most of
his life in Detroit, MI. He was often-
times referred as a people’s poet. He

used to say: ‘‘I’d rather see a sermon
than hear one any day.’’ Think about
that. ‘‘I’d rather see a sermon than
hear one any day.’’
Chris Slutman, your life was better
than any sermon.
Chris demonstrated the absolute best
of our country every day with his her-
oism and his service to others. The way
he lived his life and the way he give his
life is a language that is clear to one
and all.
It is with a heavy heart that I, along
with the entire First State—that is the
State of Delaware—and the people of
this country, offer our sincere condo-
lences to Chris’s wife, Shannon, and
their three girls. Their dad is an Amer-
ican hero.
Our congressional delegation and our
Governor promise that he will not soon
be forgotten.
I know that his legacy lives on in his
daughters and in his wife Shannon.
A friend of mine was married to a
Navy SEAL a number of years ago.
That marriage produced a daughter
who is 18 years old and who will grad-
uate from high school later this month.
Her dad died of complications of PTSD.
He served in Iraq and Afghanistan, as I
recall. He later came down with ALS,
Lou Gehrig’s disease. He succumbed to
that about a year ago. Members of my
staff in Delaware—constituent service
staff—have worked for months trying
to make sure that his 18-year-old
daughter would be eligible for the ben-
efits of her Navy SEAL dad, now de-
ceased. We learned last month that she
will be eligible.
One of the things our congressional
delegation will work hard to do is to
make sure that to the extent that
Chris Slutman was eligible for the GI
bill—and our guess is that he was—
those benefits, under the law, if not
used by the veteran, by the soldier, by
the sailor, or by the airman, could be
used by the spouse, and if not used by
the spouse, could be used by a depend-
ent child.
There are three dependent children
here—three daughters who are beau-
tiful girls, who anyone would be proud
to claim as their own child, grandchild,
or niece. We are going to work hard to
make sure that those GI bill benefits—
if there is any way to do this legally—
accrue to Chris and Shannon and Shan-
non’s three daughters.
I, again, thank my friend Senator
PORTMAN for his kindness in yielding
tonight.
To Chris Slutman: God bless you,
Chris.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Ohio.
ECONOMIC GROWTH
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, first,
I say thanks to my colleague from
Delaware for the touching tribute to
Chris and his service in the U.S. Navy.
I am here to talk about our economy,
what is going on out there, and how we
can do a better job of bringing people
off the sidelines and into work. They
are needed.
Right now we have an incredibly
strong economy. We just learned in the
first quarter of this year that the econ-
omy grew by 3.2 percent. That is strong
and way above expectations. In fact,
when you look at the expectations that
were set by the Congressional Budget
Office, which is a nonpartisan group
that analyzes what is going to happen
in the economy going forward, prior to
the tax bill being signed into law—that
is, the tax reform and tax cuts from
the end of 2017—they said this first
quarter growth would be 1.6 percent. It
is interesting. It was exactly twice the
economic growth than was projected
before the tax bill.
By the way, before the tax bill, they
also made a projection on jobs. Over
the last year, we have produced just
about exactly twice as many jobs—a
little more than that—than was pro-
jected. The tax cuts and the tax reform
have worked, along with regulatory re-
lief, to give this economy a shot in the
arm. That is so important.
I will say that when you look at what
happened in the first quarter of this
year, the 3.2 percent is great, but it
would have been even better had we
not shut down the government. I say
that because we have some new num-
bers from the Congressional Budget Of-
fice that say that the level of GDP this
first quarter would have been 0.2 per-
cent more if we had not had the gov-
ernment shutdown late last year,
which was the longest government
shutdown in the history of our country.
So it would have been 3.6 percent in-
stead of 3.2 percent. Wow, that would
be terrific. I guess I bring that up only
because I think it is time for us, again,
to prepare for the potential of our hav-
ing another impasse year at the end of
this fiscal year on September 30. I hope
we will avoid going into another gov-
ernment shutdown. It just doesn’t
make sense. It is shooting ourselves in
the foot.
There is legislation called the End
Government Shutdowns Act. Almost
all of my colleagues on this side of the
aisle have now sponsored that legisla-
tion. It just avoids our going into a
shutdown but still allows us to con-
tinue to move forward on our spending
and, over time, reduce that spending
until we get our act together and do
the appropriations bills here. Again,
there is good news in terms of job
growth in the first quarter.
The other thing I think is really im-
portant and may be the most impor-
tant statistic of all is the fact that
wages are going up for the first time in
a decade. Really, in Ohio, for a decade
and a half, we have had flat wages—
higher expenses but flat wages. It is
really frustrating to the families who
are working hard and doing everything
right but can’t get ahead. Over the last
year now, we have seen wage increases.
A 3.4-percent wage increase is the
strongest we have seen since the great
recession. I love the fact that this wage
growth is happening not just among
higher paid individuals but, actually,
primarily among what is called non-
supervisory employees. That is how the
Department of Labor terms it. These
are blue-collar jobs. These are middle-
class jobs. These are jobs of people
who, again, have had a tough time
making ends meet. I know in my State
most people work paycheck to pay-
check, and it is great to have that
higher wage come in.
We passed tax reform because we be-
lieved it is the right thing to do for our
economy, for employers, for invest-
ment, and we have seen that positive
impact. I have had over two dozen
townhall meetings and roundtable dis-
cussions in my State, talking to em-
ployers, usually smaller businesses,
about what happened to them with re-
gard to tax reform. Every single one of
them said the same thing: We have re-
invested in the business. We have in-
vested in technology, in new equip-
ment, and we have invested in our peo-
ple. In some cases, that means better
benefits. In two cases, small businesses
acknowledged to me that they weren’t
providing healthcare before the tax
cuts, and now they are because of the
savings from the tax cut. They have
also invested in people’s 401(k)s and
other benefits. That is what is hap-
pening out there in terms of the busi-
ness side of the tax reform and tax
cuts.
In addition to that, there are also a
lot of Americans who now have more of
their hard-earned money coming home.
Their paychecks are better because of
the middle-class tax cuts that are in
the legislation. For Ohio, this amount-
ed to $2,000 per year, on average, for a
median-income family. I know there
has been a lot of discussion by others
saying: Well, really, these tax cuts
didn’t happen. Yes, they did. They did.
That is a fact. Most people I represent
have seen a tax cut, and a lot of those
individuals saw their overall tax liabil-
ity go down—not just that the monthly
checks were better, but on April 15
they had better news. Let me give you
some facts about that.
According to H&R Block, which is
probably the firm that handles more
middle-class tax returns than any
other firm in the country, the average
Ohioan saw a 23.3-percent decrease in
their overall tax bill in 2018. This is
from H&R Block. They also said that
there is a 2.3-percent increase in the
average refund in Ohio. I know there
has been a lot of discussion about this
back and forth, and early on people
were concerned about their refunds.
These are the numbers. These are the
facts from H&R Block. Overall, about
90 percent of middle-class Americans
received a tax cut in 2018, which means
more money in their pockets to pay
down student debt, to save for retire-
ment, to take a long-awaited family
vacation, and to be able to, again,
achieve whatever their dream is in life.
The economy is growing, creating
jobs, and wages are rising. That is all

good news. But with more jobs there is
a problem that has developed, and that
is a lack of workers. I can’t go any-
where in Ohio—and I just had a bunch
of meetings in Ohio, talking about
this—where people don’t tell me: We
don’t have enough qualified workers to
fill the jobs that we have. Some people
call it the skills gap, and that is true
in Ohio. We have a mismatch between
the skills that are out there—the skills
that people who are looking for jobs
have—and the jobs that are available.
If you go on the OhioMeansJobs
website right now, you will see about
145,000 jobs being offered. When you
look at them, these are good jobs. A lot
of them, though, require a certain level
of skill. Some are information tech-
nology jobs, coding jobs. Some are
skilled manufacturing jobs, like ma-
chining or welding. Some of the jobs
are in bioscience, healthcare jobs, tech-
nicians. The problem is we don’t have
the people who have the skills to fill
those jobs. That is a shame for those
individuals who aren’t achieving their
hopes in life because they aren’t get-
ting those good jobs and certainly for
our economy, which would be even
stronger if we had more people to fill
those jobs.
According to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics at the Department of Labor,
7.3 million U.S. jobs are currently va-
cant, again, largely because of the
shortage of qualified workers. The Na-
tional Skills Coalition estimates that
nearly half of all job openings between
now and 2022 will be what they call
middle-skill jobs. This means jobs that
require education beyond high school,
like a certificate program, but not a 4-
year degree. The supply of skilled
workers in this category—students
pursuing post high school certifi-
cations—still falls way short of what
the industry demand is.
This is why career and technical edu-
cation is important. CTE is part of the
answer to this. If you are in high
school and looking for an opportunity,
check out your career and technical
academy. In many high schools, it is
combined in one CTE program. It is a
great opportunity. It will give you the
knowledge and training necessary to
succeed in your career.
I am the cofounder and the cochair of
what is called the Senate CTE Caucus.
We have been working to raise aware-
ness of this issue, so many of my col-
leagues have now joined this caucus be-
cause they go home and see the same
thing. How do we connect our hard-
working Ohioans to good-paying jobs,
and how do we strengthen these CTE
programs to make them more afford-
able and more accessible?
One answer is legislation recently re-
introduced by Senator TIM KAINE and
me. It is called the JOBS Act. It is
really very simple. It says we should be
allowed to use Pell grants not just to
pay for college but to pay for shorter
term certificate programs. These have
to be qualified programs, programs
that provide real credentials to people.
Right now, with the Pell grant, if it is
a program of less than 15 weeks, you
can’t use it. So low-income students all
over the country are told: You can go
to college. That is great. We are going
to encourage you to do that,
incentivize you to do that, but you
can’t get this short-term training pro-
gram that can get you the job right
away.
In Ohio, if those students graduate—
and most don’t—their average debt is
$27,000 compared, again, to the oppor-
tunity to go through the short-term
training program, get the job, and
begin to make money to buy the car, to
be able to buy a small home or at least
to rent an apartment and not be in
your parents’ basement, and to be able
to move ahead with your life and your
family. So career and technical edu-
cation is a great opportunity, and the
JOBS Act would make it much more
likely that people would take that op-
portunity.
By the way, the community colleges
around the country love the JOBS Act.
I believe it is their top priority this
year. Why? Because so many of them
are now offering these certificate-based
programs because they are responding
to the needs of the community and
what the businesses are telling them
they need.
It is going to be different in every
community, by the way, and that is
good. There is no ‘‘one size fits all.’’ In
some communities in Ohio, because we
are a big manufacturing State, it is
welding, and it is machining. In other
places around the country, it might be
something else. It might be for the
fishing industry, the oil and gas indus-
try, or bioscience. All across Ohio I
have seen how these programs are
working and could work even better if
we had the JOBS Act.
Last week I toured Venture Prod-
ucts. It is a family-owned company
that designs and makes tractors. They
make an incredible product called the
Ventrac. They have a really impressive
facility, and it was great to see them
and their success. The company has
benefited from tax reform and has
made additional investments in its
business and its workers with their tax
savings, just like all of these compa-
nies that I have gone to visit all over
our State.
After the tour of the company, we
had a roundtable discussion. It was
with educators—people from the local
community college and career and
technical education folks who came
in—also business people and people
from the area who were involved in
economic development because they
are very concerned that without the
workforce they can’t expand the busi-
nesses in this community in Ohio. We
talked about the need to strengthen
CTE programs, and we talked about
the JOBS Act. All of them agreed that
this would be really helpful and helpful
right now.
I also had a visit at the Central Ohio
Technical College. The investiture
ceremony took place last Thursday,
and I had the chance to meet the new
president, Dr. John Berry. There are a
lot of exciting things happening at this
career and technical college.
They work pretty closely with Ohio
State, which is terrific. So you have
Ohio State, a 4-year college, and a
great series of graduate programs,
working directly with these commu-
nity colleges that focus on skills train-
ing. They are expanding their program-
ming, which will help to meet the
needs of today’s workforce. The JOBS
Act, according to them, will greatly
benefit the students who are using
these shorter term programs to put
them on a path to a good-paying job.
In Walnut Creek, OH, I spoke at the
Eastern Ohio Development Alliance’s
annual meeting in Hockley County.
This meeting represented counties
from all over eastern and southeastern
Ohio. We talked about a lot of things,
including the shortage of skilled work-
ers, because it comes up again and
again. In this case, Ohio has this won-
derful opportunity with the Marcellus
and the Utica Shale finds to develop
our natural gas and our wet gas and
our oil industry, but they need work-
ers. We don’t want to have workers
coming in from out of State, frankly.
We want to develop our own Ohio
workforce, and we can only do that
with skills training because a lot of
these jobs require skills that are not
available in Ohio today.
In Columbus, last week I spoke at a
reentry conference. This is an annual
conference talking about how to get
people going from prison into our com-
munities with the job skills they need
and the mental health and drug treat-
ment they need to be successful. Again,
it all came down to this issue of work-
force training being so important, both
because it helps people to get a job and
not go back into the prison system and
also because getting a job is an essen-
tial part of so many successful recov-
ery programs for people who have drug
and alcohol addiction and want to be
able to participate in our economy.
This gives them meaning and purpose
in life and helps with their recovery.
I was in Knox County at a roundtable
discussion. Again, in this case, it was
with first responders, local elected offi-
cials, and the leadership of their men-
tal health and recovery organization
there. Their board there is focused on
dealing with the crystal meth problem.
It has almost pushed the opioid prob-
lem to the second most troubling drug
problem in the community. They still
have overdoses from opioids. They are
still concerned about that. Crystal
meth has now come in with a venge-
ance—pure crystal meth from Mexico.
Their big issue is how to get people in
recovery and successful recovery.
Again, the issue of job training came
up. How do you give people the skills
they need to get a job, and how do you
incorporate job skills in a recovery
program, again, so people have a rea-
son to turn their life around to get

back with their family. That purpose
and meaning come from a job, so often.
So it was an opportunity to talk
about the need for us to develop the
workforce to meet the needs of our
communities and the opportunity to
talk about the need for the JOBS Act.
I am really pleased that the JOBS Act
is in the President’s budget this year. I
thank President Trump and his admin-
istration for including that. It makes
all the sense in the world. The higher
education bill will be reauthorized this
year, we all hope. That is certainly the
plan. If that happens, it is the perfect
place for having the JOBS Act in-
cluded.
Senator KAINE of Virginia and I are
the coauthors of this legislation. We
are hopeful that our colleagues on both
sides of the aisle will join us in this
legislation and help us to get it in the
Higher Education Act. I know that it is
a priority of many members of that
committee, and Chairman ALEXANDER,
in particular, has a passion for ensur-
ing that we have the training we need
out there to get people the jobs to let
them achieve their dreams in life.
Passing the JOBS Act will give us an
opportunity to help so many Ameri-
cans have better opportunities, and,
just as importantly, it would enable us
to help our economy right now because
the biggest concern I hear is no longer
the taxes. People love the tax cuts and
tax reform, and they love the regu-
latory relief, but they are looking for
skilled workers. This is an oppor-
tunity. Let’s seize it. Let’s keep grow-
ing our economy and help Americans
fulfill their God-given potential.
I yield the floor.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Nebraska.
HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES
SPECIALIST BLAKE KELLY
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise
today to continue my tribute to Ne-
braska heroes—the men and women
who have given their lives defending
our freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Each of these Nebraskans has a power-
ful story to tell.
Today I will reflect upon the life of
Nebraska Army National Guard SPC
Blake Kelly. Blake was a typical
smalltown Nebraska boy. Born and
raised in Shelby, NE, which has a popu-
lation of just over 700, Blake lived next
to the city park. His parents, Randy
and Patty, have lived in the same
house for 44 years.
Blake’s early life was filled with
football, track, lifeguarding at the
local swimming pool in the summer,
band major duties, and playing the
drums. In fact, he met his future wife,
Christina, at band practice in 1997. He
loved to play the drums, and the neigh-
borhood, well, always knew when he
was practicing.
When he was old enough to cruise
around Shelby, his dad, Randy, bought
him a 1976 Dodge Charger. Every
smalltown Nebraska boy needs a car.
Blake knew everyone around town and
everyone knew him. He was always
happy and eager to help someone solve
a problem.
In high school, one of his teachers en-
couraged him to join the National
Guard. For Blake, this was an oppor-
tunity to spread his wings and go to
college using the Guard’s tuition as-
sistance program.
In 2000, between his junior and senior
years in high school, he went through
Army basic training at Fort Jackson,
SC. Before graduation in 2001, he asked
Christina to marry him. After becom-
ing engaged and graduating from high
school, Blake attended advanced train-
ing at Fort Knox, in Kentucky, that in-
cluded Ranger training. He returned
home in September 2001 just as life in
the United States was changing forever
following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
Shortly after, Blake enrolled at
Southeast Community College in Bea-
trice to study animal science. There he
became interested in rodeo and joined
the school’s rodeo team. The year 2002
was a busy one for Blake, filled with
school, National Guard training with
the 1st Squadron, 167th Cavalry, known
as the Cav, and wedding planning. He
and Christina tied the knot on Sep-
tember 7, 2002, just as the Cav was pre-
paring to deploy to Bosnia.
At that time, early Active-Duty
Army resources were devoted to fight-
ing in Afghanistan and Iraq, but the
United States still had significant
commitments to peacekeeping oper-
ations in the Balkans. The Cav’s mis-
sion was an ideal one for the National
Guard and a critical element in our na-
tional security.
The Cav arrived in Bosnia in January
2003, and just before Blake left Ne-
braska with the unit, Christina learned
that she was pregnant. In Bosnia,
Blake delved into the mission at hand.
He was always ready and eager to
serve, and he connected well with the
local population. Unit chaplains needed
help, and so he embraced his Catholic
faith even more deeply by becoming a
Eucharistic minister and actively sup-
porting chapel programs.
On July 29, 2003, Blake was killed in
an accident involving his convoy and a
local vehicle. The loss of Blake was the
first casualty of a deployed Nebraska
Army National Guard member in over
a decade. His community and the en-
tire State were shocked.
He was buried at St. Mary’s Catholic
Church in rural Nebraska on August 6,
2003. The entire town turned out for the
funeral, as did freedom riders from
throughout Nebraska. Blake’s son
Simon was born in September 2003, the
month the Cav returned home from
their deployment.
Today, Simon is a freshman in high
school, and Christina maintains a tight
relationship with Blake’s family.
Randy and Patty, his parents, still live
in the same house in Shelby.
In 2014, the town of Shelby dedicated
a veterans’ memorial, and Blake’s fam-
ily played a prominent role in the dedi-
cation ceremony. Blake’s spirit lives
on, and he is remembered in so many
ways.
SPC Blake Kelly embodied the pride
of his small town and his State. He
served his country with distinction,
and he loved his family. I am honored
to tell his story.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
YEMEN
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I
rise today to speak about a true hu-
manitarian crisis. This is a crisis that
is close to my heart, and that is be-
cause it is close to the hearts of so
many wonderful people in the State of
Michigan.
Michigan is home to a large and wel-
coming Yemeni American commu-
nity—one of the Nation’s largest—and
we are so proud and happy that they
are part of our community. Right now
these Michigan residents are horrified
to watch what is happening to a coun-
try where many of them have family
members and friends.
More than 4 years ago, war broke out
in Yemen. Imagine 4 years of going to
bed every night, wondering if this will
be the night that a bomb or rocket will
hit your home and destroy everything
you have, including your family; 4
years of being unable to send your chil-
dren to school because it is simply not
safe for them to be outside; 4 years of
deadly disease outbreaks with little ac-
cess to medical care or even safe drink-
ing water; perhaps worst of all, 4 years
of sending your children to bed hungry
every night because there is simply not
enough food.
It is bad enough to think about being
a parent under those circumstances.
Imagine what it is like to be a child.
You are 4 years old. You don’t under-
stand what is going on. You just know
that you can’t go outside, you can’t
sleep at night, and you are hungry all
the time. There are 4-year-olds in
Yemen today who have never lived in a
country that wasn’t at war.
Sadly, there are 4-year-olds in Yemen
today who will never see their fifth
birthday. About 1.2 million children
are living in active conflict zones,
meaning that a stray bullet or rocket
could end their life at any moment. It
is estimated that a child in Yemen dies
every 10 minutes—the length of my
speaking today on the floor, every 10
minutes—from a lack of food or dis-
eases that can be prevented with ade-
quate medical care, including vaccina-
tions.
Overall, the United Nations esti-
mates that no matter what we do at
this moment—no matter what we do—
250,000 Yemeni people will die within
the next year due to malnutrition, de-
hydration, and by diseases like cholera.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2561
May 1, 2019
That is astounding and horrible—
250,000 people in addition to the esti-
mated 60,000 people whose lives have
been cut short due to bombings and vi-
olence.
If you are having trouble picturing
250,000 people, it is as if a fully loaded
jumbo jet crashed every day for a year
and then kept crashing, one per day,
until late August.
If these dire circumstances don’t
change soon, that number could reach
10 million people by this time next
year—10 million people. It is astound-
ing. We should all feel a sense of ur-
gency about the United States playing
a positive, not a negative, role in stop-
ping this.
I want to say again that 10 million
people could die from a combination of
famine, dehydration, and disease. That
is like the entire populations of New
York City and San Antonio being
wiped off the map.
We simply cannot sit by and let this
humanitarian disaster continue. I was
pleased back in March when the Senate
passed the bipartisan resolution to di-
rect the U.S. Armed Forces be removed
from hostilities in Yemen. I have sup-
ported this resolution since the very
beginning, the first time it was on the
floor. It has been gaining momentum,
gaining more and more support from
the Senate, and I am thankful that it
finally got to the Senate.
Unfortunately, the administration
chose to veto the resolution and allow
the suffering to continue.
Taking action to end this suffering is
more than just the right thing to do; it
is our moral obligation as fellow
human beings. That is why I am calling
on all of the Members in the Chamber,
all of the Members in the Senate to
stand together to override the veto and
end the U.S. support for this conflict.
We need a clear strategy on how to
take an active role in deescalating the
conflict and addressing the accom-
panying humanitarian crisis.
We should be leading the inter-
national response—leading the inter-
national response and working with
international partners to find a solu-
tion, not contributing to the problem.
We should be supporting peace talks
that involve all parties, all of which
are contributing to this horrible, hor-
rible humanitarian crisis.
We know who not to blame for all of
this—those scared and hungry 4-year-
olds who have spent every day of their
lives just trying to stay alive. Can you
imagine how their parents are feeling
about this situation that their children
are in as well?
Ending this conflict and humani-
tarian crisis is where we should be fo-
cusing our policies and our political
might.
I will be voting to override this Pres-
idential veto, and I encourage every
Member of the Chamber to join me—
join us, together, in doing the right
thing. It is time to do the right thing
for those 4-year-olds, for all of the peo-
ple in Yemen who just want to be able
to feed their families, send their chil-
dren to school, have a safe home, and
be able to carry on with their lives.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I

ate resume legislative session and be in

ators permitted to speak therein for up
to 10 minutes each.

pore. Without objection, it is so or-

REMEMBERING DOMINIC DIFRISCO
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in 1962,
the airline Alitalia sent a young man
named Dominic DiFrisco to Chicago to
help with publicity for its inaugural
flight between the city and Rome.
What was a temporary assignment be-
came a life decision for my friend
Dominic. He found a home in Chicago
and, in the decades following, became a
champion for Chicago’s Italian commu-
nity.
On Sunday, he passed away at the
age of 85 after a life of celebration, sto-
ries, and love. There are so many sto-
ries of Dominic helping people that
they are too numerous to count here. If
you grew up in Chicago, you knew
Dominic.
For decades, Dominic was the most
recognized and vocal supporter of
Italian Americans. Dominic was born
in 1933 in the Bronx of New York City
to Leoluca and Antonina, immigrants
from Sicily. He graduated from Ford-
ham University in 1955 and began his
career in public relations. His career
was defined by building bridges be-
tween the public and private sectors.
His color commentary, with his vast
knowledge of Chicago-Italian history,
was a staple during the broadcast of
Columbus Day parades. He helped
make sure other ethnic groups and
Jewish Holocaust victims had roles in
the Chicago Columbus Day parade. He
was a man of stories. He always had
one for any situation, and Columbus
Day will not be the same without him.
If you travel a few blocks north of
Taylor Street’s Little Italy in Chicago,
you will find Our Lady of Pompeii, the
oldest surviving Italian-American
Catholic Church in Chicago. It has been
an anchor to the community since 1910,
but in 1993, the archdiocese announced
it would close Our Lady of Pompeii.
That didn’t sit well with the locals, es-
pecially Dominic. He joined the effort
to resurrect the church, which con-
tinues to serve the community today.
Our Lady of Pompeii calls him a found-
ing father.
Dominic was president emeritus of
the Joint Civic Committee of Italian
Americans, and he created and hosted
the annual Dante Awards. More than 40
journalists have won Dante Awards for
their work answering Dante Alighieri’s
call to be ‘‘no timid friend to truth.’’
Dominic was no timid friend to anyone
he knew.
Dominic was a great friend. He was
always helping people whether it was a
smile, a kind word, or his latest rec-
ommendation for an Italian restaurant.
His stories were legendary, but his
whole life was an extraordinary story.
A few years ago, Dominic accepted my
invitation to attend a joint session of
Congress featuring the Prime Minister
of Italy. It is fair to say that many of
those in the Capitol that day were as
impressed with Dominic’s passion for
life, his stories, and his hopefulness for
the U.S.-Italian relationship as the
speech itself.
In a Chicago restaurant called Gene
and Georgetti’s, there is a table that
was Dominic’s. It was his court, and
now, sadly, it is quiet. To his wife
Carol and the DiFrisco family, Loretta
and I send our sincere condolences.
f
CHOOSE MEDICARE ACT
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I
rise in support of the Choose Medicare
Act, which would strengthen the Af-
fordable Care Act and help reduce
healthcare costs for all Americans.
This commonsense bill would create
a public healthcare option based on
Medicare that would increase choice
and competition in the Affordable Care
Act marketplaces, including Califor-
nia’s state exchange, Covered Cali-
fornia.
I would also allow the Secretary of
Health Human Services to negotiate
drug prices under Medicare, increase
healthcare subsidies for middle-income
Americans, and allow the federal gov-
ernment to block unreasonable health
insurance rate increases.
The majority of Americans support
expanding healthcare choices to
achieve universal coverage and lower
costs for everyone. However, too many
Americans are still unable to afford a
private plan that covers the care they
need. The Choose Medicare Act would
fix this by creating a public health in-
surance plan that would compete
alongside private insurers in the indi-
vidual and group insurance market-
places.
Known as Medicare Part E, the pub-
lic option health plan would offer com-
prehensive coverage and all of the ben-
efits covered under traditional Medi-
care. Every doctor that accepts tradi-
tional Medicare would also be enrolled
as a provider for the public health plan,

giving patients access to a large net-
work of doctors across the country. It
would also benefit employers. Around
half of Californians receive their
health insurance through their work.
The Choose Medicare Act would give
them more options, allowing large em-
ployers to choose a plan modeled on
traditional Medicare for their workers.
Just as they do now, employers would
cover a portion of the cost of their em-
ployees’ coverage.
Having access to this new public op-
tion would increase competition and
choice in the employer market, and the
public plan’s negotiating power would
help reduce health costs for employers,
not just individuals. Moreover, our bill
would ensure that people who receive
their health coverage through the pub-
lic option would be able to keep their
health insurance when they change em-
ployers. Americans would no longer
feel stuck in low-paying jobs because
they are worried about losing their
health insurance.
The Choose Medicare Act would also
provide funding for a new reinsurance
program to partially offset the high
healthcare costs paid by insurers for
the sickest individuals. This reinsur-
ance program would improve insurer
participation in the Affordable Care
Act exchanges and lower premiums for
everyone. It would also give States the
option to use this funding to address
high out of-pocket costs, such as co-
payments, coinsurance, premiums, and
deductibles.
I am proud to note that this bill in-
cludes rate review legislation I have
previously introduced to help keep in-
surance premiums down. Rather than
allowing American workers to suffer
under excessive premium increases, our
bill would give the Secretary of Health
and Human Services the authority to
review, modify, and reject unjustified
premium increases in States where the
insurance commissioner does not have
that authority.
This review process has already been
successful in States where it was im-
plemented. Our bill would ensure that
everyone, regardless of where they live,
is protected from unreasonable pre-
miums increases.
The rising cost of drug pricing is also
a huge problem in our healthcare sys-
tem. Our bill would give the Secretary
of Health and Human Services the au-
thority to negotiate lower drug prices
with manufacturers, reducing the
amount patients pay at the pharmacy.
After 1 year of negotiations, if the
Secretary and drug manufacturers are
unable to agree on a fair price, the Sec-
retary will then be able to use the price
that the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs or other Federal agencies that
purchase prescription drugs already
use.
Finally, our bill would protect Amer-
ica’s seniors enrolled in traditional
Medicare from unlimited out-of-pocket
costs by adding an annual out-of-pock-
et maximum for what they can pay.
Seniors would no longer be burdened
with mounting medical costs because
they are enrolled in Medicare instead
of private insurance.
I want to thank Senator MERKLEY
and Senator MURPHY for leading our ef-
forts on this important legislation. I
urge my colleagues to join us in sup-
porting this much-needed, common-
sense bill to strengthen the Affordable
Care Act, give consumers more choices
when picking their healthcare plan,
and make healthcare more affordable
for all.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY
COMMISSION BUDGET REQUEST
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that a copy of
my opening statement at the Senate
Appropriations Subcommittee on En-
ergy and Water Development be print-
ed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION BUDGET
REQUEST
Mr. ALEXANDER. We run a real risk of
losing our best source of carbon-free power
just at a time when most Americans are in-
creasingly worried about climate change.
Nuclear power must be part of our energy fu-
ture if we want clean, cheap, and reliable en-
ergy that can create good jobs and keep
America competitive in a global economy.
Today 98 nuclear reactors provide about 20
percent of electricity in the United States,
and 60 percent of all carbon-free electricity
in the United States. But nuclear plants are
closing because they cost too much to build
and cannot compete with natural gas. Two
reactors have announced they will retire
later this year, and ten more have an-
nounced retirements by 2025.
Let’s do a little math here. If we closed
those 12 reactors, that would mean a 17 per-
cent decline in carbon-free nuclear power by
2025, which is 10 percent of carbon-free elec-
tricity. Today, solar power—despite impres-
sive reductions in cost—provides 4 percent
and wind provides 20 percent of carbon-free
electricity despite billions of dollars in sub-
sidies. To replace those 12 reactors that have
announced they will close with other carbon-
free electricity, we would have to almost tri-
ple the entirety of U.S. solar power or in-
crease wind power by another 50 percent. If
half of our existing nuclear reactors were to
close, we would have to double the amount of
wind energy produced and or increase the
amount of solar energy produced by as much
as 10 times.
Nuclear power is much more reliable than
solar or wind power. It is available when the
sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow.
The bottom line is, we can’t replace nuclear
power with just wind and solar. We would
have to use natural gas to replace nuclear
power, which would increase emissions in
our country.
Unfortunately, we do not need to speculate
about what happens when a major industri-
alized country eliminates nuclear power. We
have seen what happened in Japan and Ger-
many for different reasons. Major industri-
alized economies similar to ours lost their
emission-free, low-cost, reliable electricity.
Prices went up, pollution went up, and man-
ufacturing became less competitive in the
global marketplace. And that is where we
are headed in the next 10 years if we do not
do something. Stakes are high.
In Japan, the cost of generating electricity
increased 56 percent after the Fukushima ac-
cident in 2011 when Japan went from obtain-
ing 30 percent of its power from nuclear to
less than 2 percent.
Before 2011, Germany obtained one quarter
of its electricity from nuclear. Now that
number is down to 12 percent. Now Germany
has among the highest household electricity
rates in the European Union after replacing
nuclear power with wind and solar as part of
an expensive cap-and-trade policy. Germany
also had to build new coal plants to meet de-
mand, which increased emissions.
In late March, I proposed that the United
States should launch a New Manhattan
Project for Clean Energy, a five-year project
with Ten Grand Challenges that will use
American research and technology to put
our country and the world firmly on a path
toward cleaner, cheaper energy.
These Grand Challenges call for break-
throughs in advanced nuclear reactors, nat-
ural gas, carbon capture, better batteries,
greener buildings, electric vehicles, cheaper
solar, and fusion.
I put advanced reactors first on the list for
a reason. To make sure nuclear power has a
future in this country, we need to develop
advanced reactors that have the potential to
be smaller, cost less, produce less waste, and
be safer than today’s reactors.
We need to stop talking about advanced re-
actors and actually build something. Within
the next five years, we need to build one or
more advanced reactors to demonstrate the
capabilities they may bring.
As we review the Nuclear Regulatory Com-
mission’s fiscal year 2020 budget request we
need to make sure the Commission has the
staff and resources it needs to respond to the
changing industry.
First, I would like to thank our witnesses
for being here today, and also Senator FEIN-
STEIN, with whom I have the pleasure to
work again this year to draft the Energy and
Water Appropriations bill. Our witnesses
today include: Kristine Svinicki, Chairman
of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; Com-
missioner Jeff Baran; Commissioner Annie
Caputo; and Commissioner David Wright.
Commissioner Stephen Burns retired yes-
terday after forty years of distinguished
service at the NRC. He started as an attor-
ney in 1978, rose to General Counsel, and
then retired from the agency to head Legal
Affairs at the Nuclear Energy Agency in
Paris. He returned to the NRC in 2014 as a
Commissioner and Chairman. He was well re-
spected in every position he held. I would
like to thank him for his many years of serv-
ice.
We’re here today to review the administra-
tion’s fiscal year 2020 budget request for the
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the
independent federal agency responsible for
regulating the safety of our nation’s 98 com-
mercial nuclear power plants and other civil-
ian uses of nuclear material.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s
budget request this fiscal year is $921 mil-
lion, which is about $10 million less than
Congress provided last year. The request in-
cludes $38.5 million for the Yucca Mountain
licensing process.
It has become increasingly difficult for the
nuclear industry to compete with other
sources of electricity, especially natural gas.
One of the concerns the industry had was the
amount of regulatory fees charged by the
Commission—currently, $760 million of the
Commission’s budget comes from fees paid
by utilities and other facilities that are li-
censed to possess and use nuclear materials.
So over the last five fiscal years, we have
worked with the Commission to reduce its
overall budget by about $100 million, which
represents about a 10 percent reduction in
budget—which means a roughly 10 percent
reduction in fees—and more closely reflects
its actual workload while maintaining its
gold standard of safety.
These savings are important because they
lower the fees utilities must pay the Com-
mission, and these savings can be passed on
to utilities’ customers. These reductions
have not been arbitrary and represent the
type of oversight the Senate is supposed to
do. Our subcommittee has only reduced the
Commission’s budget in areas that the Com-
mission has identified as unnecessary to its
important safety mission.
To ensure nuclear power will continue to
play a significant role in our nation’s elec-
tricity generation, I’d like to focus my re-
marks on four main areas:
(1) Licensing small modular and advanced
reactors;
(2) Solving the nuclear waste stalemate;
(3) Safely extending licenses for existing
reactors; and
(4) Maintaining adequate staffing at the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Advanced reactors and small modular reac-
tors represent the future of nuclear power.
The Commission needs to be ready to review
applications for new these new reactors. In
fiscal year 2017, we provided enough funding
to complete the Small Modular Reactor Li-
censing Technical Support program at the
Department of Energy. NuScale, which was
one of the technologies selected in that pro-
gram, filed an application for design certifi-
cation of a small modular reactor with the
Commission in December of 2016. A utility
group has been working with NuScale and
Idaho National Laboratory to build and dem-
onstrate a small modular reactor in Idaho.
TVA also has an application under review for
a permit to build and demonstrate a small
modular reactor at the Clinch River site in
Tennessee.
Licenses to build and demonstrate small
modular reactors is an important step, and
we need to make sure the Commission has
the resources it needs to review the applica-
tions. I also understand that the Commission
expects to receive an application in fiscal
year 2020 for a construction and operating li-
cense for an advanced, non-light water reac-
tor.
The fiscal year 2019 appropriations bill in-
cluded $10 million for the Commission to pre-
pare to review advanced reactor designs, and
the current budget request includes $15.5
million for fiscal year 2020. I’d like to know
what the Commission plans to do with the
funding Congress provided for advanced reac-
tors so that we can make sure the develop-
ment of advanced reactors stays on track.
To ensure that nuclear power has a strong
future in this country, we must solve the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2565

decades’ long stalemate over what to do with
used fuel from our nuclear reactors. Senator
FEINSTEIN and I have been working on solv-
ing the nuclear waste stalemate for years,
and I’d like to take the opportunity to com-
pliment Senator Feinstein on her leadership
and her insistence that we find a solution to
this problem. The only way to break the
stalemate is to get a final decision on wheth-
er Yucca Mountain is safe or not.
And this year’s budget request for the Nu-
clear Regulatory Commission includes $38.5
million to begin to answer that questions by
restarting the licensing process for the
Yucca Mountain repository. This is the next
step the Department of Energy must follow
to determine whether it can begin construc-
tion of Yucca Mountain. After a public hear-
ing where all parties, including the State of
Nevada, can provide expert testimony and
evidence, the Commission will make a final
determination whether it is safe to build
Yucca Mountain.
I strongly believe that Yucca Mountain
can and should be part of the solution to the
nuclear waste stalemate. Federal law des-
ignates Yucca Mountain as the nation’s re-
pository for used nuclear fuel, and the Com-
mission’s own scientists have told us that we
can safely store nuclear waste there for up to
one million years.
But even if we had Yucca Mountain open
today, we would still need to look for an-
other permanent repository. We already have
more than enough used fuel to fill Yucca
Mountain to its legal capacity.
The quickest, and probably the least ex-
pensive, way for the federal government to
start to meet its used nuclear fuel obliga-
tions is for the Department of Energy to con-
tract with a private storage facility for used
nuclear fuel.
I understand that two private companies
have submitted license applications to the
NRC for private consolidated storage facili-
ties, one in Texas and one in New Mexico,
and that the NRC’s review is well underway.
I’ll be asking some questions about that
today. I want to make sure that the Commis-
sion has all the resources it needs in fiscal
year 2020 to review the applications for con-
solidated storage facilities because we have
to start working together to solve the nu-
clear waste stalemate if we want a strong
nuclear industry.
Senator MURKOWSKI, along with Senator
FEINSTEIN and I, introduced a bill this week
to implement the recommendations of the
Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nu-
clear Future, which include using temporary
private storage facilities. The legislation
complements Yucca Mountain, and would
create a new federal agency to find addi-
tional permanent repositories and temporary
facilities for used nuclear fuel.
Instead of building more windmills, which
only produce 20 percent of our carbon-free
electricity, or solar farms, which only
produce 4 percent of our carbon-free elec-
tricity, the best way to make sure the
United States has a reliable source of inex-
pensive, efficient, carbon-free electricity is
to extend the licenses of our existing nuclear
plants—which produce 60 percent of our car-
bon-free electricity—if it is safe to do so.
Most of our 98 reactors have already ex-
tended their operating licenses from 40 to 60
years (although many have decided to close
prematurely for economic reasons), and
some utilities are beginning the process to
extend their licenses from 60 to 80 years.
The Commission has spent the past several
years developing the framework to review
these types of license renewal applications to
make sure the reactors can continue to oper-
ate safely from 60 to 80 years.
This year’s budget request includes fund-
ing to review what the Commission calls
‘‘subsequent’’ license renewal applications
for six reactors in Florida, Pennsylvania,
and Virginia. Just those 6 reactor extensions
would equal about what solar power cur-
rently produces and a fourth of what wind
power currently produces. That is just ac-
counting for the 6 reactors that have applied
to extend their licenses rather than shut
down. If even half of the remaining 92 reac-
tors decide to extend their licenses another
20 years, it would produce almost double the
amount of wind power that is currently pro-
duced and as much as 10 times the amount of
solar power produced.
So if you care about carbon free emissions,
the short term solution for the next 20 years
is, where safely, to extend the licenses for
these reactors. I want to make sure that the
Commission has the resources it needs to re-
view those applications in fiscal year 2020,
because I think it is important to maintain
our existing nuclear power when it is safe to
do so.
The Commission’s budget reduction has
been steep over the past five fiscal years. As
part of its effort to reduce its budget, the
Commission has limited hiring, especially
entry-level hiring. We have heard from the
Commission that of its 2,900 current employ-
ees, 24 percent are currently eligible for re-
tirement. Four years from now, 42 percent
will be eligible for retirement. Those num-
bers are not a concern as long as the NRC
has younger staff ready to take over the im-
portant work of the agency. But I under-
stand that only 2 percent of NRC employees
are under 30 years old. To have nuclear
power in the future, we need to have a nu-
clear regulator. I would like to understand
how the Commission is ensuring that the
next generation is in place.
I look forward to working with the Com-
mission as we begin putting together our En-
ergy and Water Appropriations bill for fiscal
year 2020, and also with Senator FEINSTEIN,
who I will now recognize for her opening
statement.

104TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE
ARMENIAN GENOCIDE
Mr. REED. Mr. President, on Sunday,
I had the opportunity to attend the
104th anniversary commemoration of
the Armenian genocide, hosted at the
Armenian Martyrs Memorial in Provi-
dence, RI. I was pleased to be able to
join with so many in the Armenian
community in my home State for this
solemn event.
Over a century ago, one of the great-
est tragedies of the 20th century began
when the Young Turk leaders of the
Ottoman Empire executed more than
200 prominent Armenians. What fol-
lowed was an 8-year campaign of op-
pression and massacre. By 1923, an esti-
mated 1 and a half million Armenians
were killed and over a half a million
survivors were exiled. These atrocities
affected the lives of every Armenian
living in Asia Minor and throughout
the world.
The U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman
Empire during this dark time, Henry
Morgenthau, Sr., unsuccessfully plead-
ed with President Wilson to take ac-
tion, and later remembered the events
of the genocide, saying, ‘‘I am con-
fident that the whole history of the
human race contains no such horrible
episode as this. The great massacres
and persecutions of the past seem al-
most insignificant when compared to
the sufferings of the Armenian race in
1915.’’
Those who survived the Armenian
genocide, however, persevered due to
their unbreakable spirit and steadfast
resolve, going on to greatly contribute
to the lands in which they established
new homes and communities, including
the United States. That is why we not
only commemorate this grave tragedy
each year, but also take the time to
celebrate the traditions, the contribu-
tions, and the bright future of the Ar-
menian people. Indeed, my home State
of Rhode Island continues to be en-
riched by our strong and vibrant Arme-
nian-American community.
To honor the memory of this trag-
edy, I have once again joined with sev-
eral of my colleagues on a resolution to
encourage the U.S. to officially recog-
nize the Armenian genocide. We must
find a way to come together to recog-
nize the truth of what happened and
support and assist those facing perse-
cution today.
As ranking member on the Senate
Armed Services Committee, I also re-
main committed to supporting assist-
ance to Armenia to strengthen secu-
rity, promote economic growth, and
foster democratic reforms and develop-
ment.
As we remember the past, we remain
committed to forging a brighter future.
We must continue to guard against ha-
tred and oppression so that we can pre-
vent such crimes against humanity
from happening again.

REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT
COLONEL DICK COLE
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am
here on the floor to talk about an
American hero.
General Douglas MacArthur once
said, ‘‘Duty, Honor, Country. Those
three hallowed words reverently dic-
tate what you ought to be, what you
can be, what you will be.’’ Those
words—duty, honor, country—are ex-
emplified through the life and legacy of
Lieutenant Colonel Richard Cole.
Lt. Col. Cole, who went by Dick, was
born and raised in my grandfather’s
hometown, Dayton, OH. He graduated
from Steele High School and completed
2 years of college at Ohio University
before enlisting in the Aviation Cadet
Program of the U.S. Army Air Corps in
November 1940. He commissioned as a
second lieutenant in July 1941 and re-
ceived his pilot wings at Randolph
Field in Texas. From there, he joined
the ranks of the 34th Bombardment
Squadron of the 17th Bombardment
Group.
Soon after, Lt. Col. Cole became one
of the 80 volunteers who signed up for
the Doolittle Mission, which was to be-
come the first offensive strike on
mainland Japan during World War II.
In a turn of fate, a Japanese vessel
spotted the USS Hornet, forcing the
mission to commence a day early.
Therefore, what was originally planned

as a 400–mile trip to mainland Japan
turned into a 645-mile journey to the
target, putting the pilots in grave dan-
ger because the planes did not have
enough fuel to reach their destination.
Lt. Col. Cole served valiantly as Lt.
Col. James Doolittle’s co-pilot, and to-
gether, they led the squadron of 16
Army Air Force bombers from the Hor-
net to Tokyo. The squadron succeeded
in bombing their target, but as pre-
dicted, his plane ran low on fuel and
they were forced to bail out over
China. His parachute worked, and he
landed in a tree, where he spent the
night and climbed down in the morn-
ing. He ultimately found some Chinese
students who took him to Doolittle.
After the raid, Cole went to India,
helped establish the dangerous Hump
flying route and flew more than 100
missions carrying cargo, earning three
Distinguished Flying Crosses. The Doo-
little Raiders received the Congres-
sional Gold Medal in 2015 and donated
it to the National Museum of the U.S.
Air Force in Ohio.
The raid provided a psychological lift
back home and marked a turning point
in the Pacific theater of the war. He
was humble about his role in this mis-
sion and chalked it up to duty. In 2016,
when remembering the raid, he said:
‘‘We were the only B–25 crew operating
for months. We were going on that mis-
sion whether we wanted to or not. That
straightens out that fairy tale.’’ He
was awarded the Distinguished Flying
Cross for heroism for this mission.
Cole remained in China to continue
flying bombing and transport missions
through the end of the war. He is the
only American serviceman of the 16
million who served in World War II to
have flown in three elite groups: the
Doolittle Raiders, the Himalayan
Hump Route pilots, and the 1st Air
Commandos.
After retiring from a distinguished
26-year long career in the U.S. Air
Force, he spent much of his time as an
ambassador for the Air Force and Doo-
little Raiders. He traveled the country
to keep the history and legacy of the
Doolittle Raiders alive and honor those
who served beside him.
On April 9, Lt. Col. Cole passed away
at the age of 103 years old. What an in-
credible life. He captured the hearts of
everyone who met him, and he will for-
ever be remembered as a hero who
faithfully executed his duty for our
Country.
Godspeed, Lt. Col. Dick Cole.

REMEMBERING WILLIAM M.
DETWEILER
∑ Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today
I rise to honor the life and legacy of
William M. Detweiler who passed away
on March 27, 2019, at age 79. Mr.
Detweiler was a lifelong advocate for
veterans and a former national com-
mander of the American Legion. His
commitment to our country stands as
a shining example for every American.
He leaves behind a legacy of compas-
sion for his fellow servicemembers that
touched everyone who knew him.
Mr. Detweiler was born in New Orle-
ans, LA, on January 28, 1940. He was a
graduate of St. Aloysius High School
and Loyola University, where he
earned both his undergraduate and law
degrees.
Mr. Detweiler served as a captain in
the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps and,
later, as assistant chief of staff for the
U.S. Army Defense Center at Fort
Bliss, TX. He then joined the U.S.
Army Reserve and returned home to
New Orleans to practice law.
During his law career, Mr. Detweiler
served on various local, State, and na-
tional veterans committees. In 1973,
President Nixon appointed him to serve
on the Veterans Administration’s Na-
tional Rehabilitation and Education
Advisory Committee, which he later
went on to chair.
As a member of the American Le-
gion, Mr. Detweiler served in a number
of capacities including Department of
Louisiana judge advocate, chairman of
the National Public Relations Commis-
sion, chairman of the National Foreign
Relations Commission, national vice
commander, and national commander.
While serving as national commander
of the American Legion, he fought for
the extension of service-connected dis-
ability benefits for Vietnam veterans
exposed to Agent Orange. He was also
involved in the planning and develop-
ment of the National D-Day Museum in
the heart of New Orleans, which later
became the National WWII Museum.
In his most recent leadership role
with the American Legion, Mr.
Detweiler served as the chairman of
the organization’s traumatic brain in-
jury—TBI—and posttraumatic stress
disorder–PTSD–committee. He was
serving as chairman of that committee
on March 27, 2019, when his final battle,
with pancreatic cancer, came to an
end.
William M. Detweiler was a tireless
advocate for the veterans community,
and we thank him for his lifetime of
service to our country.∑

REMEMBERING EUGENIA ‘‘GENIE’’
ZAVALETA
∑ Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, today I
wish to honor the life and legacy of Eu-
genia ‘‘Genie’’ Zavaleta, a community
leader who passed away in Tempe, AZ,
on April 6, 2019, at the age of 92. Genie
Zavaleta was a fighter for immigration
reform, advocate for the DREAM Act,
and a dedicated voice for DACA recipi-
ents. Our State will miss her dearly.
Genie Zavaleta described her life’s
concerns as ‘‘her family, education,
health care, family planning, the envi-
ronment, poverty and injustice, the
Presbyterian Church and the Demo-
cratic Party.’’ Throughout her life, she
served these issues through educator
and advocacy roles within the Pres-
byterian Church, the Migrant Ministry
of the National Council of Churches,
Planned Parenthood of Arizona, and
the Maricopa County Health Depart-
ment.
Her immense advocacy work within
the migrant community began in 1958,
when she and her husband Hector took
on roles to serve migrant farm laborers
known as braceros. In 1965, Genie
Zavaleta and her family moved to Ari-
zona, where she focused on helping mi-
grant workers acquire new skills to ad-
just to Arizona’s rapid industrializa-
tion. Eventually, Genie Zavaleta be-
came a fierce advocate for DACA re-
cipients and the DREAM Act.
Genie Zavaleta is survived by her
husband Hector, her sons Dan and
David, and their wives Nori and Linda.
She will be dearly missed by other fam-
ily members, friends, and the hundreds
of people whose lives she touched.
Please join me in honoring her
memory.∑

Federal Government for implementing strat-
egies, practices, and technologies to miti-
gate the effects of urban flooding.
(m) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that, because the pilot program is
limited with respect to scope and resources,
communities that participate in the pilot
program should acknowledge that the most
successful efforts to mitigate the effects of
urban flooding—
(1) take a structural-based mitigation ap-
proach with respect to construction, which
includes—
(A) recognizing any post-storm damage
that may occur; and
(B) pursuing designs that proactively mini-
mize future flood damage;
(2) make individuals in the community
aware, through any cost-effective and avail-
able means of education, of the best ap-
proaches regarding the construction of prop-
erties that are able to survive floods, which
reduces the cost of future repairs; and
(3) encourage home and property owners to
consider the measures described in para-
graphs (1) and (2), which are the most cost-
effective and prudent ways to reduce the im-
pact of flooding, when constructing or ren-
ovating building components.
(n) FUNDING.—There are authorized to be
appropriated for grants under the pilot pro-
gram—
(1) $1,200,000 for fiscal year 2020; and
(2) $4,300,000 for fiscal year 2021, to remain
available through 2023.

MARKEY, Mr. CORNYN, Mr. CARDIN, Mr.
GARDNER, Mr. MERKLEY, Mr. KAINE,
Mrs. SHAHEEN, Mr. COONS, and Mr. DUR-
BIN) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations:
S. RES. 179
Whereas Article 19 of the United Nations
Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
adopted at Paris December 10, 1948, states,
‘‘Everyone has the right to freedom of opin-
ion and expression; this right includes free-
dom to hold opinions without interference
and to seek, receive and impart information
and ideas through any media and regardless
of frontiers.’’;
Whereas, in 1993, the United Nations Gen-
eral Assembly proclaimed May 3 of each year
as ‘‘World Press Freedom Day’’—
(1) to celebrate the fundamental principles
of freedom of the press;
(2) to evaluate freedom of the press around
the world;
(3) to defend the media against attacks on
its independence; and
(4) to pay tribute to journalists who have
lost their lives while working in their profes-
sion;
Whereas, on December 18, 2013, the United
Nations General Assembly adopted Resolu-
tion 68/163 on the safety of journalists and
the problem of impunity, which unequivo-
cally condemns all attacks on, and violence
against, journalists and media workers, in-
cluding torture, extrajudicial killing, en-
forced disappearance, arbitrary detention,
and intimidation and harassment in conflict
and nonconflict situations;
Whereas the theme for World Press Free-
dom Day on May 3, 2019 is ‘‘Media for Democ-
racy: Journalism and Democracy in Times of
Disinformation’’;
Whereas Thomas Jefferson, who recognized
the importance of the press in a constitu-
tional republic, wisely declared, ‘‘... were it
left to me to decide whether we should have
a government without newspapers, or news-
papers without a government, I should not
hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.’’;
Whereas the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the
Press Act of 2009 (Public Law 111–166; 22
U.S.C. 2151 note), which the Senate passed by
unanimous consent and President Barack
Obama signed into law in 2010, expanded the
examination of the freedom of the press
around the world in the annual country re-
ports on human rights practices of the De-
partment of State;
Whereas the 2019 World Press Freedom
Index, published by Reporters Without Bor-
ders, warns ‘‘The number of countries re-
garded as safe, where journalists can work in
complete security, continues to decline,
while authoritarian regimes tighten their
grip on the media.’’;
Whereas, Freedom House’s publication
‘‘Freedom in the World 2019’’ noted that
global freedom of expression has declined
each year for the past 13 years;
Whereas, according to the Committee to
Protect Journalists, in 2018—
(1) at least 54 journalists were killed
around the world for their work, of which at
least 34 were singled out for murder;
(2) the 2 deadliest countries for journalists
on assignment were Afghanistan and Syria;
(3) the most dangerous subject for a jour-
nalist to report on was politics, followed by
war;
(4) 251 journalists worldwide were in pris-
on, with Turkey, China, and Egypt respon-
sible for more than 1⁄2 of the jailed journal-
ists;
(5) 13 percent of the journalists in jail were
female, an increase from 8 percent in 2017;
(6) 70 percent of the journalists who were
imprisoned around the world faced anti-state
charges, such as belonging to or aiding
groups deemed by authorities as terrorist or-
ganizations; and
(7) the number of journalists imprisoned on
charges of false news rose to 28 globally,
compared with 9 such imprisonments in 2016;
Whereas, Reuters journalists Wa Lone and
Kyaw Soe Oo, recipients of the 2018 PEN/
Barbey Freedom to Write Award—
(1) were arrested in December 2017 for in-
vestigating the murder by the Burmese mili-
tary of 10 Rohingya men in the village of Inn
Dinn in Rakhine State; and
(2) were sentenced in September 2018 to 7
years in prison on fraudulent charges of
breaching the colonial-era Official Secrets
Act, and remain unjustly imprisoned;
Whereas freedom of the press has been
under considerable pressure in recent years
throughout Southeast Asia, including in the
Philippines, where the government has
waged a campaign of judicial harassment
against the news website Rappler and its edi-
tor, Maria Ressa;
Whereas, Nouf Abdulaziz, Loujain Al-
Hathloul, and Eman Al-Nafjan, recipients of
the 2019 PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write
Award, who wrote in opposition to Saudi
Arabia’s repressive Guardianship system,
have been subjected to imprisonment, soli-
tary confinement, and torture by the Gov-
ernment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
since May 2018 in an apparent effort to sup-
press dissent and silence the voices of
women;
Whereas, Washington Post journalist and
United States resident Jamal Khashoggi was
murdered by a team of Saudi operatives
while visiting the Saudi Arabian consulate
in Istanbul, Turkey;
Whereas the Central Intelligence Agency
concluded with high confidence, and the Sen-
ate unanimously approved a resolution stat-
ing, that Mr. Khashoggi’s murder was car-
ried out at the behest of Crown Prince Mo-
hammed bin Salman;
Whereas journalist Mimi Mefo Takambou
was jailed for 4 days in Cameroon in Novem-
ber 2018 on charges of spreading false news
while investigating the death of an American
missionary, where 4 out of the 7 total jour-
nalists imprisoned in Cameroon were jailed
for spreading false news, which is a rising
trend in Cameroon and elsewhere around the
world;
Whereas according to the Committee to
Protect Journalists, at least 26 journalists
were killed in Honduras since 2007, making it
one of the most deadly countries for journal-
ists in the Americas, and where journalist
Leonardo Gabriel Hernandez was murdered
in March 2019 after receiving threats related
to his work;
Whereas in Nicaragua, Miguel Mora and
Lucı́a Pineda Ubau, the directors of the
country’s only 24-hour cable news network,

have been jailed since December 2018 on
charges of fomenting hate, spreading fake
news, and terrorism, and prominent jour-
nalist Carlos Fernando Chamorro has fled
the country as President Daniel Ortega
cracks down on free expression in a bid to si-
lence dissent and end the protests against
him;
Whereas in Mexico, which remains the
most dangerous country in the Western
Hemisphere for journalists—
(1) murders, death threats, and legal impu-
nity cause journalists to self censor their re-
porting out of fear; and
(2) Rafael Murúa Manrı́quez was abducted
and murdered in January 2019 after reporting
threats from an official in the municipal
government for critical reporting;
Whereas Slovakian journalist Ján Kuciak
and his partner Martina Kušnı́rová were
murdered in February 2018, allegedly in re-
taliation for his investigative reporting of
tax fraud in connection to a businessman
with close ties to Slovakia’s ruling party,
where the perpetrator awaits trial, just 4
months after the murder of another Euro-
pean journalist, Malta’s Daphne Caruana
Galizia, for her reporting on corruption;
Whereas the world’s growing cadre of eth-
ical and hard-hitting investigative journal-
ists, including those contributing to the Or-
ganized Crime and Corruption Reporting
Project—
(1) adhere to the highest professional
standards;
(2) uncover abuses and corruption being
committed in their own countries; and
(3) deserve the international community’s
support and praise for taking on the risky
job of fostering accountability and trans-
parency in their respective countries;
Whereas, under the auspices of the United
States Agency for Global Media, the United
States Government provides financial assist-
ance to several editorially independent
media outlets, including Voice of America,
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio
Free Asia, Radio y Television Marti, and the
Middle East Broadcast Networks—
(1) which report and broadcast news, infor-
mation, and analysis in critical regions
around the world; and
(2) whose journalists regularly face harass-
ment, fines, and imprisonment for their
work;
Whereas freedom of the press—
(1) is a key component of democratic gov-
ernance, activism in civil society, and socio-
economic development; and
(2) enhances public accountability, trans-
parency, and participation in civil society
and democratic governance:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) expresses concern about threats to free-
dom of the press and free expression around
the world on the occasion of World Press
Freedom Day on May 3, 2019;
(2) commends journalists and media work-
ers around the world, despite threats to their
safety, for their essential role in—
(A) promoting government accountability;
(B) defending democratic activity; and
(C) strengthening civil society;
(3) pays tribute to journalists who have
lost their lives carrying out their work;
(4) calls on governments abroad to imple-
ment United Nations General Assembly Res-
olution 163 (2013) by thoroughly inves-
tigating and seeking to resolve outstanding
cases of violence against journalists, includ-
ing murders and kidnappings, while ensuring
the protection of witnesses;
(5) condemns all actions around the world
that suppress freedom of the press;
(6) reaffirms the centrality of freedom of
the press to efforts of the United States Gov-
ernment to support democracy, mitigate
conflict, and promote good governance do-
mestically and around the world; and
(7) calls on the President and the Secretary
of State—
(A) to preserve and build upon the leader-
ship of the United States on issues relating
to freedom of the press, on the basis of the
protections afforded the American people
under the First Amendment to the Constitu-
tion of the United States;
(B) to improve the rapid identification,
publication, and response by the United
States Government to threats against free-
dom of the press around the world;
(C) to urge foreign governments to trans-
parently investigate and bring to justice the
perpetrators of attacks against journalists;
and
(D) to highlight the issue of threats
against freedom of the press in the annual
country reports on human rights practices of
the Department of State and through diplo-
matic channels.
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, free-
dom of the press is a fundamental
human right, a foundational pillar of
democracy, and an indispensable check
on authoritarian overreach. Today,
press freedom is under assault across
the globe—including in the United
States. As journalists fight to advance
truth and objectivity, far too many
governments and non-state actors are
targeting them, seeking to thwart
their efforts to promote transparency
and accountability and expose abuses
of power. Their focus on attacking
journalists indeed serves to highlight
their critical work.
Since 2009, 659 journalists and media
workers have been killed in connection
with their efforts to report and dis-
seminate news and information. Sto-
ries of abuses of government power, of
human suffering, of environmental dis-
asters, and stories of the remarkable
resilience of people abused and op-
pressed. 2018 marked the worst year on
record for deadly violence and abuse
toward journalists, with murders, im-
prisonment, hostage-taking, and en-
forced disappearances all on the rise.
Slovak journalist Jan Kuciak and his
partner Martina Kusnirova were
gunned down in their home after inves-
tigating organized crime in his country
and in alleged retaliation for his re-
porting of tax fraud on a businessman
with close ties to Slovakia’s ruling
party, a stark reminder of the danger
reporters sometimes face when inves-
tigating corruption at the highest lev-
els.
Just over a year ago, in the deadliest
day for Afghanistan’s media since the
start of the war, nine journalists were
killed in a second-wave suicide bomb-
ing in Kabul, and another was shot
dead in the eastern city of Khost, a
sign of the constant threat against the
fundamental elements of a free, secure,
and democratic Afghanistan.
Last October, at the Saudi Arabian
consulate in Istanbul, Washington Post
columnist and U.S. resident Jamal
Khashoggi was brutally murdered by a
group of Saudi operatives at the behest
of Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman, showing the reach of political
oppression and the silencing of dissent.
In many cases, crimes carried out
against the media go unpunished—this
includes murder, the ultimate form of
censorship. According to the Com-
mittee to Protect Journalists, in nine
out of 10 cases where a journalist has
been targeted for murder, the perpe-
trator goes free, reflecting widespread
impunity in this space.
In 2018, across the world 251 journal-
ists remained imprisoned on charges
related to their reporting. Last month,
Burma’s Supreme Court upheld the
conviction and prison sentence of Pul-
itzer Prize-winning reporters Wa Lone
and Kyaw Soe Oo, who were arrested
after exposing the massacre of ten
Rohingya men in a village in Rakhine
State. In Nicaragua, Miguel Mora and
Lucı́a Pineda Ubau, directors of the
country’s only 24-hour cable news net-
work, were jailed on charges of foment-
ing hate, spreading fake news, and ter-
rorism, falling victim to President
Daniel Ortega’s widespread crackdown
on dissent and freedom of expression.
While in different countries, these on-
going imprisonments are in countries
with degrading records on human
rights and fundamental freedoms more
broadly.
In the last year, governments have
ramped up similar attempts to silence
the press in places like Turkey and the
Philippines. Beyond threats to journal-
ists themselves, governments across
the world from Poland to Sudan con-
tinue to pursue legislative efforts to re-
strict media freedom and free expres-
sion, ultimately weakening the ability
of citizens to hold their governments
accountable. In Bangladesh, photo-
journalist and human rights advocate
Shahidul Alam faced torture and spent
107 days in prison for violating a law
that forbids criticism of the govern-
ment on digital platforms in his native
Bangladesh. One of several journalists
who were named Time’s Person of the
Year in 2018 for being one of ‘‘the
guardians’’ in the face of the ‘‘war on
truth,’’ he expressed, ‘‘The world over,
journalism is under threat. Whether
you’re a teacher, a dancer, a painter, or
a journalist, each one of us needs to be
constantly fighting.’’
But the threat to press freedom isn’t
limited to foreign lands—it is some-
thing we’ve had to increasingly con-
tend with here at home in the United
States. President Trump continues to
employ dangerous rhetoric in targeting
the media, referring to the free press as
the ‘‘enemy of the people,’’ and fos-
tering an environment of hostility to-
ward journalists. Moreover, he refuses
to hold autocratic world leaders ac-
countable as they attack press freedom
in brazen ways, including targeting
American journalists in places like
Egypt. This only adds to the deteriora-
tion in free expression throughout the
world. As a recent report from Report-
ers Without Borders highlights, ‘‘The
number of countries regarded as safe,
where journalists can work in complete
security, continues to decline, while
authoritarian regimes continue to
tighten their grip on the media.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2575
May 1, 2019
In spite of the unprecedented assault
on the free press, journalists continue
to take significant risks in the pursuit
of truth and transparency. Journalists
from Radio Free Asia have relentlessly
covered the Chinese government’s
gross human rights abuses against the
country’s Uyghur minority, including
mass internment and surveillance in
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
gion (XUAR). If not for the work of
these courageous reporters—many of
whom are Uyghurs themselves, having
to report on abuses exacted against
their families and friends—Chinese au-
thorities would be able to commit such
abuses largely in secrecy. Instead,
those who champion human rights will
be able to use the reporting in order to
hold this repressive government to ac-
count.
Over 200 years ago, our Founding Fa-
thers had the foresight to recognize the
importance of a free press to a fledg-
ling democracy, enshrining it in our
first amendment. Today, that impor-
tance cannot be overstated. Recog-
nizing that societies where informed
citizens can hold their governments ac-
countable are more stable, secure, and
prosperous, we have a responsibility to
stand up for the fundamental right of
free expression and free press. I join
the international community in hon-
oring and defending freedom of expres-
sion and the brave journalists seeking
to tell a story that deserves to be told.
In fact, the very fact the repressive
governments, autocrats, and thugs con-
tinue to attack journalists is a tragic
testament to the critical work they do.
Just yesterday, the Maduro govern-
ment in Venezuela took CNN off the air
while the network was broadcasting
live video of protestors being run over
by military vehicles in Caracas, a
transparent attempt by a criminal re-
gime to silence journalists telling the
story of brave Venezuelans standing up
for their democratic aspirations.
This week, I introduced a resolution
commemorating World Press Freedom
Day. The resolution highlights increas-
ing threats to freedoms of the press
and expression worldwide, reaffirms
the centrality of a free and inde-
pendent press to the health of democ-
racy, and reiterates freedom of the
press as a priority of the United States
in promoting democracy, human
rights, and good governance. On this
World Press Freedom Day, I call on the
Trump administration to reverse
course and recommit to advancing
press freedom—both at home and
abroad.’’

would pose a clear danger to the economy of
the United States;
Whereas, on March 4, 2019, former Sec-
retary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Sum-
mers said that—
(1) MMT is fallacious at multiple levels;
(2) past a certain point, MMT leads to
hyperinflation; and
(3) a policy of relying on a central bank to
finance government deficits, as advocated by
MMT theorists, would likely result in a col-
lapsing exchange rate;
Whereas, on February 26, 2019, Jerome
Powell, Chair of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System, said: ‘‘The idea
that deficits don’t matter for countries that
can borrow in their own currency I think is
just wrong’’;
Whereas, on March 25, 2019, Janet Yellen,
former Chair of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System, disagreed with
those individuals promoting MMT who sug-
gest that ‘‘you don’t have to worry about in-
terest-rate payments because the central
bank can buy the debt’’, stating: ‘‘That’s a
very wrong-minded theory because that’s
how you get hyper-inflation’’;
Whereas the March 2019 report entitled
‘‘How Reliable is Modern Monetary Theory
as a Guide to Policy?’’ by Scott Sumner and
Patrick Horan of the Mercatus Center at
George Mason University found that—
(1) MMT—
(A) has a flawed model of inflation,
which overestimates the importance of eco-
nomic slack;
(B) overestimates the revenue that can
be earned from the creation of money;
(C) overestimates the potency of fiscal
policy, while underestimating the effective-
ness of monetary policy;
(D) overestimates the ability of fiscal au-
thorities to control inflation; and
(E) contains too few safeguards against
the risks of excessive public debt; and
(2) an MMT agenda of having fiscal au-
thorities manage monetary policy would run
the risk of—
(A) very high debts;
(B) very high inflation; or
(C) very high debts and very high infla-
tion, each of which may be very harmful to
the broader economy;
Whereas the January 2019 report entitled
‘‘Modern Monetary Theory and Policy’’ by
Stan Veuger of the American Enterprise In-
stitute warned that ‘‘hyperinflation becomes
a real risk’’ when a government attempts to
pay for massive spending by printing money;
and
Whereas the September 2018 report entitled
‘‘On Empty Purses and MMT Rhetoric’’ by
George Selgin of the Cato Institute warned
that—
(1) when it comes to the ability of Congress
to rely on the Treasury to cover expendi-
tures, Congress is, in 1 crucial respect, more
constrained than an ordinary household or
business is when that household or business
relies on a bank to cover expenditures be-
cause, if Congress is to avoid running out of
money, Congress cannot write checks in
amounts exceeding the balances in the gen-
eral account of the Treasury; and
(2) MMT theorists succeed in turning oth-
erwise banal truths about the workings of
contemporary monetary systems into novel
policy pronouncements that, although tanta-
lizing, are false: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) realizes that deficits are unsustainable,
irresponsible, and dangerous; and
(2) recognizes—
(A) that the implementation of Modern
Monetary Theory would lead to higher defi-
cits and higher inflation; and
(B) the duty of the Senate to condemn
Modern Monetary Theory.

SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLU-
TION 15—EXPRESSING SUPPORT
FOR THE DESIGNATION OF OCTO-

NATION’S FIRST RESPONDERS
DAY’’

mental Affairs:
S. CON. RES. 15
Whereas first responders include profes-
sional and volunteer fire, police, emergency
medical technician, and paramedic workers
in the United States;
Whereas, according to a 2017 compilation of
data on the Emergency Services Sector in
the United States by the Department of
Homeland Security, ‘‘The first responder
community comprises an estimated 4.6 mil-
lion career and volunteer professionals with-
in five primary disciplines: Law Enforce-
ment, Fire and Rescue Services, Emergency
Medical Services, Emergency Management,
and Public Works.’’;
Whereas first responders deserve to be rec-
ognized for their commitment to safety, de-
fense, and honor; and
Whereas October 28, 2019, would be an ap-
propriate day to establish as ‘‘Honoring the
Nation’s First Responders Day’’: Now, there-
fore, be it
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That Congress—
(1) supports the designation of October 28,
2019, as ‘‘Honoring the Nation’s First Re-
sponders Day’’;
(2) honors and recognizes the contributions
of first responders; and
(3) encourages the people of the United
States to observe Honoring the Nation’s
First Responders Day with appropriate cere-
monies and activities that promote aware-
ness of the contributions of first responders
in the United States.

NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS
AND AMERICAN SAMOA COLLEGE
ACCESS ACT
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO
SABLAN
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 1, 2019
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Northern Mariana Islands and
American Samoa College Access Act, which
would authorize tuition assistance grants to
cover the difference between in-state and out-
of-state tuition costs for Northern Marianas
and American Samoa community college
graduates seeking to attend a four-year public
university.
The importance of having an educated citi-
zenry is a bedrock principle of our nation and
has been since our founding. And in today’s
competitive job market, a postsecondary edu-
cation is increasingly becoming a critical ne-
cessity for obtaining a decent job with a de-
cent wage.
The Northern Mariana Islands has only
been part of America for forty years. We un-
derstand well that education is key to our con-
tinued growth, but the reality is that household
incomes in the Northern Marianas are less
than half the national median. The U.S. terri-
tory of American Samoa is in similar economic
straits. Poverty and unemployment rates there
are among the highest in the country.
I believe the best way to improve economic
conditions in these territories is to improve the
educational opportunities of our residents. Un-
fortunately, however, neither the Northern
Marianas nor American Samoa has a four-
year institution of higher education. In fact,
they are the only two congressional districts in
the country without a public four-year college
or university. Each has an accredited commu-
nity college, but academic offerings are sub-
stantially limited.
Students from these U.S. territories wanting
the advantages of a four-year university in an-
other state or territory face significant financial
difficulty. Nonresident students spend an aver-
age of $14,480 in out-of-state tuition and fees
more per year than their resident peers at
public four-year colleges, according to College
Board. And many students in the Marianas
and American Samoa wanting to attend a
four-year university not only face the cost of
nonresident tuition, but also the significant ex-
pense of travel. The Marianas are over 3,700
miles from the nearest state, Hawaii—a
$1,100 one-way trip by plane. American
Samoa to Hawaii is over 2,500 miles, over
$800 one-way.
The bill follows the model of P.L. 106–98,
the DC College Access Act, which allows stu-
dents residing in the District of Columbia to
apply for grants to help pay the cost of attend-
ing colleges outside D.C., but much smaller in
scope and cost. It creates a program through
which public four-year schools in the 50
states, D.C., and other U.S. territories may be
reimbursed for offering in-state tuition to un-
dergraduate students from the Northern Mar-
iana Islands and American Samoa.
The gentlelady from American Samoa, Mrs.
RADEWAGEN, is an original cosponsor of the
bill. I urge my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan legislation and help give students from
the Northern Marianas and American Samoa
the means needed to make their educational
dreams a reality.

HONORING ESSEX COUNTY
COLLEGE’S 50TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR.
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 1, 2019
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I proudly
honor Essex County College on the occasion
of its 50th anniversary. Over the past half-cen-
tury, Essex County College has helped edu-
cate and enlighten thousands of students from
New Jersey and across the country.
Essex County College opened in 1968 to
more than 3 thousand students. By 1970, the
school needed a new campus and was relo-
cated to what we now call University Heights
in the Central Ward of Newark—across the
street from my congressional district office.
Essex County College has grown and ex-
panded across the community in the decades
since it opened. Today, Essex County College
has more than 13 thousand students across
its degree, certificate, and job training pro-
grams.
Throughout the 1970s and continuing today,
Essex County College has invested in local
communities. The school has opened and op-
erated extension campuses throughout Essex
County. It provides off-campus educational
services like the popular Saturday Youth Pro-
grams. Essex County College helps students
enter the workplace with marketable skills.
Essex County College has provided a foun-
dation of education for generations of stu-
dents. Through leadership and community in-
vestment, Essex County College is leading the
way toward greater opportunity. Under Presi-
dent Anthony Munroe, I know that Essex
County College will continue to flourish for
years to come. I ask that my colleagues join
me in celebrating their 50th anniversary.

HONORING MAJOR CHRISTOPHER
PETRANCOSTA
HON. LEE M. ZELDIN
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 1, 2019
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, today I rise
to recognize Major Christopher Vincent
Petrancosta of the United States Army for his
extraordinary dedication to duty and service to
our nation. Major Petrancosta will soon transi-
tion from his current assignment as an Army
Congressional Liaison to the House of Rep-
resentatives to attend Army Intermediate Level
Education with follow on assignment at Fort
Drum.
A native of Hot Springs, Arkansas, Chris is
a third generation Army Soldier, continuing a
proud family tradition of service to this nation.
Chris attended the United States Military
Academy at West Point and commissioned as
an Infantry Officer in 2007. He has held nu-
merous leadership and staff assignments in a
variety of units, highlighted by operational and
combat deployments to Haiti, Afghanistan,
Iraq, Djibouti, and Niger during service with
the 82nd Airborne Division and First Infantry
Division. During his time in Washington, Chris
earned a Masters in Policy Management from
Georgetown University and worked as a Polit-
ical Military Planner within the Joint Staff’s
Transregional Threats Coordination Cell.
In 2018, Major Petrancosta was selected to
serve as a Congressional Liaison in the United
States Army House Liaison Division. As the
primary liaison between Members of the
House of Representatives, their staffs, com-
mittees, and the Army, he provided insight and
understanding of Army policies, actions, oper-
ations, and requirements. His first-hand knowl-
edge of the military, its culture, and traditions
has been a tremendous benefit to Congres-
sional offices. This previous Christmas, I trav-
eled with Chris to the Middle East to visit our
servicemembers and better understand the re-
gion. Chris’ extensive experience in the region
enabled a productive visit for myself and other
Members of Congress. I found him to be a
thoughtful, intelligent, and dedicated Soldier in
the best traditions of America’s Armed Forces.
Madam Speaker, it has been a pleasure to
work with Chris during his time as an Army
Congressional Liaison Officer in the House of
Representatives. On behalf of a grateful na-
tion, it is my honor to recognize the selfless
service and sacrifice of Major Christopher
Petrancosta, his wife, Stacia, and their chil-
dren, Tatum and Maryn. I wish them the very
best as they continue their journey in the
United States Army, and continue to dedicate
their lives to the service of our nation.

Navy in 2011 and has served in numerous as-
signments and deployments throughout his
distinguished career.
Lieutenant Rezzo has shown not only out-
standing leadership skills, but also uncommon
technical prowess. Over the course of six
months as a Junior Officer on the USS Char-
lotte, he safely supervised the entire ship
watch team during surface and submerged op-
erations and managed the maintenance of an
attack submarine’s mechanical systems. He
also achieved certification from the United
States Department of Energy to assume over-
all responsibility of a US Naval Nuclear Power
Plant.
Since November 2016, Lieutenant Rezzo
has led a major revision of the Undersea War-
fare Division’s strategic plan, articulating future
investment areas to industry, fleet users, pro-
gram offices and other stakeholders with the
aim of maintaining undersea dominance. He
continues to coordinate plans to transition
high-end asset programs that expand reliable
communications throughout the maritime do-
main.
Most recently, Lieutenant Rezzo was also
working on facilitating a $150 million-dollar
rapid acquisition effort to expand maritime sur-
veillance worldwide in support of a critically
important Chief of Naval Operations directive.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Virginia’s
Eighth Congressional District I commend my
constituent, Lieutenant David John Rezzo on
his years of devoted service to the United
States of America and ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in recognizing him.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF
DR. ALEXANDER P. STONE
HON. JERRY McNERNEY
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 1, 2019
Mr. McNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I ask my
colleagues to join me in commemorating the
life of Dr. Alexander P. Stone.
Dr. Stone was a patient teacher, a mathe-
matical scholar and creator, and a true gen-
tleman. Under his guidance, his students
learned more than the fundamentals of cal-
culus and how to solve differential equations
on curved surfaces of arbitrary dimension—he
also instilled in all of us a deep appreciation
for the beauty of abstract mathematical
thought.
Dr. Stone held the admiration and respect of
all those around him. His breadth of knowl-
edge was clear, and so was his determination
as a mathematical mentor to make sure that
his students had the instruction and personal
attention they needed to excel. He never belit-
tled anyone for asking what may have seemed
like a trivial or obvious question and went out
of his way to put students at ease during cas-
ual conversations as well as in high stakes
exams. He celebrated with us as we made
new mathematical discoveries that led to our
growth and success.
Alex was also a devoted father, which was
made clear during dinnertime at his home. His
young son was always welcome to join the
conversation, setting an example for how to
teach children to be inquisitive and engaged
without being disruptive.
Dr. Stone’s empathy was boundless. He
had a rare combination of great kindness in
addition to great knowledge. He touched the
lives of all who entered his classroom, and he
will be missed.

IMPORTANCE OF INTERNATIONAL
STUDENTS AND SCHOLARS IN
THE UNITED STATES
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 1, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, today is Na-
tional Decision Day. It is an exciting time of
year for students as they commit to colleges
across the United States. I rise to speak in
support of the international scholars who
choose to attend our American academic insti-
tutions. Their presence in the U.S. is an asset
to our country’s culture and economy.
While the Department of State’s annual
Open Doors report states that the United
States is still the top location for international
students, a concerning statistic shows that
new international student enrollment declined
by 6.6 percent during the 2017–2018 school
year.
The congressional district I represent greatly
benefits from international student enrollment
in our local colleges and universities. In addi-
tion to their intellectual and research contribu-
tions, these students make an annual financial
contribution of $52.2 million dollars and sup-
port the creation of several hundred jobs each
year. We’re at risk of losing this valuable tal-
ent and the benefits they bring to the residents
of New York’s 16th District.
But it’s not just my district that will suffer—
the entire country will. Although they only
make up 5.5 percent of higher education en-
rollment in the United States, the economic
value that international students have on our
economy is significant. In the 2017–2018 aca-
demic year alone, international students study-
ing at U.S. colleges and universities contrib-
uted $39 billion to the U.S. economy and sup-
ported over 450,000 jobs. For every seven
international students enrolled, three U.S. jobs
are created and supported through spending
in the higher education, health insurance, and
transportation sectors, among others.
International education doesn’t just foster
economic benefits; it advances learning and
scholarship. Students want to come to the
United States because they know that this
country has some of the world’s greatest edu-
cational opportunities. However, as a result of
delays in processing student visas in recent
years, many international scholars have de-
cided to study in other countries, such as Can-
ada and Australia, which have more wel-
coming policies. As a result, our country is
missing out on incredible talent, and students
are foregoing the opportunity to study in one
of the best education systems in the world.
As the Chairman of the House Committee
on Foreign Affairs, I am grateful for the work
international students are doing every day to
strengthen ties with countries around the
world. International education develops cul-
tural understanding and respect among dif-
ferent peoples.
We need to send the message that inter-
national students and scholars who want to
study in the United States are welcome. I urge
my colleagues to work with me in ensuring
that the United States continues to be the
world’s best destination for academic study.

HONORING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF DISCOUNT DRUG MART
HON. ANTHONY GONZALEZ
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 1, 2019
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I
rise to pay tribute to an Ohio-based drug store
chain, Discount Drug Mart on their 50th Anni-
versary. Small businesses are the heart of
America. They not only create jobs and oppor-
tunities, but engineer vibrant communities to
live and raise our families in.
Like many small businesses in our country,
Discount Drug Mart was established after
somebody took a risk and poured their heart
and soul into a visionary product. In 1969,
Parviz Boodjeh opened the first Discount Drug
Mart in Elyria, Ohio, combining a retail store
with the personal care of a Pharmacist’s of-
fice. By integrating disease management and
screening services with necessities and con-
venience items, Discount Drug Mart has influ-
enced businesses around the globe and con-
tinues to support thousands of Ohioans today.
Mr. Boodjeh’s leadership and compassionate
touch have helped his family expand to over
70 stores and operate in over 20 Ohio coun-
ties. Discount Drug Mart, Inc., serves as a
model for the American Dream and an exam-
ple of what hard work and dedication can ac-
complish.
I offer my sincerest congratulations to this
valued business and celebrate with them for
over a half-century of service to our commu-
nities.

NO MONEY TREE

At an age when children are busy playing
with their new Legos or asking for Happy
Meals, they’re also forming early and
foundational ideas about earning, saving and
spending that they may carry with them
throughout their lives. April is Financial
Literacy Month, so it’s a good time to dis-
cuss why it is important that we teach per-
sonal finance and economics to young chil-
dren.
Children often develop their financial be-

nities to help them learn and shape their
habits. And it leaves children, during very
impressionable years, more apt to construct
their understanding of the economy and per-
sonal finance from what they observe around
them.
This frequently results in misunder-
standings.
For example, children who see their par-
ents get money from an ATM may not have
the context to understand that a bank ac-
count is directly connected to the use of the
ATM. Without that context, a child hearing,
‘‘We can’t afford that this month,’’ is likely
to think, ‘‘Just go get money out of the ma-
chine!’’
Similarly, children may witness an adult
paying for most items with a credit card or
a mobile phone payment service without rec-
ognizing this as money being spent. And
often children don’t connect your work with
income; they may not realize that adults
work and are paid for that work.
At the St. Louis Fed, we have a team of
educators, researchers and specialists who
are making economic education more acces-
sible and creating fun and memorable lessons
and resources for teachers, parents and con-
sumers around the country. In the spirit of
Financial Literacy Month, that team has
compiled six pertinent things we must teach
children:
1. People work to earn income. Be explicit
when explaining to children that you work
to earn money to support your family. Give
them opportunities to earn as well.
2. People spend some income, save some in-
come, and donate some income. Give the
children in your life opportunities to do
this—spend, save, donate.
3. Saving is a good habit. Provide incen-
tives for your children to save, such as offer-
ing to match a percentage of what they put
in their piggy banks. Encourage them to
save a set amount before considering pur-
chasing a new toy.
4. Adults can’t have everything they
want—children can’t, either. Teach them to
prioritize and make careful choices.
5. Spending and saving decisions have con-
sequences. Allow your children to live with—
and talk to them about—those consequences.
6. Banks and credit unions are safe places
to save your money. Tell children about
them, including that those institutions pay
interest on savings.
When they were younger, I tried to share
such personal tips with my children, and
still do today.
We believe, based on research, that chil-
dren who are taught valuable lessons about
spending, saving and other personal finance
topics at a young age are more likely to be-
come adults who are more financially re-
sponsible.
Share the personal finance tips in this arti-
cle with your children, grandchildren, stu-
dents and the other young people in your
life. Research shows it may help them grow
into teenagers and adults with a better grasp
on their personal finances.

supporting four key local entities: fire compa-
nies, ambulance companies, Meals on
Wheels, and the West Pittston Library. Each
year, they raise funds and donate them to
these groups. Members of the Women’s Club
are actively involved with the West Pittston Li-
brary, serving as volunteers and as board
members, and donating money and books in
honor of deceased members.

SHAWN SHELTON TRIBUTE
HON. SCOTT R. TIPTON
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 1, 2019
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Shawn Shelton of Pueblo, Colorado,
who recently retired from the Pueblo Fire De-
partment.
Shawn was born in 1962 in Quantico, Vir-
ginia to Doyle and Elizabeth Shelton. His fa-
ther’s service in the Marine Corps and the Air
Force led to their family moving to various
posts until they eventually settled in Pueblo in
1975. He married Mary Beth Erjavec in 1983
and they have two sons, Timothy and Joshua.
Working odd-jobs as a ranch hand and a me-
chanic, Shawn found his career path in his
early 20’s after a friend’s recommendation and
never looked back. Shawn selflessly helped
countless families in the Pueblo community by
serving as a firefighter for over 30 years.
After three years on the job, Shawn was
promoted as a medic, and a year later re-
ceived another promotion to fire engineer. He
continued to advance in the department when
he was promoted again to captain and then to
assistant fire chief in 2015. Shawn’s dedica-
tion to faithfully serve his community and his
leadership as a team member ultimately led to
him becoming the chief of the Pueblo Fire De-
partment, a position he held for the last three
years of his career.
Firefighters are called to assist in some of
the direst situations, yet their actions can be
remembered for the lifetimes of the people
they help. On one such occasion, while stand-
ing in line at a grocery store, Shawn was rec-
ognized by a woman whose baby he helped
deliver nine years earlier. It’s moments like
that Shawn says he will miss the most.
Madam Speaker, I stand with the Pueblo
Fire Department and the entire community of
Pueblo in thanking Shawn for his service over
the last three decades. I wish him a happy re-
tirement and hope that he knows just how
thankful we are for his remarkable career.
INTRODUCTION OF THE NO TAX
SUBSIDIES FOR STADIUMS ACT
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 1, 2019
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today
I introduced the No Tax Subsidies for Sta-
diums Act of 2019. This bipartisan legislation
returns hundreds of millions of dollars a year
to American taxpayers by disallowing the tax-
exemption for municipal bonds used to finance
professional sports stadiums.
For more than a century, the federal govern-
ment has supported state and local infrastruc-
ture projects by excluding the interest on mu-
nicipal bonds from federal income taxes.
Qualified projects eligible for a tax-exemption
include roads, sewers and water systems,
hospitals, schools, governmental buildings,
and other projects for the public good. How-
ever, a loophole in the tax code allows billion-
aire owners of sports franchises to use public
money to construct stadiums using tax-exempt
municipal bonds.
For the first half of the twentieth century,
professional sports franchises privately-funded
the construction of most stadiums. But begin-
ning in 1953, when the Boston Braves moved
to Milwaukee, most professional sports fran-
chises have used public financing to construct
or rehabilitate their privately-owned stadiums.
Since 2000, 36 professional sports stadiums
have been constructed or rehabilitated under
financing provided by federal tax-exempt mu-
nicipal bonds, costing taxpayers nearly $4 bil-
lion. While professional sports teams promise
state and local governments that their sta-
diums will produce local economic develop-
ment and job creation, there is no quantifiable
evidence that they provide these benefits.
Public financing creates a race to the bottom
where teams worth hundreds of millions, or
even billions, of dollars have all the leverage
to exploit city budgets for their own gain. Too
often, these subsidies also create budgetary
constraints that result in offsetting cuts to crit-
ical public safety and economic security pro-
grams.
I look forward to working with my colleagues
in the House and Senate to pass this legisla-
tion and end the practice of subsidizing billion-
aires’ sports franchises.

CONGRATULATING DR. REBECCA
RICHARDS-KORTUM, DR. JAMES
TRUCHARD AND JEFF KODOSKY,
ON THEIR INDUCTION INTO THE
NATIONAL INVENTOR HALL OF
FAME
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 1, 2019
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to congratulate Dr. Rebecca Rich-
ards-Kortum of Rice University in Houston and
Dr. James Truchard and Jeff Kodosky of Na-
tional Instruments in Austin for their induction
into the National Inventors Hall of Fame on
May 2, 2019.
Dr. Rebecca Richards-Kortum is the first
woman and the youngest Rice faculty member
to earn the rank of University Professor. Early
in her career, as a biomedical engineering
professor at the University of Texas at Austin,
she learned that early screening programs for
cancer were out of reach for many and began
creating a low-cost imaging system to detect
precancerous cells. This technology was fur-
ther developed to detect oral cancer. Studies
later showed that her system could improve
early detection of cancer while drastically re-
ducing costly and unnecessary biopsies. In
her travels to Malawi, she witnessed an issue
with under-equipped neonatal wards, and thus
in 2005 after moving to Rice, Dr. Richards-
Kortum cofounded the Rice 360° Institute for
Global Health where she began working with
students on low-cost, low-power devices to
save newborn lives. Her work has improved
medical care for millions of newborns and
saved thousands of lives in low-income coun-
tries. Her and her team’s successes to date
include systems that help babies breathe and
that help caregivers detect jaundice and accu-
rately dose children’s liquid medication. For
this work, she was the first Houston scientist
and first Houston woman to win a coveted
‘‘genius grant’’ from the MacArthur Founda-
tion.
Dr. James Truchard and Jeff Kodosky, who
will also be inducted into the National Inven-
tor’s Hall of Fame, conceived a better method
of high-end testing using computers instead of
the inefficient data collection methods they
employed as researchers at the University of
Texas Applied Research Laboratories in the
1970s. With their colleague Bill Nowlin, they
founded National Instruments to develop a
concept called virtual instrumentation, where
software and hardware combine to perform
the functions of traditional instruments,
through a product called LabVIEW. LabVIEW
became the flagship product of National In-
struments and is used today by engineers, sci-
entists, academics and students around the
world. Having been adopted across many in-
dustry sectors, its applications are as wide-
ranging as controlling the CERN Large Hadron
Collider to facilitating navigation of the FDA
regulatory process. LabVIEW created a new
paradigm for programming and has been hon-
ored with more than 100 national and inter-
national awards, while National Instruments—
with its global headquarters in Austin—has
grown to become a multinational, billion-dollar
company.
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratu-
lating these outstanding Texas inventors. Their
induction into the National Inventors Hall of
Fame speaks volumes for the culture of inven-
tion, innovation, and entrepreneurship that ex-
ists in the great State of Texas.

RECOGNIZING THE UNIVERSITY OF
GEORGIA TIFTON CAMPUS’ CEN-
TENNIAL
HON. AUSTIN SCOTT
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 1, 2019
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, today I would like to recognize a
century of contributions by the University of
Georgia Tifton Campus to the science of agri-
culture, the advancement of agricultural tech-
nology, and the education of producers, stu-
dents and the public to promote and protect
the U.S. food supply and to help feed people
in need around the world.
In August 1918, the Georgia General As-
sembly authorized the creation of a Georgia
Coastal Plain Experiment Station. In May
1919, my hometown of Tifton was chosen as
the location due in large part to the sur-
rounding area’s vital role in agriculture re-
search, outreach, and education. Today, the
Georgia Coastal Plain Experiment Station is
known as the University of Georgia Tifton
Campus. In its one hundred years, UGA-Tifton
has fulfilled its duties to promote research and
education. Through the years, UGA-Tifton sci-
entists have developed grain varieties that
helped save millions of lives from starvation in
India and Africa; they have developed machin-
ery and technology that made agriculture prof-
itable and sustainable; they have contributed
to the improvement of livestock genetics and
production; they have created a body of sci-
entific research that has helped realize a five-
fold increase in peanut production per acre,
bringing to life the now robust agricultural
economy of the state of Georgia; and they
have contributed to the development of for-
ages and turfgrasses that continue to benefit
ranchers, athletes and homeowners alike.
Just as it was in the early 1900’s, UGA-
Tifton continues to be a cornerstone of agri-
culture research, outreach, and education for
not only South Georgia, but the state and
Southeast region as a whole. The commitment
to its mission and to the wellbeing of humanity
over this century of service is admirable. As it
celebrates this milestone, UGA-Tifton remains
poised and eager to continue that legacy of
excellence in the pursuit of the great discov-
eries that will bring economic prosperity to
rural America, promote greater public health
through better nutrition and a healthier envi-
ronment, and prevent hunger in the world in
the years to come.
On Friday, May 3, 2019, UGA-Tifton will cel-
ebrate and commemorate its impact and
achievements at a showcase event on cam-
pus honoring one hundred years of commit-
ment to the community and higher education.
I congratulate the faculty, staff and greater
UGA-Tifton community on their successes,
thank them for their service, and look forward
to seeing their continued growth and success
for many more years to come.

ARAB AMERICAN HERITAGE
MONTH
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 1, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise to cel-
ebrate April as National Arab American Herit-
age Month to recognize the tremendous con-
tributions Arab Americans have made to our
great nation. Arab Americans have been, and
continue to be, an invaluable part of our Amer-
ican life.
Arab American Heritage Month is a time to
celebrate the accomplishments of people in
the United States with Middle Eastern roots as
well as for the public to become informed
about the history of Arab Americans in the
U.S.
Arab Americans are among the most loyal
and patriotic Americans and have positively
impacted communities throughout America
with contributions to the medical field, agri-
culture sector, law, business, education, the
entertainment industry, politics and beyond.
While celebrating their rich cultural heritage
and embracing resilient family values, strong
work ethic, dedication to education, and diver-
sity in faith and creed, Arab Americans have
added strength to our democracy.
While many unfairly perceive Arab Ameri-
cans as unknown or unfamiliar, Arab Ameri-
cans first began to arrive on American shores
in the late 1800s. About half of the estimated
3,700,000 Arab Americans living in the United
States were born in the U.S., according to the
2000 U.S. Census and the Arab American In-
stitute.
Arab Americans join all citizens in the desire
to see a peaceful and diverse society, where
every individual is treated equally and feels
safe. Celebrating Arab American Heritage
Month allows us to promote public education,
awareness, and policies that are culturally
competent when describing, discussing, or ad-
dressing the impacts of being Arab American
in all aspects of American society.
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to represent
the Arab American constituents in my district,
many of whom I call friends, and to recognize
the incredible contributions and heritage of
Arab Americans who have helped us build a
better nation.

CELEBRATING 25 YEARS OF
CONCERNED MEN COOK
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 1, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Concerned Men Cook on their 25th An-
niversary. Since its founding by former Merced
County Assistant Superintendent Denard
Davis, Concerned Men Cook has provided an
opportunity for members of the community to
break bread while raising money for scholar-
ship funds for local schools in Merced.
As an educator deeply involved in multiple
community organizations, Mr. Davis started
Concerned Men Cook after participating in the
Men’s Cook competition in Los Angeles. Using
his connections from the multiple organiza-
tions he was involved with, Mr. Davis brought
together educators, businesses, and commu-
nity organizations to host a competition to
fundraise money for scholarships for Merced
County students.
Mr. Davis was also a founding member of
the Black Businessmen and Black Educators
of Merced County and president of an African-
American investment group that provided af-
fordable housing to the residents of South
Merced. Though he passed away in 2015, the
Concerned Men Cook competition is one of
many ways his legacy continues to positively
impact Merced County.
Since its founding 25 years ago, Concerned
Men Cook has expanded to consist of five

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF ALFONSO MATANANE
PANGELINAN
HON. MICHAEL F. Q. SAN NICOLAS
OF GUAM
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 1, 2019
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life and legacy of Mr. Al-
fonso Matanane Pangelinan. Alfonso was a
proud son of Guam and faithful public servant
who served honorably in the United States
Army. Alfonso was born on October 22, 1927
and passed away on April 17, 2019 at the age
of 91.
His legacy is highlighted through the various
positions he held in public office. Alfonso
served as Assistant Commissioner of the vil-
lage of Sinajana from 1965 to 1967 and then
as Commissioner of the Village from 1968 to
1973. Alfonso was a member of the Sinajana
Civic Improvement Club in the 1960s and later
served as Director of the Passport Office from
1983 to 1986.
After his retirement from public office, Al-
fonso remained active in the community. He
was an early advocate for the return of
Chamorro lands and federal excess lands to
their original landowners. He remained a de-
voted son, father, and grandfather, passing
down knowledge and traditions to the genera-
tions after him. He was the son of Vicente
Santos and Ana Matanane Pangelinan of
Machanao and Ritidian.
Alfonso was fondly known to play the bass
guitar with other notable Guam musicians,
playing at weddings, fiestas, and family gath-
erings across the island . He had since shared
his talent and love of music by teaching sev-
eral of his grandchildren and great-grand-
children the art of playing the instrument.
I am deeply saddened by the passing of Al-
fonso Matanane Pangelinan. I join the people
of Guam in celebrating his life and the legacy
he leaves behind. He was a dedicated public
servant who worked tirelessly to improve the
quality of life in his village of Sinajana and the
broader island community during and after his
time in office. My prayers are with his family,
loved ones, and friends as they remember
their lives with Alfonso and the memories they
individually shared.
I extend my condolences to his children,
Evangeline P. Flores, Janet P. Leon Guerrero,
Michael C. Pangelinan, Donald C. Pangelinan,
and Rosalyn P. Ochoco, and his grandchildren
and great-grandchildren. He will be deeply
missed, and his memory will live on in the
hearts of the people of Guam.

RECOGNIZING BARBARA BOYD’S
SERVICE TO OUR COMMUNITY ON
HER 90TH BIRTHDAY
HON. ANDRÉ CARSON
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 1, 2019
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker,
today I rise to honor Barbara Boyd on her
90th birthday.
Barbara is a living legend in the Indianapolis
community, and this milestone birthday is the
perfect opportunity to recognize her distin-
guished career in journalism. A true trailblazer
in the Indianapolis media market, Barbara was
the first African-American female to report and
anchor television news in our city. Her impres-
sive career lasted twenty-five years at Chan-
nel 6 news, earning her a spot in both the Na-
tional Association of Black Journalists Hall of
Fame and the Indiana Journalism Hall of
Fame.
She is famously known for a
groundbreaking piece highlighting her own
struggle with breast cancer in which she ad-
dressed the television audience from a hos-
pital bed after undergoing a mastectomy. Bar-
bara was a strong advocate in the fight
against breast cancer. Her brave decision to
share her personal journey helped educate
many people about the disease and inspired
people to seek medical care.
Beyond her work in communications, Bar-
bara has long been involved with numerous
community and civic groups, including the
March of Dimes, the United Negro College
Fund, NAACP, and a host of other organiza-
tions that helped her leave an indelible mark
on our city.
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in
wishing Ms. Barbara Boyd a happy 90th birth-
day and thanking her for her years of dedi-
cated service. Her work has informed and in-
spired countless individuals in our community,
and her legacy serves as an inspiration to
many. She will be treasured for generations to
come.

IN RECOGNITION OF MAXWELL

Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is my great
pleasure to pay special tribute to an out-
standing student from Ohio’s Fifth Congres-

Maxwell Rutledge of Findlay, Ohio has been

FORCED RELIGIOUS CONVERSIONS
IN SINDH, PAKISTAN
HON. BRAD SHERMAN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 1, 2019
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, as Chair
of the Congressional Caucus on Sindh and
Chairman of the Asia Subcommittee in the
House Foreign Affairs Committee, I have re-
peatedly drawn attention to the issue of forced
conversions and other human rights abuses in
the Sindh province of Pakistan. Today, I reit-
erate my concerns about the forced conver-
sions of young Sindhi Hindu girls.
On April 29, the United States Commission
on International Religious Freedom released
its annual report on the world’s most egre-
gious violators of religious freedom. The report
noted that religious freedom in Pakistan con-
tinued to decline in 2018. The Commission
also reported that ‘‘Forced conversions of non-
Muslims continued despite the passage of the
Hindu Marriage Act, which recognizes Hindu
family law.’’
While the numbers are unclear, estimates
suggest that each year, several hundred or
more girls and young women are abducted,
forcibly married, and converted to Islam. There
were at least 1,000 cases of forced conver-
sions of Hindu and Christian girls just in Sindh
Province in 2018, according to the Human
Rights Commission of Pakistan. The actual
number is estimated to be much larger as
most cases go unreported.
Pakistan’s Human Rights Commission also
notes that the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint
Act of 2013, intended to address the issue,
has not been enforced effectively. The state’s
response to forced marriages has been mixed,
especially because the police are insensitive
and indifferent in most cases. When families
report their daughters as missing, this is ig-
nored by the police. Therefore, the abducted
girls remain with their abductors, where they
are often coerced into silence.
The role of some religious leaders adds to
the problem. Mian Mitho, a religious leader
and politician, has participated in numerous
conversions of young Sindhi girls. He has
close connections with the army and the
Prime Minister, and this has allowed him to
continue his activities.
I urge Pakistan’s government to more effec-
tively address the issue of forced abductions,
forced marriages, and forced religious conver-
sions in the Sindh province.

HONORING 100 YEARS OF GOOD-
WILL-EASTER SEALS OF MIN-
NESOTA
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM
OF MINNESOTA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 1, 2019
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor 100 years of outstanding com-
munity service and support from Goodwill-
Easter Seals of Minnesota. Since 1919, Good-
will-Easter Seals of Minnesota has empow-
ered some of our most vulnerable neighbors
by providing services and support to overcome
barriers to employment and pursue lives of
independence and self-reliance.
Saint Paul Goodwill Industries began in
1919 with a store in the basement of the
Church of the Good Shepherd in Saint Paul.
Goodwill trained workers to repair and resell
donated merchandise through its retail oper-
ation. During the Great Depression, the jobs
created through this model became a critical
lifeline for those who had them. Goodwill also
operated a home for the elderly, a Community
House for workers, and a vocational training
program for young persons with physical dis-
abilities.
As the organization grew and matured, it
continued supporting Minnesota’s workforce,
this time, at the request of the federal govern-
ment. Through WWII and afterwards, Goodwill
Industries opened up its much sought after vo-
cational programs to service members return-
ing from their deployments. Some of those
who carried the physical ravages of war with
them were enrolled in new training programs,
and a training center was built to accommo-
date them. This chapter in the history of
Goodwill-Easter Seals is just another example
of this organization rising to the challenge and
equipping people with the tools to be success-
ful in their communities.
Because of its century of expertise and ac-
cumulated knowledge, today Goodwill-Easter
Seals is a leader in policy pertaining to work-
force development for individuals with disabil-
ities and other barriers to work. Now with 50
locations around the state, Goodwill-Easter
Seals Minnesota prevents 60 million pounds of
second-hand items from ending up in landfills,
all while guiding an average of four people per
day into workplaces of their own.
For 100 years, Goodwill-Easter Seals has
provided a pillar of economic stability in com-
munities throughout Minnesota. The Goodwill-
Easter Seals’ model of giving items a second
life, and using the revenue to support effective
job training for members of our community is
one that has stood the test-of-time. The posi-
tive benefits to our community that have accu-
mulated over the years from this approach are
seemingly incalculable. Our community would
be poorer and less vibrant were it not for the
work and diligence of 100 years of staff and
supporters who kept Goodwill-Easter Seals of
Minnesota running efficiently and continuing to
strive for improvement.
Madam Speaker, please join me in cele-
brating 100 years of Goodwill-Easter Seals of
Minnesota empowering and uplifting Min-
nesota’s communities.

Puapua, and Westminster, CA.
After serving 20 years of active duty in the
U.S. Navy, Sualua was honorably discharged
as an E–7 Chief Petty Officer and Electronic
Technician. He returned to Santa Ana, CA

ernment, he introduced television. Sualua ar-
rived with his family in 1964 where he became
the Chief Technician at KVZK–TV on Mount
Alava. Shortly after he served in Leone at the
WVUV radio station. Sualua was a passionate
man who poured his knowledge of electronic
profession into the students at Nu’uuli Poly
Tech High School.
Sualua’s wife of 62 years—Fesili Mata’u
Penitusi Amituana’i Masaniai from the villages
of Faga’alu and Fitiuta preceded him to heav-
en on April 1, 2019. Sualua’s legacy will con-

He was a dedicated community leader of
strong work ethic who served his people and
always a man of great faith, compassion, grat-
itude and reciprocation. He has brought great
honor to our Samoan people. Sualua Tui
Masaniai will be deeply missed, and his life is
worthy of our best memories.
Thank you (Soifua).

RECOGNIZING THE CALIFORNIA
LGBTQ VETERANS MEMORIAL
HON. RAUL RUIZ
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 1, 2019
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to recog-
nize the dedication of the California LGBTQ
Veterans Memorial.
The memorial honors LGBTQ veterans
across the nation who bravely defended our
country and the freedoms we hold dear. Cali-
fornia is the first state in the nation to have a
state memorial for LGBTQ veterans, which en-
shrines the sacrifices of our LGBTQ service
members and reaffirms our commitment to the
LGBTQ community.
The unveiling and dedication ceremony took
place on Saturday, April 27, 2019 in Cathedral
City, California. Organized by AMVETS, an or-
ganization that enhances and safeguards our
nation’s support for veterans, this event in-
cluded a wreath-laying service to remember
our deceased veterans.
The ceremony also honored 26 individuals
with a dove release. Honorees included Jon
Castro, an Army soldier from Corona, Cali-
fornia, who was killed in the bombing of a
mess hall in Iraq. The Rancho Mirage Chapter
of Veterans for Peace, a veterans group dedi-
cated to building a culture of peace in our
communities, was named in his honor.
All of our veterans regardless of gender,
race, religion, sexuality, or gender identity de-
serve our respect for courageously putting
their lives on the line to protect our nation.
And with this memorial, we will recognize our
LGBTQ soldiers who fight every day to defend
our country and protect liberty. It is our solemn
duty to honor and respect their service.
I am grateful to AMVETS, Veterans for
Peace, and all of the other wonderful organi-
zations and people who made this memorial

IN HONOR OF THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE AMERICAN LEGION
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 1, 2019
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the
American Legion Department of New Hamp-
shire. On May 5, 1919, the American Legion
of War Veterans in New Hampshire held its
first meeting when a group of 47 veterans of
World War I convened at the state armory in
Manchester. Within that first year alone, 69
American Legion posts formed across the
state—of those original posts, 41 remain ac-
tive and will also be celebrating their 100th an-
niversary this year.
Over the last century, the American Legion
in New Hampshire has remained committed to
serving veterans, their families, and the state
of New Hampshire. The American Legion is
critical in ensuring that those who have sac-
rificed so much to our great nation are able to
find the same sense of community and service
when they return to civilian life. The sense of
camaraderie fostered at the over 100 Amer-
ican Legion posts in New Hampshire and
among the over 17,000 members in our state
is truly unparalleled.
Veterans and families who are part of the
American Legion community share a common
sense of service to our nation, and also forge
deep bonds with their own communities. Le-
gion posts and members are constantly giving
back in myriad of ways, from sponsoring
American Legion Baseball across the state, to
supporting Operation Military Kids, which
helps children impacted by deployment. Amer-
ican Legionnaires are not only active within
their own communities but also on a larger
scale as they advocate for the interests of vet-
erans across our state and nation. I have had
many productive conversations with Legion-
naires whose knowledge, experience, and
guidance have been instrumental as I advo-
cate for the interests of our nation’s veterans
as a member of the House Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to
congratulate the American Legion Department
of New Hampshire on their 100th anniversary.
Once again, I thank the American Legion for
their century of commitment to serving vet-
erans, their families, and the Granite State as
a whole. I look forward to continuing to work
alongside them to support our nation’s vet-
erans.

IN RECOGNITION OF OLIVIA SKEL-
TON ON HER OFFER OF AP-
POINTMENT TO ATTEND THE
UNITED STATES MILITARY
ACADEMY
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 1, 2019
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is my great
pleasure to pay special tribute to an out-
standing student from Ohio’s Fifth Congres-
sional District. I am pleased to announce that
Olivia Skelton of Convoy, Ohio has been of-
fered an appointment to the United States Mili-
tary Academy in West Point, New York.
Olivia’s offer of appointment permits her to
attend the United States Military Academy this
fall with the incoming Class of 2023. Attending
one of our nation’s military academies not only
offers the opportunity to serve our country, but
also guarantees a world-class education while
undertaking one of the most challenging and
rewarding experiences of their lives.
Olivia brings a tremendous amount of lead-
ership, service, and dedication to the incoming
Class of 2023. While attending Crestview High
School in Convoy, Ohio, Olivia was a scholar
athlete and received numerous academic
achievement awards, as well as attaining a
4.0 GPA and ranked first in her class.
Throughout high school, Olivia was involved
with golf and softball, as well as serving as the
basketball statistician. I am confident that
Olivia will carry the lessons of her student and
athletic leadership to the Military Academy.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in congratulating Olivia Skelton on her
offer of appointment to the United States Mili-
tary Academy. Our service academies offer
the finest military training and education avail-
able. I am positive that Olivia will excel during
her career at West Point, and I ask my col-
leagues to join me in extending their best
wishes to her as she begins her service to our
Nation.
