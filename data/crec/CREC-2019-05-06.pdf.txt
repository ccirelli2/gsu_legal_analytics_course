EXECUTIVE SESSION
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report.
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Joseph F. Bianco, of New
York, to be United States Circuit
Judge for the Second Circuit.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak for 1
minute as in morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, May
has been recognized as National Foster
Care Month for over 20 years to bring
awareness to the challenges that foster
youth face.
Through my work on the Senate Cau-
cus on Foster Youth, I have had the op-
portunity to hear firsthand what chil-
dren in foster care need. They need
love, support, safety, and permanency.
They need a family. I salute all those
who dedicate their time and resources
to help these kids.
In moving forward, I will continue to
work to find better solutions and to se-
cure better outcomes for youth in fos-
ter care.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to speak for an additional 1
minute as in morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
ECONOMIC GROWTH
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last
week, the Department of Labor re-
leased its monthly scorecard for the
U.S. workforce.
The unemployment rate fell to 3.6
percent, which is the lowest rate since
December 1969—a new 50-year low.
Moreover, an additional 263,000 jobs
were created. Job gains have averaged
a robust 218,000 over the past 12
months. Additionally, for the ninth
straight month, year-over-year nomi-
nal wage gains have equaled or exceed-
ed 3 percent.
It is good to see this administration’s
tax reform and pro-growth policies con-
tinuing to improve the daily lives of all
Americans.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

S2626 May 6, 2019
threats that face our friends and allies
in Israel.
While American families enjoyed a
spring weekend, those who make their
home in the border regions of the Jew-
ish State were subjected to a barrage of
hundreds of rockets and other projec-
tiles launched from within Gaza.
The attacks were carried out by
Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic
Jihad. They targeted civilian popu-
lations. They killed a worker at a ce-
ment factory, a truckdriver in a border
village, a man in the yard of his own
home, and a rabbi as he left his car to
run for cover.
They caused countless Israeli citizens
to scurry to bunkers for safety, unsure
whether rockets would rain upon their
farms, apartment buildings, schools, or
hospitals. These attacks, we should re-
member, are targeted at Israel’s inno-
cent civilians. They are intended to
kill, to maim, and to terrorize.
In the face of such brazen acts of ter-
ror, it is of course Israel’s right to take
swift and decisive action to defend its
people. Frankly, it is an existential ne-
cessity.
And it is the responsibility of every
peaceful nation to condemn the ter-
rorist organizations behind them and
to continue to expose those govern-
ments and private entities that provide
illicit support for their actions. Fore-
most among them is Iran, which has
become a critical lifeline for the ter-
rorist activities of Hamas and Pales-
tinian Islamic Jihad.
I know my colleagues will join me in
expressing sympathy for the families of
the victims and for the communities
left to rebuild the wreckage of these
latest attacks. Furthermore, I hope
this weekend’s attacks could at least
spur some action here in Congress,
where Senate-passed legislation to
renew and strengthen our partnership
with Israel is still sitting over in the
House, where it has not been permitted
a vote. That thoroughly bipartisan leg-
islation contains several provisions to
strengthen our security ties to Israel
and also to combat the scourge of anti-
Semitism.
Behind these attacks lurks the same
hatred that motivated the violence at
Chabad of Poway last month and the
Tree of Life synagogue last year—the
same ugly bigotry that takes refuge
within the BDS movement while
masquerading as a legitimate political
stance. It is the same tide of discrimi-
nation that an overwhelming majority
of European Jews report is on the rise
in their own communities, even as the
Holocaust remains a vivid living mem-
ory. This disturbing trend has already
taken its toll on communities of faith
and on peaceful Jews in Israel and
around the world, but when America
does any less than our level best to
confront it, we further undermine the
cause of our friends and allies in this
free Jewish State.
I hope this terrible violence can
again spur my colleagues in the House
to act on the bipartisan legislation
that has been languishing over there
for weeks. It was the first item we took
up this year.
Clearly, the need to reaffirm our
commitment to the safety, security,
and sovereignty of Israel is just as im-
portant as it ever was.
TRIBUTE TO MIKE ENZI
Mr. President, on an entirely dif-
ferent matter, I was saddened to hear
over the weekend that our friend and
colleague Senator MIKE ENZI will not
run for reelection. At the end of next
year, he will retire with 24 years of
service to the people of Wyoming, and
the rest of us will have to step up to
make up for the loss in expertise and in
principled leadership his departure will
create.
When MIKE first arrived in the Sen-
ate, he brought with him experience in
business and government that made
him an immediate asset on a host of
different issues. With an MBA under
his belt, he had returned home to lead
his family shoe sales business through
a successful expansion. As the two-
term mayor of Gillette, WY, he had
presided over an economic and popu-
lation boom, and over the course of 10
years in the State legislature, he had
lent his accountant’s eye to help other
small businesses succeed through bet-
ter policy.
So it is no surprise that MIKE got
right to work as a leading voice on the
Federal budget, tax policy, and
healthcare. Over four terms, he has
taken every opportunity to make an
outsized impact on policy for the peo-
ple of Wyoming and for our entire
country.
In 2006, as chairman of the HELP
Committee, MIKE provided the guiding
hand that delivered the first major
pension reform legislation in a genera-
tion and provided more security to the
retirement income of millions of Amer-
icans through bipartisan policy.
In 2017, as chairman of the Budget
Committee, he helped lay the founda-
tion for the generational reform of our
Nation’s Tax Code and championed im-
portant elements for small businesses
and retirees.
In these cases and in many more, get-
ting MIKE involved in an issue meant
deploying a powerful force for fiscal re-
sponsibility, restraint, and policy prac-
ticality. You always felt more sure
something would turn out well when
MIKE was on the case or part of the
team.
But seeing as our friend has built
nearly a quarter-century legacy in the
Senate, none of us can blame MIKE for
choosing to spend more time with his
even greater legacy: the wonderful
family he and his lovely wife Diana
have built together.
MIKE and Diana are now the proud
grandparents of four, and among every-
thing their bright future holds, I know
MIKE will be excited for more chances
to pass along his fly fishing wisdom
and his love of good books.
Before he hangs up the ‘‘gone fish-
ing’’ sign for good, I know my col-
leagues share my relief that we still
have a year and a half to continue
drawing on Senator ENZI’s leadership
and focused expertise. So today I will
offer just the first of many sincere
thanks for his years of distinguished
service.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
ECONOMIC GROWTH
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it is no
secret that our economy has broken
some pretty amazing records lately.
Last week’s job report surpassed all es-
timates and expectations, with a whop-
ping 263,000 jobs created in April alone.
The first quarter saw 3.2 percent
growth, which is the best in 4 years.
I still recall, back during the pre-
vious administration, when we were
told that 2 percent growth was the new
normal and that we could never grow
our economy the way we have seen in
recent months. Obviously, 2 percent
growth is not the new normal for the
American economy. We all ought to be
relieved and comforted by that fact.
The unemployment rate has dropped
to 3.6 percent—the lowest level in near-
ly half a century. Everybody who is
able-bodied and willing to work and
willing to be trained for jobs that pay
well I believe has an opportunity to do
so these days. There is no doubt that
this is an incredible time for our econ-
omy, and I am confident that the pro-
growth policies that we have brought
to the table during this administration
and during a Republican majority in
the House and the Senate will continue
to bring real benefits to families across
the country. But we have also broken
another record, one that has a much
more negative impact, and that is espe-
cially in my State of Texas.
S. 1303
In March, Customs and Border Pro-
tection encountered more than 103,000
migrants along the southwestern bor-
der—the highest number since 2007. Un-
like previous times when we saw num-
bers on that scale, these are people who
simply show up at the border and turn
themselves in to the Border Patrol and
claim asylum—mainly families and un-
accompanied children, if you could be-
lieve that. To put this figure into per-
spective, it is more than double that of
the same period last year and more
than six times that in 2017. So some-
thing is clearly afoot.
Our country is simply not equipped
to manage this sort of massive influx,
and folks in my State are bearing the
brunt of the humanitarian crisis.
Again, I would remind those listening
that the first person who called this a
humanitarian crisis, in 2014, was Presi-
dent Barack Obama. He called it a hu-
manitarian and security crisis. It has

gotten worse since then, not better.
Many of our cities along the border and
nongovernmental organizations—faith-
based organizations that take it as
part of their mission to deal with the
needs of migrants along the border—
are struggling to manage the growing
need for humanitarian relief, as well as
businesses and manufacturers that feel
the tight squeeze of backed-up border
crossings.
Most folks here inside the beltway
probably couldn’t comprehend the
cross-border traffic and how inter-
dependent our economy really is. There
are 14,000 to 16,000 truck trips a day
across the U.S.-Mexico border at La-
redo. As the already understaffed Cus-
toms and Border Protection has tried
to manage the flow of family units and
unaccompanied children entering our
country, Customs agents had been
pulled off of that duty—their ordinary
duties—causing lanes to be closed and
wait times to skyrocket. I was told by
some American-based car manufactur-
ers that they simply have had to hire
charter aircraft to fly from the Mexi-
can side of the border to the U.S. side
of the border in order to meet their
just-in-time inventory needs because,
otherwise, trucks bringing those same
parts across the border that ordinarily
would have taken an hour to get across
now are taking 14 hours or more, sim-
ply disrupting their supply chain and
threatening to put many people in the
interior of the United States out of
work if this situation continues or gets
worse.
The aerial footage of the border looks
more like a parking lot than a port of
entry. Cargo trucks and personal vehi-
cles sit at a complete standstill,
backed up for miles. People are sup-
plying drivers with water. Can you
imagine being stuck in your car for
hours on end with no preparation for
food or water—or fuel, for that mat-
ter—based on the amount of time sit-
ting idly in line?
With nearly $1.7 billion in products
crossing our border every day, as I
have said, these delays have had a seri-
ous impact on manufacturers and re-
tailers in industries ranging from auto-
mobiles to medical devices to just sim-
ply the produce that we take for grant-
ed in our grocery stores.
A report released last week by the
Texas-based Perryman Group esti-
mated that these slowdowns could cost
the U.S. economy $69 billion—$69 bil-
lion—over a 3-month period. Nearly
half of that—an estimated $32 billion—
would be a direct hit on the Texas
economy.
Last week, I heard from the Chamber
of Commerce in San Antonio and the
Hispanic Chamber of Commerce about
these wait times. Their members are
facing delayed orders and increased
shipping costs because of these wait
times, and they want us to do some-
thing about it. That is not an unrea-
sonable desire or request.
Unlike a lot of folks inside the belt-
way here in Washington, they have to
manage this crisis. They have to deal
with it. They can’t ignore it or turn
their eyes in another direction. They
don’t care about talking points or win-
ning a messaging war. They want a so-
lution to their problem. So, now, in ad-
dition to the humanitarian and secu-
rity crisis that President Obama talked
about in 2014, we have the beginning of
a full-blown economic crisis as well.
It is an understatement to say that
there is a lot of disagreement on what
the solution might look like, but any-
one who has taken an elementary
school class can tell you that, for it to
pass a Republican-led Senate and a
Democratic-controlled House, this
must be bipartisan. I should say that
anybody who has happened to see
‘‘Schoolhouse Rock!’’ should know that
it is going to have to be bipartisan and
bicameral and that the President has
to sign it in order for it to pass.
Over the years, I have worked closely
with my friend and fellow Texan HENRY
CUELLAR on legislation to strengthen
both border security and customs oper-
ations along our State’s border with
Mexico. HENRY is a Democrat from La-
redo, TX. I, obviously, am not, but that
doesn’t mean we can’t find common
background. That is actually what I
believe our constituents sent us here to
do—not to sacrifice principles but,
when there is a problem to be solved,
to work together in a bipartisan way to
try to solve it. So last week, we intro-
duced a bill that could bring those rec-
ordbreaking border numbers back down
and finally provide some relief for law
enforcement, for our cities, for our
NGOs, and for our businesses strug-
gling to manage.
I have spent a lot of time with the of-
ficers and agents who defend our bor-
ders every day, and I always ask them:
What can I do to help you? What do
you need from Congress in order to suc-
ceed at the job we have asked you to
do?
There are two common answers I
hear. One is to close the loopholes that
serve as a magnet or a pull factor on
this massive wave of humanity from
places like Central America into the
United States, with people claiming
asylum because they know they can ex-
ploit the loopholes that exist in the
law and be successfully placed in the
United States, never to be heard from
again as they blend into this great
American landscape. In other words,
they know they can successfully make
it from here into the United States un-
less these loopholes are filled. That is
what the Border Patrol and Customs
and Border Protection have implored
us to do, along with the Department of
Homeland Security—to close these
loopholes.
The main people benefiting from
these loopholes in our asylum laws are
the human traffickers, the drug traf-
fickers, and the people who get rich
moving this massive humanity from
Central America into the United
States. They charge, $5,000, $6,000,
$7,000, or $8,000 a person. Of course,
these are also the same criminal orga-
nizations that move drugs into the
United States, trafficking women and
children for sex.
Last year alone, we know that 70,000-
plus Americans died of drug overdoses
in America. About half of them was
from opioids, including heroin—90 per-
cent of which comes from Mexico—
along with the synthetic opioid known
as fentanyl, which those of us working
here know is much more powerful and
much more dangerous than heroin,
which is dangerous in and of itself. The
same people who are trafficking in
these migrants are trafficking in the
drugs that are killing Americans on a
daily basis and taking advantage of the
desire of women and children to make
their way here to the United States
and turning them into virtual sex
slaves.
The people who have patiently and
properly tried to enter our country le-
gally are frustrated by illegal border
crossers who try to game the system
and use well-intentioned laws as a lit-
eral get-out-of-jail-free card.
One of the most frequently exploited
loopholes is known as the Flores Set-
tlement Agreement, which was created
to ensure that unaccompanied children
aren’t spending long periods of time in
the custody of the Border Patrol. It
was and remains an important pro-
tector for the most vulnerable individ-
uals who come across our border and
ensures that these unaccompanied chil-
dren may be processed and released ei-
ther to relatives or to the Department
of Health and Human Services.
A later, misguided ruling by the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016
effectively expanded the time cap for
unaccompanied children to families—
that is, adults bringing one or more
children across the border with them.
These smugglers and human traffickers
aren’t fools. They see this as an oppor-
tunity to be exploited, and they know
that by posing as a family, these indi-
viduals will be released after 20 days
and can virtually disappear into the in-
terior of the country. The child trav-
eling with them could have been kid-
napped, smuggled, or trafficked—all of
which has happened before.
Sadly, this is a common occurrence.
The Department of Human Resources
announced last week that they have
identified more than 1,000 cases of
fraudulent families trying to cross the
border since October of last year.
Clearly, the criminal element is ex-
ploiting our laws and hurting innocent
children, and by doing nothing, we our-
selves are complicit in their bad behav-
ior.
That is why we need to act. That is
the one thing we can do. We need to
clarify that Flores only applies to un-
accompanied children and not to these
family units who are gaming the sys-
tem. First and foremost, this would
protect children from being used as an
entry ticket by criminals and smug-
glers, and it would also eliminate a
pull factor for those tempted to try to
use this method to gain entry.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2628 May 6, 2019
Of course, we know there are legiti-
mate families who cross our border,
and we must take additional steps to
confirm these biological relationships
and enable them to remain together in
custody. No one is advocating for sepa-
rating these families from their chil-
dren. The HUMANE Act that Congress-
man CUELLAR and I have introduced re-
quires all children to undergo biomet-
ric and DNA screening—something the
Department of Homeland Security has
recently been testing. This was in
order to defeat the fraudulent claim of
biological or familial relationship with
a minor child in order to gain entry
into the United States. I believe we
have a responsibility to ensure that
children are actual family members
and not being used as a pawn by the
smugglers.
Our legislation also provides safe-
guards to prevent children from being
placed in the custody of dangerous in-
dividuals, such as sex offenders or
human traffickers. The last thing we
should want to do is welcome these un-
accompanied children here to America,
only to place them, by action of the
Federal Government, in the hands of
sex offenders or human traffickers be-
cause of our failure to take all nec-
essary caution to prevent it.
Consistent with the recommenda-
tions from the bipartisan Department
of Homeland Security Homeland Secu-
rity Advisory Council, the HUMANE
Act would require DHS to establish at
least four regional processing centers
along the southern border to house and
process these families. It is important
that we provide them humane and com-
passionate housing while they await
their asylum hearing in front of an im-
migration judge.
By not doing so, by engaging in what
has come to be known as catch-and-re-
lease, we essentially help facilitate the
entry of these individuals into the
United States and encourage this pull
factor that would only encourage not
only 76,000 migrants, like we saw come
across the border in February, not
103,000, like we saw come across the
border in March, but we are going to
see those numbers continue to go up
and up and up and up, because, if you
think about it, there is simply no rea-
son for them not to come. The smug-
glers are getting rich, and people who
want to come into the United States by
falsely claiming grounds for asylum
have found a way to exploit our sys-
tem. When we look in the mirror, the
only ones we can blame are ourselves
for failing to act.
We know these regional processing
centers could serve as a one-stop shop,
with DHS personnel, including asylum
officers, on site to adjudicate claims
and expedite the entire process. We
want to make sure that if somebody
does have a bona fide claim for asylum,
they get to be heard by an immigration
judge and they get that immigration
benefit to which the law entitles them.
But if they are not entitled to asylum,
if they can’t make their case to an im-
migration judge, they should not be
able to do an end run around the sys-
tem and enter the country under false
pretenses.
These central processing centers
would also provide families with better
living conditions that can be provided
at a CBP detention facility meant to
hold strictly single adults.
To prevent this humanitarian crisis
from having a deeper impact on legiti-
mate trade and travel, this bill man-
dates the hiring of additional Home-
land Security personnel and upgrades
our ports of entry to expedite the legal
movement of people and goods.
Just the binational trade with Mex-
ico supports about 5 million jobs in
America; with Canada, another 8 mil-
lion. That is why the North American
Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, is
so important, and now that it has been
supplanted by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada
agreement that we will be taking up
soon, it is very important for us to
keep legitimate commerce and trade
flowing between Mexico, Canada, and
the United States because 13 million
jobs or more in America depend on that
binational trade. That is another col-
lateral piece of damage as a result of
this humanitarian crisis as well.
This is an opportunity for us to con-
sider a bipartisan and bicameral piece
of legislation to solve a real and grow-
ing problem, and I hope both of our
Chambers will take seriously our re-
sponsibility to act and to act soon.

TRIBUTE TO MIKE ENZI
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
over the weekend, our friend the distin-
guished Senator from Wyoming, Mr.
ENZI, announced that he wouldn’t seek
reelection. It is no secret that Senator
ENZI and I approach legislation from
two very different standpoints, but I
have always found him to be thought-
ful and decent—qualities that have
made him a good Senator and a re-
spected voice for the people of Wyo-
ming.
When Senator ENZI was elected, he
was this Chamber’s only accountant by
trade. Perhaps it is destiny, then, that
he will end his tenure at the top of the
Budget Committee. Despite his promi-
nent perch and decades in Washing-
ton’s corridors of power, Senator ENZI
still retains the accountant’s distaste
for the flashy. He eschewed the lime-
light and the television cameras—
something the two of us have in com-
mon. If Senator ENZI will forgive me
that joke, I would like to wish him and
his family the best in all his future en-
deavors—that is, of course, after he
concludes his final year and a half in
Washington as one of Wyoming’s long-
est serving Senators.
MUELLER REPORT
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, in the aftermath of Attorney Gen-
eral Barr’s testimony before the Judi-
ciary Committee, it is now clearer than
ever that the Senate must hear from
Special Counsel Mueller. We need Spe-
cial Counsel Mueller to testify because,
as we have seen, the Attorney General
has shown us he cannot be trusted on
the matter of the Russia investigation.
After the special counsel delivered
his findings, the Attorney General took
a 480-page document and turned it into
4 pages, producing a document so inad-
equate that it even prompted the spe-
cial counsel to raise concerns in writ-
ing—the normally very reticent special
counsel, I might add. Meanwhile, the
Attorney General has speculated, with-
out evidence, about the special coun-
sel’s reasonings, and he has done so, we
have now learned, without having re-
viewed any of the underlying evidence.
To make matters worse, Mr. Barr also
refused to appear before the House Ju-
diciary Committee, demonstrating his
contempt for the oversight responsibil-
ities of Congress.
The bottom line is this: The Attor-
ney General’s word cannot be the end
of the matter. Special Counsel Mueller
must testify. Unfortunately, however,
the chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee has thus far been far less
than welcoming, and now the President
has made it clear that he believes
Mueller should not testify.
I want to remind this Chamber that
President Trump repeatedly tried to
fire the special counsel, then he called
the special counsel conflicted and cor-
rupted and refused to be interviewed by
him, and now he is trying to silence
the special counsel completely. For a
man who constantly proclaims his in-
nocence and the ‘‘exoneration’’ of the
Mueller report, President Trump sus-
piciously objects to Special Counsel
Mueller’s public testimony.
Thankfully, Congress isn’t subject to
the will of the President. My friend
Senator GRAHAM has an obligation to
ask the special counsel to testify with-
out constraints. I will continue to
press him to call for a hearing.
PUERTO RICO
Finally, Mr. President, we have been
trying for weeks now to come up with
a package of disaster assistance for
Americans impacted by fires and floods
and typhoons and hurricanes that
would be acceptable to my friends on
the other side of the aisle. Meanwhile,
the President continues to wage a bi-
zarre and fact-impaired campaign
against millions of American citizens
living in Puerto Rico.
This morning, the President claimed
incredibly that Puerto Rico has re-
ceived $91 billion in recovery funds

while other States have been left be-
hind. That defies the facts. He also sug-
gested that Puerto Rico should be
thankful for the funding they have al-
ready received and accused Democrats
of selling out other parts of the coun-
try. There is a lot to unpack there, so
here it goes.
For one, Puerto Rico has not re-
ceived $91 billion—not even close. At
most, Puerto Rico has received $11 bil-
lion while billions more, already allo-
cated by the Congress—Democrats and
Republicans—are being withheld by the
Trump administration itself. Just last
week, the administration missed a self-
imposed deadline to advance the re-
lease of $8 billion in funding to help the
island rebuild and prepare for future
disasters.
Second, it is galling even by the
President’s standards to say that Puer-
to Rico should be thankful for disaster
aid. The President hasn’t said that Ala-
bama should be thankful for disaster
aid. He hasn’t said that Texas should
be thankful or Florida or the Caro-
linas. But for some reason, the Presi-
dent implies that aid to Puerto Rico is
some kind of favor he is doing. I re-
mind the President that helping parts
of our country recover from natural
disasters is not a favor; it is what we
do as Americans and what we have al-
ways done until the President’s heavy
hand disrupted the legislation that
Democrats and Republicans had crafted
and were prepared to pass.
When a natural disaster strikes one
corner of the country, Americans put
politics aside and come together to
help each other out. The President,
however, is failing our fellow citizens
in Puerto Rico and all those rebuilding
their lives and communities after dis-
aster.
For those here who say ‘‘Well, let’s
just pass this bill now,’’ the House
won’t pass this bill. The House will not
pass a bill without full aid to Puerto
Rico, and neither will this Chamber.
So what are we talking about here?
We are talking about a President who
came in and for some reason didn’t
want to give aid to Puerto Rico while
giving to everywhere else even though
Puerto Rico’s disaster probably, per
capita, affected them worse than any
other State. They are American citi-
zens, I would remind the President.
Now he is bolloxing the whole thing up.
Both sides here in Congress—Demo-
crats and Republicans who believe in
aid—ought to disavow the President’s
decision and pass relief for all Ameri-
cans affected by natural disasters—all
Americans. Democrats are ready to
support disaster relief for every corner
in this country—the west coast, the
Midwest, the South, and Puerto Rico.
As our negotiators continue to make
progress on a disaster package, I fer-
vently hope we come to a resolution
very soon.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa.
MUELLER REPORT
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President,
the taxpayers spent $30 million on the
special counsel’s investigation. Now we
know without a single doubt that there
was no collusion by the Trump cam-
paign with Russia. For more than 2
years, the Democrats screamed collu-
sion and did so not based on fact but
based on rumor, hearsay, and probably
wishful thinking. They have done a
huge disservice to the American people
by taking that approach.
As I have said before, the real collu-
sion was actually with the Democrats.
Here is how it has evolved. It was the
Clinton campaign and Democratic Na-
tional Committee that hired Fusion
GPS to do opposition research against
Candidate Trump. Then Fusion GPS
hired Christopher Steele, a former
British intelligence officer, to compile
what we now hear always referred to as
the Steele dossier. That document was
very central to the fake collusion nar-
rative, and it reportedly used Russian
Government sources for information.
So the Democrats paid for a document
created by a foreign national that re-
lied on Russian Government sources—
not Trump; the Democrats. That is the
definition of collusion.
But Democratic collusion didn’t stop
there. Last week, The Hill newspaper
reported that a Democratic National
Committee contractor contacted the
Ukrainian Government to get dirt on
the Trump and Manafort during the
Presidential election. Specifically, the
Democratic National Committee con-
tractor reportedly ‘‘wanted to collect
evidence that Trump, his organization
and Manafort were Russian assets
working to hurt the U.S. and working
with Putin against U.S. interests.’’
The Democrats were up in arms
about the Trump Tower meeting when
the Trump campaign was approached
about dirt on Hillary Clinton. Here, the
DNC proactively pounded the door of a
foreign government for dirt. Where is
the outrage at that? The special coun-
sel ignored all of that in his report;
thus, he didn’t fulfill all of his respon-
sibilities.
The Deputy Attorney General ap-
pointed Mueller in May of 2017 to inves-
tigate alleged collusion between the
Trump campaign and Russia during the
2016 election. The Deputy Attorney
General further ordered that if the spe-
cial counsel believed it was necessary
and appropriate, he was authorized to
‘‘prosecute federal crimes arising from
the investigation of these matters.’’
But that is not what the special coun-
sel did on the obstruction question. In-
stead, the special counsel declined to
make a traditional prosecutorial deci-
sion. The report said that ‘‘[t]he evi-
dence that we obtained about the
President’s actions and intent presents
difficult issues that prevent us from
conclusively determining that no
criminal conduct occurred.’’
As the Attorney General said when
he released the report and then again
in his testimony before the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee last week, the role
of a prosecutor ‘‘is to make a charging
decision.’’ It isn’t a prosecutor’s job to
exonerate a subject; it is to charge a
crime or, in the alternative, not to
charge a crime. But in his report, the
special counsel explains his decision
not to even make a decision. He says,
among other things, that stating the
President had committed a chargeable
offense without actually charging him,
under the Justice Department’s guid-
ance, would be unfair to the President
because, according to the special coun-
sel, then the President couldn’t defend
himself properly before a neutral
factfinder. Instead, the special counsel
laid out 200 or so pages of facts and
hand-wringing relating to the obstruc-
tion and then dumped all of this mate-
rial on the Attorney General’s desk.
It reminds me of former FBI Director
Comey’s declaration in the summer of
2016 that Secretary Clinton was ex-
tremely careless in handling classified
information but that no reasonable
prosecutor would bring a case against
Secretary Clinton. FBI Director Comey
made a prosecutorial decision that
wasn’t his to make; it was up to the
Attorney General to make. That was
Attorney General Lynch. Comey also
released derogatory information about
Secretary Clinton and then refused to
show all of his work.
The special counsel’s report is at
least equally problematic. The report
lays out 200 pages of investigative
product but leaves the charging deci-
sion hanging in Never Never Land.
Nevertheless, the report asserts that if
the special counsel team could have
found the President did not commit ob-
struction, they would have said so.
But, again, that is not what prosecu-
tors do. That is a reversal of the inno-
cent until proven guilty standard that
is basic to American justice. If it really
were a thorough investigation, it seems
the inverse would be true as well. The
inverse is that, after a thorough inves-
tigation, the special counsel did not
have enough evidence to conclusively
state obstruction actually occurred.
During the Attorney General’s May 1
testimony before the Senate Judiciary
Committee, he noted that if the special
counsel found facts sufficient to con-
stitute obstruction, he would have
stated that finding.
Curiously, the special counsel spilled
a lot of ink in his report to explain why
he believed the President could be
charged as a matter of legal theory. So
why didn’t he just make that decision
or at least make a very clear rec-
ommendation to the Attorney General
and stand behind his own theories?
The Attorney General and the Dep-
uty Attorney General asked Mueller
whether he would have charged ob-
struction but for the Department’s
guidance on charging sitting Presi-
dents. The special counsel said no,
which means, if warranted, that there
was no barrier for him to make that
charge.
In the absence of a decision from the
special counsel, it was then up to the

Attorney General and the Deputy At-
torney General, who appointed Mueller
and supervised his work. The Attorney
General and the Deputy Attorney Gen-
eral reviewed all of the facts and evi-
dence that the special counsel col-
lected. The Attorney General and the
Deputy Attorney General evaluated it
under Mueller’s own legal theories,
even though they disagreed with some
of those theories. After all of that, the
Attorney General and the Deputy At-
torney General determined that the
evidence was not sufficient to charge.
Oddly, the special counsel’s report is
probably the most notable for what it
doesn’t address at all.
The special counsel’s report does not
address the genesis of the Russia inves-
tigation. It doesn’t address whether the
FBI used improper surveillance tech-
niques on the Trump campaign or indi-
viduals associated with the Trump
campaign. It doesn’t address the credi-
bility of the FBI’s sources.
It doesn’t address whether the Steele
dossier was a Russian disinformation
campaign. Even one of the reporters at
the publication that initially dumped
the dossier into the public domain
wants to know where it came from and
what it means. The special counsel’s
report doesn’t address whether Depart-
ment of Justice officials turned a blind
eye to potential misconduct. It also
doesn’t address whether the Depart-
ment of Justice misled the Foreign In-
telligence Surveillance Court when it
applied for that court’s decision
against the Trump campaign.
So now we know what reasonable
people have long suspected—there was
no collusion and no obstruction of the
collusion investigation. Yet we still
don’t know how this so-called collusion
investigation got started in the first
place.
In March 2017, then-FBI Director
James Comey testified that he briefed
President-elect Trump about these al-
legations in January 2017 even though,
according to his public testimony, Di-
rector Comey considered them to be, in
his words, ‘‘salacious and unverified.’’
If, in fact, they were salacious and
unverified in early 2017, then what were
they months before that when Comey
started the investigation? We know the
allegations against Page were
unverified when they were used by the
FBI and the Justice Department to
support a FISA application to spy—
yes, spy—on an American citizen, an
American citizen who, by the way, has
never been charged with anything.
In January of 2018, Senator LINDSEY
GRAHAM and this Senator wrote to the
Deputy Attorney General and FBI Di-
rector Christopher Wray about the al-
legations in the Steele dossier, about
its author, and, more importantly,
about its bankrollers. In that memo,
we described inconsistencies between
what Steele swore to a British court
about his contacts with the media and
what the Page FISA application rep-
resented to the FISA Court about those
same contacts. The FISA application
represented that Steele did not com-
municate with the media about his in-
telligence reports but that he told the
British court he did.
We noted in our memo that if Mr.
Steele had lied to the FBI about his
media contacts, it would bear on his
credibility. That would be a huge prob-
lem because the FISA application and
its renewals depended on taking Steele
at his word. Remember, at that time,
the Steele dossier was still ‘‘salacious
and unverified,’’ and those were
Comey’s words. So it mattered a whole
lot whether the FBI and the Depart-
ment of Justice could trust Steele and
his dossier.
In our referral, Senator GRAHAM and
I also noted that Mr. Steele’s contacts
with the media likely affected, in our
words, the ‘‘reliability of his informa-
tion-gathering efforts’’ in compiling
the dossier. By the time the Depart-
ment of Justice and the FBI filed the
FISA application and even before the
FBI officially opened the investigation,
the Steele dossier was probably the
worst kept secret in Washington, DC.
The same can be said for the govern-
ment’s efforts to look for ties between
the Trump campaign and Russia. All of
these folks—the media, lawyers, lobby-
ists, campaign organizations, private
research firms, FBI officials, the De-
partment of Justice and Department of
State officials, and even foreign intel-
ligence agencies—reportedly had access
to the dossier information or the dos-
sier itself. An attorney for Clinton and
the Democratic National Committee
even passed on some aspects of this in-
formation directly to the FBI’s general
counsel before the FISA was issued.
Basically, this piece of paper was, in
some form or another, all over this
town, and the more the dossier was
shopped around, the more vulnerable it
became to its manipulation.
We also know that at least as early
as the summer of 2016, foreign intel-
ligence agencies were reportedly feed-
ing information to the CIA about
Trump campaign associates and that
the FBI was using a source to seek in-
formation from individuals who were
associated with the Trump campaign.
At about that time, Fusion GPS had
hired Steele on behalf of the Clinton
campaign and the Democratic National
Committee.
We need to know if leadership in the
intelligence community and the FBI
were already gathering intelligence on
Trump associates when Fusion hired
Steele. We need to know whether the
Obama administration was looking so
hard for connections that it figured the
Steele dossier would justify efforts to
continue its surveillance activities.
Further, we need to know if the Rus-
sians knew our government was that
hungry for information to the point
they packed the dossier with
disinformation just to sow chaos. If so,
it looks like the Obama administration
fell for it hook, line, and sinker, and it
certainly seems like some in leadership
may have ignored clear warning signs.
Department of Justice official Bruce
Ohr spoke with top FBI leadership
about Steele’s work the day the inves-
tigation opened, and after the FBI ter-
minated Steele as a source, Ohr contin-
ued to feed Steele’s work to the Bu-
reau. At various times, Mr. Ohr made
it clear to the FBI that the informa-
tion from Steele could not be taken at
face value because it was based on
hearsay. Ohr noted that Steele had an
anti-Trump agenda and that the whole
operation was bankrolled by Clinton
and the Democratic National Com-
mittee. Of course, the Clinton cam-
paign wasn’t keen on the world’s know-
ing it was footing the bill for the dos-
sier. Its lawyers even lied to the media
about this fact for more than a year.
That is not my saying it. A New York
Times reporter said that.
So, by the time the FISA application
was filed and every time it was re-
newed, FBI and Department of Justice
leaders were very much aware of the
political bias and the purpose of the
unverified information that supposedly
supported it, so much so that according
to reported text messages between
former FBI Deputy Director Andrew
McCabe and his staff, the FBI worked
to create—these are their words—a
‘‘robust explanation’’ for ‘‘any possible
bias’’ of the source ‘‘in the package’’
supporting the FISA application. It
also seems from these text messages
that the FBI was getting pushback
from at least one individual at the Jus-
tice Department about seeking the
FISA.
In the end, the FISA application was
presented to the court with there being
no mention whatsoever of Clinton, the
Democratic National Committee, or
any mention of the source’s political
bias and with only mere speculation by
the FBI that its primary source was
not peddling his information far and
wide. The FISA application was then
granted by the court and was renewed
three times. Let me say that again.
The FISA application was granted and
renewed three times.
The FBI surveilled an American cit-
izen for many months based on sala-
cious and unverified information that
had been gathered by a former foreign
intelligence officer who was desperate
to keep the President out of office. He
was British Agent Steele. That former
intelligence officer used Russian
sources, including Russian Government
sources, at the behest and with the
funding of a rival political party and
campaign.
The Democrats and the mainstream
media have been screaming at the top
of their lungs about salacious,
unverified allegations that this Presi-
dent stole an election by working with
the Russians, but it is a sobering and
verified fact that the Democrats actu-
ally paid for dirt from the Russians to
damage their political opponents.
So now, after the taxpayers have
spent $30 million to work through this
swirling cesspool of allegations, when

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2631
May 6, 2019
the Attorney General says he has con-
cerns about certain aspects of this in-
vestigation, I agree with him. I don’t
know whether laws were broken or pro-
tocols were breached or rules were vio-
lated, but for decades, I have been
doing oversight of the Federal Govern-
ment, including of the Department of
Justice and the FBI, and I think there
is certainly enough there to be asking
questions.
For example, did the Obama adminis-
tration improperly use the U.S. intel-
ligence community to attempt to neu-
tralize and denigrate a political oppo-
nent? Did the Obama administration
fail to properly assert oversight of the
Department of Justice and the FBI
FISA process?
These questions must be answered.
It is fundamentally American to care
not just about what laws the govern-
ment enforces but also how the govern-
ment enforces those laws.
If the greatest enemy we see is the
person on the other side of the political
spectrum, then the foreign powers who
seek to divide and weaken our Republic
are going to succeed.
Now, I have been trying to get to the
bottom of all sides of this issue for
years, and I have urged my Democratic
colleagues to join me.
I am encouraged that the Attorney
General is taking a look, and I am en-
couraged that the independent Depart-
ment of Justice inspector general has
been looking at these issues as well. I
have no idea what they are going to
find.
I know Mueller turned a blind eye to
what they are investigating, however.
The American people need answers—all
the answers.
It is not just this administration that
has been dragged through the mud with
wild collusion and obstruction theo-
ries. The American people have had to
listen to those falsehoods now for
years. Many in the media have been
breathlessly flooding the airwaves with
speculation and what-ifs about the
bogus Trump collusion narrative.
Now that the report is out, some
media figures are still struggling to
come to terms with Mueller’s findings
and decisions. It is as if they are un-
happy with the results or perhaps they
are embarrassed that the world is
learning that we have been sold a
bunch of snake oil for the past 2 years
and now they are finding out that the
jig is up.
I hope the mainstream media will
pursue the origins of the Russian collu-
sion investigation and do it with the
same vigor as they have been pushing
the collusion narrative for the last 2
years, and there ought to be some
apologies from some of them. This
would all go a long way to restoring
their damaged credibility.
So I am going to do whatever I can to
make sure the people get these an-

REMEMBERING GENIE ZAVALETA
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in 1958,
recently married Genie Zavaleta went
on assignment with the Migrant Min-
istry with her husband Hector. They
traveled the country to support Mexi-
can migrant workers. Genie was a child
of the Great Depression, and she knew
when people needed help. What was
supposed to be a 1-year stint became a
lifetime of helping people in need.
Last month, Genie passed away at
the age of 92. She was known as the
grandmother of the Dreamers. She was
a longtime champion and mentor to
undocumented youth in Arizona and a
fierce advocate for the Dream Act.
Genie also was my ally in defending
the Dreamers.
In 1965, Genie and Hector moved to
Arizona permanently with their two
sons, Dan and David. Arizona was a
transforming State, and the influx of
migrant workers attracted Genie. She
became the first director of education
at Planned Parenthood of Phoenix,
teaching classes on poverty and across
the county. She taught classes at
Phoenix College and Arizona State
University too. She worked with the

for 15 years until her retirement in
1989.
Genie’s retirement was not close to
the end of her story. She moved into
full-time advocacy for immigrants. For
more than a decade, my staff and I
worked with her on behalf of Dreamers.
She saved countless Dreamers from
being deported. Genie had my office on
speed dial. She frequently alerted us to
Dreamers at the risk of deportation.
She shared stories of Dreamers that I
told on the Senate floor.
In 2011, I organized the Dream Sab-
bath, a gathering of faith communities
around the country to put a human
face on the plight of undocumented
students. An event about the Dream
Act would never be complete without
Genie’s participation, so of course, she
helped organize Arizona’s Dream Sab-
bath.
Genie did not seek fanfare. She quiet-
ly became one of Arizona’s most influ-
ential immigration activists. She did
not want fame. It was about the
Dreamers.
On the lawn of her home in Arizona,
there once were signs covering the
whole area for the causes she sup-
ported. Today, the house is quiet, and
the lawn is empty except one sign, a
stars-and-stripes one with ‘‘In our
America, all people are equal’’ at the
top. We will keep fighting on Genie’s
behalf until the Dream Act is the law
of the land.
Genie Zavaleta is survived by her
husband Hector, her sons Dan and
David, and their wives Nori and Linda.
On behalf of the hundreds of people she
helped, Loretta and I send our sincere
condolences.

bility, global security.
Corruption erodes trust and con-
fidence in democratic institutions, the
rule of law, and human rights protec-
tions. It damages America’s global
competitiveness and creates barriers to
economic growth in international mar-
kets. It threatens our national and
international security by fostering the
conditions for violent extremism and
weakening institutions associated with
governance and accountability. As
Transparency International noted in
its 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index
published this January, failure to curb
corruption is contributing to a world-
wide crisis of democracy. According to
Freedom House, in 2017, democracy
faced its most serious crisis in decades
and marked the 12th consecutive year
of decline in global freedom.
We have all seen the headlines, from
scandals in Liberia, Hungary, and Gua-
temala, to the doping by Russian ath-
letes and their subsequent ban from
the 2016 Summer Olympics, to the Pan-
ama Papers. It is clear that where
there are high levels of corruption we
find fragile states, authoritarian
states, or states suffering from internal
or external conflict, in places such as
Afghanistan and Pakistan, Iraq, Syria,
Somalia, Nigeria, and Sudan.
The problem of corruption and the
dysfunction that follows it can be dif-
ficult to address because it is like a
hydra, with many corrupt actors that
can include government officials, busi-
nessmen, law enforcement, military
personnel, and organized criminal
groups. Corruption is a system that op-
erates via extensive, entrenched net-
works in both the public and private
sectors. It is ubiquitous and pervasive.
We must address it. We can’t throw
up our hands and accept corruption as
the status quo because the costs of not
addressing and rooting it out are too
great. Corruption fuels violent extre-
mism, pushing young people toward vi-
olence, because they lose faith in the
institutions that are supposed to pro-
tect and serve them. Corruption feeds
the destructive fire of criminal net-
works and transnational crime. Citi-
zens lose faith in the social compact
between governments and the people.
Terrorist groups use corruption to re-
cruit followers to their hateful cause.
It is a vicious cycle.
The human cost of corruption is sub-
stantial. Across the globe, millions of
men, women, and children are victims
of modern day slavery. Corruption en-
ables their trafficking within and
among countries. Corruption is a con-
stant companion to modern day slav-
ery and the suffering that it brings. We
also have seen this play out in the ref-
ugee and migrant crisis, with thou-
sands drowning in the Mediterranean,
victims of trafficking networks and
corrupt government officials who fa-
cilitate this illicit business. Make no
mistake, corruption is big business.
UNICEF estimates that human traf-
fickers generate $32 billion in profits
by smuggling 21 million men, women,
and children through corrupt networks
every year.
Let’s be clear-eyed: Any fight against
corruption will be long-term and dif-
ficult. It is a fight against powerful
people, powerful companies, and power-
ful interests. It is about changing a
mindset and a culture as much as it is
about establishing and enforcing laws.
As my colleagues and constituents
know, my attention has long been fo-
cused on fighting corruption. I was
proud to sponsor the Global Magnitsky
Human Rights Accountability Act with
our late colleague Senator John
McCain, an unwavering enemy of cor-
ruption throughout the globe. That bi-
partisan bill was enacted into law in
late 2016, and I applaud the Trump ad-
ministration for aggressively using the
act to target human rights abusers and
corrupt individuals around the globe
who threaten the rule of law and deny
fundamental freedoms, but the problem
of corruption is enormous; we simply
must do more.
I want to briefly discuss something
that is hard to capture in legislation.
It is something that I grappled with
when drafting this bill. It is something
that perhaps, more than anything, will
dictate if we win this struggle against
corruption. That is bipartisan political
will, which as so critical in advancing
the Global Magnitsky Act. Global
Magnitsky took several years to enact
because some in Congress, as well as
some Obama administration officials,
were concerned about the political and
practical ramifications of the bill.
Another example of the impact of a
lack of political will on fighting cor-
ruption is particularly salient this
week, as we mourn the passing of our
dear colleague, former Senator Richard
Lugar. In 2010, Senator Lugar and I
were able to get one of the most power-
ful anti-corruption and antipoverty
laws enacted.
Senator Lugar and I worked on the
bill that would become section 1504 of
the Dodd-Frank Act, known as the
‘‘Cardin-Lugar provision,’’ for several
years. Over the course of our tenures
on Foreign Relations Committee, we
had seen clear evidence that secrecy
breeds corruption and that corruption
can breed instability and perpetuate
poverty in resource-rich countries. The
Cardin-Lugar provision requires that
all foreign and domestic companies
listed on U.S. stock exchanges and in-
volved in oil, gas, and mineral resource
extraction must publish the project-
level payments they make to the for-
eign countries in which they operate.
The enactment of this provision was a
watershed moment in which the United
States reclaimed its position as a lead-
er in the effort to increase global ac-
countability and transparency. It took
6 years for the Securities and Exchange
Commission to finally issue a rule to
implement the law—6 years. That is
the length of a term of a U.S. Senator.
It is college and a master’s degree. It
took 6 years for the United States to
act on this bill. It took that long be-
cause some people believed that less
transparency is a good thing. Some
groups believed that accountability
should take a back seat to profit-
ability. Unfortunately, the rule was re-
pealed by Congress in February 2017.
Congress has a responsibility to reaf-
firm our bipartisan commitment to
combatting corruption not only to
honor the legacies of our late col-
leagues Senator Lugar and Senator

McCain. We also must act to show soli-
darity with the millions of brave
human rights defenders, anti-poverty
advocates, journalists, and investiga-
tors who put their lives at risk every
day—and sometimes pay the ultimate
price—to fight the scourge of corrup-
tion and impunity.
I am proud that last week Senator
YOUNG and I, along with Senators
LEAHY, RUBIO, BLUMENTHAL, and
MERKLEY, reaffirm bipartisan political
will to combat global corruption by re-
introducing the Combating Global Cor-
ruption Act, S. 1309. Our bill makes
clear that the United States must meet
the scale of the problem of corruption
with greater resolve and commitment.
To do that, our bill focuses on four
things.
First, we must institutionalize the
fight against corruption as a national
security priority. Our bill requires the
State Department to produce an an-
nual report, similar to the Trafficking
in Persons Report, which takes a close
look at each country’s efforts to com-
bat corruption. That model, which has
effectively advanced the effort to com-
bat modern day slavery, will similarly
embed the issue of corruption in our
collective work, so that we hold gov-
ernments to account. This bill estab-
lishes minimum standards for com-
bating corruption, standards that
should be part and parcel of every gov-
ernment’s commitment to its citizens.
These include whether a country has
laws that recognize corrupt acts for the
crimes they are—violations of the peo-
ple’s trust—along with appropriate
penalties for breaking that trust,
whether a country has an independent
judiciary for deciding corruption cases,
free from influence and abuse, whether
there is support for civil society orga-
nizations that are the watchdogs of in-
tegrity against would-be thieves of the
state. This bill, hopefully, will build
anticorruption DNA into the founda-
tions of government action.
Second, in the United States, our
whole-of-government effort must be
better coordinated. Right now, we
work across multiple agencies and in
multiple offices to combat corruption.
There is much information and many
best practices that can be shared; we
have got to do better at that and take
advantage of those areas where we
have been successful. The State De-
partment and the United States Agen-
cy for International Development have
done great work, but the vast nature of
the problem requires that we improve
our ability to tackle it. In this bill,
agencies and bureaus and our missions
overseas will have to prioritize corrup-
tion into their strategic planning as an
essential part of our foreign policy
work, a step that I believe will foster
greater cooperation.
Third, we must improve oversight of
our own foreign assistance and pro-
mote transparency. The U.S. taxpayer
has a right to know how our foreign as-
sistance is being spent and also should
feel confident that we are doing the
kind of risk assessments, analysis, and
oversight that ensure our assistance to
other countries is having the effect we
want it to have. Our bill consolidates
information and puts it online, where
citizens can see the numbers and the
programs. That kind of transparency is
in and of itself good, but in my experi-
ence it has the effect of making us bet-
ter at self-policing our work. We can
use the data to capture redundancies
and analyze trends, which I believe will
make our decision-making better. The
bill embeds oversight into our foreign
assistance programs overseas, main-
taining the flexibility we need to meet
our goals rapidly while also holding
government to account.
In fact, it is a natural complement to
the Foreign Assistance Transparency
and Accountability Act, a bipartisan
law Senator RUBIO and I cosponsored
that looks at our foreign aid and seeks
to ensure that our foreign assistance
programs are tracked and evaluated
adequately and appropriately.
I am a believer in the power of exam-
ple. This ‘‘one-two’’ punch of the Com-
bating Global Corruption Act and the
Foreign Assistance Transparency Act
strengthens our foreign assistance pol-
icy, demonstrates that we hold our-
selves to the highest standards, and
shows other countries that we are com-
mitted to this fight.
Finally, we have to find ways to re-
source anti-corruption work. Corrup-
tion is big business and big money. We
should look for ways to use seized as-
sets and ill-gotten proceeds to build
civil society capacity to fight corrup-
tion and make it easier to transfer
these assets to the appropriate effort.
We have also witnessed the damaging
impact of corruption on our foreign as-
sistance efforts. The Combating Global
Corruption Act understands that cor-
ruption risk assessment before, during,
and after the provision of foreign aid
and security assistance is integral to
reducing and eliminating corruption. It
holds U.S. foreign assistance and secu-
rity assistance programs accountable
to U.S. taxpayers by specifying trans-
parency and accountability measures
for the Department of State, the De-
partment of Defense, and the U.S.
Agency for International Development
to advance anti-corruption efforts in
those countries where the U.S. admin-
isters foreign and security assistance.
As we project the American values of
good governance and anticorruption
abroad, we must also redouble our ef-
forts to strengthen these core values
here in the United States. Unfortu-
nately, these values have been put into
question under our current administra-
tion. Our concerns run deeper than no-
ticing the lack of priority given to
anti-corruption and good governance
policies. U.S. credibility has been
weakening on this issue. In turn, our
U.S. foreign policy is threatened.
For the 3rd straight year, the Trump
administration, through its budget re-
quest, sent a message to the world of
its priorities for the United States. For
the 3rd straight year, the Trump ad-
ministration proposed drastic cuts to
the State, Foreign Operations, and Re-
lated Programs—SFOPS—budget,
which would cut foreign assistance
funding by more than 30 percent. This
also came amidst the recent decision
to cut off foreign assistance to the
Northern Triangle of Central America,
a region of the world where U.S. assist-
ance in combating corruption has a di-
rect impact on our national security.
This decision threatens to undermine
the critical anti-corruption program-
ming that helps us combat narcotics
trafficking groups and violent gangs,
as well as to address the root causes of
migration. For this very reason, the bi-
partisan U.S.—Central America strat-
egy names good governance as one of
its central pillars.
This is why for Fiscal Year 2020, I
asked the Senate Appropriations Sub-
committee on State, Foreign Oper-
ations, and Related Programs to in-
clude at least $500,000 for the Depart-
ment of State and $500,000 for the U.S.
Agency for International Development
to achieve meaningful and robust im-
plementation of the activities outlined
in the Combating Global Corruption
Act. This includes the bill’s reporting
requirements, staffing, and staff train-
ing to support anticorruption as a for-
eign policy and development priority.
This bipartisan bill recognizes the im-
portance of combating corruption as a
hurdle to achieving peace, prosperity,
and human rights around the world.
Passage of S. 1309 would signal to the
international community that the U.S.
Congress has not forgotten U.S. values
and that we will continue to fight to
ensure such values and U.S. credibility
remain intact.
There is only one United States of
America. There is only one country
that can do what we can do, and this
bill sends the message that we will con-
tinue to fight to ensure that stature
does not change.
I am under no illusion that this glob-
al fight against corruption will be easy.
It will make the work of our govern-
ment agencies more challenging. It
will make our diplomacy more chal-
lenging. It will require political will,
but political will finds its source and
its strength in our values. Political
will is created when we embrace those
values. Political will endures in good
governance, accountability, and trans-
parency and those values that are at
the core of the compact between the
government and the governed.
As this bill moves forward, I urge my
colleagues to find the political will to
combat global corruption, ensure ac-
countability, and keep our commit-
ment to the best of American values.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION
Bahrain—Patriot Missile System and
Related Support and Equipment
The Government of Bahrain has requested
to buy sixty (60) Patriot Advanced Capa-
bility–3 (PAC–3) Missile Segment Enhance-
ment (MSE) missiles, thirty-six (36) Patriot
MIM–104E Guidance Enhanced Missiles
(GEM–T) missiles with canisters, nine (9)
M903 Launching Stations (LS), five (5) An-
tenna Mast Groups (AMG), three (3) Elec-
trical Power Plants (EPP) III, two (2) AN/
MPQ–65 Radar Sets (RS), and two (2) AN/
MSQ–132 Engagement Control Stations
(ECS). Also included is communications
equipment, tools and test equipment, range
and test programs, support equipment, prime
movers, generators, publications and tech-
nical documentation, training equipment,
spare and repair parts, personnel training,
Technical Assistance Field Team (TAFT),
U.S. Government and contractor technical,
engineering, and logistics support services,
Systems Integration and Checkout (SICO),
field office support, and other related ele-
ments of logistics and program support. The
estimated cost is $2.478 billion.
This proposed sale will support the foreign
policy and national security of the United
States by improving the security of a Major
Non-NATO ally which is a force for political
stability and economic progress in the Mid-
dle East. This sale is consistent with U.S.
initiatives to provide key allies in the region
with modem systems that will enhance
interoperability with U.S. forces and in-
crease security.
The proposed sale will enhance Bahrain’s
interoperability with the United States.
Bahrain will use Patriot to improve its mis-
sile defense capability, defend its territorial
integrity, and deter regional threats. Bah-
rain will have no difficulty absorbing this
system into its armed forces.
The proposed sale of these missiles will not
alter the basic military balance in the re-
gion.
The prime contractor for the PAC–3 Mis-
sile is Lockheed-Martin in Dallas, Texas.
The prime contractor for the GEM–T missile
is Raytheon Company in Andover, Massachu-
setts. There are no known offset agreements
proposed in connection with this potential
sale.
Implementation of this proposed sale will
require approximately 25 U.S. Government
and 40 contractor representatives to travel
to Bahrain for an extended period for equip-
ment de-processing/fielding, system check-
out, training, and technical and logistics
support.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.

Annex Item No. vii
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
1. The Patriot Air Defense System con-
tains classified CONFIDENTIAL hardware
components, SECRET tactical software and
critical/sensitive technology. Patriot ground
support equipment and Patriot missile hard-
ware contain CONFIDENTIAL components
and the associated launcher hardware is UN-
CLASSIFIED. The items requested represent
significant technological advances for Bah-
rain. The Patriot Air Defense System con-
tinues to hold a significant technology lead
over other surface-to-air missile systems in
the world.
2. The Patriot sensitive/critical technology
is primarily in the area of design and produc-
tion know-how and primarily inherent in the
design, development and/or manufacturing
data related to certain components. The list
of components is classified CONFIDENTIAL.
3. Information on system performance ca-
pabilities, effectiveness, survivability, mis-
sile seeker capabilities, select software/soft-
ware documentation and test data are classi-
fied up to and including SECRET.
4. If a technologically advanced adversary
were to obtain knowledge of the hardware
and software elements, the information
could be used to develop countermeasures or
equivalent systems which might reduce sys-
tem effectiveness or be used in the develop-
ment of a system with similar or advanced
capabilities.
5. A determination has been made that the
Government of Bahrain can provide substan-
tially the same degree of protection for the
sensitive technology being released as the
U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in
furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and
national security objectives outlined in the
Policy Justification.
6. All defense articles and services listed in
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of Bah-
rain.

bombs. The PW–II is a maneuverable, free-
fall weapon that guides on laser energy re-
flected off of the target. The PW–II is deliv-
ered like a normal general purpose warhead
and the laser guidance guides the weapon
into the target. Laser designation for the
weapon can be provided by a variety of laser
target designators. The PW–II consists of a
laser guidance kit, a computer control group
and a warhead specific air foil group, that at-
tach to the nose and tail of Mk 84, Mk 82
bomb bodies. The weapon components are
UNCLASSIFIED. Some technical data and
vulnerabilities/countermeasures are classi-
fied up to SECRET.
a. The GBU–10: This is a 2000 lb (BLU–117 B/
B or Mk 84) General Purpose (GP) guided
bomb fitted with the MXU–651 airfoil and the
MAU–169 or MAU–209 computer control group
to guide to its laser-designated target.
b. The GBU–12: This is a 500 lb (BLU–111/B
or Mk–82) guided bomb fitted with the MXU–
650 airfoil and the MAU–169 or MAU 209 com-
puter control group to guide to its laser-des-
ignated target.
6. GBU–49 and GBU–50 are 500 lb/2000 lb En-
hanced Paveway II (EP-II) dual mode laser
and GPS guided munitions respectively. The
GBU–49/50 uses airfoil groups similar to
those used on the GBU–12 and GBU–10 for
inflight maneuverability, and uses a MAU–
210 Enhanced Computer Control Group. The
‘‘enhanced’’ component is the addition of
GPS guidance to the laser seeker. This dual-
mode allows the weapon to operate in all-
weather conditions. Weapons components are
UNCLASSIFIED. Technical data and coun-
termeasures/vulnerabilities are SECRET.
The overall system classification is SE-
CRET.
7. GBU–31 and GBU–38 2000 lb/500 lb Joint
Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) is a guid-
ance kit that converts existing unguided
free-fall bombs into precision-guided muni-
tions. By adding a new tail section con-
taining Inertial Navigation System (INS)
guidance/Global Positioning System (GPS)
guidance to existing inventories of BLU–109,
BLU–111 and BLU–117 or Mk–84 and Mk–82
bombs, the cost effective JDAM provides
highly accurate weapon delivery in any
‘‘flyable’’ weather. The INS, using updates
from the GPS, helps guide the bomb to the
target via the use of movable tail fins. The
JDAM and all of its components are UN-
CLASSIFIED; technical data for JDAM is
classified up to SECRET.
8. GBU–54/56 are the 500 lb/2000 lb Laser
JDAM. These weapons use the DSU–38/B/
DSU–40/42 laser sensor respectively and use
both Global Position System aided inertial
navigation and/or laser guidance to execute
threat targets. The laser sensor enhances
standard JDAM’s reactive target capability
by allowing rapid prosecution of fixed tar-
gets with large initial target location errors
(TLE). The laser sensor also provides the ad-
ditional capability to engage mobile targets.
The addition of the DSU–38 laser sensor com-
bined with additional cabling and mounting
hardware turns a GBU–38 JDAM into a GBU–
54 Laser JDAM. The addition of the DSU–40/
42 laser sensor combined with additional ca-
bling and mounting hardware turns a GBU–31
JDAM into a GBU–56 Laser JDAM. Weapons
components are UNCLASSIFIED. Technical
data and countermeasures/vulnerabilities are
SECRET. The overall system classification
is SECRET.
9. GBU–39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB–1):
The GBU–39 is a 250 lb class precision guided
munition that allows aircraft with an ability
to carry a high number of bombs. The weap-
on offers day or night, adverse weather, pre-
cision engagement capability against pre-
planned fixed or stationary soft, non-hard-
ened, and hardened targets, with a signifi-
cant standoff range. Aircraft are able to
carry four SDB-ls in place of one 2000 lb
bomb. The SDB–1 is equipped with a UPS-
aided inertial navigation system to attack
fixed, stationary targets such as fuel depots
and bunkers. The SDB–1 and all of its compo-
nents are UNCLASSIFIED; technical data is
classified up to SECRET.
10. The AGM–154 Joint Standoff Weapon
(JSOW) is a family of low-cost standoff
weapons that are modular in design and in-
corporate either a sub-munition or a unitary
warhead. Potential targets for JSOW range
from soft targets, such as troop concentra-
tions, to hardened point targets like bunk-
ers. The AGM–154C is a penetrator weapon
that carries a BROACH warhead and pay
load. The AGM–154 hardware, software and
maintenance data is UNCLASSIFIED.
Vulnerabilities and countermeasures are
classified up to SECRET. Overall system
classification is SECRET.
11. The AGM–84L–1 Harpoon provides a day,
night, and adverse weather, standoff air-to-
surface capability. Harpoon Block II is a fol-
low on to the Harpoon missile, which is no
longer in production. Harpoon Block II is an
effective Anti-Surface Warfare missile. The
AGM–84L–1 Harpoon incorporates compo-
nents, software, and technical design infor-
mation that are considered sensitive. The
following Harpoon components being con-
veyed by the proposed sale that are consid-
ered sensitive and are classified CONFIDEN-
TIAL include: IIR seeker, INS, OPP software
and, missile operational characteristics and
performance data. The overall system classi-
fication is SECRET.
12. Software, hardware, and other data/in-
formation, which is classified or sensitive, is
reviewed prior to release to protect system
vulnerabilities, design data, and performance
parameters. Some end-item hardware, soft-
ware, and other data identified above are
classified at the CONFIDENTIAL and SE-
CRET level. Potential compromise of these
systems is controlled through management
of the basic software programs of highly sen-
sitive systems and software-controlled weap-
on systems on a case-by-case basis.
13. If a technologically advanced adversary
were to obtain knowledge of the specific
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system
effectiveness or be used in the development
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities.
14. A determination has been made that
Bahrain can provide substantially the same
degree of protection of this technology as
the U.S. Government. This proposed sale is
necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign
policy and national security objectives out-
lined in the Policy Justification. Moreover,
the benefits to be derived from this sale, as
outlined in the Policy Justification, out-
weigh the potential damage that could result
if the sensitive technology were revealed to
unauthorized persons.
15. All defense articles and services listed
in this transmittal are authorized for release
and export to the Government of Bahrain.
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, section
36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act
requires that Congress receive prior no-
tification of certain proposed arms
sales as defined by that statute. Upon

This proposed sale will support the foreign
policy and national security of the United
States by helping to improve the security of
a NATO partner that is an important force
for ensuring peace and stability in Europe.
The proposed sale will support the Czech Re-
public’s need for its own self-defense and sup-
port NATO defense goals.
The Czech Republic is considering either
the UH–60M or the UH–1Y/AH–1Z to replace
its aging Mi–24 helicopters. The Czech Re-
public intends to use these helicopters to
modernize its armed forces and strengthen
its homeland defense and deter regional
threats. This will contribute to the Czech
Republic’s military goal of updating its ca-
pabilities while further enhancing interoper-
ability with the United States and NATO al-
lies. The Czech Republic will have no dif-
ficulty absorbing these helicopters into its
armed forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment will
not alter the basic military balance in the
region.
The principal contractors will be Sikorsky
Aircraft Company, Stratford, Connecticut;
and General Electric Aircraft Company
(GEAC), Lynn, Massachusetts. There are no
known offset agreements in connection with
this potential sale.

require the assignment of an additional
three U.S. Government and five contractor
representatives in country full-time to sup-
port the delivery and training for approxi-
mately two-five years.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.

Falls, and another 4,500 citizen-soldiers
serve in the National Guard and Re-
serve at various locations across the
State. Beyond the borders of our land-
locked home, more than 2,200 U.S.
Navy sailors currently call Montana
home, adding 134 new Montanans to
their ranks in the past 12 months. Mon-
tana also proudly boasts the highest
percentage of veterans per capita in

A Freedom Class littoral combat
ship, the USS Billings will be among
the fastest, most technologically ad-
vanced, and agile efficient ships in our
naval fleet. The USS Billings will
project power near the shoreline and
conduct a wide range of missions, in-
cluding mine countermeasures, anti-
submarine warfare, and surface warfare
missions. We wait with great anticipa-
tion as her August 3 commissioning
quickly approaches.
In keeping with time-honored naval
traditions, the USS Billings Commis-
sioning Committee on behalf of the
city of Billings is making preparations
to host the commission ceremony and
a series of celebrations. Determined to
accomplish this ambitious goal, the
committee has made great strides in
rallying support across the State. The
city has had the honor and privilege of
hosting the crew of the USS Billings at
the of the committee, and we look for-
ward to their return in the weeks
ahead. These efforts have made great
strides in fostering a strong and endur-
ing relationship between the city of
Billings, the State of Montana, and the
U.S. Navy.
In recognition of these and other no-
table accomplishments, I ask that the
following names who have volunteered
for the USS Billings Commissioning
Committee be entered into the RECORD:
Mayor Bill Cole, Chairman; Council-
man Mike Yakawich, Co-Vice Chair;
Commissioner Denis Pitman, Co-Vice

REMEMBERING DAMON J. KEITH
∑ Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President,
today I wish to pay tribute to the Hon-
orable Damon J. Keith, a civil rights
icon and one of the greatest jurists in
our Nation’s history.
Judge Keith was born on July 4, 1922,
in Detroit, to parents who had relo-
cated from Atlanta so his father could
work for $5 a day in a Ford Motor Com-
pany plant to create a better future for
their family.
Judge Keith’s father encouraged him
to attend college, and he went on to
graduate from West Virginia State Col-
lege, a historically Black college and
university, in 1943. Upon graduation, he
served his country in a segregated
Army unit during World War II.
After his military service, he re-
ceived his J.D. from Howard University
Law School in 1949, passed the Michi-
gan bar in 1950, married Dr. Rachel
Boone in 1953, and received his master
of laws degree from Wayne State Uni-
versity School of Law in 1956.
It was during his time at Howard
when Judge Keith found a mentor in
future Supreme Court Justice
Thurgood Marshall.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2641
May 6, 2019
Justice Marshall told Judge Keith to
‘‘use the law as a means for social
change.’’ That is precisely what Judge
Keith did throughout the Civil Rights
movement, standing up for justice and
equal rights for all citizens.
He spent more than 20 years in pri-
vate practice in Detroit. He served as a
cochair of the Michigan Civil Rights
Commission with John Feikens in 1964
and helped heal the community during
and after the Detroit Uprising of 1967.
That same year, President Lyndon B.
Johnson nominated him to the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District
of Michigan. Judge Keith, a grandson
of slaves, would go on to serve more
than 50 years on the Federal bench, be-
coming the longest serving Black judge
in the nation.
Judge Keith gained national promi-
nence for his ruling against President
Nixon’s Attorney General John N.
Mitchell in the United States v. Sin-
clair case. Judge Keith’s decision was
later upheld by the Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit and the U.S. Su-
preme Court. It is now seen as a land-
mark decision upholding our Fourth
Amendment right against unreasonable
searches and seizures.
In 1971, Judge Keith ordered that
Pontiac, MI, develop a new school bus
policy to help integrate its schools.
Shortly before the order took effect,
five Ku Klux Klansmen firebombed 10
Pontiac school buses and threatened
Judge Keith’s life.
But Judge Keith persisted, ruling in
1975 that the town of Hamtramck must
provide new, affordable housing for 500
African Americans after they were dis-
placed by federally supported urban re-
newal projects. He served as chief judge
from 1975 through 1977.
While serving on the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, Judge
Keith ruled against another President,
this time President George W. Bush’s
secret deportation hearings after 9/11.
Writing for a unanimous panel of
judges, he coined the memorable
phrase ‘‘democracies die behind closed
doors,’’ which inspired the Washington
Post’s motto: ‘‘Democracy Dies in
Darkness.’’
He remained active into his 90s. He
issued a blistering dissent in a Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals voting rights
case in 2016, in which the majority
upheld extremely strict voting require-
ments in Ohio.
Above all, he was a patriot who deep-
ly loved this country. One of his proud-
est roles was serving as the national
chairman of the Commission on the Bi-
centennial of the U.S. Constitution,
when he led efforts to promote the doc-
ument our nation was built upon.
Over the years, he mentored count-
less lawyers, including Michigan’s Sec-
retary of State Jocelyn F. Benson, cir-
cuit court Judge Eric L. Clay, and Lani
Guinier, the first African-American
woman to gain tenure at Harvard Law
School.
Guinier, who served as Judge Keith’s
law clerk, once said this: ‘‘Judge Keith
has been my second father, someone
who presided at my wedding, stood by
me during some of the most difficult
professional challenges of my life, and
guided me with his wisdom,’’ she said.
‘‘And I am far from alone.’’
Professor Guinier is right. With
Judge Keith on their side, the people of
Michigan were never alone. We knew
that we had someone fighting for us
and for justice for all. He used the law
as a means for social change, and I
think Justice Marshall would be very
proud.
My deepest condolences go to his
three daughters, Debbie Keith, Gilda
Keith, and Cecile Keith Brown, his two
granddaughters, and his many friends.∑

RECOGNIZING BUBBLES ICE
CREAM PARLOR
∑ Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, as a
member of the Senate Committee on
Small Business and Entrepreneurship,
it is my privilege to recognize an out-
standing family-run small business
who is providing Hoosiers with great
jobs and good food, all while supporting
their local community. In honor of the
U.S. Small Business Administration’s
National Small Business Week, it is my
privilege to name Bubbles Ice Cream
Parlor of Michigan City, IN, as the
Senate Small Business of the Day.
Tim and Kim Martin founded Bubbles
nearly 16 years ago and have been serv-
ing premium ice cream to Hoosiers
ever since. Known for always serving
delicious ice cream with a smile, Bub-
bles has become a community staple
and a gathering place for the families
of northwest Indiana.
Today, Tim and Kim’s son, Zach
manages the ice cream parlor, where
they employ many local high school
students as ice cream scoopers. They
serve 32 varieties of ice cream, milk-
shakes, sundaes, and pies. Recently,
they have even started offering hand-
made donuts on weekend mornings. At
Bubbles, you can always expect a deli-
cious treat and a family-friendly at-
mosphere.
Bubbles is dedicated to more than
just their delicious desserts. They are
committed to giving back to their
community. They are a sponsor of
Michigan City High School, provide ice
cream rewards to elementary students
who reach various academic goals, and
donate ice cream to local philan-
thropies.
These fantastic treats, friendly serv-
ice, and community commitment have
not gone unnoticed. Bubbles has been
awarded the News-Dispatch’s Readers’
Choice Award for 8 consecutive years.
They are a prime example of a small
business’s ability to provide a great
product, a welcoming smile, and a
helping hand—all in a day’s work.
Small businesses are the backbone of
local communities throughout Indiana.
They provide dignified jobs to rural
communities and support schools,
charities, and nonprofits. I would like
to extend my sincerest congratulations
to the Martin family and all of the em-
ployees at Bubbles Ice Cream Parlor
for being named the Senate Small
Business of the Day. I look forward to
watching your continued growth and
success.∑

f
PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and
were referred or ordered to lie on the
table as indicated:
POM–51. A concurrent resolution adopted
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana
urging the United States Congress to take
such actions as are necessary to review and
consider eliminating provisions of federal
law which reduce Social Security benefits
for those receiving pension benefits from cer-
tain federal, state, or local government re-
tirement or pension systems, plans, or funds;
to the Committee on Finance.
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 34
Whereas, the Congress of the United States
of America has enacted both the Government
Pension Offset (GPO), reducing the spousal
and survivor Social Security benefit, and the
Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), re-
ducing the earned Social Security benefit,
payable to any person who also receives a
public pension benefit earned in public em-
ployment not covered by Social Security;
and
Whereas, the GPO can negatively affect a
retired public employee receiving a federal,
state, or local government retirement or
pension benefit earned in employment not
covered by Social Security who would also
be entitled to a Social Security benefit
earned by the retiree’s spouse; and
Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the
spousal or survivor Social Security benefit
by two-thirds of the amount of the federal,
state, or local government retirement or
pension benefit received by the retired public
employee, in many cases completely elimi-
nating the Social Security benefit even
though the retiree’s spouse paid Social Secu-
rity taxes throughout the marriage; and
Whereas, according to the Congressional
Research Service, nearly seven hundred
thousand people were affected by the GPO in
December 2017, including more than twenty-
six thousand Louisianians; and
Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons
who have earned federal, state, or local gov-
ernment retirement or pension benefits in
public employment not covered by Social Se-
curity, in addition to paying social security
taxes while working in employment covered
by Social Security; and
Whereas, the WEP reduces the earned So-
cial Security benefit using an averaged in-
dexed monthly earnings formula and may re-
duce Social Security benefits for affected
persons by as much as one-half of the retire-
ment benefit earned as a public servant in
employment not covered by Social Security;
and
Whereas, the WEP causes hardworking in-
dividuals to lose a significant portion of the
Social Security benefits that they earned
themselves; and
Whereas, according to the Congressional
Research Service, more than eight hundred
thousand people, or about three percent of
all Social Security beneficiaries were af-
fected by the WEP in December 2017; and
Whereas, in certain circumstances both the
WEP and the GPO can be applied to a quali-
fying survivor’s benefit, each independently
reducing the available benefit and, in com-
bination, eliminating a large portion of the
total Social Security benefit available to the
survivor; and
Whereas, because of the calculation char-
acteristics of the WEP and the GPO, they
have a disproportionately negative effect on
employees working in lower-wage govern-
ment jobs, like teachers, school workers, and
state employees; and
Whereas, the number of people affected by
the WEP and the GPO is growing as nearly
ten thousand baby boomers attain retire-
ment age each day; and
Whereas, individuals drastically affected
by the WEP and the GPO may have no choice
but to return to work after retirement in
order to make ends meet, but the earnings
accumulated during reemployment in the
public sector may further reduce the Social
Security benefits the individual is entitled
to; and
Whereas, the WEP and the GPO are estab-
lished in federal law, and repeal or reduction
of the WEP and the GPO can be enacted only
by Congress. Therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana
does hereby memorialize the United States
Congress to take such actions as are nec-
essary to review the Government Pension
Offset and the Windfall Elimination Provi-
sion Social Security benefit reductions and
to consider eliminating or reducing them. Be
it further
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution
shall be transmitted to the secretary of the
United States Senate and the clerk of the
United States House of Representatives and
to each member of the Louisiana delegation
to the United States Congress.
POM–52. A concurrent resolution adopted
by the Legislative Assembly of the Common-
wealth of Puerto Rico requesting the United
States Congress to provide the United States
citizens residing in Puerto Rico with equal
treatment regarding the right to receive
Supplemental Security Income (SSI); to the
Committee on Finance.
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 95
It is well known that on Monday, February
4, the Chief Judge of the United States Dis-
trict Court for the District of Puerto Rico,
the Hon. Gustavo Gelpı́, dismissed a com-
plaint filed by the Federal Government filed
against a U.S. citizen alleging that by mov-
ing to Puerto Rico said citizen lost his Sup-
plemental Security Income (SSI) benefit.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2645
May 6, 2019
The SSI is a program available to aged,
blind, and disabled people with low income,
including children.
In United States of America v. Jose Luis
Vaello Madero (Case No. 17–2133 (GAG)), the
Federal Government commenced an action
against Mr. Vaello to collect $28,000 in over-
paid SSI benefits after he moved from New
York to Loı́za. These monthly disability ben-
efits were deposited directly into his New
York bank account. The basis for said com-
plaint was that the SSI program is not avail-
able to territories. Hence, the Government
argued that Vaello had forfeited his right to
receive SSI disability benefits after he
moved to Puerto Rico and that he was liable
for any overpayments.
Mr. Vaello, represented by a Court-ap-
pointed pro bono counsel, challenged the
criminal statute used by the plaintiff as a
basis for the civil action and attacked the
constitutionality of denying SSI benefits to
residents of Puerto Rico.
We agree with the Honorable Judge, Gus-
tavo Gelpı́, and the Honorable Resident Com-
missioner, Jenniffer González, that exclud-
ing Puerto Rico from the SSI program is a
violation of the equal protection guarantees
of the Due Process Clause. In dismissing the
complaint filed by the plaintiff, Judge Gelpı́
cited the per curiam Supreme Court decision
in Califano v. Torres, 435 U.S. 1–1978, and sub-
sequently, in Harris v. Rosario, 446 U.S. 651–
1980, as the basis that allows the Federal
Government to discriminate against the resi-
dents of Puerto Rico in what pertains to fed-
eral programs, such as the SSI. He affirmed
that the U.S. Congress does not have carte
blanche to discriminate against territories
at its convenience.
‘‘Congress [. . .] cannot demean and brand
said United States citizen while in Puerto
Rico with a stigma of inferior citizenship to
that of his brethren nationwide,’’ Gelpı́ stat-
ed in his opinion. (https://
www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/tribunales/
nota/juezdesestimademandadel
gobiernofederalcontraun residentedelaisla-
2474754/)
On February 4, the Honorable Jenniffer
González-Colón, Resident Commissioner, in-
troduced into Congress H.R. 947—Supple-
mental Security Income Equality Act, which
seeks to extend the SSI program to the U.S.
citizens residing in Puerto Rico. This bill
was introduced also by Congress members of
Puerto Rican descent, namely, José Serrano,
Darren Soto, and Nydia Velázquez, as well as
the delegates of the Virgin Islands, the
American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Is-
lands, and Guam. The Legislative Assembly
of Puerto Rico supports this bipartisan effort
in the U.S. Congress and, therefore, requests
Congress to pass said bill, or a similar
version that guarantees the same rights to
all U.S. citizens during this session.
We most certainly believe that the con-
stitutional rights of equal protection and
due process of law must apply to U.S. citi-
zens residing in Puerto Rico. For all of the
foregoing, it is our duty to request the Con-
gress, through this Concurrent Resolution,
to pass legislation and recognize the claim
for social justice and equal treatment before
the law of the over three million Puerto
Ricans who are U.S. citizens.
Be it resolved by the Legislative Assembly of
Puerto Rico:
Section 1.—To request the Congress of the
United States of America to pass legislation
that provides for equal treatment for the
United States citizens residing in Puerto
Rico regarding the right to receive Supple-
mental Security Income (SSI); and for other
related purposes.
Section 2.—It is hereby ordered that a copy
of this Concurrent Resolution translated
into English be delivered to the leadership of
the Congress of the United States of Amer-
ica.
Section 3.—This Concurrent Resolution
shall take effect upon its approval.

SEC. 5005. DUPLICATION DETERMINATIONS BY
THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OF-
FICE.
(a) DEFINITION.—In this section, the term
‘‘covered legislation’’ means a bill or resolu-
tion of a public character reported by any
committee of the Senate.
(b) DUPLICATION DETERMINATIONS BY THE
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE.—Any esti-
mate provided by the Congressional Budget
Office under section 402 of the Congressional
Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 653) for covered
legislation shall include an analysis that in-
cludes—
(1) a determination of whether the covered
legislation creates any new Federal program,
office, or initiative that would duplicate or
overlap with any existing Federal entity
with similar mission, purpose, goals, or ac-
tivities; and
(2) a listing of all such instances of dupli-
cation or overlapping created by the covered
legislation.
SEC. 5006. BREAKDOWN OF COST ESTIMATES BY
BUDGET FUNCTION.
Any cost estimate prepared by the Con-
gressional Budget Office shall specify the
percentage of the estimated cost that is
within each budget function.
SEC. 5007. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TREAT-
MENT OF REDUCTION OF APPRO-
PRIATIONS LEVELS TO ACHIEVE
SAVINGS.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the fol-
lowing:
(1) H. Con. Res. 448 (96th Congress), the
concurrent resolution on the budget for fis-
cal year 1981, gave authorizing committees
reconciliation instructions which amounted
to approximately two-thirds of the savings
required under reconciliation.
(2) The language in H. Con. Res. 448 re-
sulted in a debate about how reconciling dis-
cretionary spending programs could be in
order given that authorizations of appropria-
tions for programs did not actually change
spending and the programs authorized would
be funded through later annual appropria-
tion. The staff of the Committee on the
Budget of the Senate and the counsel to the
majority leader advised that upon consulta-
tion with the Parliamentarian, the original
instructions on discretionary spending would
be out of order because of the phrase, ‘‘to
modify programs’’. This was seen as too
broad and programs could be modified with-
out resulting in changes to their future ap-
propriations.
(3) To rectify this violation, the Com-
mittee on the Budget of the Senate reported
S. Con. Res. 9 (97th Congress), revising the
congressional budget for the United States
Government for fiscal years 1981, 1982, and
1983, to include reconciliation, which revised
the language in the reconciliation instruc-
tions to change entitlement law and ‘‘to re-
port changes in laws within the jurisdiction
of that committee sufficient to reduce appro-
priations levels so as to achieve savings’’.
(4) This was understood to mean changes in
authorization language of discretionary pro-
grams would be permissible under reconcili-
ation procedures provided such changes in
law would have the result in affecting a
change in later outlays derived from future
appropriations. Further it was understood
that a change in authorization language that
caused a change in later outlays was consid-
ered to be a change in outlays for the pur-
pose of reconciliation.
(5) On April 2, 1981, the Senate voted 88 to
10 to approve S. Con. Res. 9 with the modi-
fied reconciliation language.
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense
of the Senate that committees reporting
changes in laws within the jurisdiction of
that committee sufficient to reduce appro-
priations levels so as to achieve savings shall
be considered to be changes in outlays for
the purpose of enforcing the prohibition on
extraneous matters in reconciliation bills.
SEC. 5008. PROHIBITION ON PREEMPTIVE WAIV-
ERS.
In the Senate, it shall not be in order to
move to waive or suspend a point of order
under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2
U.S.C. 621 et seq.) or any concurrent resolu-
tion on the budget with respect to a bill,
joint resolution, motion, amendment,
amendment between the Houses, or con-
ference report unless the point of order has
been specifically raised by a Senator.
SEC. 5009. ADJUSTMENTS FOR LEGISLATION RE-
DUCING APPROPRIATIONS.
The Chairman of the Committee on the
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions in effect under section 302(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C.
633(a)) and the allocations of a committee or
committees, aggregates, and other appro-
priate levels in this resolution for any bill or
joint resolution considered pursuant to sec-
tion 3001 containing the recommendations of
one or more committees, or for one or more
amendments to, a conference report on, or
an amendment between the Houses in rela-
tion to such a bill or joint resolution, by the
amounts necessary to accommodate the re-
duction in the amount of discretionary ap-
propriations for a fiscal year caused by the
measure.
SEC. 5010. AUTHORITY.
Congress adopts this title under the au-
thority under section 301(b)(4) of the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C.
632(b)(4)).
SEC. 5011. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.
Congress adopts the provisions of this
title—
(1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power
of the Senate, and as such they shall be con-
sidered as part of the rules of the Senate and
such rules shall supersede other rules only to
the extent that they are inconsistent with
such other rules; and
(2) with full recognition of the constitu-
tional right of the Senate to change those
rules at any time, in the same manner, and
to the same extent as is the case of any other
rule of the Senate.
