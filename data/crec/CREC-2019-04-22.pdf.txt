HONORING AMARA MARTIN, EXEC-
UTIVE DIRECTOR OF DRESS FOR
SUCCESS DENVER
HON. JASON CROW
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 22, 2019
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is with great
honor I recognize the accomplishments of
Amara Martin, whom The Chamber of North-
west Douglas County is honoring as a
‘‘Woman Who Soars.’’
Ms. Martin is the Executive Director of
Dress for Success Denver, an organization
that aims to empower women to achieve eco-
nomic independence by providing a network of
support, professional attire, and the develop-
ment tools to thrive in work and in life. Poverty
often affects women the most, and its effects
on them and their families can be long-lasting.
One hundred percent of Dress for Success cli-
ents lived under the poverty level before com-
ing to them.
Under Ms. Martin’s guidance, Dress for Suc-
cess has grown beyond addressing women’s
needs and recognizing the significant role
women play in economic development. They
not only improve the quality of life for not only
that woman, but also her family, future gen-
erations, and her community.
In 2017, 85 percent of the graduates of their
Going Places Network program secured em-
ployment. Their other programs provide em-
ployed clients with support, information, and
inspiration to move forward with their career
development, and over 600 women utilized the
Career Center program that offers one-on-one
meetings with executive coaches.
Both a leader and an asset to her organiza-
tion and to the community, she truly is deserv-
ing of such an honor. I congratulate Ms. Mar-
tin for receiving the recognition as a ‘‘Woman
Who Soars.’’
f
HONORING MARILEE K. SCAFF
HON. JUDY CHU
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 22, 2019
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of
Marilee K. Scaff, who passed away on March
8th, 2019 at the age of 103. Ms. Scaff was an
active member of the Claremont community
for nearly 70 years and her passion for public
service, education, and the outdoors will leave
a positive impact for years to come.
Marilee Scaff was born in San Marcos,
Texas, on November 27th, 1915. As her father
worked on the Southern Pacific Railroad, her
family lived in several communities across the
southwest, instilling in her an early love of na-
ture. She eventually settled in Austin for col-
lege on a Girl Scouts scholarship, setting her
sights on a sociology degree, and later grad-
uate degrees in American history and edu-
cational psychology. Dr. Scaff’s passion for
learning and education would play an ongoing
role in her life, as she taught at El Roble Inter-
mediate School in my district, held faculty po-
sitions at the University of Iowa and the Uni-
versity of North Carolina at Greensboro, acted
as First Chair of the Clinebell Counseling Cen-
ter at Claremont School of Theology, and
served twice on the Claremont Board of Edu-
cation. Dr. Scaff also travelled broadly, serving
as a missionary in the Philippines with her
husband, Alvin, beginning in 1940. She re-
turned to teach there 40 years later, after liv-
ing in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for several years
in the interim.
The Scaffs lived in Claremont periodically
beginning in the 1960s. Ms. Scaff was an ac-
tive member of the Claremont United Church
of Christ, where she established the nursery
school, the Claremont and Los Angeles
Leagues of Women Voters, and a founding
member of the United Nations Association.
She was closely involved with the Rancho
Santa Ana Botanic Garden through the end of
her life, where she gave tours and taught
school children about local wildlife. It was this
same enthusiasm that she brought to commu-
nity efforts to save the Thompson Creek
Spreading Grounds in Claremont, as well as
other sustainability measures, making her the
city’s resident expert on water issues. When a
ballot measure to allow Claremont to acquire
their own water system was placed on the bal-
lot in 2014, Dr. Scaff, who was 99 years old
at the time, was chosen to lead the campaign
effort, bringing that measure to victory by a 71
percent margin.
Marilee Scaff was an integral member of the
Claremont community for more than half a
century, and because of tireless dedication to
service and working towards a better commu-
nity for all of us, I was honored to recognize
her as our 2015 Woman of Distinction for the
City of Claremont. She will be missed by her
three children, five grandchildren, six great-
grandchildren, and the entire community she
loved so dearly, but her legacy will be felt for
years to come.

SUSAN HICKS, CEO OF SKY RIDGE
MEDICAL CENTER
HON. JASON CROW
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 22, 2019
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my honor
today to recognize the accomplishments of
Ms. Susan Hicks, MN, RN, who will be hon-
ored by the Chamber of Northwest Douglas
County as a ‘‘Woman Who Soars.’’
Ms. Hicks has been an integral member of
the Sky Ridge Medical Center in Lone Tree,
serving as a part of their Executive Team
since its opening in 2003. Her experience as
a nurse for over 30 years brought fresh per-
spectives to the Sky Ridge team that were in-
strumental in transforming Sky Ridge into a
destination facility for care. Due to her hard
work and dedication, she was promoted from
her role of Chief Operating Officer to Chief Ex-
ecutive Officer in August of 2014.
She currently serves as a board member of
both the Denver South Economic Develop-
ment Partnership and the Colorado Hospital
Association. She is a past board member of
the HCA Hope Fund and First Commercial
Bank as well as a graduate of Leadership
Douglas County.
Through her leadership positions, Susan
has had an incredibly positive impact on the
community. Her success in the corporate
health care field has inspired many other
women in the Chamber and Economic Devel-
opment circles in the community.
A major contributor and inspiration to the
community, I can think of only a few others
deserving of this honor, and I congratulate Ms.
Hicks for receiving the recognition as a
‘‘Woman Who Soars.’’

TRIBUTE TO BOY SCOUT TROOP 501
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 22, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Boy Scout Troop 501 of La Cañada
Flintridge upon its 100th anniversary.
Established on June 4, 1919, and the first
troop charted in La Cañada, Boy Scout Troop
501 has fostered thousands of future leaders,
with 56 members currently registered. Each
scout works independently toward rank ad-
vancement and can earn up to 135 merit
badges as he completes opportunities in
growth, leadership, and education. Since its
inception, Troop 501 has received generous
sponsorship from La Cañada Congregational
Church, the troop’s sole sponsor.
Through its heritage, dedicated parental
support, and sustainable troop size, Troop 501
has been able to continuously offer a myriad
of outings and events, such as Winter Sur-
vival, where scouts build a shelter out of
snow, and the ever-popular rock-climbing trip
in Joshua National Park that includes a Dutch
oven cook-off. Scouts learn about and partici-
pate in activities like hiking, kayaking, and
camping, as well as develop leadership skills
by serving as Patrol Leaders, Scribes, and
Quartermasters.
To further the troop’s community engage-
ment, scouts have also accumulated service
hours by helping various members of the com-
munity on an array of projects throughout the
years. These projects include trail clearing in
the Angeles National Forest, fence restoration
at Mount Wilson, rebuilding stairways at La
Cañada Congregational Church, and various
service projects for La Cañada Flintridge
schools. By partaking in these and a myriad of
other scout projects, and with the troop’s dedi-
cation to fostering scouts’ leadership skills,

E482 April 22, 2019
Troop 501 has produced many Eagle Scouts
over the last century.
For one hundred years, Boy Scout Troop
501 has been instilling the ever-important val-
ues of good conduct, respect for others, and
teamwork in all members of the troop. Those
who are fortunate enough to be a part of
Troop 501 can attest that this incredible orga-
nization builds lifelong friendships, fosters an
appreciation of the natural world, and provides
quality leadership skills.
It is my pleasure to honor Boy Scout Troop
501 for one hundred years of dedication to
community engagement, service, and leader-
ship. I ask all members to join me in com-
mending their efforts.
HONORING GRACIE PARRISH,
FOUNDER OF THE SHELTER
FOUNDATION
HON. JASON CROW
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 22, 2019
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my honor
today to recognize the achievements of Mrs.
Gracie Parrish, who is being honored by The
Chamber of Northwest Douglas County as a
‘‘Woman Who Soars.’’
On December 31, 2017, Gracie was startled
awake by ‘The Knock,’ the nightmare of every
law enforcement family member. Deputies pro-
ceeded to tell her that 29-year-old Deputy
Zack Parrish, her husband of 81⁄2 years and
father to their 4-year-old Caroline and 18-
month-old Everly, had been killed in the line of
duty.
Upon reflecting on her journey as a police
officer’s wife, she recognized the need for
brotherhood and sisterhood among those who
are directly affiliated with the law enforcement
community. This led her to start The Shelter
Foundation, a non-profit organization to guide
and assist the families of law enforcement offi-
cers through the trials often associated with a
law enforcement career.
The foundation provides education to offi-
cers and their families, a protected and posi-
tive forum for social support, and a place for
officers and their families to foster friendships
and find community through like-minded social
events and consistent connection. They firmly
believe the best time to build a firm foundation
is before tragedy strikes; however, if tragedy
becomes reality, they will stand with those
families.
Described as a pillar of strength for inspiring
others with her courage, poise and persever-
ance, there are few others deserving of such
an honor. I congratulate Mrs. Parrish for re-
ceiving recognition as a ‘‘Woman Who Soars.’’
